        <p>The management epiphany for David Reid came at a center for the disabled in Chattanooga, Tenn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reid, an operations division manager for United Parcel Service Inc. in Salt Lake City, got to where he is by getting things done, and he has  not always been sympathetic, he says, to requests from employees for time off to tend to family matters.</p>
        <p>But earlier this year, while participating in a U.P.S. community service program for managers, he assisted disabled residents at a center called Orange Grove. There he worked with a woman who uses a wheelchair because of cerebral palsy. The entire focus of her life was to muster enough energy from the only motion she could make, a slight tilt of her head, to drive the chair. ''It's easy to take things for granted until you see something like that,'' said Mr. Reid, a 26-year U.P.S. veteran who oversees about 600 workers.</p>
        <p>The experience was a moving reminder of the harshness that life holds for some people, he said, and it made him cringe at the memory of his own coldheartedness years earlier in dealing with a part-time employee. The man had called in asking for time off because his wife was having trouble managing with their disabled child. Mr. Reid told him to get to work or risk losing his job.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's never too late to learn a lesson,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is the sort of lesson that United Parcel wants to teach all its upper managers. With 340,000 employees of every imaginable ethnic background, the lowest paid of whom  start at about $8.50 an hour, the company invests some $500,000 a year to send managers through the four-week program.</p>
        <p>The program puts them to work with nonprofit organizations in one of four locations: New York, Chicago, Chattanooga and McAllen, Tex. Their duties range from building houses with Habitat for Humanity and visiting rural areas of Appalachia to see the impact of poverty on children to mentoring young men, boxing food for the needy and assisting adults with physical disabilities.</p>
        <p>Corporate volunteerism in America has been increasing since the early 90's to the extent that companies even use it in their marketing. But advocacy groups say it is rare to find a program as intensive as that devised by United Parcel. Since the program was created in 1968 in the wake of the civil rights movement, more than 1,200 U.P.S. managers have taken the detour from their ordinary duties to get a taste of life at the low-income barricades. About 50 will participate this year.</p>
        <p>The program is a much-needed reality check, according to Don Wofford, a community relations manager in Atlanta who oversees it. ''You can get locked into that 'I've got boxes to move and people to move those boxes' thing,'' he said, ''but those people have to move themselves, and those people have to be treated fairly and with dignity to do it well.''</p>
        <p>United Parcel makes an effort to send participants to unfamiliar territory to add zest to the experience. Even so, not all of them relish it. ''Some individuals have been assigned, and others have been sentenced,'' Mr. Wofford said.</p>
        <p>Mark Colvard, 42, a division manager in Toledo, Ohio, was one of the assigned. Mr. Colvard recently went to McAllen, about six miles north of the Mexican border, to work in a poor Hispanic community at such tasks as serving lunch at a hospice, doing chores at a home for the elderly and working with incarcerated youths.</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to take an opportunity to try to help a culture that does not even have the basic entitlements such as food stamps and Medicaid,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While there, he helped build an 18-by-20-foot addition that doubled the size of a house where a family of seven lived. Although he and his fellow U.P.S. managers were drilled in basic Spanish, communicating on the building project at times boiled down to stretching a tape measure to the length and width desired or putting an ''X'' on a piece of plywood where a door should go.</p>
        <p>''You really find out how good a listener you are when you don't understand what someone is saying,'' Mr. Colvard said. And that effort has made him a better manager, he says. ''I wasn't as open as I am now,'' he said. ''I take more time with people, probably to a fault because I end up with a ton of work left on my desk at 7 p.m.''</p>
        <p>Terry Baumberger, a union steward for two decades in the Toledo operation, has seen the change in Mr. Colvard. ''The man moves so fast his shadow couldn't keep up,'' Mr. Baumberger said. But now, he added, Mr. Colvard seems more relaxed. ''I think he takes time now and slows down a half a step,'' he said. ''That's good in this job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colvard said the experience had also forced him to take a harder look at the struggles of people in his  workplace. Before he went to McAllen, he said, he had turned down a temporary worker's request for a permanent job, calculating that his budget could not handle the extra expense. But a conversation with the employee at a vending machine and a review of the case resulted in a change of heart.</p>
        <p>He justified his decision with a mental calculation about the potential savings in overtime, he said, but the real reason was that ''it was the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he joked: ''I'm closer to my business plan than I've ever been. If my experience in McAllen has anything to do with that, I need to go back next year.''</p>
        <p>Some employees find the encounters with the poor so searing that they do go back. Patti Hobbs, a communications manager working for the United Parcel airline division in Louisville, Ky., is organizing a reunion of the group she was in that did a stint last year at the Henry Street Settlement, a social service agency on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>One highlight, she said, will be a barbecue under the Major Deegan Expressway like the one they helped a nun set up there for homeless people. At that event, the executives laid out a feast of grilled chicken, hamburgers, potato salad, baked beans and even a birthday cake for a homeless woman named Sharon.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ms. Hobbs joined the nun for her nightly run to take food to the homeless. The nun climbed up a small hill past mounds of trash four feet tall and called out a man's name, she recalled. Suddenly, an arm reached from one of the piles and took the food.</p>
        <p>The man was a former stockbroker, the nun told her, who had lost everything, including his family, to cocaine addiction. ''I'll never forget that as long as I live,'' Ms. Hobbs said. ''This is really an opportunity provided so you don't forget where you came from or what employees are going through.''</p>
