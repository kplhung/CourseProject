        <p>In the most momentous decision of his campaign thus far, Gov. George W. Bush took the least adventurous and least sensational course possible.</p>
        <p>The selection of Dick Cheney was deeply revealing about Mr. Bush's approach to politics and to governing. It underscored that Mr. Bush is generally not a bold risk taker in his public life. He is so confident that he will win the election (too confident, some Republicans say) that he was looking more for a partner who could help him in the White House than on the stump. He wanted someone beside him who is utterly loyal, and with whom he is comfortable.</p>

        <p>In the most momentous decision of his campaign thus far, Gov. George W. Bush took the least adventurous and least sensational course possible.</p>
        <p>The selection of Dick Cheney was deeply revealing about Mr. Bush's approach to politics and to governing. It underscored that Mr. Bush is generally not a bold risk taker in his public life. He is so confident that he will win the election (too confident, some Republicans say) that he was looking more for a partner who could help him in the White House than on the stump. He wanted someone beside him who is utterly loyal, and with whom he is comfortable.</p>
        <p>And his decision suggests that Mr. Bush would be a president who, despite his own lack of seasoning on the national stage, is not afraid to surround himself with more experienced hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney brings so few obvious  political advantages to the ticket that it is clear that Mr. Bush determined that whatever may win him the White House, it would not be whom he picked as his No. 2.</p>
        <p>Even though his decision has dribbled out over the past few days, Mr. Bush's choice had been so unexpected that as recently a week ago, virtually every prominent Republican insider was tossing out names like Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Senator John McCain of Arizona, former Senator John Danforth of Missouri and -- everyone's favorite -- Gen. Colin L. Powell.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bush made no secret of his attraction to General Powell, his calculation was that a choice with more sizzle (and with potential liabilities) was not worth the gamble to his election -- or to his happiness in the Oval Office. Even as Democrats were gleefully digging out Mr. Cheney's conservative voting record in Congress, Bush advisers said they were confident he would never embarrass the ticket. Mr. Bush also passed up an opportunity to try to break the Republican Party's abortion barrier by daring to go with a supporter of abortion rights, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania or Gov. George E. Pataki of New York.</p>
        <p>This less ambitious objective of Mr. Bush was settling on a No. 2 who passes what Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, calls the John Rocker test.</p>
        <p>''It's like the Atlanta Braves and John Rocker,'' Mr. Kerrey said. ''You can't afford to make a selection that becomes bigger than you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's play-it-safe approach may well have stemmed from a determination not to repeat mistakes of the past, namely his father's selection of Dan Quayle. Again and again, his advisers said over recent months that Mr. Bush was insistent less on bringing added value to the ticket and more on not doing anything to  hurt it.</p>
        <p>At their first joint appearance in Austin yesterday -- the most subdued, low energy vice-presidential roll-out in years -- the contrast to the introduction of Mr. Quayle 12 years ago could not have been sharper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney stood placidly next to Mr. Bush, his hands clasped in front of him. The newly burnished ticket did not even partake in the customary overhead victory clasp. The presidential candidate who is derided by critics as being so unpresidential picked a partner whose presence practically shouts: grown-up.</p>
        <p>It was a far cry from 1988 when Mr. Quayle, looking very much like George Bush's son, bounced around the stage in Huntington, Ind., appearing so grateful to be picked that he could not contain himself.</p>
        <p>But while nothing went awry yesterday, it was hardly a rousing debut. It did not approach the energetic tableau eight years ago in Little Rock, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore and their families joined for one of that campaign's most memorable moments. There is no chance that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney will be dubbed the ''hunks of the heartland,'' as were Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''There certainly were candidates out there who were more eye-popping,'' said Paul Light, an authority on the vice presidency at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''This would go down in my book as arguably the safest vice-presidential choice of the last 50 years. I can't think of any one that is this solid, this noncontroversial.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, many Republicans were jubilant yesterday that Mr. Bush had found a running mate who would not lead delegates at next week's Republican convention to utter the dreaded ''A word'': abortion. Mr. Cheney is, safely, an abortion foe. He is also, safely, conservative, but one who gets on well with moderates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's lack of interest in a political quick fix that might play well in a particular state or satisfy certain constituencies also shows that he is mindful of history. The last vice-presidential candidate who actually made a difference in the outcome was 40 years ago, when John F. Kennedy picked Lyndon B. Johnson, who assured him that he would carry Texas.</p>
        <p>The Cheney pick is not devoid of political upsides -- or risks. Mr. Cheney's vast experience in Congress, in the White House and in national security issues will help counter critiques from the Democrats that Mr. Bush is not ready for the White House. While General Powell was not available, it could be that Mr. Bush saw the next best thing in Mr. Cheney, who was also a mainstay of the Persian Gulf war, his father's greatest triumph.</p>
        <p>In introducing Mr. Cheney, Mr. Bush, in fact, sought to score points for picking a partner for reasons that did not appear baldly political. ''I have to admit something,'' he said. ''I didn't pick Dick Cheney because of Wyoming's three electoral votes.''</p>
        <p>Safe it may seem, but not foolproof. One of Mr. Bush's prime advantages over Vice President Al Gore is that he does not have a long trail of Congressional votes to be mined by the opposition. Mr. Cheney does -- and many of his votes are decidedly conservative. For all the stature he brings, Mr. Cheney, who is close to former President George Bush, could suggest to voters that Governor Bush is a daddy's boy. Even with his doctor's stamp of approval, Mr. Cheney's history of three heart attacks is hardly reassuring to some people.</p>
        <p>But many Republicans seemed pleased, if not exuberant.</p>
        <p>''It's as good as he could have done,'' said Charles Black, a veteran Republican strategist. ''It's a risk- free choice.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But in politics even playing it safe has risks.</p>
