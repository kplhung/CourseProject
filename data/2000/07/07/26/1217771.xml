        <p>Thirteen-year-old Jackie Faillace turned off the electricity to the low wire fence, stepped over and began pointing out some of her favorites, as they turned their golden eyes toward her and asked, ''Maaa?''</p>
        <p>There was Mrs. Friendly, who likes to be petted, and Buttercup, her baby from last year. There was Pumpkin and Sweetpea and Olga. And back home somewhere was Moe, a 2-year-old lamb that Jackie used to bottle feed and who is so beloved that his admirers made up a special protest sign for him: ''Hell, no, don't kill Moe!''</p>
        <p>In fact, the United States Department of Agriculture announced last week that, because of a potential threat to public health, it planned to kill all of the Faillaces' sheep and compensate the family. The announcement came after tests on four sheep from a related flock showed signs of some kind of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, the family of fatal disorders that includes mad cow disease. Further tests lasting two years or more would be required to determine exactly which disease it was.</p>
        <p>In all, the department plans to seize and destroy nearly 400 imported Belgian sheep from three Vermont flocks, over the objections of Larry and Linda Faillace, who own 120 of them, and another owner. The owners are challenging the validity of the test results and asking for independent confirmation, saying the sheep have been carefully monitored and were never exposed to feed that could cause mad cow disease.</p>
        <p>The slaughter had been expected to begin today, but instead, the Faillaces and the other objecting owner, Houghton Freeman, came before a judge to have it stopped, and were promised a day in court before any killing could begin.</p>
        <p>At a hearing in Burlington, Judge J. Garvan Murtha, the Federal District Court chief, asked the owners to bring in two experts to testify on Thursday about the science of the test results and asked federal officials to invite their own test expert.</p>
        <p>The Faillaces declared themselves more than satisfied.</p>
        <p>''I hope no other sheep farmer ever has to go through this,'' Linda Faillace said.</p>
        <p>And the government stood by its scientific guns, saying it was confident its decision would be upheld. The Department of Agriculture vowed in a statement to ''continue our efforts to protect American agriculture, and ultimately, the health of the American people.''</p>
        <p>The fate of the sheep is uncertain; government lawyers pointed out today that the law leans heavily on the side of giving agencies broad discretion to take action in an emergency, and any possibility that mad cow disease, which has killed dozens of people in England, had entered the United States would be an emergency.</p>
        <p>But one thing is clear: rarely does a dispute pit the federal government against people who seem to so embody the pastoral spirit of Vermont.</p>
        <p>The Faillace (pronounced Fal-LAYS) family took up dairy sheep farming deliberately and rationally; Larry Faillace has a doctorate in animal science, and the family members chose dairy sheep farming because they saw that the United States was importing millions of dollars worth of sheep dairy products each year. They chose the East Friesian breed from Belgium because it gives about 10 times as much milk as its American counterparts.</p>
        <p>On their rented farm in this mountainous countryside near the Sugarbush ski area, the three Faillace children do the work that inspired the family to name their cheese brand ''Three Shepherds.'' Francis, 16, handles the pasture management; Heather, 14, does the milking, and Jackie, 13, makes the cheese -- and fine cheese it is, experts say.</p>
        <p>''The New American Cheese,'' a glossy book published this year by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, described it as ''stunning,'' and it was recently featured on a Martha Stewart show.</p>
        <p>The family also runs a small grocery store in a 19th-century schoolhouse building that has lately turned into the hub of pro-Faillace activity. Signs outside beg ''Save Our Sheep!'' and early this morning, Francis Faillace could be seen putting the finishing touches on one that read, ''Don't Let Politics Kill the Sheep.''</p>
        <p>Jackie Faillace said the family had a phone tree of more than 100 people who are ready to come to the farm within minutes of hearing that federal agents have arrived to take or slaughter the sheep.</p>
        <p>They include, she said, ''older ladies who say they'll bring their shotguns,'' as well as some people who have suggested bringing their cars to block off the roads leading to the farm, and others who want to handcuff themselves to the sheep. The Faillaces are discouraging violence, but say they are encouraging people to protest.</p>
        <p>Supporters are also keeping a 24-hour watch on the sheep, and friends have taken the family collie for safekeeping, Jackie said, in case federal authorities decided that all the animals on the farm, not merely the sheep, must be killed.</p>
        <p>The grocery store in the schoolhouse may have wooden floors and a community garden out back, but it also has computers, and the Faillaces and their supporters have been using the Internet to get the word out and marshal support.</p>
        <p>In particular, they have found an ally in Tom Pringle, a national expert on mad cow disease, and his www.mad-cow.org Web site, a center for information on the topic. Mr. Pringle questions the government's tests, including the reputation of the Staten Island laboratory that performed the most damning one.</p>
        <p>But some of the Faillaces' staunchest allies are just folks here in the Mad River Valley, seeking to defend the family from what they see as government excess.</p>
        <p>Bob Hansen, a neighbor stopping by this morning, said, ''This is just like trying to take Elian Gonzalez all over again.''</p>
