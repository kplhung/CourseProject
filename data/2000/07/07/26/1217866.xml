        <p>The two-prospect offer the Yankees made on Monday for the Orioles' B. J. Surhoff was apparently not good enough, given that today the Baltimore general manager compared it to a particularly aromatic cheese.</p>
        <p>Syd Thrift, the Orioles' executive, generally talked around questions about the Yankees' offer, which included pitcher Dave Walling, the Yankees' No. 1 draft pick in 1999, along with another player to be selected from a group of three minor leaguers: the Class AA pitcher Brian Rogers, the Class AA shortstop Erick Almonte and the Class AAA pitcher Ryan Bradley.</p>
        <p>But when Thrift was asked if the Yankees' offer was close to being satisfactory, he said: ''Far, yes. Close, no. Way, way far. You can't even smell it.</p>
        <p>''It's close to being like Limburger cheese.''</p>
        <p>When asked about the proposal earlier, Thrift said, ''Just because you were born at night doesn't mean it was last night.''</p>
        <p>Thrift could be bluffing, in an attempt to extract a better offer from the Yankees. More likely, he is serious; talks between the Orioles and the Yankees regarding Surhoff have repeatedly stalled. Before the Yankees swapped Ricky Ledee and two pitching prospects to Cleveland for David Justice last month, they offered essentially the same deal for Surhoff and were rebuffed by Thrift.</p>
        <p>Thrift's suggestion that the Yankees' offer stinks, literally, probably won't help the chances of the dialogue continuing, so the Yankees officials will continue to explore other options. They know what it will take to make a deal for Montreal's Rondell White (Alfonso Soriano), as well as Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero and Oakland's Matt Stairs (the Athletics recently asked for Ramiro Mendoza, again).</p>
        <p>But so far, the Yankees don't seem particularly intrigued by any one possibility. The likes of Cleveland's Manny Ramirez, Houston's Moises Alou and Kansas City's Johnny Damon do not appear to be possibilities.</p>
        <p>The San Diego Padres were prepared to make a deal for Atlanta's Brian Jordan, in order to then ship him to the Yankees for a package of players, but the Yankees do not want to absorb Jordan's five-year, $40 million contract, which he signed before last season.</p>
        <p>Surhoff, 35, said he had heard nothing about the Yankees' offer before reporters approached him today.</p>
        <p>''I'm not even going to speculate on anything with the Yankees, because I play for the Orioles,'' said Surhoff, who repeated that his first preference is to play for Baltimore now and in the future.</p>
        <p>Surhoff has another year remaining on his contract, but an option for the 2002 season should easily vest, with Surhoff scheduled to make $3.5 million in 2001 and $4.5 million in his option.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch Injured</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was not in the starting lineup for tonight's game because of irritation in the inside of his right (throwing) elbow, and he will go to New York on Wednesday for tests, including an M.R.I.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch apparently felt the twinge in his elbow while making an awkward throw at the end of a rundown in Monday's game.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, referred to Knoblauch's problem as minor, and Knoblauch worked out before tonight's game and was available to pinch-hit.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza allowed six hits and three runs in three innings tonight in a Class A Florida State League game tonight, in perhaps his last rehabilitation appearance before he is activated. It is expected that Mendoza will be activated at some point during the four-game series the Yankees will begin in Minnesota on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez threw off flat ground again today and assuming he has no setbacks, he will throw in a bullpen session Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Allen Watson, who is on the disabled list because of weakness in the back of his throwing shoulder, threw about 45 pitches in a bullpen workout today at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla.</p>
        <p>Watson's primary concern was to rebuild the velocity in his fastball -- which had dropped from 90 miles an hour to about 81 before he was placed on the disabled list -- and the initial indications are that his fastball is better.</p>
