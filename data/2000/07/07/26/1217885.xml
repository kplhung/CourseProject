        <p>Correction of July 23 article on festival to celebrate publication centennial of Oz books, which truncated original title and mispelled surname in some copies of actor in movie based on book and of theater where play was staged as part of festival</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a festival in Bloomington, Ind., to celebrate the publication centennial of the Oz books truncated the original title. It was ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' The article also gave a misspelled surname in some copies for an actor who played a Munchkin in the 1939 movie based on it. He is Clarence Swensen, not Swenson. In some copies the article also misspelled the name of the theater where a play, ''Oz,'' was staged as part of the festival. It is the Buskirk-Chumley, not Bushkirt-Chumley.</p>
