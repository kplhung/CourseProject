        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>BAN ON EXECUTING PREGNANT WOMEN  Vice President Al Gore, who supports abortion rights, had said earlier this month that if a pregnant woman faced execution, ''The principle of a woman's right to choose governs in that case.'' Today the House voted unanimously that it did not. In reaction to Mr. Gore's statement that pregnant women on death row should be able to choose whether they are executed before the birth of their child or after, the House voted, 417 to 0, to prohibit any state from executing a pregnant woman. No one has shown that the circumstance has ever arisen. The sponsor of the bill, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, said unborn children had committed no crime. Abortion-rights advocates said the bill was intended to advance the cause of abortion opponents by elevating a fetus to the status of a child. Congress already bars the execution of pregnant women for federal crimes. The bill now goes to the Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>VOTER DRIVE IN NEVADA  Nevada has ranked at the bottom in voter turnout in the last two elections, with 38 percent of its voters going to the polls in 1996 and only 33 percent in 1998. So, hoping to improve turnout this year, a coalition of groups representing the state's women, gays and environmentalists, as well as hotel and restaurant employees and Indians, Hispanics and other minority groups, has begun an intensive, $40,000 voter-registration campaign. ''We're a bit embarrassed about being 50th in the nation,'' said Vicki LoSasso, an official of one of the groups, the Nevada Women's Lobby. Election experts say one reason for Nevada's low turnout is the transient nature of its population, which is among the fastest growing in the nation.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>BUSH PERE IN THE BACKGROUND  Gov. George W. Bush's wife, Laura, and his 24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, will have featured roles at next week's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. And George P.'s father, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, will be doing the rounds of television interview shows off the convention floor. But former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, the biggest Bush stars at the show other than the nominee, will remain mainly in the background, as they have throughout most of the campaign, with no speaking roles that might steal the limelight from their son. ''We want to be careful it doesn't turn into a Bush family reunion,'' one of the convention's co-chairmen, Andrew Card, said yesterday. Mr. Card said Laura Bush would speak to the convention on one of the early nights and that later in the week, George P. Bush and his Mexican-born mother, Columba, would have a featured role, mainly to underscore the work they have been doing in recent months to promote George W.'s candidacy among Hispanics and younger voters.</p>

        <p>SECURITY PROCEDURES  Police officers dealing with the thousands of protesters expected to show up at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in mid-August may be armed with paintball guns that shoot balls filled with pepper spray rather than the colored liquid used in paintball war games. Police officials say the guns have been ordered, but no final decision has been made about issuing them. By deploying the high-powered air guns, the police say they will be able to focus on violent protesters far beyond the range of the pepper spray canisters many law enforcement officers now carry. Meanwhile, federal officials have asked Los Angeles hospitals to prepare for possible chemical and biological terrorist attacks, though the officials say they have no evidence that such attacks are being planned and stress that such precautions are routine for major national events. Protest organizers contend that both the pepper spray and terrorist attack preparations send the wrong message to people coming to Los Angeles to exercise their rights of free speech.</p>
