        <p>This was no explosion of Parcellsian dimensions. That is not -- at least, so far -- the Al Groh narrative style.</p>
        <p>But Groh had seen enough of what he saw as slovenly or indifferent play, and finally, he said today, he broached the subject with his Jets after a lackluster Monday workout.</p>
        <p>''Because things aren't as loud, and not as colorful, there's no less tension and no less note taking than before,'' Groh said at his daily news conference. ''Even if they fail to respond, I will never fail to respond.''</p>
        <p>Groh has told the players in different ways over the past few weeks and months that the Bill Parcells way is not necessarily his way. But this was the first time he had said it in their faces -- albeit with an absence of four-letter words, and with, it is presumed, perfect syntax. Groh chooses his words carefully. Parcells chose his victims carefully.</p>
        <p>Despite a difference in style, Groh wants his players to understand that accountability remains a priority. On Saturday night, the Al Groh era begins as the Jets play host to the Saints in a preseason game; and Groh wants a strong effort.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's a little bit of guys getting to get a better understanding of me,'' he added, alluding to the fact that because of his previous role with the Jets as the linebackers coach he has had less experience with the offense.</p>
        <p>During practice, the Jets' offense wears white, and the defense is in green and, Groh acknowledged, ''I've lived more with the guys in green than the guys in white.'' He also noted that there is a difference between him and Parcells, who remains in charge of football operations for the Jets. Parcells watched practice this morning while saying only a few words to a few players, although at times it seemed he wanted to say more.</p>
        <p>''The style might be different on the surface,'' said Groh, comparing himself to Parcells, a man he coached with in 1968, at Army, and a man he has coached for at Air Force, the Giants, the Patriots and the Jets. But, Groh added, ''The style of how we play isn't different, nor are the judgments that are made on which players measure up and which don't.''</p>
        <p>Groh often quotes Parcells with no hesitation, and does not seem to be trying to erase Parcells from anyone's memory. He even quoted Parcells today in assessing the progress of the third-year player Dorian Boose, a defensive lineman. Parcells, who got the idea from the late Tom Landry, used to say that by his third year, a player had to make it or should be gone.</p>
        <p>Groh has a daily plan about which unit he will watch most closely. The other day he was watching the tight ends when he suddenly shouted to the assistant coach Ken Whisenhunt, ''Ken, get out of there!'' And Groh jumped into the middle of the group and began an explanation of what he wanted done.</p>
        <p>Often, Groh rests against a wooden barrier at a quarter to nine in the morning, watching his players trot onto the field, giving them some encouragement, or mentioning something about what he expects. At moments like this, he seems to be acting almost like an official greeter.</p>
        <p>To one of his favorite defenders, cornerback Aaron Glenn, ''Groh is letting people know that even though he's a different style of coach, there's no blow-off factor.'' In other words, players cannot dismiss what Groh says. Reflecting on Monday's little pep talk, Glenn added: ''If you don't do it the way he wants you to do it, your job is in jeopardy. I think it got across to some people.''</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to take anything light just because you talk light,'' right guard Randy Thomas said.  ''He's the boss, and if you don't do what he wants you to do, you won't be here very long.''</p>
        <p>Now the question for the rest of camp -- and perhaps even into the long season -- will be: does everyone on the team think the way Thomas and Glenn do? On Monday, Groh tried to make sure they did.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The job that JASON FABINI is being asked to do -- switching from right tackle to left tackle -- is comparable to being switched from the bottom of the baseball batting order to the cleanup spot, Jets Coach AL GROH said Tuesday. And Fabini has been so intent on mastering the change, while also recovering from serious knee surgery, that he declined to talk about himself and his progress until Tuesday. ''I have a job at hand, and wanted to concentrate on the job,'' he said. ''I have a very busy day.''</p>
        <p>Fabini sustained his season-ending injury in Game 9 last season in New England while making his first appearance at left tackle (JUMBO ELLIOTT was out with a bad back). ''I've got to improve on my pass blocking,'' Fabini conceded in talking about a job in which he will often be protecting the quarterback's blind side. ''It's a different world he's going to,'' Groh said. ''He'll see a different guy out there -- it's like going from seventh in the lineup to batting fourth. The guys you go against there throw a lot more at you.''</p>
        <p>For the moment, Fabini is skipping some of the more demanding drills, such as leaping over 2-foot barriers. Still, Groh said admiringly, ''Some guys look the part. But he's got the toughness. I'm watching him pretty close for certain things.''</p>
