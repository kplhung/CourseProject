        <p>CHINESE restaurants are often easy to pigeonhole. Food can be classified according to region, while design (or the lack of it) falls into predictable categories. But Funky Broome, an unusual restaurant that opened three months ago in a fringe of Little Italy that has been absorbed into Chinatown, is trying to sidestep those definitions.</p>
        <p>From its odd name, which connotes the irreverence of those nonsensical Japanese T-shirts, to its brightly colored interior, Funky Broome suggests youth and energy rather than conformity. Incandescent plastic panels in lime, lavender and orange compete with zebra-striped back cushions to capture the eye, while polished silver air ducts and the deep blue ceiling offer a soothing contrast. The staff is young, and so is the owner, Caroline Kim, whose background is not in restaurants but in computers.</p>

        <p>CHINESE restaurants are often easy to pigeonhole. Food can be classified according to region, while design (or the lack of it) falls into predictable categories. But Funky Broome, an unusual restaurant that opened three months ago in a fringe of Little Italy that has been absorbed into Chinatown, is trying to sidestep those definitions.</p>
        <p>From its odd name, which connotes the irreverence of those nonsensical Japanese T-shirts, to its brightly colored interior, Funky Broome suggests youth and energy rather than conformity. Incandescent plastic panels in lime, lavender and orange compete with zebra-striped back cushions to capture the eye, while polished silver air ducts and the deep blue ceiling offer a soothing contrast. The staff is young, and so is the owner, Caroline Kim, whose background is not in restaurants but in computers.</p>
        <p>Though the menu is largely Cantonese and Hong Kong, Funky Broome has stirred it up a bit with some Thai touches and by making mini-woks centerpieces. The small woks are set over Sterno flames, which keep everything bubbling hot but can make it difficult to pass around the wok.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some of the dishes are unusual and good, like a delicious vegetarian casserole of nutty-tasting fried lotus roots (not stuffed as the menu suggests) in a gingery sauce with dried cherries ($9.95), and plump and flavorful oysters stuffed with green onions and steamed in a red wine sauce ($12.95). I can't say I tasted any wine, but I loved the oysters nonetheless. I was not as crazy about a casserole of wheat gluten and mushrooms ($9.95), a very beige dish that tastes as dull as it looks.</p>
        <p>Beyond the mini-woks, seafood dishes are excellent, like decoratively scored squid ($9.95) served in a searing spicy sauce, and razor clams in a hot, garlicky black bean sauce ($10.50) that are as tender as they are beautiful in their long and slender shells. Salt and pepper seafood ($9.95), a familiar Cantonese dish of fried shrimp, scallops and squid, is flawless, while steamed jumbo shrimp, butterflied and served in a clear, mellow sauce with minced garlic and cilantro ($15.50), are delicious but a bit of a mess as you try to extract them from their shells. And I love the clean flavors of bok choy greens sauteed with garlic ($8.95), while sauteed water spinach ($8.95) has an exceptional smoky flavor.</p>
        <p>Funky Broome can breathe new life into hoary old dishes like crisp and tender beef with broccoli ($8.95), while shredded chicken with Chinese vegetables ($9.95) is full of distinct and honest flavors. But other dishes like crisp pork chops with a sweet Peking sauce ($7.95) and short ribs with black pepper ($12.95) suffer from a bad case of the blahs.</p>
        <p>At lunch, Funky Broome supplements its menu with some interesting homey dishes, like dried beef that is shredded, mixed with rice and shrimp paste and presented in a cylindrical bamboo serving dish ($6.95), a funky, gingery melange that is altogether winning.</p>
        <p>Funky Broome's appearance is certainly intriguing, like the bright feathering of a tropical bird, but the food sings sweetly as well. It's a wee bit different, which I suppose might be considered revolutionary in Chinese restaurants, but at the end of the meal, as fortune cookies and orange slices arrive, tradition wins out.</p>
