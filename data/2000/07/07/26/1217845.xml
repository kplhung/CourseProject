        <p>The night allied warplanes began bombing Iraq in 1991, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney quietly flipped on CNN in his third-floor Pentagon office, ordered Chinese take-out and sat back to watch the Persian Gulf war unfold.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was concerned about possible losses, but he was tremendously calm,'' a former top Cheney aide said. ''I asked him why he wasn't more nervous, and he basically said that he was confident that everything was done that needed to be done. Once the airplanes were in the air, we just had to wait.''</p>
        <p>In choosing Mr. Cheney as his running mate, Gov. George W. Bush has turned to an unflappable Washington insider whose easygoing exterior masks a steely confidence, a man who, once he makes a tough decision, never looks back.</p>
        <p>''He sort of chews on issues, and chews on them until he makes his mind up,'' said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, ''then he goes on and he doesn't second-guess himself. He has very good judgment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, 59, who served 10 years in the House of Representatives and four as President George Bush's defense secretary, brings stature, decisiveness and decades of government experience to a campaign sometimes short on all three.</p>
        <p>But the real secret to his success may be an ability to wrap a staunchly conservative ideology in a mantle of moderation and civility to get people to trust him and get things done.</p>
        <p>It is not just Republicans who feel at ease with Mr. Cheney, who while in the House opposed abortion and gun control and supported aid to anti-Marxist rebels in Nicaragua and President Ronald Reagan's ''Star Wars'' anti-missile shield. Mr. Cheney has a knack for working with political rivals, colleagues say.</p>
        <p>Leon E. Panetta, a former Democratic congressman and White House chief of staff, recalled that Mr. Cheney was one Republican with whom he could confide during sensitive Capitol Hill budget negotiations.</p>
        <p>''There was never any question he had conservative views, but he was always someone you could deal with and talk to, and never one to demagogue the issues,'' Mr. Panetta said.  ''I trusted that what I said would not be used against me in negotiations.''</p>
        <p>The Wyoming Republican has been a rising star in party circles since he was President Gerald R. Ford's chief of staff, at 34. But that political fire appeared to die out in 1995, when Mr. Cheney ended a brief flirtation with his own presidential campaign, dissuaded by an election shaping up over domestic issues, not security matters. Instead he became chief executive of the Halliburton Company, an oil services and construction company based in Dallas whose revenues have doubled, to $14.7 billion, under his tenure.</p>
        <p>What remains in question is Mr. Cheney's ability to wage a punishing presidential campaign. He is not an electrifying speaker. He is a balding, overweight, middle-aged man who is not especially telegenic, though he comes across solidly on television. He never faced a tough race in conservative Wyoming. And he abhors the scorched-earth politics that came to characterize House Republicans under Speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>''Dick does not bring political sex appeal to the ticket,'' said Bill Frenzel, a longtime friend and a former Republican congressman from Minnesota. ''What he brings is the competence and confidence that if anything happens to the president, the country will have a competent vice president to step in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's selection is the latest in a series of turns that have shaped his personal life and political career.</p>
        <p>He is an Ivy League dropout who  became a doctoral student in political science. He was the No. 2 House Republican on the path to possibly becoming speaker when President Bush plucked him from Congress to run the Pentagon after the Senate rejected his first choice, Senator John Tower of Texas. He was a military neophyte, avoiding the Vietnam War with student and parent deferments, who steeped himself in military tactics and doctrine and became the most pivotal defense secretary since Robert S. McNamara.</p>
        <p>As defense secretary, Mr. Cheney joined a national security team that included Secretary of State James A. Baker; the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft; and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Cheney, 24,000 American troops invaded Panama in 1989 to overthrow Gen. Manuel Noriega.</p>
        <p>When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, it was Mr. Cheney who flew to Saudi Arabia to present King Fahd with President Bush's offer to send up to 200,000 American troops to the kingdom. He clashed with General Powell, who recommended keeping economic sanctions in place longer, and prodded the military to plan a larger, more ambitious counterattack against Iraqi forces.</p>
        <p>From the start, his stint as secretary was auspicious. A week after taking over at the Pentagon in 1989, Mr. Cheney publicly reprimanded the Air Force chief of staff, Larry D. Welch, for privately discussing options for updating land-based nuclear missiles with influential members of Congress.</p>
        <p>A year later, Mr. Cheney abruptly dismissed General Welch's successor, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, for publicly discussing contingency plans for waging war against Iraq.</p>
        <p>Even General Powell, a close ally, was not above reproach. General Powell recalled in his memoirs that after one meeting with President Bush during the gulf crisis, Mr. Cheney pulled him aside. '' 'Colin,' he said, 'You're chairman of the Joint Chiefs. You're not secretary of state. You're not the national security adviser anymore. And you're not secretary of defense. So stick to military matters.' He made it clear that I had taken liberty for license.''</p>
        <p>While Representative Cheney had supported most of President Reagan's military buildup, Secretary Cheney presided over a 25 percent cut in the armed services and oversaw a bipartisan process to close hundreds of military bases. He stunned military analysts by canceling plans to build a $57 billion Navy attack plane, the A-12.</p>
        <p>He vigorously opposed allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces. But when a magazine revealed that his longtime spokesman, Pete Williams, is gay, Mr. Cheney defended him, saying, ''As long as they perform their professional responsibilities in a responsible manner, their private lives are their business.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, discretion is a Cheney byword. When President Bush met with his foreign policy advisers during the gulf crisis, Mr. Baker and General Powell typically briefed their senior aides afterward. Not Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>''Cheney was absolutely mum,'' said Paul D. Wolfowitz, the third-ranking official at the Pentagon, who was forced to beg colleagues from the State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff for a briefing.</p>
        <p>Friends and colleagues say the perception of Mr. Cheney as boring belies his wry sense of humor. After Jimmy Carter was elected president and considered replacing the chief of staff's job with a decentralized ''spoke-in-wheel'' system, Mr. Cheney left a broken bicycle wheel in his office as a warning to the Carter team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney had three mild heart attacks before age 48 and underwent a quadruple coronary bypass operation more than a decade ago. Since leaving the Pentagon, he has battled a weight problem, gaining as much as 40 pounds. But he still hunts, fishes and hikes in the Grand Tetons near his home in Jackson.</p>
        <p>Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Neb., on Jan. 30, 1941. But his father, an Agriculture Department soil conservation agent, moved the family to Casper, Wyo., where young Dick became a captain of his high school football team and president of his senior class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney received a scholarship to Yale University but dropped out in his second year because of poor grades. He traveled around the West, at one point laying power lines for an electric company, before settling down at the University of Wyoming, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in political science.</p>
        <p>He married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, a political scholar and former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. The couple has two grown daughters, Mary and Elizabeth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney entered graduate school at the University of Wisconsin and, at 27, was selected for a one-year fellowship in the office of Representative William Steiger, Republican of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney thrived in the political cauldron of Capitol Hill. When President Richard M. Nixon picked Representative Donald H. Rumsfeld of Illinois to head the Office of Economic Opportunity, Mr. Cheney sent him a 12-page memorandum on how to run the agency. Impressed by Mr. Cheney's ideas and audacity, Mr. Rumsfeld hired him to run the agency's Congressional affairs office.</p>
        <p>As happens so often with aspiring aides in Washington, Mr. Cheney hitched himself to his powerful mentor's rising star for much of the next decade. When President Ford tapped Mr. Rumsfeld to become White House chief of staff, Mr. Cheney went along as deputy.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Rumsfeld was named secretary of defense, Mr. Cheney, only 34, replaced him at the White House, one of the youngest men ever to hold that job. Dispensing with the perks of office, Mr. Cheney commuted daily to Washington in his 10-year-old Volkswagen, rather than a chauffeured government sedan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's popular touch extended beyond Washington's power corridors. William F. Connelly Jr., a politics professor at Washington and Lee University who was a Congressional fellow in Mr. Cheney's office in 1985, recalled a visit to Wyoming with him.</p>
        <p>A group of ranchers had demanded a meeting, angry over the military's plan to use more grazing land to base MX nuclear missiles.</p>
        <p>''These big burly ranchers in sheepskin coats, including one guy chewing a nail, were fit to be tied,'' Mr. Connelly said. ''But Cheney just talked them down. He said, 'Look, this is too important to America's defense.' ''</p>
