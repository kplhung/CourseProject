        <p>Few aspects of Rudolph W. Giuliani's repertoire are more predictable: if there is a major fire, a building collapse, a snowstorm or other emergency, the mayor will be there, rousing the troops and assuring the public not to worry, as he is in charge.</p>
        <p>The last two weeks have been no exception. Mr. Giuliani has stood in front of his health commissioner and emergency operations director, with maps and other logistical aids, offering nearly daily updates on the escalating threat posed by West Nile virus and the city's aggressive response to beat the mosquito-borne virus back.</p>
        <p>Yet somehow, things are playing out differently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's commands are, as usual, quickly translated into action. Central Park was shut down Monday night -- pushing out tens of thousands of New York Philharmonic concertgoers and countless others who use the park -- so the city, on the mayor's orders, could fumigate New York's playground. Pesticide crews have also been dispatched across Staten Island, Queens and parts of Brooklyn and tonight, block by block through much of Manhattan. And with his typical bravado, the mayor sharply criticized state and federal officials late last week when they threatened -- however briefly -- to hold up his campaign.</p>
        <p>But in this case, instead of merely allaying fears, each time television crews and reporters portray Mr. Giuliani's role leading the assault, he is also fueling apprehension about the sometimes deadly West Nile virus and the pesticides the city is spraying to combat it.</p>
        <p>The mayor himself, appearing yet again yesterday at City Hall with top aides to detail the West Nile battle plan, said he was quite aware of the complexity of the assignment. ''You can't win,'' the mayor said. ''You can't win.''</p>
        <p>Any elected official in a community facing a public health threat faces the struggle now before Mr. Giuliani: to meet the demands of informing the public without causing panic. Mr. Giuliani's approach has drawn some criticism, mostly from environmentalists who say the mayor is overstating the risk presented by West Nile to justify what they consider his penchant to apply pesticide.</p>
        <p>Officials in some suburbs have reacted in a more subdued manner. Bergen County, for example, has put off, at least for now, widespread pesticide campaigns, citing steps it has already taken to prevent the spread of the virus. Seven infected birds have been found there since June.</p>
        <p>''We have tried not to call a press conference every time something happens,'' said Thomas A. Ammirato, a spokesman for the Bergen County executive, William P. Schuber. ''It leads to a lot of hysteria and misunderstanding on people's part, and the result is people who are oversensitive to the fear of virus and to any treatment.''</p>
        <p>But given the complexity of the assignment, and the exacting demands of many city residents to know all the details, several health experts said yesterday that as far as they could tell, the mayor was handling this just about right.</p>
        <p>''He is doing what a mayor should do,'' said Dr. Andrew Spielman, a medical entomologist and a professor of tropical public health at the Harvard School of Public Health. ''He is attempting to keep the public as informed as he can. And as long as he does not overdo the spraying, he may be helping to save lives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has no doubt played an exceptionally prominent role last year and so far this year in the city's response to West Nile, said Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff, associate director at the National Center for Infectious Diseases. And the mayor's role has been pivotal, in some respects, he noted.</p>
        <p>''He has been able to convey in very practical terms what the issues are for the public,'' Dr. Ostroff said. ''And that is something scientists sometimes have difficulty doing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani yesterday described his decision-making about how to tackle the virus from one spot to another by alluding to his own deliberations on how to treat his recently diagnosed prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>''There are no easy choices in life,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday. ''It's the same decisions you have to make about your own health. Every medicine you take has a risk factor.''</p>
        <p>''There's no medicine that you would take,'' he added, ''that is going to be effective in dealing with a disease that doesn't carry without it some percentage chance that it could kill you, give you side effects, harm you, and you have to make those choices. And those are the kinds of choices you are making here.''</p>
        <p>As he has jumped from news conferences in Staten Island near what he calls West Nile ''hot zones'' to a Sunday morning briefing at the city's emergency operations center in Manhattan, Mr. Giuliani's message  has generally been consistent.</p>
        <p>Each time an infected bird or sample of mosquitoes is confirmed, following advice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner, the mayor has ordered pesticide spraying in a two-mile radius. It was also Dr. Cohen who recommended that the mayor close Central Park and postpone Monday night's concert.</p>
        <p>But there have been some mixed messages.</p>
        <p>While the mayor has belittled critics who question the risk posed by the pesticides, which he at times imprecisely calls ''not toxic,'' he tells city residents to seal their windows, take in pets and turn off air-conditioners on spraying nights.</p>
        <p>The mayor has also tried, at times, to bring a bit of humor to the matter, joking about how his golf game has been handicapped because of slippery bug repellant on his hands, or about how he was accidentally sprayed last year with a pesticide, but has quite obviously survived.</p>
        <p>Dr. John P. Wargo, director of doctoral programs at the school of forestry and environmental studies at Yale, said several of Mr. Giuliani's remarks had struck him as ''flippant,'' or as unfairly dismissing dangers pesticides may pose, particularly to children and women of childbearing age.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Spielman said he agreed with Mr. Giuliani that there is no sure-fire formula for orchestrating the West Nile response.</p>
        <p>''If you intervene and the intervention is successful, you are criticized for contaminating the environment and spending a lot of money on nothing,'' Dr. Spielman said. ''If you fail, then you are blamed for a investment that was not effective. It's very difficult.''</p>
