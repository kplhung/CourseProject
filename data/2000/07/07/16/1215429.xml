        <p>DAVID TRIMBLE, the leader of Northern Ireland's new power-sharing government, paid a brief visit here recently, shortly before Ulster re-erupted into flames last week and Middle East negotiators hunkered down for endgame peace talks in Washington.</p>
        <p>As one veteran peacemaker to another, he held a comradely chat with Yossi Beilin, the Israeli justice minister who helped lay the groundwork for the Camp David summit, and another with Oded Eran, who ran Israel's preliminary negotiations with the Palestinians. Earlier, in Gaza, he met with Yasir Arafat and other senior Palestinian officials.</p>
        <p>An Israeli reporter buttonholed him and asked him to contrast the parties in conflict here with the two sides of the Ulster dispute. Mr. Trimble refused. ''There is no room for comparison,'' he said flatly. ''The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is much more complex than ours.''</p>
        <p>The disappointed Israeli pressed on: Isn't the Irish problem far more entrenched, with enmities dating back 500 or 600 years?</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble wasn't buying it. The present Irish troubles began barely three decades ago, he replied, while ''your conflict is 3,000 years old.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. From Ulster or from here, peace seekers tend to see the other conflict as one inherited from the past, and their own as one based in the more manageable present.</p>
        <p>Returning home, Mr. Trimble was quickly pulled into the peculiar dynamics of the Ulster ''marching season,'' which celebrates the defeat of the Catholic King James II by the Protestant King William III 310 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians and Israelis, meanwhile, were ensconced in the Catoctin hills, confronting seemingly intractable issues -- refugees, borders, the ownership of Jerusalem -- which are rooted not in ancient history but in Israel's victory over Arab forces here just half a century ago.</p>
        <p>Fresh wounds, however, are the most painful, noted Meron Benvenisti, one of Israel's leading social commentators. ''The conflict here is much more raw, and even among intellectuals there is less understanding of the other side's position and history than you would find in Northern Ireland,'' said Mr. Benvenisti, who wrote his Harvard doctoral thesis on Ulster politics 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Unlike most Israelis who have compared the conflicts, Mr. Benvenisti agrees with Mr. Trimble that the dispute between Israelis and Arabs -- whatever its timeline -- is inherently more difficult. The religious and ethnic division and distrust is more profound, the economic and political disparities are far greater, and at the explosive heart of the conflict are mutually exclusive territorial claims, he notes.</p>
        <p>Yet for all those reasons, he and others here say, Israelis and Palestinians should look at Northern Ireland for instructive parallels, warning signs and, more recently, practical lessons in how to resolve conflicts.</p>
        <p>Not all the lessons are encouraging. The riots that raged through Northern Ireland last week could be seen as a foreshadowing of the internal problems many expect Israel and the Palestinians will confront after a  settlement. With the staunchly loyalist Royal Ulster Constabulary faced off against Orange Order marchers, the parades that had long been a flashpoint for friction with Catholics instead exposed deep rifts within the Protestant community. Similarly, Israeli troops are braced to confront militant Jewish settlers, while Palestinian police are prepared to battle radical Islamist opponents of a peace pact.</p>
        <p>The bloody terrorist bombings by breakaway Irish Republican factions after the Good Friday agreement was reached in 1988 offer another object lesson for the future here, some observers believe. And the fierce resistance within the Irish Republican Army to unequivocal disarmament is likely to have its parallels in the Fatah movement and other armed Palestinian factions after an accord, Mr. Beilin said.</p>
        <p>''These are the two longest-running conflicts since the second world war,'' said Mr. Beilin, who visited Belfast in January. ''In both cases we now seem close to a solution, but in Northern Ireland this week we saw the fragility of the process. Good Friday can be followed by Bad Sunday.''</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Beilin convened a workshop here where Israeli and Palestinian officials traded insights with Irish and British experts in the Ulster conflict.  What struck him most forcefully, he said, is the need for peace agreements to reflect the power of ''symbols and rituals,'' along with more tangible things like political institutions and economic benefits. An example: Mr. Beilin believes Israel should let a Palestinian flag fly over the Dome of the Rock, the crowning monument of Jerusalem's Old City -- an image shocking to many Israelis, but to Palestinians a powerful statement of  their national identity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beilin particularly admires the artful blurring of sovereignty lines in the Good Friday accord. The Republic of Ireland now has a formal consultative role in the Northern Irish government, a concession that for many Protestant loyalists struck at the core of their British identity. Yet in return the Republic withdrew its historic claim on the province and formally recognized  the United Kingdom's rule there for the first time.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has also repeatedly drawn comparisons. In speeches in Northern Ireland he pointed to the Oslo accord as a sign of the possibility of cooperation between once-bitter enemies, and when visiting Israel and the Palestinian territories, he cited the Good Friday accord as an example of what he hoped negotiators could achieve in final-status talks here.</p>
        <p>The most significant parallel is the critical mediation of President Clinton himself, said David Scannell, a veteran Irish diplomat, who worked on the Northern Ireland settlement before being sent to Israel as Dublin's ambassador four years ago. But when looking at the political backdrop to both negotiations, Mr. Scannell  is discouraged about President Clinton's chances for securing a settlement here.</p>
        <p>Israeli polls still show a solid 40-percent-plus opposition to a peace accord, he noted. In the referendum approving the Good Friday pact, support was overwhelming in the Irish Republic -- it passed 94 percent to six percent -- and still resounding in the predominately Protestant North, where it carried by 71 percent to 29 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benvenisti is similarly pessimistic, saying that in the critical ''emotional aspects of the conflict,'' Israelis and Palestinians do not appear ready for a lasting, binding compromise. Yet he adds that the increasing normalization of life in Belfast, with its two long-warring communities, may offer hope for a resolution of the dispute over ethnically divided Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''It used to be said that if you know the solution to the Irish question, you don't know the question,'' Mr. Benvenisti said. ''The same could still be said here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 23, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last week about comparisons between the Israeli-Palestinian and Northern Ireland conflicts misstated the date of the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland. It was 1998, not 1988.</p>
