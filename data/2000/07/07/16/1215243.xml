        <p>INITIALLY, Wendela Taylor was told that violin making was not women's work. But she persuaded the craftsman in Wisconsin to give her a chance anyway. He put her to work re-hairing bows. Then she went to New York City and worked in the Wurlitzer Company's violin division, the management of which was so impressed with her talent that they wrote her a letter of recommendation for a violin-making school in Germany, promising her a job when she completed the three-year program.</p>
        <p>Around the same time, Peter Moes was becoming disillusioned with life at a university in Germany. Mr. Moes, an amateur cellist who was born in the Netherlands of a family of professional musicians, realized he wanted to become a violin maker. Though he was 25, the school's cut-off age, the school in Germany admitted him. That was 28 years ago. Today, the team of Wendela Taylor Moes and Peter Moes -- Moes &amp; Moes Violin Makers -- is based in a carriage house in northern Stamford, and the couple's violins, violas and cellos are used by musicians as celebrated as Yo-Yo Ma.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma went to the Moes (their name rhymes with shoes) shop when it was in London. They moved from England to New York in 1981 and then to Boston in 1991 before settling in Stamford in 1993.</p>
        <p>''We've known him a long time,'' Mr. Moes said. ''Over the years we've done repairs for him, on his Montagnana and the Stradavarius. In the course of doing one of those repairs he picked up a cello that Peter Wiley of the Beaux Arts Trio eventually bought. He played it again later on, when we had our shop in New York on 57th Street, and said he'd been thinking about it. At that point he asked if we'd consider making him a cello.''</p>
        <p>The Moes's did not say yes to Mr. Ma's request right away. They were still tinkering with a model. ''We were after something with the A string,'' Ms. Moes said. ''We had started out with a Montagnana-type instrument, which had a big wonderful bass. The Strads have a great top. We wanted something that did both. There's nothing out there to copy.''</p>
        <p>Four years later, they felt they had achieved the balance, and they built one for Mr. Ma. They delivered it to him in person last year to get the set-up just right and to hear him play it and make adjustments.</p>
        <p>That moment of truth, when they hear one of their instruments in performance, can go either way for the couple. ''If there's something not right, we'll hear it and be depressed,'' Mr. Moes said. ''In this case, it was wonderful.''</p>
        <p>''We're more critical than the players are,'' added Ms. Moes.</p>
        <p>The couple said there is much more to building a stringed instrument than putting it together properly. ''It's almost like being a doctor. You have to be an intern for a while,'' said Ms. Moes, who is 50 years old. Mr. Moes, 53, explained it by saying, ''You try to work for the best. The expertise can only be learned when a lot of old instruments come through.''</p>
        <p>In the middle of the 80's the couple said they realized that they were finally creating instruments with their voice. How did they know?</p>
        <p>''We play so that we have a concept of sound that we're aiming for,'' said Ms. Moes, an amateur violinist.</p>
        <p>The idea, said the couple, is to make the instrument able to do what the player wants. The ideal instrument is one that seems as if it were reading the player's mind.</p>
        <p>The couple led a visitor into their workshop. It takes them and a third worker four months to create a violin, which costs $20,000, or a viola for $25,000, and about six months for a cello, which is $40,000. Every year they travel to the mountains on the border of Italy and Austria to select the maple and spruce woods required, usually about 200 to 300 years old. They bundle the wood and check it as luggage, Mr. Moes explained.</p>
        <p>The couple share different aspects of the signature work so the instruments appear to have been made by the same hand. Mr. Moes likes to do the varnishing and he cuts the F-holes. ''I carve the scrolls, and Peter does this purfling -- the inlays around the edges, and the edges,'' Ms. Moes explained. They produce six to eight instruments each year. The rest of their time is spent making repairs.</p>
        <p>''Last winter, with that cold snap, it caused a lot of cracks, Mr. Moes said.</p>
        <p>But the most common damage to the delicate, wooden instruments is from automobiles. ''The musicians get distracted, and they end up running over their instruments. The insurance companies don't bat an eye,'' said Ms. Moes.</p>
