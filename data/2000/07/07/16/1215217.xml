        <p>The Greater Harlem Real Estate Board will hold its third annual Home Buyers Fair from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday in six large tents pitched on the plaza of the Adam Clayton Powell State Office Building at 125th Street and Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>The fair is aimed at potential first-time buyers. ''Downtown is coming uptown,'' said R. Kenyatta Punter, president of the Harlem real estate board. ''With all the attention being given to the Harlem real estate boom, we want to make sure that the community benefits from this resurgence by keeping the properties here in the hands of residents who have never abandoned the area.''</p>
        <p>Brokers, mortgage lenders and nonprofit housing groups will be offering information from booths set up in the tents. The fair will also include seminars, held inside the state office building, on the home-buying process, educational and financing programs available to prospective homeowners and the credit and mortgage process. One seminar, on residential preservation, is designed to inform residents of the relevance and value of historic homes throughout the community. It will be held in segments throughout the day. Seminars will be offered both in English and Spanish.</p>
        <p>Admission to the fair, which includes entertainment for children -- balloons, face-painting and popcorn -- is free. For information: (212) 987-9858.</p>
