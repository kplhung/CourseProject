        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bernard Weinraub, in ''An Unusual Choice for the Role of Studio Superhero'' [July 9], refers to Stan Lee as the creator of ''The X-Men,'' totally ignoring Jack Kirby's status as the series' co-originator as well as the contributions of the many writers and artists who intermittently revamped the often reincarnated comic book series.</p>
        <p>Also, to set the record straight for the future, in advance of the forthcoming ''Spiderman'' movie and the inevitable article, Stan Lee is not the sole creator of that series either. Steve Ditko shares most of the co-credit for that series.</p>

        <p>No doubt, Stan Lee is a very creative writer, and like Walt Disney, he was (and is) a good director and editor of other artists and writers. Popular myths not withstanding, Mr. Lee is not the sole creator of every Marvel character, any more than Walt Disney was the sole creator of every Disney cartoon, including Mickey Mouse (Ub Iwerks was the mastermind behind the mouse, and was credited with its creation in early movie posters).</p>
