        <p>My childhood did not prepare me to mix with people of other races; in fact it hurt me. I thought my innards would explode just interacting on a human level with black people. It didn't matter who they were -- a housecleaner, a student, a computer programmer -- all that mattered was that they were black. I was convinced that the person I was interacting with could see right through me to my ugly, hypocritical core.</p>
