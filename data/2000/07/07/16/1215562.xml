        <p>Colorado lost its 10th straight game yesterday as Dante Bichette and Pokey Reese homered to lead Cincinnati to a fight-marred 7-4 victory over the host Rockies.</p>
        <p>Scott Williamson (3-6), making just his second major league start, pitched six innings for Cincinnati, which swept the three-game series by a combined score of 31-10.</p>
        <p>The losing streak is the second-longest in Colorado history. The Rockies lost 13 straight during their inaugural 1993 season. They also lost nine in a row last year.</p>
        <p>The game included a bench-clearing brawl in the seventh when Reds reliever Scott Sullivan hit Brian Hunter on the shoulder minutes after Ken Griffey Jr. was plunked in the thigh by Stan Belinda.</p>
        <p>ATHLETICS 6, GIANTS 2: Gil Heredia pitched six and two-thirds strong innings as Oakland defeated host San Francisco to avoid a sweep and snap a three-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>The Athletics won for the first time at Pacific Bell Stadium after two losses. The Bay Area rivals split their six-game series this season.</p>
        <p>Ramon Hernandez and Miguel Tejada hit consecutive home runs as the A's won for the fourth time in 14 games. Randy Velarde and Adam Piatt each had three hits.</p>
        <p>Heredia (10-7) allowed two runs on seven hits. He struck out six, including Barry Bonds three times, and won for the first time in six starts.</p>
        <p>Kirk Rueter (6-5) lost for the first time in eight starts after allowing three runs -- two earned -- on 11 hits.</p>
        <p>ANGELS 6, DODGERS 2: The Rookie Seth Etherton won his fourth consecutive start and Bengie Molina drove in three runs as Anaheim beat host Los Angeles to win two of three in the interleague series.</p>
        <p>Etherton (4-1) allowed two runs, one earned, and four hits over six innings in his seventh career start and first for the Angels since beating Minnesota on June 23 at Edison Field.</p>
        <p>The Angels built a 3-0 lead in the first two innings against Chan Ho Park (9-7) on run-scoring doubles by Tim Salmon and Orlando Palmeiro and Molina's bases-loaded sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>Park, who has lost three consecutive starts after winning his previous five decisions, was lifted after 109 pitches in five innings. The right-hander allowed three runs on six hits and tied a season high with seven walks.</p>
        <p>RANGERS 6, DIAMONDBACKS 5: Luis Alicea delivered his second go-ahead hit for Texas in three games, an 11th-inning triple that sent the Rangers over host Arizona.</p>
        <p>John Wetteland pitched a scoreless 11th for his 23rd save in 27 opportunities. Reliever Jeff Zimmerman (3-4) worked two and one-third scoreless innings for the victory.</p>
        <p>Greg Swindell (1-3) allowed a one-out single to Mike Lamb and retired the pinch-hitter Dave Martinez before Alicea lined his second hit of the game to the left-center field gap.</p>
        <p>Arizona's ace, Randy Johnson, struck out 12 to pass the 200 mark for the ninth time in 10 years, but also allowed five runs, three walks and seven hits in seven and one-third innings.</p>
