        <p>During her years living in New Orleans, Gale Morrison saw the streetcars as a charming amenity. So when she was looking for an apartment in the Paulus Hook section here three years ago, she wasn't bothered by the prospect of modern-day trolleys gliding along Essex Street, a narrow block framed by historic row houses and fast-rising condominiums.</p>
        <p>''I love streetcars, and I'm a strong believer in public transportation, so I thought nothing of it,'' said Ms. Morrison, who edits a computer-chip trade publication. ''I guess I was naive.''</p>
        <p>For those who live along its route, the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has turned into a charmless irritant. With its screeching steel wheels, each passing train is as jarring as fingernails dragged across a chalkboard. At intersections, the conductors sound the kind of air horns used on freight trains. And for those whose upper-floor windows face the line, rooftop machinery sends out a bone-piercing hum. ''It's so bad we can't even open our windows,'' Ms. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morrison and a group of her neighbors are hoping legal action will help rein in the racket. Their lawyer, Michael Gordon, said he wants New Jersey Transit to comply with their own studies claiming the system would have a minimal effect on its surroundings. For starters, Mr. Gordon said, the trains should slow to 8 m.p.h. ''They're using excessive speed and making excessive noise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ken Miller, a New Jersey Transit spokesman, said engineers were working on the problem. ''The gratuitous sounding of horns has already been discontinued,'' he said, although Ms. Morrison and others disagreed.</p>
        <p>''They haven't done anything yet,'' she said. ''They haven't even contacted us.''</p>
        <p>David Phelps, a light-rail specialist at the American Public Transportation Association, said noise was seldom a problem with such systems. ''Motors do hum and warning devices are there for a purpose, but light rail is designed to have minimal impact,'' Mr. Phelps said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Morrison, who is pregnant, said that if the trains could not be hushed, she would move. ''I don't think an infant should be close to so much noise,'' she said.</p>
