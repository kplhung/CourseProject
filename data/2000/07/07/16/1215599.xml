        <p>WALIT-Harriet. The Institute for Community Living was fortunate to have had the loving support and wise counsel of this consummate New Yorker for many years. Harriet Walit, known for her civic-mindedness, compassion and gentle spirit, was our angel of State Street. She and her husband, Leonard, lived in a close-knit community. Harriet stepped forth from day one to help ICL become a true neighbor and to challenge the community to reach out and embrace those less fortunate. Ms Walit, an ICL Trustee and former chair of the ICL Community Advisory Board, brought ideas, counsel and energies that always included a sense of whimsy mixed with a sincere sense of practical thinking. The Walits will be greatly missed. Peter C. Campanelli, Pres/CEO Carol E. Garel, Chairperson</p>
