        <p>Shane Vavera, Amily Mak, NouDeng Sy and Chris Colvin  Oklahoma City</p>
        <p>Vavera (left): Amily's got a good personality, she's fun to be around. Race doesn't matter to me. It's no concern. I mean, I'm half Iranian. But yeah, Asian women, I think they're more exotic. Really, what concerns me about the girl is the eyes, and the Asian women have beautiful eyes, the form and the shape of them. It's a plus for me. I had another Asian girlfriend before. And I like their skin color: tannish, not just white, white, white. A girl with color. It's just different; it's more sexual. It's not just like Plain Jane.</p>
        <p>Mak (second from left): I'd never really dated a white guy. My parents encouraged me to date who I wanted, but I was just hanging out with the Asian community, so I dated Asian guys, who are more traditional. They expect you to clean house and stuff. I think it's hard for them to see a girl who wants to go out and do stuff, not just start a family. Asian guys say rude things to make me feel bad about dating a white guy. They're just jealous. One night I was</p>
        <p>going to be with Shane, and someone said, ''Oh, she's turned white.'' There are definitely people who think Asian girls are hot. It's flattering. Why is it offensive? They're not saying we're ugly.</p>
        <p>Sy (second from right): My mom loves the fact that I'm dating a white guy. I guess it's because I dated three Asian guys, and only one of them lasted over a year. White guys are more laid-back. Asian guys are so scared about impressing people and being responsible that they're stressed out. I'm not saying I would never date an Asian guy, but if I did, it would mean I would be willing to be more homey -- to give up a little side of myself for him. The first time I dated a white guy, a lot of Asian guys looked at me like I was stuck up: ''She's too good to date an Asian guy.'' You know, I used to think guys wouldn't want to date Asian girls. But nowadays, Asian women are in. I hear all this stuff about how Asian women are more exotic-looking, and a lot of guys want that. We all saw ''Road Trip,'' and when that guy said ''I have a thing for Asian women,'' Shane and Matt were like, ''Hell, yeah!'' And Amily and I were like, ''Oh, my God.''</p>
        <p>Colvin (right): What do I like about Asian women? I guess their complexion, their skin tone and stuff like that. Just a real golden color. And I like that Nou's petite, she fits right in my arms. Asian women are more attractive to an extent, but I really like to find out the personality. A few generations ago, it would've been awkward, but now there are lots of multicultural kids.</p>
