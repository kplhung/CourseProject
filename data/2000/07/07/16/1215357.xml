        <p>IT'S treated as a dirty little secret here, but Japan Inc. is embracing, gingerly, one of America's most hard-knuckled business tactics.</p>
        <p>Pressed by a need to streamline their balance sheets, cut costs and drastically upgrade their information technology to regain competitiveness, Japanese companies are farming out chunks of their computer operations to companies like IBM Japan, Fujitsu and NTT Data.</p>
        <p>Japan Inc. is often choosing, however, to forgo one of the most lucrative side effects of such outsourcing -- the shrinking of the corporate work force and the resulting cost savings.</p>
        <p>As American as outsourcing may be, in Japan it reflects a business culture stubbornly resistant to practices that sacrifice employee well-being for the sake of efficiency. Japan's version suggests, more broadly, why technologies and management practices that are propelling the American economic boom have had less impact here.</p>
        <p>When IBM Japan and Daiwa Bank put themselves on the map in 1997 with what was billed as Japan's first real outsourcing deal, the treatment of the people involved was a bigger issue than the business and financial ramifications. ''Given the unique character of the Japanese employment system, there was some initial resistance at the bank and perhaps within society itself,'' said Yoshinobu Ishigaki, general manager of IBM Japan's service business development division. ''Even the government showed some concern about it.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Daiwa deal spawned business that more than tripled IBM Japan's outsourcing revenue. This year alone, IBM Japan, a wholly owned subsidiary of International Business Machines, has scored contracts worth more than $3 billion.</p>
        <p>''We saw a turning point in 1997 -- and it was a sharp one,'' Mr. Ishigaki said. ''Japanese companies realized they needed to demonstrate their ability to change, and maybe more importantly, Japanese society began accepting outsourcing.''</p>
        <p>GIANTS like Fujitsu and NEC are also using outsourcing -- both as providers and as clients -- to meet the new challenges of a global business world that is increasingly reliant on computers and the Internet. Many businesses, particularly those in financial services, realize that they can no longer afford to invest in sophisticated information technology themselves.</p>
        <p>''Banks in Chiba, Ehime, Hokkaido and lots of other places are looking to outsourcing as a way to survive,'' said Fumio Ohue, the partner who until recently headed the outsourcing business of Andersen Consulting and is now chief operating officer of the Netyear Group, a Japanese company that is devoted to providing strategic consulting services online. ''It's hard for them to try to catch up with new products, networks and business management services on their own.''</p>
        <p>Outsourcing is a radical departure for most Japanese companies, which have long taken pride in doing everything themselves, or at least within their cluster of affiliated businesses.</p>
        <p>''There was a sort of all-by-ourselves-ism that developed,'' said Sachio Nishiyama, chief manager of the systems administration division at the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation. ''Now we're casting off that attitude, because we understand that there are areas where other companies can simply do it better.''</p>
        <p>After a year of discussions among senior executives, Mitsubishi Trust handed over to IBM Japan the operation of its data centers and the management of networks linking its sales offices; the deal is worth more than $350 million over the next decade. The bank expects to cut the cost of systems administration by 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The costs would have fallen further if Mitsubishi Trust had sent the 50 employees associated with those activities to IBM Japan. But all were offered jobs elsewhere in the bank, according to Masahumi Abe, manager of the systems administration division.</p>
        <p>''In the U.S. and Europe, this is probably hard to understand, since there, outsourcing is not just IBM Japan taking over the work but also taking over the people,'' he said. ''But in Japan, outsourcing hasn't reached such an extent.''</p>
        <p>Not nearly. In fact, only a few Japanese companies are advertising their move toward outsourcing various aspects of their business, including accounting and human resources. In this land of lifetime employment, outsourcing conjures up an image of job-cutting, which is still in many ways taboo. So most companies would rather not talk about it.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me, but why is The New York Times interested in our outsourcing efforts?'' asked Fumiaki Ito, senior vice president of the Meiji Seika Company, a candy, dairy and pharmaceuticals company that hired IBM Japan in February to manage many of its computer systems. ''We are not the only company adopting outsourcing, you know. It's not such a big deal, is it?''</p>
        <p>Katsuhiko Minami, director of Meiji Seika's information systems department and manager of the 70 employees affected by the deal, was quick to point out that only nine jobs were lost -- and that those workers were given other posts or allowed to retire. ''There are always new needs within the company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Retaining workers would seem to defeat the purpose of outsourcing. But Mr. Minami appeared happy with the 100 million yen, or $943,000, that Meiji Seika would save each year for the five years of its contract with IBM Japan.</p>
        <p>''It's not a lot on a percentage basis,'' he said, ''but it's a lot of money saved nonetheless.''</p>
        <p>At some companies, however, such sensitivities are fading fast. A recent television documentary about NEC's efforts to overhaul itself showed four workers wrestling  computers into shipping boxes, tears streaming down their faces. They were part of a group of 300 white-collar employees, all formerly parked behind desks, who were dispatched to a packaging and warehousing company affiliated with NEC.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for NEC made no effort to explain away the scene.</p>
        <p>''We regard the case shown on TV as outsourcing,'' he said, bluntly declining to use more euphemistic terms for the longstanding practice of sending unnecessary workers to affiliates.</p>
        <p>Others work harder to make outsourcing difficult to distinguish from more traditional business practices here. Mr. Ohue classifies many recently created joint ventures as outsourcing in disguise.</p>
        <p>CONSIDER the case of Toyo Information Systems, an affiliate of Sanwa Bank, and Komatsu, the struggling general building contractor. As part of a reorganization, Komatsu sold 65 percent of its software subsidiary, Komatsu Soft, to Toyo. Komatsu can continue to rely on its former subsidiary and, as a major shareholder, still be treated as a special customer. Yet it shed responsibility for some 700 employees.</p>
        <p>''This is win-win outsourcing done in a very Japanese way,'' Mr. Ohue said. ''I think we'll see more of that kind of outsourcing because it allows everyone to save face and is not as harsh as outsourcing U.S. style.''</p>
        <p>Outsourcing still faces opposition here, no matter how soft the touch. NCR Japan has been one of the biggest outsourcers, moving  1,200 people off its payroll and fighting at least one bitter battle with labor. In 1994, the company temporarily transferred 700 employees to a new, partly owned affiliate to handle maintenance work. Four years later, when NCR tried to make those transfers permanent, some union members took the company to court. The case is still pending.</p>
        <p>That has not discouraged Isao Aoki, head of NCR Japan's human resources operations. ''I introduced outsourcing to this company because I believe it will strengthen the whole company,'' he said. ''It was the only effective way to restructure in Japan, where simply cutting jobs is considered unjustifiable.''</p>
