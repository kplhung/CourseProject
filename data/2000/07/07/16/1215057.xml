        <p>MAMA, ACROSS THE SEA. Written and illustrated by Alex Godard. Adapted from the French by George Wen. Holt. $16.95. (Ages 4 to 8) Cecile sits on the hot roof of a tiny house on a tiny tropical island, waiting for her mother. Her father was lost at sea, and now Mama has gone away to work in a cold country, leaving the little girl with her illiterate grandparents. Cecile, who can read and write, gives lessons to her grandmother. One day a letter from Mama brings an invitation for Cecile to go and visit. The blurred faces in lush illustrations do not diminish the tale's complex emotions. It's a thought-provoking story for children whose caretakers may deeply miss other children living far, far away.</p>
