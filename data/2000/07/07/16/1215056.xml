        <p>SHIVA'S FIRE</p>

        <p>Long before multiculturalism, long before diversity, and eons before any schoolchild had heard of ethnicity, there were filmstrips. You filed into the auditorium, delighted to get a brief holiday from the terminal boredom of social studies, and spent the next 30 minutes dozing through scratchy black-and-white footage of people sitting on the ground and eating with their hands. A voice-over spelled it all out: the natives of Someplace, at their morning meal of Something, after which the boys go off to do This and the girls go off to do That. Whoever these people might be in real life, it was always made clear by the narrators that as far as we kids were concerned, foreigners had only one role to play: friends from many lands.</p>
        <p>Teaching and filmmaking have changed a lot in the last half-century, but it's still hard to persuade schoolchildren that foreign countries matter. Indeed, judging from the dwindling amount of foreign news in the press and on television, there's no great confidence in America that anyone at all is interested in nations far from home. Small wonder that so few authors of children's books take up the challenge of luring readers into a world utterly different from the one they already know. Chinese legends and African folk tales abound in picture books, but almost nobody ventures onto the forbidding terrain that Suzanne Fisher Staples has dared to make her specialty: realistic young-adult fiction about growing up in India and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Staples, who spent many years in South Asia as a reporter for United Press International, has an admirably detailed knowledge of the region. ''Shabanu,'' her first and best-known book, is set among the nomads of the Cholistan desert in northwestern India and describes how a strong-minded girl is tamed -- partly -- by a powerful, traditional Muslim society. The sequel, ''Haveli,'' follows Shabanu into her restricted life as a rich landowner's fourth wife. Now, with ''Shiva's Fire,'' Staples moves into a very different world. This time we're in South India, steeped in Hinduism rather than Islam, with a girl who's an artist, not a rebel. Instead of camels and sandstorms, Parvati's coming of age is played out against a background of bharata natyam, the rigorous classical dance style rooted in South India's temple rituals.</p>
        <p>Parvati lives in a far more refined environment than Shabanu's, and she's quieter and more introspective. The excitements that swirl about her story are rooted less in events than in an otherworldly dimension of her character: Parvati has mystic powers. She's born just before a cyclone that devastates her village, but while other children waste away from the lack of food, the infant Parvati thrives on her mother's strangely abundant milk. As a baby, she sees all that happens around her and remembers it; as a child, she meets a cobra that refuses to attack her. Parvati's mother manages to save their statue of Shiva, lord of the dance, from the cyclone; and when Parvati gazes at it, she sees the god dancing for real in a circle of fire. At 12 she's invited to train at a great dance academy, where she finds that the centuries-old art emerges easily from her arms and legs, as if it's been waiting there.</p>
        <p>As always, Staples sets her scenes with immense care. Parvati's story moves from the village of her childhood to the austere confines of the school and finally to a climax at a maharajah's palace; and every locale emerges in precisely delineated color, sound and sensibility. ''The Guru sat on a straw mat on the floor, a vase of tuberoses beside him,'' she writes, describing Parvati's first private lesson with the school's master. ''Flames danced on more than a dozen wicks set in the small vessels of a many-tiered bronze lamp. Birds flitted in and perched atop the rolled shades. Parvati kicked off her sandals and set them on the step before entering and bowing to the Guru. The polished cement floor felt warm under her bare feet.''</p>
        <p>This ability to create a coherent world out of materials so foreign to her readers is Staples's prime gift as a novelist. What's missing in ''Shiva's Fire'' is a plot sufficiently developed to support everything that happens. Tragedies and mysteries tumble forth; but nothing seems to connect one development to the next, and loose ends pile up disconcertingly. What's the importance of the bandit who runs off with Parvati's best friend? Why are the jewels for Parvati's costume lost, then found? And most nagging of all, what are we to make of Parvati's miraculous powers? This crucial aspect of the heroine should be mysterious and suggestive; instead, it's just puzzling. Staples's style this time around is problematic, too: sometimes her prose is vivid; other times it's so plain-spoken it sounds as blunt and educational as the filmstrips of yore. Fans of ''Shabanu'' and ''Haveli'' will be able to enjoy ''Shiva's Fire'' for its exotic setting and ambitious heroine, but newcomers to Staples's work may find this one a slow and bumpy road to a far-off place.</p>
