        <p>In recent years, you would hear the question at barbecues and parties on the North Shore of Staten Island: Whatever happened to the peacocks of St. George?</p>
        <p>They were a handsome pair, large for their species at six feet tall, and given to public preening. But these peacocks were not flesh-and-blood birds. They were wrought-iron, nickel-plated sculptures, with a subtle verdigris sheen, that for decades were attached to the front doors of the Ambassador Apartments at 30 Daniel Low Terrace.</p>

        <p>In recent years, you would hear the question at barbecues and parties on the North Shore of Staten Island: Whatever happened to the peacocks of St. George?</p>
        <p>They were a handsome pair, large for their species at six feet tall, and given to public preening. But these peacocks were not flesh-and-blood birds. They were wrought-iron, nickel-plated sculptures, with a subtle verdigris sheen, that for decades were attached to the front doors of the Ambassador Apartments at 30 Daniel Low Terrace.</p>
        <p>They were there when the Art Deco building opened in 1932. And they were there in the 1950's and early 1960's, when the building was briefly a haven for young actors like Paul Newman and Martin Sheen. Then eight years ago they were gone.</p>
        <p>One admirer of the sculptures is David Goldfarb, a board member of the New York City Historic Districts Council. He lives two blocks from the Ambassador, and says he has been trying to discover the fate of the peacocks since they went missing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldfarb had heard rumors that the building's previous owner had sold them to an antiques shop in Manhattan that carried objects from old buildings. So he poked around in the shops, thinking that if he found them, he would raise the money to restore the birds to their perch. But he could not find them.</p>
        <p>Still, it turns out that the rumors were true. Bryan Windsor, an antiques dealer from nearby West Brighton, said he had bought the peacocks from the building's previous owner in 1992. He said he put them on sale in his store in SoHo where after a year a couple bought them.</p>
        <p>The couple wanted the sculptures to adorn a condominium they planned to build in Florida, Mr. Windsor said, but the condominium was never built. So three years ago the couple asked him to resell the peacocks, which he did, he said, to a couple from the city who planned to install them in their home.</p>
        <p>Here the trail grows cold. Mr. Windsor said he had no more information on the peacocks because he closed his store last month and all his records were in boxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldfarb said he would like to speak to the new owners and make an offer for the sculptures. Local civil groups have asked the Landmarks Preservation Commission to consider designating as a historic district a section of St. George that includes the Ambassador so the peacocks, once restored, could not be removed.</p>
        <p>''They completed the facade of the building,'' Mr. Goldfarb said. ''They were really a neighborhood asset.''</p>
