        <p>WHAT we're going to do today,'' the drama counselor said to the girls of Bunk One, ''is we're going to be models. We're going to put some makeup on. Do our hair. Put on some clothes. And then we're going to have a fashion show.''</p>
        <p>Out came the eyeliner, the red lipstick, the sparkly nail polish, the scarves and fancy dresses. A camper named Lauren declared her done-up bunk mates ''gorgeous.''</p>
        <p>These campers are not models in the outside world. They are exceptions, delicately and ambiguously called special.</p>
        <p>Here at Camp Loyaltown, in the shadow of Hunter Mountain, they are ordinary -- the adults with Down syndrome, the autistic children, the emotionally and mentally limited, the childlike spirits frozen in wrinkled, stooped bodies.</p>
        <p>They swim and sing and put on plays and shout silly cheers in the cafeteria and pump themselves up for a softball game against a rival camp.</p>
        <p>Those who can talk, do, some engagingly. Those given to hugging, hug indiscriminately. Some are sullen and moody. Many are silent and smiling. They produce a newspaper, The Happy Camper, and it probably has less fibbing than you'd find in most house organs.</p>
        <p>''It's like a dream,'' said Vanessa Radke, 30, a counselor from London. ''You have to come back to make sure it's real.''</p>
        <p>She's returned nine summers, drawn by a camper with Down syndrome named Patty. ''She's about my age and she's just amazing,'' Ms. Radke said. ''She has very little speech. She's just so lovely. She speaks to me with her eyes.''</p>
        <p>People here often refer to a short essay called ''Welcome to Holland.'' In it, a parent likens raising a disabled child to planning a vacation to Italy, only to have the plane land in the Netherlands. Sorely disappointed, you find the Netherlands slower and more drab. But eventually you discover the windmills and the tulips and the Rembrandts. ''It's just a different trip,'' a camper's father said.</p>
        <p>Each summer more than 500 people attend the camp, run by the Nassau County chapter of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children. Paul H. Cullen, the camp director for 22 years, hires 150 counselors from around the world and strives for an environment where the disabled ''do not experience their handicap as interfering with their enjoyment of life.''</p>
        <p>It is also a respite for parents.</p>
        <p>''These kids are all-consuming,'' said Sloan Ettinger, visiting her 18-year-old stepdaughter, Brandy, who is the size of a 4-year-old and rides in a stroller. ''Imagine having a toddler in your house for 38 years.''</p>
        <p>THE campers stay in bunks, which, like bunks everywhere, are summer societies of complex characters. Bunk One has Gabbi, at 13 a social butterfly with Down syndrome, as strong-willed as she is well spoken, depending on her mood. There is Lauren, 19, an inveterate Islanders fan with a revolving list of favorite counselors, mostly males.</p>
        <p>There is Brandy, her little hands forever reaching for someone to touch, and Melissa, 18, always willing to hold them. Chrissy, 21, is silent, but meets everyone's eye with a smile. Katie, 20, has Down syndrome, and sometimes surprises with her enthusiasm, as when singing ''Happy Birthday'' to campers during lunch.</p>
        <p>The other day, the six baked an apple crumble, dressed for their fashion show and made witches out of pipe cleaners and fabric. (''It's not a witch,'' Lauren insisted. ''It's my Islanders guy!'') Lauren complained loudly at lunch that Gabbi's banging was giving her a headache. Brandy told her visiting stepmother in a slow, determined voice, ''I love you, too.'' The counselors recounted the thrill of getting Gabbi out of bed in the morning or helping Chrissy learn to shower herself.</p>
        <p>In the late morning, Julie Trimble, a counselor from Belfast, Northern Ireland, announced it was time for cooking class. Gabbi assumed her usual traveling position -- on Julie's back. Gabbi pressed her freckled cheek against Julie's, and they laughed and said together what Julie always teases in her Irish lilt, ''You're a big, lazy lump.''</p>
        <p>They all felt lazy. The night before had been Karaoke Night. The girls in Bunk One had performed ''Holiday'' by Madonna.</p>
        <p>Counselors and campers crowded the recreation hall. The music deafened. A bubble machine belched bubbles. Lights flashed. The wooden floor bounced. Campers and counselors moved to the same music. On stage, Melissa grabbed the mike. Gabbi, refusing to sing at first, came alive, screaming wildly, dancing with her head thrown back. Even Brandy, in the arms of a counselor, bobbed up and down. The room was in a roar. For a moment, ''special'' and ''normal'' didn't matter. It was just camp.</p>
