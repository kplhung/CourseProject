        <p>Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., management consulting firm, is predicting that business travel costs next year will increase by 7 percent -- the biggest such rise it has ever forecast.</p>
        <p>That includes increases of 6.8 percent in air fares, 8 percent in hotel rates, and 10 percent in car rentals and restaurant bills. The reason for the record forecast, Runzheimer said, is ''our belief that inflation, high demand and constrained inventories of seats, rooms and cars will occur simultaneously in late 2000.''</p>

        <p>Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., management consulting firm, is predicting that business travel costs next year will increase by 7 percent -- the biggest such rise it has ever forecast.</p>
        <p>That includes increases of 6.8 percent in air fares, 8 percent in hotel rates, and 10 percent in car rentals and restaurant bills. The reason for the record forecast, Runzheimer said, is ''our belief that inflation, high demand and constrained inventories of seats, rooms and cars will occur simultaneously in late 2000.''</p>
        <p>Overall travel prices held steady through the first five months of this year, however. The AAA's leisure travel index, published on May 30, found that even though air fares were up 6 percent since November 1999, overall costs -- that is, the combined national average for air fares, lodging, food and car rental -- rose only about 1 percent, to $410.60 in May from $406.02 last November. The reason the increase was not higher, the AAA said, is that air fares (which account for 47 percent of the total travel dollar) and car-rental costs were offset by hotel and restaurant costs that remained the same as a year ago.</p>
