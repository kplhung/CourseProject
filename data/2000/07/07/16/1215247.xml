        <p>SOME people watch television to relax, or flip through magazines. Juanita Simmons paints. She owns a two-story house in Queens, and so she has a substantial canvas. Her daughter, she said, fully expects to leave in the morning and come home after work to find that at least one room has changed color.</p>
        <p>Miss Simmons, 49, bought her house on 209th Street in Queens Village 15 years ago from a relative who was leaving the city and moving back to North Carolina. For a while, she picked up tips on making repairs from a neighbor across the street. About a year ago, she attended a home maintenance course offered by Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit agency that helps people of moderate means buy and care for their homes.</p>
        <p>When it ended, she and some other women who had taken the class decided they were fed up with contractors who promise to do things but never show up, or who take their money but never really solve the problem. And so they started the Women's Maintenance Club.</p>
        <p>Every Saturday, the members -- there are three at the moment -- get together to do some work that needs doing, from fixing a roof to tiling a floor to painting a kitchen.</p>
        <p>On a recent Saturday at 6 a.m., when most of the city was still in bed, Miss Simmons and the two other women, Doris Crespo, who owns a house in Jamaica, and Dorothy Morton, who owns a house in St. Albans, were out with their ladders, brushes and paint cans, getting an early start on the day. It was expected to be very, very hot. They were painting the outside of Ms. Morton's two-story house, transforming it from a drab green into the bright emerald that Ms. Morton preferred.</p>
        <p>After a year or so of painting and repairing together, any nervousness the women may have had seemed to have disappeared. Miss Simmons pulled a ladder to the center of the house and confidently sent it nearly to the roofline, so she could paint the metal awnings. She didn't seem fazed by the ladder's wobbling as she headed to the top with her bucket and brush.</p>
        <p>WHEN Ms. Crespo began climbing the bottom rungs so she could reach the part she was painting, Miss Simmons yelled out for her to ''get off my ladder.'' But Miss Simmons didn't  really seem worried. ''As long as I don't look down,'' she said, ''I'm O.K.''</p>
        <p>The women learn as they go. Once, Ms. Morton bought interior paint when she should have bought exterior. They often have to try and try again. ''I painted my bathtub about 10 times,'' Ms. Morton said, ''until I got it right.''</p>
        <p>They are willing to forge ahead without worrying about the right way to do things. ''If we mess up the first time, we don't care,'' Miss Simmons said. If they need help, they usually ask the people at Home Depot for advice. The real secret is in their willingness. ''Most work is tedious and messy,'' Miss Simmons said. ''If you don't mind getting messy, you can do the job.''</p>
        <p>Doing the work themselves saves them money and spares them the aggravation of dealing with people who don't do the job properly. The group tarred the roof of the small building behind Miss Simmons's house after she had spent about $4,000 on various contractors and none had succeeded in fixing the leak. All three women have had that experience. ''Every time I called somebody, they took all my money and did a lousy job,'' Ms. Crespo said.</p>
        <p>Fixing the roof was probably their most ambitious project so far. They tarred about 530 square feet in about three hours. At first, only Miss Simmons was willing to climb up there.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I don't think so, she must be crazy,' '' Ms. Morton said. Finally, though, she went up. ''She's got more nerve than I do,'' Ms. Morton said of Miss Simmons, ''but she helps me to get my nerve together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Crespo went up, but not eagerly. ''I went up there, and I almost stayed there, because I was afraid of coming down,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although they all work hard, Miss Simmons is the cheerleader, the one who really pushes. Which makes sense, because in her spare time, she is an aerobics teacher, giving classes in the small building behind her house.</p>
        <p>Later this month, after 10 years of giving classes at home, she expects to open her own aerobics studio, Body Connection, at 188-20 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans. She bought the building, which has two rentals and a commercial space, for $240,000, with a down payment of $12,000, through the Neighborhood Housing Services program StoreWorks. It works in partnership with the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development to sell city-owned buildings that have storefronts and residential units.</p>
        <p>For the last decade, Miss Simmons has been giving lessons at night. She does that after she finishes her day job at Goldman Sachs, where she is in the communications department, and after she finishes her hour and a half commute. She got into aerobics when she was working two jobs and began eating too much. ''It scared me,'' she said, and so she started running. ''I couldn't run a block at first.''</p>
        <p>In late summer, after her commute, and her workday, and her aerobics lessons, she will often make wine, picking grapes from the vine behind her house. It's something she learned from her father, and in a typical summer, she will make 40 or 50 gallons. Most of it goes to friends. But she keeps a bit around for visitors.</p>
        <p>INSIDE her house, nearly every surface has been transformed by her hand. She has taken down many walls, so instead of the classic Queens house with a lot of little rooms, she has open spaces. She has painted everything, of course, and installed ceiling fans and light fixtures. On one wall, she laid brick and cement, something she learned from her father, Raymond, now retired, who was a mason.</p>
        <p>Tearing out the walls made her daughter, Karen, a social worker, a bit nervous, Miss Simmons said. ''My daughter thought I was crazy,'' she said. ''She thought the house was going to fall in.''</p>
        <p>But Miss Simmons obviously likes creating space. ''I tore down the wall between the living room and the hall with a hammer,'' she said. ''Just think about all that tension, instead of taking it out on someone else.'' The hardest part, she said, was taking out the debris.</p>
        <p>No places appear to be untouched in Miss Simmons's house, although she says she will never be done. If she has no work to do, and she really needs to relax, she will get in her car and drive 10 hours to North Carolina to see her family. ''Driving and painting,'' she said. ''It's a way of releasing tension.''</p>
        <p>Although she seems to be a woman who can do anything, there is one household chore she hates: grocery shopping. ''I shop for three or four months at a time,'' she said. ''I can't bear the thought of going.''</p>
        <p>To avoid shopping trips, she will fill the huge freezer in her kitchen with meat for the grill that will last for months. And, she said, she buys huge bags of rice -- ''anything that will keep me out of the store for three months.''</p>
