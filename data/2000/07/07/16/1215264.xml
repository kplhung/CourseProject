        <p>AT first blush, it seems unfair that a city without an Olmsted Park should have a Balsley Park. Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903), designer of Central Park and Prospect Park, transformed whole swaths of New York. The landscape architect Thomas Balsley (b. 1943) transforms far smaller plots, like the third of an acre on Ninth Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, once known as Sheffield Plaza, that now bears his name.</p>
        <p>But consider this: Sheffield Plaza was a notorious failure as a privately owned public space. Not just hard-edged, it could be downright dangerous. A resident of the Parc Vendome condominium next door was stabbed there. By contrast, Balsley Park -- a greensward, playground and alfresco cafe -- is so welcoming that an official of the Clinton community board and a member of the Parc Vendome board have actually sent thank-you letters to Mr. Balsley and the landlord, Adam R. Rose, who undertook the $1 million renovation.</p>
        <p>Olmsted, look to your laurels.</p>
        <p>The reopening of Sheffield Plaza two weeks ago shows that even the most arid space can be redeemed, given an owner's commitment, public pressure and enough time, money and creativity.</p>
        <p>The changes to this and other neglected plazas underscore the enduring influence  of Jane Jacobs and the late William H. Whyte, who discerned the relation between safety, vitality and variety in urban spaces. But the changes also raise the question of whether the term ''public'' -- as in, ''We want the public to feel comfortable'' -- is sometimes shorthand for ''anyone but the homeless.''</p>
        <p>The transformation of Sheffield Plaza also illustrates a paradox: the improvement of privately owned public space often comes at the price of some diminution in public access. Either the area is closed at night, or a portion of it is given over to a commercial operation. Or both.</p>
        <p>''The goal is to make sure the public is getting something worthwhile in exchange,'' said Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission. ''Most spaces require several efforts to get them functioning optimally.''</p>
        <p>Over the last four decades, bonus plazas and arcades have generated enormous benefits for their builders, roughly 20 million square feet in extra floor area. (Think of it as five World Trade Center towers.)</p>
        <p>They are supposed to reward the public commensurately. When they work, they offer lovely oases in the city's thicket of skyscrapers. When they do not work, however, the developer still gets the use of the bonus floor area while the public is left with a barren patch of pavement. So many spaces have failed to live up to their promise that they are now viewed suspiciously.</p>
        <p>Even the City Planning Department is wary. It has recommended the elimination in the future of all plazas at residential buildings, saying that they ''tend to become privatized'' and are ''frequently inconsistent'' with the physical character of existing neighborhoods. The recommendation is part of a larger rezoning proposal that is now under review.</p>
        <p>Plazas and arcades will come under closer scrutiny this fall with the publication of ''Privately Owned Public Space: The New York City Experience'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons). Written by Jerold S. Kayden of the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, in collaboration with the City Planning Department and Municipal Art Society, it is the first comprehensive analysis of 503 spaces at 320 buildings.</p>
        <p>Typically the most troublesome spaces were built in the 1960's and early 70's, before design standards were imposed.</p>
        <p>Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation inherited such a space two years ago when it bought the Blue Cross Building, 622 Third Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets. The extra floor area attributable to the public space amounts to 137,310 square feet; that is, five of the 39 floors. But a pedestrian coming across the tunnel-like arcade on Third Avenue could have been forgiven for not recognizing it as a benefit.</p>
        <p>''This was a dark and forbidding place,'' said Charles Steven Cohen, president and chief executive of Cohen Brothers, which renamed the tower Grand Central Plaza. Under a $10 million renovation, designed by Thomas Balsley Associates and Moed de Armas &amp; Shannon, the lid has been taken off the arcade, bringing daylight to the 100-foot-long passageway for the first time since its construction 27 years ago.</p>
        <p>Another early plaza now under reconstructive surgery by Mr. Balsley is the sunken courtyard in front of the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza, 767 Fifth Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets. It is being raised 11 feet and turned into a podium with a sculpture garden, above a 22,000-square-foot retail space.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that courtyard hurt the building,'' said Donald J. Trump, who owns the property with Conseco, an insurance company based in Carmel, Ind. The plaza did not hurt the size of the building, however. It added 252,969 square feet of space, or eight of the 50 floors. The plaza renovation will completed by October, Mr. Trump said.</p>
        <p>Some early plazas that have already been renovated are now in need of a second round. Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies are facing that challenge with the space behind their headquarters, 1166 Avenue of the Americas, between 45th and 46th Streets. It was successfully redesigned in 1983 by Hideo Sasaki as International Paper Plaza and remains verdant and popular.</p>
        <p>There is a big problem, however. The plaza is actually a roof deck over the basement. And it leaks. That has prevented the use of the fountain, the meandering waterway and even the sprinklers. It has also occasioned a redesign by William Fellows Architects that would, Mr. Fellows said, ''make a good park better.''</p>
        <p>Seating and plantings would be increased substantially. The fountain would be moved, keeping its centerpiece sculpture, ''Throwback,'' by Tony Smith. The waterway would be eliminated but five dawn redwoods at the north end would remain. This little grove was added as a signature of the International Paper Company, whose headquarters were once in the building.</p>
        <p>The redwood grove also marks the location of a five-story building, 56 West 46th Street, whose owners held out when the Tishman Realty and Construction Corporation was assembling the site for 1166 Avenue of the Americas. Without the midblock property, Tishman could not set its new tower back from the avenue. Instead, it flipped the customary arrangement and put the plaza on the inside. The public space at the base of the building generated a bonus of 242,195 square feet, or six of the 44 floors.</p>
        <p>Four years after the tower was completed in 1974, the holdout was acquired and demolished. Because no basement had been excavated underneath its site, there was room for very large redwood root balls.</p>
        <p>Marsh &amp; McLennan, whose business includes risk and insurance services, investment management and consulting, owns a 70 percent share in the building and occupies roughly that much space. Pending city approval, the renovation would begin next year and be completed by the spring of 2002. The space would be known as MMC Plaza. Marsh &amp; McLennan executives would not put a price tag on the project.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fellows, who is working on the project with Hoffmann Architects and H. M. White, said the original design of the plaza by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill was ''pretty brutal'' -- basically a swath of travertine.</p>
        <p>CONCERNED about the lack of amenities in public plazas, city planners began introducing design standards in the mid-70's. But Mr. Rose, the planning chief, acknowledged that standards do not necessarily guarantee a good plaza, ''if you have an owner that's not committed to making the space work.''</p>
        <p>The city gave itself further leverage five years ago with provisions that allow owners to add kiosks or fences in exchange for improving their plazas. ''Putting a cafe into a space, as long as it's done with the agreement of the public sector, is perfectly legitimate,'' Mr. Rose said. So are nighttime closings, he said, for plazas that have become ''dumping grounds and campsites.''</p>
        <p>The Municipal Art Society supported the idea of nighttime closings, said Ellen P. Ryan, the director of planning issues, since the rationale for the plazas was to ease daytime crowding. ''But there's no question that there's a price to pay,'' she said. ''Has it been worth it? It's too early to tell.''</p>
        <p>Community Board 5 in mid-Manhattan is concerned that such provisions have ''incentivized hardship,'' said its chairman, Kyle Merker. In other words, an owner may let a plaza go to seed and then appeal to the city to save the space by permitting a nighttime closing. ''We don't want to reward bad management of a plaza by giving them the right to take something back from the community, such as hours,'' Mr. Merker said.</p>
        <p>One of the spaces authorized to close at night is currently a bleak cul-de-sac alongside the Ritz Plaza apartment tower, 235 West 48th Street. The 7,173-square-foot space, which generated a 40,143-square-foot bonus, has planters with benches front and back. The back benches make good bunks since they are invisible from the street. Last Monday evening, a shoeless man lay under a cardboard blanket on one bench. Another man claimed a second bench nearby for a nap after growling at a visitor.</p>
        <p>''It's an encampment for the homeless and it's unsafe,'' Mr. Merker said. ''The idea is not to keep homeless out. The idea is to make sure all users of a plaza are using it in the manner for which it was intended. Sit there. Eat lunch. Relax. But if you're living there, it's a problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Balsley has drawn up a plan that would replace the planters with a fountain, add gates and turn the deepest recess into an extension of the adjoining restaurant.</p>
        <p>He said his redesigns are intended to include the ''broadest constituency'' because ''anyone is well behaved in a space that has a balance, a good cross-section.''</p>
        <p>Some of the more intractable plaza problems arise at apartment towers that have been converted to condominium or co-op ownership. ''The developer builds a bonus plaza, sells out and moves on to the next building,'' Mr. Balsley said. ''Now the residents have this bonus plaza. But it's no bonus to them. What they see is a hardship.''</p>
        <p>That was the case at the Harmony co-op, 61 West 62nd Street, whose developer obtained a 95,314-square-foot bonus for what turned out to be a dismal public atrium.</p>
        <p>''The situation is something we inherited, not something we negotiated,'' said Neil S. Goldstein, president of the co-op board. ''Anybody who knew that space had to know it wasn't working.'' In 1996, the storefronts in the atrium were vacant or covered over.</p>
        <p>Then came the ExtraVertical Climbing Center, operated by Ralph Erenzo, with climbing walls up to 50 feet high. Crowds gathered inside and outside to watch the human mountain goats at play. Mr. Goldstein said ExtraVertical had ''added a point of interest, attraction and attention.''</p>
        <p>What would seem on the face of it to be an upbeat ending, however, is clouded by a legal battle. Mr. Erenzo said the failure by the co-op to heat the atrium for three winters in a row seriously damaged his business and hurt his investors, who have not recouped their money. He is seeking damages or an extension of the very favorable initial term of his lease, which called for a rent of merely $100 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erenzo blames the co-op for not acting except under legal threat and the planning and buildings agencies for not enforcing the terms under which public spaces are managed. ''Planning writes the contracts but nobody is checking to see if the owner is doing it,'' he said. ''Buildings doesn't even know what they're supposed to enforce.''</p>
        <p>Despite their dispute, Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Erenzo agreed in separate interviews that the Harmony Atrium seemed finally to be coming to life in its 20th year, thanks to the recent addition of the Rosa Mexicana restaurant and Breadsoul Cafe.</p>
        <p>''We have good, hard-working neighbors now,'' Mr. Erenzo said, ''and the atrium looks like it will be a success.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein said the co-op board was ''committed to making it work'' and had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars toward that end. ''We're on the right track at this point,'' he said. ''We're very optimistic. And I say that notwithstanding the present difficulties with ExtraVertical.''</p>
        <p>Five blocks south, another long-running saga seems to be nearing an end.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, it appears that Sheffield Plaza, at Ninth Avenue and 57th Street, was flawed from the outset. For one thing, the public space does not adjoin the development for which it created a bonus. The 48-story Sheffield apartment tower, 322 West 57th Street, is separated from the Ninth Avenue plaza by the Parc Vendome.</p>
        <p>There is a second plaza at the base of the Sheffield. These two public spaces together yielded a bonus of 183,183 square feet.</p>
        <p>The original developer in the 1970's, Hyman Shapiro, planned to link the Ninth Avenue plaza to the midblock plaza through the central courtyard of the Parc Vendome. But that approach was scrapped by the time the unfinished project was taken over by Rose Associates.</p>
        <p>As designed in 1980 by Abel &amp; Bainson, the Ninth Avenue plaza complied with existing seating, planting and access guidelines. It had a waterfall, planters with flower beds and a small stage surrounded by amphitheater-style seating, where programming was to be staged by WNET-TV, Channel 13, which was then across 57th Street. ''People genuinely believed these were good solutions,'' said Adam Rose, the president of Rose Associates.</p>
        <p>By the mid-80's, the amphitheater was largely unused except as a latrine and dormitory. The waterfall was shut off. The planters, long since empty of flowers, were filled with concrete in an attempt -- not altogether successful -- to discourage rats.</p>
        <p>Jeanne McArthur, a member of the board of managers of the Parc Vendome, said the husband of another board member was stabbed in the plaza early one evening a few years ago. She also recalled a homeless encampment whose residents had gone so far as to hook up a television set.</p>
        <p>''I've never pretended that it was a successful green space that attracted the right kind of people,'' Mr. Rose said. ''But I've been equally insistent that the initial design was done in direct response to specific organizations' and city agencies' requests. The amphitheater was to be filled with cultural programming provided by Channel 13. Never happened. The security function was to be volunteers from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Never happened.''</p>
        <p>The only bright note at Sheffield Plaza was the farmers' market operated every Wednesday and Saturday by the Council on the Environment of New York City, through its Greenmarket program. Rose Associates charges no rent to the market.</p>
        <p>Efforts to renovate the plaza hit an impasse in the 1980's over how, even whether, the plaza could be closed at night and what sort of fence ought to be used. Mr. Rose said the process -- already complicated by the involvement of the Greenmarket, Parc Vendome, block association, community board, borough president, Buildings and Parks Departments -- was further frustrated in the previous administration by city planners who ''kept redesigning the redesign.''</p>
        <p>Enter Mr. Balsley. ''The biggest move I made was a no-brainer,'' he said. ''Put in a cafe at an important corner. You need to anchor the space with a real amenity that will be open all the hours the park is open, managing the tables and chairs, someone you can count on no matter what time of day.'' The operator of the cafe pays no rent.</p>
        <p>The next step was creating a transverse route through the park as a shortcut to lure pedestrians. ''With a large amount of positive traffic walking through,'' Mr. Rose said, ''it deters loiterers of all types.'' To draw even more users, Mr. Balsley added a small, enclosed play area at the south end.</p>
        <p>Perhaps his most audacious move was to replace the sunken amphitheater with a grassy hillock. ''People have an attraction to lawns,'' Mr. Balsley said. ''The idea of a carpet of grass -- there's something magical about it. You don't expect it when you round the corner. The lawn says, 'Come up and lie on me.' '' (It says something else to neighborhood dogs, which is a problem.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose knows the turf will have to be replaced every couple of years. ''I'm willing to bear that cost to have such a beautiful feature,'' he said. ''To be in an urban plaza and see a swath of green is relief in itself.''</p>
        <p>THE plaza has something else it never had before: six-foot-high fences. They retract during the day but are an imposing barrier when they are drawn shut. In winter and fall, the park will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. In spring and summer, it will stay open two hours later. The nighttime closing was approved by the City Planning Commission without the participation of its chairman, Joseph Rose, who is Adam Rose's cousin.</p>
        <p>As far as Ms. McArthur is concerned, ''it's wonderful that it can be closed at night but what I most admire is that the design has brought in children and families.''</p>
        <p>''A place nobody wanted to go is suddenly full of people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Simone Sindin, the chairwoman of the Clinton land-use and zoning committee of Community Board 4, thinks the new park is lovely. ''It's been a lure,'' she said. ''It's been marvelous. People love sitting down there and having a cool drink.''</p>
        <p>Not every review is a rave. The farmers'  market lost its space on 57th Street and did not get its wish for a design that would accommodate trucks on the plaza. Moreover, it had to close from September to March because of the construction. ''For us, the verdict is still out in terms of whether it will bring more clientele,'' said Tony Mannetta, the director of Greenmarket.</p>
        <p>One neighbor is Richard Barth, director of the Manhattan office of the City Planning Department, who walks by the space every day and noted with pleasure how quickly it filled with people after reopening.</p>
        <p>He said the redesign incorporates many lessons learned in the last 40 years: provide constant ''eyes on the street,'' eliminate sharp changes in grade level, offer a variety of seating and create some distinctive feature like the lawn. ''I think it really does function as a park,'' Mr. Barth said.</p>
        <p>To reward Mr. Balsley for his accomplishment and to make up for the many occasions in which the landscape architect received no credit, Adam Rose proposed naming the new park after him, calling him an ''unsung hero'' of public spaces.</p>
        <p>The dutifully modest honoree accepted on behalf of his profession. ''The running joke was that the naming of the park was in lieu of payment of the last invoice,'' Mr. Balsley said. Well, then, did Mr. Rose also pay up? ''Of course he did.''</p>
