        <p>''I'm not asking you to read my lips,'' Vice President Al Gore beseeched the civil-rights conventioneers. ''I'm asking you to read my heart!'' The line brought down the house on Wednesday at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore, where Gov. George W. Bush spoke two days earlier.</p>
        <p>The audience had given Mr. Bush a polite hearing. ''For those of you who support me,'' he said, ''I see a couple here, maybe more than a couple: I hope you won't change your opinion.''</p>

        <p>''I'm not asking you to read my lips,'' Vice President Al Gore beseeched the civil-rights conventioneers. ''I'm asking you to read my heart!'' The line brought down the house on Wednesday at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore, where Gov. George W. Bush spoke two days earlier.</p>
        <p>The audience had given Mr. Bush a polite hearing. ''For those of you who support me,'' he said, ''I see a couple here, maybe more than a couple: I hope you won't change your opinion.''</p>
        <p>The audience reserved their enthusiasm for Mr. Gore, which must have been something of a tonic to the presumptive Democratic nominee. Running neck and neck with or even slightly behind Mr. Bush in recent polls, the vice president needs a strong showing from black voters, who normally support Democrats in overwhelming numbers. Mr. Gore's staff is troubled by surveys showing that support to be less intense than in past campaigns.</p>
        <p>The vice president got another potential lift last week when his bitter primary rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, emerged to give reporters this message: ''I want to make it clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Things, meanwhile, have been going fairly smoothly this summer for Mr. Bush. So smoothly, in fact, that the Republican National Committee felt confident enough to put its television advertising campaign on his behalf on hiatus, even as the Democratic National Committee began running a new spot, on victims' rights, for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Four more days of good news for Mr. Bush are on the horizon: the Republican National Convention begins in two weeks in Philadelphia, though how much the city shares in the potential public relations bonanza remains to be seen. Last week, television viewers across the nation watched the upsetting spectacle of the Philadelphia police beating a man accused of stealing a car and shooting an officer.</p>
        <p>More Americans may have been paying attention to that than to the campaign. In a new poll of 2,174 adults by the Pew Research Center for The People and The Press, only 15 percent said they actively seek news of the presidential race.</p>
