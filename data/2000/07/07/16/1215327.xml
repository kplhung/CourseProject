        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>This situation isn't about race.</p>
        <p>Pollution is pollution, and a civilized person's dilemma seems always to be whether it is worth the risk to bring the offense to the polluter's attention (chances are slim for a civil response).</p>
        <p>The fact that the polluter in this case was black is negligible. That he was big is more to the point. (The prison guard touch is a bonus.) After years of following trash-dumping cars to a red light to talk, confronting subway smokers, etc., I've concluded, astonishingly, that if they look dangerous, they very well might be dangerous!</p>
        <p>So if someone litters, or uses the N-word, or blasts their profane music at our child (in other words, ''pollutes''), we use common sense: approach if they look approachable. Your call on the gauge.</p>
        <p>I'm not minimizing the role race plays in American society. I'm just saying that the role, in this case, is minimal. Unless the  author would have felt more comfortable approaching a big white filth-blasting prison guard. In which case, that's race-ism, and I don't get it.</p>
