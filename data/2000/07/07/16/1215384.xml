        <p>Alison Gardiner Wheeler and Douglas Burbeck Bauer were married yesterday at the Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial, an art gallery in Philadelphia. The Rev. John Rice, a Presbyterian minister, performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bauer, 33, is the program officer for the J. M. Kaplan Fund, a foundation that supports art, culture and parks in New York City. She graduated from the University of Maryland. Her father, the late Dr. Herbert E. Wheeler, was a vice chairman of Furman Selz, an investment firm in New York. Her mother, the late Nancy Wheeler, was a substitute English teacher at Pelham Memorial High School in Pelham Manor, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bauer, 39, is the director of community partnership for SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceutical company in Philadelphia, overseeing its philanthropic activities. He graduated from Michigan State and received a master's degree in journalism from Temple and another in organizational dynamics from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the son of Elizabeth and Mortimer Bauer of Paoli, Pa. His father retired as an assistant vice president for the casualty and property division of Cigna, the insurance company in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The couple started dating in January 1999, after having crossed paths at philanthropic conferences. ''It's really a 'Harry Met Sally' story,'' Mr. Bauer said. ''We'd known each other for years, but then, when there was an opportunity after my divorce, a romance just kind of happened.''</p>
        <p>He proposed the day after Christmas 1999, as they were exchanging presents. In one of the boxes was a diamond ring. ''She was not expecting it all,'' he said. ''She thought for sure she'd be getting a pashmina scarf.''</p>
        <p>He said he liked, ''her agile mind and sharp sense of humor.'' She meanwhile said she was attracted to his passion for things like Indian cooking and discovering unknown nonprofit organizations.</p>
        <p>''In philanthropy, you're always looking around for smart people with good ideas,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ''Part of the reason I'm marrying him is he's a very curious individual, and if you're going to spend your life with someone they've got to be curious. ''</p>
        <p>She added, ''Doug is the kind of person I can always look behind doors with, and under rocks.''</p>
