        <p>LAST week, this column focused on selecting new windows. If you decide to buy one, you will need three measurements before you can place the order: the rough opening, the outside dimensions and the thickness of the wall.</p>
        <p>To find the rough opening, pry off the interior casing then measure the distance between the studs on either side of the window and the distance between the rough sill and the header. Measure the height and width of the frame, i.e., the dimensions of the jamb, to determine the outside dimensions. To find the thickness of the wall, poke a ruler in the gap between the stud and the window frame. Take the measurement from the leading edge of the stud (where the outside sheathing is mounted) to the interior edge of the wallboard. Take these measurements with you when you buy the new window; they will help the dealer to select the ideal size for your opening.</p>

        <p>LAST week, this column focused on selecting new windows. If you decide to buy one, you will need three measurements before you can place the order: the rough opening, the outside dimensions and the thickness of the wall.</p>
        <p>To find the rough opening, pry off the interior casing then measure the distance between the studs on either side of the window and the distance between the rough sill and the header. Measure the height and width of the frame, i.e., the dimensions of the jamb, to determine the outside dimensions. To find the thickness of the wall, poke a ruler in the gap between the stud and the window frame. Take the measurement from the leading edge of the stud (where the outside sheathing is mounted) to the interior edge of the wallboard. Take these measurements with you when you buy the new window; they will help the dealer to select the ideal size for your opening.</p>
        <p>Once you buy a new window, you still have to install it. This is not a particularly difficult task if the size of the replacement is close to the old window. If it is larger, you will have to open up the wall. This will require carpentry skill. If the window is much smaller, you will have to close in the opening. This in itself is not difficult, but you will have to extend the exterior finish to edge of the new window frame without making the repair into an eyesore.</p>
        <p>Before you can install the new window, you will have to remove the old one. From the inside pry off all the window trim, the casings and stop molding, then remove the sashes. Most window frames are held in place with finishing nails that go through the inner and outer casings into the wall studs. When you remove the exterior casing (you already removed the inner when you pulled out the sashes), the window may be loose. If not, check to see if there are any finishing nails that go through the jamb into the studs. Cut these with a hacksaw blade, then pull the frame out.</p>
        <p>Working from the outside, use a stiff putty knife to gentle pry up the siding and insert 30-pound asphalt impregnated building felt under the edges. Start at the bottom and work around the perimeter of the window. Staple the pieces in place as you insert them. The felt will keep moisture from penetrating into the wall.</p>
        <p>Look at the top of the window opening. If there is no drip cap in place, install one. Slide the metal flange of the drip cap under the siding, but do not nail it. When the window is installed, the trim will hold it in place.</p>
        <p>Since the window frame will rest on the sill plate, it is a good idea to check to see if it is level. If it is not, add shims on the low end. Place the window in the opening; you may need a helper to hold it while you insert shims to get the window centered and leveled. From the exterior, measure around the window frame from the jamb to the edge of the siding. Use these figures to measure and cut the exterior trim molding. Remove the window and nail the trim molding to the jambs. Squeeze a bead of caulk around the wall opening in the area that will be covered by the overlapping trim molding.</p>
        <p>Put the window back into the opening and tack it place by driving finishing nails through the trim into the wall. Do not drive the nails home. Leave the heads projecting out so you can remove the nails if necessary to make adjustments. (It is not necessary to nail exterior trim molding to aluminum or vinyl windows because they have nailing flanges attached to the window frame.)</p>
        <p>Use a level and a framing square to check that the window is level, plumb and square. If not, insert shims to correct the alignment. Open and close the window to make sure the sashes operate freely. If they do not, then the frame is probably out of square and needs adjustment.</p>
        <p>When all adjustments are satisfactory secure the window by driving 10d galvanized casing nails, spaced 16 inches apart, through the exterior trim into the wall. Seal the unit by drawing a bead of caulk around the perimeter of the trim.</p>
        <p>Working from the inside, fill the gaps between the jam and studs with fiberglass insulation. Do not pack too much insulation in the gap or it could distort the window frame. Fiberglass insulation can irritate the skin, so wear long sleeves, gloves and dust mask when working with it. Finally, reinstall the old interior trim or cut new pieces to fit.</p>
