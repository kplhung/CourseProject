        <p>EPIC PROPORTIONS.''  ''The Civil War.'' ''The Cripple of Inishmaan.''  ''Capeman.'' One would think a director might want to hide out for a while and recuperate after such a string of flops.</p>
        <p>But the director in question is Jerry Zaks, who not so very long ago also produced a string of hits, including ''Six Degrees of Separation,''  ''The House of Blue Leaves,''  ''Lend Me a Tenor'' and ''Guys and Dolls,'' each of which won him a Tony Award -- not to mention his Tony nominations for ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''  ''Anything Goes'' and ''Smokey Joe's Cafe.''</p>

        <p>EPIC PROPORTIONS.''  ''The Civil War.'' ''The Cripple of Inishmaan.''  ''Capeman.'' One would think a director might want to hide out for a while and recuperate after such a string of flops.</p>
        <p>But the director in question is Jerry Zaks, who not so very long ago also produced a string of hits, including ''Six Degrees of Separation,''  ''The House of Blue Leaves,''  ''Lend Me a Tenor'' and ''Guys and Dolls,'' each of which won him a Tony Award -- not to mention his Tony nominations for ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''  ''Anything Goes'' and ''Smokey Joe's Cafe.''</p>
        <p>And he has been in the business long enough to know that the best way to heal is to keep on working. So, sitting in the cool darkness of the Roundabout Theater Company's newly refurbished American Airlines Theater, where his Broadway production of ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' opens on July 27, Mr. Zaks did not deny that the last few years have been trying ones. But he also seemed anything but defeatist. ''I think you've got to look at the big picture,'' he said. ''I believe my best work is ahead of me.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some would argue that Mr. Zaks has not so much failed his more recent projects as that they have failed him. New comedies, for example, even more than straight plays, are a dying breed on Broadway. In large part because writers have defected to television and movies, producers say good funny material is increasingly hard to come by. And with plays costing $1 million or more to mount, comedies have also become risky business, unless they are pretested London imports.</p>
        <p>''Producers are afraid,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters. ''They see enough of them fail.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the few American comedies that have made it to Broadway lately have died quick deaths, namely last season's ''Wrong Mountain'' by David Hirson and ''Taller Than a Dwarf'' by Elaine May. In the 1998-99 season there was Rob Bartlett's ''More to Love: A Big Fat Comedy.'' It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Emanuel Azenberg, a longtime producer of Neil Simon's work on Broadway, said that writing funny is harder than it used to be, that Jewish humor and African-American humor are no longer novel and that the comic writers of the 1930's and 1940's have not been replaced. ''I don't know what's funny about society now,'' Mr. Azenberg said. ''A good comedy is not jokes, it's organic situations.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Zaks, 53, is reluctant to blame the material, it is clear that the pool of potential projects is not as deep as it once was. ''I read fewer and fewer scripts that make me laugh out loud,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Zaks pointed out, experience coupled with success breeds a kind of hubris, the kind that makes a director feel as if he can triumph, whatever the obstacles. ''Because you are confident in your skills as a director, you think you can make anything work,'' he said. ''And learning that is not the case when the material doesn't support it is a hard lesson.''</p>
        <p>Why venture into problematic material at all? Mr. Zaks said that if he had known it was problematic, he wouldn't have done it in the first place. ''That's like saying you shouldn't have fallen in love with someone,'' he said. ''It's not rational. It's an emotional response.''</p>
        <p>The director said he had had that emotional response to ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' the 1939 comedy by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, after directing a reading of it about three years ago for the Roundabout, which then decided to mount a full-fledged production in its new theater on 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>The show stars Nathan Lane -- who also did the reading -- as Sheridan Whiteside, a curmudgeonly New York writer and critic based on Alexander Woollcott, who fractures his hip on the front steps of a well-to-do family's Ohio home and torments its occupants during his recuperative stay. Monty Woolley originated the role on Broadway, where the play ran for 21 months and was subsequently made into a movie.</p>
        <p>The cast of the current production also includes Jean Smart, Stephen DeRosa, Byron Jennings, Lewis J. Stadlen and Julie Halston, all of whom inhabit the luxurious living room set designed by Tony Walton that pays tribute to the Roundabout's elegant surroundings, the renovated Selwyn Theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaks said he had refused to do the show without Mr. Lane, whom he had directed in ''Guys and Dolls,'' ''Laughter on the 23d Floor,''  ''A Funny Thing'' and a reading of Stephen Sondheim's musical ''Assassins.''</p>
        <p>The two men both said they had enjoyed creating Whiteside. ''Nathan and I talk a lot about how much does the character need at any given moment to dispatch the people he's irritated by,'' Mr. Zaks said. ''Does he need a BB gun? Does he need a bazooka? And modulating that is important, lest he come across as just mean.''</p>
        <p>It is this kind of thinking through of a play that seems to animate and sustain Mr. Zaks, whom colleagues describe as hard to get to know. He takes obvious pride and comfort in perfecting a production's theatrical details: how speeding up the delivery of a line can suddenly make it funny; how a nail file might prove to be a comic piece of business; how closing a door at the wrong moment can kill a laugh. For Mr. Zaks, it seems, the work itself is a refuge -- safe and solid ground, the place where he calls the shots and feels secure in his own capacity to make things right with the world.</p>
        <p>T HIS production is the sum of thousands of little moments we have investigated, played with and orchestrated,'' Mr. Zaks said. ''There's no way to describe the joy I feel in the back of the house when the audience is having a great time. Aside from my kids, it's my greatest pride.''</p>
        <p>In talking about how he directs, Mr. Zaks keeps mentioning trust as paramount -- how his collaboration with Mr. Lane is strong because the actor has faith in him. ''I depend upon the kindness of playwrights, I also depend on the brilliance of really good actors,'' Mr. Zaks said. ''An actor like Nathan, who's got his craft right at his fingertips, he trusts me to suggest and shape and observe. You feel kind of unlimited potential when you have that connection.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaks's guardedness and his emphasis on trust seem to resonate with his background. Born in Stuttgart, Germany, he is the son of Holocaust survivors. His mother, Lily, was liberated at Auschwitz; his father, Sy, a kosher butcher, escaped the Nazis by masquerading as a Gentile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaks was brought up in Paterson, N.J., and planned on becoming a doctor. But after taking a date to see a Dartmouth production of ''Wonderful Town'' in his sophomore year at the college, he was hooked and dropped his pre-med classes. A heavy young man, he went on a diet and regularly closed himself in a studio to dance to musicals like ''Hello, Dolly!'' until he was exhausted. He lost 40 pounds.</p>
        <p>After earning an M.F.A. at Smith College, Mr. Zaks started acting in New York with the Ensemble Studio Theater. He supported himself with commercials and jobs in children's theater -- playing young versions of Thomas Edison, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin. His first directing project was ''The Soft Touch,'' by Neil Cuthbert in the mid-1970's. ''I stood in the back and fell in love with directing,'' Mr. Zaks said. ''All of a sudden, I was getting a different satisfaction than I got as an actor, but of the same magnitude. It felt so good.''</p>
        <p>HE would have success with the early Christopher Durang comedy, ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' and would go on to direct Mr. Durang's ''Marriage of Bette and Boo,''  ''Baby With the Bath water'' and ''Beyond Therapy.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, he directed ''The House of Blue Leaves,'' the first in a series of well-received productions for Lincoln Center Theater, including ''Six Degrees of Separation,''  ''The Front Page'' and ''Anything Goes.''  ''He was responsible for the liftoff of this theater from a standstill,'' said Bernard Gersten, executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater. ''So my regard for Jerry and his talents is boundless.''</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, perhaps, these early hits made Mr. Zaks a tough act even for him to follow. ''When you have a burst of success initially, they're all waiting and praying for you to fail,'' Mr. Lane said. ''It's hard to keep that up, and eventually something is not going to work.</p>
        <p>''People say things -- nasty, nasty things -- and no matter how successful you've been or how confident people think you are, it hurts. It's just the nature of show business. It has its ups and downs. People love you for a little and then they turn on you.''</p>
        <p>Still, some might question why Mr. Zaks turned his energies toward ''The Civil War,'' Frank Wildhorn's song cycle, or ''Epic Proportions,'' Larry Coen and David Crane's comedy about making a ''Ten Commandments''-style movie in the 1930's -- both of which closed on Broadway because of lack of business. Or, they might ask, why did Mr. Zaks decide to come in as a ''production supervisor'' on last season's Broadway revue ''Swing!'' -- which was directed and choreographed by Lynne Taylor-Corbett -- as well as try to rescue Paul Simon's ''Capeman'' in 1998, for which he was uncredited in the show's program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landesman said that if Mr. Zaks had consulted him before taking on ''Epic Proportions,'' he would have advised against it. ''I would have asked, 'Is this a good enough play to bring out the best of what you can do?' '' Mr. Landesman said.</p>
        <p>Others believe that Mr. Zaks's work on ''Swing!'' -- a revue like the longrunning ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,'' which Mr. Zaks directed in 1995 -- as a ''production supervisor'' is the equivalent of script-doctoring in the movies and unworthy of Mr. Zaks's considerable skills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaks responds that ''Epic Proportions'' made him laugh and that ''The Civil War'' -- which was overseen by Gregory Boyd at the Alley Theater in Houston before Mr. Zaks took it on -- offered an opportunity to do a show about an important subject. ''Swing!,'' he said, was a challenge in terms of creating a unified whole out of several disparate musical pieces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landesman, who about 10 years ago gave Mr. Zaks an annual salary and an office in exchange for getting first crack at his projects, said he would like to see Mr. Zaks originate more material -- even though ''Smokey Joe's Cafe,''  ''The Civil War'' and ''Swing!'' were all Jujamcyn shows. But he said he still believed that Mr. Zaks was the best Broadway had to offer. ''There are more hits still in him,'' Mr. Landesman said. ''I have total confidence in the guy.''</p>
        <p>When asked what lessons he drew from his recent directing experiences, Mr. Zaks demurred. ''It's painful, it's personal and it's private,'' he said. ''I try not to live there too long.''</p>
        <p>But, he continued: ''The work itself is no less fulfilling. Obviously, I would prefer that something have a healthy and long run. If it doesn't, it's because not enough people wanted to see it.''</p>
        <p>Although he has been bitter about reviews and sometimes surprised by them, Mr. Zaks said he did not hold critics responsible for a show's ultimate demise. While his production of Larry Shue's farce ''The Foreigner'' Off Broadway in the mid-1980's, for instance, was largely dismissed, it ran for about three years on the strength of word of mouth.</p>
        <p>''A negative review never helps, but I don't think it's the difference between something running and not running,'' Mr. Zaks said. ''I take pride in it all. I always hope that it's good enough that someone will leave the theater and tell someone, 'You have to see this.' ''</p>
        <p>AT the same time, Mr. Zaks speaks of ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' as if it belongs in another category, as if he is grateful for a return to quality. ''I'd forgotten how good it feels to be presiding over material as special as I think this is,'' he said. ''Sitting through this is something I look forward to and it's been a while since I felt that.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Lane said the project clearly agrees with his friend. ''I've never seen Jerry this happy, this relaxed,'' he said. ''Hopefully, it's a tribute to the work we've been doing and his own maturity. I've never seen him quite like this before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaks said he had been going through a tough time in his private life because his wife had been ill and that ''personal life has an impact on the work.'' They have two daughters -- 12 and 18. Mr. Zaks met his wife, Jill Rose, a former dancer, while on a national tour of ''Grease'' during Mr. Zaks's acting days -- he played Kenickie, she played Frenchie.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Zaks worries about what he could have done to make certain shows better, he does not seem to obsess about whether various misfires might damage his reputation in the long run. ''The people who put on shows know what I do,'' he said. ''And they haven't seemed any more reluctant to have me do what I do because a couple of shows haven't worked at the box office.''</p>
        <p>''Professionally and personally, things couldn't be better,'' he said. ''It's showtime.''</p>
