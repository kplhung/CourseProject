        <p>NORMAL GIRL</p>
        <p>By Molly Jong-Fast.</p>
        <p>195 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Villard. $21.95.</p>
        <p>''There may be something meaningful to say about rehabs, about the culture of them, about the kind of people who spend their whole lives in and out of them, but I couldn't tell you what that is,'' Molly Jong-Fast writes in her autobiographically inspired first novel about life in the fast lane of Park Avenue Jewry.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Jong-Fast, the 21-year-old daughter of Erica Jong and Jonathan Fast, doesn't have anything particularly meaningful to say about people or culture beyond the scope of rehab either. Not that we don't feel Jong-Fast's pain when her self-destructive alter ego, Miranda Woke, a part-time gallery assistant whose filthy rich parents don't show her enough love, is found foaming at the mouth at 4 a.m.</p>
        <p>on a SoHo sidewalk after an overzealous coke binge (with a little smack and Wild Turkey thrown in for good cheer). But this terrain has already been well trampled 15 years ago, and with no shortage of panache, by Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis. Moreover, Jong-Fast expends so much energy trying to sound wise beyond her years -- a large percentage of her sentences seem to be lacking only the word ''darling'' -- that whatever original perspective she might have lent to the story gets lost in the shuffle.</p>
        <p>Not to mention the tireless pronouncements. ''Funerals are the cotillions of the 90's, where the young people meet and mingle,'' Jong-Fast writes, presumably with sleepy lids and a cigarette dangling out the side of her mouth. And ''Being a drug addict trumps being a socialite any day.'' And ''Children of famous people are like Communism -- better in concept than in practice.'' And ''Dosage has never been my forte.'' And ''Smoking heroin after snorting coke is a bit like having a Tasti-D-Lite on the way home from the gym.'' And my personal favorite: ''Art -- what a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Jong-Fast's fondness for put-downs infuses her descriptive powers to more felicitous -- and occasionally hilarious -- effect. One overtanned socialite is described as ''more handbag than woman''; another character is stamped with the moniker ''everyone's favorite bipolar personal shopper.'' Even the United Airlines first-class lounge takes a drubbing; Jong-Fast describes it as being ''decorated with bowls of salty hepatitis peanuts and pretzels.'' Still, such bursts of comic fortitude aren't enough to carry a novel so flimsy in content. There is a dim outline of a plot having to do with whether or not Miranda killed her heroin-addicted boyfriend, Jeff. But since the reader never learns a single detail about his and Miranda's relationship, the dramatic tension is nonexistent.</p>
        <p>''Normal Girl'' shows signs of turning into a coherent novel, complete with viable characters and telling details, upon Miranda's retreat to Minnesota (a k a Minne-sober) for a lifestyle overhaul. With a nod to Susanna Kaysen's ''Girl, Interrupted,'' Jong-Fast packs the room with patients who are sardonic princesses (Miranda included) and battle-ax nurses who won't allow shoelaces on the premises. But Jong-Fast can't stop the quipping and cracking -- Detox conversations are like the first half of a daytime soap opera or the end of a dinner party, when everybody's run out of stories'' -- long enough to probe the folly of addiction. Instead, the reader is left to make sense of such cringe-making attempts at profundity as ''My dull universe is the place where self-loathing blends with sitcoms, and dullness like Vaseline coats everything I see.''</p>
        <p>The irony of ''Normal Girl'' is that the only explanation provided for Miranda's malaise has to do with her being a child of privilege. And yet, if Miranda's real-life inspiration, Molly Jong-Fast, weren't the daughter of a famous novelist (or two), it seems doubtful that this book would have found a publisher -- suggesting that being a non-normal girl isn't such a terrible thing after all.</p>
        <p>Lucinda Rosenfeld's first novel, ''What She Saw in Roger Mancuso, Gnter Hopstock, Jason Barry Gold . . .'' will be published in September.</p>
