        <p>By June Jordan.</p>

        <p>Some months before the black poet June Jordan was born, she writes, her mother was visited in a dream by angels who told her the child would grow up to help the ''colored people.'' But as Jordan's memoir, ''Soldier,'' makes clear, an activist is not born but made. Jordan learned both to love the written word and to resent injustice in the person of her father, Granville. A West Indian immigrant who taught himself to read, he directed his considerable intelligence and rage into making his daughter fit for white society. This included trips to Manhattan museums and Carnegie Hall, strictly enforced reading assignments and, ultimately, enrollment of an unenthusiastic June into an elite all-white boarding school. Then there was a darker curriculum: drills in combat skills, literature lessons that descended into violence and unpredictable nighttime visits when he would return from his late shift at the post office, pull his ''black devil child'' from bed and beat her until his fury and frustration were spent. Jordan's mother, helpless against her husband's determination to turn their daughter into the son he never had, retreated into chilly passivity and her prayer book, leaving June to challenge him. By the time she was 7, the girl was keeping a knife under her pillow. Shortly before her eighth birthday she pulled it on him. The random beatings soon ceased. ''Soldier'' never falls into score-settling, in large part because the adult Jordan is not merely looking back on her childhood. Rather she attempts to reinhabit it, conjuring the helpless love and awe a towering parent inspires in every child. Her memoir makes vivid the debt she owes to the father who both nurtured and tormented her.</p>
