        <p>At a time when polls show Vice President Al Gore trailing his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, in several battleground states, an increasing number of Democrats contend that President Clinton should play a prominent role stumping for Mr. Gore this fall -- even if it reminds voters that he, and not his protege, remains the party's pre-eminent performer.</p>
        <p>In closely contested states from Washington to Missouri to New Jersey, state Democratic leaders and strategists say Mr. Clinton could bring much needed charisma and excitement to a campaign that has often seemed leaden and uninspiring, even to many of its allies.</p>
        <p>More important, those Democratic leaders say, Mr. Clinton is still revered by important Democratic constituencies, particularly black voters. Several recent polls suggest that a substantial number of those core Democrats seem either disengaged from the contest or disenchanted with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Rather than having Mr. Clinton fade into the sunset after the national convention, a la Ronald Reagan in 1988 or Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1960, these Democrats want the president to play a lead role in the party's vital get-out-the-vote efforts leading to Election Day.</p>
        <p>''I think Bill Clinton could carry this state for Al Gore,'' said Jim Edmunson, the chairman of the Oregon Democratic Party, a traditionally strong Democratic state where a recent poll shows Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush of Texas. ''My counsel would be to use the president wherever and as often as they can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's role in the postconvention campaign is the subject of discussions between White House officials and aides to Mr. Gore, including William M. Daley, the campaign chairman. Both sides say Mr. Clinton has made it clear that he will bow to Mr. Gore's judgment on how he should be involved in the race, a decision the vice president is not expected to make until after the convention.</p>
        <p>But the pressure to use Mr. Clinton has placed the Gore campaign in a bind. The vice president's advisers acknowledge that Mr. Clinton's artful touch with a crowd could energize Democratic voters for Mr. Gore. But they worry that the president will outshine Mr. Gore on the trail, making the nominee seem more like the campaign's understudy than its star.</p>
        <p>For that very reason, the Democrats have scheduled Mr. Clinton to address the Democratic National Convention on its first evening next month, thereby leaving the spotlight to Mr. Gore for the next three nights. Most Democrats view the convention as the moment when Mr. Gore must step decisively out of Mr. Clinton's shadow and stake his claim as the party's undisputed chief.</p>
        <p>''One of Gore's real deficits, in terms of public image, is the leadership question,'' said a Democratic strategist who informally advises the Gore campaign. ''Curing that is more important than using Clinton's magic with the base. The question is, would Clinton's efforts in the fall undermine Gore's leadership image? It's a delicate question that can't be answered yet.''</p>
        <p>Already an array of assignments for the first campaigner is being considered. At a minimum, Mr. Clinton would continue fund-raising for  Democratic candidates. He might also be asked to address core Democratic groups, like abortion rights advocates and black voters. At the other end of the scale, he might campaign extensively in closely contested states where he remains popular, including Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>
        <p>But the Gore campaign is likely to resist having the two men campaign side by side. Some of Mr. Gore's advisers would prefer that Mr. Clinton play a relatively minimal part in the postconvention campaign, similar to President Reagan's role in George Bush's 1988 campaign. Mr. Clinton, however, has made clear that he would like to do more.</p>
        <p>While the Gore campaign clearly wants to keep its options open for the president, Democratic leaders in many of those battleground states have not been shy about voicing their opinions to the Gore campaign and to Mr. Clinton himself: they would like to see the president campaigning early and often on their home turf.</p>
        <p>''There's no one like the president who can communicate to voters,'' said Paul Berendt, chairman of the Washington State Democratic Party. ''I think he's the secret weapon of the Gore effort.''</p>
        <p>Terri Spring, chairwoman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, said: ''I would welcome him to Wisconsin. He has done wonderful things for the country. No American can deny that America is better off now than eight years ago. And it's because of President Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Thomas P. Giblin, chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party, said Mr. Clinton remained very popular in that state, where several polls have shown the race very close. Though he acknowledged that using Mr. Clinton extensively ''might be viewed as a dicey move,'' he argued that the president's popularity with core Democrats and even some independents would outweigh any risks he might pose.</p>
        <p>''He might be the person it takes to activate people,'' Mr. Giblin said. ''They seem to respond better to Bill Clinton than to Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giblin's remarks underscore a concern usually expressed privately by Democrats: that Mr. Gore is not connecting emotionally with Democrats as well as Mr. Bush is with Republicans.</p>
        <p>Several recent polls seem to confirm that worry. A Gallup survey in late June showed 75 percent of Democrats supporting Mr. Gore, compared with 91 percent of Republicans saying they would vote for Mr. Bush. And a poll released on Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press shows that Republican support for Mr. Bush is more intense than Democratic support for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Democrats discount such early polls, arguing that their core voters historically become interested in campaigns later than Republicans. Once those Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents become focused on the contest, they will quickly unite behind the vice president, Mr. Gore's allies assert.</p>
        <p>But many of those same Democrats also say Mr. Gore has suffered from the widespread perception, fair or not, that he is not particularly warm, engaging or likable.</p>
        <p>''After Bill Clinton, I think anyone would seem to face a letdown in terms of enthusiasm,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat from New York. ''Clinton has been electric among the minority community. Gore, unless he is turned on, can be stiff and awkward.''</p>
        <p>Though warm-and-fuzzy biographical commercials for Mr. Gore and a feel-good Democratic convention could help him in the personality contest, many Democrats say they are also counting on Mr. Clinton to transfer some of his popularity to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''He can use his charm to get people to listen,'' said Roy Temple, executive director of the Democratic Party in Missouri, where a recent poll shows Mr. Bush leading Mr. Gore. And when he gets them to listen, he can say, ''Who do you want to lead the country?''</p>
        <p>''Al Gore doesn't have to have Bill Clinton campaigning to win,'' he added. ''But if you've got a resource like that, you use it to the fullest extent possible.''</p>
        <p>Asked if they were worried that Mr. Clinton would overshadow Mr. Gore on the stump, most of the Democratic leaders said no. Voters, they argued, would learn to accept the vice president for who he was once they focused on the campaign.</p>
        <p>''Charisma doesn't necessarily carry the day,'' said Ms. Spring, the Wisconsin party chairwoman. ''Charisma may have gotten President Clinton into some problems. The American people will be looking at who can do the job. It's not who you want as your fishing buddy, but who is competent.''</p>
        <p>But some Democrats argue that Mr. Clinton will bring too much troublesome baggage to the campaign. They assert, for example, that liberal Democrats who are disenchanted with administration policies on health care, the environment and trade, and consequently leaning toward Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, are unlikely to change their minds because of Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Clinton helps among the traditional liberals,'' said Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group that has endorsed Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>And some political analysts contend that Mr. Clinton could provide a constant reminder of impeachment, Monica S. Lewinsky and campaign finance abuses that could drive conservative Democrats and independent voters into the arms of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''My belief is, they've always wanted to punish Bill Clinton somehow, and they are going to do that by punishing Al Gore,'' said Ed Sarpolus, a Michigan-based pollster whose most recent survey shows Mr. Bush with a 12-point lead in Michigan. ''Until Gore separates himself, he'll be in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders say they are less worried about those issues than about Mr. Clinton's irrepressible fondness for the campaign, which, they say, could make him difficult to control. Once unleashed, will he follow the Gore script? Will he be willing to sing in the chorus and not interrupt the vice president's solos?</p>
        <p>''He is a racehorse and when the elections roll around, he's eager to get out on the track,'' said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who talks to both the White House and the Gore campaign. ''But it will be Gore's call. I think Clinton wants to do what is best.''</p>
