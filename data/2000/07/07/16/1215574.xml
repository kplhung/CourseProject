        <p>COLEMAN-Thomas A. The CoSponsors, the Board of Trustees, Medical Staff, and the Administration of Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York, note with deep sadness the death of our longtime friend and dedicated benefactor, Thomas A. Coleman, who served as Chairman of Saint Vincents Hospital and Medical Center's Board of Trustees. Mr. Coleman was a member of Saint Vincents Hospital's Board of Trustees since 1976 and was actively involved in both the Finance and Development Committees. He served with distinction as Chairman of the Board beginning in 1992. He was also a member of the newly formed Manhattan/ Westchester Regional Board of Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York. Through his many years of dedication, Mr. Coleman provided advisory assistance to past presidents of the Hospital, and was instrumental in building the Hospital's endowment and ensuring its fiscal stability. In 1988, Mr. Coleman was the first recipient of the Hospital's ''Angelus Award'' which is presented annually to an individual who has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to excellence in healthcare and whose volunteer efforts further the mission of Saint Vincents Hospital. Mr. Coleman set the precedent and standard for this award. He was a tireless fundraiser who not only personally supported the Hospital, but also through countless volunteer hours, attracted major donations from corporations, foundations and private individuals. A proponent of the Hospital research and clinical education programs, he underwrote a number of the Hospital's programs including the Pulmonary Medicine Fellowship in the Department of Medicine. His deep commitment to the Archdiocese of New York and the Sisters of Charity was manifested by his role as a Trustee of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, the College of Mount St. Vincent and the New York Foundling Hospital. He was also dedicated to his alma mater, the University of Notre Dame where he served as a member of the Board of Trustees. As a respected philanthropic leader, citizen and humanitarian who personified the spirit and highest ideals of our system, words could never convey the sadness that the Saint Vincents' family feels at this time. We extend our deepest condolences to his sister Mary Ann Hagerty and his entire family. David J. Campbell, President/ CEO, Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York Most Reverend Joseph M. Sullivan, Co-Chair, Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York Elizabeth A. Vermaelen, S.C., Co-Chair, Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers of New York</p>
