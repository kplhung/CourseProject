        <p>Damita's Day</p>
        <p>Home: Damita Holbrook, 31, lives in Decatur, an almost all-black neighborhood, less than 15 miles from the office. ''I didn't think about race when I thought about where to live. The house was close to my church, my godsister and my job downtown. Other than that, I'm not sure why people choose to live where they do.'' Saturday morning: Damita takes tennis lessons 10 minutes from her house. Her class is all black, but ''it's just because of the proximity of the neighborhood.'' Saturday afternoon: Damita shops at Parisian's, a department store whose customers she figures are about half black, half white. Whether Damita is moving in an integrated world or not ''depends on what I'm doing. For the most part, my work is mixed -- the mall is definitely mixed and I'm taking a public speaking class that is mixed. But my church is predomin-antly black, and my marathon training is mostly white.'' Sunday morning: Damita attends a Baptist church, but feels ''it's important that people intermingle. You can learn a lot from different people.'' Race? ''It's there,'' she says. ''It's not necessarily something I think about on a constant basis. You're aware of it, but you don't dwell on it.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca's Day</p>
        <p>Home: Rebecca Breedlove, 50, lives 30 miles from her office in Marietta, a mostly white neighborhood. Saturday morning: Rebecca visits Rich's Department Store, where the University of Georgia's football coach is signing memorabilia. ''What separates Damita and me? Probably our activities. Damita is very athletic, but I'm a fan. I don't think we have major ideological differences. We both like to do Martha Stewart kind of stuff.'' Saturday afternoon: Rebecca shops at a local collectibles store. ''It was only when it was pointed out to me that I thought, Oh, my gosh, I guess I live in a white world. I'm old enough to remember a segregated world, and I really thought mine was much more integrated than it is.'' Sunday morning: Rebecca attends a primarily white Presbyterian church. She and Damita, she says, ''share the same values, integrity, a strong work ethic, strong religious faith, closeness to family. If I were to say what's the biggest difference between Damita and me, it's our age difference -- I'm old enough to be her mother.''</p>
