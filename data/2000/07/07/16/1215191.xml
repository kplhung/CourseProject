        <p>IN a throwback to the early years of the 20th century when wealthy Chicago families tended to live in such close-in neighborhoods as Prairie Avenue and the Gold Coast, the city's Lincoln Park area is experiencing a boom in mansion construction.</p>
        <p>In the last five years, the neighborhood, about a mile and a half north of the Loop, has seen construction of dozens of examples of the kind of house that had not been built in any great number in the inner city in many years. They are palatial residences of at least 6,000 square feet w that start at around $2.5 million and go much higher.</p>
        <p>The number of such houses, like the official definition of what constitutes a mansion, is difficult to ascertain. Most people seem to know one when they see one, however. And the evidence of a dramatic change in the neighborhood's fortunes is clear from a walk down any of the long blocks of Howe or Mohawk or Burling Streets just north of Old Town.</p>
        <p>Looming over the remaining original housing -- mainly modestly scaled clapboard cottages and brick three-flats that date from just after the Chicago fire in 1871 -- are the elaborate limestone facades of dozens of new three-  and four-story houses.</p>
        <p>Who is buying them? Real estate agents and builders say the main clients are couples and families in their mid-30's and early 40's who have struck it rich in the booming economy of the last decade and are choosing to stay in the city rather than move to the suburbs.</p>
        <p>''This is the new wave,'' said Sean Conlon, director of sales and marketing for Sussex &amp; Reilly, a leading North Side residential brokerage firm. ''The last people to build houses this big downtown were the great industrialists and robber barons of the 1890's. But they built over on the Gold Coast. A new neighborhood is emerging here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conlon, 31, recently moved into a new four-story, 6,000-square-foot house on Mohawk Street with a slate mansard roof, arched windows and lavish detailing. ''They had homes like this in Paris and London in the 1700's and 1800's,'' he said. ''It's an exquisite, timeless style.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conlon's house is typical of the prevailing look of the new houses. The style, which leans heavily toward limestone columns, balustrades and elaborate fruit and flower friezework, is usually described as Georgian or Classical or Beaux-Arts.</p>
        <p>In some ways, it is an unlikely look for Chicago area, the birthplace of modern architecture and the home of such modernist giants as Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe.</p>
        <p>''They look like banks,'' said one top real estate agent. who requested anonymity.</p>
        <p>John Vinci of Vinci/Hamp Architects, a firm much noted locally for historic renovation work, calls them fantasy houses. ''They're emulations of turn-of-the-century Parisian or Belgian grand houses,'' he said. ''It's just fantasy to build these houses now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vinci is also the architect -- along with the late Max Gordon, a British architect -- of the house that many say was the beginning of the whole downtown mansion trend. Nine years ago, Lewis Manilow, a local investor and chairman of President Clinton's Illinois fund-raising committee, went looking for what he called ''a country house in the city.'' When he could not find one, he decided to build a new house on four adjoining lots he had acquired on Howe Street.</p>
        <p>Howe Street at that time, Mr. Vinci said, was ''a street of small houses'' in a neighborhood that had been steadily gentrifying since the 1970's but that had yet to see much new construction.</p>
        <p>The house Mr. Vinci designed is a modern, 10,000-square-foot tan brick structure with a sizable garden.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to consolidate my life,'' Mr. Manilow said. ''I used to have a condo as well as a loft where I had my office and part of my art collection. Now everything is in one place.''</p>
        <p>Why Lincoln Park? ''It's very urban,''  Mr. Manilow said. ''You can walk downtown, to the lake, the park. There's lots of people on the street. It's just a very friendly neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Another consideration is the availability of land for construction, free of landmark-district constraints. Traditionally, the wealthy in Chicago have lived on the Gold Coast, a roughly 12-square-block area that includes Lake Shore Drive and Astor Street and is just south and east of Lincoln Park.</p>
        <p>DEVELOPED around the turn of the century, the housing is a mix of mainly co-op apartment buildings and historic mansions and row houses, many of which are official landmarks.</p>
        <p>''There's only 80-some single-family houses on the Gold Coast,'' said James M. Kinney, president of Rubloff Residential Properties, a leading downtown residential brokerage. ''And you have to get neighborhood approval to tear anything down. Lincoln Park, however, aside from a few areas, isn't landmarked. You can build what you want.''</p>
        <p>Which is exactly what is happening. ''I get calls every day from people who are looking to build in the neighborhood,'' said Elizabeth Ballis, a saleswoman with Coldwell Banker's Lincoln Park office.</p>
        <p>The new houses are a mix of build-to-suits and speculative ventures by half a dozen  custom builders. The two most influential are the Metzler Hull Development Corporation and the BGD&amp;C Corporation. Both are local companies that build four or five houses a year. The houses generally take 12 to 14 months to complete.</p>
        <p>According to Jay Metzler, one of the principals of Metzler Hull, the process begins with finding land, something that has become more difficult in the last few years. Single 25-foot-by-125-foot lots now sell for up to $700,000 or $800,000 and the ideal is two or more contiguous lots.</p>
        <p>''We're building a $2.8 million spec house right now on a single lot and the land is a quarter of the price,'' Mr. Metzler said. ''We like doing specs. They give us a chance to exercise our creativity. We've done 12 to 15 of them over the last few years and all but one sold well before they were finished.''</p>
        <p>BOTH companies stress that what sells  are luxurious details and craftsmanship. ''We spend a lot of time in Europe researching moldings, door designs and other features that people seem to have gotten away from over here,'' said Charles Grode, vice president of BGD&amp;C. He added that the company recently built an 8,500-square-foot Venetian-style home on a double lot on Burling Street that is authentic ''right down to the chimney caps.'' The roof, he added, is made of ''100-year-old clay tiles from a building in Philadelphia.''</p>
        <p>His customers ''want the details to be rich,'' Mr. Metzler said. This means, as a matter of course, mahogany paneling and window frames throughout, marble and oak floors, grand curving staircases and -- in some houses -- 20-  and 25-foot-high ceilings.</p>
        <p>How do they differ from the grand houses of the past? ''They don't have ballrooms,'' said Mr. Vinci, the architect.</p>
        <p>What they do have, however, are children. Both companies say that children's rooms and activities have a new prominence in most of their houses. Mr. Metzler said he was building a roller-hockey rink in the basement of one house and was planning a basketball court in the basement of another. The basketball court alone, he said, will add more than $200,000 to the cost of the house.</p>
        <p>''This is an absolute dream house,'' said Elizabeth Saltzman, who along with her husband, Richard, the owner of Banner Wholesale Grocers, recently bought a Metzler Hull house. ''We looked at some older houses, but we have four kids and it can be tough to find that many bedrooms in an older house.</p>
        <p>''There's a very welcoming feeling here. People sit on their porches and stoops. The kids have a certain freedom that they probably wouldn't have in other neighborhoods. They can walk to the park and do things by themselves.''</p>
        <p>Her verdict? ''As long as we can afford it, we're staying.''</p>
