        <p>Given the total seclusion of the Camp David peace talks, photographs issued by the White House offer the only glimpse inside the presidential retreat. They present frozen images of men in shirtsleeves, pens poised over note pads, their faces absorbed in thought.</p>
        <p>While it is impossible to know what is going on at those negotiating tables, the delegations themselves offer a road map to the process. Israelis, Palestinians and Americans, their political, military and diplomatic careers have been interwoven and, in some cases, steered exclusively toward this goal: the supposed endgame of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and the resolution of 52 years of conflict.</p>
        <p>For the three members of the American peace team, for instance, this summit meeting marks the culmination of a professional life spent shuttling between Israelis and Arabs, a career that became a personal mission.</p>
        <p>In negotiations that will surely go right to the wire, and then trip it, everything will eventually come down to the leaders themselves. But the fabric of relations is knitted by the negotiators, by, say, the interaction between Shlomo Ben-Ami, the popular Labor Party politician who is a potential future challenger to Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, and Abu Ala, the Palestinian parliament speaker, who is a potential future heir to Yasir Arafat, president of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, leader of the Labor Party and a general turned peacemaker, brought the smallest delegation, a relatively lean, mean team of mostly military men and center-left politicians like himself. This fighting trim was not intentional; it reflects the defection of the rightist parties in his government on the eve of his departure. But it could serve to streamline his approach, since he will not have to answer to the deep-seated reluctance of those ministers who would otherwise have come.</p>
        <p>''Barak is so intent he is like a horse with blinders, and this will make it simpler here, although harder when he returns home,'' an adviser to the prime minister said.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Arafat traveled to the United States not only with his senior negotiators, security professionals and economic advisers but with some opposition party leaders and with a vocal critic as the appointed spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Barak, a democratic leader, Mr. Arafat, who is often considered to be an authoritarian, has surrounded himself with a consensus-building organism. The opposition leaders are not inside Camp David -- in fact, the Americans would not admit them when they banged at the gate this week -- but even within the group inside, there is a spectrum ranging from the more pragmatic to the more cynical, from money men to ideologues.</p>
        <p>Some American and Israeli officials think Mr. Arafat would not have made the journey in such complete Palestinian company if he were not intent on reaching some kind of deal.</p>
        <p>But an adviser to Mr. Arafat cautioned that the Palestinian leader has always ''tried to bring people inside his tent'' -- and that has been a strength and a weakness. Sometimes, hard-liners have kept him ''too pure,'' an Israeli official said.</p>
        <p>Also, the main opposition leaders, like Sheik Ahmed Yassin of the radical Islamic group Hamas, did not unite behind the peace effort.</p>
        <p>''This time,'' a former diplomat said, ''Arafat will only make a deal when it is to his advantage and he won't let artificial deadlines force him into something he doesn't want to do.'' That deadline is President Clinton's scheduled departure for Okinawa on Wednesday for the meeting of major industrial nations.</p>
        <p>Behind Mr. Clinton at Camp David, there is a triptych of diplomats who -- sometimes symbiotically, sometimes competitively -- have devoted themselves to the Middle East since the 1980's: Dennis Ross, 52, chief Middle East peace envoy; his deputy, Aaron D. Miller, 51; and Martin Indyk, 49, who is now on his second tour as ambassador to Israel.</p>
        <p>For all three men, their formative experience was the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Mr. Miller and Mr. Indyk were graduate students in Israel; Mr. Ross had just left. And as young Jewish intellectuals, colleagues say, they came away believing that Israel needed peace with its neighbors as badly as it needed to be protected from another devastating war.</p>
        <p>From that conviction, their concept of Israel grew, fortified by a strong security relationship with the United States, making peace with its neighbors through incremental steps. These ideas were developed by Mr. Indyk, who became the first director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, an offshoot of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and by Mr. Ross, who perched there briefly in 1992.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Clinton became president, he gave the three men a chance to turn position papers into policy. Mr. Indyk, an Australian, became an American citizen in order to do so.</p>
        <p>The three began with the 1993 Oslo interim peace accord. Mr. Miller cultivated relations with Mr. Arafat, whom he had first met in Tunis. Mr. Ross and Mr. Indyk concentrated on the Israelis. And when Mr. Barak was elected prime minister last year, the three made little secret of their pleasure at having an Israeli leader whose peacemaking platform matched theirs.</p>
        <p>Palestinians, who think that American policy has long been skewed toward Israel, frequently note quietly that all three American negotiators are Jewish. But over the course of their repeated trekking to Gaza and Ramallah to visit Mr. Arafat, the three have come to be seen as fair -- although this judgment could fray in the heat of negotiations.</p>
        <p>Before leaving for the meeting, one of the three said that it was the most ''extraordinary development'' he had experienced in 20 years. ''The stakes are incredibly high,'' he said -- and it was clear he was talking personally and diplomatically.</p>
        <p>Stakes are high, of course, for all present. There is not a single Palestinian official with Mr. Arafat's stature. But in the speculation about who would succeed the 70-year-old leader, his longtime deputies, Abu Ala and Abu Mazen, are the top contenders. They are formally positioned to split his two roles: Abu Ala to succeed him as president of the Palestinian National Authority and Abu Mazen as chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>As such, they have an investment in negotiating a final peace accord that could stand the test of time. And yet, while they are both relative moderates within the Palestinian world, the delegation's official position is that the summit meeting is being held too soon, without the proper groundwork laid for a full or even partial resolution of outstanding problems.</p>
        <p>Inside Camp David, Mr. Abu Ala, 63, a pragmatist and strong strategist, is certain to play the visible lead role. Although Mr. Arafat occasionally considers him a bit too independent, he has relied on Mr. Abu Ala for the hands-on part of all key negotiations. Mr. Abu Mazen, 65, the godfather of the breakthrough Oslo talks in 1993, is more the overseer.</p>
        <p>Palestinians think of Mr. Abu Ala, a forceful white-haired politician who comes from the town of Abu Dis, adjacent to Jerusalem, as a businessman for his role overseeing P.L.O. investments, and consider that the key to his negotiating skill. He negotiated the 1995 interim peace agreement, Oslo II. But, on the plane ride to Washington for the signing ceremony, Mr. Arafat informed him that Mr. Abu Mazen would sign the agreement and deliver the speech. Mr. Abu Ala was crestfallen, and withdrew to the sidelines of the negotiation process for some time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu Ala was accorded no official role in the present final-status peace negotiations. But he played the more important unofficial part in back-channel talks that eventually moved to Stockholm this spring and became the main channel.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, Mr. Abu Mazen, whose West Bank villa in Ramallah has been the site for late-night meetings of Israeli and Palestinian leaders, oversaw secret contacts between the P.L.O. and progressive Israelis. As a result of relationships he nurtured, Israeli doves and American peace negotiators regarded him as the most flexible Palestinian official. This made it difficult for him to play a central role, because it discredited him on the Palestinian streets. But Mr. Abu Mazen, anyway, prefers to be behind the scenes, thinking the big thoughts.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, a political scientist who is almost 20 years younger, has been most visible to Americans, since he makes media appearances and whispers English translations into Mr. Arafat's ears. He was not an original member of the P.L.O., never lived in exile and is thus considered to be in better touch with popular sentiments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Erekat made his diplomatic entrance by defying his superiors' orders in the Madrid peace talks in 1991, when the Palestinians were trying to keep a low profile. He walked into the talks with a kaffiyeh draped over his shoulder. Mr. Arafat scolded him later, but Mr. Erekat disarmed him by saying, ''Mr. Chairman, I felt I was carrying a piece of you inside.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is also accompanied by his senior security chief, Mohammed Dahlan; his information minister, Yasir Abed Rabbo, who plays the role of house skeptic; and his senior economic adviser, Mohammed Rachid, who is an Iraqi-born Kurd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachid is the most pragmatic and least ideological of the delegation and Mr. Arafat is said to feel indebted to him for creating the monopoly businesses that generated the first income for the Palestinian Authority -- along with allegations of cronyism and corruption. Before the summit meeting, Mr. Rachid was preparing the Palestinians' compensation demands -- $40 billion, mostly for refugees -- and making clear that he would steer Mr. Arafat toward the practical if he could.</p>
        <p>The Israeli delegation is not a well-oiled peace team, like the Americans and the Palestinians, but a disparate, experienced group of politicians, lawyers and generals. At the last minute, after the meeting had begun, Mr. Barak summoned Dan Meridor, a right-leaning legislator, to round out the center-left delegation.</p>
        <p>Elyakim Rubinstein, a religious Jew and the attorney general, was reportedly reluctant to come. But he is there as the government's lawyer, and as the only delegate who participated in the original Camp David in 1978, bringing with him the accumulated experience of all the peace agreements from then on. Insiders say that he also tells the jokes.</p>
        <p>The two central negotiators are Mr. Ben-Ami and Gilad Sher, a private lawyer who used to be a lawyer for the military. Mr. Barak trusts Mr. Sher, who negotiated the most recent interim agreement last September, precisely because he is apolitical.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben-Ami, on the other hand, is a Moroccan-born Israeli. He rose from humble beginnings to become an Oxford-educated historian and Israeli diplomat who, in the most recent Labor Party primary, shot up to the top spot behind Mr. Barak. Insiders say that it signals Mr. Barak's keen desire for an agreement that he is willing to use him as a resource, to tolerate his meetings with President Clinton on the back porch of the Aspen Cabin, which surely raise Mr. Ben-Ami's political capital.</p>
        <p>''But Barak is confident, more confident than I have ever seen him,'' said an Israeli cabinet minister. ''At Camp David, he is everything. The team is not essential. They are just there to fill the chairs, make the atmosphere.''</p>
