      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It long ago overcame the image of its name, so much so that the White Elephant Hotel, which has overlooked Nantucket Harbor in Massachusetts for nearly 80 years at 50 Easton Street, has reopened after a renovation that nearly doubled its size. The hotel, closed since October, welcomed guests on June 22 to a new wing and larger rooms. Despite the increase in size, the hotel has the same number of rooms, 54, plus 12 cottages. It is owned by Stephen and Jill Karp, owners of the Wauwinet, also in Nantucket.</p>
        <p>The new wing is covered in cedar shingles to match the other structures, and has an airy porch. It has 40 rooms, while the old main building now has only 14 -- all doubled in size, with sitting areas and two bathrooms each.</p>

        <p>It long ago overcame the image of its name, so much so that the White Elephant Hotel, which has overlooked Nantucket Harbor in Massachusetts for nearly 80 years at 50 Easton Street, has reopened after a renovation that nearly doubled its size.

It is owned by Stephen and Jill Karp, owners of the Wauwinet, also in Nantucket.</p>
        <p>The new wing is covered in cedar shingles to match the other structures, and has an airy porch. It has 40 rooms, while the old main building now has only 14 -- all doubled in size, with sitting areas and two bathrooms each.</p>
        <p>Both buildings have rattan chairs with leather seats and beds with leather headboards, hand-painted lamps and linenlike fabrics in neutral colors; many rooms have fireplaces. The bathrooms have white ceramic tile and marble counters. All rooms have DVD players and high-speed Internet connections, as does the business center.</p>
        <p>Summer rates, which include full breakfast at the hotel's refurbished Brant Point Grill, start at $450 for standard doubles and $465 for suites. Reservations: (800) 475-2637, fax (508) 325-1195.</p>
