        <p>The second month of the season had not ended, and the San Francisco Giants were nine games from first place. Is that any way to maintain a reputation for always being in the race? No, but look again. The Giants are very much in the National League West race.</p>
        <p>It's the old Dusty Baker hocus-pocus. It is becoming a cliche that Baker always has his team in contention, that he gets more out of his players than most managers do out of theirs. But it is all true. And now Barry Bonds has unveiled Baker's secret. It's the food.</p>
        <p>''He always brings food in every day,'' Bonds said. ''I got to have my greens, macaroni and cheese. He always brings something. He takes care of everybody. When he knows you're down and out, he does something to perk you up. When you're struggling, he'll say: 'Here, I brought you lunch. You're looking a little weak. I want you to get strong. You need to eat better.' He takes care of you.''</p>
        <p>There's nothing fancy about the food Baker provides his players, Bonds said. ''Latin food, soul food, regular food. Dusty knows every restaurant in every city, and he can get you whatever you want in any city. I know that for a fact.''</p>
        <p>When Baker was informed that Bonds had blown his secret, he readily acknowledged his nutrition contribution.</p>
        <p>''It started when I was in Atlanta and Los Angeles,'' Baker said, referring to his playing days. ''I learned it from Hank.'' That would be Aaron.</p>
        <p>''Hank would get on me about eating better, more nutritionally,'' Baker said. ''I learned from him, especially about breakfast time before day games. In the seventh inning you wondered why your legs were wobbly after a triple. You got to stay strong.''</p>
        <p>Baker said when he began coaching, ''I'd see guys coming in with a bag from McDonald's or Arby's or Taco Bell and they'd wonder why they were tired late in the game. I believe in the guys eating right. Especially on the road. It's more important on the road because guys don't eat right on the road.''</p>
        <p>Baker said he offered the players a variety of food, mentioning collard greens, black-eyed peas, macaroni and cheese, grits, hash browns, bacon, eggs, sausages. He estimated that he spends $50 or $60 a day.</p>
        <p>The manager has another reason for bringing food to the clubhouse for his players. ''I don't like to share my food with anyone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for Bonds's claim that Baker knows every restaurant in every city, he said: ''That's close. They're not all the prettiest, but they serve the best food.''</p>
        <p>''It's part of the job,'' he said of his one-man food delivery service. ''You've got to be nutritionally strong. In the end only the strong survive.''</p>
        <p>The Giants survive nicely under Baker. This season is an example.</p>
        <p>A seven-game losing streak in April? A seven-game winning streak the first eight days of May. An eight-game losing streak in May? An eight-game winning the first eight days of July. The Giants have a way of canceling out their mistakes.</p>
        <p>''We're just steady,'' said Bonds, who in the first two games after the All-Star Game hit his 29th and 30th home runs, giving him 475 for his career. ''We're a 200,000-mile car. We're a team that just keeps going. We'll always be in the yard. Do we get through the door? I don't know, but we're going to be in your yard.''</p>
        <p>And where there's a yard, there's a house.</p>
        <p>''We have guys who like to play every day,'' Bonds said. ''We don't have the best talent on the field. We don't have the best team. We don't care that we don't. We care that when you come into our house or we go into your house, you got a fight; you got a game. You got to play. Then whatever comes, comes.''</p>
        <p>Slumping Reds Concede</p>
        <p>When the Reds acquired Ken Griffey Jr. last February, they and their fans figuratively (maybe some literally) danced in the streets. Next stop, the World Series. Or at least the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Proving once again that there is no sure thing and that no one player can singlehandedly produce a division championship, the Reds conceded their playoff chances last week by trading their best pitcher to the Yankees. They kept their best hitter.</p>
        <p>Some critics might place some of the blame on Griffey for the disappointing season. He had difficulty getting out of the low .200's the first two months of the season and began post-All-Star Game play hitting only .238. But he also was tied for second in home runs and tied for fourth in runs batted in among National League batters.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's complaining, saying I'm having the worst year of my career,'' Griffey said. ''But if you look at my numbers, the only thing that's down is my batting average.''</p>
        <p>A .299 career hitter, Griffey hit .300 or better in 7 of his 11 seasons with the Mariners. Two of his sub-.300 seasons came the last two years when he hit .284 and .285. Why has he struggled with his average this season?</p>
        <p>''Just trying to do too much,'' he said. And why would that be? ''That's how it works. You want to get off to a good start in a new atmosphere. You want to go out there and do some things. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't and you find yourself in a situation you don't want to be in. You go out and work hard and do things to try to get yourself better. That's all I can do. That's what I've been doing.''</p>
        <p>But even a .300 Griffey average would most likely not have been able to overcome the Reds' pitching deficiencies. Except for Denny Neagle, now at a new address in New York, the Reds' starters have struggled. The earned run averages tell the tale: Pete Harnisch 7.52, Ron Villone 5.98, Steve Parris 5.26. The staff E.R.A., 4.81, placed the Reds halfway between the N.L.'s lowest (Arizona's 4.21) and highest (Houston's 5.41).</p>
        <p>Reversal for Astros</p>
        <p>They trade their 22-game winner, and the pitching staff falls apart. Cause and effect?</p>
        <p>''Hambone definitely had a great year,'' Shane Reynolds of Houston said, speaking of Mike Hampton, now with the Mets. ''He was our leader last year. Losing him definitely made a difference. But to say that was the problem this year, I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>Reynolds cited Enron Field, the Astros' new home, as the primary culprit. ''We went to a new stadium that was hitter friendly,'' he said. ''It took a little time to get adjusted to it.''</p>
        <p>At the All-Star Game break the Astros had a 30-57 record. They played the same number of games before the All-Star Game last year and had a 50-37 record. This season and last Jose Lima pitched the last game before the break. Last year he emerged from the game with his 13th victory against four defeats en route to a 21-victory season; this time he gained only his second victory against 13 defeats.</p>
        <p>The numbers attached to Lima's name this season are eye-opening. Besides having the most losses in the league, he has allowed the most runs, earned runs and home runs. His 7.36 E.R.A. is more than twice his season's 3.58 last year. The 29 home runs he gave up in 18 starts and 106 1/3 innings before the break were one shy of his 1999 total of 30 in 35 starts and 246 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>''He has no physical problems, no mental problems,'' Reynolds said. ''He still has the confidence. He got on a bad streak and couldn't get off. He pitched seven good innings for us Sunday and got a win. He said the second half is going to be different. He's going to start over. He hasn't changed at all. I think that's great, especially for a guy who goes from 21 wins to having a year like this. He's still Jose Lima.''</p>
        <p>An 'Amazing' Ex-Met</p>
        <p>No player at the All-Star Game last week was more excited about being there or more unlikely to be there.</p>
        <p>''I don't see how it's possible that I'm here, especially all the stuff I've been through,'' Jason Isringhausen said. ''I'm pretty excited about this. It's an amazing feeling. I didn't know if this day would ever come.''</p>
        <p>Isringhausen once upon a time was part of the foundation of the Mets' future. He was a starting pitcher then. Now, one shoulder operation and two elbow operations later, he is a relief pitcher and the Oakland Athletics closer. Nineteen saves earned him a spot on the American League All-Star team.</p>
        <p>''It's fun,'' Isringhausen said of his new job. ''I blew three saves in a row, but it was still fun. That's part of the game. The failure and the success all come together. I'm really enjoying this role. I like it better than starting. I enjoy going out there for one inning. I'm either going to succeed or fail. There are no no-decisions out there.''</p>
        <p>It would seem to have been a master stroke by the Athletics to have traded for Isringhausen last season with the idea of making him their closer, but the Mets also had thought about the possibility, even though they had John Franco.</p>
        <p>''We had talked about it in the minor leagues,'' the 27-year-old right-hander said. ''They thought I had the right makeup for it. But with the guys in the big leagues at the time, there was no sense in even fathoming it then because the guy with 400 saves is ahead of you and it's hard to sneak in when you've never even proven yourself.''</p>
