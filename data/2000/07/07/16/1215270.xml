        <p>AFTER 30 years in the spotlight, the Moody Blues are finally doing things their own way, says Justin Hayward, the band's guitarist, vocalist and songwriter.</p>
        <p>''Our new album was produced by us, without outside influences,'' he said in a telephone interview, speaking in the soft West Country British accent that has been a familiar touchstone for millions of fans since the group's groundbreaking 1966 album, ''Days of Future Past.''</p>

        <p>AFTER 30 years in the spotlight, the Moody Blues are finally doing things their own way, says Justin Hayward, the band's guitarist, vocalist and songwriter.</p>
        <p>''Our new album was produced by us, without outside influences,'' he said in a telephone interview, speaking in the soft West Country British accent that has been a familiar touchstone for millions of fans since the group's groundbreaking 1966 album, ''Days of Future Past.''</p>
        <p>''Our last album had four different producers, styles and interpretations,'' said Mr. Hayward, 54. ''This one is all ours, and the tour, I guess, is symbolic of that autonomy as well.''</p>
        <p>The Moodies, as they are called by their legions of deeply devoted fans, will perform songs from that new album, ''Strange Times,'' along with many of their classic hits next Friday at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayward is still excited about the album, which was released late last year. ''We believe it's the best album we've done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That says a lot for a band that has produced 20 recordings, many of which are regarded as classics. Moody Blues albums feature a blend of lush songs that range from classically inspired to straight-ahead rock, including magisterial spoken word, psychedelic guitars, Mellotron and unabashed romanticism. The band has done it all, and much of it with a spiritual bent.</p>
        <p>''This album has a lot of meaning to us,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''There were no inhibitions, everything was bounced off us. It is very personal. We were having our own way creating it and it was quite lovely.'' This time around, for the Moody Blues, creating a personal album was a good experience, as opposed to 1978's ''Octave,'' which he recalled as ''painful,'' and was recorded in an uneasy professional and personal period for the band.</p>
        <p>''Strange Times,'' a simpler, more spare album, was easier for the band. ''It is based on things that come naturally to us,'' he said. ''And no one was telling us what to do.''</p>
        <p>The Moody Blues savor their independence. They even manage themselves. ''Oh, we've had managers, but they would end up saying: 'Why don't you just manage yourselves? You keep telling me what to do anyway.' ''</p>
        <p>The current tour, still in its early days, ''is great fun'' for Mr. Hayward. It is also the first time in many years that the group has toured without a backing orchestra. ''There's a little more rock 'n' roll in what we're doing now,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''It's a little bit clearer.''</p>
        <p>One would think that the road would get tiresome for a band that has been touring on and off for 30 years. ''Quite honestly, we don't stop laughing,'' he said of his bandmates and longtime friends, John Lodge, Ray Thomas and Graeme Edge.</p>
        <p>The Moodies have enjoyed many hits, including ''I'm Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band),'' ''Ride My See-Saw,'' ''The Story in Your Eyes'' and the wistful and ambitious ''Tuesday Afternoon.'' But no song from their canon has had the powerful impact that has been generated by Mr. Hayward's plaintive ''Nights in White Satin.'' It was the first time a rock band collaborated with a symphony, and the lyrical, dreamy song became a rock milestone.</p>
        <p>Although the Moody Blues's audience keeps growing, and there is a new generation of young fans, the band's original followers have strong memories of the song.</p>
        <p>''I remember writing that song, so clearly, so distinctly,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''I was 19 when I wrote it and it is one of the clearest memories I have. I remember working it up and then Mike played part. I remember it as if it was yesterday, because I had such mixed-up feelings then. I was going through a turbulent and emotional time.''</p>
        <p>Fans will have a chance to hop through three decades of memories, thanks to the Moody Blues's affection for their fans. Their concert demonstrates the full spectrum of what the complex band is all about. The songs range from the 1960's classics like ''Nights'' and ''Tuesday Afternoon,'' to the 80's, a decade Mr. Hayward laughingly described as the only decade ''when we actually had hits'' like ''I Know You're Out There'' and ''Your Wildest Dreams.'' And, of course, selections from ''Strange Times,'' like Mr. Hayward's favorite, ''English Sunset.''</p>
        <p>In 1993 the band released a live album from Red Rocks, Colo., which was a top-seller. They are about to release another live album, recorded at Albert Hall in London. Mr. Hayward refers to these as ''the big events that the band floats between.''</p>
        <p>In an age of one-hit wonders, why is it that a band like the Moody Blues continues to attract new fans and hold on to their old ones? ''It's simple,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''We have loyal followers who I assume are interested in good songs that stand the test of time. We have fun on stage, and it's a pleasure to share that with our audience.''</p>
        <p>THE MOODY BLUES  PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, off the Garden State Parkway, Holmdel.  Friday at 7:30 p.m.  (201) 507-8900.</p>
