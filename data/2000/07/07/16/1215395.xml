        <p>IT took Martha Stewart a dozen years, a slew of books and a lifetime of self-promotion to get the kind of attention Ellen Wright has been showered with since her first book hit the stores last month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wright is a hostess in tony media circles who has written ''Bridgehampton Weekends'' (William Morrow &amp; Company), a coffee-table tome of recipes sprinkled with photos of Long Island idylls. For a book party last Saturday at Ms. Wright's home on Mitchell's Lane in  -- where else? -- Bridgehampton, the list of co-hosts barely fitted on the invitation. It included Mort Zuckerman; Don Hewitt; Alan C. Greenberg, known as Ace, chairman of Bear Stearns; and Pete Peterson, of the Blackstone Group, and his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney. It was the fourth such party in Ms. Wright's honor. Tom Brokaw gave one at his apartment in Manhattan, Vernon Jordan was host of another in Washington, and Lew Wasserman, former chairman of MCA, had his own in Los Angeles. Her friends have also helped her score guest spots on ''Good Morning America'' and ''Larry King Live.''</p>

        <p>IT took Martha Stewart a dozen years, a slew of books and a lifetime of self-promotion to get the kind of attention Ellen Wright has been showered with since her first book hit the stores last month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wright is a hostess in tony media circles who has written ''Bridgehampton Weekends'' (William Morrow &amp; Company), a coffee-table tome of recipes sprinkled with photos of Long Island idylls. For a book party last Saturday at Ms. Wright's home on Mitchell's Lane in  -- where else? -- Bridgehampton, the list of co-hosts barely fitted on the invitation. It included Mort Zuckerman; Don Hewitt; Alan C. Greenberg, known as Ace, chairman of Bear Stearns; and Pete Peterson, of the Blackstone Group, and his wife, Joan Ganz Cooney. It was the fourth such party in Ms. Wright's honor. Tom Brokaw gave one at his apartment in Manhattan, Vernon Jordan was host of another in Washington, and Lew Wasserman, former chairman of MCA, had his own in Los Angeles. Her friends have also helped her score guest spots on ''Good Morning America'' and ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>Still, for someone who has spent so much of her life surrounded by savvy media types, Ms. Wright, 60, seemed oddly ambivalent about finding herself at the center of the fuss she helped create. As she led a visitor on a tour of her 4,800-square-foot home, Ms. Wright insisted it wasn't even her idea to line up her glittery friends as co-hosts for the party. She said the publicist Peggy Siegal convinced her that enlisting them would help generate buzz to sell books. Blushing slightly, gray bob swinging gently, she conceded that she had even been coaxed into hiring a hair-and-make-up person for the evening.</p>
        <p>''This isn't really my kind of thing,'' she said, as guests, ferried from their cars in golf carts, poured in. ''I really don't know a lot of these people.''</p>
        <p>As the party got going around the pool, there wasn't much mixing among Ms. Wright's old-guard media friends like Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Zuckerman and Alan Patricof and Ms. Siegal's coterie of socialites, including Tiffany Dubin, Vera Wang and Beth Rudin DeWoody. Each group mingled expertly with its own, and the evening took on a well-practiced air, a movable cocktail party vibe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wright looked vaguely uneasy. Her usual style of entertaining is to have six or eight friends over for dinner in the kitchen. ''I like things to be cozy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It is that lack of pretension that makes Ms. Wright a popular hostess. A sculptor and interior decorator who also worked as an assistant to James Beard, she has been giving dinner parties since the 1960's, when she arrived in New York after college in California. Among her oldest pals are Pia Lindstrom and the director Mark Rydell. Almost 30 years ago, she met Tom Brokaw, who has ''practically lived in my kitchen'' ever since, she said, adding, ''I just like to cook for friends of mine who happen to be famous.''</p>
        <p>In the late 1960's, she married Mitch Rosenthal, the founder of Phoenix House, the drug rehabilitation center. Her entertaining was crucial to its fund-raising, said Mr. Rosenthal, whom she divorced in the early 1980's. One Passover her family Seder expanded at the last minute to include James Beard, the actor Ben Gazzara and Bette Midler.</p>
        <p>At the book party, the consensus was that Ms. Wright's finest cocktail hour came last summer: a birthday hoedown, complete with fried chicken and cornbread, for her present husband, Joe Wright, a former Reagan administration official.</p>
        <p>Her friends also agreed easily as to who was the worst square dancer. ''Mort, definitely,'' Susan Patricof said, referring to Mr. Zuckerman. ''He had a left-right problem.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wright responded gently, as always. ''It was lovely to see people loosen up,'' she said. ''That's what really makes things fun.''</p>
