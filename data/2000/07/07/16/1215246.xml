        <p>DIVERSIFICATION is much on the minds of home builders these days as market conditions, demographic trends and regulatory constraints are nudging them to branch out into different segments of the housing market.</p>
        <p>Three developers moving in new directions are cases in point:</p>
        <p>*The Kushner Companies of Florham Park, best known as an owner of garden-style rental apartments, are planning to convert a motel in West Long Branch in Monmouth County to the companies' first  assisted-living center, offering housing along with meals and personal care to elderly residents.</p>
        <p>*Pinnacle Communities of Millburn, which for the last decade has built luxury single-family attached and detached homes, is entering the market for residential retirement communities, with 120 homes for buyers age 55 and over in Washington Township in Warren County.</p>
        <p>*The Matzel &amp; Mumford Organization of Hazlet, a developer of upscale single-family homes, is returning to the town-house market after a nine-year absence with a 262-unit project in Montgomery Township in Somerset County.</p>
        <p>''When sites are available, developers will move into areas they have not traditionally been in if the market is there and they can make money,'' said Joanne Harkins, the director of land-use and planning at the New Jersey Builders Association in Robbinsville.</p>
        <p>Constraining factors that developers are facing include the dwindling supply of land in New Jersey and more restrictive zoning.  In the next decade the state plans to buy up  a million acres of open space, and in the last several years, it has been encouraging development in urban areas, where utilities, roads and mass transit are in place, and discouraging it in rural areas.</p>
        <p>Some developers, Ms. Harkins said, have responded by redeveloping former industrial sites in cities or recycling abandoned buildings in older suburbs. Others, she added, are entering the housing market for the elderly with assisted-living or ''55 and over'' projects, a nod to the state's aging population.</p>
        <p>David Schoner, a vice president in the new homes and land division of Coldwell Banker, the residential brokerage company with headquarters in Short Hills, said developers also favor housing for the elderly because many municipalities view it favorably, since it has less impact on municipal services, especially schools, than other high-density projects.</p>
        <p>Dr. James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said,  ''With the tidal wave of maturing baby boomers entering the market, developers basically will be life-cycle riding.'' Dr. Hughes noted that next year the first baby boomers will turn 55, a milestone that successive waves of boomers -- by definition those people born between 1946 and 1964 -- will hit during the next 18 years.</p>
        <p>FROM here forward, Dr. Hughes said, empty nesters will determine the course of new construction. In turn, he said, housing that offers a maintenance-free living, like condominium town houses, makes sense, as do projects that offer entertainment and recreational amenities.</p>
        <p>These shifts are occurring when the state's residential market is slowing a bit in response to rising interest rates and a turbulent stock market. Jeffrey Otteau, the president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, said that prices have risen 10 to 25 percent for all types of housing in the last year and as a result, ''buyers are stepping out of the market.'' Sales activity is down, the supply of homes, particularly resales, is up and houses that a few months ago sold in hours or days are taking weeks to sell, he added.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Otteau said he expected the slowdown to last at least until October, ''it is still a strong real estate market.'' His advice to developers: ''Know your market.''</p>
        <p>That is an exercise the Kushner Companies went through before deciding to convert a 100-room motel on Route 36, next to Monmouth Raceway in West Long Branch,  into an assisted-living residence. Though the growth of such projects has leveled off, ''we think there is a niche we can fill,'' said Jeffrey Freireich, a managing director.  ''Unlike most of the high-end projects that have been built. this will be more economical for tenants,'' he added, because Kushner will save money by converting an existing structure.</p>
        <p>''In just 10 years,'' Mr. Freireich said,  ''the number of Monmouth County residents 75 and older -- the age group we're targeting -- increased by 22 percent.''</p>
        <p>The $8 million project, which will begin this fall and will be called the Esplanade at West Long Branch, is being developed with the Scharf family, which runs similar residences for the elderly in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, and FBE Limited, a real estate partnership in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The conversion will include the renovation of all the rooms, which average 325 square feet. A new front entrance will be added and the grounds of the four-acre site will be landscaped. Rents, including all meals and services, will be $2,500 to $2,900 a month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freireich said his company planned to develop similar projects ''on a selective basis'' until the assisted-living market  strengthens, because this housing segment ''makes sense for us.''</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, a Kushner company, Westminster Communities, has gained a foothold in ''55 and over'' housing, known as the ''active adult'' market. It has seven such projects in New Jersey, totaling 1,441 residences, in various stages of the development. Among them is Sea Oaks, with 376 single-family homes, under way in Little Egg Harbor.</p>
        <p>That is the market Pinnacle Communities is also pursuing. It is advancing plans for the Village at Hawk Pointe, with 120 detached houses on 31 acres adjacent to an 18-hole golf course on Route 31, not far from Interstate 78 in Washington Township.</p>
        <p>Having built upscale housing with no age restrictions, ''we want to bring that edge to the 'active adult' market where there is an unmet demand for larger, more expensive homes,'' said Paul Schneier, the vice president for operations at Pinnacle. Other factors in Pinnacle's decision, he said, are that many towns are more receptive to such projects, shortening the approval process; demographics support them; and Warren County is not saturated with ''55 and over''  housing.</p>
        <p>Pinnacle is under contract to buy the site contingent upon receiving local approvals, he said. If approved, the project will be part of a 317-acre development that will include  the golf course and up to 340,000 square feet of commercial space, which Pinnacle will build with the developers of the golf course.</p>
        <p>As now envisioned, the 120 houses, each with 2,000 to 3,000 square feet, will sit on lots of about a quarter acre. The initial prices are expected to be $300,000 to $350,000.  Amenities planned include a clubhouse and pool. Construction of the houses, a $40 million project, is to start early next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneier said that Pinnacle was planning two other such communities in New Jersey, each with 100 to 200 homes. ''It's an opportunity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That is also the way Roger Mumford, the president of the Matzel &amp; Mumford Organization, described his company's purchase of  76 acres with approvals in place for 262 town houses on Blue Spring Road, off Route 206 in Montgomery. ''Given our desire to diversify and the lack of large suitably zoned land, we jumped on it,'' Mr. Mumford said.</p>
        <p>Montgomery Hills, as the project will be known, is the undeveloped portion of an earlier project that began in the 1980's. The site was rezoned for town houses to help the township meet its obligation under the state's Mount Laurel doctrine, which requires municipalities to provide zoning for low- and moderate-income housing. The previous developer built just the first 84 of the 346 town houses originally planned. Matzel &amp; Mumford will build the remaining town houses, along with 60 rental apartments for people 55 and older with low to moderate incomes and 35 condo apartments with income, but not age, restrictions.</p>
        <p>''There is a solid market for town houses,'' said Mr. Mumford, whose company became an affiliate of K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schoner of Coldwell Banker said, ''Town houses will be the first step out of single-family homes for many baby boomers.'' Mr. Otteau, the appraiser, agreed, and added that because the prices for detached houses have risen faster than those for town houses, entry-level buyers are choosing them as starter homes for the first time in 15 years.</p>
        <p>The town houses at Montgomery Hills, with 1,661 to 2,220 square feet, will cater to both markets, Mr. Mumford said. Construction and sales are expected to begin next month, and prices are expected to start at $230,000.</p>
