        <p>IT is a melancholy experience to make someone's acquaintance, become increasingly enthralled by his wit and passion, become aware that you're watching him waste away, and then have him die on you, all in the space of 80 minutes. That's what happens in Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen's documentary, ''Benjamin Smoke,'' opening on Friday. Benjamin, who went by just the one name (legally he was Robert Dickerson), was the singer and lyricist for a band called Smoke, hence the title. They were a local sensation in Atlanta and recorded two CD's (''Another Reason to Fast'' and ''Heaven on a Popsicle Stick'') for a local label, but they weren't well known elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Benjamin, a native of Jonesboro, Ga., was a speed freak and a pill-head and a drag queen, as well as a considerable stream-of-consciousness poet and an inspired singer whose deep growl of a voice could slide from rumination to peaks of intensity that bring to mind flamenco vocalists. The film is not, however, primarily a musical document, and its makers were certainly not aware when they began how the story would end. ''We just wanted to capture something that we knew was remarkable,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And even before we knew that Benjamin was sick, we knew that it might not last.''</p>

        <p>IT is a melancholy experience to make someone's acquaintance, become increasingly enthralled by his wit and passion, become aware that you're watching him waste away, and then have him die on you, all in the space of 80 minutes. That's what happens in Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen's documentary, ''Benjamin Smoke,'' opening on Friday.

They were a local sensation in Atlanta and recorded two CD's (''Another Reason to Fast'' and ''Heaven on a Popsicle Stick'') for a local label, but they weren't well known elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Benjamin, a native of Jonesboro, Ga., was a speed freak and a pill-head and a drag queen, as well as a considerable stream-of-consciousness poet and an inspired singer whose deep growl of a voice could slide from rumination to peaks of intensity that bring to mind flamenco vocalists. The film is not, however, primarily a musical document, and its makers were certainly not aware when they began how the story would end. ''We just wanted to capture something that we knew was remarkable,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''And even before we knew that Benjamin was sick, we knew that it might not last.''</p>
        <p>It's clear within five minutes that one reason Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sillen started the movie was that they wanted to record Benjamin talking. The mode is queer Southern, dry humor and languorous drawl, nonstop legato chatter with laugh lines that crest slowly and break somewhere offshore. The talk emerges from a wide, straight mouth set in a cadaverous face topped with bangs that make Benjamin look a bit like a medieval monk. By way of punctuation he smokes constantly and pulls almost as constantly on a container of soda pop.</p>
        <p>He is comfortable in his skin; he talks about his life without regret or inflation. He started fooling around with drag when he was 9, found his destiny as a teenager when he heard Patti Smith's album ''Horses,'' went to New York in 1978 only to spend his time there sweeping up broken glass at CBGB, returned to Georgia and got involved in dozens of bands, from ephemeral punk confrontation to something much harder to pin down.</p>
        <p>The story involves tiny audiences, lowdown venues and police raids. There are photographs of Benjamin in drag, looking sleek. Other pictures, ravaged by dampness, have patches of emulsion missing and look contaminated.</p>
        <p>Benjamin lived in a part of Atlanta called Cabbagetown, formerly a mill town inhabited by immigrants from Appalachia. The mill closed in the 1970's and the place became a slum. The camera frequently darts outside to the desolate frame houses scattered at what look like random angles around the landscape, and to the young people, ''who go to jail early and whose parents use inhalants,'' in Benjamin's words, as they work on their Go Karts outside his window.</p>
        <p>The place feels lost in time, an outcropping of the 20th century that came unglued somewhere between the Truman and Johnson administrations and now rattles around like dice in a cup. You get the occasional glimpse of faceless high-rise downtown Atlanta in the distance, looking like another planet. The atmosphere of Cabbagetown seems a logical extension of Benjamin's presence and the look of his room, with its aleatory flea-market panache. It's a scavenger's aesthetic, the unfakeable sort reserved exclusively for people with imagination and no money, whose only choice is to extract beauty from discards.</p>
        <p>By the time we see Smoke play together, in rehearsal, the music, not reminiscent of much else, fits right into the prevailing tone of unpremeditated originality, as if it were the only sort of music possible. The lineup consists of cello, banjo doubling on trumpet, guitar and drums. There are certain rock elements, to be sure, and a sort of blues, and something about it related to ancient hill ballads, but nothing you could put your finger on. Like certain kinds of Middle Eastern music, it is dominated by a fluid drone that rises occasionally to frantic peaks that are then reabsorbed by the unhurried flow.</p>
        <p>Benjamin can sound as if he is making the words up on the spot, even when it is clear that he isn't, as he growls, sometimes talk-sings, sometimes wanders away from the key without doing much damage. The volume is never high, but there is an intensity at hand that emerges from pure emotional concentration -- the band members are always seated, as if they need to be.</p>
        <p>Gradually we become aware that Benjamin is in nearly constant pain. He never says so, but every time he makes a move the cost is apparent. He has AIDS, a matter about which, by his own admission, he is uncharacteristically quiet, because he doesn't want others' impressions of him to be overwhelmed and distorted by his disease. The first two-thirds of the picture, which seem to exist in an elastically stretched present tense, give way to urgency and imminence. Cabbagetown itself is changing -- you see the signs of doom: the loft conversions, the antique shops. And then Benjamin moves, at his mother's behest, to government-sponsored housing downtown, where he'll be more generally accessible. He shows the camera his pill box, a plastic grid that looks like an ice-cube tray, filled with his dozens of daily doses. He still manages to perform, even fulfilling a dream by opening for Patti Smith in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen learned of Benjamin from Michael Stipe of R.E.M., for whom he had made five music videos; Mr. Sillen is best known for documenting another eccentric Southern singer-songwriter, Vic Chesnutt. The scavenger aesthetic guides their filmmaking here, as they use bits of film left over from other jobs as well as video and Super-8 to assemble a patchwork that resembles its subject. Mr. Cohen's films are all collages to one degree or another: ''Lost Book Found,'' his dreamlike evocation of vanishing New York; ''Buried in Light,'' his harshly lyrical Eastern European travelogue; and ''Instrument,'' his document of the band Fugazi, all layer contrasts of stock, of color, and of lighting to move back and forth between the objective and the subjective. He will, for example, cut from grainy Super-8 close-up indoor talk to a majestic landscape shot in 35-millimeter but deliberately underexposed in a way that suggests it may or may not be real. You've seen that sort of mix-and-match approach before (Oliver Stone's ''Natural Born Killers'' comes to mind), but Mr. Cohen's use of it is singularly personal, and very different from one film to the next.</p>
        <p>Despite its subject's illness and death (a day after his 39th birthday), the movie is anything but grim. Benjamin's matter-of-fact humor and incredible resilience won't permit the tone to slide toward solemnity or any sort of preaching. He is a trouper who went down fighting. In the stills of his last performance, weeks before his death, he looks as though he weighs maybe 60 pounds, some of them accounted for by the slightly askew wig on his head, but his eyes don't look the least bit ready to check out. It is Patti Smith who, sometime later, eulogized Benjamin in a poem:</p>
        <p>With a throat smooth as a lamb</p>
        <p>yet dry as a branch not snapping</p>
        <p>He throws back his head</p>
        <p>yet he does not sing a thing mournful.</p>
