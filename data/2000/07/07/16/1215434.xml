      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial contends overstated estimates of eight or nine rats per New Yorker that followed sighting of rats at Gracie Mansion say more about New Yorkers' dread of rats than about actual number of rats in city, conventionally estimated at one per person</p>

        <p>When Joseph Mitchell wrote in 1944 that ''Rats are almost as fecund as germs,'' he was getting at something profound about our urban nightmares. We fear the creatures that proliferate wildly -- rats and cockroaches chiefly -- because to do so they must proliferate unseen. No really hard numbers exist on the rat population in New York City for that very reason. One of Mitchell's sources, an exterminator, estimated that the number of rats in the city had dropped from two per person around 1920 to one per person in the early 1940's, largely because of a reduction in horses and changes in construction. Since then, one rat per person in New York has come to seem like gospel.</p>
        <p>A rat is a rumor until it is seen, and then it becomes a plague. In the past few days, since the mayor proposed a rat task force after rat sightings at Gracie Mansion, the number of eight or nine rats per person has been batted around, without much foundation. The higher estimate tells us nothing about the actual number of rats in New York, but it does say something about the revulsion rats cause. It also says something about the fear of what one might call the unseen New York, the basements and tunnels, crawl spaces and plumbing that abound in our built surroundings. The more you live in the light, the more you fear the dark, though the opposite, of course, is true of rats.</p>

        <p>When Joseph Mitchell wrote in 1944 that ''Rats are almost as fecund as germs,'' he was getting at something profound about our urban nightmares.

        <p>A rat is a rumor until it is seen, and then it becomes a plague. In the past few days, since the mayor proposed a rat task force after rat sightings at Gracie Mansion, the number of eight or nine rats per person has been batted around, without much foundation. The higher estimate tells us nothing about the actual number of rats in New York, but it does say something about the revulsion rats cause. It also says something about the fear of what one might call the unseen New York, the basements and tunnels, crawl spaces and plumbing that abound in our built surroundings. The more you live in the light, the more you fear the dark, though the opposite, of course, is true of rats.</p>
        <p>It takes a shock from time to time, like seeing rats at Gracie Mansion, to re-energize the task of rat control. From a low of about 200 employees and a budget of $5 million in the early 1990's, the Health Department's Pest Control Bureau has grown in size to some 375 employees and a budget of about $13 million, closer to what it was in the 1970's. Rats are supreme opportunists, and with every slight change in the way humans handle garbage, there is a change in the number of rats to handle it for us. Street collection instead of incineration, plastic bags instead of garbage cans -- each of these changes has had an impact on the rat population.</p>
        <p>Knowing that rats will always be with us does not mean we have to like it. Although in the broader health picture they are a nuisance, not a threat, their fleas carry the same diseases as they always have, and rat bites are as dangerous as ever. But rats also communicate something besides disease. ''Away from their nests,'' Mitchell wrote, rats ''are usually on the edge of hysteria,'' and at the sight of them we tend to know just how they feel.</p>
