        <p>Grazing Horses. Rolling green pastures. The Wild West? Nope, Queens.</p>
        <p>Around Howard Beach, there are seven horse stables and a year-old tack shop; the only one in the area, where a wall banner says, ''This is Horse Country.''</p>
        <p>At 83-11 South Conduit Avenue, in a red steel shack on the premises of the Cedar Lane Stable, Debbie's Reins and Things supplies riders with equine equipment,  from reins ($25 to $75) and harnesses ($15 to $100) to belt buckles ($20 to $50) and riding helmets ($55).</p>
        <p>''Since we had all the horses here and we had the need for it,'' said Debra Singleton, the shop's owner, ''why not?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Singleton (above), began riding at 13 and has a 25-year-old Belgian quarter horse,Justice. She said the closest fully stocked riding supply shop is half an hour away in Elmont on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''If we need something for the horse immediately, like Band-Aids or ointment, she has it there,'' said Jesse Ellis,  assistant vice president at the Federation of Black Cowboys, the organization that owns and operates the stables.</p>
        <p>Ms. Singleton, also a full-time administrative specialist at Bell Atlantic, runs the shop with the help of her mother, Betty Johnson. In April, they were awarded a loan from the Regional Economic Development Assistance Corporation, a program that aids start-up businesses. With the loan, $15,000 over two and a half years, Ms. Singleton has been able to renovate the store and put up a Web site at www.debbiesreinsandthings.com.</p>
