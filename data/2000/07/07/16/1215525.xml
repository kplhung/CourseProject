        <p>SAY what you will about dog shows, but where else are you going to learn that the first officer of the Titanic had a Newfoundland on board? Not in that high-priced, dog-ignoring Leonardo DiCaprio movie, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>Viewers of the World Dog Show on the USA Network learned that item of canine history from last year's show in Mexico City. And there's a good chance that similar tidbits await in this year's contest (held in Milan), highlights of which will be shown on USA Tuesday night at 9 -- and viewers will eat them up.</p>

        <p>SAY what you will about dog shows, but where else are you going to learn that the first officer of the Titanic had a Newfoundland on board? Not in that high-priced, dog-ignoring Leonardo DiCaprio movie, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>Viewers of the World Dog Show on the USA Network learned that item of canine history from last year's show in Mexico City. And there's a good chance that similar tidbits await in this year's contest (held in Milan), highlights of which will be shown on USA Tuesday night at 9 -- and viewers will eat them up.</p>
        <p>Dog shows are big ratings winners. New York's own Westminster competition is one of USA's top-ranked shows every February, and the World Dog Show -- lesser known but twice as large, with some 5,000 animal contestants -- did well in 1999. Even devoted dog lovers have to ask why.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it's our short attention span,'' says Gordon Beck, the network's senior vice president for sports and production. ''But you become just glued to the set. I think there's a fascination with the variety of dogs that are out there -- from Afghans to Westies -- and their personalities and images.'' Plus, as he points out, it's family entertainment, which has been hard to come by for a while now.</p>
        <p>There could be an attention span connection. Every minute or two there's a new champion to look at, a new breed, a new funny name on the screen (like Ch. Periwinkle Godzilla, an affenpinscher, or Ch. ''Garth Brooks,'' a cavalier King Charles spaniel, of all things), a new outrageous doggie hairdo, a new adorable or majestic walk. On the other hand, there's a definite sameness to it all: the parade of pets prancing by on their professional handlers' leashes (dog shows are one of television viewers' few opportunities to watch overweight people run), the droning voice of the announcer (''It is believed that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi arrived in Wales with Flemish weavers in the 12th century. The Corgi has enormous verve and charm and makes a very cheerful companion''), the studious pacing of the judge, the pointing and the final close-up of the proud winner -- sometimes drooling a little for the camera. But there's something soothing about those things. I imagine this is what watching golf on television must be like, for people who care.</p>
        <p>In fact the two-hour edited-highlights version of the World Dog Show may actually be a little too fast-paced and energetic for the genre's devotees. But the show has other assets, like its international flavor.</p>
        <p>One example of that is Ch. Suvikasteen Rollo, a 1999 competitor. Suvikasteen Rollo is a Mexican breed (smooth-coat Chihuahua), born and reared in Finland with Japanese owners. The terrier judge last year was from Croatia (he chose the Australian silky terrier, which would have been in the toy category in an American show). The Xoloitzcuintle (Xolo for short), another Mexican breed, was a big audience favorite. And the best-in-show ribbon went to a Belgian Tervuren -- who must have been a friend of the camera operator, because he won my heart with a winning close-up when he was named best of breed (mejor del grupo).</p>
        <p>These competitions are really beauty contests, after all. ''With everything in the sports world, there's a clear winner,'' says Mr. Beck, who goes home every night to his family's 4-year-old yellow Labrador retriever, Otis. ''But in a dog show, you don't know what that judge is looking for. One dog is not going to be judged fastest. There's a mystique.''</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, that first circling of the ring is a lot like a Miss American swimsuit competition -- who can really say which beauty is closest to perfection?</p>
        <p>Neverthelesss, the World Dog Show never hesitates to proclaim its annual winner the ''best dog OF the world.'' Some nerve. Everybody knows that title belongs to the aging but still adorable West Highland white terrier sleeping on my sofa.</p>
