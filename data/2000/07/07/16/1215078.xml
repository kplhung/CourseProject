        <p>It's hot. It's very hot. It seems way too hot for a slow-cooked meaty meal. But Claudette Eugene is cooking one anyway.</p>
        <p>''I cooked yesterday, I cook today, I will cook tomorrow,'' says the Haitian-born mother of 5 and grandmother of 10. ''I cook every day. The food never stays.''</p>
        <p>In Haiti, a cook learns to match the heat of the day with the chilies in a meal, to deploy bitter and sweet flavors against the languor of humidity. And a natural cook, like Eugene, intuits the culinary patois of Haiti, a blend of African, Spanish, French and British influences culled from tropical produce and spices like nutmeg, allspice and anato.</p>
        <p>Cook in the morning and people will come. Some will pick. Some will binge. Everyone will eat all evening long.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's the layering of flavor and spice that masks the heft of Haitian food. Or perhaps it's the serene purposefulness of a cook like Eugene, who infuses each dish with the joy of survival.</p>
        <p>Occupying the western half of the island of Hispaniola (the eastern half is the Dominican Republic), the Haitian landscape moves from mountainous peaks to fertile lowland. The area is as prone to drought as it was, historically, to conquest.</p>
        <p>Both conditions breed the sort of frugality that Eugene displays in her cooking, her shopping and her words, even after 31 years in the United States. The ingenuity to turn rough roots and scrawny cattle into tasty meals is another Haitian birthright.</p>
        <p>The kind of safety measures crucial in a tropical climate prompt the Haitian cook's habit of rinsing, marinating, rubbing, cooking and recooking. Seasoning is added at each stage, and the flavor of the dish grows incidentally more complex.</p>
        <p>''It's the healthy way to cook,'' Eugene says. In her no-nonsense patois she lists the Haitian way with various foods: all ingredients should be washed. Chicken and turkey should be washed in vinegar and salt and all of the fat removed. Pork should be scrubbed with lemon or sour (Seville) oranges. Beef can be rubbed with these as well as with lime.</p>
        <p>And yet something more than health simmers in each of the battered aluminum pots crowding the stove in her Brooklyn brownstone. A spirit that, for all her matter-of-factness, the 60-year-old Haitian cook is not unmindful of.</p>
        <p>Oh, she tries to present her economy of motion, her constant cleaning, as a life lesson. ''You see how I cook,'' she says. ''I am not sloppy. If you are sloppy, you can't do anything in your life.''</p>
        <p>Then, pushing her black knit ski cap up on her forehead and fidgeting with the rosary that hangs around her neck under her bright yellow T-shirt, she hints at an animism lurking beneath the practical in Haitian cooking.</p>
        <p>It's odd, she muses. ''When you cook, you only eat a little and feel satisfied. In a restaurant, you eat a lot and are still hungry.''</p>
        <p>Griot (Spicy Pork Shoulder)  (all recipes adapted from Claudette Eugene)</p>
        <p>4 1/2 pounds pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch stew pieces by your butcher</p>
        <p>7 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons lemon juice, the squeezed halves of 1 lemon reserved</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons lime juice, the squeezed halves of 1 lime reserved</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons hot sauce</p>
        <p>2 sprigs parsley</p>
        <p>1 scallion</p>
        <p>1/2 small green bell pepper, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons tomato paste</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/4 Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1/2 small carrot, peeled and thinly sliced.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl, combine the pork, 2 tablespoons of the vinegar, the lemon juice and 3 tablespoons of the lime juice and toss until well mixed. Rub the pork all over with the insides of the lemon and lime halves, then put the halves and 4 tablespoons of the vinegar into a pot of simmering water. Place the pork in a colander, rinse well under hot water, then add it to the pot and simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Place the colander in the sink, drain the pork and rinse well with hot water. Clean and dry the pot, return the pork to it and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon vinegar, remaining 1 tablespoon lime juice, the hot sauce, parsley, scallion, half of the bell pepper, the tomato paste and 2 cups water and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place over medium heat and cook, covered, for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <p>4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to a roasting pan and bake until well browned and tender, about 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Pour the cooking liquid from the pot into a small saucepan and remove the parsley and scallion. Add the remaining bell pepper, the onion, carrot and 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>6. Remove the pork from the oven, transfer to a serving platter and pour the cooking liquid over the pork. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Riz et Pois  (Rice and Beans)</p>
        <p>1/2 pound dried red beans</p>
        <p>8 whole cloves</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped</p>
        <p>Leaves from 1 sprig parsley, chopped</p>
        <p>1 scallion, chopped</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 14-ounce can coconut milk</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped, peeled Spanish onion</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon Goya-brand adobo seasoning</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons Picalese (see recipe)</p>
        <p>1/4 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>2 cups long-grain rice, rinsed</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Place the beans and cloves in a medium pot and cover with water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until very tender, about 1 hour. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid. Add enough water to the liquid to equal 4 cups total.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, parsley and scallion and mash into a paste.</p>
        <p>3. Heat the oil over high heat in a large kettle with a tight-fitting lid. Add the scallion paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add the beans, coconut milk and onion and cook, covered, for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the reserved liquid and the adobo and cook, covered, for 25 minutes. Stir in the Picalese and bell pepper and bring to a boil. Stir in the rice and cook, covered, until tender, about 25 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Crab, Beef and Okra Stew</p>
        <p>1 clove garlic, peeled and chopped</p>
        <p>Leaves from 2 sprigs parsley, chopped</p>
        <p>1 scallion, chopped</p>
        <p>2 pounds London broil, cut into slices 2 inches wide and  1/2inch thick</p>
        <p>Juice of 1 lemon, the squeezed halves reserved</p>
        <p>Juice of 1 lime, the squeezed halves reserved</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon hot sauce</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon Goya-brand adobo seasoning</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons tomato paste</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons Picalese (see recipe)</p>
        <p>4 hard-shelled blue crabs, apron and gills removed</p>
        <p>1 pound okra, ends trimmed</p>
        <p>1/2 Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced, plus 1 tablespoon finely chopped</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons butter.</p>
        <p>1. With a mortar and pestle, combine the garlic, parsley and scallion and mash into a paste.</p>
        <p>2. In a colander in the sink, rub the beef all over with the insides of the lemon and lime halves and rinse with hot water. Transfer the meat to a large bowl and toss with the scallion paste, lemon and lime juices, hot sauce and adobo and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>3. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until dark red, about 30 seconds. Add the beef mixture and Picalese and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add the crabs and 1 cup water and continue to cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Add the okra, onion, butter and 2 cups water and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until the okra is tender, about 10 minutes more.</p>
        <p>4. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Banana Pese  (Fried Green Plantains)</p>
        <p>Vegetable oil for frying</p>
        <p>3 green plantains, peeled, lightly scored and cut into 2-inch slices on the diagonal, peels reserved</p>
        <p>Kosher salt.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium saucepan, add oil to a depth of 2 inches and place over high heat. When the oil is very hot (a bread cube dropped into the oil will turn golden brown in 30 seconds), add the plantains and fry, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the plantains to a plate. Flatten one at a time between the plantain peels until about  1/4inch thick, then return to the oil and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, about 1 minute.</p>
        <p>2. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the plantains to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt to taste. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Picalese  (Pickled Chilies)</p>
        <p>12 habanero or Scotch bonnet chili peppers, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1/2 small Spanish onion, peeled and thinly sliced</p>
        <p>1 small carrot, peeled and thinly sliced</p>
        <p>Distilled white vinegar.</p>
        <p>In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, add the chilies, onion and carrot and enough vinegar to cover. Store in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks. Use to spice up soups, stews and rice dishes.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 jar.</p>
