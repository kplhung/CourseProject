        <p>To the Editor: I read ''Who Turned On the Noise?'' by Betsy Wade (June 4), and it reminded me of my trip to Costa Rica in mid-May.</p>
        <p>Although the trip was excellent, all things considered, certainly the low point was the two nights spent at Arenal Observatory Lodge, near the Arenal Volcano.

        <p>To the Editor: I read ''Who Turned On the Noise?'' by Betsy Wade (June 4), and it reminded me of my trip to Costa Rica in mid-May.</p>
        <p>Although the trip was excellent, all things considered, certainly the low point was the two nights spent at Arenal Observatory Lodge, near the Arenal Volcano. Construction was everywhere on the grounds, and, incredibly, they were using an electric saw to cut metal pipe for hand railings directly outside our room.</p>
        <p>Naturally, any opportunities for much-needed afternoon naps in our expensive room were out of the question.</p>
        <p>When I complained to the management, I was told that since we were staying in the off season, this was what we should have expected.</p>
        <p>ANDREW BROOKS  Forest Hills, Queens</p>
        <p>William Aspinall, general manager of Arenal Observatory Lodge, replies: We are upgrading our facilities, and we try to keep our noise level down to avoid disturbing our guests; we work near rooms from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. We have apologized in writing to Mr. Brooks; we have had no other complaints about this noise from other guests in the same building during this period.</p>
