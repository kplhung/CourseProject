        <p>Istanbul is not a violent city. There are remarkably few assaults or robberies in which guns or knives are used. Street crime usually takes a more subtle form.</p>
        <p>Pickpockets work in tourist areas, particularly around Taksim Square and the Galata Tower. Some are quite skilled, even able to grab wallets from front pockets. Often they use the bump technique, pretending to run for a bus or chase a friend and bumping into their victim. By the time the target realizes that the bump was no accident, a wallet or purse is gone.</p>

        <p>Istanbul is not a violent city. There are remarkably few assaults or robberies in which guns or knives are used. Street crime usually takes a more subtle form.</p>
        <p>Pickpockets work in tourist areas, particularly around Taksim Square and the Galata Tower. Some are quite skilled, even able to grab wallets from front pockets. Often they use the bump technique, pretending to run for a bus or chase a friend and bumping into their victim. By the time the target realizes that the bump was no accident, a wallet or purse is gone.</p>
        <p>On some streets, shoeshine boys will strike up a conversation to distract a mark while a partner picks his pocket. In fast-food restaurants at shopping malls, a young woman may approach a foreigner saying she wants to practice her English. This may be a diversion aimed at giving a partner the chance to grab a wallet or purse.</p>
        <p>There have been several reports of visitors' being given drinks mixed with a substance that makes them drowsy or even unconscious. When the victim begins to feel sick, he or she is relieved of money and other valuables. In another variation, a seemingly solicitous individual offers to take the woozy victim back to his or her hotel room, and then cleans out whatever valuables are there.</p>
        <p>One of the most common scams is actually legal. The victim either drifts into a bar or is steered to one by an apparently friendly fellow on a busy street like Istiklal Caddesi, the city's main pedestrian drag. Once there, he (this one is usually aimed at men) meets some other friendly folks, often female, who order drinks. The bill comes to several hundred dollars. Victims who are reluctant to pay find themselves surrounded by tough-looking characters who make paying seem like the wise course.</p>
        <p>The way to avoid this, according to the police, is to ask to see a price list before ordering a drink. If patrons do not do so, the host is entitled to charge even the most outrageous price. To complete the aura of legality, these bars scrupulously provide their victims with receipts for the total cost.</p>
