        <p>IT started years ago as a policy worked out by Westchester County and its correction officers on how to handle disability claims.</p>
        <p>A seven-page provision included in their contract gives officers the ability to state that they are injured -- and leave work with a full, nontaxable salary -- without first having to prove any injury.</p>
        <p>The county proposed the notion. The union embraced it. Now the county wants to do away with it.</p>
        <p>''It was a good-faith effort to help some men and women who I felt had a very difficult job and were easily injured because they were in immediate contact with inmates who sometimes don't care if they push you or shove you or what,'' said Andrew P. O'Rourke, who was Westchester's county executive when the clause was signed in March 1989.</p>
        <p>But ultimately, he said, ''It didn't work.''</p>
        <p>The road to the new injury policy began in 1986, when the county pulled out of the workers' compensation system of processing injury claims for correction officers, said Robert Goodstein, the lawyer for the Correction Officers Benevolent Association. He said the county felt that law judges under that system were favoring the officers in injury disputes and believed that if they formed a parallel procedure, with labor arbitrators, ''they would win more cases.''</p>
        <p>Michael W. Wittenberg, the county labor relations director at the time, characterized the workers' compensation system as backlogged and time consuming and said the county believed it would be better off using arbitrators to handle injury claims ''in-house.''</p>
        <p>So, in exchange for allowing the county to set hearing dates in cases where disputes might arise, Mr. Goodstein said he worked out an agreement under which officers would be paid immediately upon stating that they are disabled.</p>
        <p>Under state law, starting in 1984, officers already received full salary rather than at the limit set by workers' compensation, which is now $400 a week.</p>
        <p>In some other jurisdictions, officers who make a disability claim use their sick leave initially, and then if their claim is found valid, the expended sick leave is restored and substituted with disability pay.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, both sides agreed to the internal system in a contract that also included a 16 percent pay increase for the officers over two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wittenberg said that things went smoothly with the disability system until the early 1990's when the county's Board of Legislators voted to reject another proposed contract.</p>
        <p>The number of people out on job injury went from the low 40's on any given day to more than 100, he said.</p>
        <p>The clause, which he said was initially put in to resolve legitimate disputes for employees who have dangerous jobs, began to be ''manipulated, in my view, by employees who might not even have had injuries.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wittenberg added, ''The procedure has been so skewed in their benefit that we have not been able to get them back to work.''</p>
        <p>In the early 90's, however, there were more officers on the job overall than in the late 1980's, meaning a greater distribution of overtime. And, Mr. Goodstein said, the county adopted the policy ''with their eyes wide open.'' He said the officers deserve the policy as a guarantee in a tough job. Michael Adams, the head of the correction officers union in Nassau County on Long Island, said he wished his ranks had such a clause.</p>
        <p>To Hans Toch, a professor of criminal justice at SUNY Albany, the situation at the jail resembles a ''parent-child game.''</p>
        <p>''In the ideal world, what is needed is a collaborative, open, honest approach,'' Mr. Toch said. ''The business of suspecting that everyone who is sick might be cheating or trying to rip off the employer only leads to an acrimonious dispute. It leads to a game of evasion. There must be horror stories they tell on both sides.''</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Rourke said: ''It wouldn't be the first time a good idea has gone astray.''</p>
