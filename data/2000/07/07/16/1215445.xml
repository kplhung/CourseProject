      <abstract>
        <p>Survey of 897 consumers whose household income is in top 25 percent nationally finds that 92 percent have home computers and 75 percent have Internet access, but only 3 percent have used Internet for any financial purpose and only 12 percent have made investment or bought a financial product online (M)</p>

        <p>The image of the wired investor happily tracking investments on a laptop computer and making real-time trades from a beach chair is a familiar conceit in TV commercials. Finding such a creature in the wild appears to be much harder, judging by some recent surveys.</p>
        <p>The Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the professional organization that issues the C.F.P. licenses, surveyed 897 consumers whose household income is in the top 25 percent nationally, and found that while 92 percent had home computers and three-quarters had Internet access, just 36 percent used the Internet for any financial purpose and only 12 percent had made an investment or bought a financial product online.</p>
        <p>A broader survey, covering Americans at all income levels and sponsored by Scudder Kemper Investments, found that only 6 percent had ever bought or sold stocks over the Internet. Slightly more than half of this survey's respondents said they had too little information on how to make sound savings and investment decisions. About half said following developments in the stock market and the economy was more important than ever, but an astonishing 82 percent said they had never read about or even heard of the new economy.</p>
