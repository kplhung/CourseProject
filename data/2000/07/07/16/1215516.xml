        <p>The spooky bushes that used to swallow Martina Navratilova's wayward lobs had been cleared away, and the wall that absorbed the backhands she belted with her grandmother's heavy wood racket was gone.</p>
        <p>But almost everything else was the same. So when the 43-year-old Navratilova stepped on the courts tucked away in the countryside of the Czech Republic just this past month, it was as if she tripped the door on a time capsule containing the first shreds of evidence to her improbable journey.</p>
        <p>Somehow, the vulnerable lefty who had the courage to flee a Communist country, the fearlessness to face scrutiny by coming out and a drive that changed the physical image of the female athlete was standing on a manicured lawn at the Tennis Museum and Hall of Fame today as an inductee from the class of 2000. Before she served and volleyed her way to 18 Grand Slam singles titles, before she supplied the contrast that turned her rivalry with Chris Evert into folklore, there was a bare beginning.</p>
        <p>''We used to have to fix the courts in the spring,'' Navratilova said.  ''That was our membership dues. We'd spend about 20 hours pulling the weeds and putting the clay on, etc.</p>
        <p>''My mother and father met through me. When my father would take the clay to the court in the wheelbarrow, I would get in the wheelbarrow and he'd wheel me down. I was about 3 years old then. He liked me because I was smiling and so happy -- of course I was happy because he gave me a ride -- but that's how my parents met. So tennis not only brought my parents together, but then my parents being together brought me to tennis. It's a big circle.''</p>
        <p>In a way, that circle included her fellow inductees. There was Judge Robert Kelleher, who grew tired of the payments being made under the table to players and fought for the approval of Open tennis in 1968. There was also Malcolm Anderson, who came off a cattle ranch in Australia to become a force on his country's Davis Cup team and was the first unseeded player to win the United States National singles title, in 1957.</p>
        <p>Through longevity and circumstance, all three are linked. In 1974  Navratilova played mixed doubles with Anderson. In 1981 she became a United States citizen in the same Los Angeles federal court over which Kelleher presided. With Billie Jean King's former husband, Larry, as her lawyer, Navratilova went through naturalization with 50 others from all backgrounds. The six-year wait after her defection was over.</p>
        <p>''There was no decision,'' Navratilova said before the induction ceremony. ''If I wanted to play tennis, I had to leave the country. The difficult part was doing it. I was 19, young and didn't think about the consequences to do it. I had to make the choice. And what I regret the most is that I had to make that choice and that I can never have those years back with my sister, with my parents, with my grandmother. If I wanted to play tennis, I had to do it. Once I got out, I knew I couldn't go back.''</p>
        <p>She just pushed forward with some help along the way. The same year she became a citizen, she also had an epiphany induced by Nancy Lieberman-Cline. If she wanted to find an edge, she'd have to do what no other woman had done at the time: live in the gym.</p>
        <p>''I remember going to the French Open the first year,'' said Lieberman-Cline, who attended the ceremony today. ''And I was thinking when we got back to the hotel, and then I asked Martina, 'When are you going to practice?' And she said, 'Well, I just did.' I went, 'You got to be kidding me. You call that practice? You hit the ball for 15 minutes, you talk to Billie Jean, you wave to someone else, you hit an overhead and then we went back to the hotel. No wonder you don't win all the time. Your practice habits stink.' ''</p>
        <p>With prodding from Lieberman-Cline, Navratilova began to carve out a fit physique never seen on a female tennis player before. A month or so later, Dr. Renee Richards began sculpting Navratilova's game as her coach. As Navratilova developed her game, the riveting rivalry between herself and Evert evolved.</p>
        <p>''It was wonderful to be one half of the greatest rivalry in sports,'' Navratilova said. ''You may have team rivalries, but as for players, I can think of Ali and Frazier, but how many times did they fight? Three? We had 80 battles in singles. We made each other better.''</p>
        <p>Navratilova's impact on the game still resonates -- fitness is not an option for players anymore -- but what has separated her from so many other athletes today is her attention to activism. Although her honesty about her homosexuality has cost her millions of dollars in endorsements, her conviction is unwavering as she continues to speak out on gay and lesbian issues.</p>
        <p>''It's important,'' Navratilova said. ''And I think every piece of legislation is important. Until there is equal protection and equal rights, I'll keep speaking out. I don't want it to be an issue, but it is because we don't have the equal rights. It's something I couldn't even talk about until I became a citizen. It was a disqualifier to getting my citizenship. It shouldn't be that way.''</p>
        <p>She is serious when she speaks. But she also prompted more laughs than anything else today. When she addressed the crowd, she said, ''It's nice to be able to talk about yourself without feeling guilty or without having to pay somebody to listen to you.''</p>
        <p>When she thanked everyone who had helped her in her career, she also added a thanks to all the ''doctors who held me together, homeopathic people, osteopaths, massage therapists, and I'd like to thank my dogs for keeping me company throughout my career, even all the girlfriends who suffered through all the matches in the stands -- wherever they are.''</p>
        <p>Today she was surrounded by those who have always stood by her, her doubles partner, Pam Shriver; Lieberman-Cline; Dr. Richards; and her mother, Jana.</p>
        <p>''I'm so happy,'' Jana said. ''To be here, it's such a long way from where she started.''</p>
