        <p>It's rare that Garry Kasparov fails to win first prize, but it happened in the Fujitsu Siemens Giants Tournament in Frankfurt, June 22 to June 25.</p>
        <p>In this elite competition with a quick-play time limit of all moves in 25 minutes, Viswanathan Anand was in his element. The quick-thinking Indian grandmaster took first place with a 7 1/2-2 1/2 score. It was the third time he had won this double-round tournament.</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Anand was at his best in his game with Alexei Shirov, a grandmaster who lives in Spain, in the ninth round. A whirlwind mating attack was his weapon.</p>
        <p>The Steinitz Variation of the French Defense, 4 e5, avoids the early exchange of pieces that can arise from 4 Bg5 de 5 Ne4 Be7 6 Bf6 gf (or 6 . . . Bf6). It also sidesteps the challenging MacCutcheon Variation with 4 Bg5 Bb4.</p>
        <p>However, after 4 . . . Nfd7, Steinitz used to favor 5 f4 c5 6 Nf3 Nc6 7 Be3, although lately Black has made a living with 7 . . . cd 8 Nd4 Bc5 9 Qd2 Nd4 10 Bd4 Bd4 11 Qd4 Qb6 12 Qb6 Nb6.</p>
        <p>That may be one reason why there is a small return to the build-up of a massive pawn center with 5 Nce2 c5 6 c3 Nc6 7 f4. Long considered too slow-paced, it has lately been taken up by Anand and a few followers.</p>
        <p>A month ago in Leon, Spain, these two players contested the same opening through 7 Be3, when the play diverged with 7 . . . b5 8 a3 cd 9 Nd4 Nd4 10 cd b4 11 a4 Qa5 12 Bd2 Be7 13 Nf3 O-O 14 Bb5 Nb6 15 b3 Ba6 16 Ba6 Qa6 17 a5 Nd7 18 Qe2 Nb8 19 Kf2 Qe2 20 Ke2. Anand brilliantly converted his space advantage into victory in the endgame.</p>
        <p>After 8 . . . Be7, a Lalic-Speelman game in Hastings at the turn of the year gave a positional advantage to White after 9 g3 a5 10 h4 a4 11 Bh3, but Speelman had a deeper grasp of the situation and later won cleverly.</p>
        <p>There was no rush for Shirov to castle and give away the location of his king with 9 . . . O-O. He could have kept his powder dry with 9 . . . a5.</p>
        <p>Instead of 11 . . . a5, Shirov played 11 . . . Na5; after 12 b4 cb 13 ab Nc4, Shirov had a nice outpost for his queen knight. Anand owned the rest of the board.</p>
        <p>Perhaps after 17 . . . Bg5 Shirov had hoped for 18 hg?!, when he could barricade his king position with 18 . . . Nf8. But Anand's 18 Qg5! was another matter altogether.</p>
        <p>Anand's killing maneuver was 21 Bc4! dc 22 b5!, which put his queen bishop decisively into the fray after 22 . . . Qb5 23 Ba3!</p>
        <p>Anand's 25 Rg6! hg 26 Qg6 Kh8 27 Qf7 Rg8 28 Bf8! settled matters. If 28 . . . Nf8, then 29 Nf6 forces mate. Shirov gave up.</p>
