        <p>THIS year may be remembered for its extraordinary pink and creamy white bloom of mountain laurel. Any drive, especially along Interstate 95 or the Merritt Parkway,  provided an abundant view of the indigenous plant that is the Connecticut state flower.</p>
        <p>''I've only seen two or three years that compare with this one,'' said Richard A. Jaynes, 65, author of  ''Kalmia: Mountain Laurel and Related Species'' (Timber Press, 1997). It's definitely one of the best,'' he said. Mr. Jaynes attributed the spectacular bloom, which occurs from late May to late June, to the severity of last year's drought.</p>
        <p>''Mountain laurel like many other plants, when confronted with extreme drought-stress conditions will focus its energies into reproduction, into seed formation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jaynes also said the view was enhanced along I-95 and the Merritt Parkway because the state Department of Transportation did a particularly aggressive brush clearing along those roads, allowing the plants more sun and breathing room.</p>
        <p>Glenn Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum, said there was enough rainfall last year to keep the bud formation strong.</p>
        <p>''We also experienced a very mild winter,'' Mr. Dreyer said. ''During very cold winters, and years with early fall and late spring frosts, many flower buds formed the previous summer succumb, so the full potential of the blooming is reduced. My guess is that very few flower buds were damaged over winter, and combined with a moist spring, we are seeing close to the full potential of bloom.''</p>
        <p>Mountain laurel, an evergreen shrub that is part of the heath family, can bloom into July in the cooler, more northern parts of the state, Mr. Jaynes said. ''It's hard to predict when there will be a notable flowering of mountain laurel, but you can safely predict that next year will be a poor year,'' said Mr. Jaynes, who was a plant scientist for 25 years at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven.</p>
        <p>''Next year all of the plants' energies will be focused on the seed capsules. Little energy will go into flowering growth,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''For the mountain laurel to look this spectacular for this kind of profuse flowering you need a rare convergence of favorable conditions and circumstances,'' Mr. Dreyer said.</p>
