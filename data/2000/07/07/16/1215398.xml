        <p>FOR months before John Kim and Jodi Della Femina actually spoke, he saw her around London Terrace, the Tudor-style apartment complex in Manhattan, where they lived across the hall from each other. He knew her by sound as much as by sight. He could hear her coming and going with her constant companions, Chester and Henry, two mutts who growled and barked constantly and had the disgruntled temperaments of the dogs in George Booth's New Yorker cartoons. Mr. Kim, 32, thought of her as ''the cute girl with the crazy dogs.''</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1997, Mr. Kim asked Ray, their night elevator operator, whether Ms. Della Femina had a boyfriend. ''He told me: 'There's this blond man who comes up all the time. He's in perfect shape, model quality. And he has keys to her apartment.' ''</p>

        <p>FOR months before John Kim and Jodi Della Femina actually spoke, he saw her around London Terrace, the Tudor-style apartment complex in Manhattan, where they lived across the hall from each other. He knew her by sound as much as by sight. He could hear her coming and going with her constant companions, Chester and Henry, two mutts who growled and barked constantly and had the disgruntled temperaments of the dogs in George Booth's New Yorker cartoons. Mr. Kim, 32, thought of her as ''the cute girl with the crazy dogs.''</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1997, Mr. Kim asked Ray, their night elevator operator, whether Ms. Della Femina had a boyfriend. ''He told me: 'There's this blond man who comes up all the time. He's in perfect shape, model quality. And he has keys to her apartment.' ''</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Della Femina was completely single. The blond man was a friend of a friend and took care of Ms. Della Femina's apartment when she wasn't there.</p>
        <p>She was 29 at the time, a freelance writer and graduate of Tulane University, and she was feeling edgy about turning 30 without a serious love in her life. ''We both really wanted to find someone before 30,'' Robert Marlin, a running partner and confidant, remembered. ''It was like a line in the sand.''</p>
        <p>Friends describe Ms. Della Femina as someone who loves marathon phone conversations and beach bonfires, who is down to earth, yet extravagant. If she has two friends over for dinner, she cooks for 20. She works on a dozen things at once, including short stories and ''Jodi's Shortcuts 2000: The Hamptons,'' an annual guide covering subjects like hidden back roads and the best sushi on Long Island's East End.</p>
        <p>She spends weekends at the East Hampton home of her father, the advertising executive Jerry Della Femina, and stepmother, Judy Licht, a television reporter. ''Ours is an ancestral family home in the making,'' Mr. Della Femina said. Ms. Licht added, ''Unfortunately, it's sort of depressing when you're the ancestors.''</p>
        <p>In early 1998, weeks before Ms. Della Femina's 30th birthday, Ray, the elevator man, passed on the news that Mr. Kim had a crush on her. Surprised and interested, she wrote Mr. Kim a note saying she would like to go out with him sometime and slipped it under his door.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim, who was raised in Wayzata, Minn., is an investment banker, a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business School. He is known to his friends as dry-witted and understated in everything except his guitar playing. He telephoned her and introduced himself in an honest, matter-of-fact way: ''I said, 'Hi, I'm your neighbor from across the hall, and I'm interested in you.' ''</p>
        <p>They went to dinner -- without her dogs.</p>
        <p>''She was so sweet and nice, almost Midwestern,'' Mr. Kim, now a vice president at Chase Securities in Manhattan, remembered. Soon, she was hanging out in his apartment almost every night, as if they were best friends in a college dorm.</p>
        <p>''It became very familiar very fast,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Basically, her apartment just became a doghouse.''</p>
        <p>Months after they met, she took him to her father's house. ''The first thing I thought was, This is a really nice place, but it would be a lot better if it was on a lake,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Growing up in Minnesota, I'm a lake guy.''</p>
        <p>On July 8, they were married on the beach outside the Della Femina house, where the bride walked down a seashell-lined path in the sand with her mother, Barbara Della Femina, and her father. The couple took their vows before a sand ''altar'' made by Gerald A. Lynas, a sculptor, who created large sand mounds carved with wave and seashell motifs and decorated with real starfish.</p>
        <p>Watching the couple pose for photographs afterward, the bride's father said: ''It's the ultimate New York love story. People live these isolated, strange lives where they don't know anyone around them. It's a world where people are brought together by their elevator men.''</p>
