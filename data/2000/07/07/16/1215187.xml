        <p>WHAT did you say?'' my friend shouted.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I can't hear you,' '' I bellowed back, my voice hoarse from yelling for the previous hour.</p>

        <p>WHAT did you say?'' my friend shouted.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I can't hear you,' '' I bellowed back, my voice hoarse from yelling for the previous hour.</p>
        <p>No, we were not out sailing, trying to be heard above the howl of the wind and waves. Neither were we at the N.B.A. finals, cheering on the Lakers (or the Pacers), nor in Times Square on New Year's Eve.</p>
        <p>We were ending what we had thought would be a quiet, conversational dinner in one of Connecticut's smart new restaurants. Instead, we had strained to be heard above a decibel level best described as deafening. Later, my friend asked, ''Why do restaurants let that happen?''</p>
        <p>That is a question that friends, acquaintances and readers have asked repeatedly over the past few years. ''Why are so many new restaurants so impossibly noisy?'' It isn't aways by accident, I soon discovered.</p>
        <p>Alice Yiu, of a New York firm specializing in restaurant design said, ''Some restaurants think that sound creates excitement, buzz.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Yiu was in charge of the interior design at Baang Cafe and Bar in Riverside, which was one of the first, and perhaps most avant-garde, of the stylish new Fairfield County restaurants to open in recent years. It was also one of the noisier ones.</p>
        <p>''The decision to be loud or not is driven by the client,'' Ms. Yiu said. ''In the case of Baang, they wanted to create an Asian fusion restaurant with an open kitchen and a boisterous environment, like the bustle and sounds of a Chinese kitchen. Any designer can create ways to absorb sound, if that's what a client wants.''</p>
        <p>Les Blomberg, executive director of Noise Pollution Clearing House, nonprofit organization in Montpelier, Vt., said that in many ways, noise in a restaurant is like secondhand smoke.</p>
        <p>''A person who didn't create it, still suffers from it,'' Mr. Blomberg said.</p>
        <p>''The people who suffer most from excessive noise in a restaurant are the workers, because they are subject to it all day long,'' he continued. ''For them it can be a hearing-loss issue. For most diners, it's less that than, though it could cause higher blood pressure levels and stress-related effects. There's enough stress in society as it is. A restaurant should be an oasis from the other noises all around us.''</p>
        <p>One way to keep sound under control, Ms. Yiu said, is with fabric-wrapped ceiling or wall panels. ''That's what we did in Vong, in New York,'' she said. ''But we have to know about the paneling system at the beginning of a job. So we tell a client the space will be noisy if we do the job one way, quieter another way. It's the client's call.''</p>
        <p>Splash in Westport, with the same owner and designer as at Baang, is even more cacophonous. As Ms. Yiu said, ''it all depends on the kind of crowd you want. Younger people want excitement, older ones want conversation.'' So the restaurateur determines his target market and decorates accordingly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yiu, like other architects and designers interviewed, cited many ways excessive noise can be modified.</p>
        <p>''Anything fabric-related helps. Tablecloths, thick fabric upholstery on the chairs -- we did that in Vong -- carpeting of course, with padding. But when you have marble tabletops and floors, Sheetrock ceiling and walls, the sound keeps bouncing.''</p>
        <p>Putting foam soundproofing under tables and chair seats is another way to reduce noise, said Steven Rosstad, vice president of systems engineering with United States Communications in Westport.</p>
        <p>Allan Smardin, a sound specialist with HMB Acoustics in Trumbull, said that, ''A certain amount of square footage must be covered to improve the acoustic environment and deaden sound. The easiest way to do it is off the architectural plans. It is costlier and more difficult later.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smardin mentioned a Westport restaurateur who discovered the hard-edge look was a mistake, ''but because of the configuration of the rooms, it would have cost more than he wanted to pay to redo the place.''</p>
        <p>Sole in New Canaan, one of the most visually stunning of the newer restaurants, is also one of the loudest. Yet Frederick Brush, the New Canaan architectural designer who did the interior, as well as those at sister restaurants Terra and Le Figaro in Greenwich and Acqua in Westport, said there is acoustical padding underneath the Sole tables, to help minimize the sound. Even so, by most accounts, the decibel level is daunting.</p>
        <p>''What makes Sole noisy,'' Mr. Brush said, ''is that it's done in the European style. Europeans like noisy restaurants, so no one else can overhear their conversations. People get used to the noise. In restaurant design, we're trying to put you in a different world.''</p>
        <p>That is what appeals to so many in their 20's and 30's. As Anne-Marie Nordgren of Waccabuc, N. Y., put it: ''I'm big on atmosphere. If a place is too quiet, people can listen in on your conversation. I like Sole because it's fun and exciting. Over all, noise doesn't bother me. The only noise that does is if someone at the next table is being obstreperous or a child next to me is screaming. A place like Mirabella in Ridgefield, with big open space and a lively bar with people moving in and out, is noisy but a fun place to be. Lexington Square Cafe in Mount Kisco is also bustling, open to a second level, with an oyster bar integrated into the restaurant area.''</p>
        <p>Those a few years older often feel differently. Jan Trifero of New Canaan said that when she and her husband go out to dinner they look for ''a casual place like Cafe Milano in Norwalk for after the movies or a place to go with another couple, something a little hip.''</p>
        <p>''Inferno in Westport and Ocean Drive in South Norwalk,'' Ms. Trifero said, ''are fun because if you sit in the upper level you can always converse. We also like River Cat Grill in Rowayton where a foursome can hear one another talk. I love the look and style of some of the new places, but so many are so loud we go once and never go back.''</p>
        <p>Not all the smart newer restaurants with hard surfaces are audio-challenged. Mediterranean Grill in Wilton, with its tile flooring, would seem to be a candidate for a thunderous sound level; it is lively but not ear-splitting, however. Jose Formosa, an owner, credits the well-spaced tables and curtains.</p>
        <p>''We space the tables for 70 people; we could squeeze in 100,'' Mr. Formosa said, ''but the sound would be deafening. People would come once, then never again. We'd rather make 70 people happy and have them return.''</p>
        <p>Frederick Hoag, of F. W. H. Architects in Westport, and the interior designer Jean-Baptiste Ducret, designed Mediterranean Grill, as well as Meson Galicia in Norwalk. ''In Med Grill,'' Mr. Hoag said, ''to control the sound, we used acoustical tiles in the ceiling. The client wanted an open kitchen, so we deadened the sound with a decorative architectural element, called a soffit, that dropped the ceiling above the counter that separates the kitchen from the dining area. The soffit serves as a barrier to the clatter and heat of the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>Conversely, Mr. Hoag continued, mentioning another place that is part of the same restaurant group, ''Pika Tapas in New Haven was a tapas bar, intended to attract a young, college crowd, so they wanted a noisier, more exciting ambience.''</p>
        <p>But not overpoweringly so, he said. So Mr. Hoag raised the ceiling, then lowered it around the beams, to blunt the sound a bit. In Kazu, a Japanese restaurant in South Norwalk, ''a Sheetrock ceiling was essential for fire separation,'' he said, ''but we painted it black, which had an acoustical quality, then suspended linear baffles treated with gold leaf to muffle sound and provide a visual element. The sound gets lost up there and the look is bigger and acoustically great.''</p>
        <p>The brand-new Ocean Drive in South Norwalk seems to have solved the noise problem while achieving a cool, hip look. Bruce Beinfield of Beinfield Wagner Architects, who, with Jonathan Wagner, designed the restaurant, described how this was done.</p>
        <p>''The entire ceiling was soundboard,'' Mr. Beinfield said, ''one-inch insulation painted black, which gave a stagy character and controlled the noise. It's the same product used in mechanical ducts. Fabric helped too, like the curtains at the individual cabana-like booths.''</p>
        <p>At Miramar in Westport, which Beinfield Wagner also designed, ''we used acoustical plaster on the ceiling and fabric on the walls,'' Mr. Beinfield said. ''The difference between Ocean Drive and Miramar and some other restaurants is that we aggressively approached the sound problem at the beginning, instead of ignoring it. Once a restaurant opens, the sound problem can't be ignored.''</p>
        <p>Another chic new restaurant where the sound level seems under control is Zinc in New Haven, which manages to be lively, but not headache-provoking. ''I wanted a sleek, modern look, with good lighting, a place that would create a buzz,'' said the owner, Donna Curran. She said she knew she needed upholstery and carpeting to deaden the sound, having been involved in decorating the cafe at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.</p>
        <p>''In Zinc's private dining area in the rear,'' Ms. Curran said, ''we built a false wall covered with fabric and put mattress padding under the fabric. It really was effective in preventing echoes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoag also observed that ''a lot of times designers get involved in the aesthetic quality of materials and forget the acoustical quality. For a restaurant, it all comes down to whether you want a lively bar-type atmosphere with a younger crowd or whether you want conversation.''</p>
        <p>It shouldn't have to be either/or. Few people going out to dinner deliberately seek a restaurant of morgue-like silence. At the same time, most people beyond the swinging-singles stage enjoy talking along with dining, and many of them enjoy visually stimulating decor as well.</p>
        <p>''Sound control is not rocket science,'' said Bennett Brooks, the chairman of the Technical Committee on Noise of the Acoustical Society of America. Mr. Brooks is a noise control engineer in Vernon.</p>
        <p>''Any restaurateur who is aware of a noise problem, and is willing to address it, can do something,'' he said. ''But often they just let it go. Eventually, down the road, if restaurant noise persists, this may become an issue that the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board will address under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. There have been cases around the country of employees putting in OSHA claims.''</p>
        <p>He said there have been no such claims in Connecticut.</p>
