        <p>In an electoral system hooked on ever-larger fixes of cash, they were not asking for much. But it was still surprising to see politicians and former politicians getting practically misty-eyed over campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>They were Republicans, too.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Tom Kean, State Senator William L. Gormley and Essex County Executive James W. Treffinger were telling a receptive Assembly committee at a hearing at Drew University last week that the often-mysterious organizations behind some campaign attack ads should be required to disclose their expenditures and donors.</p>
        <p>It was a step taken by Congress last month. And now, after a handful of primary campaigns remarkable for their ugliness, New Jersey legislators are trying to do the same thing in races for state office. They are seeing what it's like to be clawed by unidentified forces.</p>
        <p>Some have been burned quite personally. Assemblyman Joel Weingarten, a co-sponsor of the bill before the committee, was attacked in the Republican primary in the Seventh Congressional District this spring.</p>
        <p>''We had an outside organization, the principals of which remain nameless, besmirching my reputation and that of other candidates in the race while leaving one candidate unscathed,'' the Assemblyman said.</p>
        <p>The group, the conservative, Virginia-based Council for Responsible Government, is among a growing number of ''stealth PACs,'' or ''527'' organizations, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that allows them to spend unlimited sums for political causes without any disclosure, as long as they do not explicitly urge a vote for or against anyone. This is called ''issue advocacy.''</p>
        <p>With names that sound commendable, like Citizens for Tax Reform, these groups finance ads that make Harry and Louise, stars of the 1993-94 Congressional campaign, look buoyant. What the ads say may be true, or true in a way, or not true by any rational interpretation.</p>
        <p>Typically, the ads talk about Social Security or pollution or the like, in a voice ranging from funereal to bitter. Without endorsing Candidate A, the voice says Candidate B is a dangerous person.</p>
        <p>Upon investigation, it usually turns out that Candidate A, who takes no responsibility for the damage, was somehow involved.</p>
        <p>While declining to identify a Candidate A in his congressional race (for the record, the unscathed one was Mike Ferguson, the winner), Assemblyman Weingarten described one ad: ''It went, 'Joel Weingarten supported tax increases when he was a councilman in Millburn, and taxes went up x percent.' ''</p>
        <p>He did support some increases, Mr. Weingarten said, and taxes did go up x percent. But he did not vote for the county and school taxes that accounted for the x percent increase. In any event, he said: ''Is that issue advocacy? Or is that telling you not to vote for me?''</p>
        <p>Ads like this are proliferating. Ingrid W. Reed of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers said legislators and party leaders were disconcerted by the ''nasty, disrespectful, misleading, inferential ads'' in this year's primaries.</p>
        <p>At Wednesday's hearing, Mr. Kean, a man not given to outrage, said the 527s were ''termites getting at the roots of this democracy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean, who as president of Drew was host for the hearing, did not mention in testimony but acknowledged later that he was moved by the fight in the Seventh District -- in which Tom Kean Jr. was a victim.</p>
        <p>''When it happens to your family, it makes it larger than life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Senator Gormley, an Atlantic County Republican, said that ''when my name in their ad is mentioned 23 times in a negative way, that's not issue advocacy.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gormley said stealth PAC's did not figure in the recent race for the United States Senate nomination, which he lost, he recalled the National Rifle Association's campaign against him in 1991. The organization at first denied involvement and then ''admitted it 45 days later,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley co-sponsored the Senate version of the bill before the committee hearing, which would withhold public financing from a gubernatorial candidate ''involved in any way'' with a 527 unless it disclosed all donors and contributions. Mr. Weingarten has also introduced a bill to compel disclosure from 527's that mention any candidate in an ad. Similar proposals sponsored by Senators William E. Schluter and John H. Adler and Assemblywoman Linda R. Greenstein would make an offending candidate guilty of an ethics violation.</p>
        <p>The proposals do not go very far, considering the soft money flowing from other nonprofits and PAC's, which work directly for candidates, and from the parties themselves. And many 527 groups, like the American Cancer Society's, are already public.</p>
        <p>But suddenly the political parties have realized that they are losing control to assorted zealots, and suddenly everyone has a good-government issue.</p>
        <p>''Who ever thought Bill Gormley would be a champion of campaign finance reform?'' said Senator Adler, a Cherry Hill Democrat.</p>
        <p>Senator Adler, among others, says Senator Gormley is tweaking the Senate president, Donald DiFrancesco, who will likely run for governor next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley has been mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate himself, though he wont say a word. And Mr. DiFrancesco was less than helpful to Mr. Gormley in the recent campaign. And Mr. Gormley has a long memory. But that's another story.</p>
