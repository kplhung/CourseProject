        <p>Gold-plated corporate earnings and a tame inflation report gave Wall Street something to cheer about last week -- especially those investors with a hankering for technology.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many beaten-down Internet and computer companies, jumped 222.98, to 4,246.18, its highest finish in more than three months. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 176.77, at 10,812.75.</p>

        <p>Gold-plated corporate earnings and a tame inflation report gave Wall Street something to cheer about last week -- especially those investors with a hankering for technology.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many beaten-down Internet and computer companies, jumped 222.98, to 4,246.18, its highest finish in more than three months. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 176.77, at 10,812.75.</p>
        <p>Technology represents the most dynamic potential growth area in this economy, said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist for A. G. Edwards &amp; Company in St. Louis. By buying tech, investors are showing renewed confidence in the outlook for the economy.</p>
        <p>Analysts believe the Federal Reserve is finished with raising interest rates for the time being, as the economy has shown signs of slowing and wholesale inflation appeared to be under control in June, according to government data.</p>
        <p>Among last week's winners were technology companies that reported strong quarterly earnings, like Motorola and Altera.Financial stocks also fared well, including J. P. Morgan, which reported strong quarterly profits.</p>
