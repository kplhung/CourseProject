        <p>Dr. Diana Vines Perry and William Reading Gilson Jr. were married yesterday at Our Lady of the Snows Catholic Church in Woodstock, Vt. The Rev. William P. Gallagher performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perry, 31, grew up in Houston, one of 10 children of Dr. Levi V. Perry, a cardiologist, and Dr. Eula F. Perry, a pediatrician who is now retired. The bride, who as a 10-year-old listened to heart murmurs in her father's office and held babies in her mother's, is now the associate director of the Special Care Nursery at the North Shore Children's Medical Center in Salem, Mass. She is also an attending neonatologist at Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's Hospitals in Boston. The bride, a graduate of Skidmore College and the Boston University School of Medicine, received a master's degree in public health from Harvard in June.</p>
        <p>She met Mr. Gilson, who is 38 and known as Gilly, on a blind date in 1997. He teaches the fifth grade at the Benjamin Banneker Charter School in Cambridge, Mass. He is a graduate of Middlebury College and received a master's degree in education from Harvard and another in special education from Simmons College. He is the son of Charlotte Renard Gilson of Chatham, N.J., and the late Mr. Gilson Sr., a lawyer who practiced in Summit, N.J.</p>
        <p>The couple's first date went so well that Dr. Perry brought up the ''M word'' at the end of dinner. ''I just thought he was the smartest man I'd ever met,'' she remembered. ''We had a mutual interest in African-American history and in helping children get ready for the future. I said, 'Gilly, you seem like a very, very special man, and I have a feeling that someday I am going to marry you.' Then both of us laughed.''</p>
        <p>Soon after that, he invited her to his mother's summer house in West Windsor, Vt., and introduced her to cross-country skiing, crampons, ice hiking and his own special style of sledding.</p>
        <p>''Once, he took me hiking up the ski slopes, and then we came sliding down all of the slopes on our backpacks by the moonlight,'' she said. ''That was the most romantic and crazy thing I have ever done in my life, and I fell in love with him that night.''</p>
        <p>When he first took her out cross-country skiing, it was snowing and getting dark, and at one point, she fell down and became tangled in some branches. Nevertheless, the bridegroom remembered, she seemed to love it.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'This is the woman for me,' '' Mr. Gilson said. ''She can go skiing in the middle of a snowstorm at night and actually enjoy falling into an evergreen tree.''</p>
