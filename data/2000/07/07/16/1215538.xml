        <p>Dashing the hopes of thousands of scientists gathered in Durban, South Africa, for the 13th International Aids Conference, President Thabo Mbeki singled out extreme poverty, rather than AIDS, as the biggest killer in Africa. Mr. Mbeki has stirred a furor by entertaining the theory that poverty, not the H.I.V. virus, causes AIDS -- an argument most scientists say was debunked years ago. No one disputes the link between poverty and AIDS. But many scientists fear that Mr. Mbeki's comments will fuel confusion among ordinary people who may assume they can continue risky sexual behavior because the president has questioned whether H.I.V. causes AIDS.</p>
