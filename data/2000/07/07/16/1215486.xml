        <p>Continuing his assault on Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas, Vice President Al Gore presented his own economic proposals today as ''tried and true,'' while Governor Bush, he said, had made a ''mess'' in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was addressing his ideological soul mates here at a convention of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist organization that he helped found 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>Recalling that he had helped write the news release announcing the formation of the group, Mr. Gore described its mission as similar to that of his presidential campaign today: to help the nation to escape the clutches of special interests, which, he said, had dragged it into recession and deficits when the Republicans were in charge.</p>
        <p>''That's the true legacy of the Bush-Quayle years,'' Mr. Gore said, in his episodic effort to link Mr. Bush, his likely Republican rival, with Mr. Bush's father's presidency, which was rejected by the voters in 1992.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to see us dragged back to the tired old thinking that nearly destroyed the American dream,'' Mr. Gore said, saying that his proposed tax cuts for specific purposes like health care and education were preferable to across-the-board income-tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has proposed $500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years. Mr. Bush has proposed $1.3 trillion in income-tax cuts over 10 years, which, Mr. Gore said, would bring the current prosperity to ''a screeching halt.''</p>
        <p>If tax cuts run slightly counter to the Democratic Leadership Council orthodoxy, Mr. Gore assured his audience that he would impose fiscal discipline.</p>
        <p>''I have been very clear, since the day I began this campaign, about what I am proposing,'' Mr. Gore said. ''An economic policy that's tried and tested and built on our values. Fiscal discipline as the foundation.''</p>
        <p>In a sarcastic appraisal of the budget situation in Texas, Mr. Gore said the state faced a budget shortfall of $610 million, one that Democrats linked to Mr. Bush's $1.7 billion tax cut, but one that Republicans said would be more than covered by new surplus tax revenues, as long as the economic boom continued.</p>
        <p>''You might think that a governor whose state ranks dead last in the entire nation for families with health coverage, who then gets a surplus courtesy of the national economic boom, might turn his attention to moving from No. 50 to, say, 45, or maybe even better -- but nooo,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>''Instead of taking up legislation to help families that desperately need health care, many of them going across the border to Mexico to try to find health care,'' he said. ''Instead of proposing legislation to help them, Governor Bush made a big tax break for the oil industry the very first bill that he signed that year. Now I don't really know how many oil executives in Texas lack health insurance, but I can tell you this -- a lot of children in Texas do.''</p>
        <p>He recited some statistics: Texas is 50th for women without health insurance, 49th for children without health insurance, and more than half of the children who are not covered are Latino.</p>
        <p>He went on: ''This week, as Governor Bush was traveling from photo op to photo op, trying to put the compassion into his conservatism, we learned that he failed to use tens of millions of dollars budgeted to feed poor and hungry children during the summer months.''</p>
        <p>The vice president then said, ''When he was asked why Texas was suddenly facing a shortfall, Governor Bush told The Dallas Morning News, 'I hope I'm not here to have to deal with it.' ''</p>
        <p>After the gasps died down, Mr. Gore added: ''With all due respect to Governor Bush, America can't afford to deal with it either.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said Mr. Gore was trying to have it both ways: first by criticizing Mr. Bush some months ago for not having to submit an actual budget the way other governors do, and now blaming this nonexistent budget for the shortfall. Mr. Bartlett also said that Mr. Bush had initiated an aggressive program to serve children, increasing the number being served to 260,000, from 175,000.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign also deployed Representative John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee and has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for Mr. Bush, on the governor's behalf. He said in a telephone interview that Mr. Gore's speech was ''absurd,'' in part because the Clinton-Gore administration had submitted 13 supplemental budgets over the last seven years, spending plans that were submitted when the nation was ''several hundred million dollars in the hole.''</p>
