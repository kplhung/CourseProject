        <p>Brian Daubach spent seven full years in the Mets' organization, and he played fewer than 20 games above Class AA. He played for the Mets' replacement team during the players' strike in 1995, and he had just over a year in the majors entering this season.</p>
        <p>''He was a good hitter at Double-A,'' said Jim Duquette, the Mets' assistant general manager, ''but he could not handle major league-type pitching.''</p>
        <p>Daubach left the Mets as a minor league free agent, became more selective, and learned to hit breaking balls better. When he became a free agent again before last season, the Mets tried to sign him.</p>
        <p>Daubach instead chose the Boston Red Sox, and while he has not forgotten that the Mets never gave him a chance, some Mets have not forgotten his stint as a replacement player. Mets catcher Todd Pratt felt insulted on Friday when he said Daubach told him to ''save it'' during an argument. Pratt referred to Daubach as a scab.</p>
        <p>Daubach, the Boston first baseman who beat the Mets with a two-run double in the ninth inning of Thursday's game, did not start today's game. He was inserted in the lineup only after Carl Everett, another former Met, went out of control after being ejected in the second inning for standing too close to home plate.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox may lose Everett for a while -- he bumped the home-plate umpire, Ronald Kulpa, twice during the confrontation -- but they did not miss him today. Daubach ripped a three-run homer off the Mets' ace, Mike Hampton, to break a tie and help the Red Sox to a 6-4 victory that concluded a tense three-game series.</p>
        <p>''It was like playoff baseball the last three days,'' said Daubach, who declined to discuss Pratt's comments or the satisfaction of beating the Mets. ''Two good teams played really good ballgames. Playing them in October, it would be a heck of a dogfight.''</p>
        <p>In the sixth inning, with the score tied, 2-2, a runner on second and one out, Hampton intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra, baseball's leading hitter (.395), to get to Daubach. Daubach said he understood the strategy -- ''When you've got a tough lefty out there with two lefties coming up, why are you going to pitch to Nomar?'' he said -- but Hampton disagreed with it.</p>
        <p>''I never want to intentionally walk somebody,'' Hampton said. ''I feel like I can do it on my own if I make good enough pitches to get him to swing at one of mine. But that's not my call.''</p>
        <p>On the first pitch to Daubach, Hampton hung a slider and Daubach lifted it into the netting above the tall left-field wall, his 15th homer and just the second allowed by Hampton in his last seven starts. Hampton (9-6) worked seven innings, allowing six runs.</p>
        <p>''I gave up eight hits,'' he said, ''and six of them looked like they were hit with a Wiffle Ball bat.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sox (45-42) beat the Mets twice in an eventful three-game series that featured three homers by Mike Piazza, including a bases-empty shot in the ninth inning today; a near brawl and the ejection of Dennis Cook on Friday; and the ejection of Everett today.</p>
        <p>The Mets (49-40) have played 11 of their last 14 games against Atlanta, the Yankees and Boston, and they have gone 4-7 in those games. They traveled to Toronto tonight to continue a road trip that will also take them to Montreal and Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously uphill for us, but that's not an excuse,'' Piazza said. ''If we're going to take charge of this or at least get in the playoffs, this is a big litmus test.''</p>
        <p>While the Mets played, their regular third baseman, Robin Ventura, was in New York having a magnetic resonance imaging test on his ailing right shoulder. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said he was worried Ventura had a torn labrum, which would have ended his season, but the diagnosis was a bruised rotator cuff. Ventura will meet with the team on Sunday but may require a stay on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>''At the worst, it's going to be a two-week injury,'' Duquette said. ''So we would try to fill from within.''</p>
        <p>Mike Kinkade, who is batting .367 at Class AA Binghamton as he learns to play catcher, has played third base in the majors and would probably be the Mets' best option from their farm system.</p>
        <p>Until Ventura returns, Valentine said Matt Franco could get significant playing time. Franco had a throwing error that brought in a run in the fifth inning, which tied the score, 2-2.</p>
        <p>Valentine said Todd Zeile would not move back to third, where he played for the last several years. Zeile, who doubled in the first inning to score the Mets' first two runs, has been contributing consistently at first base after some initial adjustments to his new position.</p>
        <p>Since May 26, Zeile has committed only one error, on the interference call involving Chuck Knoblauch of the Yankees last week. Zeile made another standout defensive play today, shoveling the ball from his glove to a running Hampton to retire Darren Lewis in the third inning.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON, who flew home to Texas for the All-Star Game break on ROGER CLEMENS's chartered flight, said he was unaware that General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS had barred the Mets' All-Stars from flying on the Yankees' chartered flight to the All-Star Game after their series last weekend. The Mets were irate at Clemens's beaning of MIKE PIAZZA. ''He's a friend of mine; he's still a friend of mine,'' Hamilton said of Clemens. ''Nothing has changed. We talked on the way home. He told me his side and what he was thinking, and that was fine with me.'' After returning, Hamilton told Piazza he had flown with Clemens, and Piazza said he was indifferent to it. ''If the roles were reversed, I don't see myself hitching a ride with someone on the other team,'' Piazza said. ''But I'm not being critical of Darryl. It's his decision. I'm not going to start a beef with him. I don't have a beef with him one bit.''</p>
