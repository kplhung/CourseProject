        <p>Talking about money has always been considered crass in Britain. So three floors full of 500 people not only talking about money, but asking for it, pleading for it and in at least one case begging for it, might normally be considered downright gauche.</p>

        <p>Talking about money has always been considered crass in Britain. So three floors full of 500 people not only talking about money, but asking for it, pleading for it and in at least one case begging for it, might normally be considered downright gauche.</p>
        <p>But not tonight. ''If you put all these people in a pub, they would never talk to each other,'' said Mike Boston, head of executive search at Citadel, a British recruitment company, who came armed with a box of business cards. ''This event breaks down that British reserve.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boston asserted that Britain was going through a fundamental shift in culture, driven by the new economy. In London, American business values and a combination of cultures from around the world have steadily infiltrated the traditionally staid British mind-set.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Stratford, a 24-year-old entrepreneur, is prowling for start-up financing. He needs about $750,000 for what he will describe only as a transport business. ''You could easily bum the idea,'' he said. His name tag, which identified him as being from a company called Equido.com, bore an Internet address he had not even bought yet. He does not have a business plan, either.</p>
        <p>While green dots clearly outnumbered the red dots, the money still seems to be pouring in here. Andrea Marshall, an American working in London as a consultant for Roland Berger &amp; Partners, said she used to believe that Britain's new economy lagged behind that of the United States by two years. But she recently revised her opinion. ''The stereotype that the Europeans are less entrepreneurial is no longer true,'' she said.</p>
        <p>One factor that continues to annoy people in the high-technology industry is Britain's tax treatment of employee stock options. In contrast to practice in the United States, employees must pay capital gains tax on stock options in Britain, making the incentive less attractive than a substantial salary. That puts pressure on companies to find loopholes and other ways to compensate employees.</p>
        <p>''It's so bloody complicated that you spend hundreds of thousands of pounds and lots of management time trying to find work-arounds,'' said Azzeem Azhar, chief executive of Esouk, an incubator company.</p>
