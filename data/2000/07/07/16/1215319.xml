        <p>When extra state police patrols first began appearing in Montauk in May, boarding boats, stopping trucks and inspecting restaurants, residents called it harassment, retaliation for an earlier incident when the tires of several police cars were slashed during a bar fight.</p>
        <p>The officers said at the time they were merely looking for fishing violations and underage drinkers, but state police officials now concede the officers' conduct was excessive.</p>
        <p>After an investigation, ''we made a determination that our presence in the weeks following the tire-slashing was not consistent with our responsibilities,'' said Col. Joseph Loszynski, an assistant deputy superintendent for the state police.</p>
        <p>He declined to say whether any officers would be disciplined, and noted that the East Hampton police have not made any arrests in connection with the tire-slashings that started it all.</p>
