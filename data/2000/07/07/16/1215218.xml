        <p>NOT too long ago, hundreds of men would regularly troop down into the deep, inky reaches of Philips Mine here to collect iron ore, copper and even uranium. Today, it's all about bats.</p>
        <p>The 200-year-old mine sits on a patch of land near the Appalachian Trail, and its 800-foot peaks afford incomparable views of the Hudson Highlands. No wonder, then, that as soon as the opportunity arose, the Open Space Institute, a nonprofit land conservation group bought the 37-acre parcel in 1999 with the notion of saving it from development and, ultimately, turning it over to hikers.</p>
        <p>But first, there was the matter of the gaping mine shafts. They were dark. They were mysterious. And they had been inviting to generations of children and unwise fun seekers. Neighbors remember youngsters paddling across an underground pond deep in the mine; some say two children crawled in once, and one never came out.</p>
        <p>For safety's sake, the Open Space Institute had to find a way to close the mine openings, known as adits. The trick was to seal the caves without harming the bats, snakes and other creatures.</p>
        <p>Enter Roy Powers, an engineering professor from Big Stone Gap, Va., whose summertime career is building grates that close caves to humans while permitting small animals to come and go at will. He is the director of the American Cave Conservation Association, and last month he was at work on the mine shafts in Philipstown.</p>
        <p>''I like bats,'' Mr. Powers said simply of his work. He is a taciturn man, gruff and matter-of-fact about the naturalist aspects of his undertaking. ''I like everything related to caves and karst -- crayfish and salamanders and all kinds of things,'' he said. ''The more mines we can save, the more habitat we can have.''</p>
        <p>It took 12 days of hot, sweaty work with Mr. Powers, his crew of welders and steel cutters and a handful of local volunteers  who learned about the Philipstown project on the Internet. They carried steel 750 feet up the mountain side, cut it on site and welded it together to make two small grates and one massive fence encircling the main shaft, a mouth gaping 20 feet across. The bars are spaced precisely 5 3/4 inches apart because even a fraction of an inch can make a difference to bats who dislike anything smaller -- or larger -- than that.</p>
        <p>The mine, which dates back to 1760, breathes out, quite literally, history that is hundreds of years old. At one opening, a cool stream of 55-degree air rushes out 24 hours a day; the crew called it their ''air-conditioner.''</p>
        <p>Betsy Thomason, a volunteer from New Jersey, was elated after a few days' work there. ''How often do we have an opportunity to use every muscle and this one too?'' she said, pointing at her brain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers, who is 61, said his summertime business started by accident 20 years ago when he tried to help a friend who couldn't keep teenage vandals from throwing beer parties in a cave on her property. Environmentalists got wind of his efforts to seal the opening while allowing wildlife to thrive, and they began watching closely.</p>
        <p>''Once it worked, more biologists stopped doubting and started believing, and now we've got them everywhere,'' Mr. Powers said.</p>
        <p>There is surprising demand for his services. In the last 20 years, he and a small crew have built 1,000 grates and fences for caves and mines all over the country, at about $10,000 a project. In 1982 he published a scientific paper on his technique.</p>
        <p>''This is a work of art for these folks,''  said Joe Martens, president of the Open Space Institute, who in a former life served as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's deputy secretary for energy and environment. ''They take great pride in it. They would bristle at anyone calling it ugly.''</p>
        <p>Rosa Moore is Mr. Powers's chief metal cutter. During the winter, she designs Web pages and sighs a lot. During the summer, she comes alive. ''This is it!'' she exclaimed, beaming. ''I travel everywhere with him doing these caves. We build 'em bat friendly, specially for the bats.''</p>
        <p>The Philipstown structure is by far the largest Mr. Powers has designed. The fence is 8 feet high, 255 feet around and reinforced at the ground so that determined trespassers will not be able to burrow beneath it.</p>
        <p>Such precautions are unfortunately necessary. The first part of the main shaft plunges 160 feet down, and if that doesn't sound like much, Mr. Powers puts it in perspective: ''I don't guess it matters much after 50 feet if something goes wrong,'' he said. ''Fourteen hundred feet or 160, it's going to be pretty much the same end.''</p>
        <p>Turn-of-the-century people were awestruck by the mine. In 1906, Williams T. Howell, a hiker, explored the site with a friend and wrote:</p>
        <p>''We tossed a stone in. The effect was weird, almost awesome. We heard it strike once; a moment's silence, and it struck again; then followed a splash in a pool of water; once more a brief silence, and then a ker-chug in deep water, and a boom and a multitude of echoes came rushing up the hole to scare the wits out of one.''</p>
        <p>Today, most drivers whipping up and down Route 9 never realize what they are cruising by. Even John H. Adams, chairman of the Open Space Institute and a 25-year resident of Philipstown, didn't know it was there before his group bought the plot using a $310,000 grant from the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund. The institute, based in Manhattan, has bought some 75,000 acres between New York City and the Adirondacks, most of it over the last 10 years, to  keep it all open, wild and protected. The Philipstown site is especially desirable, Mr. Martens said, because it can connect to the Appalachian Trail and could receive thousands of visitors each season.</p>
        <p>One of them will surely be Walter Daniels, 62. He has been tracking the Appalachian Trail on weekends since 1990. In June, just before setting off on another stretch of trail,  he was volunteering at the mine site to make it safe for fellow hikers. After a day's  work, he took a swig from his water bottle, tipped back his fisherman's cap and ambled back down the mountain toward civilization.</p>
