        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Eagle Rock Lookout is the highest point above the Oranges and Montclair, with a spectacular view of New York City and the harbor.</p>
        <p>On a recent stopover I noticed a solitary woman standing at the edge, holding a bright balloon with the words, ''I Love You.''</p>
        <p>She let it go, and as it floated up into the blue she started to cry. It drifted off, and she slowly walked to her car and drove away.</p>
        <p>PETER H. SECKEL</p>
        <p>We recently went to Newark International Airport so we could fly out West to visit our children. After a plane cancellation and a six-hour wait, we were finally on our way.</p>
        <p>My husband, who loves Chinese food -- and in another life was probably Asian -- naturally pre-ordered an Asian meal. Sure enough he was served his boxed lunch, which was labeled ''Asian Delite.''</p>
        <p>Salivating, he opened it to find a ham-and-cheese sandwich with orange juice. I wondered if there was an Asian on the plane who ordered an ''American Meal'' and received teriyaki and green tea.</p>

        <p>THE GARDEN (OF EDEN) STATE</p>
        <p>Lazing on the Jersey Shore</p>
        <p>With a Jersey tomato --</p>
        <p>Who could ask for anything more</p>
        <p>Than being a conch potato?</p>
        <p>EDMUND CONTI</p>
        <p>I was right behind the woman and the little girl as they entered Willowbrook Mall.</p>
        <p>''It's over,'' the child cried.</p>
        <p>''What's over?'' the woman asked.</p>
        <p>''The sidewalk sale,'' the child answered.</p>
        <p>The woman then explained: ''No, honey. It just started today.''</p>
        <p>''Then why are all the sidewalks gone?'' the child asked.</p>
        <p>She had a point.</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>Those of us who ride New Jersey Transit's Midtown Direct know that platforms are announced about five minutes before departure because of a shortage of tracks. Like so many others, I mill around in the concourse and then run to the track as soon as it is posted to avoid having to stand up for my entire trip to Summit.</p>
        <p>Yet every day, by the time I get to the train, the seats are almost all taken.</p>
        <p>Finally, I drew up the courage to ask the conductor what other passengers knew that I did not.</p>
        <p>''It's simple,'' he said. ''They all know I work the same train every day, so they wait until they see me come out of the conductors' waiting room and then follow me to the track.''</p>

        <p>(Hint: The 5:18 leaves on Track 4 about 90 per cent of the time.)</p>
        <p>SHORE FEVER  (With apologies to John Masefield)</p>
        <p>I must go down to the shore again</p>
        <p>where the land meets the sea and sky</p>
        <p>And all I need is a beach badge</p>
        <p>and a parking space nearby</p>
        <p>And some sunscreen and a blanket</p>
        <p>to spread in a clearing</p>
        <p>And some dark shades so the sun bathers</p>
        <p>won't catch me leering.</p>
        <p>I must go down to the shore again</p>
        <p>for the ocean is in my blood</p>
        <p>Where all I need is a beach chair</p>
        <p>and a cooler of Coors or Bud</p>
        <p>And a beach umbrella</p>
        <p>and a boom box blaring</p>
        <p>And a laptop and a cell phone</p>
        <p>to check how the Nasdaq's faring.</p>
