        <p>A city community board rarely turns down a costly amenity for its district. But that is what Community Board 8 did recently when it rejected a new $350,000 bathroom at Utopia Playground on 73rd Avenue in Fresh Meadows.</p>
        <p>The board asked the City Council to finance the bathroom last year. But last month, after the Council had set aside the money, the board voted against the project. The decision came at a board meeting at which more than a dozen neighborhood residents raised fears that the bathroom would attract drug users and vandals to the playground, as had a previous bathroom in the 1970's; the Parks Department tore it down in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>City Councilman Morton Povman, who helped secure the original financing, said he was ''shocked and embarrassed'' by the decision.</p>
        <p>''It's a very attractive park that attracts kids not only from the neighborhood but from other areas as well,'' he said. ''These kids are going to have to go to the bathroom either at a nearby house, behind a tree or  worse, out in the open.''</p>
        <p>Marc Haken, a board member, said he voted for the bathroom because it would have brought a Parks Department staff person, called a playground associate, to the site five days a week.</p>
        <p>Playground associates are assigned only to parks with bathrooms, which also have storage space. ''In the morning they clean up,'' he said, ''and in the afternoon they organize activities for kids, like arts and crafts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Povman said that he had considered overriding the board's vote but that he had instead asked the Parks Department to use the money  to build a bathroom at Queens Valley Playground in Kew Gardens Hills.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to argue with my constituents,'' he said. ''I'm going to see that the money is spent elsewhere in my district.''</p>
