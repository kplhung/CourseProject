        <p>Who says the city is no place to raise a child? Sure, it's easier to squeeze a stroller into an S.U.V. than into a yellow cab. But the city also has its advantages.</p>
        <p>''It's a vibrant and interesting place to raise a child,'' said Susan Maloney, a former fashion editor at Esquire who lives in TriBeCa. ''There are greater cultural opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Still, urban parents face special challenges, like how to travel safely on the subway, or where it is acceptable to breast-feed in public.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maloney asked herself those questions three years ago when her daughter was born. She searched for answers on the Internet, but could not find any Web sites focused on local matters, she said.</p>
        <p>With the help of her husband, who worked in the dot-com industry, Ms. Maloney gave birth in August 1999 to NewYorkBaby.com, a site that helps new parents navigate the big city.</p>
        <p>The site offers advice on matters like finding doctors and ''baby-proofing'' the home. A staff that includes a pediatrician, nutritionist and gynecologist writes much of the content. But the site also gives parents a place to exchange ideas about stroller-friendly subway stations and similar topics.</p>
        <p>The formula has proven prodigious. Earlier this year, Ms. Maloney and her husband, who had joined the start-up, introduced sister sites in half a dozen other cities under a new name, ''Urbanbaby.com.''</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- Seven ''baby icons'' are located along Urbanbaby's bottom, linked to the site's main sections: expecting, gear, play, health, care, community and, of course, shopping. ''Expecting,'' for instance, offers soon-to-be parents with information on obstetricians, maternity clothes and common baby names in the city. (According to the site, unisex names like ''Blair'' and ''Jamie'' are increasingly in vogue.)</p>
        <p>On the main page, ''what's new'' highlights recent features like a summer guide to swimming, and ''Event Picks'' suggests daily happenings around town.</p>
        <p>Popular features are listed along the left side of the home page: ''Kids Eat Out,'' a guide to family-friendly restaurants; ''Garage Sale,'' where to find used strollers and other items; and ''Message Boards,'' free-flowing chat about preschool waiting lists and other urban concerns.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- To sites including hospitals, diaper services, day care centers and au pair agencies. Also links to the Urbanbaby Store, an online mall that helps finance the site.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A newborn site that provides parents with information, support and services for raising a cosmopolitan baby.</p>
