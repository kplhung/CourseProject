        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After reading the article on Dr. David Bank, I felt compelled to sit down and write a letter concerning this excellent doctor. Dr. Bank has been my and my husband's dermatologist for a number of years now. We both suffer from rosacea and Dr. Bank has been instrumental in helping to control our condition. I have found him to be most caring, considerate and knowledgeable doctor anyone can ask for. My husband and I had a son born last year, and unfortunately the baby had a skin dryness that was of great concern to us. I called Dr. Bank from my hospital bed, and because he knew how distraught I was, he came to the hospital to check out the baby. I must mention he did this free of charge. I cannot equate the doctor described in the article with the same one I know and respect.</p>
