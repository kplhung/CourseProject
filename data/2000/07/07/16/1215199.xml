        <p>FOR more than seven years, residents of the Thompson Hill section of Thompson have held off a state order to install new sewers in their historic neighborhood.</p>
        <p>They have campaigned against the plan to bring sewer lines to 72 houses, a move that State Department of Environmental Protection officials said are necessary to curb water pollution problems that will only get worse. As far as hill residents are concerned, however, the town is being bullied by the state because of ''spotty sewage problems.'' They said that if their neighborhood, which is full of Revolutionary-era houses, is dug up for sewers, the work will destroy their colonial stone walls, the blasting will undermine the old foundations and kill the ancient trees that give the neighborhood so much of its charm. Their biggest fear is that if sewers replace their septic systems, it will pave the way for development.</p>
        <p>''It's a battle of right vs. might,'' said Mary Scripps, an organizer of the Thompson Hill Preservation Action Committee. The group has about 25 members from throughout Thompson, which is located in the far northeastern corner of the state with a population of 9,000. ''Sewers would be the kiss of death for this little Yankee town.''</p>
        <p>Although a new sewer system would mainly affect Hill residents, residents of the town, much of which already has sewers, twice voted down allocating town money to go toward the $4 million project, which would be partially funded by a federal grant. And First Selectman Brian Lynch, among others, said he believed the same will happen again in a third referendum on Thursday.</p>
        <p>If it does, the Department of Environmental Protection said it will ask State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal to take Thompson to court and force it to comply, said Jane Stahl, the deputy commissioner of the agency. The town has been given three extensions since 1993 to accept the sewer plan or come up with an acceptable alternative, she said. And time has run out.</p>
        <p>''We're in a third-strike situation,'' Mr. Lynch said. ''In many ways, having the project voted down again might be the best thing to happen. It would give us a chance to plead our case directly to the attorney general. It's a difficult situation. We need to find a way to settle it.''</p>
        <p>D.E.P. officials don't see it as such a complicated issue. According to data they have collected in two separate studies, overused and outdated septic systems have led to ground and surface water pollution in the neighborhood, said George Hicks, a senior sanitary engineer for the agency's Bureau of Water Management. The agency said it fears the pollution could get worse and eventually affect the whole town.</p>
        <p>Ammonia and chloroform bacteria -- substances that usually indicate domestic sewage problems -- have been found in storm drainage systems, Mr. Hicks said. Various colonies of bacteria that can be traced back to domestic waste have also been found in well water in the neighborhood and in ''micro-wells'' set up specifically for purity testing.</p>
        <p>''All of this means trouble,'' Mr. Hicks said. ''It's a public safety issue.''</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for this problem, Ms. Stahl said, is that much of the town is built on bedrock, and there is not enough soil to properly process the amount of sewage going into septic systems. Many people's septic systems are very old and are not designed to accommodate modern appliances like dishwashers and washing machines.</p>
        <p>''Homes built in the 1700's didn't have multiple bathrooms like so many homes do today,'' Ms. Stahl said. ''The bottom line is that sewage-wise, this area is stressed beyond its capabilities.''</p>
        <p>Thompson Hill residents admitted there have been some septic problems. But for the most part, Ms. Scripps said, problems have been spotty and minor.</p>
        <p>She and other preservation group members said they don't believe the results of the agency's water tests, and they want another environmental study performed by an independent or federal agency. They are also frustrated by what they call state officials' ''unwillingness'' to consider new, state-of-the-art sewer systems that use smaller pipes (thus, more shallow trenches) than the traditional eight-inch sewer pipes used in most municipalities, she added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stahl said the D.E.P. would consider a low-pressure sewer system, which features these smaller pipes, but stressed that it's one that requires both high maintenance and extra costs. Agency officials are also willing to talk about taking steps to help the village prevent unwanted development, she added, but argued that residents' idea that sewers equal new construction is unfounded and overly simplistic.</p>
        <p>''There are clear practices that can be put into place to limit sewer usage and future expansion,'' she said. ''New sewers do not mean unbridled growth and development. They mean fixing health problems, and potential problems, before things really start bubbling up.''</p>
        <p>Residents in favor of the sewer plan also say enough is enough.</p>
        <p>''The Thompson Hill section needs a sewer system, but people there have set their minds that they don't want it,'' said Joseph Laroche, 84, a former member of the local pollution control authority. ''Two licensed engineers, contracted by the state, have said that it needs to be done. Sewage is there in the ground. So let's face it. It needs to be done.''</p>
        <p>Thompson Hill residents, however, stand firm with their claims. ''We have an amazingly special town,'' said James Hillman, a psychologist and author. ''It will be devastated by blasting, and for no good reason.''</p>
