        <p>EYEING the buying and selling patterns of corporate insiders has for years been a good way for outside investors to gauge a company's prospects. After all, company insiders have access to much fresher and more detailed corporate intelligence than those who buy stocks with their noses pressed up against the glass.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, investors focus on insider activity in individual stocks. But the overall numbers can also be revealing. That is why the Leuthold Group, an investment research firm in Minneapolis, has studied large block trades made by insiders over the years. ''We're looking for the large transactions that indicate a large level of conviction about what an insider thinks their stock is going to do,'' said Eric Bjorgen, a senior analyst at the firm. ''If a lot of them are doing the same thing at the same time, it shows a broad trend.''</p>
        <p>To spot the trends, the firm compares the dollar amount of large block sales, net of block purchases, with the total value of the stock market. It defines a big block as a transaction of at least 100,000 shares or $1 million in value.</p>
        <p>Going back to 1983, researchers at Leuthold found that the percentage of market value made up of insider sales moves in a fairly tight range. When the amount of big block sales represents the smallest percentage of overall market value -- one-tenth of 1 percent -- it has often been a good buy signal for the overall market. Conversely, when block sales hit the top end of the range, seven-tenths of 1 percent of the market's total value, it has typically marked a good time to sell.</p>
        <p>In late 1993, for instance, block sales approached eight-tenths of 1 percent of market capitalization, a sell signal to the statisticians at Leuthold. The next year, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.54 percent.</p>
        <p>But a buy sign flashed in early 1995, when big block sales fell to one-tenth of 1 percent of market value. Later that year, the market began its historic four-year advance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bjorgen notes that the indicator's buy signals have been more reliable in recent years than its sell signals. That is largely because, even as insiders sold big last year, the overall market continued to soar.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the net block sale numbers have now gone certifiably off the charts. So far this year, insider block sales, net of buys, have totaled $36 billion, double what they were in the corresponding periods of 1998 and 1999. When weighed against total market value, insider block sales now account for a full 1 percent. That is unprecedented.</p>
        <p>One reason that these figures have gone sky-high recently may have to do with the fact that more insiders typically own greater numbers of shares today than they did in the past. These days, the amount of executive compensation tied up in shares of company stock -- options and restricted stock, for example -- is far greater than it was  even four years ago. With more stock being dispensed to insiders up and down the corporate ladder, it is perhaps not surprising that more shares come up for sale.</p>
        <p>So perhaps even the current outsized figures do not mean that a major downturn is imminent. But the hefty sales certainly help explain why, even as money has been flooding into equity mutual funds, the overall market has stalled this year. According to AMG Data Services, buyers have put $169 billion to work in equity funds. But as Mr. Bjorgen pointed out, 21 percent of that buying has been neutralized by insider selling.</p>
        <p>In any case, today's selling levels can hardly be construed as bullish. After all, it is indisputable that these blocks represent insiders making a big bet that their company's stock is not going higher in the coming months.</p>
        <p>''When you aggregate all the activity together over the last year, insiders have become increasingly concerned about their exposure to their companies,'' Mr. Bjorgen said. ''Insiders have sometimes been early, but they've usually been right.''</p>
