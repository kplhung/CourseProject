        <p>Standing beneath a glass case holding an elaborate black mask from the movie ''Zorro,'' Bruno Mazzilli is checking out the action in Planet Hollywood. But it is not the svelte young women circulating around the oblong bar that interest him -- unless they are wearing green dots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mazzilli works for Unin Fenosa, a Spanish utility that has bought big stakes in telecommunications operators and is now looking to do the same in Internet start-ups. It is the old economy seeking opportunities in the new.</p>
        <p>''We've already invested in two Internet companies and want to invest in more because it's definitely the future, but things aren't moving as fast here in the sector as they were six months ago,'' complained Mr. Mazzilli, 28, a corporate development executive. Behind the slowdown is nervousness from the sharp downturn in American technology stocks during the spring.</p>
        <p>But the Internet sector in Spain still lags behind other countries, he added. According to industry analysts, just one of every 10 Spaniards use the Internet regularly, much lower than the percentages in the United States or some other European countries.</p>
        <p>Others who gathered here expressed similar concerns: timidity among potential investors and Spain's need to catch up with the remainder of the wired world.</p>
        <p>''Now there's less euphoria,'' said Jaime Ventura, 24, managing director of Universidadweb.com, a Web site aimed at Spanish university students. ''But there is still incredible potential for growth in Spain, because the Internet is so underdeveloped in this country.''</p>
        <p>People here, ranging from older executives in business suits to those barely out of their teens and in sandals and T-shirts, said Spaniards would gladly surf the Web for information, but were reluctant to use it to buy goods, mainly because they are not comfortable sending their credit card numbers over the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is afraid of fraud,'' explained Cesar Canas, 28, who is trying to drum up business for Construdia, a company that he and two partners started last year to provide business-to-business services for small to midsize construction companies.</p>
        <p>But there is some confidence that people will get used to the Internet. ''The government is taking an active role in the sector and telling everyone that the new technology and the Internet are the future,'' Mr. Canas said. ''I hope it comes soon, because our company is operating now for seven months and we're still looking for customers.''</p>
