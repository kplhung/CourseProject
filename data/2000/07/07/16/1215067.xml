        <p>THE moment of truth came at an outdoor table in the Plaza Nueva in Granada, although neither of us admitted it. Instead, my husband, Bob, and I continued to sip our glasses of vino tinto and roll green olives between tongue and teeth, ejecting the pits with newly acquired expertise.</p>
        <p>The evening sun was refracted through dusty air, gilding the Gypsies and multinational youth in the plaza. Homeward-bound Granadans threaded through the crowds carrying grocery bags topped by market-fresh fruit. Tourists whose fanny packs made them look bustle-bottomed clustered around displays of postcards, fluttering lace fans and trays of castanets. As the shadows lengthened, the day's deafening traffic dwindled to the whine of motor scooters loaded beyond their capacities with three, even four clinging passengers. We sipped and watched and rested our feet, wondering how we would stay awake until Spanish dinner time at 8:30 p.m. -- 8 p.m. in restaurants that cater to tourists.</p>
        <p>And we wondered, although still not giving voice to the thought, what to do with the rest of our trip. Not that we didn't have plans. The plans for this first trip to the land of sun and saffron and tapas had been made in meticulous detail weeks before our departure.</p>
        <p>I had spent a fine meal's worth of money on Frommer's, Fodor's, Eyewitness and Let's Go guides and other aides, including  Learn-Spanish-in-Your-Car CD's. We had combed newspaper travel sections and reread articles clipped from food magazines. I had followed Internet links from one Spanish travel site to another until I was bleary-eyed and lost. We had begged friends and relatives of friends for memories of their own trips. Finally, knowing too much and not enough, we developed a two-week itinerary. Not all of Spain, of course. Just what called to us as we shoveled our way out of yet another Maine winter.</p>
        <p>Barcelona because 30 years ago Bob had read Orwell's ''Homage to Catalonia''; Quatretondeta in the mountains above Alicante for the small-town experience; Agua Amarga to dip our feet in the Mediterranean in a still-pretty seaside town; Granada for the Alhambra; Ronda because it is the most accessible of the Moorish pueblos blancos; Cordoba for its mosque and old city; Cuenca for its perilously hanging houses and its location in Castilla-La Mancha, and Barcelona again to rest before the flight home.</p>
        <p>I typed it all up -- flight numbers, hotel names, telephone numbers, dates of arrival, dates of departure. One copy faxed to our nearest and dearest, another hand-delivered to friends who would water our houseplants; a copy in Bob's carry-on; the copy in my carry-on stapled to a sheaf of hotel confirmation letters and directions.</p>
        <p>Too much? Well, I like lists. Besides, we were heading on the cusp of high season to a country whose language we do not speak.  We think of ourselves as flexible and adventurous. Yet we have reached the stage at which we no longer wish to trail our suitcases along foreign streets looking for a hotel with a vacancy. And to be honest, Bob does not want to traipse along a dark corridor to reach the bathroom and I need a mattress that does not sink to the floor.</p>
        <p>Munching on an olive as the sun set on the Plaza Nueva, I reflected that thus far the plans had been executed practically perfectly. Barcelona's light and space and elegance had made us giddy with pleasure. Arm in arm, we joined the perambulating throngs to walk up and down, and again up and down the Rambla, the grand tree-lined boulevard to the sea. Standing before Antoni Gaudi's famous wave-shaped building, whose wrought-iron balconies writhe like wind-tossed seaweed, Bob said, ''I could live here.'' Not Casa Mila specifically, but Barcelona. I agreed.</p>
        <p>Once out of Barcelona our rented silver Opel whizzed easily along the roads, nudged only slightly by the turbulence of passing BMW's.</p>
        <p>Climbing into the mountains, we entered the Spain of my imagination, all olive trees, grapevines and rock. Quatretondeta's terraced almond, olive and cherry groves seduced us as much as Barcelona had. We felt embraced by the welcome at Hotel Els Frares and by its blissfully comfortable beds. Walking among the olive trees, we inhaled air scented by waist-high rosemary growing wild on the hillsides. We greeted black-clad grandmothers as they stood by their scrubbed doorsteps on pristine village streets too narrow for car traffic. ''Buenos dias,'' we said, exaggerating the Castilian pronunciation in our enthusiasm. No wonder they smiled in response.</p>
        <p>On toward the south to Agua Amarga, a fishing village on the southern coast. It was as pretty as advertised -- a tumble of low, white buildings leading down to a quiet beach and the bluest blue Mediterranean.  The trip down the mountain took longer than planned; plotting the mileage in Maine, I had forgotten to take the slow-going curves of mountain roads into account. We were at the edge of our patience by the time we pulled up to the front door of our hotel, the MiKasa. But a cosseted night there (it felt more like a private villa than a 20-room hotel) restored us.</p>
        <p>Yet now, as the first of our three scheduled days in Granada sighed to a close, we began to feel burdened by our planning. The structure of those lists constricted rather than comforted. We were tired, of course, suffering from a midtrip weariness that is signaled by a longing for one's own washer and dryer. It's the time when I want nothing more than a cup of tea made by steeping real Darjeeling leaves in water that has reached a full rolling boil.</p>
        <p>WALKING slowly toward a barely 8 p.m. dinner, Bob said, ''I wish we could have more time in Barcelona,'' just as I said, ''I cannot remember why we are going to Cordoba.'' We stopped and stared at each other.</p>
        <p>Over lamb chops and garlic grilled chicken at the Restaurante Gallio on the Plaza Bib-Rambla, we dithered. ''We'd have to cancel all those reservations.'' ''Immediately, right away, now,'' I agreed, checking my watch as if it were already too late.</p>
        <p>''The Barcelona hotels are bound to be full.'' ''Where would we stop along the way?'' ''We can't make it back in one day.'' ''The rental car people might penalize us for returning the car early.''</p>
        <p>This last brought us up short. Unable to change our plans because Avis might punish us?</p>
        <p>A shiver of excitement made us grin. We would be on the lam, playing hooky, leaving at intermission, absent without leave. We toasted each other with what was left in the bottle.</p>
        <p>In the end, it was almost easy. Phrasebook in hand, we called in our cancellations.  We were sorry, sorry, sorry, but, ''si, por favor, quiero cancelar. Muchas gracias.''  That done, we fretted when our Barcelona hotel proved full for the new nights we wanted. I flapped the sheaf of canceled hotels at Bob. ''We've done it now.'' I didn't quite wail, but I was fierce, as if my sudden loss of mooring were his fault rather than our shared adventure. Ultimately, we handed the search over to Barcelona's hotel reservation bureau, which found what we wanted within an hour. Amazing.</p>
        <p>The next day, we toured the Alhambra with rediscovered enthusiasm. The day after that we tried two new tapas bars and succeeded in staying awake for an 8:30 dinner. On the fourth day, silly with excitement, we pointed our silver Opel north toward four unencumbered, ribbon-tied days in Barcelona. And the unplanned night on the road? We consulted the map. What about visiting Elche, which claims to have the largest palm grove in Europe? In the land of Quixote we had learned to follow our hearts, not a schedule.</p>
