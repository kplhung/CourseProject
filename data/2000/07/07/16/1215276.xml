        <p>This restaurant, formerly known as Bowery Bar, draws a young, great-looking crowd and the occasional celebrity. Starters include tandoori-spiced lamb chops with cucumber yogurt raita and a cilantro vinaigrette; grilled calamari salad with chicory, red and yellow peppers in a lemon vinaigrette; and mozzarella and tomato salad with fresh basil, red wine vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil. Entrees include yellowfin tuna, seared rare with a salad of watercress, cucumber, endive, crispy potato and miso ginger vinaigrette; roasted-eggplant-filled ravioli with smoked mozzarella, roasted garlic, fresh basil in a light tomato cream; and oven-roasted red snapper with vegetable risotto, baby lettuces and a lightly curried roast tomato vinaigrette. (Article: 5/5/00)</p>
        <p>CARAVAN OF DREAMS +  (212) 254-1613; 405 East Sixth Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A; $$; smoking permitted; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The food at this vegetarian restaurant is full of flavor. Caravan uses ingredients that are locally grown and organic. Appetizers include grilled marinated tempeh, garnished with mustard, sprouts, baby greens and kale; peanut sesame noodles, garnished with arame, cucumber and sprouts on a bed of salad greens; and guacamole with corn chips or chapati (sprouted whole wheat tortilla), homemade salsa, olives, parsley and a touch of scallions, red pepper and celery. Entrees include the ginger-curry stir fry of kosher organic pasta, sauteed vegetables and greens, sesame oil, fresh ginger, cumin and herbs, with choice of grilled marinated tempeh, tofu or seitan garnished with toasted sesame seeds; vegetable burger platter including brown rice, topped with tahini sauce and parsley, served with salad, marinated kalamata olives, garnished with sprouts; and grilled marinated tofu, topped with tahini served with mixed blanched vegetables and greens, brown rice and sea vegetables. ($25 and Under: 2/3/95)</p>

        <p>This lively, informal, friendly Tuscan restaurant has Italian rustic decor, with exposed brick walls, low ceilings and lots of wood and terra cotta. Appetizers include Cavaillon melon and prosciutto di carpegna; thinly sliced tuna with green peppercorns; and ricotta and Swiss chard flan with raw tomato sauce. Entrees include wild striped bass with roasted tomatoes, capers and black olives and fennel; grilled pork chop with spinach and mashed potatoes; and oven-roasted quail with braised turnips and cucumber salad. Pasta dishes include ravioli stuffed with ricotta and herbs in a browned butter and sage sauce; thin spaghetti with white pesto; and quill-shaped pasta with creamy stracchino and fresh Tuscan sausage. (Review: 4/21/99)</p>
        <p>IL CANTINORI *  [Rating: One star]  (212) 673-6044; 32 East 10th Street; $$$; smoking section in bar area; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>One of the original Tuscan trattorias, Il Cantinori has a charming rustic room with terra cotta floor tiles, white walls and big, striking sprays of flowers. Antipasto selections include sauteed wild mushrooms with mozzarella and basil; calamari with seasoned tomatoes; and wild Italian chicory grilled with smoked mozzarella. Main dishes include penne with minced eggplant, onions, tomato and olives; filet mignon with a garlic dip; boneless duck breast sliced with lentils; loin of lamb sliced, seasoned with herbs, served with potatoes; swordfish with herbs, charcoal grilled; and shrimp breaded, grilled and served over beans.

        <p>PISCES RESTAURANT +++  (212) 260-6660; 95 Avenue A, at Sixth Street; $$; smoking at the bar and outside; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Pisces has gone through several incarnations -- from Southwestern seafood to late-night raw bar -- but it is still offering great seafood dishes at bargain prices. Appetizers include crab meat spring roll, fresh tomatoes, avocado and soy sauce; cod and crab cakes with a fennel salad and a bouillabaisse vinaigrette; and smoked scallops, baked in phyllo with vegetables, with a lemon dill vinaigrette. Entrees include poppyseed-crusted salmon with bok choy and basmati rice, in a carrot-ginger sauce; linguine with littleneck clams, with sweet corn and fresh tomatoes in a garlic white wine sauce; seafood paella with green peas, diced pepper and saffron rice; and rigatoni with rock shrimp and calamari with tomatoes and olives.
