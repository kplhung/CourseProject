        <p>In the dimly lit Planet Hollywood in central Moscow, entrepreneurs are fishing for financing. Some carry business plans scrawled on single sheets of paper; others speak of offices in Siberia. A banker chatted under a fake palm tree with the head of Russia's biggest Internet portal, Port.ru.</p>
        <p>Russia's online market is tiny. In a population of 147 million, only about two million people use the Internet. Advertising last year barely topped $2 million, but that seemed to indicate all the more potential for a country dominated by scientists and engineers. ''This place is a gold mine of sophisticated ideas,'' said Igor Kocmanek, president of iXcelerator.com, whose assets include a software company.</p>
        <p>When First Tuesdays began here last October, a group of about 40 curious industry insiders took part. That number has swelled to more than 300, and investors sometimes outnumber project developers. ''It's pure business,'' said Mr. Kocmanek, a Czech citizen who formerly worked at an investment bank here. ''When we started in October, there was no money in the Russian Internet. Then in the winter, it all started.''</p>
        <p>Over all, there has been about $15 million in commerce involving what locals call RuNet -- the Russian Internet -- according to Ron Lewin, chairman of the Internet technology committee at the American Chamber of Commerce here.</p>
        <p>The biggest problem in Russia is finding good managers. The Soviet Union produced generations of talented scientists and engineers, people in the business community say, but it crushed entrepreneurial instincts. People with ideas lack marketing skills. Business plans are rough road maps, hastily drawn.</p>
        <p>''Good C.F.O.'s are few and far between,'' said Brian Wardrop, who helps manage an $80 million high-technology fund in central Europe. ''A lot of times, we'll pass on a deal because we don't believe the company will actually produce monthly reports. Responsiveness is a problem.''</p>
        <p>Yet niches abound in Russia's nascent market -- and the design of programs for export is one of them. Russian companies exported an estimated $1.5 million in programs last year, dwarfed by, say, India's $6.5 billion. Russians have a reputation as superb programmers, but the country's main business hurdle is  selling the goods.</p>
        <p>Some projects defy the imagination. As Igor Vasiliades, a first vice president at Sibintek, an Internet subsidiary of Yukos Oil, Russia's second-biggest oil company, tells it, his company is trying to exploit that niche. So Sibintek retrained 1,100 unemployed oil-town workers in four Russian cities and put them to work in computer programming labs. Eventually, Sibintek plans to have 2,000 retrained employees writing programs for foreign clients. ''We want big factories that can fill any order quickly and cheaply,'' Mr. Vasiliades said. ''Labor in the regions is a fifth of what it costs in Moscow.''</p>
        <p>Other projects bring the market to Internet users. Brian Flygare, sales director at a small marketing service provider, Direct Star, said his site had struck a note with small businesses that lack the time or the money to develop online sales. Mr. Flygare sends troops of college students out to retailers, like the shops in the famed GUM department store on Red Square, to persuade them to post coupons on the site offering discounts to customers. Direct Star gets a small fee.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of retailers out there who are terrified -- they hear 'Internet' and they don't understand it,'' Mr. Flygare said. ''This is a way to wet their feet.''</p>
