        <p>MY LOVE AFFAIR</p>
        <p>WITH AMERICA</p>
        <p>The Cautionary Tale</p>
        <p>of a Cheerful Conservative.</p>
        <p>By Norman Podhoretz.</p>
        <p>248 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>Those familiar with the tribulations of Norman Podhoretz may be somewhat surprised to hear him declare in ''My Love Affair With America,'' the latest book-length chapter of his long-running autobiography, that there is ''some kind of peace . . . at hand'' in the fierce cultural and political wars of the last four decades. Could it be that Podhoretz -- one of the famously embattled members of the New York intellectual world, a political pugilist who over the course of his life has perfected his roundhouse right -- is going soft? Could the author of the brash and not a little boastful paean to success, ''Making It,'' of the not-so-fond farewell to the left, ''Breaking Ranks,'' and, most recently, of the highly entertaining though hardly warm-and-fuzzy memoir ''Ex-Friends,'' have finally discovered that the storm clouds hovering above, do, in fact, contain a few silver linings?</p>
        <p>The book's subtitle, ''The Cautionary Tale of a Cheerful Conservative,'' like much of the contents, should allay any fears that Podhoretz, in retiring five years ago as the longtime editor of Commentary magazine, has completely deserted his post. Still, there is an unmistakable shift in tone, a mellowing of sorts, that was first apparent in ''Ex-Friends.'' That book, despite its name and its various jabs, was also playful and, at times, wistful in its affirmation of the bond that tethered the author to his former friends, and in its recognition of the emotional hold that only youthful friendships or enmities can have on us as we age.</p>
        <p>But if Podhoretz is a man in love, it is the love one finds in Ingmar Bergman films rather than in syrupy Hollywood romances. Amid the ardor, he recounts plenty of brawls with familiar enemies, political, cultural and otherwise. He fought with the literary critic Irving Howe over Howe's radical critique of American capitalism; he argued with European intellectuals over their disparagement of American culture; he battled with the New Left and its heirs over Vietnam and Israel; and more recently he has disagreed with the conservative movement's attack on America's supposed moral decline.</p>
        <p>''My Love Affair With America'' recounts once again the story of Podhoretz's journey from the immigrant margins of Brownsville, Brooklyn to the center of American intellectual life. Over thirty years ago, in ''Making It,'' Podhoretz presented this journey as a typically American story of ambition, hard work and luck, but his interest this time around is in understanding its uniquely Jewish resonances. It is a tale not just of success, but of almost biblical liberation.</p>
        <p>Podhoretz begins his book with a rich, unsentimental portrait of the harsh lives of his grandparents. Esther Malkah, his maternal grandmother, was at once a timid and fiercely protective woman. Unlike her biblical namesake, she is ''beaten-down and withdrawn,'' a ''stooped and wizened old woman with the face of a thousand wrinkles.''</p>
        <p>A barely literate East European immigrant, Malkah came from a village in Galicia, where she had been prey to war, near-starvation and the region's ever shifting -- but invariably anti-Semitic -- governments. So traumatized and pulled inward is she by this experience that despite finding a haven in America, she can never be fully of America. Upon hearing on the radio that ''Uncle Sam Needs You'' just as her son is being drafted into the Army during World War II, she shrieks in Yiddish: ''Who is he, that Uncle Sam? Him I would especially like to send six feet under!''</p>
        <p>Esther Malkah's experience and her worldview become a touchstone for Podhoretz's own journey toward fully realizing identity as an American. He gradually sheds the manners and language that mark him as an outsider. (In reply to a teacher's query in the school's stairwell about where he's going, he explains that he's ''goink op de stez.'') He is taken under the wing of a doting high school English teacher and profits from a remedial speech class that helps him win a scholarship to Columbia, despite the university's strong undercurrent of genteel anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>At its best, the book weaves, in fuguelike fashion, autobiography, history and polemic into a complex portrait of 20th-century intellectual life. Podhoretz provides a particularly sharp-edged overview of the longstanding ambivalence intellectuals have shown toward American culture since the late 19th century, from Henry Adams's aristocratically inspired vitriol against American vulgarity to Sinclair Lewis's scorn for middle-class values to the left-leaning New York intellectuals' attacks on middlebrow culture.</p>
        <p>Though Podhoretz's jousting with friends and ex-friends helps illuminate his own intellectual evolution, his polemics come at a cost; he cannot resist using his ''love affair'' as a cudgel against his ideological opponents. His own attacks on America in the early 1960's are attributed to his ''limitless faith in the perfectibility of this country,'' while the critiques by his ex-friends on the left are motivated by vengeance or bitterness or sheer navete. It's true that left-wing attacks on America sometimes grew shrill and puerile toward the end of the 60's, but Podhoretz fails to perceive the deep sadness and wounded hope implicit in the left's fury over America's racism and involvement in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Podhoretz remains, through much of the book, the ideological warrior in winter, fondly recounting his struggles. But in his final pages, he breaks free from ideological warfare and allows himself to rest and to sing. His chosen hymn is dayenu (roughly translated as ''that alone would have been enough for us''), the traditional refrain sung at the end of the Passover Seder recounting the blessings bestowed by God on the Jews liberated from Egypt. In this retelling it is America that has blessed Podhoretz, and it is an altogether fitting conclusion to his book. The Exodus story provides an allegory of oppression and redemption, while it illuminates his larger thesis about the Jews and America, one learned nearly half a century ago at the feet of his great predecessor at Commentary, Elliot E. Cohen.</p>
        <p>Commentary at midcentury was a great incubator of intellectual Jewish talent thanks to Cohen, who became an influential mentor to those young writers lucky enough to work under him. Most were the children of poor immigrants, self-conscious about their Jewishness and at least partially estranged from America by their own parochialism as well as by the Marxist ideology with which they had grown up. The Alabama-born Cohen was instrumental in teaching members of this generation to think of America as their country. Podhoretz recalls that for Cohen, the postwar preservation of Jewish culture was of importance not simply for the Jews' own sake, but because the failure to preserve that culture ''would rob the country of one of the pillars on which it rested.'' America, Podhoretz came to realize, was different from all the other countries in which the Jews had lived during their long diaspora because it had accepted the Jews as had no other country before it.</p>
        <p>Drawing on the work of the critic Edmund Wilson, among others, Podhoretz makes a convincing case for this particular form of American exceptionalism. He cites the Puritans' strong identification with the biblical Hebrews and points out that for early Americans, many of them religious outcasts themselves, the embrace of religious tolerance extended even to the country's non-Christian inhabitants. George Washington's remarkable letter to a Jewish congregation in Newport, R. I., in which he wrote ''May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants,'' is only one such example. In Podhoretz's America the Jews have indeed found the promised land they have long sought. Despite the anti-Semitism that has always existed alongside a tradition of acceptance, the fact is that Jews have become part of this country in a way that they had never been Russians or Poles. It is Podhoretz's accomplishment to reveal this process -- to show us how Esther Malkah's grandson became an American.</p>
