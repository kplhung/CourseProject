        <p>The owner of a popular Korean nightclub in Midtown Manhattan was shot and killed early yesterday by a customer who argued with him over a $980 bill, the police said.</p>
        <p>The customer shot the owner, Sang Dal Choi, 43, several times in the head inside the Dae Tong Ryung club in the basement of 6 East 32nd Street about 4:25 a.m., said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman. The suspect, whom the police described only as an Asian man in his 20's, pulled out a pistol as he argued with the owner over the check.</p>
        <p>The suspect was in the club, the name of which means ''president'' in Korean, with as many as four friends, Lieutenant Biegel said. Initial police documents mistakenly reported that the killing occurred in Club Nix, another Korean establishment, which is on the third floor of the same building.</p>
        <p>Investigators believe that the killer, who escaped, was a customer in the past, the police said. But it was unclear whether he had been identified by detectives from the Midtown South Precinct, who are investigating the killing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Choi, who lived in Flushing, Queens, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead, the police said.</p>
        <p>At the time of the shooting, the club was empty except for the employees and the gunman's party, the police said. After the shooting, the police said, everyone in the group fled.</p>
        <p>Workers on the block said the club was popular with Korean-Americans and Koreans, with patrons primarily in their early to mid-20's.</p>
        <p>A security guard at the Avalon hotel a few doors away said the club usually heated up about 2 a.m. ''Every night there's fights, people punching each other,'' said the guard, Eric Delgado. ''People are drunk and they don't think clearly.''</p>
        <p>Another man, Do Hyun Kim, 20, who works in Lee Wireless, a cellular telephone store near the club, said he visited the nightspot every few weeks. He said he was surprised to learn of the shooting, because security guards at the club frisked all the male patrons for weapons before they were admitted.</p>
        <p>''People go there and fight all the time,'' he said. ''Come here at 3 in the morning and you would see drunk people screaming and staggering all along 32nd Street from one end of the block to another.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim said the staff had a reputation for overcharging the late-night, hard-drinking patrons, whom he described as a well-to-do crowd who paid a $60 to $70 per person minimum. ''Sometimes, I think the waiters do rip people off, because the people are drunk and they don't care,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The club prohibits anyone in a large party from leaving until the bill is paid, he added.</p>
        <p>A 26-year-old woman who said she frequented the club and had met the owner was not surprised that violence there had gotten out of hand. ''I thought something like this would happen,'' she said. ''There are always these punks who try to start something; mostly it's because they're drunk.''</p>
        <p>Ernesto Sanchez, 46, who lives directly across from the club, said that it was common for bar patrons to stumble into the street screaming and fighting, and that he had called the police in the past. ''Sometimes they fight, but mostly they are just loud and drunk and annoying,'' he said. ''It's completely different from what it's like now'' in midafternoon. ''Now it's all nice and happy, but at night, it's different. More energy.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 18, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about the fatal shooting of a nightclub owner in Manhattan gave an erroneous identification from the Police Department in some copies for the place where it occurred. The club was Dae Tong Ryung, in the basement of 6 East 32nd Street. (Club Nix, on the third floor of the same building, was not involved.)</p>
