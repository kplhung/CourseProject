        <p>In ''A Madison Avenue Fantasy,'' (Seniority, July 2), Fred Brock discussed the advertising industry's continuing emphasis on young consumers, despite the greater wealth and increasing numbers of older adults. The column drew varied responses from readers.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am one of those young people who work in the e-commerce business. But I see that the needs and desires of older adults are not being addressed in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>Our society can gain insight and value from our ever-aging population. Many older adults are still so young in today's society, compared with the situation just 30 years ago. They have the resources and education to pursue their lifestyles with passion. New medicines and technologies have improved their overall health. As far as I can see, they are now able to enjoy themselves as never before.</p>
        <p>In a selfish sense, I want to help develop a stronger sense of community and value about seniors so that as I age, there will be a continued respect for what I still have to offer. People should understand that humans are like fine wine; they get better with age.</p>
