        <p>IN a new exhibition at the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art here, one large, metal, mushroom-shaped sculpture resembles an inviting piece of playground equipment. Made by the Norwegian artist Hans Hamid Rasmussen, its convex surface is studded with orange knobs, actually bolt-on hand- and footholds used to make practice climbing walls. Viewers who climb on the sculpture quickly find themselves pitching about as the mushroom's cap dips and wobbles violently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rasmussen's interactive sculpture, titled ''Equilibrium,'' may furnish the most direct metaphor of what he and five other international artists endured last fall as a prelude to this show, which runs through Sept. 10. Their monthlong trek in the Himalayas, sponsored by the museum, was plagued with lost baggage, serious illnesses, dangerously bad weather and an exhausting pace that quickly did in the less prepared among them.</p>
        <p>The project, titled ''Delicate Balance, Six Routes to the Himalayas,'' had been proposed by the Kiasma's chief curator, Maaretta Jaukkuri, and one of the artists, Jussi Heikkila of Jyvaskyla, Finland, as a group exercise in perceptual awareness and intercultural exchange, Ms. Jaukkuri said in an interview at the museum. Instead, the group seems to have taken six separate and very personal journeys. In fact, because of delays and hitches, there was actually no time when the whole group walked together.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Heikkila, who had made Himalayan treks before, and Mr. Rasmussen, of Oslo, the artists were Xu Bing, a native of China now based in New York; Honore d'O of Ghent, Belgium; Simryn Gill of Sydney, Australia, and Liisa Roberts of New York. The artists flew separately to Katmandu in October, planning to walk along high mountain trails to reach villages at the base of Mount Everest's neighboring peaks.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, back in Helsinki, Ms. Jaukkuri anxiously received reports of the expedition's trials. There were moments, she concedes, when things seemed dire. Mr. d'O had a heart condition that may have been exacerbated by the exertion and high altitudes. Despite high fevers and advice from Nepalese doctors not to continue, he managed to complete part of the trek but underwent heart surgery immediately afterward (he is now in good health). All the other men were ill at different times. Six-foot snowfalls above the trails caused delays, and after a particularly grueling few days midway through the trip, Ms. Roberts and Ms. Gill arranged to leave the trek a week early, a decision they later regretted.</p>
        <p>The exhibition catalog, an honest and revealing narrative from a group under unusual pressure, reads more like a harried travel diary than an art text. Ms. Jaukkuri notes that rather than being able to pursue an intellectual examination of perception and culture, the artists spent all their mental and physical resources simply coping with the situation and adjusting to the circumstances.</p>
        <p>''They had to concentrate more on themselves, on their own reactions, and their ability to deal with things, than on observing the surrounding nature and culture,'' she writes. She quotes Mr. Xu, who says the participants had to abandon their roles as artists and meet simply as human beings. Despite their own difficulties, the artists say, they were also disturbed by having a support staff of 27 porters and Sherpas who seemed to them underdressed and ill-equipped for the weather conditions. Extreme poverty in the villages, in contrast to crowds of expensively decked-out Western trekkers, also haunted them.</p>
        <p>In the show, aside from the bucking mushroom piece, little conveys these harrowing experiences -- except possibly Mr. d'O's obsessive installation of elevated hospital beds and medical accouterments, like surgical masks, Band-Aids and cotton balls, that allude to his heart surgery.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jaukkuri discovered that asking artists to make art out of thin air required her to relinquish curatorial control. ''I have been thinking that, in a way, it was like de-curating an exhibition,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heikkila's comparatively spare installation consists of a hiker's tent hand-lettered with the names of Nepalese birds and a telescope trained on a site beyond the gallery's windows. Through the telescope one reads a quotation inscribed on a distant building and attributed by the artist to a Nepalese Sherpa: ''Some come looking, looking; some come -- seeing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heikkila says his initial proposal to Ms. Jaukkuri had been for the trek to be an ecological activist project in which the artists would collect trash left along high-altitude trails by Western tourists, then make the refuse into conceptual art to be sent on tour back to Western nations. The revised version of the project, he writes in the catalog, was ''doubtless a lot more interesting than getting to mess about with the rubbish there.''</p>
        <p>Still, the unresolved environmental issue frustrates Mr. Heikkila, as does the grinding poverty the artists encountered. Mr. Xu's installation makes a gesture toward this with a re-creation of one of the red donation boxes that line popular trekking trails in Nepal. In exchange for a donation, which will be sent to Nepal, viewers may take a print of one of Mr. Xu's small landscape sketches.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roberts's and Ms. Gill's collaborative installation also reconnects with Nepal, while subtly subverting the whole enterprise. Tables hold stacks of two newspapers from Katmandu, one in English, one in Nepalese. During the show, these stacks will grow as the artists' actual work, a narrative comic strip, is printed in the papers. The strip presents the artists' take on the project, as well as Nepalese viewpoints on the impact of trekking by Western tourists. The artists wrote the text but found two editorial cartoonists from Katmandu to draw the strip. The six artists are all characters in the strip, allowing Ms. Roberts and Ms. Gill a chance, perhaps, to rescript the adventure.</p>
        <p>In the catalog, Ms. Roberts and Ms. Gill muse about how to process an experience that bordered on the profound. Ms. Roberts observes that, while trekking, they were emotionally and intellectually separated from the environment, even while being so physically engaged with it. ''That speaks to the impossibility of an absolute context or place,'' she writes, ''and to the ways in which places formulate themselves to different people.''</p>
