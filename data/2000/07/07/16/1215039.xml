        <p>In the Name of SaloMe</p>
        <p>By Julia Alvarez.</p>

        <p>''ASK not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' John F. Kennedy urged in his 1961 inaugural address. Dominican-born, Cuban-bred Camila Henriquez Urena didn't wait for an American politician to tell her where her patriotic duty lay. In 1960, after 20 years of prosperous exile in the United States, she resigned as head of the Spanish department at Vassar and returned to Cuba to join the revolution. There this 66-year-old woman with two Ph.D.'s threw herself into the literacy campaign, teaching in factories and barracks, in city and rural classrooms.</p>
        <p>What drove her? She was not blind or nave, and much in Castro's Cuba -- the cult of personality, the mushrooming bureaucracy, the ''overwrought'' revolutionary jargon -- dismayed her. But she stayed on long after other family members had fled. She left only in 1973, returning to the Dominican Republic to live out her final days.</p>
        <p>The search for answers in this ambitious historical novel about a remarkable Caribbean family sends Julia Alvarez back a hundred years to the 1860's and 70's, when Camila's mother, the poet Salome Urena, was in her teens and 20's. As it happens, the passionate young Salome was recognized in her own lifetime as a nationalist heroine, a sort of Jose Marti in skirts, whose decorously rhymed patriotic verse provided inspiration in her country's continuing struggles against Spain and Haiti and a grim series of home-grown military dictators. She died in her 40's, of tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>It's this long view, this hundred-year reach, that makes ''In the Name of Salome'' original and illuminating. From Camila's intimate perspective, Castro's Cuba gave scope to the ideals and enthusiasms of the 19th-century Caribbean heroes of liberation. Education was a passion with these people: Marti wrote and published a children's magazine, The Golden Age, and Salome Urena founded a demanding school for girls in an age when literacy was viewed as a threat to women's virtue. So Camila picked up where her mother left off. She was in Cuba to teach.</p>
        <p>If Camila viewed Castro with philosophical patience, it was perhaps because by 1960 she had seen a great deal. In 1916, American troops occupied the Dominican Republic and her father, Francisco Henriquez, recently chosen provisional president, was forced to flee. At least Castro's Cuba was not run by the Marines. Besides, Camila had been too close to politicans all her life to take them entirely seriously. Her father, having been ejected from the Dominican presidency, spent the rest of his life trying to get himself reinstated, driving his family crazy in the process. Often in this wryly feminist novel, politics seems to be an arena for sterile macho posturing, and women quietly do the important work. In one of the book's wittier moments, Camila sees Castro on television and remembers her late father's face -- the same pouty mouth, the same intent face, something fierce about the eyes.'' The resemblance scarcely counts in Fidel's favor.</p>
        <p>Alvarez herself is well equipped to celebrate Camila, the independent, upright, dignified and until now largely unknown daughter of a famous mother. Alvarez's own father was a political dissident forced to flee the Dominican Republic in 1960, near the end of Rafael Trujillo Molina's murderous regime. She was 10 at the time. Educated in the United States, she has published three previous novels, a book of essays and three volumes of poetry.</p>
        <p>This is Alvarez's most ambitious work to date. In fact, her subject -- the mingling of historical and personal destinies -- is so rich that she can't quite do it justice. Willa Cather could have, maybe, if she'd read the right sources. (Her take on Hispanic New Mexico in ''Death Comes to the Archbishop'' is hotly disputed in the Southwest today.) But, lacking such narrative genius, Alvarez often reduces the lives of Salome and her daughter to a series of creaky vignettes. People keep reading one another's mail or catching one another in compromising sexual positions, while offstage yet another government falls. In one carefully contrived scene, Camila even gets to deliver a slap to the face of the Marines -- in the person of a timid gringo suitor. This segment exemplifies the book's main weakness: we're always aware of the author's deft hand pulling the strings into preconceived patterns, as if a novel were a piece of macrame.</p>
        <p>And yet, despite its precious, contrived moments, the book delivers a strong sense of who these people were. It does full justice to the pathos of Salome's early death and Camila's troubled relationship with her older brother, Pedro, a noted literary historian. The brilliant and likable Pedro, his mother's favorite, had a tragic life as he wandered in exile from Cuba to Mexico to the United States and finally Argentina. But this cosmopolitan man was also a sexual conservative, the jealous guardian of his womenfolks' morals. He omitted his mother's love poems from his 1920 edition of her work. (They were first published only in the centenary edition of 1950.) In soap opera mode, Alvarez has Pedro react in shock when he discovers Camila in the arms of her lesbian lover, an American dance instructor. As fiction, the scene feels like just another setup, but the ambiguous brother-sister bond is still strangely moving. ''Often,'' Alvarez says of the sexually confused, never married Camila, ''she has wondered if destiny has not played a trick and given her a perfect companion as a brother instead of a lover.''</p>
        <p>What saves the book throughout -- but undercuts it too -- is our awareness that these fascinating people really lived. We're grateful for Alvarez's insights, but sometimes we mistrust her inventions. If only the entire novel were as fresh and authentic as this eyewitness account of the elderly Camila, which Alvarez heard in Cuba and retells in her publisher's newsletter:</p>
        <p>A former student of Camila's recalls: ''You know, that woman used to walk to the university every day. I don't know how many kilometers. Even when it was raining. . . . But she would never ask for a ride. We students would have to watch out for her. One time it was my turn to take her home. I had an old run-down '56 Chevy, and wouldn't you know it, the car caught fire on the way to her apartment. . . . People rushed out of their houses with buckets of water. After we put out the fire, I looked around for la profesora. There she was, sitting quietly in the passenger's seat with her arms folded.''</p>
