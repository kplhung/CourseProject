        <p>Deep in the Heart</p>
        <p>By Sharon Oard Warner.</p>
        <p>Dial, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights advocates and anti-abortion campaigners clash in Sharon Oard Warner's melodramatic first novel, ''Deep in the Heart.'' Set in Austin, Tex., the novel focuses primarily on a 40-year-old assistant high school principal named Hannah Solace, who is dismayed to learn that she is pregnant. Hannah is married to Carl, an artist and bookstore owner, and she had given up on the idea of raising a child and now feels too old for mothering; she's unsure that her faltering marriage could withstand it. The fact that Hannah's own mother died when Hannah was 11, leaving her to care for her younger sister, has also soured Hannah on raising a family, and although Carl desperately wants the baby, she proceeds with her plans for an abortion. In Hannah, Warner has created the prototypical ice queen, a woman who feels perfectly able to make such a weighty decision without her husband's consent or participation. Yet readers may also have difficulty fully sympathizing with Carl, who, despite his continuing love for his wife, can't seem to approach the matter directly -- that is, not until it is too late. Carl does attempt to protect his wife from the attacks of local anti-abortion forces, including Dr. Bill, an unconventional minister; a member of his congregation named Mattie; and Mattie's 23-year-old granddaughter, Penny, with whom Dr. Bill is in love. In the end, it seems that Warner has chosen Penny and Carl as the characters most likely to rise above their limitations, as Penny recoils from the ugliness of her fellow church members' tactics and Carl, after his marriage breaks up, leaves with hopes for new love.</p>
