      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I was in a supervisory position at a previous job and I had to inform a woman who was black that her position was being downgraded. She could either remain at the downgraded position or try to find another job within the company. She was understandably angry about the situation and filed a grievance against me, claiming racial discrimination. She cited 26 separate instances of discrimination. Everything was investigated, and all 26 instances were proved false when the claim went before the grievance council. I am not a racist, and to have someone falsely accuse me of being one tore at my emotions. The good ending is that, while we have both moved on to different jobs, we have managed to become friends again.</p>
