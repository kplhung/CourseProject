        <p>Francois Botha, who calls himself the White Buffalo, wore what appeared to be a white buffalo skin into the ring tonight. He should have been carried out on it.</p>
        <p>With a brutal left jab-right hand-left uppercut-right hand combination, Lennox Lewis retained his World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles tonight with a second-round knockout after Botha hardly threw a punch.</p>
        <p>''He caught me with a very good shot,'' Botha said. ''He's a very worthy champion.''</p>
        <p>According to the Compubox statistics, Botha connected with only 9 of his 37 punches, but none of those nine landed solidly. Lewis, in contrast, connected with 24 of his 47 punches, including an overhand right that staggered the South African near the end of the first round.</p>
        <p>''Lennox kept Botha in a zone where Botha couldn't fight and Lennox could fight,'' said Emanuel Steward, the champion's trainer. ''I was impressed with the way Lennox controlled the fight with his left jab.''</p>
        <p>Lewis, who was cheered by the 10,000 spectators at London Arena for his ''homecoming'' in the United Kingdom as champion, is 37-1-1 with 29 knockouts. Botha is 40-3-1 with 24 knockouts but has been stopped three times -- by Michael Moorer, Mike Tyson and now Lewis.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the cautious first round, Lewis staggered Botha with an overhand right to his blond goatee and mustache. Botha, who lives in Newport Beach, Calif., quickly regained his footing but was more intent on defense than on throwing any serious punches.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the second round, that left-right-left-right combination by Lewis put Botha through the ropes in Lewis's corner. Botha crawled back into the ring but the referee, Larry O'Connell, waved his arms after  2 minutes 39 seconds of the round. Botha did not protest.</p>
        <p>O'Connell, incidentally, was the judge who scored the debatable draw between Lewis and Evander Holyfield early last year at Madison Square Garden as just that -- a 12-round draw. When he was announced as the referee tonight, he was booed.</p>
        <p>''It was very special to come back home and show the people how much I've improved,'' said Lewis, alluding to his first fight in London since being knocked out by Oliver McCall in 1994. ''It was a good stoppage by the referee.</p>
        <p>''When the referee asked him to come forward, he was still wobbly.''</p>
        <p>Four years after earning the Olympic superheavyweight gold medal at Atlanta, 6-foot-7-inch Wladimir Klitschko, the 244 1/4-pounder from Kiev, Ukraine, moved closer to a World Boxing Association title shot with a seventh-round knockout of Monte Barrett of Greenville, N.C.</p>
        <p>As the No. 3-ranked heavyweight in the W.B.A. ranking, Klitschko loomed as a mandatory challenger to the winner of the Evander Holyfield-John Ruiz W.B.A. title bout Aug. 12 in Las Vegas. Klitschko is 33-1 with 32 knockouts. Barrett, who weighed 221 pounds, is 23-2 with 14 knockouts.</p>
        <p>But before and after tonight's title fight, Mike Tyson hung on the horizon with the charm of an approaching thunderstorm.</p>
        <p>When Lewis was asked after tonight's knockout if he had a message for Tyson, the champion said, ''Tell Mike to either put up or shut up.''</p>
        <p>After Tyson's 38-second knockout of Lou Savarese three weeks ago in Glasgow, the former champion challenged Lewis, snarling into a television microphone about how he wanted to ''eat'' Lewis's children. Still a bachelor at 34, Lewis has no children.</p>
        <p>''Tyson talked about how he's the best since Jack Dempsey,'' Lewis said, ''but he's not even the best in this era. Evander Holyfield beat him twice.''</p>
        <p>Even though Lewis has a mandatory I.B.F. title defense scheduled against David Tua of New Zealand in November (possibly in Toronto), Lewis has acknowledged that Tyson may be a future opponent.</p>
        <p>Lewis's promoter, Panos Eliades, said he had offered Tyson $25 million and a $5 million bonus.</p>
        <p>But no matter where or when Lewis fights Tyson, it is doubtful if the bout would be in Britain.</p>
        <p>Tyson is more a persona non grata than ever in Britain after two farcical appearances -- a second-round knockout of the incompetent Julius Francis in London on Jan. 29, and the ridiculously quick knockout of Savarese during which Tyson pushed the referee to the canvas.</p>
        <p>For all of Tyson's talk, he also acknowledged that he was ''not ready'' for a title bout.</p>
        <p>His next opponent is expected to be Andrew Golota, the Polish heavyweight with a history of below-the-belt punches -- the perfect lighted match to toss into the Tyson powder keg.</p>
