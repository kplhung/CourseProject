        <p>The escalating scuffle that left one suburban hockey dad dead and another charged with manslaughter last week was no isolated incident of rink rage gone mad. It was one of the more violent skirmishes in a battle for boyhood that is spreading across the fields of play.</p>
        <p>At a time when male adolescents have become a hot psychopolitical topic among feminists and antifeminists, it might be more useful to examine jock culture's role in boys' lives. The two fathers, acting out of their own ideas of how best to raise a boy, probably saw each other as threats not only to their sons but to images of manhood formed in their own boyhoods.</p>
        <p>The last time we looked in on the impact of jock culture on young people was right after the shooting deaths at Columbine High School last year. In an earlier version of thelipsite@aol.com, readers were invited to comment on the prevailing wisdom that the arrogant, entitled behavior of high school athletes, as encouraged by the parents, teachers and coaches who vicariously live through their overhyped deeds, created an everlasting divide; we identify ourselves as jocks (or their camp-followers) and outsiders (geeks, nerds, greasers, burnouts, etc.)</p>
        <p>The e-mail response was overwhelming, thoughtful and sometimes emotional, mostly from middle-aged men who remembered high school with still smoldering resentment against jocks. But former athletes wrote as well. Some of them remembered those years with guilt for bullying and hazing weaker kids, and with some shame for the way they had been humiliated by coaches. High school was too late to begin changing the pattern of abuse.</p>
        <p>''Think peewee leagues,'' says Dr. Michael Miletic, a Detroit-area psychiatrist who played hockey as a teenager in Canada and now watches his 12-year-old play. ''And it's not just the elite traveling teams. Even the house league teams become parents' teams. There are no easy solutions. These psychologists who tell you to monitor the coaches or pull the kids out are not realistic. They're certainly not at the rink.''</p>
        <p>They are in the bookstores, however, and on the lecture circuit in a somewhat simplistic frenzy of boy-watching that seems like a weak imitation of the ground-breaking books of a few years ago on adolescent females. The most popular is William Pollack's 1998 ''Real Boys,'' which describes its subjects as trapped against their will in the oppression of traditional masculinity.</p>
        <p>Of sports, Pollack writes: ''Sheer competition among boys rarely builds character and does little to bring boys closer to one another. But sports, when they are play, can be a tremendously good thing for boys.''</p>
        <p>Pollack's chief rival, Christina Hoff Sommers, offers even less in this year's ''The War Against Boys,'' which basically describes them as under siege by feminists who would unman them. Sommers manages to misinterpret the Glen Ridge (N.J.) rape case; what her agenda would list as suburban liberal permissiveness was actually the traditional deification of smalltown football players who were hollowed out by burdens they couldn't carry.</p>
        <p>Adults may be able to escape jock culture if they work at home or in the arts and avoid television and newspaper sports sections, but for most adults the harm or the health has already been bestowed. For boys, however, there is no escaping jock culture. And the potential for harm may be greater for young athletes.</p>
        <p>In Miletic's son's league, as he tells it, there is ''an overweight, not overbright coach who over and over sends out the dirtiest teams and no one does anything about it. For the same reasons the nonabusive spouse allows the kids to be abused. People are passive and they rationalize. They're in denial, they say: 'It'll stop. It's not so bad. It's a tough world out there and maybe this will make the boys ready for it.' ''</p>
        <p>Not all the background details are known of the incident in suburban Boston other than that the father who killed was demanding that the other father stop encouraging rough play among the boys.</p>
        <p>From a distance, Miletic can spin a sadly common scenario. A father-coach sends children out to be rough; he stirs their rage, establishes an opposing team as an enemy and provokes his boys not just to beat them but to dominate them. How much, asks Miletic, has this to do with strategy and how much to do with the coach's own feelings of smallness and submissiveness? How much has this to do with the way he was traumatized in childhood? And he is traumatizing another generation who will take it out in bullying other kids and eventually their own sons and players.</p>
        <p>Among Miletic's patients, who include professional athletes, is a 14-year-old boy who came to him suffering from depression. In the course of therapy, Miletic learned that the boy had been on a championship peewee football team in which the boys were abused after a loss or even a poor practice. Garbage pails were set out on the field and the boys were made to run around them until they were hanging over them, vomiting. The boy eventually quit the team, to his parents' anger and disappointment, but joined his high school team, where the abuse was somewhat less.</p>
        <p>''Then he broke his arm in practice,'' Miletic said. ''How convenient. And what relief he felt.''</p>
        <p>In the battle for boyhood, the broken arm was a real war's equivalent of the so-called million-dollar wound that sends you home.</p>
