        <p>Concert promoters had high hopes for what was billed as the first reunion of the Motown group the Supremes in three decades. They paid the former Supreme Diana Ross a guarantee reported to be between $15 million and $20 million and set a top ticket price around $250. But none of Ms. Ross's surviving former bandmates deigned to join her on the tour, claiming that their pay was too miniscule compared with hers. Though a date at Madison Square Garden on July 8 sold out, other arenas have been half or even three-quarters empty. Last week, Ms. Ross issued a press release stating that the tour had been canceled against her will. But SFX, the tour's promoter, despite calling off almost each concert at the last minute since then, claims that the tour is still happening, leaving ticket-holders grumbling, ''You Keep Me Hangin' On.''</p>
