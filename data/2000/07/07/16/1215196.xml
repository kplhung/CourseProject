        <p>If you're looking for inexpensive summer wines on the expensive South Fork, check out three at Duck Walk Vineyards.</p>
        <p>The sprawling winery, on the Montauk Highway in Water Mill, features a trio that, suitably, are named Windmill White, Windmill Blush and Windmill Red (no, not Moulin Rouge).</p>
        <p>If these names bring to mind bottles at Pindar Vineyards, in Peconic, on the North Fork -- Winter White, Summer Blush, Sweet Scarlett -- it's the Damianos populist touch.</p>
        <p>Dr. Herodotus Damianos -- Dan, to everyone -- owns both wineries; the Windmill series was made by his son Jason. North Fork sources supplied the grapes for the white and red; the grapes for the blush came from multiple sources.</p>
        <p>But grape sources are not critical here. Neither are vintages: none of the three wines are vintage-dated. As Jason Damianos observes, they are entry-level ''fun summer pool-side sippers and should be judged accordingly.'' So be it. Each bottle is $8 at the winery. ''You may find them in your local wine shop at $6 to $7 apiece,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Windmill White, semidry but ending dry, is an agreeable, simple, light carafe wine, a blend of chardonnay, sauvignon blanc and viognier for schmoozing and sipping when the house or lawn are full. Pineapple and apple pie aromas drift from the glass, implying, not surprisingly, total up-front appeal.</p>
        <p>Windmill Blush, amiable and easygoing, with a virtually candied confectionery strawberry aroma, is semidry and a semi-nosh. The grapes include merlot, cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon and pinot meunier. It is synonymous with picnic.</p>
        <p>Macho and brawny -- a mouthful, with minty and herbal notes -- Windmill Red, opened and poured 30 minutes before drinking, has a smoked-meat aroma to be savored. (The blend is cabernet franc, merlot and cabernet sauvignon.) Steak, roast beef or lamb need to enter its life.</p>
