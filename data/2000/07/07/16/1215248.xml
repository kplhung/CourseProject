        <p>THE first windows were holes in the walls that allowed an exchange of stagnant interior air with fresh outdoor air. Since they also allowed heat to escape they were probably small and covered with cloth, reed mats or leather. With the introduction of glass, windows became larger. These windows had to be custom made. Yet they were not well sealed, and they let cold drafts inside. Still a window was a valuable commodity, and in Colonial times homeowners would take their windows with them when they moved..</p>
        <p>Today, windows are mass produced from durable weather-resistant materials with five basic window styles: double hung, casement, awning, gliding and fixed.</p>
        <p>The double-hung window is the most popular. It consists of two sashes that slide up and down in a frame. Casement windows have sashes hinged at the top and bottom. They swing out (like a door) by means of a crank. Awning windows have sashes that are hinged at the top. They swing outward from the bottom and when open resemble a storefront awning. Gliding windows contain two sashes that slide horizontally in tracks in the frame. Fixed windows cannot open and are installed to provide a view (like picture windows) or as decorative accents (like oval or circular windows).</p>
        <p>Windows with metal frames are especially rugged, but some homeowners find they lack the warmth and elegance of wood frames. Many manufacturers offer windows made of wood but with exterior surfaces clad in maintenance-free vinyl or aluminum. Aluminum-  or vinyl-clad windows will cost more, but they will help save time and money, which would otherwise be needed later for scraping and repainting wooden sashes.</p>
        <p>Modern windows are more energy efficient than older windows. Manufacturers offer windows with thermal panes -- essentially an envelope of glass -- filled with inert argon gas.</p>
        <p>They also apply a low-E coating to the surface of the glass; it adds even more insulation value to the window. The low-E coating acts like an invisible two-sided mirror that reflects heat in either direction. During the summer, it reflects the hot rays from sun to keep them from entering the house. In the winter, the glass contains the house heat and helps keep fuel bills down.</p>
        <p>If you decide to buy a new window, you will need three measurements before you can place the order: the rough opening, the outside dimensions and the thickness of the wall.</p>
        <p>To find the rough opening, pry off the interior casing, then measure the distance between the studs on either side of the window and the distance between the rough sill and the header. Measure the height and width of the frame, that is, the dimensions of the jamb, to determine the outside dimensions. To find the thickness of the wall, poke a ruler in the gap between the stud and the window frame. Take the measurement from the leading edge of the stud (where the outside sheathing is mounted) to the interior edge of the wallboard. Take these measurements with you when you buy the new window; they will help the dealer select the ideal size for your opening.</p>
        <p>Once you buy a new window, you still have to install it. This is not a particularly difficult task if the size of the replacement is close to the old window. If it is larger, you will have to open up the wall. This will require carpentry skill. If the window is much smaller, you will have to close in the opening. This in itself is not difficult, but you will have to extend the exterior finish to the edge of the new window frame without making an eyesore of the repair.</p>
        <p>Before you can install the new window, you will have to remove the old one. From the inside pry off all the window trim, the casings and the stop molding, then remove the sashes. Most window frames are held in place with finishing nails that go through the inner and outer casings into the wall studs. When you remove the exterior casing (you already removed the inner when you pulled out the sashes), the window may be loose. If not, check to see if there are any finishing nails that go through the jamb into the studs. Cut these with a hacksaw blade, then pull the frame out.</p>
        <p>Working from the outside, use a stiff putty knife to gently pry up the siding and insert 30-pound asphalt impregnated building felt under the edges. Start at the bottom and work around the perimeter of the window. Staple the pieces in place as you insert them. The felt will keep moisture from penetrating the wall.</p>
        <p>Look at the top of the window opening. If there is no drip cap in place, install one. Slide the metal flange of the drip cap under the siding, but do not nail it. When the window is installed, the trim will hold it in place.</p>
        <p>Since the window frame will rest on the sill plate, it is a good idea to check to see if it is level. If it is not, add shims on the low end. Put the window in the opening; you may need a helper to hold it while you insert shims to get the window centered and leveled. From the exterior, measure around the window frame from the jamb to the edge of the siding. Use these figures to measure and cut the exterior trim molding. Remove the window and nail the trim molding to the jambs. Squeeze a bead of caulk around the wall opening in the area that will be covered by the overlapping trim molding.</p>
        <p>Put the window back into the opening and tack it in place by driving finishing nails through the trim into the wall. Do not drive the nails home. Leave the heads projecting out so you can remove the nails if necessary when you make further adjustments. (It is not necessary to nail exterior trim molding to aluminum or vinyl windows because they have nailing flanges attached to the window frame.)</p>
        <p>Use a level and a framing square to check that the window is level, plumb and square. If not, insert shims where necessary to correct the alignment. Open and close the window to make sure the sashes operate freely. If they do not, then the frame is probably out of square and needs further adjustment.</p>
        <p>When all adjustments are satisfactory, secure the window by driving 10d galvanized casing nails, spaced 16 inches apart, through the exterior trim into the wall. Seal the unit by drawing a bead of caulk around the perimeter of the trim.</p>
        <p>Working from the inside, fill the gaps between the jam and studs with fiberglass insulation. Do not pack too much in the gap or it could distort the frame. Fiberglass can irritate the skin, so wear long sleeves, gloves and a dust mask. Then reinstall the old interior trim or cut new pieces.</p>
