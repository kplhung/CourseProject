        <p>A FEW days ago in Barstow, Calif., a new museum opened. The Mother Road Museum, it's called, and it's all about Route 66, the famous artery that carried millions of people from the Midwest to Los Angeles. That's right: a museum dedicated to a highway.</p>
        <p>''What a moronic idea,'' says the morning-commute warrior in us, the one who equates ''highway'' with hell. Why commemorate a thing that brings us misery? It's like having a museum dedicated to gout.</p>
        <p>Then again, maybe not. Put a bit more thought into the matter and it is evident that perhaps there's nothing more deserving of historical recognition than a highway. Not only do we spend a huge amount of time, pleasantly or unpleasantly, on one road or another, but a road is also what ties communities and generations together across space and time.</p>
        <p>That notion has been taking hold among history types of late, including some in New Jersey, where getting from here to there has always been central to our self-definition. Five communities in Central Jersey are even trying to get a 10-mile stretch of the King's Highway (Routes 206 and 27) on the state and federal registers of historic sites, a designation usually reserved for buildings and battlefields.</p>
        <p>''Roads are the fleshed-out paragraphs of our history,'' said Frank Curcio of Annandale, who is active in the Lincoln Highway Association, which is dedicated to that legendary New York-to-San Francisco route. ''In contrast, battlefields and buildings and settlements are punctuation marks.''</p>
        <p>It's a relatively new wrinkle, this idea that a road can be a historic artifact, but it's catching on. There have been national conferences on Preserving the Historic Road in America, including one in New Jersey this past April. The general concept is that roads with a significant history should not be rerouted, overburdened, turned into de facto interstates, etc., without careful deliberation.</p>
        <p>It is, of course, an idea that runs smack up against our statewide sprawl and the constant clamor for better, wider roads to get us out of our perpetual traffic jam. And it generates the usual suspicions: is the concern really for history, or is it for keeping tractor-trailers out of the neighborhood?</p>
        <p>All of this is being played out in Lawrence, Princeton Township and Borough, South Brunswick and Franklin, where the proposal to list the King's Highway in the historic registers is going through a series of public meetings. The route, which began centuries ago as an Indian trail and has been traveled by Revolutionary armies and stagecoaches, runs through some of the most history-laden real estate in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''In a 10-mile stretch you have eight very important historic districts that either straddle the road, cross the road or abut the road,'' said Robert Craig of the state Historic Preservation Office.</p>
        <p>Those districts have been commemorated individually, but the road that links them has not been singled out for recognition or the protection that comes with it. If a road seems a bit mundane to be on the highbrow federal register, think of it this way: without the road, none of the historic villages and battle sites along it would have come into being.</p>
        <p>This may all seem like bureaucratic busywork, but from the historian's view, at least, there's a practical side: by memorializing a historic right of way, establishing it as a fixed route that can't be changed cavalierly, you pin down all the history that has grown up around it. When roads are altered, history tends to drift, as has become evident in another part of the state, the Monmouth Battlefield.</p>
        <p>Daniel Sivilich, who has been helping to map the battlefield and surrounding sites, said researchers regularly find examples of places that have been lost over time because roads are not where they once were. For instance, he said, remnants of a settlement called Squirreltown were found recently in a woods in Freehold. The settlement, which was apparently home to poor Irish and black residents, used to be on what is now Route 522, but when that road was moved years ago to make way for a railroad, Squirreltown vanished into the trees.</p>
        <p>Anyway, all of this is offered as food for thought next time you're waiting 40 minutes to pay a 35-cent Parkway toll. In the 24th century, what will tell people more about the irritating, absurd way we live, a well-preserved picture of Governor Whitman or a well-preserved tollbooth with attached traffic jam?</p>
        <p>Back in 1818, one frustrated traveler summed up his mud-delayed trip up the King's Highway thusly: ''The best horses and driver, and the worst roads I ever set my eyes on.''</p>
        <p>We're all his descendants. To paraphrase Bonnie Raitt, the road has always been our middle name.</p>
