        <p>Most African-American studies departments are really integrated, so I'm in a minority, but rarely the only white. Non-Americans and Americans who are not of black African ancestry have always been present in the field. It's fascinating -- the extent to which the students trust each other. There's more openness in the academic world. The term ''race'' is a European coinage that became popular in Spain during the Inquisition. It has largely been abandoned by 20th-century scientists. There's no biological concept of race that any scientist believes in. There's only racism. But the term is surprisingly alive in the U.S. It was startling, coming to the United States from Germany. The fact that the black-white divide still seems to carry so much meaning in the U.S. is something that I had to adjust to, something I still have difficulties adjusting to. The ethnic fault lines run in different directions in different countries. Many black American writers have viewed France as a haven from racism -- but North Africans tend to disagree. The black-white divide here is not as deep as the ethnic divide is among what would look like blacks in Rwanda and Burundi, or as the ethnic divide is among whites in Northern Ireland or in the Balkans. As academics, since we're specializing in the decoding of stereotypes, it would be hard for us to believe in them. But sometimes I'm expected to be superorganized since I was raised in Germany. That turns out not to be true.</p>
