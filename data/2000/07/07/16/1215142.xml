        <p>THOUGH John Hejduk was little known outside the world of architecture, his influence exceeded that of many of its most prominent figures. His death earlier this month, at 71, leaves a profound emptiness -- a quality that, as it happens, Hejduk often reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects, he was a contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work in a highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of living out the contradiction. Instead of constructing social spaces with bricks and mortar, he fashioned one from ideas and emotions and peopled it with students and faculty members of the school he led for 25 years.</p>
        <p>That institution, the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, must be in shock. The school had just begun to adjust to Hejduk's retirement as dean, announced only weeks before his death. Cooper Union without John Hejduk? Inconceivable. Even the Bauhaus was not as closely identified with its founder, Walter Gropius, as Cooper Union came to be with Hejduk. There stood, in one of Cooper's hallways, a large plaster model of the Pantheon, and the big white dome (you could stick your head in it) seemed to symbolize the hold of Hejduk's mind over his students and faculty.

        <p>THOUGH John Hejduk was little known outside the world of architecture, his influence exceeded that of many of its most prominent figures. His death earlier this month, at 71, leaves a profound emptiness -- a quality that, as it happens, Hejduk often reflected on in his work. Like many gifted architects, he was a contradictory figure: a solitary artist who chose to work in a highly social form of art. But he had a particular way of living out the contradiction. Instead of constructing social spaces with bricks and mortar, he fashioned one from ideas and emotions and peopled it with students and faculty members of the school he led for 25 years.</p>
        <p>That institution, the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, must be in shock. The school had just begun to adjust to Hejduk's retirement as dean, announced only weeks before his death. Cooper Union without John Hejduk? Inconceivable. Even the Bauhaus was not as closely identified with its founder, Walter Gropius, as Cooper Union came to be with Hejduk. There stood, in one of Cooper's hallways, a large plaster model of the Pantheon, and the big white dome (you could stick your head in it) seemed to symbolize the hold of Hejduk's mind over his students and faculty. Those who entered the school's Foundation Building, remodeled by Hejduk in 1975, were essentially walking into the architect's psyche, to have their brains remodeled as well.</p>
        <p>He took architecture inside, too. Interiority, in fact, is what bound this tall, singular fellow to his contemporaries. He was one of a group of architects whose work has punched holes in the wall between our outer and inner worlds. Ordinarily, architecture reinforces that wall. Compared with writing, painting or music, architecture is typically seen as an art that operates ''out there.'' It is a material art. It accommodates people and their social behavior. It is not confined by the frames, prosceniums, book covers and other devices that separate art from daily life.</p>
        <p>Hejduk took a different route. Along with Aldo Rossi, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and others, he helped to break down the separation by asserting that personal expression is a legitimate response to urban context. This is one of the lessons Hejduk imparted to his disciples.</p>
        <p>Even compared to them, however, his individuality remained extreme. Whether or not he ever set his heart on building in the material world, at some point he let that goal slip away. Instead of reckoning with the pragmatic considerations and compromises of conventional practice, he dedicated himself almost entirely to a dual practice of running a school and making architecture in the form of drawings.</p>
        <p>The pivotal project in his architectural work was ''Wall House I,'' a design for a three-story house hanging off a five-story wall, which he began in 1974. From the drawings and models, it is evident that he saw this as a buildable project. It includes structural supports, habitable spaces and essential functions and takes its name from its central element: a concrete wall five stories high, somewhat larger in width. One model suggests that the rear of the wall is backed with reflective steel. On the front, a bean-shaped elevator core supports the wall, from which a staircase and three floors of living space are cantilevered.</p>
        <p>The project should not be seen, however, as an exercise in structural calisthenics. It is, rather, a meditation on the border between public and private space. The design compresses the private dwelling from a box to a plane. The compression isolates the division of private and public. The cantilevered floors, horizontal planes, create semi-private zones within. The open staircase, extruded through the wall, is semi-public.</p>
        <p>The design was prophetic. It anticipated our national debate over the relationship between public and private realms. Ordinarily, when we use the term visionary architect, we mean someone who creates strictly imaginary worlds. In the case of the ''Wall House,'' the term can be used factually. Hejduk set forth an issue that in 1998 hijacked the Oval Office, turning privacy into publicity.</p>
        <p>From here, his work pivoted into the visionary as the term is more conventionally construed. Some buildings would come: a housing complex in Berlin; part of a cultural complex in Spain due for completion this year. But to those outside Cooper Union, Hejduk would be known for suites of drawings like the ''Lancaster/Hanover Masque,'' completed in 1982. Symbolically charged, arranged in narrative form, this project featured a cast of architectural protagonists -- the Accused, the Balloonist, the Retired Judge -- in a brooding, Expressionist townscape.</p>
        <p>Hejduk did not project his sensibility deeply into the material world. Others have done this for him. In his design for the Jewish Museum in Berlin, Daniel Libeskind, a former Hejduk student, has created as powerful an architectural experience as can be seen in that city today. Visitors are stunned by the building's climactic space: a soaring, crepuscular chamber with walls and floor of stark concrete, entered through a tall metal door that clangs shut. Designed to convey the sense of helpless isolation experienced by Holocaust victims, this Kafkaesque environment embodies Hejduk's bleaker visions.</p>
        <p>Libeskind's project is not derivative. Nor is the Austrian Cultural Institute, designed by Raimund Abraham, a professor at Cooper Union. With its facade of sharply angled glass panels, Abraham's slim tower (now nearing completion on East 52nd Street) owes as much to the surrealist architect Frederick Kiesler as to Hejduk. But Hejduk, like Kiesler, created a context that helps clarify Abraham's aesthetic intentions.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Diller, another student, and her partner, Ricardo Scofidio, a Cooper professor, have taken other aspects of Hejduk's work in sparkling new directions. The two share his preoccupation with the metaphysics of form and materials: opening and enclosure, transparency and opacity, differentiation and merger, distance and duration. Diller and Scofidio analyze such characteristics in terms of their social, psychological and even political values before considering the functional and visual properties of walls, windows and doors.</p>
        <p>MORE important, Hejduk inspired Diller and Scofidio to pursue the concept of alternative practice. Though the two have several buildings to their credit, and more are in the works, they have presented their ideas primarily in museum installations, performances, books and electronic media, as well as in their careers as teachers. They have conveyed to a larger audience the idea that architecture operates by changing consciousness as well as by reorganizing the physical world.</p>
        <p>I like the mess and compromise that goes with conventional practice. The smell of concrete dust, the look of scaffolds and wiring hanging out of the walls, the vertigo of riding in a construction elevator, the curiosity of sidewalk superintendents, the wear and tear that goes with usage, the difference between renderings and realities: all this is part of the art of architecture as I see it. I am awed by the power of a building to be simultaneously a metaphor and a pile of stuff. The stuff itself has metaphoric value.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, and others, I once went into attack mode over Hejduk's withdrawal from practice. I don't regret a word of the column, which appeared in Artforum in 1988. It is a critic's business to throw light on the dark side of the moon, even if the bright side is enchanting. And 1988 was a moment to face a disconcerting truth: when talented people retreat from the marketplace, the clunks rush in to take their places. Isn't there a point at which an architect's solitary pursuit slips into self-indulgence?</p>
        <p>The clunks are still rushing in. Too many talented people are still sitting by passively, waiting for their ships to come in. Too many untalented people have come to equate passivity with genius. Too many firms complain that Cooper graduates are unemployable. I'll reserve my highest respect for architects who like to mess around with stuff.</p>
        <p>But it's also true that the vitality of the city now rests on ''alternative practices.'' The city itself has become an alternative way of life. Creativity is inherently alternative, whether it turns up in a mainstream firm or a third-year studio. John Hejduk won't let us forget that.</p>
