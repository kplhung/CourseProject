        <p>THE belief that anyone can grow rich in America took root even before the colonies decided to become a nation.

        <p>THE belief that anyone can grow rich in America took root even before the colonies decided to become a nation. This faith has outlasted innumerable depressions, recessions, inflations and deflations, and today, with somewhere between 4 million and 5 million millionaires in the country, more than 4 percent of all households, it seems stronger than ever.</p>
        <p>It's wise to keep this fiscal theology in mind when trying to understand the push Congressional Republicans are making to repeal the estate tax -- and the unexpectedly wide support they've garnered, both in Congress and among many Americans. The Senate voted 59 to 39 on Friday to repeal the tax over 10 years, at an estimated cost of $104 billion in lost revenue over the next decade, and $750 billion the decade after. In June, the House, including 63 Democrats, voted 279 to 136 for repeal.</p>
        <p>President Woodrow Wilson signed the estate tax into law in 1916 to help finance World War I and, to some degree, soak the rich. Its supporters extended from Theodore Roosevelt to Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Lyndon B. Johnson, who believed the tax would narrow the chasm between rich and poor.</p>
        <p>In this tradition, President Clinton has vowed to veto a repeal as a handout to the rich, money he says could be better used to pay for prescriptions for the elderly. But the Republicans are betting that the days are over for class warfare over taxes, and they may be right. Attitudes have changed as the investor class has swelled and ordinary Americans play the stock market.</p>
        <p>Even though only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who die each year would benefit if the tax were repealed, a remarkable 60 percent of Americans support repeal, according to a June Gallup poll. In another example of optimism outrunning reality, 17 percent of those polled thought the tax would apply to them.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people who do not have estates large enough to be taxed are worrying that someday down the road they will,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group. The ranks of the worried are swelling along with real estate prices in prosperous suburbs and urban neighborhoods from Florida to Boston to Chicago.</p>
        <p>Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a liberal New York Democrat who might have been expected to oppose repeal, instead embraces it. '' Maybe 5 and 10 years ago it didn't make sense, but it does make sense today given the reality of the real estate market and the fast-growing values of small business,'' she said. ''This represents a real financial burden on a lot of people.''</p>
        <p>It is another measure of just how popular the issue has become that the Democrats felt compelled to offer a compromise, which would have reduced the tax, not abolished it. That was voted down on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Under current law, estates are generally exempt from federal taxation up to $675,000, an amount scheduled to climb to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3 million. The tax, which hit 47,596 estates in 1997 (out of the 2.3 million Americans who died), starts at 37 percent and climbs to a maximum of 55 percent.</p>
        <p>Defenders of the tax see it as a tool for raising revenues and, more fundamentally, for narrowing the nation's economic inequities. To hear them talk, the only people who pay it are billionaires like Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists for repeal, however, condemn what they see as a death tax that socks mostly farmers and small businesses, hard-working people who have pulled themselves up, creating wealth and jobs.</p>
        <p>''I thought government was supposed to protect our property, not confiscate it, not penalize someone because they've been successful,'' said Senator Don Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the tax point out that estate tax payments by farmers represent only 1 percent of the taxes paid.</p>
        <p>''The other side has done a pretty good job of selling it, in pretending that it's the little guys who pay it,'' said Robert McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a Washington-based advocacy group that wants to retain the tax.</p>
        <p>Charles Davenport, a tax expert at Rutgers University in Newark, said repealing the tax would mean a $7 million tax cut for the top one-tenth of one percent of families. ''Why is it that the people who have enjoyed the greatest run-up in wealth in the last decade deserve a tax break now of this amount?'' he said. ''There's no compelling argument.''</p>
        <p>Supporters of repeal make their own arguments about fairness. They charge unfair double taxation, noting that much of the wealth hit by the inheritance tax has already been subject to income and capital gains taxes. More ingeniously, repealers make what might be called a stupidity argument. They claim the tax is unfair because as the economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell once wrote, it is ''imposed on those who neglect to plan ahead or retain unskilled estate planners.'' Mr. Bartlett, the tax expert, said, ''It's a tax on ignorance.''</p>
        <p>Finally, according to many analysts, it is no coincidence that the push to abolish the tax has picked up steam at the same time that millionaires are playing an increasingly dominant role in financing campaigns.</p>
        <p>Edward McCaffery, a law professor at the University of Southern California who favors eliminating the tax, said that the mere threat of repeal is good for Republican and Democrat alike.</p>
        <p>''It keeps the campaign contributions coming in,'' he said. ''You don't need a lot of people who care about this issue because the people who care about it have a lot of money.''</p>
