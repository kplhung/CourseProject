        <p>Juli Inkster's biggest decision today, like that of many parents, was what to do with her two young daughters on a rainy afternoon in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>Inkster, the winner of three major championships over the past 19 months, had plenty of time on her hands because the third round of the Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic had been postponed by heavy rains.</p>
        <p>Should the children continue to play with the four sons of Frank and Lynnie Mara, with whom Inkster and her family have been staying in Port Chester, or should they venture into Manhattan to a museum?</p>
        <p>The decision: let the kids draw up a storm with acrylic paints on glass while Inkster and the Maras -- Frank Mara is the son of the Giants co-owner Wellington Mara -- joined in the fun.</p>
        <p>Later, Inkster and her daughters, Hayley Carol, 10, and Cori Simpson, 6, were to have dinner in Manhattan in Little Italy and then see the musical ''Swing.''</p>
        <p>''Me and the girls are having a great time,'' said Inkster, who marked her 40th birthday on June 24 by winning the McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship, one of the circuit's four majors, for the second year in a row. ''We have dinner together every night and are getting to see some of the sights.''</p>
        <p>The role of working mom seems to suit Inkster, who lives in Los Altos, Calif. Her daughters sometimes accompany her to tournaments, as was the case at the McDonald's, the sixth major she has won. ''I'm even going to take them to the British and Swedish Opens this summer,'' said Inkster, who will be the defending champion when the United States Women's Open begins Thursday in Libertyville, Ill.</p>
        <p>First, though, Inkster would like to win her second Big Apple Classic -- she was a wire-to-wire winner in 1992 -- when the tournament resumes, weather permitting, on Sunday morning at Wykagyl Country Club. That will be a daunting task, however, because Inkster, at one-over-par 143, trails the second-round leader, Allison Finney, by 10 strokes. Annika Sorenstam is in second place, one stroke behind Finney.</p>
        <p>Inkster, Sorenstam and Karrie Webb have come to dominate women's golf, but they have also given the L.P.G.A. keen competition at its highest level. Webb, 25, and Sorenstam, 29, have both won four tournaments this year. Inkster has won twice. Inkster has 24 career titles, Sorenstam 22 and Webb 20.</p>
        <p>''I certainly try to keep up with them, but I don't see myself involved in any kind of rivalry with Annika and Karrie,'' Inkster said. ''After all, we're from two different eras; they're in their 20's, and I'm 40.''</p>
        <p>Maybe so, but Inkster is in the top three with Webb and Sorenstam in several statistical categories on the L.P.G.A. circuit, including scoring average, rounds under par, top 10 finishes and earnings.</p>
        <p>Inkster, who is outgoing, witty and not afraid to show her emotions on the course, could hardly be more different in personality than the cool, analytical Sorenstam, who won back-to-back U.S. Opens in 1995 and 1996, and the equally low-key Webb, who has captured two majors.</p>
        <p>''When we're playing together -- and I like it when Annika and Karrie are in the field with me -- I feel I have as good a shot as they do to win,'' said Inkster, who is one of only two women (Pat Bradley is the other) to win the modern-day career Grand Slam. ''I think it brings out the best in me.''</p>
        <p>''But nowadays, with my daughters and my husband, who travels with me to some of my tournaments, golf has become secondary,'' Inkster said. ''I still work as hard as ever and I would love to win another Open. If anything, it's easier when I have the girls along because they take my mind off of my golf, and I'm more relaxed when I play. That wasn't the case when I was a young player. We have a lot of fun together, and when I'm with them I totally forget about golf.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Because of today's rainout, the tournament has been reduced to 54 holes. If rain washes out play on Sunday, the tournament will continue on Monday, but only if all 70 players have completed at least nine holes. If they have not, it will be considered a 36-hole tournament, meaning that ALLISON FINNEY would win her first tournament since 1989.  . . . This is the last time that Japan Airlines will be the tournament sponsor. Officials of Golf Magazine, which owns the tournament, have said it will continue under a new sponsor, who has yet to be determined.</p>
