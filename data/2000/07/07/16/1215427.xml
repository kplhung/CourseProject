        <p>STARTLING as life in the subatomic realm can seem, with particles existing both here and there or darting to and fro at the same time, people have been able to take some small comfort in knowing that the ''real'' world doesn't work that way. Though made of the very same stuff that marches to the dictates of quantum theory -- the laws that explain how particles behave -- solid objects obediently occupy one place at a time and are never seen moving in two directions at once. It may be hard to tell whether a torpid cat, barely blinking its eyes, remains among the living. But that is a far cry from the mythical cat in the physicist Erwin Schrodinger's oft-recited thought experiment, which is placed in a state of being dead and alive at the same time.</p>
        <p>When quantum rules are applied to the domain of creatures and things, the result is nonsense. ''When I hear about Schrodinger's Cat,'' Stephen Hawking once grumpily declared, ''I reach for my gun.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the taunting feline (along with the image of Dr. Hawking pulling a revolver from a holster on his wheelchair and blasting the poor kitty to bits) was evoked once again. Experimenters at the State University of New York at Stonybrook showed more decisively than ever that quantum effects can indeed exist in the larger world -- you just have to know how to look for them.</p>
        <p>One of the most pressing questions in science is why the universe seems to operate according to two sets of laws. If scientists are so sure of quantum theory, one of their proudest creations, then why is it so flagrantly spurned here in the ordinary world? The new experiment may nudge theorists closer to an answer.</p>
        <p>While physicists have yet to produce a quantum cat or even a quantum microbe, the Stonybrook team showed that a tiny wire loop a little wider than a human hair -- but monstrous by subatomic standards -- can indeed hover in the kind of ambiguous state Schrodinger puzzled over. As reported in the British journal Nature, the researchers cooled the ring to near absolute zero and showed that a current consisting of billions of electrons could be coaxed to spin around it in two directions at once, clockwise and counterclockwise.</p>
        <p>Other scientists had already demonstrated that single atoms or molecules could be placed in the catlike condition known as quantum superposition. By achieving what is known in the trade as a macroscopic quantum state, the Stonybrook researchers have raised the bar much higher. As a headline in Nature put it, ''Schrodinger's cat is now fat.''</p>
        <p>Most physicists, in fact, are surer than ever that everything, no matter how portly, is quantum at heart. Why then don't we see these weird juxtapositions?</p>
        <p>In Schrodinger's fantasy, a cat is placed in a box with a vial of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas and a lump of some radioactive substance like uranium. If the uranium decays, it will shoot out a piece of nuclear shrapnel, triggering a Rube Goldberg device that smashes the vial and releases the poison. With a 50-50 chance that this reaction will occur, Schrodinger proposed, the cat could be thought of as being simultaneously dead and alive.</p>
        <p>Schrodinger was perfectly aware that when he opened the box and peered inside, the cat would have to be one way or the other. Some physicists have proposed that it is the very act of observation that conjures up the hard edges of the familiar world. Most theorists insist that the observation need not be made by a conscious being -- an insentient measuring device will do. Hook an electroencephalograph to the cat to monitor its brainwaves and the continuous act of measurement would keep it from slipping into quantum limbo. Or would the EEG itself fall into an ambiguous state, its needle twitching out ''dead'' and ''alive'' at the same time? Then something would have to observe it. Dr. Hawking, get your gun.</p>
        <p>It has been tempting to think that as things get bigger, quantum effects somehow disappear on their own. But that begs the question of where nature draws the line. With more and more evidence that size doesn't matter, other ideas are gaining ground. Maybe the quantum fuzz snaps into focus when a collection of particles passes some threshold of complexity.</p>
        <p>Most bets now are being laid on a different possibility: that it is simply the interaction with an environment that solidifies the macroscopic world. The particles that make up the cat are constantly jostling each other and being bombarded with air molecules and photons of light. These tiny ''measurements'' may be all that's needed to keep Schrodinger's Cat at bay.</p>
        <p>The feline would be in good company, with everything in the universe -- stars and trees as well as scientists -- engaged in a buzzing orgy of mutual measurement, keeping the cosmos in line.</p>
