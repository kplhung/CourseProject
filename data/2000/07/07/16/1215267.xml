        <p>Since the stuttered start of New Jersey's new inspection program in December, it has been perceived as an apocalpyse with a tailpipe by many of those who have had to wait in line for hours for the state's seal of approval.</p>
        <p>But federal regulators, state officials and environmental and health advocates around the country say that New Jersey's experience is not so different than that of other states.</p>
        <p>New Jersey, like every other state, is required to reduce smog-causing emissions under amendments to the federal Clean Air Act approved by Congress in 1990. And most states, just like New Jersey, have chosen to target automobile emissions as the main source of air pollution.</p>
        <p>While the state's problems have been very real -- the privatization of operations at 32 state-owned inspection stations remains under investigation by a state panel -- the long lines, equipment failures and delayed implementation of crucial elements have plagued other states as well.</p>
        <p>The problems in some states, particularly  Texas, have been costly and make New Jersey's situation seem almost trivial by comparison.</p>
        <p>''In terms of how many other states have had problems?'' said Mary Ellen Cervantes, a spokeswoman for the federal Environmental Protection Agency. ''I would say just about all of them.''</p>
        <p>While Governor Whitman has made some policy and personnel changes to minimize inconveniences, recent polls suggest that New Jerseyans, with a love of sport utility vehicles and disdain toward car pooling, might have added patience when it comes to waiting in line for the sake of clean air.</p>
        <p>The average waiting time for inspections in June, by the way, was 9 minutes, down from 26 in January, which probably compares favorably with any McDonald's drive-through during lunch hour.</p>
        <p>As for the public's attitude toward the emissions program, a poll made public this month by Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, commissioned by The Star-Ledger of Newark, found that 8 in 10  respondents supported the enhanced inspection program. Among the 206 respondents who actually had their cars inspected under the new program, 52 percent said they were ''very satisfied'' with the experience.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised,'' said Rachel Askew, a researcher who worked on the poll, which was titled, ''DMV Inspection Nightmare? Only a Dream!''</p>
        <p>In Texas, officials did not merely delay implementation of the enhanced inspection program in 1995, they scrapped it entirely as it was set to begin. Critics called it a short-term concession to convenience that turned out to have a significant cost to the environment and to taxpayers. When Texas legislators and the governor, George W. Bush, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, repealed the law that included the enhanced inspections, they reneged on a contract that had already been signed with a company called Tejas Testing Technology. Tejas has since gone bankrupt, but only after suing the state and receiving a settlement of $140 million, most of which was paid from a state environmental cleanup fund.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Texas did not make up for reduction in emissions that was supposed to have been achieved, and Houston has since surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the nation.</p>
        <p>Ken Kramer, director of the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club, said the repeal was in response to passions whipped up by a libertarian talk radio host, ''who started razzing folks about the inspection system being an inconvenience to motorists.''</p>
        <p>''It's not my sense that, other than that situation in Houston, where it was sort of being fomented by that talk radio personality, that there was that much of a backlash,'' Mr. Kramer said of most motorists' attitudes toward the emissions program. ''I just think it was one of those things where what people thought was public opinion was really just a couple of loud people.''</p>
        <p>In Georgia, state officials did launch an enhanced inspection program in 1997, which, like New Jersey's, featured a dynamometer emissions test that replaced a less stringent idle test. But again, like New Jersey, Georgia officials suspended use of the dynamometer test when problems with it led to long lines at inspection stations. The three manufacturers hired by the state -- including Environmental System Products, commonly known as ESP, of East Grouby, Conn., a subcontractor of the company awarded New Jersey's inspection contract, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group -- could not address the problems fast enough.</p>
        <p>Michael Halicki, a spokesman for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, said ESP could not move quickly enough because the manufacturers were busy with other states trying to get their new programs rolling. ''We had some real long lines at inspection stations,'' Mr. Halicki said. Since then, he added, the kinks have been worked out, and the program has been reducing emissions in Georgia.</p>
        <p>Michigan scrapped plans for an enhanced inspection system altogether several years ago, and instead is challenging the goals by the federal environmental agency, said Alison Horton, the state's Sierra Club president.</p>
        <p>Even a pending lawsuit by 1,400 service station owners in New Jersey is not unique. The station owners here have sued the state, claiming they lost money on investments of $50,000 or more for new testing equipment after the state reverted to the less-stringent emissions test, creating a disincentive for motorists to get their vehicles inspected at the private service stations, which, unlike the central stations, charge a fee.</p>
        <p>In New York State, disgruntled service station owners filed suit last March. The difference was that their suit was against three manufacturers of testing equipment, claiming that many cars were falsely passing the new emissions test. Consequently, the New York service stations asserted, they were not getting sufficient repair work on failing cars to pay off their investments.</p>
        <p>The effect of all the hubbub surrounding the emissions testing difficulties, said Paul Billings, assistant vice president for governmental relations at the American Lung Association, is to create ''a huge distraction'' from the whole point of the enhanced inspection program -- to clean the air.</p>
        <p>''I've heard these anecdotal things, where cars have flown off the dynamometer, or tire damage,'' Mr. Billings said, ''and they are extremely rare cases. But they seem to get reported with great vigor. It sells a lot of papers, I guess. And fans the flames.</p>
        <p>''There have been difficulties in starting up the program in a number of states,'' he added, ''but once they've gotten through this initial transition period, they've generally been well received. A lot of this opposition has been generated by people with an agenda against the clean air act. A lot of it has been generated by talk radio: 'How dare they touch my car!' ''</p>
        <p>With at least one exception -- making up for a test to detect leaky exhaust systems that was suspended -- New Jersey's enhanced inspection program is scheduled to be in full effect on Aug. 1, with all 127 existing inspection lanes using the dynamometer emissions test. On that day, a system of inspections by appointmentwill be available at all seven state facilities.</p>
        <p>Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman, said the governor was not surprised by the Eagleton poll results showing drivers not being particularly perturbed by the new system or its kinks.</p>
        <p>''The poll is consistent with what she had been hearing from people as she travelled around the state,'' Ms. O'Connor said. ''Despite the problems that we had with the system in December -- that Parsons had with the system in December -- the system was on the right track.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, that seemed to be the case at a state testing center in Jersey City one recent afternoon, where motorists kept their cool despite the blistering heat.</p>
        <p>''It didn't take as long as I thought it would take, and I passed, so I'm pleased,'' said Cassaundra Spann, 31, of Jersey City, a contract auditor, who was driving a 1997 Acura. ''I'm off today, that's another reason why it may not seem so long.''</p>
        <p>Albert Vega, 49, of Bayonne, a nurse's aide who was waiting for his wife's 1995 Saturn to be inspected, said he had been there 45 minutes, but even that did not strike him as excessive.</p>
        <p>''Most people, I don't think they pay much attention to it,'' said Mr. Vega, who did not even begrudge the inspection system after his own car, a 1985 Toyota, had failed because of a faulty emergency brake.</p>
        <p>He said he was not only grateful to learn of the problem, but was relieved that the repair bill was just $90. ''I was happy about that,'' Mr. Vega said. ''It's a good thing that the cars are being tested. You want to keep the air clean. You know, you've got to take the bad with the good.''</p>
