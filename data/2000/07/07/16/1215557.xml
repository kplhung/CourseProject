        <p>Jane Gottlieb letter holds July 9 article on Venus Williams' Wimbledon title victory should have focused on her performance and mental toughness1</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>While I agree that the historic significance of Venus Williams's Wimbledon title cannot be overstated, I believe that her ground strokes, remarkable court coverage and mental toughness during her victory over Lindsay Davenport deserve at least as much attention as the absence of her hair beads, those long practices in Compton, Calif., and her father's tap dancing from the stands that dominated The Times's coverage of the match (''Venus Williams Wins Wimbledon, Lighting Up Center Court,'' July 9).</p>
        <p>This was foremost an athletic event. Like the preview of the men's final, the report should have been an analysis of the strategy, execution, strengths and weaknesses of the finalists. I would hope the final of a major tournament would warrant more detail on the mechanics of play, not just the factors that brought Williams to center court.</p>
