        <p>David Wells lost for the first time in almost two months, and the newly acquired Bruce Chen pitched five scoreless innings as visiting Philadelphia defeated Toronto last night, 7-3.</p>
        <p>Wells (15-3), who started for the American League in the All-Star Game last Tuesday night, had won his previous eight decisions. His last loss came on May 20 against the Chicago White Sox.</p>
        <p>Wells gave up six runs against the Phillies, tying a season high. He allowed eight hits in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Chen (5-0), acquired from Atlanta along with the lefty Jim Osting for Andy Ashby last Wednesday, allowed just three hits in his first start since last Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old left-hander, on a strict pitch count, struck out three and walked none. He threw 66 pitches, 42 for strikes.</p>
        <p>Ron Gant drove in three runs for the Phillies. He hit a two-run homer off Wells in the seventh for a 6-3 lead.</p>
        <p>Scott Rolen had three hits, including a solo home run in the second. Rolen had a run-scoring double in the fourth, then Wells hit Mike Lieberthal with a pitch before Kevin Jordan had a run-scoring single for a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Gant's sacrifice fly in the fifth made the score 4-0.</p>
        <p>CUBS 8, TWINS 4: Sammy Sosa tied Joe DiMaggio for 50th place on the career home run list, hitting</p>
        <p>No. 361 as visiting Chicago beat Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Sosa connected in the second inning against Joe Mays for his 25th home run of the season. He homered for the second straight day, and has hit four in eight games.</p>
        <p>Sosa's presence boosted the crowd to 36,688, the Twins' largest at home since opening day.</p>
        <p>Kevin Tapani (6-7) pitched eight innings. He gave up 12 hits, but helped himself by striking out nine and walking none.</p>
        <p>The Cubs won two of three at the Metrodome after taking two of three against the White Sox. The Cubs have won consecutive series for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>Matt Lawton went 4 for 4 with a homer and three runs batted in for Minnesota, which lost for the ninth time in 11 games.</p>
        <p>BRAVES 7, ORIOLES 3: Tom Glavine pitched seven strong innings to earn his third straight victory and Javy Lopez homered as visiting Atlanta finished a three-game sweep of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The interleague game drew 49,013 fans, the largest regular-season crowd in the nine-year history of Camden Yards. They saw the Orioles yield 11 hits, commit 2 errors and fall 13 games under .500 (38-51), tying a season high.</p>
        <p>Glavine (10-5) allowed one earned run and seven hits, walking none and striking out three. The left-hander has won his last three starts after going 0-4 over a seven-game stretch from May 26 to June 27.</p>
        <p>INDIANS 6, PIRATES 4: Travis Fryman drove in three runs to help host Cleveland win and complete a three-game sweep of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>All four Pittsburgh runs came on homers. Tike Redman, John Vander Wal, Jason Kendall and Wil Cordero hit the solo shots off Cleveland starter Jim Brower.</p>
        <p>The three-game sweep was the first by an A.L. team over the Pirates since interleague play began in 1997.</p>
        <p>Jamie Brewington (3-0) got the victory by pitching one and one-third scoreless innings of relief. He struck out Vander Wal with two runners on base in the fifth and fanned Kendall with two on in the sixth to preserve the 6-4 lead.</p>
        <p>Jaime Navarro, Paul Shuey and Steve Karsay each pitched one scoreless inning. Karsay got his 18th save.</p>
        <p>TIGERS 11, ASTROS 6: Brad Ausmus hit a two-run single in a seven-run seventh inning that rallied host Detroit past Houston.</p>
        <p>Ausmus went 3 for 3 and drove in three runs against his former team.</p>
        <p>Jose Lima, traded from Detroit to the Astros in December 1996 in the deal that included Ausmus, left with a 5-4 lead despite allowing 10 hits in six innings.</p>
        <p>Looking for his second straight victory after 13 consecutive losses, he wound up with a no-decision. The Astros' bullpen collapsed in the seventh as the Tigers tagged four relievers for five hits, two walks and two sacrifice flies en route to an 11-5 lead.</p>
        <p>EXPOS 4, DEVIL RAYS 1: Dustin Hermanson pitched seven and one-third strong innings and visiting Montreal broke a four-game losing streak with a victory over Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Hermanson (7-7) shut out the Devil Rays on five hits before giving up a run in the eighth. The closer Steve Kline got the last five outs for his 12th save.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Guerrero drove in two runs with sacrifice flies and the Expos scored an unearned run in the second inning off Steve Trachsel (6-9).</p>
        <p>Jose Guillen was thrown out at the plate on play in which Montreal catcher Chris Widger suffered a mild concussion in the third. Greg Vaughn led off the fourth with a double, but couldn't score on John Flaherty's two-out single.</p>
        <p>Guillen, attempting to score from second on Gerald Williams's single, appeared to catch Widger in the side of the head with his knee when he slammed into the catcher, who was blocking the plate.</p>
        <p>Widger held onto the throw from left fielder Terry Jones and Guillen was called out.</p>
        <p>WHITE SOX 15, CARDINALS 7: Frank Thomas hit a three-run homer in the first inning and a bases-loaded double in the seventh, matching a career high with six R.B.I. as host Chicago routed the St. Louis to snap a four-game skid.</p>
        <p>Thomas's 28th homer followed a walk to Ray Durham and single by Jose Valentin in the first. His double down the third-base line cleared the bases in the seventh and gave him 83 R.B.I., six more than last season.</p>
        <p>Jim Parque (9-2) won his sixth straight decision and hasn't lost since May 17. He allowed five hits and four runs -- three earned -- in five innings.</p>
        <p>Darryl Kile (11-6) lasted just four and two-thirds innings, surrendering eight hits and six runs, and also was involved in the most heated incident of the night.</p>
        <p>After Fernando Tatis, who homered twice Thursday night, was hit by a pitch for the third time in the series, Kile drilled Magglio Ordonez in the back in the bottom half of the inning, the fifth.</p>
        <p>Chicago Manager Jerry Manuel went to the plate to check on Ordonez, who was writhing on the ground, and began screaming at Kile.</p>
        <p>St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa then became animated, but it was not clear if his comments were directed at Manuel or home plate umpire Alfonso Marquez.</p>
        <p>Ordonez took first, Paul Konerko singled him to third and Chris Singleton hit a sacrifice fly to push the lead to 6-4 before Jeff Abbott walked to finish Kile.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 7, BREWERS 4: Joe Randa and Todd Dunwoody drove in two runs apiece, enabling Kansas City's Jeff Suppan to get his first victory since May 24 with a decision over visiting Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Suppan (3-6) was relieved by Ricky Bottalico after giving up a one-out double to Geoff Jenkins and a single to Jeromy Burnitz in the eighth.</p>
        <p>In seven and one-third innings, Suppan surrendered 4 runs on 10 hits. He retired Ron Belliard on a ground ball leading off the game and then struck out the next five batters.</p>
