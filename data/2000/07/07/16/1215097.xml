        <p>Alfredo Rodriguez and Roberto Rodriguez, New York</p>
        <p>Alfredo Rodriguez (left): I arrived here from Mexico in '92. My cousin Roberto came in '94. I didn't have any ideas about Asians. I didn't know any. But Mexican culture is very different than Asian, no? Our boss, Kim, is Korean. He's a good guy. He likes our work. And he only listens to Latin music now. In Mexico, the boss was never there. Latinos, Asians, every type of person comes in. A lot of people are surprised that there are Mexicans making sushi. The Asians say, ''How could you learn?'' But then they say, ''Good job.'' I've always known how to work hard; I certainly didn't learn that from Korean people. What I learned was how to make the food. And eat it too, I guess.</p>
        <p>Roberto Rodriguez (right): It was a Mexican guy who taught me to make sushi, at the Japanese restaurant where I worked before. In Mexico, I'd seen kung fu movies, but I didn't know any Asian people. Our families in Mexico think the restaurant is weird, that raw fish is weird. They'll eat it cooked, but I don't think they'll ever eat sushi.</p>
