        <p>Amazon.com Web site allows customers to review books and post their critiques; online critics are as apt to take crack at classics as best sellers; former librarian Harriet Klausner currently holds top spot as Amazon's most-prolific critic, with reviews of 545 titles; excerpts; photo (M)</p>

        <p>BOOK critics can be a pompous, self-important lot. Many people gripe that they are out of touch with the common reader and that their highfalutin academic tastes have no relation to what the masses might enjoy.</p>
        <p>As with every other aspect of modern life, the Internet -- specifically Amazon.com -- has leveled the literary playing field. The Web site's customers can review books and post their critiques, and thousands of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated them to the digital universe. (Amazon even ranks its most prolific critics, with the current No. 1 spot held by a former librarian, Harriet Klausner, who at last count had weighed in on 545 titles.)</p>

        <p>BOOK critics can be a pompous, self-important lot. Many people gripe that they are out of touch with the common reader and that their highfalutin academic tastes have no relation to what the masses might enjoy.</p>
        <p>As with every other aspect of modern life, the Internet -- specifically Amazon.com -- has leveled the literary playing field. The Web site's customers can review books and post their critiques, and thousands of them have tapped out their thoughts and donated them to the digital universe. (Amazon even ranks its most prolific critics, with the current No. 1 spot held by a former librarian, Harriet Klausner, who at last count had weighed in on 545 titles.)</p>
        <p>In addition to taking best-sellers and popular pulp to task, many of these unpaid arbiters of literary greatness feel it is their duty to take a crack at the classics.</p>
        <p>James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' is often hailed as the greatest novel of the 20th century, but many cybercritics are not so charitable:</p>
        <p>[''Ulysses'' is] a babbling, senseless tome upheld by ''literary luminaries'' who fear being cast into the tasteless bourgeois darkness for dissent. Joyce rambles and, moreover, Joyce doesn't say a blessed thing (save what literary critics assign him but that's what literary critics do: They find profundity -- not to mention the occasional phallic symbol -- in the midst of absolutely nothing.) The poor trees who gave their lives that Ulysses might gather dust on countless shelves would have been put to nobler use as toothpicks.</p>
        <p>Even the ''Odyssey'' has its detractors:</p>
        <p>There is no other word than awful. For school, we had to read this book, and I was kind of excited, I think Greek mythology is very interesting. I knew that it would be somewhat of a challenge, knowing it was poetry and since it was assigned in my Honors English class. Now that we are done with the book, I am forced to write a five-page paper on it. All that I can possibly say is that it bored me and I could not even finish it, because it was not written a way that you could understand it. I am warning you if you like to waste your time you should read this book, otherwise stay clear!</p>
        <p>Young people and students who have been forced to read the classics are among the most impassioned critics. Here's one take on ''War and Peace'':</p>
        <p>Im 11, thatas probably why i really dont like the book, but my point made is, my mom grounded me and made me read war and peace, and it was the worst punistment i have ever been through, i asked my family to read a page of it, and they all fell asleep, sorry to all the people who like it.</p>
        <p>On-line reviewers, like their professional brethren, can have wildly divergent points of view, as in these two entries on ''The Catcher in the Rye'':</p>
        <p>I love to read it. I love to just sit down and let this book take me on an adventure through the mind of one young man, Holden V. Caulfield, as he manages to reveal tremendous truths about, well, about just about everything. Congress should pass a law requiring everyone to read this book at least once and maybe twice. No joke.</p>
        <p>I entered into this book expecting the timeless classic everyone talks about. But . . . the writing is so-so, the story is a bore, the characters are dated and the twists are so overly perfect that it couldn't be real life. The connections Salinger makes throughout the story are so obvious and forced that it made me want to laugh, I could write better then this. A complete waste of an hour!</p>
        <p>Flashes of intellectual arrogance and snobbery come with the territory. Even ''Macbeth'' is not immune to the baleful gaze of one reviewer:</p>
        <p>Having researched great authors as part of my Ph.D. at Princeton, it is surprising how poorly Shakespeare has written this particular book. The plot is weak and lacks imagination, the character development is all over the shop and writing style is quite muddled in places. Interesting read though!</p>
        <p>Inevitably, some literati play it for laughs:</p>
        <p>While Nabokov's literary gymnastics are impressive, the overall experience of reading ''Lolita'' is an empty one. You're better off listening to the audio version (narrated by Liberace) or watching the Disney cartoon musical featuring the voices of Val Kilmer, Anna Paquin and Red Auerbach.</p>
        <p>No title is out of bounds for critical appraisal. Consider this rave for one classic (whose average grade on Amazon.com, by the way, is 4 1/2 out of 5 stars).</p>
        <p>What can I say about the Bible? The greatest book ever, it is more than a book. If you buy one book EVER, this is the one. Non-believers need to read this in any form. I don't want to spoil the end, but let's just say YOU NEED TO READ THIS BOOK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>
