        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed ''The Carnival's Coming to Town'' (cover, June 25) for the memories it stirred of traveling carnivals I attended while a little girl. In my neighborhood, the chief fund-raising event of the year for several Catholic schools was a spring carnival.</p>
        <p>In the school I attended, we would spy out the windows, during classes on frog dissecting and pre-algebra, to view the formation of giant Tilt-a-Whirls and cobra roller coasters and the setting up of colorful tents and games.</p>
        <p>Classes would conclude early one day and the carnival gates would open only to school students for a few magical hours. It was a financial gain to the school and a memory-making gain for the children.</p>
        <p>In our present-day society of insurance nightmares and legal liabilities,  none of the schools in our area use a carnival as a source of money-raising. As a teacher, if I were asked to release students to the thrills of a carnival playground, I would shudder and voice my hesitation. But as I remember the delights of those spring days, I can only wish for the carnival's return.</p>
