        <p>For those who like to complain about the weather, has anybody noticed anything unusual lately?</p>
        <p>The weather has been good!</p>
        <p>The month of June was pretty great, and the extended July 4th holiday weekend -- except for some showers on one of the days -- could not have been much better.</p>
        <p>For now, there has been enough rain to keep the lawns green, the crops flourishing and reservoir levels high. Yet there has not been too much rain to spoil weekends at the shore or around the barbecue pit.</p>
        <p>And temperatures have been relatively balmy for the most part, meaning lower air-conditioning bills.</p>
        <p>Just what's going on here? New Jersey was sweltering this time last year, heading into one of the worst droughts in years, followed by a hurricane that flooded parts of the state while -- in a mixed blessing -- refilling the reservoirs.</p>
        <p>''You can't compare last year to most other years,'' said David Robinson of Rutgers University, who is the state climatologist. ''When all was said and done, the period from April to July was the second-driest such period on record back to 1895.''</p>
        <p>But precipitation in the state as a whole since April 1 has been normal, and temperatures have been only slightly above normal.</p>
        <p>Precipitation in June ranged from a low of 2.7 inches in Monmouth County to a high of 6.4 inches in Sussex County. Many parts of the state, from Bergen to Southwest Jersey, have experienced only 8 to 10 days of 90-degree temperatures or more since May 1, he said. The coast and northwestern part of the state have had only one to three days of 90-plus temperatures.</p>
        <p>''June was rainy, depending on where you were in the state,'' Dr. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Passaic, Sussex and Warren were 1 1/2 to 2 inches above normal; Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Ocean were up to 2 inches above normal. Other counties ranged from eight-tenths of an inch to an inch above normal.</p>
        <p>''That's good news,''' said Dr. Robinson, ''That means all of the state had relatively ample rain.''</p>
        <p>The rain and moderate temperatures have been especially good news for farmers, said Stephen Garrison, a specialist in vegetable crops with Rutgers Cooperative Extension in Bridgeton.</p>
        <p>''Rainfall distribution has been good,'' Dr. Garrison said. ''Growers have not had to irrigate, except in certain areas.'' He added, ''We haven't had that many days in the 90's, so generally conditions have been good for growth.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Ort Jr. of Ort Family Farms in Long Valley, Morris County, said crops have been growing faster and more abundantly than in 1999.</p>
        <p>''Last year we were starting to be in a drought,'' Mr. Ort said. ''I was irrigating a lot this time last year. Now the corn looks to be a bumper crop, and, if we get a few more rains, the pumpkins will do well. All the small vegerables are looking good.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey's four major water systems are at about 96 percent of capacity, about 8 percent above normal, said Loretta O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>And tourism, which brought the state $27.7 billion in revenue last year, is booming, said the state's director of tourism, Noreen Bodman, in part because of the weather.</p>
        <p>''Obviously when you have such beautiful weather as we've been having this past month, it bodes well for everyone in the tourism industry, whether people are spending time at the Jersey Shore, hiking through the Pinelands or canoeing along the Delaware River, said Ms. Bodman. ''It's just been perfect weather.''</p>
