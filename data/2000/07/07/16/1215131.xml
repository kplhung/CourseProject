        <p>INSINUATING its way into a summer of movies of negligible ambiguity -- many are the attractions of ''Gladiator,''  ''The Patriot'' and ''The Perfect Storm,'' but their ability to provoke a tentative, questioning mood in the viewer is not among them -- comes one of the major chew bones of this year's Sundance Film Festival, ''Chuck and Buck.'' The movie, which opened on Friday, is about boyhood friends who re-encounter each other after many years; Chuck has gone on to become a Los Angeles record company executive, professionally accomplished and successfully affianced, while Buck hasn't gone on to anything except a huge case of arrested development, a large part of which involves keeping the memory of their boyish sex play burning like an eternal flame. It's a movie that careers into one cringe-inducing circumstance after another: the sexuality of children, the old relationship that will not die, the overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the panicked, the geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy!</p>
        <p>Written by Michael White, it also stars Michael White. ''What people create is a fulfillment of a wish that we are conscious of or unconscious of,'' said the Freudian Mr. White. ''I see this in other people's movies, and sometimes you wonder whether moviemaking is anything more than that. It's like all they want to do is see Sharon Stone uncross her legs, and the whole movie is built around that moment.'' Audiences will note that Mr. White did not take the competent, has-his-act-together Chuck part, but the goofy, pathetic, disruptive Buck part. ''Chuck and Buck'' is, of course, fiction -- of course it's fiction -- but it's hard to think of anyone in recent years who's made as riskily revelatory an artistic statement as Michael White.</p>

        <p>INSINUATING its way into a summer of movies of negligible ambiguity -- many are the attractions of ''Gladiator,''  ''The Patriot'' and ''The Perfect Storm,'' but their ability to provoke a tentative, questioning mood in the viewer is not among them -- comes one of the major chew bones of this year's Sundance Film Festival, ''Chuck and Buck.'' The movie, which opened on Friday, is about boyhood friends who re-encounter each other after many years; Chuck has gone on to become a Los Angeles record company executive, professionally accomplished and successfully affianced, while Buck hasn't gone on to anything except a huge case of arrested development, a large part of which involves keeping the memory of their boyish sex play burning like an eternal flame. It's a movie that careers into one cringe-inducing circumstance after another: the sexuality of children, the old relationship that will not die, the overweening confidence of jerks, the cruelty of the panicked, the geek who will not go away. And it's a comedy!</p>
        <p>Written by Michael White, it also stars Michael White. ''What people create is a fulfillment of a wish that we are conscious of or unconscious of,'' said the Freudian Mr. White. ''I see this in other people's movies, and sometimes you wonder whether moviemaking is anything more than that. It's like all they want to do is see Sharon Stone uncross her legs, and the whole movie is built around that moment.'' Audiences will note that Mr. White did not take the competent, has-his-act-together Chuck part, but the goofy, pathetic, disruptive Buck part. ''Chuck and Buck'' is, of course, fiction -- of course it's fiction -- but it's hard to think of anyone in recent years who's made as riskily revelatory an artistic statement as Michael White.</p>
        <p>''I'd always felt sort of oppressed by images of perfection,'' said Mr. White, 29, who features within his credit-packed writing career two seasons on the perfect-teen television series ''Dawson's Creek.''  ''Perfect people living perfect lives, the Aaron Spelling version of things that just infiltrates Hollywood generally. And so when I see people on TV or in the movies who are more misfits, I feel that's sort of healing, to see that there are people like you out there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White traces his empathy to his upbringing. He was raised in northern California in a religious household. His father, Melvin White, is a clergyman who was the ghostwriter of books for Jerry Falwell, Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Pat Robertson and Billy Graham. The Whites went to a fundamentalist summer camp, where in the mornings campers would lift their arms in the air and practice the rapture they'd feel at the Second Coming -- fundamentalist calisthenics. Several years ago, after he had finished putting his two children through college, the elder Mr. White came out of the closet and became a gay activist, critical of the religious right for its intolerance toward gays. He had, however, come out to his family a decade before. ''My dad ended up having to stay closeted and my parents had to pretend they were still married'' -- they are now divorced -- ''and he had to keep taking these jobs to basically keep me in school. It was a very tortured extended experience for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White's father recalled that Michael went his own way, even as a child. ''Mike is a kid who refuses to do what's anticipated,'' Melvin White said. ''He refuses to play with the common paradigms. I remember him saying to me, 'You're not gay, that's just a construct that limits you.' That's when he was 16.''</p>
        <p>Michael White, who is tall and thin, with a reedy voice, hair like strawberry blond grass and eyeballs drawn by Dr. Seuss, said the idea for ''Chuck and Buck'' came to him after several years of living a writerly existence in Hollywood and feeling frustrated both socially and creatively. ''The social side,'' he said over dinner in Manhattan late last month, ''was always about putting your best face forward, meeting people, getting work, being in the mix, being liked. Creatively, there was the frustration of going through the development process in both TV and the movies. 'Dawson's Creek' was such a show about people who were beautiful and articulate. And so much of development is about: 'How do you make this character more likable? How are you going to fall in love with them quicker in the movie?' 'Chuck and Buck' is about a reaction to that destructive way of creating a script. I thought, 'I'm going to create a character who has all the characteristics of what you hope you aren't.' '' He set up an alter ego struggle: Chuck is the handsome, successful character you project to the world, and Buck is the character who's confused and a nuisance and has nothing to offer. ''And I really wanted to tap into the Buck side,'' Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>What obviously gives the movie its tension, both comic and dramatic, is Chuck and Buck's old sexual relationship, something Chuck wants to hide as much as Buck wants to revive. As his father would say, Mr. White has refused to play with common paradigms. ''There's been a lot of hi-jinxy mainstream Hollywood comedies, like 'What About Bob?' or 'The Cable Guy,' '' Mr. White said, ''where the undercurrent of homoeroticism is a central part of where the comedy comes from. I wanted to push the envelope. And there's also the mainstream version of the character with arrested development, a Rain Man or a Forrest Gump, a character who's a touchstone through which people access the child in themselves. But these characters are idealized. I was thinking, all people have sexuality. There was a kid in my neighborhood who had Down syndrome, and everyone went out of their way to be inclusive and to be sensitive to his needs. But the minute he would grab my sister or fondle her inappropriately, immediately all the good intentions would cave in. And to me, it was kind of comical.''</p>
        <p>THE resultant screenplay -- about characters you like, feel for, dislike and are dismayed and repelled by, pretty much all at once -- was, in Mr. White's word, polarizing.</p>
        <p>''People not only told me they wouldn't finance it,'' he said, ''but their reactions were hostile. They were, like: 'Why are you doing this? Why do you want to make this? But a lot of people loved the script.'' One of them was Miguel Arteta, the director of the critically acclaimed indie ''Star Maps'' (1997). ''Movies about obsessed people usually end in bloodbath,'' Mr. Arteta said. ''Mike shows that Buck is just a character with a big hole in his heart that he's trying to fill.'' Mr. Arteta quickly agreed to direct the screenplay and took the project to Open Cities, a New York-based production company that wants to foster artistic freedom, and it underwrote filming.</p>
        <p>Then came casting. Mr. White, who acted at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and has had tiny parts in films and on television, seems to enjoy performing, especially in scenarios of his own invention. His father said: ''Mike gave me and my partner his Toyota 4Runner so we could make trips to the Home Depot, and he bought himself a Lincoln Town Car, with the dark windows and everything, and a chauffeur's hat. And he wears the hat when he drives himself around. 'Dad,' he says, 'It feels like I'm always going to the airport.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. White had harbored a desire to play Buck even as he was writing: ''It felt like it would be a challenge to play Buck, a way of engaging with the material in a more intensely creative way. And because the movie is about alter egos inside you that you're afraid to show, I thought it would be very gutsy for me to just go for it.'' And besides, he added, ''I really never thought anyone would see the movie.''</p>
        <p>He can no longer remember whether it was he or Mr. Arteta who actually floated the idea first, but he was cast promptly, particularly after Mr. Arteta cast the Weitz brothers, Chris and Paul, the makers of ''American Pie.'' Chris plays Chuck, and Paul -- pay attention now -- portrays an actor who is playing a character in a play who is based on Chuck. ''It was an amazing, funny, fluent, confident script that didn't succumb to any of the usual cliches,'' Chris Weitz said. ''But to be truthful, I told Miguel I'd do the part even before I read it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White's performance, Mr. Arteta said, turned out to be compelling: ''Emotionally, he's telling you exactly what's going on at all times. You know, he had to cry a lot in that movie, and whether it was a tight shot or a wide shot, he went for it every time. Then he went home depleted.''</p>
        <p>Being the front man for this movie has been strange, Mr. White said: ''It did seem like it was generating a lot of discussion at Sundance. After spending years on stuff that was palatable and easy to digest, I felt this is finally what I intended. People were talking about sexuality, about relationships, taking different sides. That's the most exciting part of writing, when the story lingers beyond the telling of it in discussion and debate.''</p>
        <p>SINCE the debut of ''Chuck and Buck,'' Mr. White has been sent screenplays with parts earmarked for him. ''Much like you'd expect,'' he said, ''dumb bananas and computer whizzes.'' He said he was interested in acting again -- ''I should take a part in an action movie, just so when people see my performance in 'Chuck and Buck,' they'll say, 'Oh, he's acting.' '' Right now, however, he is focused on writing. He's at work on two pilots and two screenplays for the producer Scott Rudin, and is hopeful that financing will come through for another screenplay he has done for Mr. Arteta, which he describes as '' 'Madame Bovary' meets 'Raising Arizona.' ''</p>
        <p>And he's still jazzed about ''Chuck and Buck'': ''If I had just written it, I would feel proud. But because I'm in it, it's just weird for me. Because now people have reactions not only to the movie but to me, personally. A lot of people really want to engage. A lot of them want to, like, tell you their own story, and I don't really want to be the receptacle for all the insanity this movie may provoke. And clearly I'm also leaving myself open to a lot of speculation and discussion. I was in a restaurant the other day, and someone came up to me and said, 'I saw your movie, and I have just one question -- is it autobiographical?' And I thought, 'Be careful what you wish for.'</p>
        <p>''But it's been so interesting to create an alter ego of yourself, one that's what you're most afraid of showing to the world, and to do it on such a big scale. In L.A., people put their best face forward and get accepted, but how meaningful is that? But if you put your most twisted and vulnerable side forward and people accept or don't accept it, it just feels more intense.</p>
        <p>''This is a meaningful experience. It feels so naked.''</p>
