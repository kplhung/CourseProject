        <p>ON a breezy Saturday afternoon, Rawle George rode his bike into Prospect Park, weaved around the families barbecuing hot dogs, and coasted past a crowded Little League game. Stopping in a field of people flying kites and playing Frisbee, he scanned the scene until his eye hooked onto one object: a white ball being kicked into the air.</p>
        <p>Mr. George pedaled over to an archipelago of backpacks and leaned down his bike. A few faces in the soccer game were familiar, but he couldn't tell who was on which team or where the boundaries might be.</p>
        <p>In fact, the game he plays has no real boundaries. Bags and coats serve as goal posts. There are no starting or ending times, no corner kicks, no referees or uniforms. Most players don't know the score or even the names of all the teammates they pass to.</p>
        <p>''You call them by their country,'' Mr. George explained as he laced up his cleats. The skinny one with the curly black hair and the graceful rainbow kick is Morocco. India, tall with huge quadriceps, is known for his bright red shorts and powerful shots. Wiry, energetic England streaks up to head the ball into the goal, while Brazil, compact with a dapper mustache, dribbles through a minefield of defenders.</p>
        <p>''Back home you play with people you know,'' said Mr. George, 38, a computer engineer who moved to the United States from Guyana 19 years ago. ''Here you have absolutely no idea who you're playing with. You'll play for months with somebody, you'll come here and talk about soccer events going on in the world, and then at the end you'll say, 'See you tomorrow.' You don't ask their number or anything.''</p>
        <p>For strangers seeking to orient themselves in Brooklyn, the Long Meadow section of Prospect Park is not the best place. A vast sky, banished years ago from Manhattan, stretches across a tree-lined bowl of grass between the band shell and the duck pond. Block out the top of an apartment building at one far end, and there's nothing to show you're in a big city, let alone what neighborhood you're in.</p>
        <p>Which is appropriate, since the park is a hub for many neighborhoods. From the brownstones of Park Slope to the row houses  of Flatbush and Crown Heights, residents of Brooklyn and elsewhere converge for picnics, concerts, weddings and pick-up soccer.</p>
        <p>While soccer is played in parks across the city, games tend to be dominated by one ethnic group, players say, adding that Central Park games, while mixed, are more competitive than in Prospect Park.</p>
        <p>In Prospect Park, no one group dominates. There are no designated soccer fields, except at the Parade Grounds south of Fort Hamilton Parkway, and no estimates of how many people play. But anyone who wants to can usually get into the games that sprout up daily and especially on weekends in the  grassy valley. Starting times are dictated by the season: games begin a few hours before sunset and end at dusk.</p>
        <p>Despite their casual appearance, the games have persisted for decades, outlasting many other rituals that have faded in and out. Whether it's 60 people playing multiple games on a lush summer lawn or six fleece-clad die-hards on an ice-crusted field, they come for exercise and a camaraderie that many say cannot be found elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''It's an interaction,'' said Andreas Cohrssen, a German doctor who has played most Sundays of his 14 years living in Brooklyn. ''It's like a circle of friends who are working on a common goal and supporting each other, even if you don't know them.''</p>
        <p>Omar Raji, known as Morocco, agreed.</p>
        <p>''That round ball over there connects everybody,'' he said. ''People don't even speak the same language sometimes, but they communicate.''</p>
        <p>WITH tousled gray hair and a wild-looking beard, Shawn Gargagliano looks like Robinson Crusoe in athletic shorts, an urban explorer who has found utopia on the soccer field.</p>
        <p>''You imagine this ideal society where class, race and ethnic differences exist but they don't matter,'' said Mr. Gargagliano, a carpenter and sculptor reared in Englewood, N.J. ''There's very few places where it's actually like that, and I think when we're playing soccer that's one of the few places where that actually does happen.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't always this way. In 1976, when Mr. Gargagliano first started playing in Prospect Park, being American was a disadvantage for getting into the mostly Latin American games, he recalled.</p>
        <p>Barriers eroded as Americans picked up the sport and a diverse group of immigrants arrived. But even a decade ago, games could be hard to find.</p>
        <p>''There were times when you had to look hard to realize it's a round ball and not a football,'' said Aziz Chaqor, who started coming in 1992. Pondering the change, he added, ''I think the World Cup in '94 helped.'' The United States was host to the World Cup that year.</p>
        <p>Age varies widely, from teenagers to grandfathers, as does expertise. People who have never kicked a ball play alongside people who played on their national teams. Some novices leave after a season. Others become addicted -- to the give of the grass beneath their feet, to the steadying arm of a teammate after a fall, to the satisfaction when a perfectly timed touch reverses  the ball's course, leaving an opponent running empty.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, the park game changes lives. When Toure Carpette, 27, visited from Trinidad four years ago and played in the park, a man on the field introduced himself as a scout. Mr. Carpette now attends St. Francis College in Brooklyn Heights on a soccer scholarship.</p>
        <p>More often, though, off-field lives have nothing to do with soccer. If the game is a mini-United Nations, its players represent enough occupations to start a small town. A Canadian jazz musician, a Polish biologist who drives a truck, an Indian social worker, an American magazine illustrator, a Berber Algerian architect and an English floor sander all play here. In Manhattan on a Saturday night, some have been surprised to recognize the bartender at the Royalton Hotel in Midtown or the singer at a Lower East Side klezmer concert. During the week, men in suits squint at one another in Manhattan, trying to place the person they saw in cleats and a muddy T-shirt the day before.</p>
        <p>''I played with Andreas for years before I knew he was a doctor,'' said Mr. Gargagliano, whose two teenage sons often play alongside him. ''There was a guy, I think he used to be on the Greek national team, who owned a luncheonette. I used to bring my kids there on their birthday. And I used to play with a guy who was a Tupamaro,'' a  guerrilla from Uruguay. ''All these people have another life somewhere.''</p>
        <p>EVEN as nationalities blend together on the field, cultural variations are not lost. Last December, during Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, tempers were short as the afternoon waned; the minute the sun disappeared, several players whipped out bottles of fruit juice, their first nourishment of the day.</p>
        <p>National origin also affects playing style, dictating who keeps the ball close, who plays it wide, who talks a lot while playing. ''The way you play in Brazil you couldn't possibly play in England,'' Mr. Gargagliano said, ''because how could you dribble like that when the ball is wet?''</p>
        <p>Eugene Chen, a tall Trinidadian, said, ''It's always easier to play amongst your own, easy to slip into that.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''Eventually you have to find a middle ground.''</p>
        <p>Political differences, too, must be set aside. Frenchmen play with North Africans,  Arabs with Israelis. ''All those differences are minor,'' Mr. Gargagliano said, ''compared to whether you hold the ball too long, or never pass it, or know how to run when you don't have the ball.''</p>
        <p>Asked about race, Mr. George, who is black, said the game broadens perspectives.</p>
        <p>''I do feel that a lot of black players who play here, because of where they live, they don't see a lot of white people,'' he said. ''They have a certain impression of what white people are like. And for white people it's the same thing. Each group may think the other group is stuck up and only wants to play with themselves.''</p>
        <p>Players often get along better with others than with their own kind, he said.</p>
        <p>''Nine out of 10 of the fights I've seen here have been between the same race,'' he said. ''I've seen two Muslim guys, I've seen two white guys, I've seen two black guys, and I've seen two Spanish guys. I get the feeling people tend to respect people from different cultures. The other day we had Arabs and four Orthodox Jewish guys. They played like normal. They tackle each other, get up and laugh about it, and run away.''</p>
        <p>While many on-field bonds remain anonymous, some blossom into friendships as players repair to cafes for postgame snacks and conversation. For many, soccer provides that often-elusive phenomenon: a regular social gathering, which churches or bowling leagues once offered.</p>
        <p>''Given New York the way it is, once a week is a lot,'' said Tom Vanderbilt, a writer from Illinois who has played in the park for five years. ''It's more than I see other friends. It's easier to play soccer than to make dinner.''</p>
        <p>Many cite a respite from the urban canyons, an escape into a pastoral world where watches and cell phones can be tucked away. For others, especially new immigrants, the game is a familiar milieu in an inscrutable city.</p>
        <p>''It reminds me of my childhood,'' said Hatem Ben Mansour, a Tunisian.</p>
        <p>Dina Levy, an American player who has lived in Ecuador, said: ''The thing about soccer in third world countries is you don't need anything. You can make the goal out of two pieces of trash. I have a friend who's Bolivian who used to take his mother's nylons and make a ball. You don't need equipment, you don't need a diamond for it, you don't need hoops for it even. You can play on all kinds of surfaces: dirt, grass, pavement.''</p>
        <p>And they do, all over the world. The only country where a soccer chip does not seem to have been implanted in all infant boys is the United States. Like pasta or borscht, the game was brought over by newcomers.</p>
        <p>''It's like a part of them, in the way baseball is here,'' Mr. Gargagliano said. ''It's something that exists that American culture, power and the government has no control over, doesn't really know about. It's one of those places where being part of the dominant culture doesn't buy you anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chaqor, who moved to the United States in 1985 from Morocco (where he played soccer ''between traffic, you know''),  sees a role for immigrants as soccer diplomats.</p>
        <p>''In the back of everyone's mind is, 'We have to develop soccer in the U.S.,' '' he said. ''So we always try to make it nice for non-soccer players. If a native American comes in and you can tell that the person has never touched the ball before, you always let him play.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chaqor, a computer analyst, grinned as he held a ball for his 2-year-old American-born son to kick. ''It's like an uncovered beauty,'' he said. ''You want to share it with the local people.''</p>
        <p>Over time, many find that their years in the park game date back longer than jobs or spouses. The game can even dictate home lives, with some players planning business and vacation itineraries around it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vanderbilt said his girlfriend's parents know not to schedule family functions on Sunday afternoons, when he plays. The game also factored into the couple's house hunting. ''She wanted to look in Manhattan, but I was thinking about how was I going to get to soccer on Sundays,'' he said. Luckily for him, Manhattan proved too expensive and the couple moved to Carroll Gardens.</p>
        <p>On mild days, girlfriends and wives sometimes watch. But a smattering of women also play. They are not called by their country; most are from the United States, where girls growing up have more opportunities for soccer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levy, 28, a law student, started playing here two years ago. An outgoing, athletic blonde who was on her high school team, Ms. Levy said walking up to an all-male game was a little intimidating at first.</p>
        <p>''It used to be I'd get out on the field and nobody said hi,'' she said. Now, though, ''you go and you give people hugs, kiss people on the cheeks.'' Once the players got to know her, a tone was set, she said, adding, ''New guys who come out here see the way people pass to me.''</p>
        <p>A few balk. One player mentioned a devout Muslim man who walked off the field when a woman joined the game.</p>
        <p>''He told me he wouldn't play if she was there,'' the player recalled. ''I said: 'Listen, she's not here to flirt with you, she's not here to have sex with you, she's not here to marry you. She's here to play soccer.' '' Eventually, the man resumed playing.</p>
        <p>But most male players say they don't mind women on the field.</p>
        <p>''I think it's cool,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Some guys don't want you to beat them in front of a girl, or don't want to be beaten by a girl. But they're just other players, more or less.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Levy said she has never felt unwelcome, despite occasional slips of the tongue.</p>
        <p>''I did hear one person make a comment like, 'Oh, come on, this is second-rate soccer; this is like women,' but I didn't get offended.''</p>
        <p>''It seems like they make an effort to pass to me, to be encouraging,'' she said. ''Sometimes they're even more friendly to me than to other guys.''</p>
        <p>Others have had a harder time. Lisa Barnable, 31, a film editor, had never played soccer when she came upon a game three years ago and thought it would be fun.</p>
        <p>Initially, she said, she felt resented, especially by those who were not regulars. ''On the field,'' she said, ''they'd bump me, saying, 'If you can't take it, you have to leave.' ''</p>
        <p>Eventually, though, Ms. Barnable made friends. She now sees the game as a haven from her daily life. And although she encounters the stereotype of ''someone always assuming you're someone's girlfriend,'' she said the possibility of dating a fellow player is unlikely. ''I'd have to really, really like the person to lose my escape from reality,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nor did Ms. Levy ever consider seeking romance on the field.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys out there want me to feel comfortable,'' she said. ''They like the fact that I'm out there because it's more diverse for them, too. So I think they're even more reserved.''</p>
        <p>But last fall she started walking home with a Honduran who lived near her. Things had first clicked for them on the field.</p>
        <p>''We'd look out for each other,'' Ms. Levy recalled. ''When he'd go off the field, I'd notice. And I think he noticed me.'' They began dating and have been together eight months.</p>
        <p>''When you're playing like that on a team together, it definitely creates a sense of connection,'' she said. ''I remember the first time he passed me the ball. He had this big smile, and it was one of those moments that made me happy to have soccer.''</p>
        <p>BUT even this field is not always idyllic. With no referees to call fouls, fights can break out, although they are usually halted by other players.</p>
        <p>A few complain of a lack of structure. On  summer days the game can grow to an unmanageable size, often breaking into smaller games. One player spoke of trying to organize teams, with referees and scheduled matches. But while some do play on  teams around the city, most said the park game's fluidity is part of its appeal.</p>
        <p>''This is like mellow kicks for me,'' Mr. Carpette said. ''You never hear all this laughter in practice.''</p>
        <p>Most agreed that organized games would promote exclusivity, cutting out less skilled players or those with erratic schedules.</p>
        <p>Alex Kranjec, a psychology student who has played for Brooklyn College and will be its assistant coach next year, lamented the way organized youth soccer has developed in the United States. Rather than being a natural part of children's play, the game is too often dominated, he said, by ''rich suburban families who send their kids to camps so they can get close to the coaches and get picked for select teams.''</p>
        <p>That is why Mr. Kranjec likes Prospect Park, where games drift into one another with no beginning or end, where the only goal is the one between gym bags. ''It's like surfing, in a way, or what I imagine surfing would be like,'' he said. ''Hanging out at the beach, waiting for the waves. A dumb thing I could do indefinitely.''</p>
        <p>And while the ebbs and flows mean a game can expand into ungainliness or peter out suddenly, at times the pattern of players hits a synchronicity like that of close siblings.</p>
        <p>Then, the game becomes magical. It can happen on a frozen field when the air is so cold it stabs the lungs, or on a spring afternoon when the melodic wail of a nearby reggae concert floats over a player's dance around the ball. Or on a summer evening when, after a warm rain, fireflies flicker under trees, the scent of grass rises up and wet clouds part over an oil-painted sunset.</p>
        <p>Muscles tingle. Tired feet fumble the passes. The field slowly darkens until it's just silhouettes racing in the night.</p>
        <p>''Last goal wins?'' a voice calls out.</p>
        <p>But it's a perfect five-on-five, the ball is still in play, and no one wants to go home.</p>
