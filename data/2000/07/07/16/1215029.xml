        <p>The Sleep-Over Artist</p>
        <p>By Thomas Beller.</p>
        <p>296 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $23.95.</p>
        <p>LIKE Alex Fader, his hapless, acerbic, Holden Caulfieldesque protagonist, Thomas Beller is a bit of a trickster. Alex is forever approaching life in a sidelong manner, dodging weightiness, slipping away from commitment and complication. Beller constructs his stories in a similar manner: establish, circle, deflect, half-resolve. In ''The Sleep-Over Artist,'' Beller's follow-up to his first collection, ''Seduction Theory,'' it initially seems we're doomed to spend 296 pages with a callow, horny narcissist. This prospect may be especially discouraging to heterosexual female readers with a certain amount of dating experience, who have quite likely had it up to here with alluringly confused poet boy types. But Beller's deft sleight of hand is to convince you of Alex's overwhelming self-centeredness early on, only to shake things up later as his boy comes of age and sees with far greater clarity how life revolves beyond his limited purview.</p>
        <p>Less a novel than an interconnected set of stories that follow Alex roughly chronologically from the age of 6 into his mid-20's, ''The Sleep-Over Artist'' is bumpy going in its first sections. The fragment of an opener, ''Falling Water,'' involves young Alex's habit of throwing water out the window of various Upper West Side high-rises and gleefully watching the results far below. It's slight, the ending forced. This story and the one that follows, ''Natural Selection,'' also feature the fatal flaw of putting improbably elevated thoughts into the minds of children. A 6-year-old Alex, leaning halfway out the bathroom window like Superman (one wonders where Alex's bright parents have hidden the window guards), finds himself ''contemplating what it would be like to take the plunge and if his life so far had contained enough satisfaction so that it could now reasonably come to a close.'' When Alex is a bit older, the boy who can scarcely lift a huge bouquet of roses for his mother at the end of her dance performance is reported to feel ''appalled that so much effort should be in service to such a fleeting thing.'' Not only does the thought condescend to his mother, but it poses a philosophical wisdom as unlikely as it is irritating.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Beller needs for Alex to grow up so their respective voices can merge, and his footing grows more steady as Alex undergoes the death of his father and then becomes a teenager, attending bar mitzvahs and watching Ugly George on TV, praying that the notorious cameraman/stalker will persuade some woman on the street to pull up her shirt and provide a queasy-making thrill. Alex finds himself wandering the city alone, freed from the constraints of childhood. This giddy liberation is explored with real charm in ''The Harmonie Club,'' where Alex learns that an assured nod can buy entry into the elite lairs of adult maledom, even if the rules for operating there are unclear once you step inside.</p>
        <p>Soon Alex is buying pot on Bleecker Street, hanging in bars on Avenue A and entering ''the twisted force field of girls.'' It is on the last subject that Beller is particularly skilled; he captures perfectly the myriad stages of fear, discovery and elation that mark one's first sexual experiences, with a heavy emphasis on breasts and their unique effect on the nascent male libido.</p>
        <p>''The Sleep-Over Artist'' truly hits its stride in the extended comical story ''Vas Is Dat?'' Alex, who's floating through his fuzzy postcollegiate years and beginning to hone his skill at crashing in girlfriends' apartments (hence the title), hooks up with his mercenary cousin Karl in a scheme to manage their Alzheimer's-afflicted Aunti B's surprisingly large stash of savings.</p>
        <p>The story begins and ends with scenes of Aunti B leaving her apartment of many years to go to a nursing home in a white stretch limo that Karl has ordered, but is most compelling in the creepy-funny central scene, where Alex backs Aunti B's cleaning woman and caretaker, Esmeralda, into a bathroom and has a vivid sexual encounter that trades equally in titillation and humiliation. Esmeralda is the first of two large-breasted Hispanic women on whom Alex fixates in ''The Sleep-Over Artist''; one would have been plenty. But that doesn't detract from the hilarious power play Esmeralda enacts on the ever-insecure Alex.</p>
        <p>As he becomes more entangled in relationships around the age of 25 (and is said to be, somewhat unconvincingly, a documentary filmmaker), Alex begins to evolve, and the stories do, too. In ''Say It With Furs'' and ''Personal Style,'' we get into the heads of the women Alex meets, their voices trading perspectives with Alex's in a kind of he-said-she-said interplay. ''Caller ID'' shifts viewpoints mid-narrative, exploring from both sides what happens when Alex's current girlfriend, Melissa, lies to him about a phone call from a manipulative lover who disconcertingly resembles a certain erudite talk show host.</p>
        <p>BY ''Seconds of Pleasure,'' a protracted story even more nuanced than the more farcical ''Vas Is Dat?,'' Alex has involved himself with Katrina, a divorced mother in London, and Beller paints a hauntingly accurate portrait of a love affair laced with grown-up complications. Although Alex still reads most situations through his own scrim of lust and insecurity, he is also forced to consider the disappointment and pain of others. The story moves the lovers through teasing aggression and feigned indifference into a layered blend of desire and nurture. While the presence of Katrina's 6-year-old son brings up some overly blunt connections to Alex's childhood, this also permits a welcome revision of opinions of Alex formed earlier in ''The Sleep-Over Artist.'' Where the young Alex of the story ''Stay'' recalled without much regret that he once forbade his mother to date after the death of his father, the more adult Alex wonders in ''Seconds of Pleasure'' how he could have been such a myopic jerk. He didn't see the injustice at 10, had an idea it might be unfair at 15 and realizes he was borderline cruel as he moves into his late 20's. This is, honestly speaking, progress.</p>
        <p>And yet it's no surprise that this portrait of the sleep-over artist as a gradually enlightened young man finally deposits its hero back on the Upper West Side, where he began. In the concluding story, ''New Windows,'' Alex Fader, the boy who's roamed from bed to bed seeking comfort at any number of bosoms, returns home to mama. When Beller gives her the wry last word, you know that he knows just how much growing up Alex still has to do.</p>
