        <p>Cunningham: I don't remember when Nam and I met, but I remember in the early 60's Nam June, in the course of a piece, cut off John Cage's tie [laughs]. It was wonderful. The piece went on for quite a while, and then Nam June disappeared. And we all sat and waited, and some time later, he telephoned from someplace outside to tell us the piece was over.</p>
        <p>Paik: It was kind of stupid avant-garde [laughs]. Back then, I was a groupie, so I went to Venice to see Merce Cunningham dance in John Cage's so-called avant-garde festival. We had our first big collaboration in 1965.</p>

        <p>Cunningham: I think I finally asked, ''Is he from Korea.'' And I was told, ''Yes.'' And that was settled.</p>
        <p>Paik: We were just wondering how to be new. We were kind of lucky, middle-class people, and race was not so important. I know he's very much taller than me [laughs], but back then, Merce Cunningham had a very good black dancer and also a very good white prima donna, so it was a very, very integrated party even then.</p>
        <p>Cunningham: I was interested in dancers, in having dancers who could dance, not in what race they were.</p>
        <p>Paik: I remember in 1977, when I was working at Channel 13 as a kind of research department, there were some black militant people, and they often would ask, ''Is your office integrated?'' And they opened the door, and they saw me, and they would leave [laughs]. So I integrated the group.</p>
