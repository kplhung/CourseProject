      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Ron B. and Kathy C., New York State Supreme Court, Manhattan</p>
        <p>Ron B. (center): I was born and raised in Louisiana. New York is not like cities in the South; it's as close as you can get to Europe, where there are so many different races that prejudice is cut in half. I've been here three years now and I don't see racism hardly at all.</p>
        <p>The defendant in our case was a minority, and the minorities on the jury were pretty outspoken from the beginning about his guilt, for armed robbery. I said to myself, ''Wow, everybody here really is colorblind.'' I had been sort of thinking, Could it be that maybe they might see it a different way than I do because they've been around crime more than I have and it's one of their own, and just on that, that they might try to acquit the person?</p>
        <p>Maybe some of that is from the O.J. Simpson trial. But I didn't see that. Most of the minorities had him guilty from the beginning of deliberations; if he had any sympathy with our jury, it was probably from two or three Caucasians. So I didn't see anything prejudiced in this case. I'm glad it wasn't an all-white jury. If it had been all white, I may have just found the guy not guilty initially, just so we could talk about it.</p>
        <p>Kathy C. (third from right): I watch a ton of Court TV, so there's part of me that expected it to be just like what I saw on TV. But it's just a long, slow process. I didn't feel like I was representing black women from Manhattan or whatever. I just felt like I was going there as me, with my opinions and my judgments. With white people, I think there's a certain amount of political correctness, where it's like race really doesn't matter, it's not a thing you discuss. But I think if it had been an all-black jury, people would have said, ''What's wrong with this brother?'' That sort of thing. In a mixed group, race is much less likely to be discussed. I felt like this guy should be found guilty and I felt he should go to jail for a good little while. I was very nervous. I think everybody was nervous. I was sitting there talking to a woman who produces her own television show and another guy who's a stockbroker and somebody else who worked in the financial industry like I do. There's a part of me that thinks of certain jobs as jobs that belong to rich white girls where their daddies can afford to support them, so I was surprised that I also had something in common with, like, the trustfund kids. But I thought it was a really good process. I even wound up exchanging phone numbers with some people.</p>
