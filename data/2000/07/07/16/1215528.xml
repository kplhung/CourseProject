        <p>The 57th New York Handicap was complicated by an unexpected handicap: a soft turf course made somewhat marshy from yesterday's rains, which caused 22 horses to be scratched from earlier races at Belmont Park. But Perfect Sting found a way to overcome: she bided her time until the homestretch, delivered a powerful dash that nabbed Snow Polina in the final strides, and then won the handicap by a head.</p>
        <p>It was the third victory in a row for Perfect Sting, the best older grass filly in the East, and it kept her aimed directly at a Breeders' Cup championship in November. She has won all three of her races this year and 8 of her last 10. She is 5 for 5 at Belmont in her career, which now shows 11 trips to the winner's circle in 16 starts.</p>

        <p>The 57th New York Handicap was complicated by an unexpected handicap: a soft turf course made somewhat marshy from yesterday's rains, which caused 22 horses to be scratched from earlier races at Belmont Park. But Perfect Sting found a way to overcome: she bided her time until the homestretch, delivered a powerful dash that nabbed Snow Polina in the final strides, and then won the handicap by a head.</p>
        <p>It was the third victory in a row for Perfect Sting, the best older grass filly in the East, and it kept her aimed directly at a Breeders' Cup championship in November. She has won all three of her races this year and 8 of her last 10. She is 5 for 5 at Belmont in her career, which now shows 11 trips to the winner's circle in 16 starts.</p>
        <p>''The real ones always find a way to win,'' said Jerry Bailey, who won his third straight race of the day aboard Perfect Sting.</p>
        <p>He added: ''I had her in a comfortable spot down the backstretch, but with three-sixteenths of a mile to go, I didn't think we would get there.  Then, when we hit the eighth pole, she kept grinding into Snow Polina's lead. Aaron Gryder rode a great race on Snow Polina, but Perfect Sting wanted to win this.''</p>
        <p>Joe Orseno, who trains Perfect Sting for Frank Stronach, minced no words when he said, ''She has a lot of heart, and I still think this is the best grass filly in the country.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I have known for some time that she can run on any kind of turf. On that last eighth of a mile, she showed how good she really was. She dug in, and she knew where the wire was. This was probably one of the best fields she's beaten, and that includes her races last year.''</p>
        <p>Snow Polina, who is trained by Bill Mott for Gary Tanaka, has finished in the money in all six of her starts this year. Last month she ran third in the Just a Game Handicap at Belmont Park, which Perfect Sting also won. In their return match yesterday, Snow Polina led Perfect Sting and everybody else for almost every step of the mile and a quarter, but was nabbed by Perfect Sting as they crossed the wire.</p>
        <p>''You just hate getting beat by a nose at the end,'' Mott said. And Gryder offered this jockey's lament: ''She ran hard and had such a smooth, galloping stride. I thought I was home at the quarter-pole, but it took a champion to beat us.''</p>
        <p>Perfect Sting ran the mile and a quarter in 2:05 1/5 after Snow Polina had led through an understandably slow pace: half a mile in 50 2/5 seconds, one mile in 1:39. After half a mile, Perfect Sting was sixth, but only three lengths off the lead; after one mile, she was second, and taking aim.</p>
        <p>They dueled down the stretch until Perfect Sting won the photo finish, with Pico Teneriffe trailing them both in third place, four and a half lengths back.</p>
        <p>The winner paid $4.30 for a $2 bet to win and went home with $150,000, raising her career earnings to over $1 million.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Richter Scale set a Laurel track record for six furlongs and won for the fifth time in six starts when he captured the $300,000 Frank J. DeFrancis Memorial Dash at the Maryland track. The 6-year-old bay ran on or near the lead all the way and had a length and three-quarters on Just Call Me Carl at the wire. Richter Scale, who is trained by MARY JO LOHMEIER with RICHIE MIGLIORE riding, went off the 3-5 favorite. He ran the six furlongs in 1:074 5 , breaking the track record, 1:081 5 , set in 1992 by Fighting Notion. He won $180,000 and, like Perfect Sting, pushed his career earnings past $1 million.</p>
