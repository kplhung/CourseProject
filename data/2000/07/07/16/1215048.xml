        <p>The Harold Letters, 1928-1943</p>
        <p>The Making of an American</p>
        <p>Intellectual.</p>
        <p>By Clement Greenberg.</p>
        <p>Edited by Janice Van Horne.</p>

        <p>In 1961, the cultural critic Clement Greenberg received a package containing hundreds of letters, most dating from 1928 to 1943, from Greenberg to his college chum Harold Lazarus. Greenberg paid little attention to them; he and Lazarus had been incommunicado for years. When Greenberg died 33 years later, his widow, Janice Van Horne, assembled them into ''The Harold Letters: 1928-1943.'' The correspondence, written against a backdrop of national financial ruin, world war and the emergence of modernism, tells the lesser-known story of Greenberg's life before he had chosen his profession, when he seemed more likely to become a poet than the author of the ground-breaking essay ''Avant-Garde and Kitsch.'' In the 15 years following his graduation from Syracuse, Greenberg (1909-94) grappled with what Van Horne calls ''the passion and pain of being 20-something with a dream to follow.'' In the letters, he lusts like an adolescent, hastily marries, has a child whom he later neglects, gets drafted, has a nervous breakdown and drifts around the country and from career to career. To his best friend and only confidant, he writes candidly of these developments, and the result can be repelling; the Greenberg that emerges is often sexist, self-righteous and disillusioned. It is in this way that ''The Harold Letters'' distinguishes itself from other, more fallacious personal histories; his honesty unabashedly reveals the kind of unspeakable, grandiose desires that we all have for ourselves.</p>
