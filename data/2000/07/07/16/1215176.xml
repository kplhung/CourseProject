        <p>Karl Becker letter on Betsy Wade's June 11 column on pets flying in cargo holds of airplanes; notes his own experiences when traveling with his dog (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor: With regard to Betsy Wade's article ''Pets Flying as Cargo, Not Checked as Luggage'' (Correspondent's Report, June 11), I feel that taking any animal that is bigger than the limit allowed by the airlines for travel in the cabin is an ordeal for the animal as well as for the owner.</p>
        <p>As the owner of a 55-pound Dalmatian, I would think twice before putting the dog on a domestic flight  anywhere in the contiguous 48 states. I did take the dog to Europe, though, on four occasions for anywhere from four to six weeks. My experience with Lufthansa has been very good: four times across the Atlantic, four uneventful trips, eight happy reunions with the dog.</p>

        <p>One observation, though: I found that the airline's personnel treat dogs much better at their German hubs than at their New York area airports.</p>
