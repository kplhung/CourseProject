        <p>The rooms on these pages represent how race is lived at its most basic level: in the kitchens and living rooms of our homes. Using information culled from several comprehensive demographic and consumer surveys (Sources, Page 79), we furnished and stocked the rooms to reflect the average American white household and the average American black household. Each item can be found in at least half of the households of that race, and except for the appliances, the most popular brand of each product is pictured. While they cannot capture the diversity of experience in the United States, the items show how statistical averages can tell us how different, and how similar, those experiences are.</p>

        <p>The rooms on these pages represent how race is lived at its most basic level: in the kitchens and living rooms of our homes. Using information culled from several comprehensive demographic and consumer surveys (Sources, Page 79), we furnished and stocked the rooms to reflect the average American white household and the average American black household. Each item can be found in at least half of the households of that race, and except for the appliances, the most popular brand of each product is pictured. While they cannot capture the diversity of experience in the United States, the items show how statistical averages can tell us how different, and how similar, those experiences are.</p>
        <p>Some of the differences are attributable to lifestyle: 61 percent of whites live in suburbs; 55 percent of blacks live in cities. Some rise out of socioeconomic gaps: the median family income for whites is $35,750; for blacks, it is $20,000. While 73 percent of whites own their homes, 45 percent of blacks own theirs. Other differences stem from geography. Thirty-three percent of whites live in the South, compared with 53 percent of blacks, which may explain why, say, 11 percent of white households contain grits as opposed to 51 percent of black households. As Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, puts it: ''Grits, of course, has a lot more to do with the South. If you look at just whites in the South, you may find 50 percent eat grits as well.'' Still other differences are less easily explained, like a black preference for fruit drinks or a white preference for cottage cheese. In the end, there is just no accounting for taste.</p>
