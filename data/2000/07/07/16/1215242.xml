        <p>THIS weekend's Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, just over the state line in Hillsdale, N.Y., is one of the biggest folk festivals in the country. It has helped begin the careers of today's most successful contemporary singer-songwriters, Dar Williams included.</p>
        <p>''Falcon Ridge introduced me to a lot of industry people,'' said Ms. Williams, who will make her sixth appearance at the festival this weekend. ''Newport does that, too, but Falcon Ridge is more intense. It's a well-run festival.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams is one of more than 40 acts performing on Falcon Ridge's four stages. In addition to Ms. Williams, other nationally known acts include Richard Shindell, Hugh Blumenfeld, Janis Ian, John Gorka, Lucy Kaplansky, Moxy Fruvous, the Nields, John Gorka, Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys and Cliff Eberhardt.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Williams first performed at Falcon Ridge in 1995, she had one, self-produced CD, (''The Honesty Room'') released the previous year and was relatively unknown beyond the Boston club scene. After her festival debut, ''Honesty Room'' received frequent play from the country's top folk-radio stations and Ms. Williams started performing nationally rather than regionally.</p>
        <p>Now that she is in the upper echelon of singer-songwriters, Ms. Williams still looks forward to the gig. ''It's also been a galvanizing place for listeners of my music,'' she said in a telephone coversation from her home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. ''It's very invigorating.''</p>
        <p>One of Ms. Williams's most invigorating festival moments occurred last summer when she teamed up with her old friends Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky to reprise songs from the trio's ''Cry, Cry, Cry'' CD and tour. While Ms. Williams sang her song ''Iowa'' from her 1996 CD, ''Mortal City,'' her fans flicked their lighters. ''It's a known meeting ground,'' she said of the song. ''They rose to their feet with their lighters and I remember the whole hillside was lit up. It was incredibly powerful.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams didn't even consider a music career until after graduating from Wesleyan University 10 years ago. ''Since I was little,'' she said, ''I was interested in theater. I actually wanted to be a playwright.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams's love for dramatic literature is evident in her songwriting. Like Randy Newman and Louden Wainwright III, Ms. Williams writes from character. Rather than express her own perspective, she tries to climbs into the skin of other people and express their thoughts. ''The Poignant, Yet Pointless, Crisis of a Coed'' from ''Mortal City'' is a prime example. The song is the confession of a woman, housewife and mother who led the Hemp Liberation League during her college days.</p>
        <p>''You have no idea how tired I am of explaining that I'm not that person,'' she said. ''I'm not even married, don't have two kids, and don't live in Lexington, Mass.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams also has a playwright's sense of narrative. Her songs are terse one-act plays set to music, telling stories, complete with character, conflict and recognition. ''The Christians and the Pagans,'' also from ''Mortal City,'' comes to mind. As Ms. Williams said, ''it's a Christmas song for the 90's.'' It tells of lights, a tree and the unexpected arrival of young lesbian relatives.</p>
        <p>''In writing a song, I don't consciously structure a story at first,'' she said. ''Initially, I'm just writing out the thought. Later on, I shape it up. As in plays, I like to have a peripeteia in it.'' Ms. Williams, on the other hand, will not likely see any sudden or violent change in her career. She is, however, releasing her new CD, ''The Green World'' (Razor and Tie) in August. It is her fourth solo CD and the first since 1997. Her fans will hear a preview this weekend.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot of pressure, too, because all of the New England people are there,'' Ms. Williams said. ''Still, I'm looking forward to it.''</p>
        <p>The Falcon Ridge Folk Festival takes place from Friday through Sunday at Long Hill Farm in Hillsdale, N.Y.
