        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>What would I do? I would definitely approach our self-elected, pump-side deejay and ask him if he would please turn down the music at least while he's stopped for gas. Except that I would mouth the words to him silently, causing him to turn down the music to hear what I was saying. At that point, after the music is lowered, I would say (aloud this time), ''I was just saying it would be nice if you would turn down your music while you were stopped for gas, because it was hurting my ears. So thanks very much, I appreciate it.''  That's subterfuge, of course, but so what? Of course, if the gentleman decides to again turn up the volume I would then assume that reasoning with him would be to no avail. Therefore, I would smile and apologize for bothering him -- and back off. I can live with my attempt to be reasonable more easily than he will be able to live with his inability to get a rise out of me.</p>
