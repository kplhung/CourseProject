        <p>THE LAST NIGHT I SPENT WITH YOU</p>
        <p>By Mayra Montero.</p>
        <p>Translated by Edith Grossman.</p>
        <p>115 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $19.95.</p>
        <p>Of all the things that go into maintaining intimacy between two people, sex is probably the hardest to keep right. In Mayra Montero's telling, Fernando and Celia, after 25 years of marriage, make love as if by rote, without much passion or real involvement. Their sexual encounters have come to lack all drama and surprise; now, when it happens, it's ''as if we were packing suitcases.''</p>
        <p>But all of a sudden, there is a chance to reclaim the physical and emotional hungers of the past. Their daughter has just been married and they, freed from the burdens and concerns of parenthood, resolve to take a long-deferred cruise through the Caribbean, stopping at rarely visited islands, trying to rekindle the lusty spontaneity of yesterday.</p>
        <p>They do, after a fashion, but it turns into a far more complex and tortuous affair than either had imagined. Sex in middle age becomes less a rediscovery of a lost sensuality for them than an endless struggle for power and control, a destructive series of betrayals, deceits and mutual degradations all played out to the erotic yet melancholic musical strains of haunting boleros, the peculiarly Latin songs of love and loss.</p>
        <p>What makes the lovemaking in ''The Last Night I Spent With You'' squalid and debasing? It turns out that Celia has a past, an erotic interlude of which her husband knows nothing and in which she willingly humiliated herself with a virtual stranger again and again until ''I barely recognized myself in that submissive, flushed woman who walked behind him, unbuttoning her skirt.'' For his part, Fernando, though ignorant of his wife's infidelity, uses the occasion of the cruise to let go of his hang-ups, furthering her humiliation by falling into a fairly open affair with Julieta, another middle-aged passenger, with whom he is able to mix fantasy and reality into a heady stew of lust and depravity.</p>
        <p>Although the novel may sound a bit like a Hispanic version of an Erica Jong story, it's a little more complicated than that. Everything seems metaphor here: the sex, the interactions of the characters and the frequently degrading contests among them all represent something bigger and more central. Montero appears to be using the passion (misplaced and otherwise), deceits and indignities to explore how human beings struggle to get along with one another. Is it possible, the novel asks, to be true to one's desires and just as true to another person at the same time? The question looms large over the couple's increasingly desperate passions. Near the voyage's end, Fernando -- with shadows of mortality beginning to darken his ardor -- shows that all the deception has not entirely eroded trust by allowing Celia sole possession of Julieta's final secrets, and by that act more or less placing his life in her hands. And if there is still trust, maybe that's enough to sustain all the rest.</p>
        <p>Interspersed with the erotic convolutions on the cruise are mysterious letters from someone called Abel to his lover Angela, which in some ways mirror the mixed sexual hungers that dominate the novel. Not until the end is the real significance of this correspondence explained, and then it turns into yet another tale of love betrayed, with a final twist connecting it to Fernando and Celia. Had they been paying attention, in fact, the letters might have provided both a warning and a valuable lesson to the couple about how passion, carelessly handled, can go awry.</p>
        <p>Originally published in Spanish in 1991, ''The Last Night I Spent With You'' is this Cuban-born author's third work to appear in English. In Edith Grossman's easily flowing translation, it is, like the others (''In the Palm of Darkness'' and ''The Messenger''), symbolically and emotionally charged. While the sex may be too brutal and too awash in selfishness for some, the novel is certainly provocative, and it certainly challenges a few cherished assumptions, which is what fiction, at its best, should do.</p>
