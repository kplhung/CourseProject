        <p>If you're in the market for a cow, Helga Tacreiter can be of some help.</p>
        <p>She doesn't use cloning or gene therapy, but rather a combination of sewing and vegetarianism to create what she calls a ''cowch.''</p>
        <p>These creations are life-size animal floor pillows, each named and individually patterned after the cattle tended by Ms. Tancreiter. The herd is an odd mix of cows and bulls that includes Jersey, Mexican, Scottish Highland and Black Angus breeds she has taken in over the years. So far, more than 1,000 cowches graze people's homes.</p>
        <p>One of her higher-profile customers is Gateway, the computer maker based in San Diego, whose company logo is a black-and-white cow printed on its shipping boxes.</p>
        <p>The 48-year-old Ms. Tacreiter lives on an 80-acre farm just south of Shilo, in Hopewell Township, where she has spent the past 10 years raising what she calls ''companion cattle'' -- 15 bovine pets. She is, it should be noted, a vegetarian.</p>
        <p>While she started with a herd of six calves, other cattle have been brought to her farm for fostering from animal lovers from around the state as well as the group called Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, N.Y.,  PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Amimals) and individuals from Pennsylvania and Maryland</p>
        <p>Sometimes she keeps the animals, and sometimes they move on to Farm Sanctuary. ''It depends on how the animal fits in with the herd,'' Ms. Tacreiter said.</p>
        <p>Born in Gdansk, Poland, Ms. Tacreiter moved several times after her parents -- her mother was a chemist and her father a psychiatrist -- divorced when she was a toddler. Her mother moved to Nova Scotia, and her father raised her.</p>
        <p>Helga and her father moved to England when she was 5, then to Ontario at the age of 7, and finally settled in Maryland when she was 12. She attended California State University, where she majored in English literature.</p>
        <p>''If I didn't go to some college somewhere,'' she said, ''my father would have been heart-broken.'</p>
        <p>While at the university she met a young man who lived in Shilo and decided to follow him here. Last year, after 23 years, their relationship ended.</p>
        <p>''He's a neat freak and I'm a slob and it became unbearable on both sides,'' she said.</p>
        <p>During their time together she did odd jobs at local farms and crafted tiny replicas of homes that she sold. She wrote ''Possum Huts'' -- a photo book of the intricately detailed miniature homes with stained-glass windows and hand-dipped taper candles that she made herself -- which was published in 1984.</p>
        <p>She said she decided to become a vegetarian after reading Upton Sinclair's ''The Jungle'' in high school. ''Everyone else saw the animals representing people, but I also saw the slaughter of the animals and that stuck with me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, while working for a local horse ranch that also had a small herd of cattle, Ms. Tacreiter first began rescuing livestock.</p>
        <p>''It started out when I was taking care of this really sick calf, Harvey,'' she said. ''The herd I was caring for was struck by lightning one night and the 15 adults were killed. Six calves survived and Harvey was in shock and very ill.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tacreiter took Harvey home and spent weeks tending him.</p>
        <p>''I would snuggle with him,'' she said. ''I had this teddy bear when I was 2 that was as big as I was and this reminded me of those days. One day I woke up and realized that here I was spending all this time healing this animal that we're going to slaughter.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tacreiter convinced the farmer to give her the calves, which she determined to save from human consumption.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking about it one day and I thought that if people had stuffed cows instead of teddy bears they would relate to them and not want to eat them,'' she went on. ''Then I thought I really wanted to reach adults, too, so I thought having the animal be big enough for an adult to cuddle would be ideal.''.</p>
        <p>With that, she was off to the fabric shop to gather materials and try her hand at creating a life-size stuffed cow. Returning to the farm with several bolts of faux fur material, she found Harvey was keenly interested in her project and followed her around.</p>
        <p>''I decided to try modeling the fabric and pinning it on Harvey,'' she said. ''He stood still for five hours while I made the first pattern right on him.''</p>
        <p>The first effort was a minor disaster. ''I had home economics in eigth grade and that's about the extent of my sewing training,'' she said. ''It looked like an alien cow. I keep it in the attic.''</p>
        <p>Subsequent attempts improved her results, and today Ms. Tacreiter turns out about 100 cowches a year on her own, and more if she hires help.</p>
        <p>The creations range in price from $300 for a calf to $500 for a yearling and $800 for an adult-sized cowch. She also does horses. The sale of the cowches and her book -- along with donations -- keep home and herd together.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, at Gateway's request, Ms. Tacreiter created a cowch with a black world map instead of spots, for which she was rewarded with a computer. ''The World Cow,'' she said, sits today in the office of the company's chief executive, Ted Waitt.</p>
        <p>On the whole, Ms. Tacreiter prefers transactions to be cash cows rather than items for barter since it costs about $1,000 a year to feed each cow and about the same amount for each of the two horses. Ms. Tacreiter raises her own hay top help keep costs down.</p>
        <p>''Let's just say that my life has always run on miracles,'' Ms. Tacreiter said. ''Just when I'm sure I can't make the mortgage, like now, something happens to pull us through. I'm waiting for the next one.''</p>
