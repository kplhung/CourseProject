      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There is something essentially American about the compulsion to peddle one's junk to people who are equally eager to acquire it. Whether it's a garage sale, a yard sale, a flea market or a California swap meet, the exercise seems to feed a nation's need to uncover that irresistible bargain. Ah, the uses of disuse. Which is why Mitra Modarressi's YARD SALE! (DK Ink, $15.95; ages 5 to 9) should find a knowing and appreciative audience.</p>
        <p>In the quiet town of Spudville, the aptly named Mr. Flotsam unburdens his basement of detritus and hawks the entire bundle to the neighbors. But in this lovely tale, there's an unexpected twist. Once sold, Mr. Flotsam's junk turns weird. The beat-up rug becomes a flying carpet; an old typewriter spontaneously begins to write the town memoirs; a telephone rings with calls from the likes of Amelia Earhart; a packet of seeds spawns a gargantuan garden; a pasta machine noodles on endlessly. Irked at these fanciful developments, the buyers show their neighbors how Mr. Flotsam has hornswoggled them, only to discover that the neighbors are amazed to find such wonders in their midst.</p>

        <p>In the quiet town of Spudville, the aptly named Mr. Flotsam unburdens his basement of detritus and hawks the entire bundle to the neighbors. But in this lovely tale, there's an unexpected twist. Once sold, Mr. Flotsam's junk turns weird. The beat-up rug becomes a flying carpet; an old typewriter spontaneously begins to write the town memoirs; a telephone rings with calls from the likes of Amelia Earhart; a packet of seeds spawns a gargantuan garden; a pasta machine noodles on endlessly. Irked at these fanciful developments, the buyers show their neighbors how Mr. Flotsam has hornswoggled them, only to discover that the neighbors are amazed to find such wonders in their midst.</p>
        <p>So, with the magic pasta maker in hand, Mr. Rotelli opens his own four-star spaghetti place, Ristorante Rotelli. The time-warp telephone provides its owner, formerly Mrs. Applebee, now Madame Olga, with a direct line to the dead. Mr. and Mrs. Zing's magic carpet sails neighborhood kids into hours of sky-high entertainment. And who's to say that's not the dream of every yard sale aficionado -- the discovery of a lemon that turns to gold?</p>
        <p>Modarressi, the illustrator of Anne Tyler's ''Tumble Tower'' as well as several books of her own, employs delightful watercolors to capture the dot-eyed, round-faced, sometimes electric-haired folks who just happen to live next door. For the finale, she has the good sense to leave young readers with their imaginations in overdrive. She brings back Mr. Flotsam, who is planning yet another yard sale. What secondhand fantasy, every young reader is sure to wonder, will he be peddling this time?</p>
