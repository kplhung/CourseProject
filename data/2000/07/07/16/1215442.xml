        <p>Richard A. Grasso, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, couldn't let pass a chance to urge John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, to switch his listing from Nasdaq. Mr. Chambers was at a stock exchange banquet on Thursday night to receive a chief executive of the year award from Chief Executive magazine, which is distributed to corporate leaders.</p>
        <p>''If ever there is to be a celebration of Cisco's listing on the N.Y.S.E., it will be a combination of the visionary leadership of John Chambers and the arm-twisting of his mom and dad, who are with us tonight,'' Mr. Grasso said. ''Not to in any way shortchange his bride, who said today, 'If he lists, do I get to ring the bell?' ''</p>

        <p>Richard A. Grasso, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, couldn't let pass a chance to urge John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems, to switch his listing from Nasdaq. Mr. Chambers was at a stock exchange banquet on Thursday night to receive a chief executive of the year award from Chief Executive magazine, which is distributed to corporate leaders.</p>
        <p>''If ever there is to be a celebration of Cisco's listing on the N.Y.S.E., it will be a combination of the visionary leadership of John Chambers and the arm-twisting of his mom and dad, who are with us tonight,'' Mr. Grasso said. ''Not to in any way shortchange his bride, who said today, 'If he lists, do I get to ring the bell?' ''</p>
        <p>Herbert D. Kelleher, the previous chief executive of the year, said he was tempering his remarks in presenting the award, lest Mr. Chambers take offense and add Southwest Airlines to his list of acquisitions. ''I do have to confess, John, that my sole truck at networking was being the only boy in my high school's home economics class,'' Mr. Kelleher said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chambers laughed at Mr. Grasso and Mr. Kelleher, but gave no indication in his own speech that his wife, Elaine, would be ringing the opening bell there any time soon.</p>
