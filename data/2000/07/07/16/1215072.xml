        <p>Getting to Stromboli</p>
        <p>Q. After several tantalizing glimpses of Stromboli from cruise ships, I at last got there in 1998. The trip, however, was arduous, involving planes, train and hydrofoil. Is there a less grueling way now? Jan E. Adlmann, Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
        <p>A. The island of Stromboli, about 40 miles north of Sicily, has been in continuous eruption for 2,000 to 2,500 years -- and even more, according to some volcanologists. Over the course of each hour, there are several small gas explosions of glowing lava fragments. But violent eruptions are rare; the most recent of note was in 1996 when four people were hurt.</p>

        <p>Getting to Stromboli</p>
        <p>Q. After several tantalizing glimpses of Stromboli from cruise ships, I at last got there in 1998. The trip, however, was arduous, involving planes, train and hydrofoil. Is there a less grueling way now? Jan E. Adlmann, Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
        <p>A. The island of Stromboli, about 40 miles north of Sicily, has been in continuous eruption for 2,000 to 2,500 years -- and even more, according to some volcanologists. Over the course of each hour, there are several small gas explosions of glowing lava fragments. But violent eruptions are rare; the most recent of note was in 1996 when four people were hurt.</p>
        <p>To reach Stromboli from the United States, you still have to fly to Rome first. If you want to avoid multiple stops and to go to Stromboli without stopping at the other Lipari Islands first, fly to Naples or Reggio di Calabria and then take a boat.</p>
        <p>The Siremar ferry line departs from Naples for Stromboli daily except Wednesday at 9 p.m. and arrives as a new day is dawning, at 5 a.m. Ticket prices range from $33.40 for unreserved deck space to $56.50 for reserved space in an enclosed lounge-like area, at 2,034 lire to the dollar. Among the sources for a ticket is the Ontano agency in Naples, (39-081) 580 0340, fax (39-081) 580 0341. By hydrofoil, it's faster -- four hours -- but perhaps not so romantic.  Departures are at 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. and the fare is $51.65.</p>
        <p>Most of the hydrofoils from Reggio di Calabria, which is across the Strait of Messina from Sicily, go directly to Stromboli. They leave at 7, 7:25, 8:55 and 10:45 a.m. and take about two hours. The fare is $17.70.</p>
        <p>Information on hydrofoil service, which is operated by SNAV, can be found on the Web at www.snavali .com, but may require a measure of competence in Italian (for starters, click on ''aliscafi,'' which means hydrofoils). Or try (39-081) 761-2348, fax (39-081) 761-2141.</p>
        <p>To refresh your memory of Stromboli, take a look at these rich  resources, which include video clips with audio: stromboli.net and  volcano.und.nodak.edu.</p>
        <p>Archery in London</p>
        <p>Q. My 7-year-old nephew will accompany us to central London, and he likes archery. Are there schools or ranges there where he can practice and learn? -- Ruth A. Unterberg, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. Though many clubs do not accept children younger than 12, archery instruction for a 7-year-old is not out of the question in the view of some instructors. But the problem  may be having to go to the outskirts of London to find such instruction.</p>
        <p>Here are two possibilities for experienced instructors who have taught adults and children. The charge includes a bow, arrows, a tab (which protects the fingers) and a bracer (which protects the forearm of the hand holding the bow).</p>
        <p>Falcon Junior Archery Club, Royal Arsenal Sport and Recreation Association, Church Manor Way, Abbeywood, London SE2 0EZ. The club's chairman and senior coach, Edward Hart, teaches once a week for two to three hours. After three sessions students are generally ''fairly consistent, but not necessarily proficient,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lessons are given at a field that is a drive of 30 to 40 minutes from central London. The charge for private instruction is a total of $36, at 66 pence to the dollar, said Mr. Hart, who has taught archers in county-level competitions. He can be reached at (44-208) 311 3416.</p>
        <p>At the Falcon Junior Club, students start out with a solid fiberglass training bow (like an American longbow) or a recurve bow, similar to that used in Olympic events.</p>
        <p>Ted Bradford is an instructor and coach based at 62 Hook Rise North, Tolworth, Surrey KT6 7JY; (44-208) 397 2603; e-mail ted@theglade.co.uk. With children up to the age of 10 or 11, he said, ''I don't insist on perfect application until they start asking questions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradford, who has taught archers competing in international competitions, said that lessons would not exceed an hour and that a 7-year-old would probably start with a fiberglass bow. Private instruction for a 7-year-old, given at an outdoor site, is roughly $6 an hour.</p>
        <p>For general information about archery in Britain, call the Grand National Archery Society at (44-195) 267 7888 or visit www.gnas.org.</p>
        <p>By Rail in Provence</p>
        <p>Q. I am planning to spend some time this September in the south of France, particularly Nice. I have read about a narrow gauge railroad from Nice north through the Var Valley. The train is called Chemin de Fer de Provence. Can you provide information, including schedule and stops? -- G. G., Tiburon, Calif.</p>
        <p>A. The railroad runs 93 miles between Nice, on the Riviera, and Digne-les-Bain. Of special interest is a 12-mile stretch between Puget-Theniers and Annot. During the warmer months, one can take an hourlong ride aboard the Train des Pignes using equipment built between 1888 and 1912.</p>
        <p>The regular train between Nice and Digne-les-Bain operates four times a day in each direction and is well suited for travelers who are not in a hurry: It takes three hours and makes 21 stops. From Nice, departures are at 6:42 and 9 a.m. and at 12:43, 5 and 6:35 p.m. From Digne-les-Bain, departures are at 7 and 10:33 a.m. and at 1:58 and 5:25 p.m.</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, Digne-les-Bain is a spa. Every August, the town celebrates the lavender for which towns in the region are known. From the fourth to the eighth, Digne-les-Bain stages the Corso de la Lavande, a parade of floats saluting lavender, with musical performances and fireworks. From the 17th to the 22nd, it's the Journees Lavande, which features music as well as ethnic food. Information: (33-4) 92.36.62.62.</p>
        <p>The town is also the home of the cathedrals of St.-Jerome and Notre-Dame du Bourg and of a collection of Tibetan mementoes at the Fondation Alexandra David-Neel (27, avenue Marechal Juin). Tours there run 90 minutes and are free.</p>
        <p>Excursions aboard old train equipment run on Sundays, starting in mid-May. The trips remaining this season are next Sunday as well as on Aug. 6, 13, 20 and 27, Sept. 10, 17 and 24 and Oct. 8, 15 and 22.</p>
        <p>Diesel trains leave Nice at 9:10 a.m., arriving at Puget-Theniers at 10:45. Ten minutes later a steam locomotive takes over for the ride to Annot, a small town with winding lanes, arcades and a Romanesque church. The train leaves for Nice at 3:30 and arrives at 6:30. For the entire run, the fare is $26, at 7 francs to the dollar; for just the steam engine part, it's $13. Train information: (33-4) 97.03.80.87.</p>
