        <p>RECENTLY I received an e-mail message on behalf of a trio of would-be documentarians seeking money to finance a film to tell the world what really happened to Trans World Airlines Flight 800, which crashed off Moriches Inlet four years ago tomorrow, killing all 230 aboard. The group includes one of the most influential of the conspiracy theorists, Kelly O'Meara, who at the time of the crash was the administrative assistant to the East End's congressman, Michael P. Forbes.</p>
        <p>The investigation into the cause of the Flight 800 disaster cost millions of dollars. Thousands of experts were consulted. In August, the National Transportation Safety Board will formally announce its determination of the probable cause: that a combination of electrical problems and a faulty fuel system design sparked an explosion in the Boeing 747's center fuel tank, breaking the plane in two.</p>
        <p>But Ms. O'Meara and her associates are certain: the public won't get the truth from the safety board.</p>
        <p>If the public is misled, it is these promoters of a government cover-up theory who should take the blame. By manipulating the facts they have obscured the real air safety issue brought to light by the tragedy of T.W.A. Flight 800.</p>
        <p>I'd bet that more people suspect a missile caused the explosion on the 747 than know a basic fact of commercial aviation: during flight, the center fuel tank on a Boeing plane is in an explosive state as much as 30 percent of the time. The right mix of fuel vapors, air and heat creates a bomb-like condition that needs only a source of ignition to blow up.</p>
        <p>The publicity after the crash of Flight 800 shamed the Federal Aviation Administration into finally conceding that fuel tanks on some models of aircraft are at risk of exploding an unacceptably high percentage of the time.</p>
        <p>Don't be fooled into thinking that the F.A.A. acted quickly in reaching that conclusion, however. The aviation agency knew for decades that the practice of isolating wiring and other potential ignition sources from fuel tanks was not effective enough to prevent explosions. The policy failed at least 13 times on commercial airliners, beginning with a Pan Am Boeing 707 crash in 1963 and an explosion just 11 months later in Rome on another 707, coincidentally also T.W.A. Flight 800. A total of 130 people died in those two events, and over the years the explosions and the deaths continued.</p>
        <p>There were solutions to the problem of exploding fuel tanks as far back as the late 1960's. The Air Force was using the solutions on some aircraft. But in the process of designing its first 747, Boeing declined to incorporate explosion protection technology on the jumbo jet because it was too heavy and too expensive.</p>
        <p>Weighing how much a fix will cost against how much it will help is standard in aviation and many other industries. Boeing used the cost-benefit analysis again and again to argue successfully that the F.A.A. should not order the company to install explosion protection in fuel tanks. Decades passed, and eventually the issue just faded into obscurity.</p>
        <p>It might have stayed there had T.W.A.'s flight to Paris on July 17, 1996, not blown up 13 minutes after taking off from the world's biggest media market. The plane came down in a ball of light and a cloud of mystery.</p>
        <p>Four years later the mystery is solved. Flight 800 has convinced the safety board that the Boeing fuel tank design is dangerous and should be modified. But beyond asking the F.A.A. to make changes, it can do little else.</p>
        <p>The investigative documentarians should stop worrying about Navy ships and radar tapes and start asking the aviation administration why it has not acted to reduce this hazard on Boeing jetliners. Then they might find the cover-up conspiracy they are so eager to expose.</p>
