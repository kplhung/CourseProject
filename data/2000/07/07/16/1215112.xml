        <p>Julie Armstrong and Talila Harlmon, Comanche, Tex.</p>
        <p>Armstrong (seated, second from left): I love cheerleading because you do it for somebody else, not for yourself. And cheerleaders are the ones on the honor roll, the class officers, everything. The team is different races, but you never even think about it. We all just feel the same. We're friends. With Talila, we're not really close friends. But my friends, we don't notice her by saying, ''Oh, she's different.'' When we went to cheerleading camp, I noticed there was a school with all black cheerleaders and one white girl. I think it made her feel better to see that there are places like that.</p>
        <p>Harlmon (standing, second from left): I wanted to be a cheerleader because they're the popular people. Me and my brother are the only two black people in school. My brother hangs out with the Mexican kids. I do things by myself a lot. I feel like I have to try harder to fit in. That's why I keep my hair braided and long, to look like the other girls. If I had a 'fro, I don't know what people would say. I wouldn't go out with it natural. The other girls, they go out to get their hair done -- but I can't go, because the hairstylists here can't do my hair. I wish there were more black kids. I'd have someone to relate to in history class, when they're talking about the slaves or Martin Luther King. If I were at a school with black kids, I could go to their house, they could come to mine. With a bunch of kids' parents here, the white girls can't date Hispanics or blacks. It bothers me. Some people aren't like that. I went to the prom with a white boy whose parents didn't mind. But sometimes kids in our school will be having a party, and if I find out and say why wasn't I invited, you could tell that they really want to invite me but they can't. Their parents think that black people steal, or they're just scared. But my mom takes me places, and we go do stuff. My mom tells me it's just life, you just have to deal with it.</p>
