        <p>FOR visitors and San Diegans alike, the city offers some great attractions: the San Diego Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and SeaWorld San Diego.</p>
        <p>But family outings can quickly get expensive and, without a game plan, can leave everyone out of sorts and unsatisfied. Doing some homework before buying tickets and mapping out a route through the attractions can help save money, time and energy. In San Diego, as at increasing numbers of theme parks and family-oriented attractions, it may be worth becoming an annual member, or buying combination passes, rather than buying separate single tickets, even if you're planning to visit only once.

        <p>FOR visitors and San Diegans alike, the city offers some great attractions: the San Diego Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and SeaWorld San Diego.</p>
        <p>But family outings can quickly get expensive and, without a game plan, can leave everyone out of sorts and unsatisfied. Doing some homework before buying tickets and mapping out a route through the attractions can help save money, time and energy. In San Diego, as at increasing numbers of theme parks and family-oriented attractions, it may be worth becoming an annual member, or buying combination passes, rather than buying separate single tickets, even if you're planning to visit only once. You won't be able to put your wallet away -- there are extra-cost features beyond the entrance gate, not to mention lunch, snacks and souvenirs to buy -- but at least you'll be starting out ahead of the game.</p>
        <p>Some of the Choices</p>
        <p>The San Diego Zoological Society offers an annual membership that is a bargain: a dual membership is $76 (less for renewals), and children's memberships are $19 each. (A single adult membership is $60.) These provide unlimited visits to both the zoo and the animal park, including free passage on the zoo's aerial tram, the Skyfari, along with a sheet of coupons and discounts.</p>
        <p>With a day's general admission to the zoo running $18, and $8 for children ages 3 to 11, not including the $1.50 cost of a Skyfari ride, and with a day at the animal park costing $21.95 for adults and $14.95 for children, the society membership can pay for itself after one visit to each place. Short-term visitors can also buy a pass offering one day at the zoo and one day at the animal park in a five-day period, which costs $38.35 for adults and $23.15 for children.</p>
        <p>SeaWorld, with day admission $40 for adults and $30 for children 3 to 11, also offers an annual pass that costs $74.95 for each adult and $59.95 for children and those 55 and older; it includes free parking (normally $7 for cars). A Rockin' Summer Nights Pass can be be obtained with a single day's paid admission, entitling the holder to return for free after 4 p.m. on any or every night before Labor Day. And a three-for-one pass allows unlimited admission during a five-day period to the zoo, the animal park and SeaWorld for $75 for adults and $55 for children.</p>
        <p>Single-day entry fees are sometimes discounted through coupon promotions with fast-food franchises, newspapers, or other theme parks. SeaWorld, for example, has a deal with the local Subway sandwich chain that knocks $5 off a day's admission for up to six people per coupon. A Southern California Value Pass offers unlimited admission to SeaWorld and Universal Studios Hollywood over any 14 consecutive days for $75 adults and $55 children.</p>
        <p>At the San Diego Zoo, highlights of the day, including ''enrichment activities,'' when various animals get to play with something new and different, are posted on a big board at the zoo's entrance, just in front of the Flamingo Lagoon. The prime attraction at the zoo these days is Hua Mei, the panda cub born last August. Zoo gates open at 7:30 a.m. and shut at 9 p.m. through Labor Day, with the zoo closing at 10 p.m. The panda exhibit is open from 8 to 11:30 a.m. and from 4 to 8 p.m., with the bonus that the animals are more likely to be frisky in the cooler hours. Other nighttime entertainment includes music, magic shows and animal interactions.</p>
        <p>Getting around the zoo's 110 acres can be a challenge. The easiest option is a Kangaroo Bus Tour pass, which entitles holders to hop on and off as the bus circles the zoo. The cost is $8, $5 for children 3 to 11. The Skyfari ride, aside from providing a bird's-eye view of the gorilla enclosure and Balboa Park's ornate 1915 California Tower, connects the entrance side to the western side of the zoo. Visitors can walk down into Bongo Canyon near the center of the zoo to see the pandas, and, to save energy, can use people-moving ramps to get up and out.</p>
        <p>There are places to eat and drink throughout and near the park. Try the snack bars near the entrance, or Albert's Treehouse, a pleasant, full-service restaurant built on a breezy series of platforms overlooking Bongo Canyon. Another option is the new Prado restaurant, an upscale place a short distance from the zoo in Balboa Park's House of Hospitality. It's possible to leave the zoo and return the same day by getting your hand stamped at the exit.</p>
        <p>Out of Africa</p>
        <p>The Wild Animal Park, on 1,800 acres near Escondido, Calif., 30 miles north of San Diego, presents its own challenges: its inland valley gets above 100 degrees most summer days and the lines for the park's 55-minute railway ride can be long and tedious.</p>
        <p>The park is open from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. through Labor Day, when it will begin closing again at 5. Heart of Africa, a lakeside exhibit in the midst of what looks like an African savanna, features evening performances by Bomani, a dance and drum troupe from West Africa, and encounters between animals and their keepers.</p>
        <p>The newest attraction at the park is Condor Ridge, a rocky hillside about 10 minutes' walk from the park entrance. Five California condors, an endangered species brought back from near-extinction through a captive breeding program (the zoological society has been a key participant in it) live in a six-story aviary on the hillside. The huge boulders serve as launching pads for the birds -- whose wingspans range up to 10 feet -- as well as places for them to roost.</p>
        <p>The best time to visit the ridge is early in the morning, after the condors are first fed, or very late in the afternoon, when the setting sun provides a gilded view of the park and the lion enclosure below. Condor Ridge is also home to other rare and endangered animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the desert tortoise.</p>
        <p>Despite the lines, most visitors to the park do take the Wgasa Bush Line Railway, which loops five miles around grazing groups of giraffe, gazelles, rhinos, elephants and other  wildlife from Asia and Africa.</p>
        <p>One way to avoid the wait for the train is to buy a preferred boarding pass ($4, $3 children) at the railway station and get on the next train, which otherwise would be free.</p>
        <p>Visitors board the train at a different point from where they get off. Once off, you can walk to the right to the Petting Kraal and Mombasa Lagoon, or to the left to Lorikeet Landing, where you can buy food to feed the lorikeets, which are colorful South American birds about the size of a robin. Also to the left is the Hidden Jungle exhibit, with its butterflies and cutter ants. Nearby is the Mombasa Island Cooker, the most diverse of the park's eateries; it serves Asian and Italian food and salads and has tables that overlook the lagoon.</p>
        <p>A three-minute walk from the lagoon is a meandering path that passes by a children's playground and into the Heart of Africa, a simulated East African environment. At Jameson Research Island, set up like a study camp, there usually is an opportunity to interact with an animal like an aardvark or an African crested porcupine, with help from a park educator.</p>
        <p>Although SeaWorld San Diego weaves educational and conservation messages into its programs, it's still an amusement park, with interactive displays that include dolphin feeding and hands-on exhibits of starfish and bat rays. And there are several thrill rides, like whitewater rafting on Shipwreck Rapids and Wild Arctic, a hair-raising virtual helicopter flight in a simulated polar storm.</p>
        <p>And Now, 4D</p>
        <p>New this summer is ''Pirates 4D,'' a sensorama movie about a bunch of hapless pirates. Special effects include, in addition to the usual 3D in-your-face whangers, such novelties as water spritzing from the seats, little electric shocks from the seat backs and warm-water droplets spattering from above (those darned birds!).</p>
        <p>Still, the centerpiece of SeaWorld's attractions are the justly famous marine mammal shows featuring trained sea lions, dolphins and Shamu, the orca star. Some lines can be long at the amusement shows. Build in plenty of waiting time.</p>
        <p>Before entering SeaWorld, stop at the guest relations booth for advice and to make sure the maps given out at the parking lot kiosks are current (ours wasn't). The maps are supposed to list the day's special events. As it was, we were advised to pick the shows we wanted to see and visit the attractions nearby, while generally circling the park's perimeter.</p>
        <p>Directly inside the entry gates is the reservation center, which can book tours of the park or reserve seats at the daily, all-you-can-eat Dine With Shamu buffet. After filling your plate, you eat at poolside tables as Shamu, supervised by trainers, performs feats like resting his nose on the pool's edge often as close as a few feet away. Including tax, the cost is $27.47 for adults and $13.95 for children.</p>
        <p>A 90-minute Behind the Scenes  tour costs $8 for adults, $7 for ages 55 and up and children 3 to 11. A Spotlight Tour lasting two hours features interactions with various animals and costs $22, $18 for children. Petting the bottlenose dolphins is popular, so it's best to arrive fairly early, bearing dead fish bought nearby. SeaWorld also has a dolphin interaction pool, where visitors, in loaned wetsuits and booties, can swim for about 20 minutes with an actual dolphin. The cost is $125 a person, with admission to the park required but not included. Reservations are suggested: (877) 436-5746.</p>
        <p>The Bayside Skyride, an aerial gondola across part of Mission Bay and back, and the Skytower ride, a circling observation deck that climbs the needle at the park's center, are cool and quiet. The cost is $2.25 each, $3.50 for both.</p>
        <p>The sunniest day is Monday</p>
        <p>When planning a visit, remember that theme parks generally are most crowded on Saturdays, water parks on Sunday. As each weekday passes, popularity accelerates, with Monday typically the least crowded, Friday the most crowded. Many parks can provide information on admission discounts through their general information line, and it's easier to figure out the numbers before you get to the admissions gate with impatient children.</p>
        <p>SeaWorld Adventure Park San Diego; (619) 226-3901; www.seaworld.com.</p>
