        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I applaud the Clinton administration's move to delay the first federal execution in more than 40 years (news article, July 11). If President Clinton is as obsessed with his legacy as we sometimes hear, he must take further steps on this issue, like imposing a federal moratorium on executions and creating a federal panel to investigate geographic and racial disparities in the penalty's application.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton must also speak out. His failure to do so is troubling, particularly when he has spoken so eloquently on other equal rights issues.</p>

        <p>The national debate indicates public unease over the fairness of the system. Few are willing to believe that the flaws exposed in Illinois, which led Gov. George Ryan to declare a moratorium on executions, are limited to that state.</p>
