        <p>The article about a possible bridge from Oyster Bay to Rye [''If You Bought the Brooklyn Bridge, Here's Another One for Sale,'' June 25] reminds me of my small part in squelching a prior effort.</p>
        <p>I was an engineer in the employ of a small consulting firm in New York City. In the mid- to late-1960's, there was an announcement of the intent to extend the Seaford-Oyster Bay Expressway north of Jericho Turnpike.</p>
        <p>The residents in its projected path, (then as now) having the wherewithal to guard their interests, set up a committee to fight this, fearing it was the first step to building a bridge that Robert Moses had suggested.</p>
        <p>The committee therefore looked for an engineer to advance their argument that there was no legitimate traffic forecast that would justify such an extension, knowing full well that the bridge proponents would not dare say it was a first step for Moses' hoped-for bridge.</p>
        <p>Most engineering firms did not want to oppose Moses, but we took the job. We gathered traffic counts, made forecasts and demonstrated clearly that there was indeed no traffic-related reason to extend the Expressway. Our report may have stopped the extension.</p>
        <p>But the idea is probably not dead. About a dozen years ago the Nassau chapter of the New York State Society of Professional Engineers surveyed residents, asking about the need for a bridge and the most sensible location. The options were Oyster Bay, Port Jefferson and Orient.</p>
        <p>The people surveyed felt that there should be a bridge, and said the best place would be Port Jefferson.</p>
        <p>One of my own actions as an officer of the engineers' society was to try to get some co-operation from our Connecticut counterparts in seeing what their residents thought. I hit a stone wall: residents of Connecticut seemed to feel the bridge would just be a source of traffic jams.</p>
        <p>But someday, . . .</p>
