        <p>SINCE the early 1980's, Chrysler has cultivated a reputation for daring, innovative designs, beating bigger rivals by creating the minivan market and by revitalizing the full-size pickup truck market with the burly Dodge Ram. Just this year, its new PT Cruiser, an eccentric combination of a 1930's gangster car and a minivan, has been such a hot seller that dealers across the country have months-long waiting lists.</p>
        <p>So four years ago, when Chrysler formed a team to start designing the next generation of minivans for introduction late this summer, the pressure was fierce to come up with another big step forward. After all, Chrysler invented the traditional minivan in 1983, producing a vehicle that Ford Motor and General Motors had studied for years but never had the courage to build. Chrysler has dominated the minivan market ever since with breakthroughs like the introduction of driver's-side sliding doors in 1995.</p>
        <p>But a few months before the minivan team was formed in February 1996, Chrysler executives were shocked by the public's hostile reaction to Ford's radical restyling of its Taurus sedan and wagon. Customers deserted the Taurus in droves, allowing the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry to seize the lead in the midsize car market. So as work began on the new minivans, Chrysler officials struggled to understand what had happened.</p>
        <p>The results of their deliberations are in, and the new minivans will go on sale in late August. After much market research, which found that many buyers liked their minivans pretty much the way they were, Chrysler, now part of DaimlerChrysler A.G., decided to play it cautious. They made many small changes in their minivans -- the Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country -- offering, among other things, more powerful engines and an optional, powered rear liftgate that goes up and down at the push of a button. But they did not alter the fundamental design.</p>
        <p>Ford's experience with the Taurus ''set the fear in,'' said David C. McKinnon, Chrysler's director of vehicle exterior design. ''You don't want to depart too much from your script if you have a successful product.''</p>
        <p>Corporations capture headlines when they make big changes in products with household names. Sometimes those changes prove disastrous, as when Coca-Cola introduced New Coke. But far more common are the modest changes that companies make periodically, even in best-selling products, to keep them from seeming out of date.</p>
        <p>Chrysler executives say their decisions reflected a careful balancing of risks. The managers worried about the dangers of not going far enough, which could result in losing less-loyal customers to rival minivans like the Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, Ford Windstar and Pontiac Montana. They fretted about the popularity of sport utility vehicles, which now outsell minivans by more than two to one, and made some adjustments to give the minivans a slightly more ''aggressive'' appearance.</p>
        <p>BUT in the end, they punted. They stuck with a basic design that has led the market since 1983 and was last restyled in the mid-1990's. Yet its market share has eroded to 42 percent, and other automakers now make models that look similar, score better on government crash tests and offer conveniences like third rows of seats that fold into the floor of the cargo area.</p>
        <p>''We basically came to the conclusion that the formula was the thing to preserve,'' said Gordon L. Rinschler, the engineer and DaimlerChrysler vice president who oversaw the minivan redesign project.</p>
        <p>Rival automakers, which have long struggled to catch Chrysler in the minivan market, contend that Chrysler has decided to milk the profits from selling to repeat buyers, instead of spending the money to attract new ones. ''We're raising the bar, whereas Chrysler decided to invest its money elsewhere,'' said Jim Townsend, the marketing manager for the recently updated Ford Windstar, the nation's second-best selling minivan after the Dodge Caravan.</p>
        <p>Chrysler executives reject that interpretation.</p>
        <p>But marketing experts say DaimlerChrysler's decision to make incremental changes is fairly typical of big companies these days, as so many are loath to experiment with proven success.</p>
        <p>Instead, when companies come up with an innovative idea, they tend to choose new names and create separate brands, despite the formidable advertising expenses involved. With an attitude of ''if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' companies limit their real money-spinners to cosmetic changes.</p>
        <p>A percentage point of market share is now worth more in many industries than it was 10 or 20 years ago, because the markets for so many consumer goods have become so fragmented as the country has become more culturally diverse, said C. B. Bhattacharya, an associate professor of marketing at Boston University. Global competition from many different brands has intensified, too. ''If you want to protect your share, then that calls for caution,'' Mr. Bhattacharya said.</p>
        <p>AT DaimlerChrysler, wariness of big changes in its minivans is particularly noteworthy, because the company, though the minivan leader, is the third-largest player overall in the American auto market, after G.M. and Ford.</p>
        <p>Usually, said Jag Sheth, a marketing professor at Emory University in Atlanta, companies that are not No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets tend to be the most innovative, because they have less to lose. In fact, Chrysler's overall record is one of the best illustrations of that axiom, Mr. Sheth said.</p>
        <p>But these are prosperous times, and automakers, like companies in many consumer industries, tend to be most cautious when sales are strong. As the current economic expansion gets older, ''there is a natural conservatism,'' said James R. Gregory, the chief executive of Corporate Branding, a brand strategy company in Stamford, Conn. ''People want to hold on to the gains.'' It takes a recession or heavy financial losses to drive many companies to take risks with successful products.</p>
        <p>Both the ground-breaking Taurus sedans and the minivan that Chrysler introduced in late 1995 were designed during the 1991 recession. Chastened by public reaction to that Taurus, Ford redesigned it for the 2000 model year to make it one of the blandest, most nondescript midsize cars -- its plain, rectangular windows replacing the ovals that made the previous version so unusual.</p>
        <p>Yet Chrysler has more to lose if it miscalculates. Financial analysts calculate that minivans contribute as much as one-third of the profits of the Chrysler group, even though they account for less than one-fifth of the vehicles it sells. And minivans are particularly important to the company now, as high gasoline prices could threaten its other big source of profits, Jeep and Dodge Durango sport utility vehicles. While Chrysler expects gasoline prices to fall later this summer, the relatively fuel-efficient minivans could gain in sales at the expense of sport utilities if prices stay high, said James P. Holden, Chrysler's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Daimler acquired Chrysler in 1998, after the design of the new minivans, but the merger produced one windfall for Chrysler: Daimler's Mercedes division had been planning to introduce a luxury minivan closely modeled on the Town &amp; Country, but canceled the project after the deal.</p>
        <p>DESPITE lavishly financed assaults over the years by practically every other large automaker, Chrysler remains king in minivans, with its 42 percent market share. Though that is less than half its peak of 90.5 percent in 1988, Chrysler's dominance in the category still surpasses that of any rival in any other major segment of the American auto market.</p>
        <p>That success has been based on customers like Conrad and Dede Weil, who have bought a new Chrysler minivan every two or three years since 1983 and plan to buy another Town &amp; Country as soon as the latest  design goes on sale next month. ''I put my order in for the next one a year or two ago, before I even knew what it would look like,' said Mr. Weil, a real estate developer in Houston who trusted Chrysler not to make radical changes.</p>
        <p>Until the new minivans go on sale, the best place to see one is in the windowless, tightly guarded design dome at Chrysler's headquarters here. Its circular floor, covered in dark gray carpeting, is wide enough to hold a dozen automobiles for executives' review. Its white, hemispherical ceiling has soft, diffuse lighting  that minimizes glare.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, a new, white long-wheelbase Town &amp; Country was the only vehicle in the room. Mr. McKinnon walked around it, pointing out subtle changes from the previous model. He occasionally crouched, holding out his hands to triangulate, like an artist before a large painting.</p>
        <p>Starting at the front of the vehicle, he gestured toward the hood, an inch higher than on previous models, and the headlights, twice as big and 80 percent brighter. ''It gives it a flush, aggressive look,'' he said proudly.</p>
        <p>Moving to the driver's side, he pointed to the lower edge of the rear side windows, which now tilt upward at a slight angle, instead of being nearly flat. ''It gives it a little more aggressive tilt,'' he said. The wheel wells are also flared out slightly, as on many sport utilities. And the engines on the new minivans have 180 to 230 horsepower, up from 140 to 180.</p>
        <p>But when asked whether Chrysler was trying to imitate the aggressive appearance of sport utilities, Mr. McKinnon grew defensive. ''It was nothing intentional,'' he said, quickly deciding that ''dynamic'' might be a better word than ''aggressive'' to describe the new features.</p>
        <p>General Motors is trying to make some of its minivans, particularly the Pontiac Montana, look more like sport utilities, and the reasons are clear. Minivan sales have doubled since 1990, but sport utility vehicle sales have nearly quadrupled. Pontiac enjoyed immediate success in 1997 by marketing a Montana version of its Trans Sport minivan with television ads showing cowboys riding alongside in scenes similar to those in sport utility ads. Soon, Pontiac eliminated the Trans Sport name and now sells all its minivans as Montanas, trying to elude the ''soccer mom'' image of minivans.</p>
        <p>On the bottom foot or so of the sides of the Montana, Pontiac offers taupe- or charcoal-colored plastic cladding -- a feature commonly used on $40,000 sport utilities to make them seem utilitarian, even if they are seldom driven off-road. But while  Chrysler minivans have long had scuff-resistant plastic cladding, too, it will stay the same color as the rest of the vehicle, making it virtually invisible to anyone not looking for it.</p>
        <p>The reason? Chrysler's market researchers concluded that minivans and sport utilities were really two separate markets. Mr. Holden said the soccer-mom image had been inescapably associated with the minivan ever since the first advertising campaign in 1983, which presented the vehicle as an alternative to the station wagon for families with children. ''We pitched it like that, fairy dust and kids, in the first ads touting it as a 'magic wagon,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>WHILE buyers of sport utility vehicles are mainly concerned with a vehicle's image, minivan buyers do not even put the exterior styling in the top 10 reasons for their purchase, said David Bostwick, Chrysler's director of market research. By an overwhelming margin, he said, minivan buyers focus instead on how functional and flexible the vehicle's interior will be for hauling people and their belongings.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon, circling the Town &amp; Country in the design dome, bridled when told of Mr. Bostwick's comment. The market researchers do not ask the right questions to determine the importance of exterior styling, he said, contending that minivan buyers' overall image of their vehicles is shaped by first impressions -- formed before they ever step inside.</p>
        <p>Walking around the back of the Town &amp; Country, he cheerfully demonstrated the vehicle's most distinctive new feature: a powered rear liftgate. It opens when he pushes the button on a remote control key fob, beeping as it rises to warn anyone nearby. Then Mr. McKinnon stands warily below the liftgate and pushes the button again; the liftgate begins to close automatically but stops instantly when it touches the top of his head and rises again. ''It worked,'' he says, jokingly pretending to be relieved.</p>
        <p>But inside the rear liftgate is one of the most important features that Chrysler left little changed: the third row of seats. The 110-pound row is still designed to be rolled out the back of the vehicle when not needed and stored in the owner's garage. An option this year is for the seat to come in two rollable 55-pound pieces.  But it does not fold down flat into a compartment in the vehicle, like the fold-away third row in the Honda Odyssey, which ranks a distant third in sales but is gaining on Chrysler faster than any other brand.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon wrestles with the Town &amp; Country's third row in an unsuccessful effort to remove it; such features commonly do not work in early prototypes. (The seats are designed to roll out, although the task usually requires two people, as in Chrysler's current minivans.)</p>
        <p>Despite the prototype's difficulty, Chrysler's minivans are the only such vehicles produced by Detroit automakers to be recommended by Consumer Reports magazine, which harshly judges the reliability of most American-made vehicles.</p>
        <p>Thomas G. Elliott, the executive vice president for auto operations in Honda's North American unit, said Odyssey buyers gave higher marks to the fold-away seat than any other feature. G.M.'s Chevrolet Venture,  Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Montana will offer fold-away seats beginning this fall. And Mr. Townsend said Ford was working to develop a fold-away seat for the Windstar as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Ralph A. Sarotte, the general manager of Chrysler's minivan operations, said the company had rejected fold-away seats after finding that the space for folding them down could function as a hollow drum, amplifying road noise and making it difficult for passengers to hear one another. The new Chrysler minivans are much quieter inside than competitors' models because they have traditional rear seats, Mr. Sarotte said.</p>
        <p>Competitors question this compromise between noise and convenience. ''I was floored with the '01 Chrysler, that they didn't touch those seats,'' said Fred J. Schaafsma, a top G.M. vehicle development executive who oversaw minivans until early this summer. ''That was a horrible trade-off.''</p>
        <p>Back in the design dome, Mr. McKinnon moved to the passenger side of the Town &amp; Country and pointed to the front overhang, the distance from the wheels to the front of the bumper. The larger headlights make this overhang look short, he said, but it is actually an inch longer now.</p>
        <p>The ratio of a vehicle's front overhang length to its weight is the main consideration in determining a vehicle's performance in the federal government's crash tests, which involve hurling a vehicle at 35 miles an hour into a concrete wall. Lightweight vehicles with very long hoods tend to do best in the tests, while heavy vehicles with short hoods often allow severe damage to the dummies inside.</p>
        <p>Chrysler officials concede that even with the extra inch, the fairly short overhang on their minivans will likely mean that they receive four stars for frontal crash safety in the government tests, compared with the top rating of five earned by the Windstar, Sienna and Odyssey.</p>
        <p>But Chrysler could not increase the front overhang without lengthening the vehicle, which would have made it harder to park, or moving the front tires back in the vehicle, which likely would have reduced the interior room. Either step would have involved an expensive redesign of the vehicle's underbody, which remains little changed from the previous generation. Either would also have required the replacement of considerable factory equipment, which would have caused a costly delay before the first production of the new models.</p>
        <p>Chrysler chose a modest increase in the front overhang. ''To improve that rating, you have to put more body in front of the wheels,'' Mr. Rinschler said. ''You make the vehicle longer, heavier and, to my eyes, less attractive.''</p>
        <p>MR. RINSCHLER and other executives contend that government crash tests are an imperfect measure of how vehicles actually perform in crashes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Chrysler's current minivans, which also have four-star ratings, have slightly below-average death rates for their drivers compared with other minivans, and minivans as a group have a lower death rate for their drivers than any other type of vehicle, according to insurance industry data. But when the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an insurance industry trade group, did its own crash test of the current minivans, it gave them an overall rating of ''marginal'' and found that they permitted ''the likelihood of significant injury to both legs,'' a problem for vehicles with  short front overhangs.</p>
        <p>Ford has heavily advertised the Windstar's five-star rating. Mr. Bostwick questioned whether the difference between four and five stars would influence customers; regulators acknowledge that the difference  is sometimes small. A four-star rating indicates an 11 to 20 percent chance of a life-threatening injury in a crash at 35 miles an hour with a similar vehicle or a fixed object, while a five-star rating means a chance of 10 percent or less.</p>
        <p>''It's not an overwhelming issue -- they're all safe vehicles,'' Mr. Bostwick said. ''Between the four and the five, it's something to talk about, but it's not going to change someone's mind.''</p>
        <p>At the design dome, Mr. McKinnon added up the changes and declared that Chrysler had done what it set out to do: to freshen but not overhaul a vehicle that continues to sell very well. But throughout the process, he said, the company's designers remembered one lesson learned over the years from rivals: ''Competitors would try something to be different, and when they went too far, the customers would walk on them.''</p>
