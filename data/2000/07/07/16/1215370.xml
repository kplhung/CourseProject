        <p>It is, to begin with, a perverse world. Only 1,000, maybe 1,500 women are rich enough, spoiled enough and otherwise bored enough to buy haute couture clothes. And if they are very rich, they don't even bother coming here at all. They send their private planes to have the fitters from the big houses brought to them. You can imagine what this adds to the price of a $50,000 dress trembling with illusion pearls.</p>
        <p>But it is a very specific world nonetheless, its influence and entertainment value extending far beyond the thin women who sit shank to shank along the gold-toned front row. There was Nan Kempner on July 12 at the Yves Saint Laurent show, sitting a few chairs away from Catherine Deneuve and Lauren Bacall, the sort of classy dames who have been called ''broads'' and don't cry about it.</p>

        <p>It is, to begin with, a perverse world. Only 1,000, maybe 1,500 women are rich enough, spoiled enough and otherwise bored enough to buy haute couture clothes. And if they are very rich, they don't even bother coming here at all. They send their private planes to have the fitters from the big houses brought to them. You can imagine what this adds to the price of a $50,000 dress trembling with illusion pearls.</p>
        <p>But it is a very specific world nonetheless, its influence and entertainment value extending far beyond the thin women who sit shank to shank along the gold-toned front row. There was Nan Kempner on July 12 at the Yves Saint Laurent show, sitting a few chairs away from Catherine Deneuve and Lauren Bacall, the sort of classy dames who have been called ''broads'' and don't cry about it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kempner's chin was raised, she leaned forward like an egret in tall grass. Now she saw something her brain told her she couldn't live without -- yes, a coat of toffee-colored wool over a cloque velvet dress -- and her lips formed a word that anyone could read, if one looked: ''Fabulous.''</p>
        <p>And there was Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, who now also presides over Saint Laurent ready-to-wear, scanning the runway, his eyes sucking in every detail like a pair of giant hoses. One can't help feeling that Mr. Ford, despite his own place in fashion history, wants badly to have even a little of the savoir-faire that Mr. Saint Laurent tosses about as lightly as coin.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Mr. Ford called the show, the penultimate of the fall 2000 couture collections, ''perfect.'' And it was, too, in every way, from the loden and charcoal day suits that seemed right for a slow walk in a cold abbey to the coy buttocks-revealing evening dresses that were clearly Mr. Saint Laurent's way of saying to Mr. Ford that he had the younger man beat by a mile in the deluxe sin department.</p>
        <p>But ''perfect,'' it turns out, is not the most interesting thing Mr. Ford had to say about the Saint Laurent show. Rather, it was, ''By the 10th outfit, you're into his world.''</p>
        <p>That world is fading fast, to be sure, but on Wednesday, at 1:20 p.m., when the crowd rose for a genuine ovation, it was as if,  said Kal Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, ''Father Time had woken up.''</p>
        <p>And none too soon, either. This has been a mixed bag of a season. Karl Lagerfeld put on a smart, lively show on July 11, with bouffant-teased models in electric tweeds gliding along a clear plastic platform floated on a local public pool. Oscar de la Renta's show for Balmain on the evening of July 10 had client clothes galore, many of them good, especially a high-waisted black taffeta skirt of the Balenciaga genre with an oddly seductive childish white blouse.</p>
        <p>But Christian Lacroix's collection, which opened with mink and motorcycle leather dyed in improbable Ho-Jo tones of orange and turquoise and ended with the couture equivalent of the everything-on-it bagel -- a gown doused with five different trims -- seemed an exuberant muddle. Yvan Mispelaere, a former Prada designer, who showed his first collection for Louis Feraud on July 11, went astray with nursery prints and other naive gestures that sophisticated couture clients rarely bother with.</p>
        <p>And though Viktor &amp; Rolf's show on July 12 combined conceptual brilliance with David Lean-style visuals -- models drifting through a near-white mist as their clothes jiggled with masses of tiny bells -- it, too, seemed lost.</p>
        <p>So the day belonged to Saint Laurent. There have been a lot of Saint Laurent shows in recent years when nothing clicked and you thought, 'Okay, this is as good as it's going to get.' But the thing one realized the other day was how vast and deep are Mr. Saint Laurent's reserves of creativity compared with those of other, younger designers who blow themselves out early and then spend the next 10 or 15 years splashing around in the same puddle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saint Laurent recalled for an overstimulated audience how fashion can suddenly look new just by giving it a sense of harmony and proportion. He put classic knee-length coats in toffee or petrol-blue tweed over slivers of cloque velvet cocktail dresses in Cognac brown or midnight blue. Vestal robes, as pure as Grecian drapes, came out in warm shades of brown, purple and blue, while an evening jacket of slick, silvery-green feathers tapered over a column of lacquered black velvet.</p>
        <p>It's rare when clothes work on an emotional level -- it makes you see how very little of the effort that goes into making couture seem new or shocking actually produces a tenth of the shock that Mr. Saint Laurent gets by showing a well-cut jumpsuit, or finishing an outfit with a pair of suede gloves. It's also rare for a designer to be able to challenge a younger generation's frank sexual references by slyly referring to his own.</p>
        <p>In fact, if anyone but Mr. Saint Laurent had sent out a model wearing nothing except some baroque pearls and a buttocks-revealing skirt, he would have been dismissed as a flaming old codger. But Mr. Ford, and his chic brothers and sisters, know better than to avert their eyes.</p>
        <p>Aside from giving the season a sense of perspective, Mr. Saint Laurent and Mr. Lagerfeld, who used to see a lot of each other in their younger years, showed how to base a collection on a concept. This sounds like a simple thing to do, but it's surprising how many designers get so taken with an abstract idea that they can barely express it in words, much less in clothes. (This may have snagged Mr. Lacroix, who in his program notes wrote, ''Couture's history, never quite the same nor quite something else, is part of history.'' The clothes were no clearer.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld is the most consistently far-sighted designer in Paris. He reads, he writes, he converses, he jokes, he remembers. And all this flows in a clear train of thought into the clothes he designs. This season, for Chanel he moved away from some of the volume of the last year or so, with narrower shapes, shorter hemlines and sack-back jackets, although some of the perky suits, including one in black wool that wraps ingeniously around the waist, have flaring skirts.</p>
        <p>There were a lot of nubby tweeds (a trend this season) with wide metallic leather belts that were sometimes inset low on the waist of a coat dress or woven into the front of a tweed jacket flecked with the same electric hues. The colors gave the clothes a kind of hot-rod vivacity, especially with the black patent leather and clear vinyl boots Mr. Lagerfeld showed on the runway.</p>
        <p>So the models walked on water. They had muffs of distressed tulle on their shoulders, and their hair was back-combed in the perennial style of Deeda Blair, a longtime Chanel client, and the 1950's model Dovima. There were evening looks in pink and watery blue paillettes. Mr. Lagerfeld also showed tailored tulle, notably a severe, exceptional-looking dress with crisp pleats left to fringe on the ends.</p>
        <p>''It's very Chanel,'' he said, ''but she would never have done a dress like this. That's my job, no?''</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Renta brought to Balmain, and the more than 50 regular clients in the front row alone, a lot more substance than last season. Suits, some in salt-and-pepper tweeds and worn with chaste white blouses or fur tippets, told the story for day. For evening, Mr. de la Renta seemed to have plucked Mr. Lagerfeld's notion from spring of pairing a short jacket with a full New Lookish skirt.</p>
        <p>On the way into the Viktor &amp; Rolf show, someone wondered aloud if it had been sponsored by Philip Morris. Suffice it to say, the thick, water-based mist made for a lot of innocent groping. It seemed an intriguing idea, encrusting ladylike couture clothes with masses of tiny bells, and then inviting people to listen as the models approached like sleighs through a blizzard. The disgruntled bays of the photographers in another part of the room certainly added an unexpected Chekhovian charm.</p>
        <p>But when the model Carmen Kass emerged, and Andre Leon Talley, an editor at large for Vogue, leaned in and asked if her long jingling vest was heavy, which is what everybody wanted to know, Ms. Kass said in a weary voice, ''Yes, it's heavy.'' And that seemed to say it all.</p>
