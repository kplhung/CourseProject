        <p>August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still delightfully long but it is also the month for the Edinburgh International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and theater. Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm, take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor thoroughly spoiled for choice.</p>
        <p>It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost 300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to things like education and health. The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV Bridge.</p>

        <p>August may be the best month of all to visit Edinburgh, the most regal of Scottish cities. Not only are the northern days still delightfully long but it is also the month for the Edinburgh International Festival, a world-renowned feast of music, dance and theater. Most of Edinburgh is given over to the festival, as international companies, including the New York City Ballet, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm, take over theaters and concert halls, leaving the visitor thoroughly spoiled for choice.</p>
        <p>It has been a year since Scotland embarked on a bold democratic experiment, swearing in its first England-free Parliament in almost 300 years and getting to run its own affairs when it comes to things like education and health. The new legislators have yet to move into their custom-made building at Holyrood, but construction can be observed in the Old City, on Edinburgh's south side. When Parliament is in session, the legislators themselves can be seen building Scotland's new political order in their temporary headquarters, near the George IV Bridge.</p>
        <p>One caveat: it is normal, while visiting Edinburgh, to become unduly obsessed with the vicissitudes of Scottish weather. It can be cold; it can be hot; rain is generally lurking somewhere on the horizon. The best course is to plan for the worst, but hope for the best.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>From Aug. 13 to Sept. 2, Edinburgh will feast on the dizzyingly eclectic smorgasbord that is the Edinburgh International Festival. For tickets and a full list of events, call the festival office at (44-131) 473-2000 (www.eif.co.uk) or Globaltickets at (800) 223-6108 in the United States. Tickets can also be purchased at the  Hub, the festival's handsome new headquarters -- a prime spot for eating and shopping, too -- on the Royal Mile in the Old City. Here are some highlights:</p>
        <p>On Sept. 1, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra will be performing Janacek's Sinfonietta and Mahler's ''Das Lied von der Erde,'' a lyrical meditation on death and nature. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at Usher Hall on Lothian Road. Tickets from $7.50 to $58.50 (calculated at $1.50 to the pound).</p>
        <p>The pianist Christian Zacharias will direct and accompany the Scottish Chamber Orchestra in a rendering of the complete cycle of Mozart's piano concertos, over seven nights between Aug. 14 and 27 at Usher Hall. Tickets $7.50 to $46.50.</p>
        <p>Another of the festival's delights is seeing a play in a foreign language. This year's possibilities include a German ''Hamlet'' and a Spanish play called ''One thousand five hundred meters above the level of Jack,'' about a deep-sea diver teetering on the edge of madness. All have English supertitles. On various dates; tickets from $9 to $33.75.</p>
        <p>The Netherlands Dance Theater -- really three companies in one, with each made up of dancers at different points in their careers -- is presenting a program of bold, sexy dancing over five nights, from Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. And on Aug. 30 and 31, dancers from NDT1, the main company, will dance to music played by the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, with Sir Charles Mackerras conducting. Performances are at 7:30 p.m. at various sites; tickets, $7.50 to $55.50.</p>
        <p>There also is the well-known but much less formalized Edinburgh Fringe Festival, which features stand-up comedy, theater, skits, dance, music and mime in halls, parks, clubs and on the streets. Performances run Aug. 6 to 28; (44-131) 226-5138; www.edfringe.com. Admission to some performances is free; tickets range up to $22.50.</p>
        <p>From Aug. 4 to 26, Edinburgh is also celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, an extravaganza of pipes and drums and well-turned calves peeking out from beneath kilts. It takes place at night, beside Edinburgh Castle, which adds to the pageantry; (44-131) 225-1188, www.edintattoo.co.uk. Shows are Monday to Friday at 9 p.m., and Saturday at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. Tickets: $12.75 to $36.75.</p>
        <p>Devoted to Dadaists and Surrealists like Ernst, Magritte and Man Ray, the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road, is a beautifully organized new museum in a grand, neo-Classical former orphanage in north Edinburgh. An exhibition from Saturday through Oct. 1 will feature Salvador Dali. Open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 2 to 5 p.m.; (44-131) 624-6200. The regular collection is free; the Dali exhibition is $6.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>If the day is spectacularly sunny (it happens sometimes), celebrate at the Royal Botanic Garden, 70 acres of beautiful gardens and greenhouses that feature a display of herbaceous borders during August. Tucked amid all the greenery are a cafe and shop. The Garden, 20A Inverleith Row, (44-131) 552-7171, is open daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (6 p.m. in September). Free admission.</p>
        <p>The former royal yacht Britannia  is docked on Ocean Drive in Leith, and you can pay $11.55 ($8.95 ages 60 and older, $5.60 ages 5 to 17) to stride its four decks in a monarchical manner. Open 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Thursday, and until 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday; (44-131) 555-5566. Reservations are advised.</p>
        <p>It cost hundreds of millions of dollars less than the Millennium Dome in Greenwich, but Dynamic Earth, a new museum not far from the royal Palace of Holyroodhouse, is far more successful. This minidome offers nothing less than the story of Earth in all its diversity. Visitors can experience icebergs, volcanoes and tropical rain forests, among other things, in 11 galleries with stunning special effects. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer, with last entry at 4:45. Information: (44-131) 550-7800; admission is $10.40, $5.90 ages 5 to 15.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Scotland, on Chambers Street, presents a whirlwind tour of Scottish history. Attractions include an authentic 18th-century guillotine. The top floor is a crazy quilt of objects -- from golf balls and hairdryers to a Saab convertible to the Queen song ''Bohemian Rhapsody'' -- that ordinary Scots have identified as essential to their very being. Open daily. Admission (which also gets you into the Royal Museum next door) is $4.50, $2.25 for students and those 60 and older. Free for people under 19, and on Tuesdays after 4:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Rooms are scarce during the festival. For 11th-hour help, try www .edinburgh.org, which has a listing of hotels, or (44-131) 473-3800. For rooms in private homes at festival time, call (44-131) 225-1101.</p>
        <p>Just 10 minutes by car from the center of town and easily reachable by bus, the Malmaison stands in modern splendor in Leith, a lively and much-revived waterfront neighborhood east of central Edinburgh. The hotel, one in an admired British chain, is decorated in cool earth tones, with clean lines and geometric motifs. The 60 rooms include five suites. Doubles from $165, with tax. One Tower Place, Leith; (44-131) 468-5000, fax (44-131) 468-5002.</p>
        <p>The recently refurbished Edinburgh Royal Circus Hotel, 19-21 Royal Circus, in a handsome Georgian building in central Edinburgh, offers 30 rooms, friendly service, garden views and easy access to major attractions. Doubles are $144, tax and breakfast included; (44-131) 220-5000, fax (44-131) 220-2020.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Ashlyn Guest House, 42 Inverleith Row near the Botanic Garden, is one of scores of small family-run hotels that offer all the comforts of someone else's home at reasonable prices. Five of the eight bedrooms have private baths. No smoking. Doubles start at $45 a person, breakfast included. Telephone and fax (44-131) 552-2954.</p>
        <p>The Borthwick Guest House, at 23 Mayfield Gardens on the city's south side, offers 11 bedrooms, all with private baths. Doubles from $45 per person, breakfast included; (44-131) 667-8475, fax (44-131) 667-6763.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Bonham, 35 Drumsleugh Gardens, Edinburgh's newest hip hotel, epitomizes the city's seemingly effortless ability to combine the old and the new. Constructed from three adjoining town houses, the hotel has a stately Victorian facade that belies a thoroughly modern interior, with brash contemporary furniture and modern art. There are 48 rooms; doubles from $247.50, with tax and breakfast. If the Bonham is full, its owners will gladly recommend their other two hotels, the Howard and Channings, which are cozy and Old World; (800) 323-5463 from the United States, fax (44-131) 226-6080.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Tucked away off the Royal Mile, Dubh Prais, 123B High Street, offers Scottish dishes lovingly prepared with traditional recipes. Try collops in the pan, steak medallions in a port-and-pickled-walnut sauce; for dessert, there's atholl brose parfait, an unusually tasty ice cream made with toasted oatmeal, honey and Drambuie. A typical dinner for two, plus wine, costs about $90. Reservations are essential -- there are only nine tables; (44-131) 557-5732.</p>
        <p>The Tower, at the top of the Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street, is one of Edinburgh's hottest new restaurants. Appetizers include sauteed mushrooms with spinach, poached egg and toasted brioche; for the main course, portions of steak and roast beef come in three sizes: 8, 12, and 16 ounces. Dinner for two, with wine, generally comes to about $150. A two-course pre-theater dinner for $18 is available from 4 to 6 p.m.; (44-131) 225-3003.</p>
        <p>Most of Scotland's art galleries and museums feature smart cafes with tasty dishes. One that stands out is Cafe Newton in the Dean Gallery, 73 Belford Road. It is open the same hours as the gallery and offers a small selection of light entrees, like smoked salmon with creme fraiche, and an eggplant, feta, pesto and olive sandwich on a choice of bread. A sculpture of Isaac Newton looks down from the center of the room. Sandwiches average $6.35; daily hot specials range from $6.75 to $8.25; brownies and other treats cost from $1.20 to $4.35; no alcohol served.</p>
        <p>Tucked into a corner of Hunter Square, not far from the bustle of the Royal Mile, Bann's vegetarian cafe provides healthful food. At dinner, appetizers include Thai phyllo parcels with stir-fried vegetables on wilted bok choy, with a sweet sesame-seed oil dressing; main courses include tarte tatin made of layers of roasted sweet pepper, zucchini and cheddar cheese, and an all-vegetable haggis -- no animal innards to speak of. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $60. Open daily 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.; (44-131) 226-1112.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, George Street has overtaken the increasingly tacky Princes Street nearby as the city's choice shopping and eating street. One of the nicest restaurants here is the Dome, in a vast, high-ceilinged building that used to be a mortuary, then a bank. At the outside Garden Cafe, enjoy pizza and pasta (weather permitting) for about $24 for two, wine included; in the Grill Room, expect to pay from $60 to $75 for two, including wine, at dinner for dishes that include pheasant and apricot terrine with red currant dressing. They can both be found under one dome at 14 George Street; (44-131) 624-8624.</p>
