        <p>With the bars, restaurants and streets of downtown Madrid bustling with life into the early hours of the morning, it may be hard to sense danger. But the city's pickpockets, muggers and scam artists are skilled at choosing their victims, and tourists are their preferred targets. Increasingly, city officials and foreign embassies are urging tourists to beware in Madrid. Petty crime is on the rise. Still more worrisome, the use of violence by muggers -- albeit brandishing knives, not guns -- is becoming more common.</p>
        <p>Some cons are old hat, such as squirting mustard on the shirt of a passer-by or dropping keys at a tourist's feet or simply asking directions -- any distraction while a pickpocket goes to work. Others are more original: criminals may surreptitiously slash a rental car's tires with razors attached to their shoes, then step forward to offer help in changing the tire -- and, while the trunk is open, make off with luggage (a variation of this involves so-called ''highway pirates'' who persuade tourists to halt by pointing to a supposedly flat tire).</p>

        <p>With the bars, restaurants and streets of downtown Madrid bustling with life into the early hours of the morning, it may be hard to sense danger. But the city's pickpockets, muggers and scam artists are skilled at choosing their victims, and tourists are their preferred targets. Increasingly, city officials and foreign embassies are urging tourists to beware in Madrid. Petty crime is on the rise. Still more worrisome, the use of violence by muggers -- albeit brandishing knives, not guns -- is becoming more common.</p>
        <p>Some cons are old hat, such as squirting mustard on the shirt of a passer-by or dropping keys at a tourist's feet or simply asking directions -- any distraction while a pickpocket goes to work. Others are more original: criminals may surreptitiously slash a rental car's tires with razors attached to their shoes, then step forward to offer help in changing the tire -- and, while the trunk is open, make off with luggage (a variation of this involves so-called ''highway pirates'' who persuade tourists to halt by pointing to a supposedly flat tire).</p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, tourists arriving at airports, railroad stations or bus terminals are advised to watch their bags with special care, not to be wooed into conversation with strangers and not to take ''pirate'' cabs. Once in Madrid proper, it's a good idea to keep your passport, credit cards, traveler's checks and any large amounts of cash in the hotel safe. (The Japanese Embassy warns that there is a flourishing local market for stolen Japanese passports.)</p>
        <p>Still, if it were just a question of avoiding rough neighborhoods, things would be simple. But petty criminals logically operate where tourists hang out, that is, in the most attractive and lively parts of the city, such as the Plaza Mayor, the Plaza de Santa Ana, the Plaza de Espana, the area around the Prado Museum and the Retiro Park. The answer is to take some minimal precautions, such as keeping away from the Puerta del Sol, a square now favored by drug dealers, or taking a taxi back to the hotel after enjoying a late show in a flamenco bar, or (can this repeated enough?) not carrying anything too valuable.</p>
