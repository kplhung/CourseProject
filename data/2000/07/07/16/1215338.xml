        <p>Prodigy Communications Corporation, the nation's third-largest Internet service provider, is leaving White Plains for Houston, but not before possibly having to return some economic incentive benefits to Westchester County.</p>
        <p>''Our attorneys are talking to their attorneys,'' said Teri Waivada, executive director of the county's Industrial Development Agency. ''There are possible penalties based on the number of jobs that will be lost and when they will be lost.''</p>
        <p>Mary Matalobos, a spokeswoman for the online company, said it is too soon to discuss the matter. ''But Prodigy does intend to finalize any agreements we have recorded of having entered into with any legislative or taxing authorities in the local area,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Prodigy has occupied its 82,000-square-foot corporate headquarters at 44 South Broadway in White Plains since 1997. That is when it was promised about $400,000 in certain sales tax abatements to stay in Westchester and retain 400 jobs in the county, Ms. Waivada said.</p>
        <p>The company also has office space in Yorktown Heights. It said the move, set for early next year, is necessary to ''better leverage Prodigy's alliance'' with Texas-based SBC Communications.</p>
