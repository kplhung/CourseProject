        <p>TUPPERWARE, not software. Maybe that should be my new motto as I consider joining the ranks of those who sell polyethylene fridgeware for a living.</p>
        <p>Think about it. Selling Tupperware has an awful lot in common with the new-economy jobs that young adults crave. You can work any time you want and as much as you want. The biggest rewards go to those who are the most immersed, the most passionate, the most relentless. No soul-deadening shirt-and-tie office environment here: your workplace is the friendliest, funkiest available -- your own home. No health insurance, pension plans or other young-people-don't-need-'em benefits to bite into the paycheck -- just plenty of incentive-based compensation, plus perks like free cars (a Jeep Cherokee! a Dodge Caravan!) and vacations (Myrtle Beach! Las Vegas!) for hitting goals. They could call it www.tupperware.com.</p>

        <p>TUPPERWARE, not software. Maybe that should be my new motto as I consider joining the ranks of those who sell polyethylene fridgeware for a living.</p>
        <p>Think about it. Selling Tupperware has an awful lot in common with the new-economy jobs that young adults crave. You can work any time you want and as much as you want. The biggest rewards go to those who are the most immersed, the most passionate, the most relentless. No soul-deadening shirt-and-tie office environment here: your workplace is the friendliest, funkiest available -- your own home. No health insurance, pension plans or other young-people-don't-need-'em benefits to bite into the paycheck -- just plenty of incentive-based compensation, plus perks like free cars (a Jeep Cherokee! a Dodge Caravan!) and vacations (Myrtle Beach! Las Vegas!) for hitting goals. They could call it www.tupperware.com.</p>
        <p>In fact, they do. A year-old Web site by that name supplies the company's million-strong worldwide army of consultants with product information and stories of sales success. American customers can shop on the site, or, with a consultant's referral, at www.my.tupperware.com, a newer site that lets consultants customize their own home pages. Customers order online, and the consultant gets a commission.</p>
        <p>Forget hausfraus in housecoats. Tupperware, Avon, Amway and other direct marketers have figured out that the way to cater to younger, Web-savvy consumers is to recruit younger, Web-savvy sales reps.</p>
        <p>Clearly, a lot has changed in the 55 years since the first Tupperware snap-top container appeared. These days, more and more of the company's 75,000 American consultants are college-educated, said Christine Hanneman, a vice president of the Tupperware Corporation in Orlando, Fla. ''We're looking for people to work their way up,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Colleen Layne, 24, has been selling Tupperware for nearly five years and says she now earns more than  $5,000 a month working 20-hour weeks. Ms. Layne got started as a high school senior in Garden City, Mich., while her friends were baby-sitting or shoveling French fries. Cool it wasn't -- ''no one was into it,'' she remembered -- but she stuck with it, even throwing Tupperware parties in her college dorm room. She is now a senior executive manager overseeing 20 consultants, driving the Dodge minivan that she earned as an incentive.</p>
        <p>''I don't plan on ever leaving,'' she said by cell phone while on a vacation. ''It's too much fun.''</p>
        <p>THE story is similar at Avon Products, the doorbell-ringing cosmetics concern. Those doorbells have gone through considerable modifications since 1886, when a few pioneers sold their first lip rouge.</p>
        <p>The company has been online since 1997 and in September plans to revamp the site to give sales representatives their own Web addresses. Reps who need them can lease a computer and get Internet access cheaply through the company. At the end of this month, Avon will be starting a '''beauty advisor'' training program for the women -- and some, but not many, men -- who want to become certified experts in loveliness.</p>
        <p>''We're offering career opportunities that attract young people,'' said Laura Castellano, a spokeswoman for Avon in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>If that's not enough to make you quit your day job, the DeVos and Van Andel families, who brought Amway  into the world, created quixtar.com last fall. It is intended to attract young entrepreneurs who want to sell Amway and other products online instead of door to door.</p>
        <p>''Most Web e-tailers are trying to establish their brand and get customers, as we watch a lot of them struggle,'' said John Parker, vice president for sales and marketing at Quixtar, which like Amway is based in Grand Rapids, Mich. ''We're not a typical dot-com because of the entrepreneurial opportunities, and we're not a typical direct-selling company because we have the dot-com piece. We're creating a new niche.''</p>
        <p>Is it working? A Quixtar spokesman said the half-million or so people who have signed up so far are, on average, about 10 years younger than those joining Amway lately.</p>
        <p>It's too soon to know if newfangled multilevel marketing systems will have staying power, or if their young recruits will become jaded with the rah-rah tactics and move on to other businesses or their own start-ups.</p>
        <p>If they do get fed up with Avon or Amway, I have a tip for them. It's just one word: plastics.</p>
