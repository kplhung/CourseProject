        <p>Stung by meager defense orders from an impoverished army at home, Russia's military industrial establishment is engaged in a major effort to increase arms sales to Asia, the Middle East and Africa and is expanding its share of the lucrative global arms market.</p>
        <p>The United States and western Europe dominate the international weapons bazaar. But this week, on a once-secret test range in the Ural mountains, the men who fashioned the formidable arsenal that once made NATO anxious and was paraded with pride by the Kremlin each Nov. 7 showed that they could attract plenty of customers -- and had plenty to sell, too.</p>
        <p>Defense officials from India and China -- Russia's major customers for weapons -- Kuwait, North Korea, South Korea and dozens of other nations watched attentively as a T-90 tank, one of Russia's newest weapons, sent a laser-guided missile streaking toward a target more than two miles away. South Korean officials kept a watchful eye on any weapons that piqued North Korean interest.</p>
        <p>Baton-twirling majorettes paraded along the range's esplanade as Russian officials toasted their guests from vodka bottles bearing the imprint of a Russian tank. And Mikhail Kalashnikov, the 80-year-old designer of the AK-47, strolled through the crowd, posing for pictures.</p>
        <p>Executives from General Dynamics, the American defense contractor, were also there, scrutinizing the Russian tanks. Russian officials say that General Dynamics is discussing the purchase of a revolutionary Russian system to protect tanks from missile and grenade attacks.</p>
        <p>''Exports are the most important thing for us because they bring in real money,'' said Viktor A. Yamov, the chief of advertising for Uralvagonzavod, manufacturer of the T-90 tank. ''We don't see much real money from the Russian Army.''</p>
        <p>There are two ways to calculate arms sales: agreements made and actual deliveries. In terms of deliveries last year, the real money from the rest of the world totaled $2.8 billion, putting Russia fourth, behind the United States, France and Britain, in weapons sales. Russian weapons accounted for 6 percent of all arms delivered -- compared with the United States' 49 percent -- but Terence Taylor, assistant director of the Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said that Russia is now expanding that share toward 10 percent.</p>
        <p>During Soviet times, the military sector had first claim on resources here and defense plants churned out thousands of tanks, artillery pieces and air defense missiles. Weapons production was surrounded by intense secrecy, and, although the Soviets dispatched tons of weaponry to friendly nations, a fair to sell arms to the world was unthinkable.</p>
        <p>With the Soviet collapse, Russia's defense complex plunged into depression. Defense orders dried up. Debts to suppliers and utilities mounted. Conversion to civilian production remained largely a pipe dream. Exports became a vital, if tenuous, lifeline.</p>
        <p>''At this point, the Russian armed forces are buying very little,'' Mr. Taylor said in a telephone interview. ''Virtually all of the production is going for export.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yamov's factory, a sprawling complex near this test range that used to employ 45,000 people, is a case in point. It produced all of the Soviet tanks, from the legendary T-34 of World War II to its T-72, operating under the cover story that it turned out mere railroad cars. Now, it lives for exports.</p>
        <p>Russia is on the verge of announcing a major arms deal with India under which New Delhi would purchase about 300 T-90 tanks. One hundred of them would be manufactured at the Uralvagonzavod plant, with some 200 assembled in India. Russian press reports estimate the deal is worth some $700 million.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Russian Army has just two T-90 tanks in the European part of its territory, according to data Moscow supplied in January under the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe.</p>
        <p>And despite President Vladimir V. Putin's pledge to boost weapons procurement, the Russian Army is only scheduled to receive 30 T-90 tanks this year. That is a small fraction of the 350 new tanks that Col. Gen.  Anatoly Sitnov, the weapons chief for the Russian armed forces, says are needed each year.</p>
        <p>This year, the Russian Air Force is purchasing just 12 SU-30 fighter and attack planes, although with exports in mind, about 50 are being produced. In 1998, the air force did not acquire a single new fighter.</p>
        <p>While exports are vital to Russia's military complex, competition is stiff. Western nations can offer more generous financing, have longstanding customers, and offer better maintenance and spare parts service after sale. And former Soviet states like Ukraine, which also inherited Soviet defense plants, compete for orders that Russia covets.</p>
        <p>The fact that the Russian military has fielded so few new weapons does not help either; many customers like to buy only systems that have been put to the test.</p>
        <p>Still, the Russians have some advantages. Low labor costs make their weapons cheaper than those of Western counterparts. They also have a reputation for producing high-quality armored systems, anti-tactical missile systems and artillery.</p>
        <p>Russia's weapons trade has consequences for its foreign policy, according to some experts here. The defense establishment is still dominated by men reared in cold war enmity; the competition for sales has reinforced the notion that America is an unfriendly rival whose success comes at Russia's expense, particularly since NATO has expanded its membership and hence its arms clientele into the former Soviet bastion of Central Europe.</p>
        <p>''It makes the defense establishment even more anti-American,'' said Dmitri V. Trenin, the deputy director of the Moscow Carnegie Center. ''This is not just the abstract notion of competition. It is a confrontation over money.''</p>
        <p>The vast majority of Russia's arms exports go to two nations: China and India. Their primary interest is in acquiring the means to make weapons, not just to buy the weapons systems themselves, a development that contributes to the spread of advanced military technology.</p>
        <p>Russia's major deals with China include a licensing agreement permitting Beijing to co-produce SU-27 aircraft, and the sale of two destroyers. In addition to the pending tank contract with India, another deal under discussion would provide the Indians with the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov and the MIG-29 planes that would be on it.</p>
        <p>Measured in terms of agreements, Russia accounted for 40 percent of weapons sales to Asia between 1995 and 1998, according to Richard F. Grimmett of the Congressional Research Service in Washington.</p>
        <p>''The Russians are highly dependent on arms contracts with those two countries,'' Mr. Grimmett said. ''China and India have tremendous leverage in terms of getting the advanced equipment they are seeking.''</p>
        <p>With a younger, more dynamic president now in the Kremlin and sales at stake, the Russians appeared to go all out to make this week's arms fair in the Urals -- the second annual event here -- a prestigious occasion. Mr. Putin himself showed up.</p>
        <p>And there were several new pieces of weaponry. One notable new item was a tank support vehicle, which has a crew of five. It has the protection of a tank but is outfitted with a unique set of weapons, including grenade launchers, a 30-millimeter cannon and four antitank missiles. The Russians appear to have designed the weapon with an insurgency like the one in Chechnya in mind, but it was a big hit with the Chinese, who clustered around it.</p>
        <p>Another novel system that attracted attention was Nakidka, basically a tarpaulin that is draped over equipment to foil weapons guided by radar and heat-seeking devices that create images from the heat of objects.</p>
        <p>Foreign military officials also seemed impressed by the Iskander surface-to-surface missile, which was shown for the first time, and the S-300 system, which is designed to shoot down Scud-type missiles.</p>
        <p>One of the hits of the arms fair were the T-80 and T-90 jumping tanks, which zoomed up a ramp and leaped through the air.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of foreigners who identified themselves only as defense attaches, intelligence experts or trade officials but often declined to give their names, prowled among the exhibits. Many carried sophisticated cameras and snapped detailed pictures of firing mechanisms, artillery tubes and weapons chassis.</p>
        <p>Kuwaiti military officials eagerly talked with the Russians about their tanks. An Iranian delegation wanted to see executives at Uralvagonzavod. Iran has a fleet of T-72 tanks and is interested in upgrades, said Mr. Yamov, the advertising director.</p>
        <p>General Dynamics, for its part, has been exploring the idea of acquiring Russia's Arena system, which uses a radar to detect antitank missiles or grenades and destroys them by firing munitions, according to Aleksandr I. Kobin, the general director of Rosvooruzheniye, the Russian arms sales agency. He indicated that President Putin would have to decide whether the system could be provided to the Americans.</p>
        <p>Officials from the American corporation, based in Falls Church, Va., declined to discuss their interest in Arena, but they were certainly taking a close look at the Russian tanks.</p>
        <p>''No one country has the corner on good ideas,'' said Philip W. Lett, the former program manager for the United States Army's M-1 tank program and a General Dynamics consultant.</p>
        <p>And despite their long alliance with Washington, the South Koreans expressed interest in exploring production with the Russians. As a South Korean defense attache put it, ''Business is business.''</p>
