        <p>After a two-year trial, a six-member jury in a state circuit court in Miami ordered the tobacco industry to pay $145 billion in punitive damages to Florida smokers who have become ill. The award shattered previous records for the size of a punitive damages verdict and a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class-action suit called it a ''day of reckoning'' for Big Tobacco. But spokesmen for the tobacco companies quickly predicted that the sheer size of the award, which they said they could not pay, would make it untenable. Philip Morris Inc. was ordered to pay the largest amount, $73.96 billion; the other defendants were the Lorillard Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Liggett Group Inc. and the industry's defunct Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco Institute.</p>
