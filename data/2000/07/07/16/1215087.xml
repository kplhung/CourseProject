        <p>Kami Youngberg response to Web site questionnaire about racial relations in America notes her black college roommate is taunted by other black students for not conforming</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>My college roommate and best friend is black. She doesn't like hip-hop; she dresses like a hippie and isn't interested in black sororities or the Black Student Union. When she gets cornered by other black students, they call her an Uncle Tom and ask why she wears ''so much makeup.'' I'm tired of people thinking she's strange because they don't think that how she looks matches up to how she acts. What they can't seem to see is that she's a beautiful person.</p>
