        <p>Joe Ruggiero nodded at the two-bit tough guys flickering on the south wall of the DeSalvio Playground. The celluloid gangsters might as well have stepped out of his childhood.</p>
        <p>''There were guys like that everywhere,'' he said. ''The so-called people in charge, they didn't do anything for the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruggiero knows that there was a time when mouthing off like that in Little Italy could have gotten him a broken arm or a bullet in the head. But these days, he is more likely to be bruised by tourists jostling for cannoli. For a taste of the old neighborhood, he had to walk over to the playground at Spring and Mulberry Streets to watch films like ''Mean Streets,'' the 1973 Martin Scorsese opus in which Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro play small-time wiseguys in Little Italy.</p>
        <p>It showed on Friday night, the fifth screening this year in the free Open Cine film series started in 1996 by Luca Pizzaroni. The movies run on most Friday nights throughout the summer. Mr. Pizzaroni, a young filmmaker from Rome, had set out to recreate the open-air cinemas so popular in Italian cities. He usually shows Italian films like ''Il Postino,'' with exceptions like the work of Mr. Scorsese, who grew up in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>People find out about the screenings through fliers posted on the playground fence or Mr. Pizzaroni's Web site, www.nyopencine.com. Most who go are cinephiles or Italian-Americans from around the corner. The best-attended screening this summer, ''La Dolce Vita,'' drew 200 people.</p>
        <p>But on Friday, the night got off to a slow start. Kids were playing on the basketball court and slides well past 8:30. A friend who was supposed to bring chairs didn't show up, so the two dozen people in the audience plopped down on flattened cardboard boxes. Mr. Pizzaroni set his 16-millimeter projector on a wooden ladder and ran an extension cord into the base of a lamppost.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to blow up one of these days,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But soon enough, a beam of light poured from the projector, and the Ronettes' ''Be My Baby'' boomed during the opening credits. Mr. Pizzaroni's friends had brought the speakers, borrowed the ladder from a firehouse, paid for the film rental and printed the fliers. His supporters were here, even if his e-mail invitation to Mr. Scorsese remained unanswered.</p>
        <p>The projector was old, and the picture kept going in and out of focus. But those in the audience who had grown up in Little Italy watched the movie with smiles. Mr. Ruggiero, whose family emigrated from southern Italy in 1963, told one spectator that while working in a bakery he had sold bread to the film crew for a hallway scene. (Most of the film was made in Los Angeles, but parts were shot in New York.)</p>
        <p>When the film first opened at the Fifth Avenue Cinema, now defunct, Mr. Ruggiero walked into the theater and saw half the neighborhood there. ''See, those guys used to live right down the block,'' he said, pointing to two extras on the screen. ''I don't know their names, but they must have been friends of the director.''</p>
        <p>One audience member, dressed sharply in a black suit and narrow-brim hat, squinted at the screen. His name was Frank Huaquilino, but everyone called him Butch the Hat. He had lived his entire 54 years in the neighborhood, he said, and once ran with an Italian gang that brawled with Jewish, Puerto Rican and Chinese gangs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scorsese had cast him in small roles in several movies, he said, and he was acting in a film Mr. Pizzaroni was making. He told people of the days when Mr. De Niro hung out on a bench in the DeSalvio Playground and talked about getting into acting.</p>
        <p>He waved at the screen as it showed a drunken man stumbling around a bar and a hoodlum pulling a gun on him.</p>
        <p>''See where he gets killed,'' Butch said to Mr. Pizzaroni and his friends. ''That really happened. It was in the pocketbook store right down the block. That was a social club in 1968. A guy was carrying a gun and acting cocky, and those days when you carried a gun, you had a problem. He was a nice kid, but what can you do?''</p>
        <p>Butch's rapt audience leaned closer. He pointed to Mulberry Street. ''That's where it happened,'' he said. ''Right there, during the Feast of St. Gennaro.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Ruggiero, the feast is a thing of the past. These days, it is no different from any other street festival in the city, he said to Sam Rohn, one of Mr. Pizzaroni's friends. It has gone the way of everything else in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I always thought they should have kept this place the way it was,'' he said. ''I don't want to sound nationalistic, but they should have done it for history's sake.''</p>
        <p>''But the Italians assimilated,'' Mr. Rohn said. ''That's the way of all immigrants here.''</p>
        <p>''That's true,'' Mr. Ruggiero said. ''But if there were cultural institutions like museums and good schools, people would have stayed here.''</p>
        <p>His own parents moved out to Long Island years ago. These days, he said, there is too much noise, too much garbage. He shook his head and stared up at the screen. A woman was walking into her apartment building carrying groceries, a baguette sticking out of a sack.</p>
        <p>''That's the bread,'' Mr. Ruggiero said. ''I'll never forget that part.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pizzaroni lit a cigarette and glanced at the audience. It had dwindled to a dozen people. No matter. The movie would end soon. It ended in blood, he said with a grin. Lots of it.</p>
        <p>On the screen, Mr. De Niro leaned over the counter of a bar and pointed his gun at a gangster.</p>
        <p>''This scene is so true,'' Mr. Ruggiero said. ''If you went and pulled a pistol on a gangster, it didn't matter who they were, you were saying they were nothing.''</p>
        <p>''It's a tough movie,'' Mr. Pizzaroni said, ''with tough guys.''</p>
        <p>''It could have been tougher,'' Mr. Ruggiero said, ''if they had picked the right guys.''</p>
