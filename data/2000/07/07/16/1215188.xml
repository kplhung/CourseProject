        <p>DEBRA HLADKY can grill a steak with the best of them, but it's this talented chef's seafood specials that make Ted Milan more than just another steakhouse. Witness the perfectly turned out Chilean sea bass set over creamy coconut jasmine rice surrounded by a pool of red curry sauce with a black bean-mango salsa. Memorable.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hladky earned her stripes in the Polo Grill at the Garden City Hotel when Richard Allen was the executive chef there. She went on to be chef de cuisine under Michael Meehan at Tupelo Honey in Sea Cliff and worked as a saucier at Lutece in Manhattan. All this experience shows in the exciting dishes coming from her kitchen.</p>

        <p>Ms. Hladky earned her stripes in the Polo Grill at the Garden City Hotel when Richard Allen was the executive chef there. She went on to be chef de cuisine under Michael Meehan at Tupelo Honey in Sea Cliff and worked as a saucier at Lutece in Manhattan. All this experience shows in the exciting dishes coming from her kitchen.</p>
        <p>Ted Milan Steak House is a friendly, aim-to-please storefront on Park Avenue in Long Beach. French doors open up in fine weather and the good times spill out to sidewalk tables.</p>
        <p>Inside, the room is attractive, with an eye-catching sepia mural of the seaside at Long Beach, circa 1900.  Another wall is host to 10 large gilt-framed mirrors. At the rear is a cozy nook with a table for two set beneath a fireplace crowned with candles. The ceiling is pressed tin, the floor tile. All these hard surfaces add up to a lovely look but, when the restaurant is full, the noise level spirals to an ear-shattering cacophony, making table conversation impossible. We strained to hear a friend who has a voice that usually can be heard all the way to Times Square.</p>
        <p>Still, Ted Milan Steak House has an all-embracing charm. The tone is set by the owners who extend a warm welcome to regulars and first-timers alike. One evening, there was no record of our reservation. The amiable restaurateurs assumed the mistake was theirs, apologized profusely and quickly juggled tables so that we were seated in record time.</p>
        <p>The rest of the staff is just as nice, but service is not sharp. Those delivering dishes haven't a clue as to who ordered them. Water glasses are kept full, but refills on bread are not automatic and are slow in arriving even when requested.</p>
        <p>Prices here are about average for quality Long Island steakhouses. The top steak goes for $29.95; the porterhouse for two is $56.95. But unlike most steakhouses, diners get a break, for a vegetable of the day (very crisp haricots verts, peapods and baby carrots) is included in the price. As is a worthy, not-an-afterthought salad: a platter of mixed greens in a balsamic vinaigrette with grape tomatoes nestled in endive leaves and a clump of julienne carrots on top.</p>
        <p>Although no other starter is really needed, there are some very good ones, especially among the specials. Tops was a crisp soft-shell crab mated with a jicama-red onion slaw, a slightly spicy red pepper beurre blanc and a soothing corn flan. Other specials to listen for are the tasty crabmeat-stuffed clams, the seared diver scallops paired with wasabi mashed potatoes and a thatch of frizzled leeks, and a grilled shrimp-mango salad with a centerpiece of mixed greens.</p>
        <p>From the menu, the grilled portobello salad with sun-dried tomatoes and roasted peppers came up aces, but the Caesar was ordinary. Seared sesame-crusted tuna with wasabi sauce and curry oil is a good menu pick, but the shrimp cocktail, a steakhouse standby, was marred by slightly mushy crustaceans.</p>
        <p>Steak, of course, is the thing to order at entree time, but that sea bass special is very tempting, as is the beautifully grilled salmon enhanced by horseradish mashed potatoes and a dill-lime aioli. Of the meats, the garlic rib-eye is the one I'd return for. The steak had a great crust, juicy meat and was covered with two-dozen cloves of roasted garlic. (Yes, I counted and devoured all of them.) There were no complaints either about the prime, aged boneless shell steak, T-bone or porterhouse for two.</p>
        <p>Just as impressive were the huge, succulent lamb chops precisely cooked to order and the triple-thick pork chop that was juicy and made even more appealing by an apple-raisin sauce.</p>
        <p>All the side dishes pass muster, with the sauteed onions (harboring a few more cloves of that delicious roasted garlic) taking first place.</p>
        <p>A creme brulee with a burned top was the only dessert letdown. Uppers include a molten chocolate cake with fresh strawberries, a truly decadent chocolate decadence cake, a creamy mocha hazelnut cheesecake and a summer fruit tart starring mango, a coconut custard and a blackberry coulis.</p>
        <p>Ted Milan Steak House  36 East Park Avenue, Long Beach (516) 670-0007.</p>
