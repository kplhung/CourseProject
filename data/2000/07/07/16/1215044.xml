        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In David M. Kennedy's rather positive review of my ''MacArthur's War'' (July 2), I am characterized as ''a mightily disillusioned Korean War veteran.'' May I qualify that? I felt, even when over there, that it was a necessary war and that we had to draw the line against Communist aggression. And we did roll the aggressors back across the 38th parallel, from which they had begun. My disillusion was with the appalling military leadership, beginning at the top with the imperious MacArthur -- mostly an old-boy network of incompetent or burned-out field generals -- and with the timid leadership (and opposition) at home, civilian and military alike, which was intimidated by MacArthur's mystique.</p>

        <p>Some of the high brass in Korea lasted even into the efficient Matthew Ridgway's post-Mac command. He couldn't -- or didn't -- fire everybody. One of our well-forgotten generals was even kidnapped, embarrassingly, by prisoners of war in a P.O.W. camp we didn't run any better than we did the war.</p>
