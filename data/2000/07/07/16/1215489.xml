        <p>In a case that has stoked fears about academic freedom in this former British colony, a prominent pollster said on Friday he had been warned by the head of Hong Kong University not to publish surveys critical of the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa.</p>

        <p>In a case that has stoked fears about academic freedom in this former British colony, a prominent pollster said on Friday he had been warned by the head of Hong Kong University not to publish surveys critical of the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa.</p>
        <p>The pollster, Robert Chung, said the university's vice chancellor, Cheng Yiu-chung, told him through a deputy that the university would ''dry up'' the financial support for his work if he did not stop conducting polls on the popularity of Mr. Tung or the postcolonial government.</p>
        <p>''I felt it was a very clear message,'' said Dr. Chung, at an emotional news conference in which he broke down twice.</p>
        <p>Dr. Chung's disclosure capped a week of bitter accusations and denials that began on July 7, when he wrote a column for the South China Morning Post describing how he was pressured.</p>
        <p>''More than once, I was given a clear message from Mr. Tung via a special channel that my polling activities were not welcomed,'' he wrote. ''Mr. Tung did not like me polling his popularity, or the government's credibility.''</p>
        <p>A government spokesman, Stephen Lam, said today that neither Mr. Tung nor anybody on his staff had instructed the university to stop polling.</p>
        <p>With Dr. Chung's decision to name names, a personal dispute has escalated into a furious debate over whether Hong Kong is stifling academic freedom. Such questions have been raised about press freedom and the legal system since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. But its eight publicly funded universities have been generally untouched by political pressure.</p>
        <p>''This is potentially more serious than those other disputes because Hong Kong's future depends on the free flow of information,'' said Michael DeGolyer, a professor at Baptist University who also conducts polls about the government. ''If Hong Kong gains a reputation for limiting or restricting its news flow, any hope of making this the financial center of Asia are gone.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Chung's surveys have revealed a marked deterioration in the popularity of Mr. Tung -- a trend that Mr. DeGolyer's polls also show. Although Hong Kong has rebounded from the Asian financial crisis, this normally tranquil city has been disrupted by protests over falling real estate prices and the lack of government reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeGolyer said Dr. Chung's polling methods were sound. But he noted that the professor brought a ''pro-democracy'' perspective to his work. Dr. Chung did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong University, one of the most highly regarded institutions in Asia, said it would set up a commission to investigate Dr. Chung's allegations. But student groups marched on the hilly campus, calling for the vice chancellor to resign.</p>
