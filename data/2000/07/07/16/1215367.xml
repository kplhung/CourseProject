        <p>Kadish Millet is looking forward to the day Howard Golden, Brooklyn's borough president, steps down.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millet, a songwriter and retired teacher, has long waged a campaign to get his 1978 ode to Kings County, ''Hats Off to Brooklyn!,'' adopted as the borough's official song. He has pleaded his case with elected officials and persuaded local bands and choruses to perform it.</p>
        <p>He has even played the march, with its upbeat lyrics (''You'll always know what's cookin'/ Once you've been part of Brooklyn'') on a local television news broadcast in hopes of attracting more attention. Mr. Golden's response: Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
        <p>''Howie has to leave after this term,'' said Mr. Millet, referring to the city's term limits for elected officials. ''Getting my song adopted is my sincere hope.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Millet said other songwriters  had submitted Brooklyn tunes to Mr. Golden, who has declined to crown one as the borough's official song. Mr. Golden's office confirmed this account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millet's musical ambitions have met with some success. Bing Crosby recorded his novelty ''What's More American?'' in 1968, and NASA used the tune (''What's more American than baseball?/ I am! I am!'') to wake astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1990. It is currently being played between innings at Mets games. Mr. Millet's romantic, poignant ''Valentino,'' recorded by Connie Francis in 1960, was a hit across Europe. He has also written the official spirit songs for five schools, including Mark Twain Junior High, where he last taught.</p>
        <p>The chatty, silver-haired songwriter, who refused to give his age, claims to have written more than 1,000 songs, including an ode to the Goodyear Blimp, and will break into song with little prompting.</p>
        <p>His license plates reads KM ASCAP -- his initials and the acronym for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.</p>
        <p>''When I wake up in the morning and look at that license plate,'' he said, ''I feel like a farmer looking over his fields of corn.''</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Millet wrote ''God Bless the Empire State,'' hoping that it would replace ''I Love New York'' as the state's official song. He sent a demo tape to Libby Pataki, the governor's wife.</p>
        <p>The Patakis never replied. But for Mr. Millet, who lives in Sea Gate, the fate of ''Hats Off to Brooklyn!'' is more important.</p>
        <p>''As soon as Howard leaves, I'll be there,'' Mr. Millet said. ''I'll be knocking on the door, whoever the candidate is.''</p>
