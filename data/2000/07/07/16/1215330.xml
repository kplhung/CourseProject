        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>What I did do in a similar situation:  coming down the steps of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine one Sunday afternoon after a beautiful service, I was assaulted by the boom-boom-hip-hop noise coming from the radio in a black S.U.V. stopped in front of the church with a handsome young black man sitting behind the wheel obviously waiting for someone.</p>
        <p>I walked over to his car where the window on the passenger side was open, bent over, smiled and spoke to him in a normal tone of voice. Of course, he could not hear me -- so, he turned down the volume in order to hear what I said. I looked him in the eye, smiled again, and said ''Please, young man, will you  turn down your radio while you're here in front of the church?'' He looked perplexed and said ''Why?'' I explained that people leaving church have been listening to quiet, religious music and are in a generally peaceful frame of mind. I thanked him again and immediately walked away from his car. He did not turn up the volume.</p>
        <p>Now, my situation was different from yours, because he was not at all threatened by my gray, Afro-style hair, or my black face, or my grandmotherly physique. I'm sure somewhere in his past, some woman who cared for him had spoken to him the same way that I did -- firmly, pleasantly and reasonably. You didn't have these same circumstances on your side.</p>
