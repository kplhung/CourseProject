        <p>Bill Gates is about to make his debut on another list of the affluent -- and, for once, not at the top. In the last few years, he has started spending some of his Microsoft millions on art. He will appear for the first time -- along with Elton John and Jack Nicholson -- on a roster of the world's 200 most active art collectors published each summer by ARTnews magazine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates, like most collectors, prefers to keep his purchases quiet. But he is known to be interested in iconic American paintings by artists like Winslow Homer, Andrew Wyeth and especially American Impressionists. But Mr. Gates is not among the magazine's top 10 buyers -- all also from the business world. Surpassing Mr. Gates in the auction rooms and galleries over the last year were Leon Black, Eli Broad, Donald Fisher, David Geffen, Samuel Heyman, Henry R. Kravis, Ronald S. Lauder, Francois Pinault, Charles Saatchi and Charles Schwab.</p>
