        <p>WHEN he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis six years ago, Keith Fields, an avid boater and fisherman, was living with his girlfriend in Ronkonkoma and working as an alarm installation technician. Today, at age 33, he can't even move his arms.</p>
        <p>His mother, Dianne Davis, who oversees his care while working full-time as a hairdresser, said that when his symptoms worsened about three years ago, she hired home health aides through certified agencies. But when the aides repeatedly failed to show up, Mr. Fields's girlfriend persuaded him to go into a nursing home.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, I took him out of there. That was no place for him,'' Ms. Davis said. ''He should be at home as long as he can be. He is still very mentally aware, and should be allowed to feel as independent as he can be made to feel.''</p>
        <p>For the present, Mr. Fields is back in his own apartment in Ronkonkoma with a 24-hour live-in home health aide who, for little more than minimum wage, feeds, bathes, cooks and cleans house for him. He relies on the aide, supplied through a home health agency that is reimbursed by his Medicaid benefits, to protect what is left of his independence and keep him from landing back in a nursing home.</p>
        <p>It is a struggle. Recently, Ms. Davis discovered that her son had not been changed and cleaned for a six-hour stretch. ''I nearly went ballistic,'' she said, ''but people tell me not to complain.''</p>
        <p>She knows how hard it is to find well-trained and reliable home health care on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The region's healthy economy, with the lowest unemployment rate in New York State, has not been so healthy for many of Long Island's sick, disabled and elderly. Nowadays, the home health aides that they rely on for the tasks associated with daily living can easily find less demanding, better-paying jobs. And they do.</p>
        <p>''When the economy was in the slumps there would be people lined up around the corner willing to train for certification in home health aide,'' said Mary Lou Boyle, director for public health nursing for the Suffolk County Public Health Department.</p>
        <p>''Today, someone can get a job at Stern's or Macy's for the salary equivalent to what a home health or personal aide can expect -- about $7 to $10 per hour -- and not have to worry about changing adult diapers or hoisting heavy bodies into bathrooms,'' Ms. Boyle said. ''It is also a very lonely job. It's not like working at a store where you can be with fellow employees.''</p>
        <p>Many home health aides are women from poor or minority backgrounds and are sometimes looked upon by elderly clients not so much as trained paraprofessionals but as maids. ''It is not unusual to have a client expect a health care aide to wash their windows,'' Ms. Boyle said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mary Ann Wilner, director of health policy for Paraprofessional Health Care Institute in the Bronx, a nonprofit affiliate that oversees a group of five employee-owned home health care agencies, said it is demographics rather than the healthy economy that is creating the crisis in home health care.</p>
        <p>''Even if there were to be a downturn in the economy, the problem will still not go away,'' Dr. Wilner said.  ''Compared with the stagnant caregiver population, a cohort group that tends to be women in the 25-to-50-year age range, the elderly population is growing in leaps and bounds.''  She said that the only way to correct the problem is to transform the profession into something more appealing and reduce the annual turnover rate, which, on a national basis, is 40 to 60 percent.</p>
        <p>''There is very little concern for worker benefits, training and health,'' Dr. Wilner said. ''But what we try to do is focus on the fact that it can be a good job. Many people love the work and care about caring for people. We need to figure out how to make this job more attractive. We need to extend training, improve wages, and provide full benefits, opportunities for advancement, support and supervision.''</p>
        <p>Susan Hechtman, vice president of Aides at Home Inc. in Hicksville, said the problem is money. ''We get constant calls requesting home health aides all day,'' she said. ''And out of 15 of these patients we may be able to service only five. The root of the problem is money. Agencies get reimbursed $10 per hour from insurance, which also has to include profit and overhead.''</p>
        <p>Karen Dargo, downstate market manager for Norrell Health Care, which provides nurses and paraprofessionals to health consumers, said that her employee roster has declined 25 percent to 30 percent in two years..</p>
        <p>''Based on what we can pay our staff, we can't compete with food service and retail,'' she said. ''These jobs can guarantee workers one job at one location for a full eight-hour day. Home health aides often have to travel between two and three clients within an eight-hour day.''</p>
        <p>Fione Ferrier, a 33-year-old home health care aide for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, visits four patients within her eight-hour shift. She helps her clients get out of bed, helps them shower, changes their linens, and possibly provides a meal, all within 90 minutes. Added to her duties is travel time, which, depending on traffic can be 15 to 30 minutes between visits.</p>
        <p>''I have one patient with Parkinson's disease, and it takes him a half hour just to get out of the bed,'' she said. ''By the time you get him into the shower, it's almost time to go.''</p>
        <p>She has worked for a variety of agencies in the past, but they were only able to provide her with part-time work, which had not included benefits. She says that at North Shore, she gets full-time work, benefits, gas reimbursement, training seminars and thus feels less isolated. Eventually, she hopes to go to school to become a registered nurse.</p>
        <p>For many entry-level workers like the Jamaican-born Ms. Ferrier, a position as a home health care or personal aide assistant can provide a pathway to better-paying jobs in the health industry.</p>
        <p>Home health care agencies on Long Island have been trying to compete more aggressively in the employment market by providing work incentives in the form of sign-on bonuses, health benefits, college tuition and gas allowances.</p>
        <p>Steven Sternbach, chief executive officer of Star Multi Care in Huntington Station, which runs 15 home health agencies in five northeastern states, offers his employees a choice of packages.</p>
        <p>''Do you want $8 per hour and no benefits or $7 and full insurance?'' Mr. Sternbach said. ''Maybe you have a working spouse and don't need the insurance. We also provide 401K plans and try to educate them about benefits.''</p>
        <p>He said that despite his efforts, his four Long Island offices are filling only about 75 percent to 80 percent of customer demand. There are approximately 6,020 home health aides and 4,360 personal home care aides on Long Island, according to 1997 state statistics. But the agency estimates that there will be an additional 2,400 annual openings per year through 2006.</p>
        <p>Home health care agencies are not optimistic that these openings can be filled, given the rate at which the population is aging and insurance reimbursement rates are falling. Nationwide, Medicare spending on home health care has dropped by 45 percent, from $17.5 billion in 1997 to $9.7 billion in 1999, based on data complied by the Congressional Budget Office. Furthermore, additional cuts of up to 15 percent are threatened when a new Medicare reimbursement system begins in October 2000.</p>
        <p>This system, as well as other recent cuts in health care benefits, underscores what amounts to a baffling medical paradox for health care providers.</p>
        <p>''I think that economic pressures of health care dictate that more and more patients are cared for at home,'' said Dr. Charles Robbins, associate dean of social welfare at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. ''And most patients do heal better in familiar surroundings. Families are increasingly being called upon to provide the services that were once performed by the hospitals and health care workers, yet the psycho-social supports are not in place to help them.''</p>
        <p>If it has become financially and psychologically healthier -- for both the patient and the economy -- to manage health care at home, then why aren't health care benefits being realigned?</p>
        <p>''What it will take is a legislator's mother who is not able to get home care,'' Dr. Robbins said.</p>
        <p>He also said that the shortage in home health aides is forcing patients to languish in hospitals after their medical care is completed.</p>
        <p>''The inability of home care agencies to attract the staff needed to provide services to patients results in our inability to move patients through the system as soon as they are ready,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robbins also worries that agencies, though not saying so outright, will hesitate to take on the more complicated cases if they think they can't provide care within Medicare's prescribed dollar amount.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that we trust people who are the most vulnerable in our society to be cared for by home care staff,'' Dr. Robbins said. ''Their adult children have families and careers. But we, as a society, don't value the care well enough to pay livable wages and benefits. The consequence of a good economy is that people are not willing to do these jobs. It is very hard work. We need to rethink some of our values.''</p>
