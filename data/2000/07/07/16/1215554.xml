        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>The four-game weekend series in New York was a thrill for all baseball fans in the area, regardless of who won and who lost. But a single pitch by Yankee pitcher Roger Clemens cast a pall over the city and baseball. When a major league pitcher, who has spent years and years perfecting his pitching control in his backyard, in Little League, in the minor leagues and in the majors, accidentally or purposely hits a batter as egregiously as Mets catcher Mike Piazza was hit, that pitcher deserves the punishment of Major League Baseball and a shower of shame from everyone else.</p>
