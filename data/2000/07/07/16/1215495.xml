        <p>Boston Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett is ejected from game against New York Mets after bumping home plate umpire Ronald Kulpa in chest when Kulpa marked inner edge of batter's box with his foot (M)</p>

        <p>To the Boston Red Sox, it looked suspicious. On Friday, their manager, Jimy Williams, had ordered the umpires to check the baseball for scuff marks when the Mets' Dennis Cook was pitching. Cook later threw a pitch that hit their star center fielder, Carl Everett, who is noted for crowding the plate.</p>
        <p>During Everett's first at-bat today, the home plate umpire Ronald Kulpa drew a line with his foot marking the inner edge of the batter's box. Everett was incensed, and he barked loudly at Kulpa, earning an ejection that touched off a tirade by Everett.</p>
        <p>Five minutes of histrionics followed Everett's ejection. He bumped Kulpa with his chest, slammed his helmet to the ground, then knocked his head into Kulpa's as he screamed in the umpire's face.</p>
        <p>Kulpa staggered back, and as the other umpires gathered around him, Everett's eruption continued. He shoved aside the first base coach Tommy Harper, who along with Williams was trying to restrain him. Everett pointed repeatedly at the inner edge of the batter's box, and he would not leave the home plate area.</p>
        <p>Mets right fielder Derek Bell, who grew up with Everett in Florida and was teammates with him in Houston, jogged in to try to calm Everett. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine -- who said he did not feel it was Bell's place to intervene -- intercepted Bell before he confronted Everett.</p>
        <p>''If I got there sooner, I could have gotten him out of there,'' Bell said. ''They don't know him like I know him. I'm like a big brother to him.''</p>
        <p>Everett was in no mood to listen. When he finally retreated to the dugout, he shouted at some teammates and tossed a water cooler. He has much more than an equipment fine coming his way: for bumping an umpire -- twice -- Everett will probably be reprimanded severely.</p>
        <p>''We'll see what Frank Robinson has to say,'' Williams said, referring to baseball's vice president for on-field operations. ''We haven't lost our player yet. He's still eligible to play.''</p>
        <p>Williams said the Mets had told the umpires to enforce the limits of the batter's box with Everett hitting.</p>
        <p>''I know it came from the other side,'' he said. ''I don't even have to ask. I know it did. If you do that, why wait for the third game? It might have been retaliation.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said, ''Jimy Williams is incorrect, out of bounds and ridiculous making statements that he has no clue about.''</p>
        <p>Through a Red Sox spokesman, Everett had no comment; neither did Kulpa. But it is well known that any contact with an umpire is strictly off limits.</p>
        <p>''When he was getting upset, I was out of there,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said. ''He was not in a good mood. I didn't want to get hit in the cross-fire. It was an unfortunate incident. Any time you bump an umpire, it's not good. You can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Cox, manager of the Atlanta Braves, began serving a five-game suspension on Friday for bumping an umpire on July 4.</p>
        <p>Mets pitcher Mike Hampton was a teammate of Everett's for two years in Houston, and he said he never saw umpires challenge Everett on standing too close to the plate. But, like Valentine, Hampton said the Mets had nothing to do with today's incident.</p>
        <p>''Nobody did -- it was the umpire taking it upon himself,'' Hampton said. ''It's his job. He felt he was standing on the line or out of the box, and he wanted to enforce the rule.''</p>
