        <p>Two years ago, when Clifton Johnson, then 10, found out that he was going camping in the wilds of Maine, he thought he knew what to expect. He even offered his host mother a bit of advice. ''Don't forget to bring a gun; we're going to have to shoot down a buffalo for dinner,'' he said, fully expecting to survive on the big game they would find roaming around the woods.</p>
        <p>His hosts, Lisa and Rick Jamieson and their two children, responded with a laugh and told him that they would be taking their own food.</p>
        <p>''I didn't realize it was that kind of camping,'' Clifton said recently. ''I thought it was the wild kind of camping. When I watch stuff on TV, there's always an animal. I was always afraid to go camping, but when I realized it was only a campsite and there were no animals, I was relieved.''</p>
        <p>Clifton, who lives with his mother, 14-year-old brother and a dog in a three-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building in Harlem, has stayed with the Jamiesons for two weeks every summer for the last six years at their secluded four-bedroom house in Sheffield, Mass., through a program run by the Fresh Air Fund. The fund is a nonprofit agency that provides needy children from New York City with free summer vacations in the country.</p>
        <p>In addition to teaching Clifton a little about life in the country, the vacations have helped him make new friends: the Jamiesons' two children, Max, 10, and Alex, 9, and the friends and relatives who play with them.</p>
        <p>''Oh boy, I couldn't calm down,'' Max said of his wait last week for the bus that Clifton was to arrive on. ''I was so excited to see Clifton. I like it a lot better when he's here. When he's not here, I'm always bored.''</p>
        <p>The Fresh Air Fund was not unfamiliar to Mrs. Jamieson. Her involvement in the program began when she was 2 or 3, she said, and her mother, Sandy Fallon, invited a young girl from New York, Elizabeth Maldonado, into their home. Ms. Maldonado and Mrs. Jamieson became close friends, Mrs. Jamieson said, and still keep in touch.</p>
        <p>''I never even thought of it as being a Fresh Air Fund program,'' Mrs. Jamieson said. ''I always thought of her as a sister who just didn't live with us a lot of the time.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jamieson first wanted to take in a child about 10 years ago, when her sister Laurene Hewins took in one, but she decided to wait until her boys were a little older and closer in age to children chosen by the fund.</p>
        <p>Last week, when the Fresh Air Fund discovered that a host family near the Jamiesons had moved away without the agency's knowledge, she volunteered to take in a second child, Desmond Van Duyne, 8, from the Bronx. Though the decision was made at the last minute, she is glad Desmond has joined Clifton and the family -- and so are the children.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad he came,'' Max said of the latest addition to his pool of playmates. ''I hope he comes next year.''</p>
        <p>The summers the Jamieson boys spend with Clifton are similar to the summers their mother spent with Ms. Maldonado: heavy on outdoor activity. The boys usually go fishing in a freshwater stream across the road, go on one-  to four-hour hikes at a nearby Audubon Society bird sanctuary, swim in their backyard pool, play basketball and baseball and watch minor-league baseball games. They have tickets for a game later this month between the Pittsfield Mets and the Mahoning Valley Scrappers.</p>
        <p>Max and Alex also race miniature drag-racing cars that go up to 70 miles per hour, and watching them has been Clifton's first exposure to the sport, he said.</p>
        <p>Were it not for his time at the Jamiesons', Clifton said, he would probably just hang around his apartment, watching television and playing video games.</p>
        <p>After seeing one another for the first time in a year, Clifton, Max and Alex commemorated the visit appropriately when they first got to the Jamiesons' home last week: they traded Pokemon cards.</p>
        <p>''They were really excited by the cards that I had because they hadn't seen most of them yet,'' said Clifton, who gets Pokemon cards at a toy store on Broadway near 138th Street. ''They were asking questions like, 'Where did you get them?' And I told them a store around my house sells them.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency can send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
