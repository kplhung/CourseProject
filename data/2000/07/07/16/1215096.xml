        <p>Thomas Matthew Pilgrim and Robert Brown,  Parkview Homes, Athens, Ga.</p>
        <p>Pilgrim (left): Ask anybody in Athens about me and Robert, they'll say that we are always together. I'm 15. He's 17. We think just alike, act just alike and dress just alike. If he wasn't black and if I wasn't white, people could think that we were brothers. A brother in every sense of the word.</p>
        <p>I'm part Mexican. I'm probably the only white person in Athens with their hair braided. I just did it because if it's long, it's hard to keep up with. Most of the people I know are black or Mexican. As far as I know they don't have a problem with me. But there's always got to be an odd person that has to say something. One woman said, ''Look, white boy, why you got your hair braided?'' I just stopped caring what people think about me.</p>
        <p>My sister and I have different fathers, and her father's side of the family are just real big rednecks. All they like are people with the same skin as them. But race doesn't matter to me and my sister. And Robert and the other people I hang with don't care that I'm white. They were who I stuck with when I first moved here two and a half years ago. They took to me and really helped me. He's my best friend.</p>
        <p>Brown (right): I was going to fight him at first. I'm not going to lie. The homeboys I used to hang around with were like, ''Hey man, look at that white boy.'' But my friend Jason knew Matt, so it was cool. I asked him his name. I told him mine. We started chilling from there.</p>
        <p>All my friends are black except for Matthew. It'd be about 30 of us and Matt. But if you say he's trying to act black, he gets very offended. We don't tease him. He fits right in with me. He acts the way he wants to act. He acts like everybody else that I hang around with. I don't care that he's white. But I wouldn't be walking around with a Chinese dude -- nah, I'm just playing.</p>
        <p>If you want to find me, you look for Matt. Every day, all day, we hang out. We play basketball, beat each other up, listen to rap.</p>
        <p>We have fun. Like I'm going to sleep at 4 o'clock in the morning and this nigger wants to play. He's my boy. I never got into a fight with Matt as long as I've known him. I'd rather smack myself.</p>
