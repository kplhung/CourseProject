        <p>A SOCCER goal is an inviting 8 yards wide by 8 feet high. When protecting it, being tall is an advantage.</p>
        <p>John Jay High School won the Section B championship recently, thanks in large part to its goalie, Jill Vaccaro, who gave up no goals in four playoff games.</p>
        <p>When they measured her before the season, Vaccaro was 5 foot 1. ''She plays a lot bigger,'' said Paul Smith, the John Jay girls' coach for the last 16 years, who has been coaching high school soccer for 25 years.</p>
        <p>''The irony of it,'' Mr. Smith said, ''is that in terms of her height, Jill's small. But in terms of her jumping ability, her energy, her range, her quickness, her fearlessness and her anticipation, she covers a lot of ground.''</p>
        <p>And a lot of goal. In 21 games this past season, Vaccaro came up with 11 shutouts and permitted just 18 goals. In John Jay's most important playoff game, against an 18-1 Our Lady of Lourdes of Poughkeepsie team, which had beaten it by 1-0 during the regular season, Vaccaro came up with 15 saves in a 1-0 turnabout.</p>
        <p>Still, the statistics are always with her. ''Height? I think about it?'' asked Vaccaro, a South Salem resident who has just returned from an Olympic Developmental camp in Rhode Island. ''I play with and against really tall goalies. It's a handicap. I just play around it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith noticed that early. ''She played in our modified program for seventh and eight graders,'' the coach said. ''She played both in the field and in the goal. As a goalie, she was so aggressive, when the play was at the other end, she'd come up almost to midfield. And she was so quick, she came out aggressively to challenge a shooter. With that range, you could see that she could be a goalie.''</p>
        <p>She has been, at least part time, since she was 4, Linda Vaccaro, Jill's mother, said. ''South Salem has a prekindergarten soccer program and Jill really loved it from the start,'' Mrs. Vaccaro said.</p>
        <p>By way of explanation, her daughter said: ''The flow of the game. If it's played right, soccer is really beautiful to watch. And as a goalie, it unfolds in front of you.''</p>
        <p>As a goalie, Vaccaro created something of a problem for Mr. Smith when she reached John Jay. ''When Jill was a freshman,'' he said, ''we had a veteran senior goalie, a tall girl named Sherri Sklar. But as the season progressed, it became clear we were a better team with Jill in goal, and Sherri was very gracious about it.That's the year we turned the corner, got over .500 and became a good team, finishing third in our league.</p>
        <p>''By the time Jill was a sophomore, the job was clearly hers and she continued to improve. You could see she was something special. I told her she just had to play bigger, and she can reach the top of the goal because she jumps so well. We made it to the sectional finals, where we lost to Horace Greeley, 2 to 1, but I thought Jill was the best player on the field that day.''</p>
        <p>And getting better. Soccer had become a year-round sport for Vaccaro. She was chosen for the Olympic Developmental Program last fall and this summer has been guarding goal for the Hudson Valley Lightning, a premier team in Newburgh.</p>
        <p>''After the developmental program you could see a real improvement in her technique,'' Smith said, ''in her ability to play the angles.''</p>
        <p>And this season she got her revenge on Greeley, even stopping a penalty shot in a 5-0 shutout.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to keep on improving and keep on playing,'' Vaccaro said. ''I'd love to play in college and even beyond.''</p>
        <p>For Vaccaro, being the last line of defense, the most visible culprit when a goal is allowed, doesn't hurt. ''I don't think about it,'' she said. ''I'm just another player.''</p>
        <p>As she has gotten better, Vaccaro has gotten more assertive. ''She's shy, a very quiet girl,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Her freshman year, she wouldn't say a word. But she's at her loudest on the field. She'll yell at someone to get in position or mark someone.''</p>
        <p>Susan Palladino, a fullback who just graduated, said: ''She's awesome, an awesome goalie. And with her friends, she opens up, too. But on the field, you can really hear her. Even up at midfield, you can hear her saying, 'Move up, move up.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Vaccaro agreed. ''It's almost a Jekyll-and-Hyde thing,'' she said. ''She's relatively quiet, but on the field, she makes her presence felt.''</p>
        <p>It is, in a sense, a growing presence.</p>
        <p>''We measured her the other day,'' Mrs. Vaccaro said. ''She's grown. She's now about 5 foot 2 1/4!''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
