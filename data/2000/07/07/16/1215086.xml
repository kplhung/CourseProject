      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>About three months ago, I joined a staffing firm as a recruiter. My immediate superior as well as the majority of my colleagues are Jewish. It didn't take long until my boss and co-workers started making ''jokes'' about my race, calling me ''colored'' and ordering me to go sit in the back of the bus (referring to the back of the office, where I sat). I was devastated that they thought they weren't being racist just because they were Jewish. I complained to one of the executive partners of the company, but they did nothing to change the caustic environment or to protect me from retaliation.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid that people really have given up on being sensitive about cultural issues. Everybody wants to ''tolerate'' one another, which really means: ''Let's not fight, O.K.? Let's just ignore one another as much as possible, work together in a very hierarchical relationship and talk about everything but racism.'' Teaching tolerance is a bunch of baloney.</p>
