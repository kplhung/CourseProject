        <p>Q When our co-op recently sent out its notice of annual meeting and election of directors, it enclosed a sample proxy form in the envelope. No instructions were included and there was no representation that a proxy was being solicited by the board or that it would be voted at the discretion of the board.</p>
        <p>If a shareholder executed the proxy and specifically filled in the name of the board president or another individual director as the shareholder's proxy, does the board as a whole have the right to determine how the proxy should be voted, or does the proxy belong to the individual director who is named by the shareholder? . . .

        <p>Q When our co-op recently sent out its notice of annual meeting and election of directors, it enclosed a sample proxy form in the envelope. No instructions were included and there was no representation that a proxy was being solicited by the board or that it would be voted at the discretion of the board.</p>
        <p>If a shareholder executed the proxy and specifically filled in the name of the board president or another individual director as the shareholder's proxy, does the board as a whole have the right to determine how the proxy should be voted, or does the proxy belong to the individual director who is named by the shareholder? . . . Matthew E. Oren, Flushing, Queens.</p>
        <p>A Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a proxy vote can be cast only by the person named by the shareholder. At the same time, Mr. Weinstein said, if a shareholder designates only the proxy, but does not direct the proxy to vote in a specific manner, the proxy is free to vote in any way he wishes.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Weinstein said, if the proxy is given to an existing director, there is a good possibility that the proxyholder will vote the shares in a manner consistent with the wishes of the board as a whole.</p>
        <p>''Some boards have understandings among themselves whereby the members agree that any proxies received by the board, the managing agent or individual board members will be voted for the slate recommended by the board,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein said that if a shareholder wants some added assurance that the shares will be voted in a certain way, the shareholder can make what is called a directed proxy and give it to someone he trusts will show up to vote.</p>
        <p>With such a proxy, Mr. Weinstein said, the shareholder designates both the proxy and the candidates for whom the shareholder wants the proxy to vote.</p>
        <p>'Good Income' Vs. 'Bad Income'</p>
        <p>Q Is there a federal tax rule about the percentage of income a co-op is allowed to receive from sources other than shareholders' maintenance fees? For example, may 30 percent of a co-op's income come from renting out apartments for commercial use? . . . Arlene J. Modman, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Steven Goldman, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that for co-op shareholders to be allowed to take a federal income tax deduction for their proportionate share of property taxes and interest on their share loans, no more than 20 percent of the co-op corporation's income may be derived from sources other than shareholders.</p>
        <p>''The way we usually talk about this is in terms of 'good income' vs. 'bad income,' '' Mr. Goldman said, with the former term used for income derived from shareholders and the latter for nonshareholder sources.</p>
        <p>''It's important to understand that good income doesn't necessarily have to come from maintenance fees,'' he said, adding that other sources might be profits from recreation areas and laundry rooms used and paid for by shareholders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman said that while ''bad income'' is usually derived from commercial tenants, it is possible that other sources of income could fall into that category. For example, he said, interest on a reserve fund could be considered good income or bad income, depending on the circumstances. ''If the reserve fund is maintained strictly for the improvement of the property, then the interest income it produces could be considered good income,'' he said. ''But if it's just a place to put money aside for future picnics, the interest it earns is probably not going to be considered good income.''</p>
        <p>If 30 percent of a building's income is from renting apartments to commercial tenants, Mr. Goldman said, it would almost certainly be considered bad income. And that, he said, would result in the shareholders being prohibited from taking tax and interest deductions on their personal returns.</p>
        <p>Q &amp; A  Correction:  July 23, 2000, Sunday  An answer in the Q&amp;A column last Sunday about shareholders' ability to claim interest and property-tax deductions on their federal income tax returns misstated the classification of interest earned on a reserve fund. As noted, at least 80 percent of a co-op's income must come from shareholders in order for them to claim the deductions. Interest on a reserve fund is not countable as coming from shareholders, no matter how the fund is used.</p>
