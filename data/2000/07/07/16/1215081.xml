        <p>On the surface, race relations in the United States have gotten better. There are laws to protect minorities. Discrimination is more subtle than that. No one calls you a ''nigger'' to your face -- they only treat you like one. When blacks are hired into companies, it's difficult for them to climb. I get the impression that whites think we should be thankful for just having a job. Some time ago, before the end of apartheid, a white girl told me, ''Things could be worse -- look at South Africa.''</p>
