        <p>Vanderbilt: I was just actually looking in my diary, and Gordon and I met in April of 1954, and he came to photograph me for Life magazine. I was making my debut on the stage that summer.</p>
        <p>Parks: Then later, when you had your exhibition, I came to photograph you again.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt: Right, at an exhibition of my paintings. I lived in Europe until I was 9, really. I had never seen a black person or heard of a black person or even knew that they existed. And then when I came to live with my aunt in Old Westbury, I never really -- again, there was never any discussion of blacks. In New York growing up, you never saw a black person on the street, you never saw a black person in the store, you never saw them in a restaurant. It just didn't exist. So when Gordon and I met, it was really without any boundaries. First of all, he was drop-dead good-looking. We just looked into each other's eyes, and we were friends.</p>
        <p>Parks: Both of us were in pursuit of different cultural aspects. She was a painter; she was writing poetry. Sometimes she would send me a little poem, which encouraged me to start writing poetry. I started answering back with poetry. In retrospect, I realize that this is the first time in 47 years that we've ever even talked about race.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt: We've never, ever discussed it. It just didn't//</p>
        <p>Parks: Come up.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt: I felt that he had an enormous amount of respect for me, and I for him, and did from the very beginning. And a lot of love too.</p>
        <p>Parks: We dated.</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt: Well . . . we're still dating [laughs]. It's been a long date. I really put bigotry at the top of the list of things that I despise, and I'm still appalled by the ignorance of . . . well, I hate to say my family, because it really is encompassing a whole section of Long Island, of people still who still live in Locust Valley, and they still are obsessed with talking about les juifs et les n gres [the Jews and the blacks] and their trust funds. These are the three conversations that are very absorbing to them. And, I mean, I'm not faced with that, really, because I don't, I'm not in it anymore. I also remember, for example, when I was about 14 and I had a nurse who was really like a substitute mother to me. When the custody came, she was sent away and my aunt Gertrude got a series of other nurses to come in, and I remember once one was talking about ''the darkies'' and how they were happy on the plantation and they should have been left there. I thought, What is she talking about? Yet somewhere it just seemed not to be fair. And then, of course, the first real bigotry that I encountered was against Jews, much more than blacks, because blacks weren't even in the picture. And one of the things that would be said was, ''Well, we all have our favorite Jew.'' It was meant as a compliment, of course. And usually that favorite Jew was very rich.</p>
        <p>Parks: A lot of people see the autobiographical film ''The Learning Tree,'' and they say, ''You should be angry with white people, and so forth.'' And I say, ''Why should I be angry with white people?'' And they say, ''Well I read your book and what you suffered in Kansas.'' And I say: ''Well, that was Kansas. Have you forgotten the fact that Marilyn Murphy gave me my first chance to shoot fashion at her store out in St. Paul? Have you forgotten that Alex Lieberman gave me a chance at Vogue? How Gloria presented herself in such a beautiful way? How am I going to be mad at white people? I have no reasons whatsoever to be concerned.''</p>
