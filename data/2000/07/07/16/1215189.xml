        <p>ARTHUR SZYK, a naturalized American citizen originally from Poland, wielded a paintbrush to express his patriotic fervor. A leading political artist during World War II (he was born in 1894 and died in 1951), Mr. Szyk produced hundreds of anti-Axis illustrations and cartoons in aid of the Allied war effort.</p>
        <p>In 1950, for the 150th anniversary of the founding of New Canaan, the artist, who worked in a studio in his New Canaan home, presented the town with his illuminated version of the Declaration of Independence, now at the Library of Congress.</p>
        <p>''This is the 50th anniversary of that work and we are about to enter the 200th anniversary year of New Canaan in 2001,'' said Janet Lindstrom, executive director of the New Canaan Historical Society, of their motivation to mount the exhibition ''Humanity: Arthur Szyk's View of the World'' in their Town House Museum through July 28. It follows a similar exhibition that ended in May at the Library of Congress.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindstrom added that this was a change of course for the museum, which normally presents costumes in a historical context. ''We have only held two other art shows here,'' she said. ''This is our first one-man show and it has a more direct message.''</p>
        <p>More than 100 works -- depicting war, oppression, freedom and patriotism -- range from illuminated manuscript and book illustrations to cartoons and commercial art.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szyk experimented with media and style, most notably with illumination, an art form associated with medieval religious art and 16th-century Persian miniatures. His work was crafted with minute detail in electrifying colors, gold adding momentum and fervor. And exhaustive research enabled him to interpret historical events in graphically compelling ways.</p>
        <p>''Washington and the American Revolution,'' a series of 38 miniatures capturing the battles of the Revolutionary War, were created in 1930 while the artist, who had not yet been to America, was living in Paris. They were purchased by President Ignacy Moscicki of Poland as a gift for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, hung in the White House until 1943 and are now in the Roosevelt Museum in Hyde Park, N.Y.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Mr. Szyk's cartoons appeared on covers of magazines including Time, Collier's, Liberty and Coronet. The artist was described by Eleanor Roosevelt as a ''one-man army'' against injustice; he was also referred to as ''Roosevelt's soldier with pen.''</p>
        <p>The patriotic theme is strong, as is religion. A Haggadah (a book of the exodus of Jewish people from Egypt in ancient times) is showcased, as are designs for stained-glass windows, a bronze temple door, and tempted by other realms, illustrations for ''The Thousand and One  Nights'' and Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szyk was also called on by the United Nations to create visual histories of its member states including the United States, Poland and Canada. (The United States is expressed with miniature images of the pony express, a Mississippi steamship, a locomotive, the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge and New York City's skyline.) For Mr. Szyk, the tumultuous events of the 20th century served as a backdrop and catalyst against the rise of Communism, fascism and the Nazi movement. He used pencil, pen and ink for political cartoons. In ''John Bull's Arab Puppet Show'' (John Bull represented England as Uncle Sam represents the United States), John Bull is shown as a puppet master setting into play the powers of Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. The figures tangle, thrust into contorted positions.</p>
        <p>''The show is a statement,'' Ms. Lindstrom said, ''of one man's creative fight against oppression and search for freedom.''</p>
        <p>The New Canaan Historical Society, 13 Oenoke Ridge, New Canaan, is open Tuesday through Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. The number to call for further information is (203) 966-1776.</p>
