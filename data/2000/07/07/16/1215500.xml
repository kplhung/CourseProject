        <p>A man who apparently intended to rob a fast-food restaurant in Brooklyn early yesterday poked a shotgun through an opening in the shop's security partition and killed a clerk with a single blast to the head, the police said.</p>
        <p>The gunman ran out of the restaurant, Ala King Fried Chicken &amp; Pizza Hot at 1591 Broadway in Bushwick, without any money, said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a police spokesman. Two other employees were in another part of the store at the time of the 1:30 a.m. killing, but neither saw the shooting, he said. Lieutenant Biegel said it was unclear why the gunman shot the clerk, who was identified as Mahbubur Rahman, 27, of Brooklyn.</p>
