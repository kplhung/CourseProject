        <p>''The Fallacy of 'Standard' Children'' [Opinion, June 25] rings so true. But for those children who have significant emotional and/or behavioral issues it is also maddening.</p>
        <p>My 11-year-old son is extremely bright and has much academic potential, but he suffers from performance-anxiety, a poor ability to concentrate and low self-esteem.</p>
        <p>Upon entering an intensive special program, he was tested by conventional methods. If it is preposterous to evaluate children generally and try to fit them into molds with standardized testing, just imagine how ridiculous it is to judge an emotionally disturbed child by such test scores.</p>
        <p>As a result, my son spent his school year working far below his grade level. He is doing well emotionally, but it is obvious that scholastically, he will never catch up. The scary part is that there are so many children like him.</p>
