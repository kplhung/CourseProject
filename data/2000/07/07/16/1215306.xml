        <p>The Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the Cape May-Lewes Ferry, says it has  completed steps to halt food contamination and service problems. Last month  the Food and Drug Administration found several violations on two of the five boats operated by the authority. The federal agency, which handles the inspections because the boats run between two states, found food stored at wrong temperatures and workers handling food in an unsanitary manner. A spokesman for the bay authority said technicians had  recalibrated the cooking and refrigeration appliances and that employees were undergoing training.</p>
