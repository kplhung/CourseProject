        <p>SANDY SPECTOR went to see the medium John Edward because she wanted word from her husband, Marty, who died last month.

        <p>She was fortunate. Lately, it has been difficult to get any of Mr. Edward's time. The 30-year-old psychic, who was raised in Glen Cove, has appeared on television shows like ''Larry King Live'' and ''Entertainment Tonight.'' He has written a book, ''One Last Time.'' He is the subject of a USA network television special, ''Messages From the Dead: The John Edward Story.''

        <p>SANDY SPECTOR went to see the medium John Edward because she wanted word from her husband, Marty, who died last month. Mrs. Spector, who attended one of Mr. Edward's group sessions here last week at the invitation of a reporter to serve as a control, received more information than she bargained for.</p>
        <p>She was fortunate. Lately, it has been difficult to get any of Mr. Edward's time. The 30-year-old psychic, who was raised in Glen Cove, has appeared on television shows like ''Larry King Live'' and ''Entertainment Tonight.'' He has written a book, ''One Last Time.'' He is the subject of a USA network television special, ''Messages From the Dead: The John Edward Story.'' And his own television show, ''Crossing Over With John Edward'' -- a five-day-a-week series on the Sci-Fi network in which he attempts to connect audience members with their dearly departed -- made its debut last week.</p>
        <p>''There are so many people who want to see me that the natural progression was to move from one-on-ones to the larger audience television can bring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Edward's office, an anxious group of 15 women sat quietly in a mirrored room that is also a dance studio. Like his wife, Sandra, Mr. Edward also teaches dancing.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Spector sat in the back row, watching Mr. Edward connect -- and not connect -- with some people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edward berated one young woman, saying, ''I refuse to believe there is no South American connection.'' He insisted the friend who accompanied her had a relative who had a farm. Her friend denied it, saying there was property that was ''like a farm,'' but she wouldn't call it a farm. ''If you're not going to cooperate,'' he yelled at her, ''I'm going to ask you to leave.'' She answered, ''Well, it did have chickens.''</p>
        <p>Three hours into the session, Mr. Edward zeroed in on Mrs. Spector and asked: ''Who is Maurice, Morris, Marvin? I'm getting an M-A sound.'' She answered stoically, ''Marty.'' Next came rapid-fire names, initials and events. She connected with each. ''That's my father.'' ''That's my name.'' ''Yes, I was married twice.'' ''Sarah is my grandmother.'' ''Yes, my grandfather had tuberculosis.''</p>
        <p>He asked her if she had a friend whose husband recently died. Yes. ''Did he die outside?'' Yes. ''What does the third mean?'' Marty died on June 3.</p>
        <p>''Marty says, 'Thank you,' '' Mr. Edward told Mrs. Spector, in a moment of palpable emotion.</p>
        <p>''I'm not here to give messages like 'I love you' or 'thank you,' '' Mr. Edward said the day before. ''I'm just here to make validations. To let these people know their loved ones crossed over, and they'll be there waiting for them.''</p>
        <p>''Unbelievable bull,'' said James Randi, who performed magic as the Amazing Randi and has since turned to debunking psychics. He has a standing offer of $1 million for any psychic who can scientifically prove his ability. Most celebrated psychics and mediums have rejected Mr. Randi's offer. Mr. Edward said: ''I am not going to participate in a test given by a magician. I'll participate in a real research study.''</p>
        <p>And that's just what he and several other psychics are doing. Mr. Edward is part of a group of mediums involved in a University of Arizona study conducted by Dr. Gary Schwartz, a Harvard-trained professor of psychology, medicine, physiology and psychiatry. Dr. Schwartz, who taught at Yale, is testing the survival-of-consciousness hypothesis: Does human energy live on after death?</p>
        <p>Dr. Terry Sandbek, a clinical psychologist from Woodland, Calif., and the president of the Sacramento Skeptics Society, says the study is flawed and that mediumship is ''a complete fraud.''</p>
        <p>''It is absolute cruelty what these mediums are doing,'' he said. ''It is all trickery. And they are preying upon vulnerable people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Randi goes a step further. ''These people should be arrested.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schwartz says it's simple: ''If mediums want to be counted, scientists should count them.''</p>
        <p>So how do psychics know astonishing facts about people. According to Mr. Randi, mediums who do cold readings like Mr. Edward ''fish, suggest possibilities, make educated guesses and give options.''</p>
        <p>''For every 500 non-dazzling answers,'' he added, ''there's one bombshell people remember. They will think they hear one thing, and go home and listen to a tape of the reading and find out its was something altogether different.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Edward, ''the gift'' first presented itself when he was 15 when he went for a reading to debunk a psychic. Instead she wowed him with facts, including one that he himself was psychic. Within two years, he said, ''I began making connections with the other side.'' But it wasn't until 1989, when his mother died, that he ''made this a personal quest.''</p>
        <p>While some psychics complain that Mr. Edward is selling out and charging too much money ($300 for a 30-minute private session), Mr. Edward says the high-profile life on which he is embarking is a difficult one. ''People have higher expectations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Caroline Tamer, whose mother attended the Huntington session, said of Mr. Edward: ''He certainly has that star quality. He's different from the rest. He seems like a real Long Island kid. He speaks quickly, he's family oriented and he has a lot of attitude.''</p>
        <p>''I'm just a regular guy,'' Mr. Edward said. ''I just happen to receive all this energy. Believe me, it's not always fun.''</p>
        <p>The day after her session, Mr. Edward reflected on Mrs. Spector's experience. ''Most come back without a message of thanks, but Marty insisted on thanking her,'' he said. ''It was that important.''</p>
        <p>Choking up, Mrs. Spector, said, ''Oh God, I have to be a believer.''</p>
