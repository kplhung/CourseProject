        <p>Lunch with Churchill. Weekends at the country house of Anthony Eden, Britain's Minister of War.</p>
        <p>These were not part of the itinerary of most young Americans who were shipped off to World War II. But Whitelaw Reid was not just any American. He was the son of the owners of The New York Herald Tribune, and he went into the Battle of Britain in 1940 armed with a pen as well as contacts with such family friends as former President Herbert Hoover.</p>
        <p>His dispatches about Britain's stand against Hitler and the speeches he gave when he returned to America helped sway public opinion in favor of the British.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reid, who now lives in Bedford Hills, is one of dozens of people interviewed for ''Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain,'' a four-hour PBS mini-series. The result is a program that is both personally compelling and politically revealing. ''Finest Hour'' will be broadcast on WNET, Channel 13, today and tomorrow at 9 p.m.; the first evening's program covers the events of May through August 1940, while the second evening continues through November 1940. The companion book, by Tim Clayton and Phil Craig, was released this week by Simon &amp; Schuster; the price is $27.50.</p>
