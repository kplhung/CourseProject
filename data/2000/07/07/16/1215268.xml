        <p>Craig Mason was headed for a pit bull show in nearby Pilesgrove down in the southwestern corner of the state and had not intended to get on the New Jersey Turnpike after crossing the Delaware Memorial Bridge. But the 30-year-old dog lover from North Carolina and his traveling companion did not mind the little bit of accidental tourism.</p>
        <p>''At least we could we could say we were on the turnpike,'' said Mr. Mason. ''It's a real famous road. Everybody travels on it.''</p>
        <p>But the bleach-blond surfer, whose day job involves installing vinyl siding, was underwhelmed by the toll plaza at Interchange 1. ''It looks like any other toll booth to me,'' he said -- exactly the kind of reaction that tourist-conscious turnpike officials do not like to hear.</p>
        <p>True enough. The row of utilitarian metal stalls -- slathered in dank green paint -- look like something out of an oversized army surplus store. So when the turnpike authority spends $44 million in everyone's nickels, dimes and quarters (no pennies, please) to replace the 49-year-old plaza that opened in 1951, what will welcome northbound motorists and bid farewell to their southbound counterparts may indeed by unlike any other toll booth on Earth.</p>
        <p>In the shadow of DuPont's sprawling monument to better living through chemistry will be a gleaming palace of pay-as-you-go. The plaza -- you might call it The Plaza of toll booths -- will be a two-story monument of masonry and glass with a lighthouse-inspired spire, symbolic of New Jersey's coastal heritage, rising between the north and south lanes. The second floor will be a passageway for toll takers, who now have to scurry across the asphalt, to descend to their air-conditioned booths in mini-elevators.</p>
        <p>Though the interchange will increase to 23 lanes from 15, including 7 on the entry side where the transactions involve only snatching up the ticket and 16 lanes for paying the toll, it will at first have only two lanes set aside in each direction for EZ-Pass electronic toll collection.</p>
        <p>The decision to have relatively few E-ZPASS lanes is notable because the Delaware River and Bay Authority, a bi-state agency of New Jersey and Delaware, plans to convert two of the Delaware Memorial Bridge's 13 toll lanes to the new technology early next year. (The start of EZ-Pass, by the way, will not wait for construction of the new plaza; the electronic traffic decongestant is scheduled to begin at all 28 toll plazas along the 148-mile highway on Sept. 30.)</p>
        <p>Lynn Fleeger, a spokeswoman for the turnpike, could not provide the formula used to calculate EZ-Pass use. But Gerry DiNicola, director of management information services for the bridge agency, said projections showed that 20 percent of bridge's 47,000 daily crossings would involve EZ-Pass.</p>
        <p>The primary reason for the new toll plaza, said Ms. Fleeger, ''is to eliminate the congestion and the bottlenecks over there.'' But, she added, ''since we're going to be building a new plaza and expanding it, we wanted to make it a true gateway to New Jersey, aesthetically pleasing as well as functional.''</p>
        <p>Who knows? Snowbirds headed down from Fort Lee might pay with pride that $3.65 toll.</p>
        <p>Cars and trucks make an average daily total of 40,300 trips through Interchange 1, including 19,833 entries, and 20,479 exits. (Apparently, what goes up does not necessarily have to come down on the turnpike. But don't ask Ms. Fleeger to explain the discrepancy; she can't.)</p>
        <p>The volume doubles on holiday weekends, with the day before Thanksgiving the busiest of the year. The interchange is not a particularly heavy commuter portal, however, with only about 1,700 vehicles an hour passing through it at peak periods, Ms. Fleeger said.</p>
        <p>In addition to being expanded, the new plaza will be relocated, moving from Deepwater to Carney's Point, 1.2 miles farther from the bridge.</p>
        <p>One recent afternoon, a few hundred feet from the old green toll booths, at the Wellesly Inn and Suites, Allison Ruhl, a 21-year-old desk clerk, said she paid her tolls every day on the way to and from her home in Quinton. Most days she sat in traffic, Ms. Ruhl said, so any expansion sounded like a good idea to her.</p>
        <p>But the price tag ''sounds like a lot,'' she added, especially for an item she would have expected to be strictly no-frills. ''I mean, a toll's a toll,'' she said.</p>
