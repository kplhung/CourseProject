        <p>The last time the United States and Vietnam spent five years arguing over the details of a major accord, they cleared the way for America to withdraw from Vietnam. This time, Hanoi is hoping for an invasion -- of American business. The two nations signed a sweeping agreement that commits Vietnam to observing open trade and investment rules that most of its Asian neighbors follow. Hanoi hopes the agreement will lift its stagnant economy and allow the Communist bureaucracy to develop a more investor-friendly image.</p>
