        <p>Voters lose fascination with New York State Senate campaign between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A Lazio; diminishing interest is attributed partly to substitution of Lazio for New York City Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani, who dropped out of race citing health and personal reasons; aides in both Lazio and Clinton camps also note that fatigue has crept over electorate because campaigning started almost immediately after last election, when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced he would not seek re-election; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For the last year, perhaps the best place to measure the frenzy that was the United States Senate race in New York was in the cramped, cluttered press office for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign. There, across the street from Madison Square Garden, Mrs. Clinton's aides fielded hundreds of inquiries from around the globe every day, all the while directing assaults on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and responding to incoming attacks.</p>
        <p>But the other day, a hot and languid weekday July afternoon, the scene on Seventh Avenue was almost tranquil. The phones were relatively silent. Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's driven press secretary, who would normally be juggling at least two telephone calls and three e-mail exchanges at once, even found a free moment to search through Rotisserie League baseball sites on the Web.</p>

        <p>For the last year, perhaps the best place to measure the frenzy that was the United States Senate race in New York was in the cramped, cluttered press office for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign. There, across the street from Madison Square Garden, Mrs. Clinton's aides fielded hundreds of inquiries from around the globe every day, all the while directing assaults on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and responding to incoming attacks.</p>
        <p>But the other day, a hot and languid weekday July afternoon, the scene on Seventh Avenue was almost tranquil. The phones were relatively silent. Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's driven press secretary, who would normally be juggling at least two telephone calls and three e-mail exchanges at once, even found a free moment to search through Rotisserie League baseball sites on the Web.</p>
        <p>Yes, New York still has a Senate race, and it still features a sitting first lady of the United States. But that has often become increasingly difficult to detect on many days in recent weeks, as aides to Mrs. Clinton and her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, have come to discover.</p>
        <p>A fog has descended over this once highest of high-flying campaigns, leaving the candidates' advisers discussing what to do about it, if anything, because it remains a matter of debate in both campaigns whether all this attention was ever a good thing for either candidate.</p>
        <p>If aides to Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton agree on anything, it is that voters (and, not incidentally, other politicians and the news media) have lost, at least for the time being, some of their fascination with a contest that for so long had seemed the political equivalent of the O. J. Simpson trial.</p>
        <p>And who can blame them?</p>
        <p>First, and most obviously, with Mr. Giuliani gone, this race is very different from what it was just a few weeks ago. If Mr. Giuliani was brash, cunning, sometimes intemperate and almost always interesting, Mr. Lazio is cautious and tentative, heeding campaign advisers who have urged that he learn the lay of the land and avoid the provocative statements that Mr. Giuliani relished. This makes the candidate Lazio less like Mr. Giuliani and more like, well, Mrs. Clinton, with a not-surprising result that comes from having two candidates intent on avoiding controversy.</p>
        <p>But the new cast of this contest is only part of it. New Yorkers have been drowning in politicking for what seems like years now. Aides to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio suspect that a fatigue has crept over an electorate that can be forgiven for feeling oversaturated.</p>
        <p>This campaign for the Senate started almost as soon as the last one ended, in November 1998, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced that he would not seek re-election. Mrs. Clinton has been talking and listening her way across New York since last July. Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have been making daily policy pronouncements and attacks from the moment each emerged as his party's presumptive presidential nominee in March. The United States Senate race in New Jersey, one of that state's most combative and closely watched campaigns in decades, has thrown a few more voices into the political din, at least in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>It doesn't help that there are only so many issues to go around, and it does seem as if Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Gore, Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush are reading off the findings of the same focus groups. Can anyone be faulted  for losing track of whether it is Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Gore who is denouncing the ''risky'' Republican Social Security or tax plan, or whether it is Mr. Bush or Mr. Lazio blaming the Clinton administration for skyrocketing fuel costs or high taxes?</p>
        <p>''The problem with the campaigns is that they started so long ago,'' Steve Gold, 49, who was eating lunch outdoors at Bryant Park in Manhattan the other afternoon, said dismissively.</p>
        <p>Kirsten Henri, a 24-year-old writer from Chelsea, put it a little more pungently. ''The campaign,'' she said, ''is boring.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Wolfson discovered, press phone calls to both campaigns are, generally speaking, markedly down. So are the requests to the campaigns for guests for the Sunday morning network talk shows, which once paid nearly as much attention to the Senate race in New York as they did to the presidential contest.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign events, while still unwieldy by the standards of a normal New York state race, no longer have the overwhelming feeling of a full-scale spectacle, with chattering television crews from across the world competing with Washington-based network correspondents for the chance to ask the first lady a question.</p>
        <p>Although the candidates have been talking -- Mrs. Clinton has some sort of event almost every day -- there is little evidence that the voters are listening. In a Quinnipiac University poll released on June 7, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio were tied, 44 percent to 44 percent. Last week, after a month in which Mrs. Clinton had been attacking Mr. Lazio for one thing or another almost every day, in speeches and with television advertisements, another Quinnipiac poll was released. The result? Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio were tied, 45 percent to 45 percent.</p>
        <p>At Jones Beach on Long Island the other day, the mere mention of what was once viewed as the race of the century drew long stares and yawns from people who had obviously found a better way to pass a hot July afternoon. ''It's, like, summertime,'' said John Cooper, 23, of Wheatley Heights, N.Y. ''People are not interested.''</p>
        <p>Up the beach, Colleen McGrath, 39, from Nesconset, N.Y., seconded that sentiment as she sat on a blanket, drinking soda and keeping an eye on her two small children. ''It gets played out after a while,'' she said. ''After a while, you don't want to hear it anymore.''</p>
        <p>What has happened, really, is that the race for Senate in New York is becoming normal. This is the way it is supposed to be. Summertime is hibernation time in most campaigns, which candidates use to raise money and try out their fall campaign themes, preferably without too much attention.</p>
        <p>In the race for president, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each decided to campaign as if Election Day were a week away as soon as the nomination was secure, and not risk yielding the stage to his opponent. But Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani made no such choice: they could not escape public attention if they tried, and they did try, concerned from the start that too much attention was not good for two candidates who were so polarizing.</p>
        <p>It is, of course, the departure of Mr. Giuliani -- and the entrance of what many Republicans have concluded is the more politically conventional and less dynamic Mr. Lazio -- that more than anything accounts for the quick and striking shift of tone.</p>
        <p>Part of this reflects what Mr. Lazio is. As a member of Congress from Suffolk County, as opposed to the chief executive of the nation's premier city, Mr. Lazio does not have the captive press corps or City Hall platform that Mr. Giuliani used to drive coverage of the Senate race. Mr. Lazio, by contrast, spent much of last week 300 miles away from New York, in Washington, casting little-noticed votes in Congress.</p>
        <p>But much of this change is a reflection of the style and relative experience of the man who entered the race after Mr. Giuliani's diagnosis of prostate cancer. One Republican leader, after nervously commenting on Mr. Lazio's sometimes rocky entrance into the Senate campaign, suggested that Mr. Lazio, who has never before run for statewide office, could benefit from a little more practice and a little less attention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's advisers disagree with that assessment of the candidate's skills, though they do seem to be taking that advice. Mike Murphy, Mr. Lazio's senior strategist, said the lull played to Mr. Lazio's benefit. ''The Lazio campaign is very happy with the current tempo of the campaign,'' he said. ''Mrs. Clinton is slowly sinking, and Lazio is slowly coming up. I don't think the media is hyperventilating any more, which is good for America.''</p>
        <p>At Mrs. Clinton's headquarters, even Mr. Wolfson sounded a bit relieved. ''I think it's fine that it no longer feels that the whole world is watching,'' he said. ''It feels more like a normal Senate campaign.'' After all, if Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton kept going at it the way Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani had, what on earth could be left to say after Labor Day, once the campaign really starts?</p>
