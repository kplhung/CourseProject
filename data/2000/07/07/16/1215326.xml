        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>Your column strikes me as racist and culturally ignorant. Your basic premise is, Shouldn't we in ''genteel'' northern Westchester have refuge from vulgarity, etc. To me there is no ''comfortable monochrome of suburbia,'' just a distressingly antiquated society where nonwhites are held less than equal by affluent whites, many of whom are still reaping the economic and cultural benefits of unfair advantage in previous decades.</p>

        <p>You snidely call the rapper spouting obscenities in earshot of your daughter an ''artiste,'' and mention that you can't understand most of what he's saying. You seem to make a mistake common to whites ignorant  of rap culture -- equating the rapper with his persona in a song. Did it ever occur to you that if you lived in a more diverse area, you might gain an understanding of and maybe even an appreciation for rap?</p>
        <p>Where's your tirade against, say, HBO, where your daughter can hear the same words, and see portrayals of violence that rappers can only describe, any time you're not tending the remote? Where's your tirade against the real problem -- racism and a society that's still far from equal?</p>
