        <p>IN beat-up pickup trucks and station wagons, in sedans and four-by-four's and sports cars, the correction officers are coming to work at the Westchester County Jail. The heat is already oppressive as the line stretches along the Grasslands Reservation here at 6:45 a.m. The officers drive through an opening in a 15-foot-high, double-chain-link fence, past Officer John West, who has been waving his colleagues through this point of freedom for the last nine years.</p>
        <p>''The public doesn't perceive us as being anything important,''  Officer West said. But, he added, ''We're doing life at eight hours a day,'' speaking of the frustration he has observed among the officers in this daily convoy and of their reluctance at times to come to work.</p>
        <p>Because of a stalemate over a clause in their contract, the officers have not had a pay raise in almost five years. Their union, the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, is at odds with County Executive Andrew J. Spano over a new labor pact. (The union for the jail supervisors, the Superior Officers Association, has also been without a contract or a pay raise since the end of 1995.)</p>
        <p>At the heart of the contract dispute is a lucrative perquisite that enables officers to put themselves on disability without first having to prove any injury. Often they can remain out of work for months before a hearing is held. The county executive calls the policy bizarre because workers can walk off the job unquestioned. Robert Goodstein, the lawyer for the union, says that it is similar to what most civilian employees receive through worker's compensation and that it is essential in such a dangerous business.</p>
        <p>There are 770 officers and 123 supervisors and of those about 506 work in the jail in any 24-hour period. As many as 101 officers a day report that they are injured and cannot come to work. That leaves others to handle double shifts of often forced overtime in an environment that is home to 1,300 accused and convicted criminals: killers and con men, bank robbers, rapists, drug dealers, petty thieves and prostitutes. The complex includes a county jail for men who are being detained before trial, awaiting sentencing or awaiting transfer; a penitentiary for men who have been sentenced to a term of a year or less; and a unit for women in both categories.</p>
        <p>In 1997, more than 35 percent of the work force, or 289 officers, claimed job injury. In 1998, that number decreased slightly. And as of three weeks ago, barely halfway through the year, 83 officers had been out for more than 30 days with an injury.</p>
        <p>''They are claiming they are hurt on the job when they are not,'' Larry S. Schwartz, Mr. Spano's chief adviser, said. ''Or, they are claiming they are still hurt when they can come back to work because they are saying, 'We can get free money.' ''</p>
        <p>The number of injury claims far exceeds that of any other similarly sized county in New York State, according to a report two years ago by a task force commissioned by Mr. Spano, which called the situation out of control. By comparison, the study found that 30 officers claimed job injury in Nassau County in 1997; 95 in Albany County, 66 in Onondaga and 17 in Erie.</p>
        <p>Ned Benton, chairman of the department of public management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he had worked with 50 correction systems in half the states in the United States and had never heard of a similar disability clause in a labor agreement. Neither has Mel Grieshaber, the immediate past president of the International Association of Correction Officers.</p>
        <p>County officials believe some officers may be abusing the injury policy to try to exact a form of revenge on their employer for lack of a contract. Eight officers have been arrested in the past year on grand larceny and other felony charges because they were suspected of faking job injuries to collect tax-free salaries. One of those cases has been dismissed. Resolution of the other cases is pending.</p>
        <p>But Joseph K. Spano, the president of the correction officers union, who is not related to County Executive Spano, said the county is trying to break the union's back at the negotiating table, eliminating a contract clause that the previous county administration respected.</p>
        <p>''It is a disgrace the way they have made us look in the public view,'' Joseph Spano, speaking of the administration, said from a seat in his union office in Hawthorne. ''This is a strategic attack on us. It was designed to punish us, initially, for not supporting the county executive, and then it just rolled over to having us succumb at the negotiation table. It didn't happen and it is not going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, the county executive's adviser, said that in fact his boss believes that the majority of the correction officers use  the injury policy correctly, relying on it for protection in a brutal climate where fistfights and stabbings can break out at any minute. But, he said, the county executive  will not put up with wrongdoing. .</p>
        <p>''When Andy Spano became county executive, a new sheriff came to town, and that sheriff said, 'I am not going to stand for any officer stealing taxpayer money,' '' Mr. Schwartz said. ''A lot of good officers are cheering us on, that it is about time to stop these guys ripping off the system.''</p>
        <p>Officer disability claims are made under the state's General Municipal Law, which provides a full salary in addition to medical and hospital expenses for duty-related injuries or illnesses. The Internal Revenue Service has ruled that those benefits are not taxable. Where Westchester differs from other counties in the state is in the presumption, written into the contract, that an officer's claims are valid from the day an injury report is filed.</p>
        <p>Largely as a result of this contract rule -- negotiated in March 1989 by the administration of former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke -- the county has exceeded its jail overtime budget by $24 million over the past decade. It has also spent $80,000 a year since 1997 in legal expenses fighting to get officers who are out under the job-injury clause back to work. In addition, the county spent $76,000 last year to pay arbitrators; thousands of dollars more go for investigation, surveillance and other expenses.</p>
        <p>Union officials say the overtime bill results from many factors, not just the disability clause. And, in any case, they say, the solution to the injury issue is not complicated: the county should haul officers into hearings more quickly and provide quicker trips to the doctor. Capt. Charles Spencer, of the jail's attendance management unit, said 16 job injury hearings are scheduled in a good month and the county tries to get officers to visit its doctors within a week of injury. Since January, 69 hearings have been scheduled, Captain Spencer said.</p>
        <p>But Scott Delfa, the union's second vice president, said the county initiates ''maybe three to seven'' hearings a month and officers sometimes wait weeks to visit the county's independent doctor. Some hearings take more than a week, while others take only hours. Many times officers who file job injury claims return to work, either on full or limited duty, before hearings begin.</p>
        <p>As a result, there is never a finding of fact about the injury, and either way there is no provision for the county to recover any back pay. Sometimes officers who are forced to return to work simply claim another injury or a relapse days later, county officials said.</p>
        <p>Half of officer injuries result from contact with inmates, Captain Spencer said, and the majority of those are for neck, back and shoulder injuries and torn ligaments, twisted knees and ankles. Last year, one correction officer was injured when assaulted by an inmate; this year there have been three assault cases. Included in other claims are some for psychological stress, slipping in the parking lot or falling off chairs.</p>
        <p>As the guards try to make the case for the new contract they want, they do so in the face of a wave of bad publicity.</p>
        <p>In addition to the eight arrests for job injury fraud, 16 other officers have been arrested since last July on charges including the rape of female inmates, bribery, attempting to bring vodka and cigarettes into the jail and the running of an illegal moneymaking game known as a cash pyramid scheme from behind its walls.</p>
        <p>Two of them, Bradley Belcher and Yvette Washington, pleaded guilty to narcotics charges in Federal District Court in White Plains on June 28 and now face up to 15 years as prisoners themselves, Mary Jo White, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said.</p>
        <p>After the arrests of four male officers on a variety of sex-abuse charges -- including raping female inmates or forcing them to strip for medications -- Mr. Spano, the county executive, decided that only women could guard the female prisoners' housing blocks, a policy that was carried out only in part because of staff shortages related to the job injury problem. The union sued the county in federal court once the policy took effect in February.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said there was reasonable cause to believe the county's move ''unlawfully discriminated on the basis of gender.'' The commission suggested that video surveillance could solve the problems, but Alan D. Scheinkman, the Westchester County attorney, said he strongly disagrees with that recommendation, because it raises other privacy issues.</p>
        <p>At least 10 officers, including some who were not working under the injury clause, have been criminally charged in incidents outside the lockup, officials said. Another  officer was murdered while working as a bouncer at a New York City nightclub in February 1999, seven months after going out of work with an injury, said Mr. Schwartz.</p>
        <p>Headlines about these cases distract from the union's efforts to call attention to its side of the story. A list of the union's state and federal litigations and grievances against the county and the jail administration is four pages long. Also a suit recently filed by a group of black sergeants against the Westchester Department of Correction alleges that a pattern of racism has prevented the promotion of black officers at the jail.</p>
        <p>In addition, a group of former union leaders has been highly critical of the current regime. If the dissenters gather enough signatures and file a petition with the state's Public Employees Relation Board seeking a de-certification vote, it could derail contract talks for up to four years while the matter is litigated, said Mr. Spano, the current union head.</p>
        <p>Most of those interviewed said morale among the 770 correction officers and 123 supervisors inside the complex is at an all-time low. Officers often find themselves working 16-hour shifts or 80-hour weeks to cover for colleagues who either cannot or do not come to work. While some relish the overtime pay, most say they have had enough. Mr. Spano, the union chief, said that after being forced to work overtime, officers are likely to call in sick or exhausted, which leads to more overtime for others.</p>
        <p>County Executive Spano said he was aware that some officers did not like the overtime, but said, ''At this time we have no information that it is unsafe'' in the jail.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Charles E. Albert, the director of pastoral care, said he often heard the officers' concerns as he made his rounds in the jail. '' 'Chaplain,' they will say, 'I'm feeling depressed. I'm feeling burnt out. I've worked four doubles this week, and I'm at my wit's end'.''</p>
        <p>On that morning late last month when Officer West stood sentry, waving his colleagues past the razor-wire-topped checkpoint on the jail perimeter, he had already worked an 11 p.m.-to-7 a.m. shift. He sipped coffee to stay alert for another eight hours.</p>
        <p>Past him, through two sets of locking metal doors that seal shut one after another, Sgt. Beth Ehren often puts in a 16-hour day  at Central Control. Her eyes darted along a bank of video monitors that showed live shots of different corners in the jail.</p>
        <p>Beyond her, Officer Joseph DeYorio logged prisoners out of Central Booking, beginning his fifth straight 16-hour shift. Later, he would have to strip-search dozens of inmates returning from court, looking for weapons, drugs or other contraband. He acknowledged how his colleagues had put him here, saying the job injury claims are ''a little out of hand.''</p>
        <p>Deeper and deeper into the jail, the so-called house of doors, officers at many of the jail's 439 posts are being forced to work long hours in what they say are dangerous jobs. Some blame the administration for not policing their ranks more strictly. Others find fault with certain colleagues, the few bad apples in the bunch. Most say something has got to give. And soon.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anyone is that enthusiastic about coming in here, and this makes it even more bitter, knowing your chances of going home can sometimes be slim,'' said Larry Joyner, an officer who has never called in injured in his 10-year career. ''I've never seen it this bad before.''</p>
        <p>Officer Joyner speaks low so the inmates can't hear. He is behind a set of steel bars in Two West, a labyrinthine section of the jail constructed in 1933. This is the so-called ''max-max'' section, which houses male inmates facing serious criminal charges or those who might try to escape, a place where, as Officer Joyner is well aware,  violence could erupt at any minute.</p>
        <p>Last year there were 153 inmate-on-inmate assaults at the jail, said Joseph A. Miranda Jr., the chief of operations at the jail. These are, of course, fights that the correction officers must break up. In other cases, the officers are the target, finding themselves drenched in urine and hit by  feces flung at them from behind the bars.  Still other assaults are psychological. Three inmates committed suicide in the jail last year, and it is the guards who must gently  lower the prisoners' bodies and untie the  makeshift nooses.</p>
        <p>One inmate, Reginald Gousse, a 27-year-old who said he is charged with robbery,  said that he knows about the officers' labor dispute and that he has sympathy for them, especially since they keep him safe too.</p>
        <p>''They work hard,'' said Mr. Gousse, who has been in the jail 15 months. ''This is a hostile place. ''I think they should get a new contract.''</p>
        <p>Other inmates are considerably less charitable about the officers' troubles, particularly their run-in's with the law.</p>
        <p>Who are the real drug dealers? they shout from their cells. Who is getting collared now?</p>
        <p>The outcome of the contract negotiations is uncertain. The county executive will say only that negotiations with the union are continuing. Rocco A. Pozzi, correction commissioner, said he wanted the benefit clause revised. Mr. Spano, the union head, said that  the sides are extremely close to agreeing to a contract proposal, primarily because he is willing to modify the job-injury clause, though he declined to release details.</p>
        <p>''We'll put in checkpoints to make it difficult, if not impossible, for somebody to abuse the system, but we are going to keep some protection in place,'' Mr. Spano, the union head, said.</p>
        <p>A formal agreement would be subject to a vote by the rank and file. A mediator has been brought in, said Mr. Goodstein, the lawyer for the union. Also at stake are issues including pay raises, longevity and retirement benefits, he said. The annual base salary for correction officers with four years' experience is $47,050. Sergeants are paid $55,000 a year, captains get $64,000 and assistant wardens are paid $72,000, said Robert J. Buckley, the head of the union for supervisors.</p>
        <p>Back out at the front gate, Officer West said no amount of money could ever be enough for correction officers.</p>
        <p>''You never know from day to day if you are going to get assaulted inside or what is going to happen,'' he said. ''You live with it. Day to day.''</p>
