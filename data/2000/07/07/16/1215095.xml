      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A white man sings in an all-black gospel choir, for fun and spiritual connection. A group of Mexican immigrants learns to make sushi Korean-style. A black corporate lawyer fights with her sister because, now middle class, she is no longer black enough. A redheaded teenager finds himself by becoming Chinese.</p>
        <p>Here, at the end of the six-week New York Times series ''How Race Is Lived in America,'' we remove the journalistic filter and offer an issue of unmediated words and images. Public figures and private citizens talk about how race affects their lives: there are documentary pictures with commentary by the subjects (an enlarged version of our weekly What They Were Thinking feature); memoirs (an expanded Lives, including an extended tale of growing up biracial); a portfolio featuring prominent people who are in a minority at work, another portraying relationships that endure despite difference; a round-table discussion with Times editors and writers who, in an unusual bout of public self-examination, discuss what working on the series meant to them; a photo diary of two women who work side by side, yet live apart.</p>

        <p>Decades into the experiment of integration, race still infuses our quotidian interactions, remaining a source of misunderstanding and enlightenment, alienation and togetherness. In the very tangle of experiences -- rendered in these individual voices -- lies the most naked picture of ourselves.</p>
