        <p>THE building certainly does not look very glamorous. A couple of bars and meatpacking tenants occupy most of the ground floor space at 430 West 14th Street, which has a broad corrugated metal canopy mounted on it to shield workers from the weather as they load and unload trucks in the early morning hours.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Washington-based Starwood Urban Investments has paid $10.2 million for the five-story brick building with blocklong frontage on Washington Street,  between 13th and 14th Streets.</p>
        <p>The investment is the first in New York for Starwood Urban, which is a joint venture by the Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn., and Wennett Urban Retail of Washington. Starwood Urban officials say they are prepared to invest as much as $250 million over the next 12 months in retail, loft and manufacturing properties in what they describe as ''emerging chic'' areas in Manhattan like the meatpacking district, west Chelsea, Union Square, the garment district and Clinton.</p>
        <p>The far western end of 14th Street is clearly in the midst of change, even if it may not fit traditional definitions of chic. The fashionable clothing store Jeffrey shares space in a building with Moishe's Mini Storage. Art galleries like Long Fine Art and Katzen-Stein have moved into the area, but the sidewalks are still often blocked by forklifts moving foodstuffs, and the cobblestone street is obstructed by delivery trucks.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Robert S. Wennett, the president of Starwood Urban, said he sees 430 West 14th Street as a prime retail opportunity. He said the building's 200-foot frontage on Washington Street, plus 50 more feet each on 13th and 14th Streets, are ideal for restaurants or stores.</p>
        <p>''Retailers like exposure without great depth, so this is a fabulous retail building,''  Mr. Wennett said. He said the 15,800 square feet on the first floor and in the basement would be offered to tenants with high profiles and original concepts.</p>
        <p>Most of the leases of the current tenants will expire in the short term, or the tenants are already renting on a month-to-month basis, making it easy to recapture the space for new uses. ''That was part of the opportunity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said luring upscale retail tenants to what were formerly marginal neighborhoods was part of the formula for Starwood Urban, which has previously invested in Washington, South Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Fla., and Norwalk, Conn. ''We do not buy buildings in neighborhoods without retail opportunities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Starwood Urban was formed two years ago to make investments in city neighborhoods that appear to be changing for the better. ''We go into emerging areas and focus on retail and offices,'' Mr. Wennett said. ''We target areas earlier than institutional capital.''</p>
        <p>The meatpacking district of Manhattan is just such an emerging area, he said, adding that many people like working in areas that are industrial by day but filled with urban sophisticates by night, drawn by new restaurants and exotic bars. He said the area is making the transition from industrial to residential and retail in the same way that  SoHo and TriBeCa developed.</p>
        <p>He noted that Starwood Urban has an all-the-time casual dress policy and said the properties the company invests in are being developed to appeal to new-economy ventures. The company plans to spend about $1 million at 430 West 14th Street, to repair the brick facade, improve the heating and air-conditioning and to upgrade the elevators and lobby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wennett said he planned to market the 46,000 square feet on the building's upper floors to full-floor tenants or to a single large tenant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wennett said many new media and Internet workers are more concerned about lifestyle than location. ''They don't want to be in Class A office space,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Constance Collins Davis, the general counsel of Starwood Urban, said: ''Young people are coming back to cities. They want to mix art and entertainment with the work experience. We look for places where we would like to work.''</p>
        <p>The Starwood officials noted that restaurants like Markt, Pastis and Lotus have opened in the area, that a hotel is scheduled to be built a block or so away and that the Chelsea Market has become a tourist attraction nearby at Ninth Avenue and 15th Street.</p>
        <p>T HE area is moving, no doubt about it,'' said David Gmach, the executive director of the Union Square-14th Street Business Improvement District, whose western boundary is the Avenue of the Americas. ''The question is how quickly.'' He said the possibility of the area's being designated a landmark or special zoning district might influence the way it develops.</p>
        <p>He noted that some people think enough of the area to spend as much as $2 million for a condominium in a converted bank building  at 14th Street and Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>Some retail specialists say the lack of a local population base and the distance from transportation make it likely that the West 14th Street area will take a long time to emulate SoHo, if it ever does.</p>
        <p>''It took SoHo a long time to become SoHo,'' said Richard A. Seligman, the president of Retail Development Partners, a brokerage firm. ''And SoHo is bounded by two well-established retail corridors, Broadway and West Broadway.'' He said he had not received any inquiries from retailers seeking locations on or near West 14th Street. Nevertheless, Starwood officials are predicting that once renovations are complete, 430 West 14th Street will command retail rents of $80 to $100 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Robert K. Futterman of RKF Associates, another retail brokerage firm, said retail rents in the area were unlikely to exceed $50 a foot and that the most likely tenants would be restaurants and bars, rather than stores.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of buzz about the area, but it is mostly about restaurants and saloons,'' he said. ''You are not likely to see many traditional retailers in that area.''</p>
        <p>He said retail tenants seeking locations in a city look for a critical mass of population, good transportation and other stores so shoppers will be drawn to the area, all of which the West 14th Street area lacks. ''We just expanded Banana Republic at 111 Eighth Avenue,'' he said, referring to the  building that runs from 15th to 16th Streets. ''That's where the traditional retailers want to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Seligman said that for $80 to $100 a square foot, a retailer can rent space in an established shopping area and not have to wonder whether West 14th Street will develop as a daytime shopping destination, as it has as an evening eating and partying location. ''For $125 a foot a retailer can go to lower Fifth Avenue and not worry if the area is going to happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although some art galleries have moved to 14th Street, it does not have the concentration of galleries that were present in SoHo before rising rents paid by retailers drove them to other parts of the city. ''SoHo always was a cool place to walk around, but it still took 10 years for it to be transformed from an artsy New York neighborhood to an international shopping center,'' Mr. Seligman said.</p>
        <p>He added that by locating in an established retail area, ''you know who your neighbors will be, which is important when you are paying $3 million to $4 million a year in rent -- it is well known that retailers travel in packs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wennett of Starwood Urban said he was convinced that long-term trends were working in his favor, even if the short term may be uncertain. ''New York and San Francisco are the centers of the new economy,'' he said, ''and that trend is not likely to die even if Wall Street takes a dive.''</p>
        <p>He said the West 14th Street area may come to resemble European cities, where the meat and fish shops operate during the day and then give way to cafes and restaurants at night. ''That is an attractive urban fabric,'' he said, ''and we like investing in these types of neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>He also hopes some of the industrial character of the area can be preserved. ''We are not interested in turning this into a mall,'' he said. ''SoHo is a mall.''</p>
