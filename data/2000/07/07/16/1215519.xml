        <p>It will now be left to the rest of the world to try to defeat Maurice Greene and Marion Jones at 100 meters, because no one in the United States appears capable of beating the world's fastest man and woman in the most elemental and explosive of the sprints.</p>
        <p>Running into a four-mile-an-hour headwind, Greene stumbled at the start, but he is a remarkably patient and composed sprinter. He did not panic. He stayed low out of the blocks, accelerated calmly and caught his training partner Jon Drummond at about 80 meters to win easily in 10.01 seconds today at the United States Olympic track and field trials.</p>

        <p>It will now be left to the rest of the world to try to defeat Maurice Greene and Marion Jones at 100 meters, because no one in the United States appears capable of beating the world's fastest man and woman in the most elemental and explosive of the sprints.</p>
        <p>Running into a four-mile-an-hour headwind, Greene stumbled at the start, but he is a remarkably patient and composed sprinter. He did not panic. He stayed low out of the blocks, accelerated calmly and caught his training partner Jon Drummond at about 80 meters to win easily in 10.01 seconds today at the United States Olympic track and field trials.</p>
        <p>''It was a terrible start, but I kept my composure,'' said Greene, the world record-holder in 9.79 seconds. ''I've been in enough big races to know that if I stay calm and let everything unfold by itself, it's going to be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Jones left the blocks smoothly with Gail Devers, the two-time Olympic champion at 100 meters, who held the lead for 50 meters. But no one has the speed or power to stay with Jones in the second half of a 100-meter race. She reeled Devers in at about 60 meters and crossed the finish line first in 10.88 seconds, the second-fastest time in the world this year. It was especially impressive because she was running into a two-mile-an-hour wind.</p>
        <p>''I made the Olympic team,'' the ebullient Greene said in a sing-song voice as he met with reporters. He also put his T-shirt over his face and appeared to be crying. Four years ago he was a little-known sprinter who exited from the trials early with a sore hamstring muscle. He watched the Atlanta Olympics in the stands, tears in his eyes, determined that the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, would not proceed without him.</p>
        <p>He will have familiar company in Sydney. Tonight's second-place finisher, Curtis Johnson (10.06), and third-place sprinter, Drummond (10.07), are his training partners under Coach John Smith in Los Angeles. Not only will Greene be at the Games in September, but he will also be the prohibitive favorite to win a gold medal.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid, I looked at TV and said, 'I can be there someday; I can win that,' '' said Greene, who grew up in Kansas City, Kan. ''Now the time is here. It's time to finish what I've always dreamed of.''</p>
        <p>Jones, a native of Los Angeles, watched on television the 1984 Summer Games in her hometown and wrote on a chalkboard, ''I want to be an Olympic champion.'' Still in high school, she qualified for the 1992 Summer Olympics on the sprint relay, but declined the invitation. Tonight she assertively made the American team in an individual event, finishing well ahead of Inger Miller (11.05) and Chryste Gaines (11.13). Devers faded to fifth in the final meters in 11.14.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long 17 years going at this thing called track and field,'' said Jones, who is 24. ''When I was 8, I dreamed of making the Olympic team. Finally, the dream came true. But I don't plan to stop there. I'm not satisfied just being on the team.''</p>
        <p>It is her plan to win five gold medals in Sydney, and on Sunday she will confront her weakest event, the long jump, against her idol, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has come out of retirement to try to make her fifth Olympic team. If the long jump is in doubt, the 100 meters is not. Jones has not lost a footrace since 1997 and has been ranked No. 1 in the world the past three years.</p>
        <p>''My goal is to go to Sydney and win every event I'm entered in,'' Jones said. ''Everyone is tired of hearing it, but I think I'm capable of doing it.''</p>
        <p>The most exciting and suspenseful event at today's trials involved Jones's husband, C. J. Hunter, in the shot put. All three medalists threw their personal bests and reveled in their success by leaping into one another's arms as the packed crowd at Sacramento State University applauded wildly. Adam Nelson took first on his final attempt with a toss of 72 feet 7 inches, the ninth-longest throw in history and undoubtedly the longest throw ever by an Ivy League graduate. Nelson, a 1997 graduate of Dartmouth, credited his success to a recent leave from his job at a software company.</p>
        <p>''I get to sleep in late and eat fruit,'' he said. ''That helps a lot.''</p>
        <p>Hunter, the current world champion, threw his personal best, 71-9, but, unlike his wife, he had to settle for second place. It did not matter, Hunter said. Andy Bloom took third on his final throw, 70-10 3/4 and Hunter gave him a congratulatory bearhug.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if I don't win any meets as long as I win the Games,'' Hunter said. ''That's all that matters to me.''</p>
        <p>In another event decided today, Dawn Ellerbe of Brooklyn won the women's hammer throw with a toss of 227 feet. The event will be contested for the first time at the Games in Sydney, and Ellerbe is considered a candidate for a bronze medal.</p>
        <p>Entering the trials, there had been new questions raised about Greene's vulnerability. Last year he lost only one race at 100 meters, indoors or out. But he lost three times already this young season, finishing fourth in a race in Athens and fifth in Glasgow, running a time -- 10.54 seconds -- that he had not run since high school. These were merely training races, Greene insisted, and today he erased all the uncertainty about his fitness.</p>
        <p>If Greene needed more motivation, he got it from a columnist who happens to be his main challenger in the 200-meter race next Sunday: the Olympic champion and world-record holder Michael Johnson.</p>
        <p>In a column written on Friday in USA Today, the usually taciturn Johnson criticized Greene's European jaunt in late June and early July. Earlier this season Johnson called Greene immature and said that he did not believe the ostentatious Greene was properly respectful about Johnson's achievements.</p>
        <p>''Greene has been inconsistent this season,'' Johnson wrote. ''He has run a lot of races, which is not smart.''</p>
        <p>Johnson also criticized one of Greene's training partners, Miller, who also struggled in Europe, writing that he believed she would have a ''tough time'' making the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>''Where is Michael Johnson? That's what I want to know,'' Miller said after tonight's race. Referring to Johnson's new hairstyle of tight curls, Miller said: ''Maybe he ought to untwist those beads in his head. They're too tight.''</p>
        <p>Told what Miller had said about Johnson, Greene said, ''Maybe he'll get some sense if he does.''</p>
        <p>This war of words will most likely continue through next Sunday's 200-meter final. Clearly, though, Johnson's dismissal of Greene's training group, known as Hudson Smith International, was premature. Including Miller, the H.S.I. training group accounted for four of the six Olympic spots won today in the 100 meters.</p>
        <p>''I think Mr. Johnson has given the troops the spark they needed,'' said Emanuel Hudson, the agent for the group.</p>
