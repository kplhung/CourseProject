        <p>Residents of Sedona, Ariz., have banded together to put their town on the artistic map with an ambitious cultural park of more than 50 acres. Ten years in the making and still a work in progress (over $8 million has been raised so far), the Sedona Cultural Park aims to meld nature conservation, arts education and cultural events.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the park is its hillside amphitheater, the Georgia Frontiere Performing Arts Pavilion, (800) 780-2787, which opened on May 26 with a performance by the Phoenix Symphony. The design, by Jensvold-Thompson Architects, a California firm, features three wooden arches that rise 60 feet above the stage and frame not only the cultural action but also a view beyond  to Boynton Canyon and red rock formations, including Capital Butte. Its backers hope the spot will become a summer home to orchestral performances, theater, and folk and jazz concerts; this summer's schedule includes six weeks of theater by Shakespeare Sedona ending July 30, and an outdoor Jazz on the Rocks Festival on Sept. 23.</p>

        <p>The park also houses the Red Rock Information Center, which, in cooperation with the United States Forest Service, will help introduce visitors to the natural surroundings, including the hiking trails of the adjacent Coconino National Forest. The park's Center for Education and the Arts, a partnership of Arizona colleges, universities and school districts, is developing a range of on-site and in-school programs. Eventually planned, should money allow, is an arts village that would be home to galleries, restaurants, studios, museums and indoor performance stages.</p>
