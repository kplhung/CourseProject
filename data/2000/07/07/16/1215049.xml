        <p>Education of a Felon</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Edward Bunker.</p>
        <p>St. Martin's, $25.95.</p>
        <p>If ever there were a case against institutionalizing wayward children -- and for feeding their minds with books -- it would be Edward Bunker's. After his parents' divorce in 1938, the-5-year-old Edward was sent to a boarding house for boys in his native Los Angeles. Lonely and angry, he ran away; it was the first of many escapes that prompted his father to turn him over to the juvenile authorities, where harsh treatment and thuggish pals groomed him for a life of crime. At 17, he became the youngest inmate at the time in San Quentin. Bunker writes in straight-ahead, unadorned prose and, refreshingly, he refrains from excessive psychologizing and sentimentalizing. ''Education of a Felon'' is somewhat disorganized, possibly because of the sheer volume of wild experiences Bunker has to wrangle; for example, by 18 he had a fire hose turned on him by a guard, was beaten nearly to death in a state hospital by attendants and had attacked a death row killer with a knife. He credits reading with his salvation, his window onto worlds not peopled by the pimps, whores and hoods he ran with. Another great help to him was Louise Wallis, the wife of the Hollywood producer Hal Wallis. Bunker called her ''mom''; she bailed him out of jail and bought him a typewriter when he expressed interest in writing. The book ends, in fact, when he gets a phone call in prison from an agent who has sold Bunker's seventh novel (the first six were never published). This is a rough-hewn memoir by a rough-hewn man.</p>
