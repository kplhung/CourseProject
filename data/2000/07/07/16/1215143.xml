        <p>THREE years ago, Robert M. MacPherson, a developer, was looking for some land on the Interstate 395 corridor in Norwich, Conn., for a Home Depot, but after repeated visits had found no parcel that was suitable in terms of size and location.</p>
        <p>''On my way home one night I saw this big tract of land right off the highway exit ramp a mile outside the Norwich city limits,'' Mr. MacPherson recalled. The 113-acre cornfield had more than a third of a mile of frontage on Route 12 and sloped down to the Norwich and Worcester Railroad tracks and the Quinebaug River in the back. ''It was just what I was looking for,'' Mr. MacPherson said.</p>

        <p>THREE years ago, Robert M. MacPherson, a developer, was looking for some land on the Interstate 395 corridor in Norwich, Conn., for a Home Depot, but after repeated visits had found no parcel that was suitable in terms of size and location.</p>
        <p>''On my way home one night I saw this big tract of land right off the highway exit ramp a mile outside the Norwich city limits,'' Mr. MacPherson recalled. The 113-acre cornfield had more than a third of a mile of frontage on Route 12 and sloped down to the Norwich and Worcester Railroad tracks and the Quinebaug River in the back. ''It was just what I was looking for,'' Mr. MacPherson said.</p>
        <p>That was the genesis of Lisbon Landing, a $50 million, 500,000-square-foot retail complex scheduled to open in stages starting in February in the rural town of Lisbon. Besides Home Depot, it will have a Super Wal-Mart store, a Kohl's department store, an Old Navy, Linen 'N' Things, and at least one restaurant. ''We were pretty well leased up by the time we finished with our local permits,'' Mr. MacPherson said.</p>
        <p>Although the initial plan included space for a theater, the developer is now considering converting that space to retail as well since all the other retail space filled so quickly. Because retail space requires fewer parking spaces than a theater, that would allow the project to expand to 550,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Gottlieb, director of marketing for WS Development Associates of Chestnut Hill, Mass., a co-developer, said what interested his company in the site was its easy access to, and visibility from, the highway.</p>
        <p>''We also see the area as one that's going to benefit from a lot of residential development over the next few years, which made it even more attractive,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. ''This area is really underserved by retail now, so this was quite an opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Thomas W. Sparkman, Lisbon's first selectman, said he expected the Route 12  site to become the center for additional development. ''I think it's a foregone conclusion that it's going to be an anchor for more  development, not only in Lisbon but in neighboring Griswold and Jewett City,'' Mr. Sparkman said. ''There are going to be stores that are going to want to attach themselves to a project like this, and they'll find property and develop close to it.''</p>
        <p>James D. Rabbitt, the Lisbon town planner, said that the property's attractiveness to developers gave local officials some leverage in the final site plan.</p>
        <p>''Wal-Mart will not be its traditional blue, gray and red -- it's going to be tan and green, with peaked roofs and vestibules and landscaping in front of the building,'' Mr. Rabbitt said.</p>
        <p>Keith T. Morris, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, said the discount department store chain had begun to take a less rigid approach to its store design throughout the Northeast, based on surveys showing that people felt more strongly about stores' meeting local design standards in the region.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to lose our corporate identity, but there are a lot of things we can do to fit into the local communities,'' Mr. Morris said. ''The last six months or so, we've been moving away from the sort of cookie cutter design.''</p>
        <p>He said that at the Lisbon site in particular it seemed worthwhile to go along with local planners because of the lack of retail space -- Lisbon does not have a bank branch, clothing store, cleaner, photo shop or pharmacy. And, he said, Wal-Mart is hopeful that the Lisbon store will take some pressure off its Norwich operation a few miles to the south, which has seen traffic beyond what was anticipated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rabbitt said the town won other design concessions on the project. Home Depot agreed to rules that will limit its displays out front, the whole site will be planted with almost 1,000 12-  to 15-foot trees and thousands of shrubs, and a 33-acre piece between the railroad tracks and the river will be conveyed to the town for open space, Mr. Rabbitt said.</p>
        <p>He said that there were almost 200 additional acres to the north of Interstate 395 and smaller parcels to the west of Route 12 that would likely come under some development pressure once Lisbon Landing was built, and that the town wanted a project that would set the right tone for anything to follow.</p>
        <p>The site formerly sloped down to the river, but the developers built a $2.5 million retaining wall up to 35 feet tall along the back of the property, moving 500,000 cubic yards of fill on the site so that most of the 76 acres being developed will be flat. As laid out, Lisbon Landing will face away from the river.</p>
        <p>T HE way the site is configured, it would have been very difficult to do it any other way,'' Mr. Rabbitt said. The only way to take advantage of the waterfront vista would have been to turn the whole complex toward the river, he said, ''and I would have been jumping up and down about that because I don't want people driving by on Route 12 to see 1,700 feet of plain block wall.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacPherson, whose development company is the Cape Breton Corporation in Braintree, Mass., brought in Home Depot for 118,000 square feet of space, as well as an associated 700-square-foot tool rental center and 18,000-square-foot garden center. WS Development convinced Wal-Mart to take almost 184,000 square feet of space for a combination grocery and discount department store.</p>
        <p>With those two in place, the team planned to use the rest of the space for various small retail shops and restaurants, but before long Kohl's Department Stores agreed to take almost 90,000 square feet of space, and a restaurant and the theater are now being considered for additional retail space.</p>
        <p>The project will pay $525,000 a year in taxes after five years, which will increase the town's tax rolls by about 16 percent, and it is expected to create 600 jobs. Mr. MacPherson said that he was still getting calls from potential tenants even though the project was almost fully leased and that he was considering additional development on some of the adjoining acreage.</p>
        <p>Although so-called category killer stores often face opposition in small towns, the permitting process for Lisbon Landing went smoothly. The town authorized the use of $4.8 million in state and federal grants to build sewer and water lines for the project and some other land along Route 12, and the groundbreaking two months ago was attended by a crowd of local officials and residents who have supported it.</p>
        <p>If someone had come in and put up a nondescript, prefabricated building, ''people would be upset,'' Mr. Rabbitt said, adding, ''But with the landscaping and architectural touches, this is something that will give you the appearance of a downtown.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sparkman, the first selectman, said: ''I think everybody realized the project was going to be a benefit. Even the people who are in business now and might see some  competition that a project like this will bring to the area saw it would also bring increased traffic, and they're not going to lose their niche.''</p>
        <p>Philip E. Anthony, who with his brother, Ronald C. Anthony, owns Anthony Hardware a few miles up Route 12 in Jewett City, said that he expected an impact there for a year from the project because of the curiosity about Home Depot but that after that things would likely settle back.</p>
        <p>''No big box can ever provide the kind of one-on-one service we do, and that's the reason we've been here for 50 years,'' Philip Anthony said. ''We've seen other big shops come and go, and we're still here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anthony said even if the project was wildly successful, his family would benefit because it also owned 49 acres on Route 12 a few hundred yards from Lisbon Landing. ''We've already gotten calls from as far away as Arizona from people wanting to purchase that property,'' Mr. Anthony said.</p>
        <p>Raymond R. Welch, who owns Welch Theaters, a twin-screen movie house in Jewett City, said he first had concerns about the project three years ago.</p>
        <p>''We had a bank pretty much lined up to finance a three-screen theater on Main Street, but they backed out and I was told it was because there was a big theater planned for Lisbon Landing and they were worried about the competition,'' Mr. Welch said.</p>
        <p>''Now that they've said they're not going to build the theater, if I could raise the money, I wouldn't mind putting a theater over near there, because that's where all the people are going to be.''</p>
