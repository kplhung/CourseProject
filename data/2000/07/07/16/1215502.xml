        <p>If Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's political future were still as bright as it once was, the photo showing her grinning as she frisked a young black man might have done some real damage.</p>
        <p>Black lawmakers and clergymen expressed outrage this week over the photo, taken when Mrs. Whitman accompanied state troopers on patrol in Camden in 1996, and the Rev. Al Sharpton seized on it as proof of the governor's racial insensitivity. But what was perhaps most striking about the furor that followed its recent publication was how little of an effect it was likely to have on Mrs. Whitman's political standing.</p>
        <p>''The thing about it is, her term's almost over, and she's never running for anything else again,'' predicted Charles E. Cook Jr., editor of the Cook Political Report, a Washington newsletter. ''So what difference does it make?''</p>
        <p>The governor's allies, predictably, argued that Mrs. Whitman would emerge unscathed because she  quickly admitted that her pat-down of the man, who had already been searched by troopers and who was not arrested, had been a mistake -- though that argument seemed unpersuasive, as she resisted growing demands that she apologize to the man.</p>
        <p>The governor, who said through a spokeswoman that she had frisked the man because she had wanted to experience what police officers face,  endured two days of criticism and even ridicule by television commentators and late-night comedians. But the videotaped beating of a carjacking suspect by 10 Philadelphia police officers on Wednesday quickly shifted attention to a far uglier law enforcement confrontation with its own racial overtones.</p>
        <p>The most telling commentary about the governor's gaffe, however, may have been the silence of most New Jersey Democratic leaders, who seemed to have nothing to say about it. No faxed attacks, no breathless phone calls to reporters, no slogans shouted from the State House steps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton was hardly alone, of course, in suggesting that the photograph was so problematic that it could cost Mrs. Whitman a spot on the Republican presidential ticket with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ''They say a picture is worth a thousand words,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''It might be worth a vice-presidential nomination.''</p>
        <p>But what the photo really brought into focus was how far Mrs. Whitman's political star had fallen since the picture was taken in 1996. Back then she was at the height of her celebrity, the best known of the wave of moderate Republican governors elected in 1993 and 1994. A year earlier, she had been asked to deliver the Republican response to the State of the Union address; in 1996 she was on Bob Dole's short list of potential running mates, and she was considered a likely presidential candidate in 2000 should he lose.</p>
        <p>Today, by contrast, with her party's convention coming to New Jersey's backyard in two weeks, Mrs. Whitman's horizons are generally seen as limited to a cabinet office at best, or even to an ambassadorship, if Mr. Bush wins in November. ''By and large most people are acknowledging that the vice presidency isn't ready to be served up to her,'' said Tom Wilson, a former director of the state Republican Party.</p>
        <p>In hindsight, many believe that Mrs. Whitman sacrificed any hope of a spot on a national ticket in 1997, when she vetoed a ban on a procedure called partial-birth abortion by opponents of abortion, and won the undying enmity of her party's conservative wing.</p>
        <p>That fall, for all her popularity, she barely squeezed out a victory against James E. McGreevey, then a little-known mayor from Woodbridge.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mrs. Whitman has drawn scant national attention, much of it unwanted. In 1998, the shooting of three unarmed minority men along the New Jersey Turnpike by two state troopers reignited the dormant issue of racial profiling, setting off a protest movement that kept her administration on the defensive, sticking for a year to age-old denials, eventually abandoned, that the practice even existed. Then, last year, Mrs. Whitman spent a few months as a candidate for the United States Senate before withdrawing, citing unfinished business and the demands of fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Stephen A. Salmore, a Republican campaign consultant often critical of the governor, said her early exit from the Senate race pointed up her steadily softening support, which he attributed to a lack of an ideological or geographical political base.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Whitman's support for abortion rights and gay rights has made her a favorite target for conservatives, he said, her memorable stumbles on race -- from her 1995 remark about ''young black males'' competing to see ''how many children you can sire outside of wedlock,'' to the newly surfaced pat-down photo -- have made her vulnerable to attack from the opposite direction. ''She's found herself caught in a political no man's land, without support from the left or the right,'' Mr. Salmore said.</p>
        <p>This week's publicity left one conservative Republican strategist sounding almost nostalgic for Mrs. Whitman's early promise as a tax cutter and welfare reformer. ''She was such the rising star that had she tilted more to the center than center-left, who knows how far she'd have gone,'' he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''If she'd banned partial-birth abortion, there'd be no stopping her. With more of an ideological bent and more of a common touch, she could've been an American Margaret Thatcher.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, scoffed at such past-tense talk, even though by law she cannot run for governor again when her term expires in 2001. ''She's 53 years old,'' he said. ''Deciding to look back now, as if her political career has somehow drawn to a close, I think is foolhardy. She was the first female governor in the history of New Jersey. Will she be the first something else in her life? Probably.''</p>
