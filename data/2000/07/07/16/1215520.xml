        <p>Democrats looking to regain control of the United States Senate this fall had high hopes in the spring that they could deny a second term to Rick Santorum, a Republican freshman from Pennsylvania. He squeaked into office in 1994 with 49 percent of the vote and the conventional wisdom was that he was too conservative for a state with more Democrats than Republicans and had done little since his election to improve his standing with voters.</p>
        <p>President Clinton flew into Philadelphia on Monday to campaign for the Democratic challenger, Representative Ron Klink, a moderate from suburban Pittsburgh. He raised some money for him, roughly $200,000, and gave Democratic hopes an extra boost when he labeled the Santorum seat ''worth fighting for.''</p>

        <p>Democrats looking to regain control of the United States Senate this fall had high hopes in the spring that they could deny a second term to Rick Santorum, a Republican freshman from Pennsylvania. He squeaked into office in 1994 with 49 percent of the vote and the conventional wisdom was that he was too conservative for a state with more Democrats than Republicans and had done little since his election to improve his standing with voters.</p>
        <p>President Clinton flew into Philadelphia on Monday to campaign for the Democratic challenger, Representative Ron Klink, a moderate from suburban Pittsburgh. He raised some money for him, roughly $200,000, and gave Democratic hopes an extra boost when he labeled the Santorum seat ''worth fighting for.''</p>
        <p>But those hopes slumped on Wednesday with the release of a poll that showed Mr. Santorum with a 2-to-1 lead over Mr. Klink. And they sagged even lower on Thursday with release of a campaign finance report that showed Mr. Santorum with nearly an 8-to-1 lead in campaign funds, $4.3 million to $564,500.</p>
        <p>Putting the best face possible on the new reports, Democratic leaders noted that the finance report did not include the just-raised $200,000, and they pointed out that the poll found almost a third of all voters still undecided -- many because they knew little or nothing about Mr. Klink.</p>
