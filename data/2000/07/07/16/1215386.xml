        <p>ANYONE who has watched network television in the last few years has seen Crocodile Dundee (a k a Paul Hogan) tearing through desert and swamp in the ''world's first sport utility wagon,'' the all-wheel-drive Subaru Outback. But those with an interest in auto history will recall a few other wagons that also offered all-wheel drive and could have made a case for an S.U.W. label: the 1988-91 Dodge Colt Vista, the 1992-94 Mitsubishi Expo LRV, the 1988 Nissan Stanza and the 1990 Nissan Axxess.</p>
        <p>None of those are around today, perhaps because they failed to capitalize on the rising trend, perhaps because they were not very good. Automotive history is dotted with successes and failures, of cars that caught fads on the rise and others that arrived as trends turned south.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that Subaru had the timing right with its Outback, which began as a trim package for the 1995 Legacy station wagon. Since then, the Outback gained higher ground clearance and a raised roofline to set it apart from the Legacy, and it spawned a whole range of models, including an Outback sedan and a fancy Outback Limited. Last year, Outbacks -- which are nearly identical, mechanically, to other, less expensive models -- accounted for 39 percent of all Subaru sales and 69 percent of Legacy production. Subaru's full line of wagons has been first in wagon sales in the United States for three years.</p>
        <p>The Legacy/Outback wagons, which are assembled in Indiana, were little changed from 1996 to 1999. But for 2000, Subaru performed major surgery on the Legacy and the Outback, which is now a separate, distinct series.</p>
        <p>The new body is smoother, rounder and about 3 inches longer, with a slightly longer wheelbase. But those familiar with the previous model will have no trouble recognizing the Outback wagon, since most of its visual cues have been kept, including the slightly raised roof and large fog lamps.</p>
        <p>The engine remains a flat four cylinder -- called a ''boxer,'' for the way its pistons flail outward, rather than move up and down -- but it has been redesigned for more low-end torque and better fuel economy. Cars with automatic transmissions have a slightly different all-wheel-drive system from those with stick shifts, but drivers will not notice any difference in their smooth function.</p>
        <p>The front suspension is largely unchanged, but the rear suspension is a new multilink design that intrudes less into the cargo area. The change results not only in a smoother ride and better handling, but also in a cargo floor that is 5.2 inches wider and significantly more useful. There are disk brakes on all four wheels and an antilock system.</p>
        <p>Safety improvements include three-point belts for all five occupants and child-safety-seat anchors for all three rear-seat positions. The Outback (except for the Limited, which comes with leather upholstery) offers as a $200 option a folding, integrated child seat in the center rear position.</p>
        <p>The front safety belts incorporate pretensioners to better position the occupant during a crash and force limiters that work in conjunction with the front air bags to help protect one's chest. The Outback Limited has front seat side-impact air bags in the upper portion of the front seatbacks. The body structure has been designed to dissipate energy better in front, side and rear crashes.</p>
        <p>This new design seems to have paid off. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the Legacy wagon a good rating and calls it a ''best pick'' for its performance in an offset-front crash test at 40 miles an hour -- a severe test of the body structure. Few automobiles in this class have received such a high rating.</p>
        <p>In front-impact tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Legacy sedan received four stars for the driver and passenger. In side-crash tests, the Legacy got four stars for driver safety and five, the top rating, for rear passengers. The tested car did not have side air bags, which might have improved the driver rating.</p>
        <p>In these days of extreme popularity for truck-based sport utilities, it is worth noting that the Outback is certified as a passenger car. Other manufacturers are classifying car-based S.U.V.'s as trucks to take advantage of less stringent regulations governing the safety and emissions of light trucks. This means that the Outback has complied with the full set of Federal safety and emissions regulations, in contrast to vehicles like the Lexus RX 300, the Honda CR-V and the BMW X5, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Compared with previous Outbacks I have driven, and a 1996 model that my wife owns, the 2000 model is a step up in ride quality, noise reduction, and steering and handling. The wagon feels more European in its control over challenging roads and in its precise, nicely weighted steering. Braking is smooth and sure, although there is a bit more free play in the pedal than I would like. The annoying throbbing sound of the 2.5-liter engine has been all but eliminated, and wind noise is fairly low.</p>
        <p>Powerful engine response has never been a Subaru virtue. It still is not, but the new engine has more low-  and medium-range torque so that at less than full throttle it feels fairly strong. One unfortunate result: the wagon moves out almost too abruptly on takeoff from a stop.</p>
        <p>In October, there will be two additional 2001-model Outbacks: the H6-VDC and the H6-3.0 L. L. Bean Edition. These cars will have an all-new 3-liter six-cylinder engine -- the only six that Subaru has offered in this country since the sporty SVX coupe was discontinued in 1996. The L. L. Bean model will wear the logo of the mail-order company inside and out.</p>
        <p>As one who has driven many thousands of  miles in Subarus, I am always impressed by the completely seamless action of their all-wheel drive. Many manufacturers claim that their S.U.V.'s have all-wheel drive that reacts instantly when a wheel loses grip, but in reality many delay, stutter and bump as they compensate for a loss of traction.</p>
        <p>Drivers who venture into challenging four-wheel-drive territory will find that the Outback is hindered by its lack of special low-range gearing and its relatively soft suspension. Yet Subaru says the Outback is capable of recreational off-roading, and with its large tires and generous 7.3 inches of ground clearance, that claim seems fair. But the main advantages of a seamless all-wheel-drive system are smooth response on dry pavement and increased security in heavy rain or moderate snow.</p>
        <p>Inside the Outback, consumers looking for a user-friendly instrument panel and control layout will like what they see. Owners of previous Legacys who have cursed the awkward cup holder will feel much better about the new one. The window and lock switches are simple and easy to use, as are the wiper and light stalks. The Limited has heated front seats and two power moonroofs, one over the front seat and one forward of the rear seat. Their operation is rather strange in that the front moonroof doesn't slide; it only tilts. And although the rear one slides open, it can't be operated unless the front one is tilted. One wonders what the advantage of this curious arrangement may be.</p>
        <p>Buyers looking for the safety and security of all-wheel drive, and who would not be happy with a cruder truck-based sport utility,  have a number of very good station wagons to choose from. Subaru has the lowest-priced wagons in this category, including Legacys that start around $19,000 and the $20,000 Outback Sport -- which is based on the smaller Impreza, not on the Legacy. But in size and comfort, the Sport cannot match wagons in the $25,000 to $30,000 range.</p>
        <p>There, the regular Legacy-based Outback, the Volkswagen Passat 4Motion and the Audi A4 Avant Quattro are attractive, strong-performing wagons. The Audi A6 Avant and the Volvo Cross Country are competitive in the $40,000 range. Another $10,000 puts you into Mercedes territory.</p>
