        <p>LONG ISLAND has become a battleground for the major phone companies, which have launched aggressive advertising campaigns to woo customers to their local, regional and long-distance services.</p>
        <p>''There has always been competition, but the real mass marketing didn't start until we got into long distance,'' said Toby S. Frank, director of consumer competitive response for Bell Atlantic.</p>
        <p>In December, Bell Atlantic became the first of the ''Baby Bells,'' the companies formerly grouped under the AT&amp;T umbrella, to win permission to offer long-distance service, after satisfying the Federal Communications Commission that it had opened the local phone market to competitors.</p>
        <p>A month before the F.C.C. ruling, Sprint opened its bid for these customers, and a month after the ruling AT&amp;T entered the fray. The nation's other major long-distance company, MCI Worldcom, has been offering residential local and regional service since February 1999.</p>
        <p>''It's very intense,'' said a spokesman for AT&amp;T, Gary Morgenstern. ''Bell Atlantic is spending a ton of money on advertising and the competition is fierce. We are doing very well. We have taken more local customers from Bell Atlantic than they have taken long-distance customers from us. And the value of the customers we are taking is greater than those they are taking from us.''</p>
        <p>Dennis Wax, director of regulatory affairs for Bell Atlantic, acknowledged that the competition has had an impact on his company. ''Statewide, we have about 12 million lines, and we have lost 2 million over the past five years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Edward Collins, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, which regulates phone companies, said most of that loss occurred this year. In the first four months, he said, 1,616,845 customers switched from Bell Atlantic to other companies. That compares with 321,280 who switched in 1998 and 946,000 last year.</p>
        <p>Mark Marchand, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, pointed out that during the first three months of this year, his company captured 428,000 long-distance customers and, he said, it is ''well on its way to meeting the one million mark for the year.''</p>
        <p>Jon Hargis, director of marketing for AT&amp;T Consumer Services, said the company was ''exceeding expectations'' in its goal of signing up 750,000 homeowners statewide for its local service by the end of the year. He said that by the end of May, the company had attracted 475,000 customers and that most were downstate. (He did not have separate figures for the Island.)</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Sprint, Greg Embry, declined to say how many customers his company had signed up for local service.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of pent-up demand because people have not had a choice before,'' he added. ''Now when people are presented with two or three choices, it is natural for them to say they will exercise their choice and try something new.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins said the Public Service Commission believes ''that competition will provide customers with more choices in terms of service and lower rates.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Morgenstern, at AT&amp;T, said true competition did not really begin until just a month or two ago, after Bell Atlantic resolved what it said were computer-related problems that delayed the transfer of customers to competitors.</p>
        <p>''Bell Atlantic admitted to mishandling 270,000 orders in New York during the first few months of the year,'' Mr. Morgenstern said.</p>
        <p>In March, Bell Atlantic entered into an agreement with the F.C.C. in which it agreed to pay the Treasury $3 million for its ''loss or mishandling of orders,'' and to pay up to $24 million more if the problem persisted. In addition, the Public Service Commission ordered it to credit $10 million to its competitors in the local phone market, and threatened to require Bell Atlantic to pay another $24 million in credits if the company continued to run into difficulties.</p>
        <p>The commission has also been monitoring consumer complaints stemming from the local phone competition, and fined MCI WorldCom $3 million in April because of the ''higher than normal number of complaints'' it had received regarding the company's local service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, of Bell Atlantic, said that what is occurring now is ''full-blown competition.''</p>
        <p>''And from our perspective, that's not a bad thing,'' he continued. ''It means there are more choices out there, and Bell Atlantic wants to make sure the consumer understands his choices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenstern pointed out, however, that although the major long-distance companies are vying to provide local phone service here, there can be no price war because none of them own their own facilities. They all lease Bell Atlantic's lines and features at wholesale prices and resell the services.</p>
        <p>''Our offer does provide a savings but it is not dramatic,'' he acknowledged. ''It's not like we can say it used to cost 40 cents and now it's a nickel. You can say that for long distance. But we have no control over the cost structure when we have to lease the facilities.''</p>
        <p>As a result, what the competitors are selling is easy-to-understand pricing, package deals and in some cases discounts for customers who sign up for a package of local, regional and long distance service.</p>
        <p>The only company not reselling Bell Atlantic's service is Cablevision Optimum Telephone, which was set up in 1998 and provides local telephone service over cable lines to 10,175 customers in 24 communities in Nassau. A company spokesman, Charles Schueler, said customers who have both Cablevision's telephone and cable-TV service receive a discount on their television bill, depending on the extent of their telephone use. A customer whose Optimum telephone bill was between $50 and $149 would receive a 15 percent reduction in his TV bill, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schueler said also Optimum Telephone's service was 15 to 20 percent cheaper than Bell Atlantic's.</p>
        <p>The company's senior vice president of product management and sales, Patricia Falese, said there are plans to expand telephone service to the rest of Long Island. Asked when, she replied: ''We are trying to find the right marketing and sales mix to optimize penetration. Once we get that right, we will expand in the marketplace.''</p>
        <p>Kurt L. Seidman, 44, of Dix Hills, said he is waiting for the day Cablevision offers him a chance to have cable television, Internet access and telephone service ''all on the same line.'' Until then, he said, he has no interest in switching.</p>
        <p>But other Long Islanders are happy to make a switch to save money. Stuart Lepkowsky, 35, of Hauppauge, said his wife, Fay, switched to MCI in May for local service without telling him.</p>
        <p>''When I saw the bill, I yelled at her, 'What are you switching phone companies for?' and she just pointed to the bill and said, 'Look, those calls were free,' '' Mr. Lepkowsky said.</p>
        <p>When he examined the bill, he said he found that about $15 in regional calls he had made to relatives in Nassau were not charged.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for MCI, Charles Sutlive, explained that the company is providing a $14.99 rebate for two months as an incentive to attract new customers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lepkowsky said it ''still cost me because I had to take my wife out to dinner to make up for yelling at her.''</p>
        <p>The Public Service Commission suggests that before switching phone companies, consumers identify the type of service they have now, decide what different services they may want, compare services and offers, and ask the new companies to send their proposals in writing.</p>
        <p>Sylvia Lee-Foo, 61, of Islip, said she was interested in a what a telemarketer from AT&amp;T had to offer until she asked him to send a copy in writing.</p>
        <p>''He just ignored my request and asked another question,'' she said. ''I would have definitely looked into it. It sounded like they were offering me something beautiful, but as soon as he wouldn't back it up in writing, I figured it was not valid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenstern said he did not know when the AT&amp;T would have such printed material available.</p>
        <p>Mr. Embry, of Sprint, said his company does have printed material on what it calls Sprint Solutions. For $35 a month, residential customers get 100 local calls and 100 minutes of regional and long-distance calls. (Extra calls in each category cost seven cents.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargis said AT&amp;T is pushing a $24.90-a-month plan that offers 75 hours of local calls, five -cents a minute for regional calls and seven cents for long-distance calls.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic has mounted an advertising campaign aimed at keeping its customers from switching by presenting testimonials from those who did, but them came back to Bell Atlantic.</p>
        <p>In two 30-second television commercials narrated by the actor James Earl Jones, unidentified people tell viewers that they were promised savings but found instead that their bills ''almost doubled'' and that ''the savings weren't there.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry I left,'' says one of the unidentified people.</p>
        <p>''I've learned my lesson,'' says another.</p>
