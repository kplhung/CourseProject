        <p>Charley Pride  Country Singer</p>
        <p>The reason there aren't more country singers is probably that in our culture nobody has been individual enough to pursue it, and there was a systematic way of being kept out. Just like being the first senator or the first congressman. But from early childhood, I have been what I am, which is a country singer who happens to have a permanent tan.</p>
        <p>I was taught to work hard, to be fair, to protect myself, the whole nine yards. I listened to country music, and I sang it in spite of being laughed at. My own sister laughed at me and said, ''What are you doing singing their music?'' This permeates the whole country, this ''us, y'all and them.'' I didn't want to capitulate to it. I feel people in this country experience racism every day. There's ''y'all'' and there's ''us.''</p>
        <p>A lot of people will come up and say, ''How does it feel to be the first colored, Negro, Afro-American, African-American country singer?'' I say, ''It feels the same way it did when I was the first colored country singer.'' I started at an early age.</p>
        <p>I've been called the ''N'' word. I remember the first time, and it sticks in my mind. We were putting down butane tanks, out in the country. And the fellow I was working for -- I should have been in school, I was about 15 -- sent me to get a wrench. Well, I didn't know what a Stillson wrench was. I went over to the flatbed and brought the wrong one back. He said, ''Nigger, don't you know what a Stillson is?''</p>
        <p>I thought about what to do. He was down on the ground, and my first instinct was to stomp him on the face. But my mother's upbringing told me, Don't do that. I said: ''My name's not Nigger. My name is Charley.'' He was disarmed and treated me differently after that.</p>
        <p>I don't mind being a role model, but if the news media and other people tell me to go out and save your people, that's just more ''them and us.'' You want as many fans as you can get, but to go out and specifically try to win someone over, I don't think anybody should do that. Ninety-nine percent of my fans are white. All I did was sing the music I love. My sister who laughed at me for singing ''their'' music is glad now. I just bought her a new van.</p>
