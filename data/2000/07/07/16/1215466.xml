        <p>New Yorkers love a party they can't get invited to. Or so you would guess watching the long line outside Ohm, a discotheque on West 22nd Street in Manhattan. There, 600 fashionable men and women, whittled from a list of 1,400 who wanted to attend, sipped flavored martinis and angled for face time before a roving news camera.</p>
        <p>Despite the technology stock meltdown in April, new-economy soirees still attract a lot of media. There were so many reporters there it was nearly impossible to miss them, or the legions of entrepreneurs trying to woo them.</p>
        <p>''This is a bad time for a lot of people,'' said Michael Petersohn, the vice president for sales at Clickfinger.com, a yet-to-be launched Web site that helps users bookmark their favorite sites. ''But things are getting better.'' Clickfinger started developing its site three months before the technology plunge and has had trouble attracting money. But in recent days, potential investors have been more willing to listen to Clickfinger's pitch,  though the commitments are slow in coming. ''Individuals are saying, 'we didn't lose our Hamptons house,' so they are more open,'' he said. ''But it's still hard.''</p>
        <p>And not just for Web builders. Near the front bar, Etyan A. Bar-Chama, 30, a partner at Carpediem Technology Ventures, said investors have balked on the millions of dollars they first promised, leaving the five-month-old fund with only $5 million. ''They are taking down their investments,'' he said. ''We see more competition.''</p>
        <p>Investors, he said, are becoming more selective about what venture capitalists they want to give money to. One way his firm is addressing that is by bringing in other, more established venture capitalists to lead a deal. The fledgling fund has been trying to forge strategic alliances with established corporations that have a history of acquiring venture-backed concerns.</p>
        <p>It was clear, as the First Tuesday festivities drew to a close, that the Internet party that attracted khaki-clad Jeff Bezos clones and sleek  women in Manolo Blahnik heels was, in a larger sense, past its prime.</p>
        <p>Seth J. Price, vice president of business development for the Web site USLaw.com, said he used to go to ''three or four parties a night and walk away with martini glasses and stuff like that.'' But those days are gone. ''Now you have the concept of profitability and people are looking at the cost,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That did not dampen the spirits of Walter Joyce, vice president for strategic planning at Inculab, a Manhattan-based incubator for Internet ideas. ''I came to try and gauge the pulse,'' he said. ''I'm still optimistic.''</p>
