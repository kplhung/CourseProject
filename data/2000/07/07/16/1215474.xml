        <p>Remember when you were a kid and you would sit on your grandfather's lap and he would say something like: ''When I was your age, I had to walk 15 miles to school. And I didn't even have any shoes!''</p>
        <p>I can't say I had it quite that rough as a youngster, but as someone who has been a part of the evolution of women's basketball, trust me: the game has come a long, long way, and the Women's National Basketball Association is here to stay.</p>

        <p>Remember when you were a kid and you would sit on your grandfather's lap and he would say something like: ''When I was your age, I had to walk 15 miles to school. And I didn't even have any shoes!''</p>
        <p>I can't say I had it quite that rough as a youngster, but as someone who has been a part of the evolution of women's basketball, trust me: the game has come a long, long way, and the Women's National Basketball Association is here to stay.</p>
        <p>When I played at U.C.L.A., starting in 1975, we were lucky if we got a few hundred people at our games -- and they were mostly family members and friends.</p>
        <p>Now, the Houston Comets regularly draw crowds of more than 12,000, and crowds at the Liberty games are around 14,000; the United States women's soccer team drew 90,185 to the Rose Bowl last July for the World Cup final against China.</p>
        <p>Through the emergence of female athletes in the Olympics and the promotion of female athletes in general, women now travel around the world playing sports. The Amateur Athletic Union and USA Basketball now provide opportunities for girls at a much younger age to compete in basketball. Before they even enter high school, they have been able to compete around the country and maybe even overseas. The players are on international teams together; it is a wonderful opportunity.</p>
        <p>Television exposure makes a big difference in women's basketball. Not only is the W.N.B.A. marketed, but sports information departments at universities are also marketing the women's college teams as well. Also, look at Nike and Kodak and how they have supported women's sports over the past 20 to 25 years.</p>
        <p>In the 70's, by contrast, I was a four-time all-American and player of the year, and there were coaches on the East Coast who did not know who I was. You never got to see those players play -- where would you see them? There was no TV or video. Now players travel, and now fans, coaches, can see people play.</p>
        <p>The N.B.A.'s support of the W.N.B.A. has been crucial. Five years ago, who knew who Cynthia Cooper was? Teresa Weatherspoon? American players were forced to go overseas to play, but now they have the W.N.B.A. Now I'll see N.B.A. players playing with Sheryl Swoopes and saying how good she is, how good Crystal Robinson and Lisa Leslie are. Because the news media have given so much exposure to the N.B.A., to hear the opinions of N.B.A. players only gives the W.N.B.A. that much more credibility.</p>
        <p>When I was playing, there were talented players, too -- Carol Blazejowski, Cheryl Miller and Nancy Lieberman-Cline, to name three -- and we played against N.B.A. players all the time. I used to go to at Pauley Pavilion and play against them. The N.B.A. supported female players in the 70's and 80's, but there was no league where the women could shine, no reporters around. Someone like Jerry West would say, ''Ann Meyers can do this,'' but it did not hold any water because there was not enough public interest, so no one wanted to report on it.</p>
        <p>The backing of the N.B.A. will help keep the W.N.B.A. strong. Those resources are something that past women's leagues -- including the American Basketball League (1996-98) and the Women's Basketball League (1978-81), in which I played for the New Jersey Gems -- did not have. In 1978, the W.B.L. became the first women's basketball league in the United States to be successful, but it lasted only three years. After that, several leagues tried to establish themselves but folded. The W.N.B.A. appears determined not to repeat those failures.</p>
        <p>Today is so different in so many ways, and advertising reflects that. Now, you can hardly turn on the television without seeing Teresa Weatherspoon's half-court shot at the end of last September's Liberty-Comets playoff game. It was such a big shot for women's basketball.</p>
        <p>Then there are the ads with Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan. At the women's Sports Foundation Summit in May, Doug Flutie spoke and he said that his daughter asked him, ''Daddy, who's that guy in the commercial with Mia Hamm?''</p>
        <p>The ads lend credibility to women's sports, but I think it will be even greater when we can stand on our own. And I think we can.</p>
        <p>The W.N.B.A. was smart enough to send Lisa Leslie, who played at the University of Southern California, to Los Angeles, and Rebecca Lobo, a star for the University of Connecticut, to New York, close to their fan base. When I played in the W.B.L. in the late 1970's, they sent me to New Jersey. Hardly anyone knew me in the East and it was a difficult situation. By contrast, the W.N.B.A. not only sold the players in their markets, but this familiarity also helped sell the teams and the league.</p>
        <p>Of course, this is only the W.N.B.A.'s fourth year. I think that to truly say that the league is a sound, stable league, you have to wait until at least the 10th year. Val Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president, has done a remarkable job guiding the league through its many changes -- through the start-up, then expansion, last year's debut of the All-Star Game and this year's accommodations for the Olympics. The league is changing from year to year, and she has done a good job of dealing with challenges.</p>
        <p>My primary hope is that the women continue to play for the passion of the game in addition to the financial rewards. I don't want players to lose sight of the importance of an education, because they will need it: a lot of women who played in the W.N.B.A. in the first year are not in the league anymore. Even with expansion, as the level of talent continues to rise, the marginal players will find themselves getting squeezed out.</p>
        <p>Now I am recognized more as an announcer than as a former player -- probably many of the girls who see me broadcast games don't realize I used to play. My husband, Don Drysdale, who died in 1993, was a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers. He won 209 games in 14 years in the majors, but he was a baseball announcer for longer than he played. He always told me that you're only as good as yesterday's paper.</p>
        <p>I'm very proud of what I accomplished as a player. I'm just as proud to say I played for the love of the game -- not to be in the Hall of Fame. I want everybody to live their dream. When we started, in 1976, we didn't have all the junior programs. Things have changed so much, and it is so wonderful for our game. It gives dreams a chance.</p>
