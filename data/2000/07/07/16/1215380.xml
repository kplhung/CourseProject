        <p>If Bob Mesnard could make a wish and blow out the candles, he would do just that.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Mesnard, a resident of Third Street, says that for a year he has been plagued by fumes, noise and dust from the Classic Candle Corporation, a scented candle factory, whose owners broke open a formerly sealed window and fitted it with an industrial-size fan that faces his backyard.</p>
        <p>''It sort of sounds like La Guardia Airport,'' Mr. Mesnard said. He described the noise as a roar with a repetitive squeaking sound. ''One of the neighbors thought they were being invaded by crickets.''</p>
        <p>Irving Sealy, another neighbor, described a ''sweet, sickly scent'' settling over the neighborhood. He said that although the factory has been there for four years, only when the window was opened did he notice a problem. ''The smell is horrendous,'' he said. ''My wife has allergies and she's been affected.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesnard and Mr. Sealy described a waxy dust that settled over their yards, killing plants and fish. But Mr. Mesnard said efforts to talk with the factory owners were unsuccessful. ''They said they were there to make a profit and they were not going to do anything unless they were forced to,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A man at the factory who said he was the owner and gave his name only as Michael said the fan was not blowing air out, but bringing it in for ventilation for his employees. He added that it was impossible for fumes and dust to be going out.</p>
        <p>''If I turn the fan the other way, forget it,'' he said. ''They're not going to be able to breathe.''</p>
        <p>As for headaches, he said: ''All our candles are 100 percent natural fragrance and cannot make a headache. People buy these candles to get relaxed.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Buildings issued a violation to the factory last month because of broken glass that fell outside when the window was forced open. The Department of Environmental Protection also conducted several recent inspections at the site and found no violations because of fumes, but did issue a violation because of the fan's noise, said Jeff Ryan, a spokesman. He added that  the department would inspect the premises again soon.</p>
        <p>That is little solace for Mr. Mesnard, who still mourns the loss of the 16 ornamental Koi carp in his backyard pond that, he said, all died within a week of the window opening.</p>
        <p>''It was sad,'' he said, ''because some of them I'd had for eight years,  and they were very fine specimens.''</p>
