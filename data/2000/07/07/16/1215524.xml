        <p>It was to be the triumph of justice over vengeance.

        <p>It was to be the triumph of justice over vengeance. The Nuremberg trials, which began in NOVEMBER(??) 1945, at the end of World War II, would establish the principle that government leaders were accountable for crimes against humanity and that no individual was exempt from guilt for committing atrocities in wartime simply by claiming he was following orders.</p>
        <p>Four justices, from the United States, England, France and Russia, presided over the trial of 21 senior Nazi officials. Among those facing the court were the wily, fat Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering; Julius Streicher, publisher of the anti-Semitic newspaper Der Sturmer, whose vile antics had brought him the disfavor even of Hitler; the contrite Albert Speer, Hitler's favorite architect; and the Nazi foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, known as the Mad Hatter, who babbled insanely.</p>
        <p>In setting up the tribunal, the Allies had no body of law upon which to rely. They had to invent a new system of legal procedures -- one that would form the basis for future trials of those who commit crimes against humanity in the name of war.</p>
        <p>Tonight and tomorrow night, TNT presents ''Nuremberg,'' the story of that groundbreaking trial and of the powerful personalities who took part in it. The film, written by David W. Rintels and directed by Yves Simoneau, is based on the book ''Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial,'' by Joseph E. Persico. Unlike the 1961 film ''Judgment at Nuremberg,'' the TNT drama uses testimony and other material from the court transcripts. The producers also went to great lengths to reproduce the actual courtroom in which the trials were held. The cast includes Brian Cox as Goering; Christopher Plummer as the British prosecutor, Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe; Max von Sydow as Sam Rosenman, who recruited Robert Jackson on behalf of Truman to prosecute the trial; and Jill Hennessy as Jackson's secretary and love interest.</p>
        <p>The drama centers on Jackson, played by Alec Baldwin, who took the part, he said, in order to introduce the Nuremberg trials to a new generation of young people largely unfamiliar with them. ''Most kids today born after 1980, their awareness is all about popular culture,'' said Mr. Baldwin, also one of the show's executive producers. ''They don't know the things that you and I grew up with.''</p>
        <p>The real Jackson was a small-town lawyer from Jamestown, N.Y., who had begun practicing law when it was still possible to do so by apprenticing to another lawyer instead of getting a law degree. A political liberal and a champion of the Constitution, he was appointed solicitor general in 1938 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and chief justice in 1941.</p>
        <p>''As a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, he had a nice, cushy job,'' said Mr. Baldwin, who discussed the historical background of the trials in a recent interview in New York. Jackson, he said, agreed to go to Nuremberg ''when he was told it was a chance to make history -- 'You're going to be the David Merrick of the trial and produce the whole thing from straw.' ''</p>
        <p>Jackson was a great legal orator, and the role gave Mr. Baldwin (who is 42, some 10 years younger than Jackson was at the trial) a chance to utter some of the grandest lines ever delivered in a courtroom. In his opening speech, Mr. Baldwin, as Jackson, sets the premise for the proceedings: ''That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason.''</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, though, there was squabbling between Jackson and the American judge, Francis Biddle, who wanted to be president of the court. In the film, the two men clash disceetly but repeatedly, until Jackson accuses Biddle of sabotaging his prosecution of Goering.</p>
        <p>But Jackson's chief antagonist in ''Nuremberg'' is Goering himself. In one scene, Goering, who weighed 264 pounds when he surrendered, debates the question of Nazi medical experiments with the prisoners' psychologist, Captain Gustav Gilbert, played by Matt Craven.</p>
        <p>''Let me ask you this: What was Hiroshima?'' Mr. Cox's Goering asks. ''Was it not your medical experiment? And would America have dropped atom bombs on Germany as easily as it did on Japan, making sure to kill as many civilians as possible? I say not. Because to an American, a Japanese child seems less human than a Caucasian child.''</p>
        <p>Goering was a cunning adversary in the courtroom as well. ''He was speaking over the head of the tribunal to the German people'' about the glories of National Socialism, Mr. Baldwin said. He attempted to stonewall the prosecutor's cross-examination of him, and Jackson, who had not tried a case in years, was accused of being unprepared.</p>
        <p>The film follows the trajectory of Jackson's dawning awareness of the true magnitude of the trial. ''At the beginning, Jackson thought, 'Let's nail them on this paper trail of broken treaties,' '' Mr. Baldwin said.</p>
        <p>At first Jackson, he added, thought that ''putting people on trial for war crimes was like handing out speeding tickets.''</p>
        <p>Then films of prisoners at death camps were screened for the court. At that point in history, few had seen the photographic evidence of the crimes. ''Nuremberg'' uses some of the same footage that was shown during the actual proceedings. As the film flickers on the screen, there is no sound except the projector's whirr, and the camera moves in on Mr. Baldwin's face as Jackson himself realizes the full horror of the crimes.</p>
        <p>By the trial's end, ''Jackson's grasp of the significance of the war crimes has overtaken Goering's rhetoric,'' said Mr. Baldwin. ''Their crimes were not committed by some rogue operation. This was administered by a government.'' Jackson went on to deliver a Shakespearean summation: ''They stand before the record of this trial as bloodstained Gloucester stood by the body of his slain king. He begged the widow, as they beg of you, 'Say I slew them not.' And the queen replied: 'Then say they are not slain. But dead they are.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1946 Jackson resigned as prosecutor to return to the Supreme Court, and his place was taken by Telford Taylor, who conducted the ensuing trials. During his 11 months at Nuremberg, he had helped forge a new principle of international law: ''No longer may the head of a state consider himself outside the law and impose inhuman acts on the peoples of the world,'' the real Jackson said after the trials. ''It was a legacy infinitely more important than my work on the Supreme Court.''</p>
