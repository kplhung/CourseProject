        <p>THE SETTING -- Crane &amp; Company Paper Makers in Rockefeller Center, where among the wooden racks of stationery and rows of inkpens on Wednesday afternoon sat Ms. Demeanor, otherwise known as Mary M. Mitchell, a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer and author of several mannerly manuals, including her latest, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Etiquette.''</p>
        <p>She was hoping to convert people into readers and dispense the advice that has made her a name in the etiquette game. She and her hero, Letitia Baldrige, are writing a book together. The table of contents alone is 37 pages.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- So is it good etiquette to call someone an idiot?</p>
        <p>''You know, I caught a lot of heat from my friends about that,'' Ms. Mitchell said, chuckling. ''But I just told them it's we who call ourselves idiots.''</p>
        <p>She was referring to the embarrassed disclaimers the suited professionals and sunburned tourists used at her book-signing table. Questions often began: ''I should know this, but'' or ''I feel so silly asking this, but'' or ''I can never remember what to do when.'' Ms. Mitchell reassured them.</p>
        <p>Manners are a mixture of common sense and kindness, she said, but etiquette is simply a list of rules to be learned. At least 20 questions here  were about thank-you notes, their necessity, timing and wording. She believes in the handwritten note.</p>
        <p>But times are changing, and so long as one has good manners, she says, one can forgo etiquette now and then. But some still want a definite ruling.</p>
        <p>A couple approached. ''We're getting married,'' said Ken Whitacre of Florida, his fiancee, Kerri Jenkins, at his side. ''So, who is supposed to pay for the wedding band?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell, standing because she said she felt awkward sitting, said: ''Well, traditionally, you would buy each other's. You buy hers and she buys yours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre asked, ''But what if I want to pay for both?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell paused, then looked over at Ms. Jenkins. ''Why would you ever say no?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jenkins: ''I don't think he is supposed to do that. It's not his job.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell: ''Sometimes it's hard to say thank you to big gifts, and you don't want to start the marriage one-sided.''</p>
        <p>They nodded eagerly. She is good.</p>
        <p>She turned to Mr. Whitacre. ''Just buy her another ring next year,'' she said. ''Let her get this one.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jenkins was so relieved she gave a little hop. ''Oh, we like her! We like her!''</p>
        <p>Gooey grins all around, and the happy pair was out the door. Ms. Mitchell may sit down now.</p>
