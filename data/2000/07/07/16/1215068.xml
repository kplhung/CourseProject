        <p>THE best restaurants in Budapest are Italian and French.'' Thus spake Laszlo Alkonyi, the editor of Borbarat, Hungary's leading wine review. Indeed, Fausto, his favorite, and Lou-Lou, Italian and French respectively, are very good restaurants in which you'll meet ''le tout Budapest.'' But they weren't my favorites. A week of dedicated dining in Budapest's Hungarian restaurants was as delectable as it was illuminating. I didn't find the Magyar Alain Ducasse, but I did eat really good local food and felt very much part of the life of the city.</p>
        <p>Hungarian food is heavy. But though my friend Joyce and I were there during a heat wave, we never found it unappetizing -- even goulash, which is not a stew but a meat soup, originally cooked by cowboys in cauldrons over an open fire. It's seasoned, of course, with paprika. And paprika, both hot and sweet, is the universal spice, often replacing shakers of black pepper on dining room tables.</p>

        <p>THE best restaurants in Budapest are Italian and French.'' Thus spake Laszlo Alkonyi, the editor of Borbarat, Hungary's leading wine review. Indeed, Fausto, his favorite, and Lou-Lou, Italian and French respectively, are very good restaurants in which you'll meet ''le tout Budapest.'' But they weren't my favorites. A week of dedicated dining in Budapest's Hungarian restaurants was as delectable as it was illuminating. I didn't find the Magyar Alain Ducasse, but I did eat really good local food and felt very much part of the life of the city.</p>
        <p>Hungarian food is heavy. But though my friend Joyce and I were there during a heat wave, we never found it unappetizing -- even goulash, which is not a stew but a meat soup, originally cooked by cowboys in cauldrons over an open fire. It's seasoned, of course, with paprika. And paprika, both hot and sweet, is the universal spice, often replacing shakers of black pepper on dining room tables.</p>
        <p>Hungarian menus are epic in length, and portions are usually huge. Goulash is inevitable, as is veal or chicken paprikas, freshwater fish like fogas (pike perch) and catfish, stuffed turkey, goose and goose foie gras (Hungary is one of the world's leading producers of foie gras), noodles with bacon, sour cream and turo (cottage cheese), and palacsinta, translated as pancake or crepe, either sweet or savory.</p>
        <p>Most restaurants have English menus and claim that English is spoken. Brush up on your sign language. You usually do get what you think you've ordered but not always. And the mistranslations can be hilarious. ''Smooth hound,'' for example, was one restaurateur's stab at wild pigeon. Go know.</p>
        <p>Hungarian wines are another delicious discovery. A revolution is under way as vintners reinvent their craft after 40 years of working under a state system that favored quantity over quality. Sweet, luscious Tokaj aszu, the unctuous white dessert wines, are the jewels in Hungary's crown, but there are also fragrant whites and  supple reds, particularly from the Villanyi region.</p>
        <p>Nancsi Neni</p>
        <p>The name means Aunt Nancy and this restaurant, in the suburbs north of Buda, has an appropriately familial feel. A white cottage with extensions added over the years; a large garden with chestnut trees; shelves of home-preserved peppers and pickles; kindly waiters with pot bellies; and enticing smells from the kitchen. It's an inviting, appetite-whetting ensemble and, after a memorable meal, I'd happily work my way through the restaurant's entire repertory.</p>
        <p>No easy task, this. Nancsi Neni has a typically encylopedic menu. But not everything is on hand at all times -- as I realized after ordering a series of appetizers, all of which were unavailable until I hit upon fish soup, a rustic, tasty broth rich with the flavor of paprika. In it was a superfresh steak of catfish that had been perfectly poached in the broth and would have made a satisfying meal by itself. Deep-fried zucchini, however, was so delicious we'd have liked a bigger portion. Its curious accompaniments included good white rice, sweetened sour cream (ubiquitous in Hungary) and a delectable garlic-potato puree.</p>
        <p>Sullo, young pike perch from Lake Balaton, gets royal treatment here. Somehow it is fileted but remains whole. Then it is breaded and deep fried. The fish is incredibly delicate and the breading, though a tad salty, is crunchy and delectable. We also ordered what had been billed as ''shaggy ribs'' but what we got was Wiener schnitzel. No complaints, however, as it was tender, juicy and encased in an excellent garlic-accented breading. The garnishes, though pleasant, were the same as those served with the zucchini.</p>
        <p>Pancakes filled with turo mixed with lemon peel, raisins and vanilla-scented sour cream reminded me of my grandmother's blintzes. They were so delicious that Joyce, who was not going to have dessert, polished off half and said, ''This could be my ideal dessert.'' The ambitious wine list includes the '99 Etyeki Kuria chardonnay ($7.75), a crisp, clean white with an aroma of apricots.</p>
        <p>Muzeum</p>
        <p>Founded in 1885, this venerable restaurant is next door to Hungary's National Museum. Airy and genteel, it's a fine vintage setting with dark wainscotting, tiled walls, sculptured beams and enormous windows with great swags of drapery. The clientele is an agreeable mix of businessmen, denizens of the art world, ladies who lunch and tourists.</p>
        <p>The service is admirably professional and the cooking traditional without being stodgy. Case in point: Muzeum's pancake Hortobagy style, a beggar's purse stuffed with a toothsome mix of ground chicken and peppers on a sauce of roasted red pepper, is a lip-smacking taste of Old World cooking. The presentation of smoked trout was mouthwatering: a large fillet draped across a platter with a mound of sliced cucumbers gleaming in paprika, parsley and honey dressing. Muzeum's veal paprikas, tender chunks of good meat in a creamy paprika sauce, was so classic it could be served at diplomatic dinners. Lake Balaton pike perch Muzeum style presented two slabs of fish, one in a dill-accented sauce, the other breaded and wrapped in bacon. We preferred the latter but, in both cases, the fish was delicate and moist, with fine, silky texture. And the garnish of egg noodles tossed with roasted garlic, dill and bacon was brilliant enough to stand on its own.</p>
        <p>For dessert, the sour cherry strudel was very good indeed: a layer of juicy tart cherries encased in a rich, flaky pastry crust flavored with nuts, lemon peel and lots of cinnamon. And the '97 Egri Leanyka from Vilmos Thummerer ($8.90), an appetizingly floral white, was the ideal choice for a summer lunch.</p>
        <p>Kisbuda Gyonge</p>
        <p>''The Pearl of Little Buda'' is a heartwarming restaurant in Obuda, the oldest part of the city. The decor is eccentric and utterly charming. Doors of numerous armoires have been pieced together to form a sort of wainscotting; the ceilings are painted as if vaguely inspired by Tiepolo; there are old family photos and breakfronts filled with Herend porcelain. In the garden, packed with locals on a warm summer night, a pianist pounds out Mozart as emphatically as the accompanist in a ballet class. The service is unassuming and friendly;  the food, as unaffected and endearing as the setting, starting with honest-to-god goulash (as tasty as the home-cooked versions I'd eaten in wine regions) and very good oxtail soup.</p>
        <p>Textbook chicken paprikas came with a stellar version of sztrapacska,  a Slovakian specialty combining potatoes, cottage cheese and ewe's milk. And what was billed as a ''Hungarian goose feast'' was precisely that: a plate overflowing with goose drumstick and thigh (wonderfully crackly skin and succulent meat), a slab of foie gras (overcooked), a mound of delectable braised red cabbage and a deliciously homey heap of potatoes cooked with onion and paprika.</p>
        <p>Somloi galuska, a popular Hungarian confection consisting of very moist sponge cake interspersed with pastry cream, raisins and nuts, the whole bathed in rum and chocolate sauce, is about as rich a dessert as I can imagine. Surprisingly, it was light and fluffy. More restrained but equally satisfying was a cake filled with warm sour cherries, ground walnuts and turo. A '97 Kadarka Szekszardi ($14) from Peter Vida, an assertive and tart light red, intrigued me but disappointed my knowledgeable companion, Laszlo Alkonyi, who has greater expectations of the kadarka grape. He had no reservations, however, about the quality of the meal.</p>
        <p>Remiz</p>
        <p>If ''Sex and the City'' ever shoots in Hungary, Remiz, which typifies New Budapest, would be a major location. Remiz means tram depot, and the restaurant, set back in a shady garden north of the city center, resembles a street car made of white brick. Its small dining rooms are crowded, noisy and engagingly decorated with an eclectic mix of posters, fake columns and 30's-style chairs. An elderly pianist ripples through rock ballads accompanied by a trombonist.</p>
        <p>The vast menu has Italian and French overtones. The specialty, however, is meat grilled on lava stone. I've heard complaints of overgrilling but that was not my experience. On the contrary. Our grilled spareribs were the best I recall having eaten, glistening, meaty and succulent. But the enormous portion was enough to feed four and was so delicious that we gave short shrift to the mellow grilled foie gras nicely accompanied by cooked apple slices and parsleyed potatoes. Our appetizers, though not as memorable, were tasty, particularly the lightly smoked eggplant mousse. Whipped into a mayonnaiselike emulsion, it was (meaninglessly, to mind my mind) stuffed into a fresh pepper. A '97 Cuvee Phoenix from Gere &amp; Weninger ($21), a lightly spicy red from Villany, went admirably with just about everything.</p>
        <p>The young, harried waiters get the job done without a lot of niceties -- particularly when it comes to dessert. Advised to visit the display case, I did and chose a somloi galuska, as delicious as the version at Kisbuda Gyonge.</p>
        <p>Cafe Kor</p>
        <p>''We always have lunch at Cafe Kor,'' the well-traveled Danish owner of a Tokaj vineyard told me. He enjoys the breezy, cosmopolitan flavor of this casual restaurant near the basilica. And it seems to be a hang-out for the cell-phone-toting generation, which fills the place at mealtime.  In a good-sized room with large windows, ceiling fans and racks of Hungarian newspapers, Cafe Kor offers daily specials written in Hungarian and English on a pull-down roll of butcher paper. And the young servers speak much better English than their confreres in other restaurants.</p>
        <p>You can order ''small'' portions for 70 percent of the price of the normal dish. As we learned with a roasted goat cheese appetizer, the ''small'' portions would be a normal American serving. The dish itself turned out to be a perfectly fried fritter stuffed with garlic-scented goat cheese. Yummy. It came with a big helping of good salad and fresh tomatoes. Lecso (Hungarian ratatouille) was a straightforward and lustily flavored stew of tomatoes, paprika and red and yellow peppers with eggs scrambled into the blend as well as chunks of meaty sausage.</p>
        <p>Cafe Kor's short wine list is excellent, and everything offered by bottle is also available by the glass. We treated ourselves to the '96 Bock Royal Cuvee Villany ($18), a vigorous blend of cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir, aged in new oak barrels.</p>
        <p>Gundel</p>
        <p>Around the corner from the Fine Arts Museum and across the street from the zoo, Gundel, which opened in 1894, is the city's most famous, most historic and most expensive restaurant. The legendary chef Karoly Gundel took over the place in 1910 and created a number of dishes that have become part of Hungary's restaurant repertory. In 1991 George Lang, the Hungarian-American restaurateur, bought Gundel with the backing of Ronald S. Lauder, spent millions renovating it and reopened it with much fanfare, thus signaling the rebirth of fine dining in Hungary. Though other spots now surpass Gundel in quality, it remains Budapest's ultimate occasion restaurant and the one in which you're most likely to run into someone from home.</p>
        <p>Surely it is the city's most beautiful dining spot. The vast and sumptuous room has immense windows giving onto the park, columns polished to a mirrorlike gleam, beautiful chandeliers, silk banquettes, oils by Hungarian masters, lavish bouquets and tables set with Zsolnay porcelain.</p>
        <p>It is a real pity, then, that my meal at Gundel disappointed. The six-piece orchestra played show tunes off key; the service, at times considerate, was mostly condescending; and the food was decidedly anticlimactic. By chance I ordered almost the same meal as the one I'd enjoyed at Kisbuda Gyonge and Gundel suffered by comparison. The goulash was pleasant but one-dimensional; the goose was dry and overcooked, except for the thigh, which was juicy and delicious, as was the melt-in-the-mouth braised cabbage. Roasted crown of rabbit was so dry as to be inedible and the accompanying ''ratatouille'' seemed a bland afterthought. How ever, ''Uncle Lang's hot smoked goose liver,'' an appetizer, was perhaps the best foie gras I had in Hungary. It came with frizzled onions -- a witty turn on liver and onions -- and a flavorless wedge of potato pie. Crepe  a la Gundel, filled with raisins and walnuts and bathed in a chocolate sauce, may have been the best dish of those I tried.</p>
        <p>Gundel's own wine brand dominates the creditable list from which we ordered the '98 Cuvee Tiffan from Ede Tiffan ($30), a suave red with flavors of plums and black cherries.</p>
        <p>Bagolyvar</p>
        <p>This restaurant is Gundel's bistro spinoff. Decked out like a country auberge, it has an inviting garden with tables under enormous umbrellas. Though the service is inept if well-meaning and the food lackluster, the setting is so pleasant that lunch here is irresistible after a morning at the nearby Fine Arts Museum.</p>
        <p>The emphasis is on home-style cooking. But the limited lunch menu is thoroughly standard, with no suggestion of freshness or hominess. Ditto for the execution. Hungarian meat soup was a flavorless broth with no meat in sight. A mixed salad, a slaw of cucumber, carrots and frisee with a yogurt dressing, was average. Mititei, dense little sausages of lamb, beef and pork, were salty and dry but tasty all the same. Only rib steak stuffed with meat and red peppers hinted at skill and thoughtfulness in the kitchen. Three desserts were available when I visited: ice cream, strawberries and a pleasant cake made with canned peaches. Underwhelming. Gundel wines are the only ones offered. Of these the '97 Egri Bikaver ($13) was a medium-bodied red with the spicy fire of paprika.</p>
