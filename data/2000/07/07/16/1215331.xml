        <p>The issue, for me, is the concept of a ''moving'' stereo. It wasn't the lyrics that bothered you, it was the volume.</p>

        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>The issue, for me, is the concept of a ''moving'' stereo. It wasn't the lyrics that bothered you, it was the volume.</p>
        <p>What I would do, and what I have done in the past, is turn up the volume of the music in my own car -- usually the oldies, or 1010 WINS, perhaps the Gypsy Kings, and that, in turn, gets me a dirty look from the offender.</p>
        <p>The racial issue you allude to is one that happens only in your mind. Perhaps you hesitated because the other man is black, and based on that and his music, you made some judgments. You would not have made those judgments if he had been a snotty rich white kid. But the latter may have been the more dangerous of the two.</p>
