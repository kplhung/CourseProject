        <p>It is Open season and Jennifer Capriati will return to the scene of past triumphs as she works her hardcourt game into shape for the United States Open next month. Capriati will play Monica Seles this Friday in her opening match at the Mahwah Tennis Classic, an exhibition in Mahwah, N.J., that she has won three times since 1991.</p>
        <p>I definitely feel like I can contend with anybody now, Capriati said the other day in a conference call. The key for me is to feel good physically and be injury-free. I've had a good stretch, doing really well in Australia and continuing it.</p>

        <p>It is Open season and Jennifer Capriati will return to the scene of past triumphs as she works her hardcourt game into shape for the United States Open next month. Capriati will play Monica Seles this Friday in her opening match at the Mahwah Tennis Classic, an exhibition in Mahwah, N.J., that she has won three times since 1991.</p>
        <p>I definitely feel like I can contend with anybody now, Capriati said the other day in a conference call. The key for me is to feel good physically and be injury-free. I've had a good stretch, doing really well in Australia and continuing it.</p>
        <p>Capriati reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in January, losing to Lindsay Davenport, and has recorded subsequent victories over Mary Pierce and Martina Hingis (both in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong). Most recently, she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon, losing creditably to Davenport.</p>
        <p>Capriati enters the six-week countdown to the United States Open ranked No. 15 and with an old and new coach, her father, Stefano (He's always been my coach, really), after parting with Harold Solomon in April.</p>
        <p>He did a lot for my confidence and my focus, Capriati said about Solomon, but I felt my game was there. It's always been there, I just needed someone to give me that boost. Now, I can do that for myself.</p>
