        <p>THE CAFE AT ROSEMONT is the sort of place you talk about reluctantly -- a secret you want to keep. It inhabits one of those corners of New Jersey that are vanishing as fast as developers can crack the zoning codes, a place of barns and cornfields and gentle hills, of two-lane roads where you half-expect to see Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn coming over the next rise in a Packard convertible.</p>
        <p>In fact, they might have parked that convertible in the gravel lot behind the Cafe, a sprawling Civil War-era general store that looks more or less as it did in an 1886 photograph hanging in the rear lobby. And while they are a little too formally dressed -- Grant in his tweeds, Hepburn in a flowing summer frock -- they look right at home at their antique wooden table beside a window, the setting sun glinting off the silverware.</p>

        <p>THE CAFE AT ROSEMONT is the sort of place you talk about reluctantly -- a secret you want to keep. It inhabits one of those corners of New Jersey that are vanishing as fast as developers can crack the zoning codes, a place of barns and cornfields and gentle hills, of two-lane roads where you half-expect to see Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn coming over the next rise in a Packard convertible.</p>
        <p>In fact, they might have parked that convertible in the gravel lot behind the Cafe, a sprawling Civil War-era general store that looks more or less as it did in an 1886 photograph hanging in the rear lobby. And while they are a little too formally dressed -- Grant in his tweeds, Hepburn in a flowing summer frock -- they look right at home at their antique wooden table beside a window, the setting sun glinting off the silverware.</p>
        <p>Around them, diners are talking convivially (no shouting required here) and digging into their main courses. On the walls are paintings of local scenes by local artists. Wooden shelves hold a library of well-used cookbooks and even a few items for sale (if you happen to need wax paper or organic toothpaste). An old-fashioned refrigerator case hums away in the center of the room, chilling the desserts.</p>
        <p>This time-warp illusion would swiftly lose its charm if it began to seem cloying or inauthentic. But Lola Wykoff and Peg Peterson, who have owned the Cafe for 11 years, seem to know exactly what they have and how to keep it vital. Their restaurant works not as a movie set but as an experience, an evening's escape from superhighways, cineplexes, fast food and, for that matter, haute cuisine.</p>
        <p>The tall, genial headwaiter, Bill Shepherd, who greets every diner and works many of the tables, is as much an embodiment of the Cafe as its mismatched furniture and comforting, unpretentious food. He is a grown-up. He wears street clothes, knows how to handle the wine you bring, talks knowledgeably about the menu, and in general treats you like a guest in his home.</p>
        <p>As for the menu, it is not four-star cooking. But then, neither are these four-star prices. Ms. Wykoff, Ms. Peterson and their fellow chefs, Angel Fario and Fay Putkovich, have little formal training. What they offer is home cooking with enough inventive touches to let you know they're enjoying themselves.</p>
        <p>The Cafe serves breakfast and lunch six days a week, and dinner five nights. On Wednesday evenings, the cooks spread their wings by offering an ethnic menu, every week from a different culture. Two weeks ago, it was Native American, with Natchez corn fritters, pumpkin soup, Navajo green chili with pork posole, and Iroquois trout; last week it was Provencal, and this coming Wednesday it will be Turkish.</p>
        <p>The regular menu changes often, to take advantage of seasonal ingredients, so the recommendations that follow should be taken as a template for what works at the Cafe: simple, honest, full-flavored food that, like the restaurant itself, feels entirely at home in its setting.</p>
        <p>Green lentils, an appetizer one night, couldn't have been better: a hillock of crunchy lentils in a garlic vinaigrette made with high-quality olive oil, topped by several rounds of creamy goat cheese. A scallop satay -- five small, nicely seared scallops on a skewer -- came on a bed of sesame and seaweed, with a peppery coconut dipping sauce. While tomato bisque was nothing special -- the spiciness couldn't disguise a distinct canned flavor -- a cup of Thai coconut-chicken soup had heat and depth.</p>
        <p>On another night, we tried two different kinds of black-bean appetizer and liked them both: a thick soup with appealing notes of pepper and sherry, and a chili seasoned with cumin, sour cream, tomato and onion. Marinated mozzarella looked and tasted lovely on a bed of greens, with bits of red pepper, garlic and mint from the garden. Slices of salty smoked salmon were set off by a nutty cake of Asian rice, wasabi paste and a teriyaki dipping sauce.</p>
        <p>For main courses, we ordered steak both nights and came away a little disappointed each time. The meat itself was not deeply flavorful, and while on one night blue-cheese butter took care of that problem, on the other the garnish was an off-putting mixture of candied lemon peel and nearly raw onion. The accompanying potatoes -- scalloped one night, mashed the other -- were satisfying. But the fresh vegetables, asparagus one night and snap peas the other, were undercooked and unadorned.</p>
        <p>Doneness was a constant problem with the main courses. One of those steaks was so blue in the center that we sent it back for another turn under the broiler. Lamb chops, ordered rare to medium-rare, were almost raw in spots. A tuna steak was overcooked to the point of dryness.</p>
        <p>Grilled duck, on the other hand, worked well twice even though it was more done than a duck fan might like. Each night it was served with a fruit chutney: cranberry-ginger one time, apple-blueberry the other. The sweet spiciness of the chutney offset the fattiness of the duck, which was moist and gamy. Those lamb chops, though undercooked, were deliciously muttony, and they came atop a pillow of white beans in a vinaigrette enhanced by the lavender I'd seen a staff member cutting in the Cafe's garden just an hour earlier.</p>
        <p>Desserts continue in the comfort-food vein. The restaurant's signature dessert, butterscotch pudding with whipped cream in an old-fashioned sundae glass, is made with authentic (and highly caloric) ingredients, but I'm afraid it's just butterscotch pudding. We did enjoy a CD-sized Key lime tart with caramelized lime peel, a slice of banana-coconut cheesecake, and a huge slab of chocolate layer cake straight out of Better Homes &amp; Gardens, circa 1950.</p>
        <p>The point of dessert here, however, is not so much to eat it as to linger over it with a cup of tea or coffee, leaning back in your slightly rickety chair and letting the eddies of conversation swirl around you in the soft light. This has been a long and restful evening, and you don't want it to end.</p>
