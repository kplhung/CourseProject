        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I pose an issue that should concern all reviewers of nonfiction books. It's about a reviewer's responsibility to validate an author's writings. Too often, claims made by authors are repeated as fact when there is only the author's word for it. Isn't it incumbent upon the reviewer to sort this all out, especially when serious accusations are made? When charges are made in a book against a third party, should not the reviewer attempt to elicit a reaction from the target, just as any responsible journalist would do?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I pose an issue that should concern all reviewers of nonfiction books. It's about a reviewer's responsibility to validate an author's writings. Too often, claims made by authors are repeated as fact when there is only the author's word for it. Isn't it incumbent upon the reviewer to sort this all out, especially when serious accusations are made? When charges are made in a book against a third party, should not the reviewer attempt to elicit a reaction from the target, just as any responsible journalist would do?</p>
        <p>I draw your attention to a review of Betty Friedan's memoirs, ''Life So Far'' (June 25), in which the author accuses her then husband of spousal abuse. That's a serious charge, which the reviewer repeats as if it were gospel, stating unequivocally that ''throughout her years of activism Betty Friedan allowed her husband to get away with beating her.'' How does the reviewer know this to be true?</p>
        <p>Her husband maintains that this is an outright falsehood that Betty Friedan, in print interviews and on television, has since tried to take back. Everywhere she keeps repeating this line: ''He was no wife beater.''</p>
        <p>That same Sunday the review appeared, The New York Times on Page 2 of the main section acknowledged that on the matter of this alleged abuse the reviewer should have included Mr. Friedan's blanket denial. An editors' note reported that Mr. Friedan has stated that the accusation is ''blatantly untrue.''</p>
        <p>I hope reviewers will take heed.</p>
        <p>Carl Friedan  Sarasota, Fla.</p>
