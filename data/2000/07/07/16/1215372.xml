      <abstract>
        <p>Jonathan Fuerbringer Portfolios Etc column notes small number of economists and strategists see conditions ripe for mild 'stagflation,' or rising inflation in a slowing economy, if Federal Reserve moves unexpectedly or goes too far in its tightening of monetary policy; graph (M)</p>

        <p>REMEMBER stagflation? That's when the economy slows and inflation rises -- the worst of both worlds. It was the curse of the mid-1970's, as the economy fell into recession and the Consumer Price Index rose 12.3 percent in a single year, 1974.

        <p>Inflation has come way down since then, and the economy is now in the longest period of continuous growth on record. So who's talking about stagflation? Not many people -- and that may be a problem.</p>

        <p>REMEMBER stagflation? That's when the economy slows and inflation rises -- the worst of both worlds. It was the curse of the mid-1970's, as the economy fell into recession and the Consumer Price Index rose 12.3 percent in a single year, 1974. And it returned in 1980, when the C.P.I. jumped 12.5 percent while the economy ground to a halt.</p>
        <p>Inflation has come way down since then, and the economy is now in the longest period of continuous growth on record. So who's talking about stagflation? Not many people -- and that may be a problem.</p>
        <p>Now, the few who are talking are not predicting anything like the stagflation of yore. But they are saying that investors could face a period of slowing economic growth, which they equate loosely with stagnation, and of rising prices, which is inflation. They warn that increases in unit labor costs associated with this more benign stagflation will also cut into corporate earnings. But the  stock and bond markets have not yet factored this in; instead, Wall Street forecasters still expect earnings to grow this year at the quickest annual pace since 1993.</p>
        <p>At the worst, this small group of worried economists and strategists adds, the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates higher than is now expected, in response to reports of a climbing C.P.I. That extra tightening could push the the economy into a recession.</p>
        <p>How could this happen, especially when many Wall Street strategists think that the Fed is guiding the economy to a soft landing,  slowing it down to a manageable but still positive pace?</p>
        <p>To begin with, a slowdown in economic growth would set off a decline in the growth rate of worker productivity, measured by the value of output for each hour worked. In the last two quarters of 1999, productivity surged, rising an annual rate of 5 and 6.9 percent, respectively. Unit labor costs declined during those quarters, by 0.3 and 2.9 percent. Corporate earnings, meanwhile surged 22.7 and 21.4 percent.</p>
        <p>But with economic growth slowing, productivity gains will shrink, said Paul A. McCulley, a portfolio manager at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a bond powerhouse in Newport Beach, Calif. That would happen because companies do not shed workers quickly as demand for products slackens. Indeed, with workers so difficult to find these days, few employers would be willing to consider layoffs at the first sign of a slowdown. So the same number of workers would be producing fewer goods, and that works out to lower productivity.</p>
        <p>Smaller productivity gains mean that unit labor costs, which equal total worker compensation minus productivity, would rise. In the first quarter of this year, productivity gains slowed to 2.4 percent while unit labor costs rose 1.6 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While corporate profits remained strong, the C.P.I., not counting prices for food and energy, jumped at a compound annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>FACED with rising unit labor costs, companies have two choices. They can pass them on to consumers in higher prices, which adds to inflationary pressures, or they can absorb them -- because of competitive fears -- and reduce their profits.</p>
        <p>It is also likely that workers will be pushing for wage increases to compensate them for the high productivity gains of the last few years. Pay raises are usually backward-looking, because they are based on profits the company has already made.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCulley says the period -- or ''interregnum'' -- of rising prices and slowing growth should not last long, provided that the Fed does not raise interest rates too much and cause a recession. On the far side, an economy with inflation again in check and the Fed on hold will be good for stocks.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''the equity market has not embraced an interregnum of stagflation.'' Equities, he said, are already overpriced for the shock of rising inflation and slowing growth; if the Fed tightens too much in response to an inflationary spurt, he sees stocks headed for disaster.</p>
