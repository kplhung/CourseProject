      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Cheryl Allen and Justin Allen,  Mt. Vernon, Tex.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Allen: I adopted Justin in '83. We had no idea of what he looked like. We didn't care. They told us his mother was Spanish and probably Oriental too, but we do not know who his father was.</p>
        <p>It's something I don't talk about, because as far as I'm concerned, he's been with me from 8 days old, he is an American and that's all that counts. I never worried about having him in this town; I felt like, because of me, they probably would treat him well. But they're very prejudiced in this town against anyone that does not fit in a redneck mold.</p>
        <p>My personal opinion is Justin will never find someone here. He'll go off to college somewhere where there's more acceptance, and that will be where he will find his soul mate. Things will be better for him than they are right now.</p>
        <p>Justin Allen: At our school there's basically no mixing. You're white and you have all white friends; you're Mexican, you have Mexican friends; you're black, you have black friends. It's always on your mind; you're constantly aware that you're different.</p>
        <p>That's where the confusing part comes in. When I was younger, kids would ask me, Justin, what's your race? I guess I was in denial when I was little. I knew I wasn't white but I didn't want to admit it to myself, so I would lie and say I just had a dark tan, or I was white when I was little or something like that. Being an Indian was better than being a Mexican so I'd tell people I was an Indian, knowing I was lying. Last year I finally said I'm a Mexican. I was nervous that it would get around school, because you hear so much bad stuff: people would say, ''Oh, he's pretty cool,'' and then if they found out you were Mexican it'd just all go away. Even my brother, who's white, is scared to tell his friends what I am. I try to dress as nice as I can because if I dress bad they're going to think, Nasty Mexican. But if I dress too nice, they're going to think, Who does he think he is?</p>
        <p>I think it's completely stupid when my parents are like, I don't care what he is, we'll love him anyway. I think that's so corny.</p>
        <p>My mom's family, they use the word ''nigger'' a bunch. You know, ''wetback.'' Or my brother unknowingly will say ''that stupid Mexican.'' But we always avoid the conversation. I wish I could just put it on the table, you know? I told my mom one time, when a Mexican pulls out in front of you or something you scream that old stuff at them, and you really expect me to be happy with what I am? You hear bad stuff about Mexicans so you automatically think Mexicans are bad. You kind of develop your own prejudice against your race. I'm really working hard -- just to get out of here, do the best I can. I just can't wait to get out of here.</p>
