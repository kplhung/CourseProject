        <p>Representative Merrill Cook, a two-term Salt Lake City Republican, is about as outspoken and unpredictable and controversial as any legislator in Washington -- so outspoken and unpredictable and controversial that even in a year when his party desperately needs to re-elect every House incumbent, he was denied renomination in last month's primary. His angry response to rejection: He just might run in the fall as a write-in independent.</p>
        <p>That threat left Republican leaders concerned. They reasoned that while Mr. Cook had paid a high political price for publicly feuding with them, members of his office staff and even his campaign manager, he still had a following and just might win running as an independent.</p>

        <p>Representative Merrill Cook, a two-term Salt Lake City Republican, is about as outspoken and unpredictable and controversial as any legislator in Washington -- so outspoken and unpredictable and controversial that even in a year when his party desperately needs to re-elect every House incumbent, he was denied renomination in last month's primary. His angry response to rejection: He just might run in the fall as a write-in independent.</p>
        <p>That threat left Republican leaders concerned. They reasoned that while Mr. Cook had paid a high political price for publicly feuding with them, members of his office staff and even his campaign manager, he still had a following and just might win running as an independent.</p>
        <p>Equally bad, they figured, even if he did not win he might draw away enough votes to assure the defeat of the new Republican nominee, Derek W. Smith, a little-known businessman up against a formidable Democratic nominee, Jim Matheson, son of former Gov. Scott M. Matheson.</p>
        <p>Not to worry.</p>
        <p>Maybe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook announced last week that he wanted to remain a member of the Utah Republican Party. In fact, he said, he wanted to be chairman of the Utah Republican Party. ''I could help expand its base, bring peace to the party,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The speaker of the Utah House, Marty Stephens, one of the state's leading Republicans, was left all but speechless.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what to say,'' he told The Deseret News of Salt Lake.</p>
        <p>But after a moment of reflection on a fellow politician he knows well, he offered this: ''I would counsel Merrill to take his time. He's had a bitter, bitter defeat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook's response:</p>
        <p>He remains prepared to jump in the House contest as an independent should Mr. Smith falter.</p>
