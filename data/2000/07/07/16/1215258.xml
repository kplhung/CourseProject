      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article last Sunday about the Polo Grounds reversed the positions Mel Ott and Bill Terry played for the New York Giants. Ott was an outfielder; Terry played first base. The article also misstated the field to which Ott hit many of his home runs. As a left-handed batter, he hit them to right field, not left.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the date Willie Mays of the Giants made a famous catch in a World Series game. It was Sept. 29, 1954, not Oct. 24.</p>
