        <p>Langer Biomechanics Posts Loss for Quarter</p>
        <p>Langer Biomechanics Group in Deer Park (Nasdaq: GAIT) blamed higher operating costs for sluggish first-quarter results and said it was ''not satisfied'' with its growth in revenue of 2.4 percent.</p>
        <p>The company reported a net loss of 2 cents a share for the quarter ended May 27, on negative net income of $43,923. A year earlier Langer had a 3-cent-per-share profit on net income of $82,271.</p>
        <p>The company, which sells surgical devices for muscle and skeleton disorders, said expanded promotion and higher salaries accounted for a rise in expenses. The company is also automating production, which should improve efficiency.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Gorney, president and chief executive, said, ''We expect that the increases in productivity and reductions in operating costs should have a positive impact'' from the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Stephen V. Ardia, chairman, added that ''while we have begun to see some improvement in the gross margin and expect to see this margin continue to increase, we are not satisfied with the top-line revenue growth of 2.4 percent.''</p>
