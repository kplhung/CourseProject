        <p>Rome has far less severe crime -- homicides, rapes or violent robberies -- than such other European capitals as Berlin or London. But petty crime, always a danger for tourists, is something to be particularly careful about during this Jubilee year, when pickpockets and scam artists swarm around pilgrim sites near the Vatican or the major basilicas, alert for easy prey.</p>
        <p>Tourists have been accosted by bands of urchins who swarm around their victims, poking them with rolled-up newspapers or pieces of cardboard, while others grab the wallet and pass it to an accomplice.</p>
        <p>Romans, known for demonstrativeness, sometimes serve as early warning alarms in public places.  When gangs of small children board a bus, strangers shout out to one another to watch their wallets and purses (''Attenti al portafoglio'' or ''Attenti alla borsa'' are the most frequent warning signals).</p>
        <p>The most dangerous time is boarding or getting off the bus, when jostling can mask a pickpocket at work.  But even on the bus, thieves have been known to slit open purses and backpacks with a knife; the No. 64 bus, which goes from the Termini train station to the Vatican, is particularly notorious.</p>
        <p>The train station itself, once rundown and poorly policed, has been spruced up and completely renovated for the Jubilee, and private security forces now patrol the lower-level mall alongside regular police officers. But the streets around it should be avoided after dark.</p>
        <p>The Porta Portese, a crowded and colorful Sunday flea market in Trastevere, lures tourists and also pickpockets. The prostitutes who years ago lined the Via Appia Antica have moved on, forced out by a renovation that has turned the ancient Roman road into a vast archaeological park, reserved for pedestrians on Sundays. But travelers driving between Rome and Tuscany or Umbria will spot prostitutes along the highway.</p>
        <p>Airports and train stations are jammed with freelance drivers, baying at arriving tourists, offering cheap rides. They should be avoided, as many overcharge extravagantly.  Even regular taxi drivers should be closely watched. Some can get around the meter by taking huge and costly detours.</p>
        <p>As in any major city, it is foolish to leave suitcases, cameras or even radios locked inside a car. Though many Roman parking lots that have been set up for the Jubilee have security, there are no guarantees.  Rome has one of the highest rates of car theft in Europe, so rental cars should not be parked unattended for long.</p>
        <p>The United States Consulate in Rome said that over the past few years, it has received fewer tourist reports of motorino theft -- incidents involving thieves on motorbikes who slash the straps of a pedestrian's bag and zoom away with it. That could be a result of tougher police enforcement, or perhaps the fact that traffic in central Rome has grown so clogged, even thieves on two wheels cannot be sure of a quick getaway.</p>
