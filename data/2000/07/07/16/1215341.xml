        <p>The June 25 article ''If You Bought the Brooklyn Bridge, Here's Another One for Sale'' mentioned my Web site, www.NYCroads.com.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, the site has provided information on expressways, parkways, bridges and tunnels -- built and unbuilt. News media have commented favorably.

        <p>The June 25 article ''If You Bought the Brooklyn Bridge, Here's Another One for Sale'' mentioned my Web site, www.NYCroads.com.</p>
        <p>Since 1996, the site has provided information on expressways, parkways, bridges and tunnels -- built and unbuilt. News media have commented favorably. Like any work in progress, the site is continuously checked for errors, using multiple sources (including correspondence from transportation officials and professionals).</p>
        <p>The article said I ''toned down some of the language on the site'' concerning the once-proposed Oyster Bay-Rye bridge. This is not true.</p>
        <p>Early in the Long Island Transportation 2000 study, sponsored by the Department of Transportation, the agency solicited recommendations, including cross-Sound bridges (Oyster Bay-Rye, Shoreham-New Haven). When notified about the story, I checked www.LITP2000.com and saw that only the Shoreham bridge was actually considered; the Oyster Bay location had been dropped.</p>
        <p>While I updated my site to reflect this (as of this writing, the D.O.T. has dropped all Sound bridges from consideration), my support for the Oyster Bay-Rye bridge remains unwavering. Indeed, my pro-bridge position is shared by 63 percent of Long Islanders, according to a Newsday-News 12 Long Island survey in February.</p>
