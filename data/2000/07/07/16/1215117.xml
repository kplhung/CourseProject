        <p>I've had a million opportunities to turn my life into a bitter, sour experience. If I picked a fight every time I experienced racism, it would take up my whole day. In the restaurant, I have people eating out of my hand. There are 40 or 50 nationalities represented on the staff, and I don't think I've ever seen a racial incident there. I'm black and I'm the boss, so you don't make race an issue. But then I go outside at 11 at night and I struggle to get a cab. It's a reality check. I laugh, because 90 percent of the cabdrivers are Pakistani and Indian. They've bought into this whole ''black is bad'' concept. And they look so much like me, if you put a hat on them, they wouldn't get picked up either.</p>
        <p>I was born in Ethiopia and adopted by Swedish parents. My Swedish grandmother cooked in rich people's homes, and she really inspired me. Everything was like a professional kitchen. As a black person living in Sweden, you knew about the black stars in America -- Carl Lewis, Mike Tyson, Michael Jackson -- not the ordinary people. I wanted to be in New York, in a place where there would be an Indian doctor, a Chinese lawyer, all different types, all integrated, where I'd see all different cultures just taking the subway.</p>
        <p>Racism, in a way, prepares you for real life. When I was a kid in Sweden, stuff happened. People would call you ''nigger.'' But it didn't put me down. I'm extremely driven, partly because I'm going to show people. But if I had been fat, they would have teased me for that.</p>
