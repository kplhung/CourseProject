      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IL FORNO, a warm, welcoming new restaurant in Port Washington, is the latest evidence that a long-established tradition is maintaining its vitality on the Island. This tastefully splashy spot of archways, pillars, murals and brick walls at 179 Main Street (516-944-0755) is the latest venture of the DiMaggio Restaurant Group, which until a year and a half ago consisted of DiMaggio's, a modest, conventional Italian eatery at 706 Port Washington Boulevard. Then, in quick succession, another DiMaggio's opened in Little Neck, Queens; Rudi's, a Central American-Italian tandem began doing business in Mineola; and Il Forno, the budding, locally owned group's most ambitious upscale operation, joined the three others.</p>
        <p>Many of today's most opulent Italian restaurants began in relatively humble surroundings and gradually climbed the ladder to luxury. Il Forno represents just such an assent. It is a notch or two above a neighborhood restaurant and displays a combination of homey reminders of its roots and signposts that hint at higher aspirations. Its economical regular menu, with all but one entree priced between $10.95 and $18.95, offers patrons value and basic Italian favorites: pizzas, pastas, parmigianas, scallopine, scarpariello; while its blackboard specials in the $15.95 to $24.95 range are on a more creative, refined level.</p>

        <p>IL FORNO, a warm, welcoming new restaurant in Port Washington, is the latest evidence that a long-established tradition is maintaining its vitality on the Island. This tastefully splashy spot of archways, pillars, murals and brick walls at 179 Main Street (516-944-0755) is the latest venture of the DiMaggio Restaurant Group, which until a year and a half ago consisted of DiMaggio's, a modest, conventional Italian eatery at 706 Port Washington Boulevard. Then, in quick succession, another DiMaggio's opened in Little Neck, Queens; Rudi's, a Central American-Italian tandem began doing business in Mineola; and Il Forno, the budding, locally owned group's most ambitious upscale operation, joined the three others.</p>
        <p>Many of today's most opulent Italian restaurants began in relatively humble surroundings and gradually climbed the ladder to luxury. Il Forno represents just such an assent. It is a notch or two above a neighborhood restaurant and displays a combination of homey reminders of its roots and signposts that hint at higher aspirations. Its economical regular menu, with all but one entree priced between $10.95 and $18.95, offers patrons value and basic Italian favorites: pizzas, pastas, parmigianas, scallopine, scarpariello; while its blackboard specials in the $15.95 to $24.95 range are on a more creative, refined level.</p>
        <p>Despite its impressive, towering brick oven, stone wall sconces, carpeting, white tablecloths and wall murals, Il Forno remains a family affair. Two of the three partners' wives are involved -- Eddie Marinelli's spouse, Marianne, who was an associate editor of Good Housekeeping, prepares some of the desserts (Italian cheesecake, tiramisu, cannoli cake); and Angelo Giannuzzi's wife painted the very prominent murals (speaking of homey touches, the wall's Tuscan scene was copied from the label on a Chianti bottle).</p>
        <p>It would be a mistake to neglect the basic menu selections. One or two of the tastiest dishes sampled came from there. So too did two generously proportioned appetizers, either one of which can be shared by a table of four. The cold antipasto rustico ($8.95) is an unusually diverse, imaginative array, including fennel with a light, lovely vinaigrette dressing, grilled rolled eggplant, ripe olive-oil-drenched tomatoes, roasted red peppers, black and green olives, artichoke hearts, asparagus, grilled marinated zucchini, mushrooms, slender baby carrots and red bliss potatoes soaked in olive oil. The pizza sottile ($8.95) is a razor-thin, soft-crusted delight that contains superior mozzarella and basil.</p>
        <p>Aside from single-order starters that will feed more than one, there's a splendid Caesar salad ($6.95), covered with sheets of shaved parmigiana cheese and a noteworthy figs al Forno special ($7.95). The latter, three warm halved figs stuffed with melting gorgonzola cheese on a pool of delicate white wine-tomato sauce, is a must order.</p>
        <p>There's another not-to-be-missed special here, a great veal scaloppini ($16.95), lightly dredged in flour, with an absolutely explosive lemon-wine sauce, large melting ovals of intensely smoked mozzarella and a hefty infusion of garlic slivers. (I sopped up that delicious sauce with a cushiony onion roll.) Timballo ($14.95), a muscular baked pasta thick with cheese, tiny meatballs and strands of braciola that was featured in the motion picture ''The Big Night,'' is a prime pick here. Lasagna della Nonna ($13.95), a tall square of meat, cheese and pasta layers swimming in a bowl of meaty tomato and cheese sauce, will also satisfy big-time eaters.</p>
        <p>Those inclined toward less filling fare should check out the linguine with meaty king-size green shelled New Zealand mussels, broccoli rape and a generous dose of garlic (an $18.95 special). Less interesting and successful is the Tuscan grill ($14.95), a thin coil of dryish, grilled sausage, a piece of moist chicken breast, white beans and chopped tomatoes (the last turned out to be a salad rather than the expected warm accompaniment.)</p>
        <p>I sampled two of the three made-on-the-premises desserts ($5.95), an unusually full-bodied Italian cheesecake and cannoli cake that turned out to be a good, gooey chocolate cake with cannoli pastry cream frosting.</p>
        <p>A low-key, well-informed waiter provided smooth service on a first visit, but a waitress who crossed the line between friendliness and familiarity proved to be intrusive during a second meal.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Per Un'Angelo opened last month in the Jones Beach Hotel in Wantagh.  The 65-seat Northern Italian spot is at 3275 Byron Street (516-783-6475). Its owners, Tom Ulaj and Elli Gjezo, and its chef, Thomas Aquinta, were previously associated with the Lisamarie in White Plains, as well as other Westchester restaurants. Per Un'Angelo features veal dishes and pastas. It has a castle-like interior with eight columns, green and egg shell white columns and cherry wood moulding.</p>
