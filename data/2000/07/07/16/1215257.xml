        <p>Now that triangular kerchiefs are so last summer, Elizabeth Cuthrell is going to the beach in an updated version with retro appeal -- a rectangular scarf tied around her head. As the producer and a writer of the movie ''Jesus' Son,'' which is set in the 1970's and opened last month, Ms. Cuthrell has been inspired by the fashion of the period. Her scarf is an ode to Rhoda Morgenstern, Mary Tyler Moore's beads-and-bell-bottoms-loving sidekick, and functions as a stylish camouflage for bad hair, too.</p>
        <p>''In bright colors, it's great around your face,'' she said. ''It also adds dash to the swimsuit, and you can use it to add color to a black suit.''</p>

        <p>''In bright colors, it's great around your face,'' she said. ''It also adds dash to the swimsuit, and you can use it to add color to a black suit.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cuthrell uses her yellow chiffon scarf (available at Malia Mills, 199 Mulberry Street, near Kenmare Street, for $32) and cotton print sarong by Hermes, which she bought in Paris in the spring, to accessorize her simple creme-de-menthe-color bathing suit by Chanel ($285 at Bloomingdale's). She prefers the modest shorts-suit style to a skimpy bikini.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel self-conscious in it because I'm covered,'' she explained. ''I feel comfortable going up and getting a snow cone in it.''</p>
