        <p>Dr. Paul Henry Mussen, a child psychologist who wrote a classic textbook and taught for 30 years at the University of California at Berkeley, died July 7 in Berkeley. He was 78.</p>
        <p>The cause was prostate cancer, the university said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mussen's books focus on interactions between parent and child, an emerging concern in the 1950's when the first of them were published; they were widely translated, and a number of them remain in print.</p>
        <p>He was the principal author of the seminal ''Child Development and Personality,'' first published in 1956. It was a standard for 30 years and made Dr. Mussen the best-selling author at Harper Textbooks for years.</p>
        <p>He wrote ''The Psychological Development of the Child'' (Prentice-Hall, 1963), and was the co-author of ''Roots of Caring, Sharing and Helping'' (W. H. Freeman, 1977), ''Psychological Development: A Life-Span Approach'' (Harper, 1979) and ''The Roots of Prosocial Behavior in Children'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989), among others.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mussen was the main editor of the four-volume ''Handbook of Child Psychology'' (Wiley, 1983). He also edited the Annual Review of Psychology from 1968 to 1973.</p>
        <p>Paul Mussen was born in Paterson, N.J., and graduated in 1942 from Stanford University, where he received an M.A. degree in 1943. He then served in the Navy until 1946.</p>
        <p>He completed his Ph.D. in psychology at Yale University in 1949 and taught at the University of Wisconsin and Ohio State University before joining the Berkeley faculty in 1956.</p>
        <p>He traveled as a lecturer and consultant to universities throughout Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and Australia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mussen is survived by his wife of 46 years, Ethel Foladore Mussen; a daughter, Michele, of Berkeley; a son, Jim, of New York; a brother, Irwin, of Berkeley; and a grandson.</p>
