        <p>CHARLES B. WANG. The mere mention of his name in this hamlet is liable to draw a crowd. The billionaire computer executive has become a favorite topic since residents discovered that he is behind a company that has bought up dozens of local businesses and homes.</p>
        <p>There are those who welcome him as a wealthy benefactor who will help revitalize a sagging downtown. And there are those who fear that he plans to turn the historic area into a money-making tourist spot rife with traffic congestion but with few amenities for residents.</p>
        <p>One thing, however, is shared by all. From the owner of a modest multi-family home who has refused to sell, to the Supervisor of the Town of Oyster Bay, no one seems to know what Mr. Wang (pronounced wong) plans to do. And that has led to a host of rumors, from plans to build a marina and vast waterfront tourist center, to designs for a ferry to Connecticut casinos, even a scheme to build a helicopter landing pad so Mr. Wang could fly to places unknown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang, chairman of Computer Associates International, insists none of these rumors are true. And he seems genuinely dismayed that so many of his neighbors -- he lives in Cove Neck -- would leap to the conclusion that he would do anything harmful. ''Why would I want to invest in the town and then trash it?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>His foray into real estate development, he said in an interview, was just another manifestation of his desire to do some good on the Island, like his recent purchase of the floundering Islanders hockey team. But while few doubt Mr. Wang's sense of civic responsibility, many wonder how wise it is to have so much of the town owned by one man.</p>
        <p>Since January 1999, Mr. Wang said, Island Properties, which he set up with Sanjay Kumar, the president of Computer Associates and a resident of neighboring Upper Brookville, has acquired about 50 businesses and homes in the 1.2-square-mile hamlet and plans to buy maybe 10 more properties.</p>
        <p>Residents have long complained that Oyster Bay does not feel like a waterfront community because an industrial area stands between the downtown and the bay. But one of Island Properties' major acquisitions, the Commander Oil Company, could change that. Commander Oil sits on the water's edge and has huge oil tanks that now block a stunning harbor view. Mr. Wang said that he had not decided what he would do with the property, but that clearing the land for waterfront development was a definite possibility.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang would not say how much he has spent, but sources involved in the purchases put the figure near $50 million. Most of the properties are in the heart of the four-block business district and farther along South Street, which leads to the water. The properties account for nearly a third of the businesses in downtown, and include a dozen single- and two-family homes, the oil company, a lumber yard, a beer distributor, a boat yard, a gas station and a former German restaurant.</p>
        <p>Many town officials and civic leaders bristle at the fact that representatives of Island Properties have been less than forthcoming about the group's plans during their periodic meetings.</p>
        <p>''He could turn out to be Santa Claus and really do wonderful things for the town,'' said Bob Reilly, president of the Florence Park Civic Association, which was formed two months ago largely in reaction to Island Properties' activities. ''But right now people are frightened because we have no clue about this billionaire who's buying the Bay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang said he has not presented a master plan because he does not have one. But he does have a vision for a revitalized downtown where historic storefronts have been restored to their Victorian splendor and where he and his family might be able to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon doing some leisurely shopping after a pleasant lunch, maybe even at a restaurant right on the water.</p>
        <p>''We want to maintain the charm of it and make it so it's an attractive place to live and raise a family,'' he said, ''so you can watch your children run down the street ahead of you and not worry about a thing.''</p>
        <p>He said he had no intention of turning what was an outpost for President Theodore Roosevelt when he summered at Sagamore Hill, three miles up the road, into a tourist town like Colonial Williamsburg.</p>
        <p>''I want it to be a destination place, but mainly for people who live here,'' he said. ''I don't want to live in Disneyland either.''</p>
        <p>Town leaders say that's all well and good, but until they see detailed plans, they will be wary. The supervisor, John Venditto, said that while ''there's clear evidence that he's someone who loves this town, two well-intentioned people could have very different perceptions of what's right, and that's why the anxiety that's out there is very real.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang said, though, that he has no intention of imposing his vision. He said that as Island Properties completes the acquisition phase and begins the planning process, it would seek local input.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to dictate anything,'' he said. ''We're going to evaluate everything carefully and come up with what all the groups in the community collectively think is the best for the town.''</p>
        <p>But given the reticence to date, many are dubious.</p>
        <p>''It's just hard to believe that he could be doing all this altruistically,'' said Denise Woodin, executive director of Friends of the Bay, which helped stop a marina and condominium development to the west of downtown. ''If he's a good businessman, which he obviously is, he's not going to buy all these properties just to fix up the facades and pretty it all up, as nice as that would be.''</p>
        <p>Others fear that having so much of the downtown in one landlord's hands could be risky. Mr. Reilly pointed to the actress Kim Basinger, who bought up the town of Braselton, Ga., only to declare bankruptcy and leave the town in the lurch. When Computer Associates' stock plummeted recently, Mr. Reilly said, talk turned to whether Mr. Wang would still have the money to do what he wanted in Oyster Bay.</p>
        <p>Lori Horowitz, who manages the properties owned by Island Properties, dismissed such concerns. ''This is Island Properties, not Computer Associates,'' she said. ''They're two totally separate entities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang's vision also seems far different from that of two other wealthy businessmen who bought up towns on the Island.</p>
        <p>Back in 1915, William D. Guthrie, the lawyer to the Rockefeller clan, and John E. Aldred, the owner of the Gillette razor company and Consolidated Gas of New York, bought and razed the entire business district of Lattingtown to make way for their sprawling estates.</p>
        <p>Then in the 1940's, John Ward Melville, a philanthropist who made his fortune with Thom McAn shoes, purchased every business in Stony Brook and then tore everything down to build a ''recreation of a colonial village.'' Dr. Natalie Naylor, director of the Long Island Studies Institute at Hofstra University, said the irony was that Mr. Melville demolished some authentic colonial buildings to make way for his vision.</p>
        <p>No one, it seems, has tried to do exactly what Mr. Wang has in mind.</p>
        <p>Over the next 5 to 10 years, Mr. Wang said, he would restore 19th-century facades on historic structures and refurbish newer buildings. He said he probably would tear down some structures and build some new ones. In addition to reviving the business district, he also hopes to broaden the supply of homes, possibly building less expensive housing for young people and the elderly.</p>
        <p>Despite the air of mistrust, there are residents and business owners willing to take Mr. Wang at his word.</p>
        <p>''Their way of revitalizing downtown, I guess, is to buy up properties and house them with the people they want,'' said David Lamb, president of the Oyster Bay Main Street Association. ''But I think they're also serious about changing pedestrian and traffic patterns, helping to improve the abysmal parking situation and really doing something to improve the fabric of the community.''</p>
        <p>He noted that Island Properties has hired a host of consultants to help devise a plan, including the arborist at Westbury Gardens. ''If they're willing to put money down on somebody of that stature, that says something about what they intend,'' Mr. Lamb said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamb also pointed to Island Properties' decision to join local civic groups in applying for a state grant that would provide $125,000 for a downtown revitalization plan that incorporates citizen input. A decision is expected this summer.</p>
        <p>''We're not here to be adversarial,'' said Abraham Poznanski, president of Island Properties and a former senior vice president at Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Bernstein, the owner of Bernstein's Home Center, a fixture since 1922, sold his building to Island Properties and said he was confident the town would do well by Mr. Wang.</p>
        <p>He said that had Island Properties not come along, he probably would have closed the business. Instead, at the urging of Island Properties, Mr. Bernstein said, he leased space back from the company and scaled the store down, from 10,000 square feet to about 2,600.</p>
        <p>''We're only still going to be here because Island Properties was so accommodating,'' he said. ''Now we've found the person who can restore Oyster Bay to its original beauty and who can probably bring it to a level that will make it a real walking town again.''</p>
        <p>From the days when Roosevelt would ride into town to cast his vote in an election hall above a Chinese laundry on East Main Street, and well into the late 1970's, Oyster Bay had a thriving downtown. Many businesses catered to the needs of opulent Gold Coast estates nearby, many of the homes housed the people who helped maintain the estates.</p>
        <p>But shopping centers and strip malls drew shoppers away from the aging downtown, where many of the historic storefronts have fallen into disrepair. In the mid-1980's the town's supermarket closed and moved into a strip mall up the road. Without the supermarket as an anchor, other staple retail businesses eventually left, too. Instead of butcher shops, specialty food stores and clothing stores, many storefronts have been replaced with nail salons and office space.</p>
        <p>''You can't buy a belt, blue jeans or shoes anymore,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''I'm not talking about faddish stuff, but you just can't get any of your basic needs and necessities.''</p>
        <p>There have been numerous studies on how to revitalize the downtown, but little has moved beyond the planning phase. ''I heard the rhetoric over the years,'' Mr. Wang said, ''but nobody ever did anything. So I decided I'm going to do something.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Poznanski, who has worked with Mr. Wang since 1976, said that while there has been little consensus over the years on how to revitalize the hamlet, ''at least we've been credited with getting people banded together because they're all so afraid of us.''</p>
        <p>Civic groups have been galvanized and Supervisor Venditto called a community meeting in May to discuss the hamlet's future. He also hired a planner ''to tell us our options for securing the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Poznanski said Island Properties set out to buy properties quietly because they did not want to drive up prices.</p>
        <p>Some have accused Island Properties of using ''very high pressure tactics'' to get people to sell, specifically pressing elderly homeowners by offering prices well above the market. One house on South Street that was bought for $234,000 about three years ago was purchased by Island Properties for $390,000.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Poznanski said rumors that Island Properties is going around town with an open checkbook are exaggerated. He said that the company had bought some properties that were in foreclosure and paid a premium for others, but also walked away from about 10 transactions because the sellers were asking too much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang and Mr. Poznanski said they knew that some local officials have felt slighted. ''But we're not doing anything illegal,'' Mr. Poznanski said, ''and we're not ready to go them yet because we still don't know what needs to be done.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Venditto said, ''The more sensible way to do this would have been to come and meet with the town fathers and to talk in terms of detail and to tell us their vision, because the town is the ultimate zoning arbiter.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Wang did not build Computer Associates into the world's third-largest software company by sharing trade secrets. In many ways, what he has done in Oyster Bay mirrors his modus operandi in the computer business, where he has bought up struggling companies and turned them into profitable endeavors while also expanding Computer Associates' base.</p>
        <p>Even though his actions have been deliberate and have been designed to give him broad discretion in planning, Mr. Wang said, those who see him as a big-time developer are off base. While he certainly does not intend to lose money in this venture, he is not in it to maximize his profits either, he added.</p>
        <p>He is willing, for example, to forgo profits and spend a little extra money to redesign a space if it means getting the kind of retailer the town needs to upgrade its quality of life.</p>
        <p>''I'm no Donald Trump and we don't presume to be experts in any of this,'' Mr. Wang said. ''This is just people who have a love for the place they live in and who want it to become something we can all be proud of. We have the resources and we're trying to do the right thing in the right way, without fanfare.''</p>
