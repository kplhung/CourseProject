        <p>Some child-development theory has long held that children's play is their work and their food is their play. So when executives at H. J.

        <p>Corporate America being what it is, the subject of playing with one's food was presented not very playfully at all. ''Kids had a particular need at mealtime that wasn't being met,'' said Deb Magness, a spokeswoman for Heinz. ''It was about having better control and more fun.''</p>

        <p>Some child-development theory has long held that children's play is their work and their food is their play. So when executives at H. J.

        <p>Corporate America being what it is, the subject of playing with one's food was presented not very playfully at all. ''Kids had a particular need at mealtime that wasn't being met,'' said Deb Magness, a spokeswoman for Heinz. ''It was about having better control and more fun.''</p>
        <p>It's one more sign of how children are driving decisions large and small, from the purchase of the family car to the packaging of food. But at Heinz, the ketchup (which is still made from tomatoes) seemed to have some appeal to grown-ups, too. A board meeting last week featured a few bottles of green ketchup, all of which seem to have gone home with the directors. ''I never saw a product disappear out of a boardroom so fast,'' said Ted Smyth, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Not far off: a rainbow of ketchup. ''We felt green had a little more kitchen logic to it,'' said Casey Keller, Heinz's managing director for ketchup, ''but the idea is to keep it fresh. Over time, we'll look at other colors.''</p>
