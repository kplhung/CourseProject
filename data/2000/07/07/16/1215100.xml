        <p>Dr. Donald Little, Burlington, Iowa</p>
        <p>We staff two emergency rooms here in Iowa, both in older, predominantly white communities. These are places where a lot of the residents remember when African-mricans weereferred to as ''colored.'' I've been addressed as ''colored.'' It's sort of like stepping back in time. In the emergency room, sometimes the urgency of the situation doesn't allow patients to think about race, but I've had situations where people are clearly taken aback when I introduce myself as a doctor. They're clearly uncomfortable. You see it in their body language: a certain look, a certain shift. They'll ask a lot of questions that aren't medically related: ''Are you the doctor? Is there another doctor that's going to come see me?'' I attempt to allay their discomfort. But it's a little more difficult with some of the personal attacks. I've had a patient's husband say, ''That little black boy needs to go back to school.'' That's not something that anyone can prepare you for.</p>
        <p>It's hard to say if their attitude changes after I've treated them. In some situations I've felt like the barrier has broken down. I'm not under any illusion that their broader perception of race has changed, but at least their perception of me as a qualified professional has changed. That's all I'm after. That they recognize I'm able to deliver quality health care.</p>
