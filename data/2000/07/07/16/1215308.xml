        <p>Swing and hillbilly boogie meet in the performances of Big Sandy and the Fly-Rite Boys, a Southern California group that visits the East Coast frequently and is set to release its fourth album, ''Night Tide,'' in August on High Tone Records.</p>
        <p>Roots-rock and rhythm-and-blues influences can also be heard in the group's unusual, sometimes upbeat, sometimes sultry sound that weaves back and forth between jumping jive to blues mourning. After more than a decade on the road and in the studio, Big Sandy and the Fly-Rite Boys were joined last year by Jeff West on upright bass and bass fiddle, adding a country twang to the rock and swing sound.</p>
