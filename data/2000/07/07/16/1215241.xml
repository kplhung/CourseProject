        <p>IT'S a sultry summer Saturday night, and Rich Chiarella is nuzzling up to his steady, Muzzy, while they drink a shared chocolate shake. Their heads bob to the beat of Bill Haley and the Comets' ''Rock Around the Clock'' blaring from a jukebox.</p>

        <p>IT'S a sultry summer Saturday night, and Rich Chiarella is nuzzling up to his steady, Muzzy, while they drink a shared chocolate shake. Their heads bob to the beat of Bill Haley and the Comets' ''Rock Around the Clock'' blaring from a jukebox.</p>
        <p>They finish their fries and steak burgers, saunter slowly across the black-and-white checkered floor to the parking lot, and slide into the seats of their black 1932 Ford coup emblazoned with blue, pink and lavender flourishes.</p>
        <p>Here they hang out, hobnobbing with the hip, ogling the chrome and the curves of the cranberry '51 Mercury, the scarlet '57 Chevy and the lime-green 1944 Ford that just pulled in.</p>
        <p>The only things that keep this setting from looking like a scene in ''American Graffiti'' are the fashions and the group's average age: Muzzy is 56, and Rich is 54, and they are well beyond the ''going steady'' stage. They have been married for 36 years. No one is wearing poodle skirts or bobby socks, saddle shoes or white bucks, or, varsity letter sweaters.</p>
        <p>But half a century ago they were, right here at the Sycamore Drive-In Restaurant at 282 Greenwood Avenue in Bethel. It is an institution in this quiet Fairfield County town, and it has managed to stay almost exactly the way it was when it opened in 1948.</p>
        <p>Now dressed in simple shorts, T-shirts and sneakers, these couples in their 50's and 60's cruise here every Saturday night from May through September to relive their youth. Many of them stay steeped in the 1950's all week long, making the rounds to other cruise nights around Connecticut: on Monday, it's a Burger King in Stamford; on Wednesday, the Red Lobster in Darien; on Thursday, Corey's diner in Woodbury; on Friday, Bill's restaurant in Monroe, and on Sunday an assortment of classic car shows.</p>
        <p>''It's like going back in time for us; it makes us feel young again,'' Ms. Chiarella said. ''A lot of us graduated at the same time, from Bethel High School or Danbury High School, and we used to come here in the 50's and 60's. So it's nice for us to come and reminisce about this and that, and check out all the cars,'' she added, her face cast in the orange-and-red glow of the Sycamore's neon signs.</p>
        <p>The Sycamore has been holding weekly cruise nights on and off since 1982, but the event has never been more popular than now, said Patrick Austin, who owns the restaurant with his father, Gene; his mother, Christine, and his sister, Kathleen.</p>
        <p>On this particular Saturday, about 80 classic cars pack the parking lot, from elegant vintage vehicles from the 1930's to super-macho muscle cars from the 1970's, all of them polished to perfection. Many have their hoods propped up, inviting classic-car buffs to lean over and marvel at the chrome parts and customized engines.</p>
        <p>''See, it's just great fun for everyone. No alcohol or drugs, just good clean fun,'' Mr. Austin said, watching a man hoist his 3-year-old son up for a peek at the driver's seat of a white 1956 Ford pickup.</p>
        <p>''That's my father's pickup,'' Mr. Austin said, in between the little boy's squeals of delight. ''My father has always had a great passion for classic cars; I guess that's where I got it.''</p>
        <p>It was that passion that led the Austin family to leave their jobs four years ago and buy the Sycamore when they heard it was for sale. Father and son were in the construction business, Christine was a teacher and Kathleen a waitress.</p>
        <p>''But we decided to take the plunge and do it because all of our hearts are in this place,'' Patrick Austin said. ''My mom and dad used to come here all the time when they were in high school.''</p>
        <p>Both went to Danbury High, his father graduating in 1957 and his mother in 1960.</p>
        <p>Inside the restaurant, Patrick Austin began an energetic spiel about the food and how little the menu had changed since 1948. The place was packed, all 75 seats filled, and he shouted above the crowd as the antique Wurlitzer jukebox spun old 45's (one play for 10 cents, three plays for 25 cents).</p>
        <p>''We tried to keep everything the way it was originally,'' said Mr. Austin, a 1986 graduate of Bethel High.</p>
        <p>One of the Sycamore's most popular original recipes, judging by the mugs lined up along the long soda fountain counter, is the homemade root beer.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how we make it,'' Mr. Austin said. ''It's top secret. All I can say is we boil it.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant has six full-time and 31 part-time employees. Bearing paper plates, the waitresses race around antique telephones and Coca-Cola coolers and past pictures of Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, Lucille Ball and the Fonz.</p>
        <p>''We can serve another couple hundred outside,'' Mr. Austin said as he walked through the crowd to the parking lot, the air spiced with the scent of felt pine-tree air fresheners hanging from rearview mirrors.</p>
        <p>A disc jockey, Nelson Zapata of Fishkill, N.Y., was playing ''Let's Go to the Hop,'' and outside, people were dancing or snapping their fingers.</p>
        <p>One couple, Dennis and Kathy Guariglia of Carmel, N.Y., beckoned the carhop to bring them trays of food to their white 1960 Impala with blue, magenta and green racing stripes.</p>
        <p>''It's just like Arnold's on 'Happy Days,' '' Mr. Guariglia said, ''only she's not on roller skates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Guariglia reached up to tap the big fuzzy dice hanging near the windshield and sighed. ''You know,'' he said, ''those days, they were a very happy time. You didn't have all the problems like there are now. That's why coming here is so nice. You forget about everything except just hanging out, having a good time. It's just a nice, simple way of life.''</p>
        <p>Just then, Mr. Zapata announced that Mr. Guariglia had won the award for best original car, and presented him with a plaque. ''This is fantastic,'' Mr. Guariglia said, getting a little choked up. ''It really is my passion, ever since I got my first car, a '57 Chevy convertible. Now I've also got a '65 Impala and a '47 Roadster. They're just beautiful machines.''</p>
        <p>The Sycamore gives awards every cruise night for other categories as well, including best custom car, best original truck and best hot rod.</p>
        <p>Best custom car went to Bill Romaniello of Stamford -- just call him Bugsy -- for his ''wineberry'' 1951 Mercury.</p>
        <p>''This man has put a lot of time and a lot of money into his cars,'' Mr. Zapata said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Romaniello, 63, a retired paint shop owner, said he visits most of the cruise nights and car shows in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, and sometimes he will even dress the way he did in the 50's.</p>
        <p>''Black engineer boots, the leather jacket, the dungarees with the cuffs turned up, the T-shirt with the cigarettes rolled up in the sleeve, the comb in the back pocket. The best thing about it is you forget about the obnoxious computer age we live in. You meet the nicest people, and just have a good, old-fashioned great time.''</p>
