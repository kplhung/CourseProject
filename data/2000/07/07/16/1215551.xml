        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, July 11) appears to assume that most forms and levels of education have one goal: job preparation. He suggests that the economy is so diverse that standardized tests will force students to be measured on matters unrelated to their interests and career prospects.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, July 11) appears to assume that most forms and levels of education have one goal: job preparation. He suggests that the economy is so diverse that standardized tests will force students to be measured on matters unrelated to their interests and career prospects.</p>
        <p>The education system should prepare students with knowledge and skills with which to begin their understanding of the world. If students have basics under their belt, then they will be prepared to specialize or change careers when they find they are ill suited for or unsatisfied in them. Standardized testing is merely an objective method by which cognitive output can be measured.</p>
