        <p>Betty Gbehi and Kim Hoffman,  Betty's Mode de France, Houston</p>
        <p>Gbehi (standing, right): I'm African, but I went to beauty school in Paris. In Houston, it's rare to see black people do Caucasian hair and black people's hair. But I'm used to everybody's hair -- Caucasian, Asian, African-American. I work for a TV station getting anchors ready every day. A new black anchor called me. She said, ''Do you know how to do black hair?'' She assumed I was white because I did the white anchor's hair. I said, ''I have a French accent but I'm black.'' She nearly choked on the phone.</p>
        <p>In the States when you say you come from France, especially for Caucasian clients, it gives me an advantage. They are impressed. Sometimes someone walks in and says to me, ''I need to talk to Betty.'' I'm the only black person, so they expect me to be the shampoo girl! It makes me laugh. Those things don't cut me down. I do find it insulting, but I don't take it personally. My African-American friends say to me, ''You don't understand because you didn't come from a slavery background.'' I never grew up in prejudice. There are things I don't understand.</p>
        <p>Hoffman (seated): I've seen Betty work miracles -- especially in Houston with all the humidity. It's impossible. There's something about her that makes you really comfortable. And her accent does help and the fact that she was trained in France. I see people come in of all races. I've seen her do every kind of hair, and it's great. She has head shots from all the newscasters, most of whom are white, and her hair products are more driven toward Caucasians. Just looking at the photos, I would have thought Betty was white too. I would think, just logically, you would go to a person of the same race. I have never gone to another Afro-American person. But you know, my hairdresser in Los Angeles is an Asian man, so there you go.</p>
