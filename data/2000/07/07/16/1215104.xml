        <p>Mary Riley and Marjorie Braggs, Louisiana Correctional Institiute for Women, Saint Gabriel, La.</p>
        <p>Braggs (right): Before I got locked up I had to carry things in my car to protect me at night, because some of the Ku Klux Klan in the area, they were pretty bad. About 1979, a young guy was walking the street late one night and they found him dead. Somebody had hanged him in a tree, on Black Lake Road. It was frightening, and that's how I ended up with a pistol. I killed my common-law husband's girlfriend with that pistol, and I was given a life sentence. Even though I take the blame for what I did, I had just bought that gun for protection. Mary's a sweet person. We have some whites around here, the older ones, that don't want to be bothered with you. It's a racial thing but it's under cover, because they don't want to get reported to security. For some people racism is a problem, but not me. I've always gotten along well with white people. I hate to say those words, ''white people'' -- I just think of people as people.</p>
        <p>Riley (left): I have two roommates, and one's black and one's white. We are very content with each other's company. In this kind of a situation -- both me and Marjorie have life sentences for murder -- I don't believe a person has any business seeing color. Because in here, we're all the same; these six numbers that we have makes every one of us equal. Doesn't matter what your crime is, your color or whatever. I come from the background where races don't mix, and I still, I mean, I have a lot of black friends -- but as far as ever marrying someone of another race, I would never cross that line, because of the consequences, if there were children, you know. There's such a color line between black and white, why bring a child into the world that's not black and it's not white and neither race accepts them? But in a prison you develop prison families. Like, at my age I'm a mother or a grandmother figure to a lot of the young girls, and I have black and white so-called children and grandchildren. I keep up with the news through the radio, and I don't like what I hear -- you know, the different things that are going on out there, possible race riots and race wars and the drive-by shooting things -- and there's many times that I say to myself, I'm glad I'm in here.</p>
