        <p>THE SOOTERKIN</p>
        <p>By Tom Gilling.</p>
        <p>212 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Viking. $23.95.</p>
        <p>''Pardon the stench.''</p>
        <p>As an opening line, it's not exactly up there with ''Call me Ishmael'' or ''It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.'' But the 19th-century penal colony of Van Diemen's Land (later to become the Australian state of Tasmania) isn't exactly epic territory -- or at least it isn't in Tom Gilling's jubilantly irreverent first novel. Like his countryman Peter Carey, Gilling isn't shy about applying a fun-house mirror to an old-fashioned adventure, playing sly modern games with appearance and reality. In fact, ''The Sooterkin'' may be the first picaresque novel whose hero, ''wet and slippery and covered in fur,'' is indistinguishable from a baby seal.</p>
        <p>The community into which Arthur Dyer is born on July 14, 1821, is not unfamiliar with the aberrant and the odious. All too often, Hobart Town is a vision of hell. ''Rancid with blubber'' from slaughtered whales that leave the harbor sand ''streaked like a butcher's apron,'' its air is ''smutty with cinders''; its slop-strewn streets are filled with ragged men who walk like ''spastic puppets dragging around imaginary leg irons.'' This is a place where you know spring is coming because the ever-present mud ''has begun to stiffen in the wind,'' a place where those few citizens who have the time (and the wit) to engage in religious and scientific speculation are confounded by the surrealism of the landscape they see all around them: ''Here is a meadow, hardly different from a meadow in Oxfordshire or Bedfordshire, but for the kangaroo. There a stream such as you might find in any English village, except for the platypus swimming in its shallows.'' So when a coquettish former prisoner named Sarah Dyer is delivered of a weasel-sized ''human monstrosity'' that she and the midwife swear is her son, only Mr. Bent, the editor of the local newspaper, is inclined, as he ungraciously puts it, ''to smell a rat.''</p>
        <p>Part of the strange charm of ''The Sooterkin'' derives from the fact that young Arthur -- who looks like a seal, barks like a seal and cavorts like a seal -- is so instantly appealing that you fear for his welfare in this beastly society. His mother loves him (''If God has sent it,'' she stoutly declares, ''I cannot turn the mite out'') and so does his 9-year-old brother, Ned, an apprentice street urchin who becomes Arthur's chief companion and protector. But others take a more sinister interest. Sarah's husband, William, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars with an abiding fondness for oysters and beer, is initially reluctant to acknowledge his paternity, yet he quickly changes his tune when it becomes clear that the public will pay good money to view his offspring. Arthur's talent as a primitive entertainer (a mewling that passes as song and a sporadic ability to fetch an inflated pig bladder) also attracts the attention of one of William's drinking companions, a French deserter with ''thin rascally lips and pale blue, red-rimmed eyes that remind Ned of a jellyfish.'' And then there is a visiting American, the sublimely self-important Boston surgeon Dr. Benjamin Banes, who proposes to take Arthur on an international tour and offers the astounding sum of $500 for the privilege.</p>
        <p>It's hardly a surprise, then, when Ned, who is in the habit of carrying Arthur around in a pouch made from an old trouser leg, is accosted one night and relieved of his burden. In the aftermath, Sarah retreats to her bed, immobilized with grief, but practically everyone else sets off in pursuit. There is even an official expedition organized by The Hobart Town Gazette, whose editor, despite his skepticism about Arthur's ancestry, is a firm believer in anything that will enlarge his audience. As the ragtag search party wanders the countryside, it encounters a host of other errant souls, most of whom will wind up on a moonlit, surf-pounded beach for an eminently satisfying denouement in which the forces of nature emerge triumphant.</p>
        <p>Oddly, Arthur's own exact nature seems, in the end, less important than the larger debates he inspires. While it's possible to enjoy his story merely for its raucous high jinks and sardonic asides, a few pauses with two subsidiary characters can be just as rewarding. Mr. Sculley, an elderly remittance man who rummages about in the fields and forests in an ancient frock coat, stuffing his pockets with dead lizards and mice and other trophies, is the founder of the Van Diemen's Land Scientific Society and an enthusiastic believer in the ''science'' of physiognomy. His presence in the colony is just one of the many crosses not so diplomatically borne by the Rev. Mr. Kidney, a potbellied prelate who shipped out from England to escape his creditors and make his fortune. Instead, he finds himself in a squalid cottage piling up new financial obligations as rapidly as he depletes his supply of brandy and claret, with only the taciturn companionship of his housekeeper, Mrs. Jakes (who moonlights as an abortionist and midwife), and his piebald gelding, Nelson, a sensitive creature who resents the chaplain in direct proportion to his increasing girth. Valiantly maintaining his sense of superiority, Mr. Kidney chafes under the conversational gambits of the obliviously chatty Mr. Sculley, who scours his medical books for ''cases of deformities caused by the excessive imagination of the mother'' and wonders if Arthur might be something called a sooterkin, a goblinlike animal ''born in centuries past to several women in Holland.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kidney temporarily escapes Mr. Sculley's uncomfortable dissections of the intricacies of biology, philosophy and religion (particularly the horrifying suggestion that Aborigines might be capable of performing acts of Christian charity) by taking off on a mission of mercy in the hinterlands. On his return from the bedside of a dying farmer, he encounters a band of soldiers who turn out to be brigands in disguise, and who seem neither Christian nor charitable. By the time he is scooped up from the roadside, ''naked as a puppy,'' by Ned and a witchy widow named Mrs. Slade (who become best friends after Ned tries to steal her horse), Mr. Kidney is too far gone to remember Mr. Sculley's lectures on drawing conclusions based on ''the evidence of our eyes.''</p>
        <p>Gilling has a great deal of fun with Mr. Sculley's arguments on behalf of physiognomy (''There never existed a profound thinker, or a man of fortitude and prudence, with weak, high eyebrows. . . . Long teeth are proof of weakness and pusillanimity''), but he also invests the novel with the full benefits of his own powers of observation. When we are introduced to Dr. Trelawny and ''his lips ripple like the skirt of a snail prized from a rock,'' we know Sarah Dyer is right to mistrust him. As for Sarah herself, think how much is suggested by the offhand remark that ''something about her lips suggests a pout that has fallen out of use.'' Midway through the novel, her dreadful husband is easily pegged in one sentence: ''A fretful look on his face announces that he has been thinking, or more likely talking to someone else who has been thinking, and the other man's thoughts have rubbed off on him, and now they're bothering him.''</p>
        <p>''Mockery,'' as Mr. Sculley insists, may be ''the enemy of true science.'' But Gilling's mockery, while often stinging, serves mainly to invigorate both his characters and his subject. ''We are a colony beset with Monstrosity,'' Mr. Kidney writes in a whining letter to the bishop of Sydney, ''so inured to the Unnatural that the Natural itself seems wondrous and terrible.'' And what could be more wondrous -- and sometimes terrible -- than the consequences of a mother's natural love for her child? As Mr. Sculley informs Mrs. Fitzgerald (the ''bustling, wattle-throated'' schoolmistress, whom we instantly identify as an agent of narrow-mindedness), ''If science teaches us anything, it teaches us to contemplate the possibility of everything, and the certainty of nothing.'' Then what does literature teach us? More or less the same thing -- and, in the case of a novel like ''The Sooterkin,'' that the possibility of uncertainty makes for irresistible entertainment.</p>
