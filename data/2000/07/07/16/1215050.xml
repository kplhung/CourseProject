        <p>An invisible past is a diminished one. Deborah Willis, curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian's Center for African-American History and Culture in Washington, has spent much of her career recovering the work of black photographers and trying to redress widespread ignorance of their accomplishments. REFLECTIONS IN BLACK: A History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present (Norton, $50), a historical and biographical survey with nearly 600 reproductions, is her latest effort toward this goal. Black Americans have produced photographs since the emergence of the daguerreotype, which was introduced in New Orleans by a free man of color named Jules Lion. Photography has always been practiced as a business, no less so by blacks who set up daguerreotype studios in cities or practiced their craft as itinerants. One notable example was J. P. Ball, a photographer and entrepreneur who established a large and successful portrait business in Cincinnati in the 1850's and won national recognition with his antislavery panoramas. Every style from the classic to avant-garde is represented in this book, and virtually every subject, including civil rights, spirituality, celebrity, culture and identity. Scenes of family life recur, ranging in tone from Allen E. Cole's rather stilted tableau of the 1930's, ''Home of Mrs. H. H. Sink,'' to the image of a mother-daughter face-off over the kitchen table by the contemporary photographer Carrie Mae Weems. In producing this handsome and ample book, despite its inevitable omissions, Willis has performed an important act of cultural and historical excavation.</p>
