        <p>AMY LEUNG learned to swim at Saxon Woods Pool here when she was 6. Now, 10 years later, she still comes to the pool, but she has more on her mind than her form while doing the crawl. On a busy day, she and her co-workers are responsible for the safety of 2,500 splashing, dunking, stroking pool patrons.</p>
        <p>Nigel Gardner, 17, recalls coming to the  pool as a 10-year-old -- and ignoring the warning whistles of the guards who told him to quit hanging on the ropes dividing the lanes, quit standing on friends' shoulders, quit horsing around in general.</p>
        <p>''I did not realize then they were doing it for my own good,'' he said with a laugh on a recent afternoon. ''Now that I'm in charge, I know it's not just empty authority: the rules are there for a reason. And when you make a save, you feel just so good about yourself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Leung got the chance to have that experience on her first day on the job. It was a month ago, on a sultry Saturday, and she had been a working guard for all of two hours. In the shallow end of the pool, in three feet of water, a little girl began bobbing up and down, looking as if she might go under. ''It seemed like she was in too deep,'' Ms. Leung recalled. ''I just went in and got her out.'' She added that she was functioning on a sort of adrenalized, automatic-pilot mode. ''I just wanted to get her out, which I did. She was fine. She said thank you and ran away.''</p>
        <p>Lifeguarding is the kind of job that onlookers sometimes don't take seriously enough. It's easy to fall into the stereotypes of the bronzed male guard lording it over a gaggle of admiring girls, or of his female counterpart baring lots of flesh a la ''Baywatch.''</p>
        <p>The truth is, it is a position with far more responsibility than many a summer job. The fact that lifeguard positions are frequently filled by teenagers does not diminish this responsibility: these teenagers have taken it upon themselves to -- well, actually guard lives. That there are pleasant perks -- sun, water, admiring looks from a sometimes worshipful public -- is undeniable, but there are also opportunities to prove your mettle, to go from being a carefree recreational swimmer one season to a professional responsible for many people's well-being the next.</p>
        <p>''It's awesome,'' said Patrick Mussolini, 31-year-old captain of the lifeguards at Saxon Woods, which is one of seven pools and beaches run by the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation. ''As a kid, I looked up to lifeguards. I followed them from chair to chair. Now I am one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mussolini, who works as an elementary school teacher in the fall, winter and spring, added: ''It keeps you in touch with the younger generations to do this. I'm their boss, but by midsummer we're like family. And these kids all have a great work ethic, a great attitude.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Leung grew up in New Rochelle, where she still lives. One of her earliest memories of swimming lessons at the Saxon Woods pool is of putting her face in the water, eyes closed, then opening them for the first time. ''They told me there would be stars on the bottom. They tricked me, but it worked. I learned to keep my eyes open underwater.''</p>
        <p>She also remembers practicing in her bedroom: ''I would lie on my bed and do the crawl.''</p>
        <p>After completing the course, she started swimming in her cousin's pool in Woodbridge, N.J. They played the standard kids games' -- tag, Marco Polo. They also pretended to be lifeguards: ''We had rules that we had to obey, and we took turns being victim and lifeguard. We yelled help, help, and we had to save each other and pull each other out of the water.''</p>
        <p>When she became a teenager, her parents told her that one did not sit around all summer doing nothing -- one worked. She decided to take a lifeguard course at New Rochelle High School; all year long, in the cold, dark mornings, at 7 o'clock, she would swim in the indoor pool. When the year was up, she received her Red Cross certificate, and this spring, passed the county lifeguard exam.</p>
        <p>''I applied for Saxon Woods Pool specifically,'' she said. ''I like this pool. And, of course, this is where I learned to swim. Although'' -- she paused -- ''I don't think I really thought of it back when I was taking lessons here at age 6 or 7. Back then, I don't even know if I knew what a lifeguard was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gardner, who is guarding here for a second year, is also a student at New Rochelle High School and took his Red Cross lifesaving course there. ''I was, like, it's cool. I'll do this instead of gym. It turned out that I got really into it.''</p>
        <p>His transition from carefree, water-splashing pre-teen pool patron to earnest employee was complete one scorching weekend day last summer when the pool was packed to capacity. From his chair, he saw potential trouble. Since then, he has made eight saves, but this one remains freshest in his mind.</p>
        <p>''A little girl and her older sister were swimming around,'' he said. ''The bigger one left her alone for a minute, and the little one went under. I looked, and my heart started pounding. I just focused on what I had to do. I went in, grabbed her in my arms and carried her out. I kept on holding her, even when we were out of the water and on the pavement. Pat, my captain, he came over to me and said: 'You can put the child down now. She can walk, you know.' ''</p>
