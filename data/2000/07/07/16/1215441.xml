        <p>Robert W. O'Leary, 56, who takes over as president and chief executive of Pacificare Health Systems on July 17, evidently likes to move around. In nine years, he has had six high-visibility jobs, including four as a chief executive. ''There's been a lot of talk that I can't hold a job,'' he said -- in 1995, four jobs back.</p>
        <p>Most recently he was chairman of Premier Inc., a hospital supplies purchasing alliance, which he helped to assemble in 1996 in a three-way merger of Premier Health, SunHealth and American Healthcare Systems. Mr. O'Leary had been chairman and chief executive of American Healthcare and then had the same jobs at Premier Inc. He stepped down as chief executive in 1998, remaining chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Leary came to American Healthcare in 1995 from Tenet Healthcare, where he was vice chairman. He had arrived at Tenet just that year from the position of chairman and chief executive of American Medical International, a hospital chain that merged with National Medical Enterprises to form Tenet. Before joining American Medical International, he was chief executive of Voluntary Hospitals of America.</p>
        <p>In the 80's, he headed the St. Joseph Health System in Orange, Calif. Small world: his successor there, David A. Reed, is now chairman of Pacificare.</p>
