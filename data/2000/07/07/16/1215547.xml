        <p>Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, July 11) makes the point that while education is becoming more and more standardized, the world is offering an increasing variety of paths for earning a living and contributing to society.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, July 11) makes the point that while education is becoming more and more standardized, the world is offering an increasing variety of paths for earning a living and contributing to society. This is one of the main reasons we removed our daughter from public school in sixth grade and began home-schooling two years ago.</p>
        <p>Most home-schooling parents I know are much less worried about school violence than about that ''one-size-fits-all system that needlessly brands many young people as failures,'' in Mr. Reich's words. In my experience, home-schooled children typically flourish under the guidance of parents and mentors, who help them develop their individual talents and interests into knowledge, skills and values that will serve them well in today's diverse world.</p>
