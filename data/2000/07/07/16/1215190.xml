        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>On the way to a run Off Broadway after three regional theater productions, ''Love, Janis: The Songs, the Letters, the Soul of Janis Joplin'' comes to the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor on Wednesday. Conceived, adapted and directed by Randal Myler, a 1999 Tony award nominee, and based on ''Love, Janis,'' a book by the singer's sister, Laura Joplin, the theater piece blends the songs that rocked the 1960's with letters Joplin wrote. Running through Aug. 6, it stars Catherine Curtin in the title role, and the singers Cathy Richardson and Andra C. Mitrovich. Sam Andrew, the founder and lead guitarist for Big Brother and the Holding Company, Joplin's original band, is the musical director. (631) 725-9500.</p>

        <p>Musical Theater Salute</p>
        <p>When it comes to wrapping musical revues into neat packages, little succeeds as well as singling out composers for tributes. Guild Hall's ''American Musical Theater Salutes Series'' begins today at 8 p.m. with ''Happy Birthday, Noel Coward.'' Lee Davis is host to the performers Steve Ross, Lewis Cleale and Lorna Dallas. Arthur Laurents, Tony Walton and the Rodgers family will get similar treatment. (631) 324-4050.</p>

        <p>Around the Parks</p>

        <p>Nostalgia Reigns</p>
        <p>Five concerts featuring the pop past make this a good week to get your nostalgia kicks.

        <p>Regis and Kathie Lee</p>
        <p>As most of the Western world knows, Kathie Lee Gifford is leaving the television show ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' But apparently not before she and Regis Philbin, her co-host, who has lately been creating millionaires, offer ''The Farewell Concert.'' Said to be ''the last time'' the duo will ''perform together live,'' the show pulls into the Westbury Music Fair on Brush Hollow Road at 8 p.m. on Thursday. (516) 334-0800.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- In one of those periodic quirks of fate -- and programming -- the classics dominate the musical scene with three concerts on tap: performing works that span four centuries, the Long Island Brass Guild appears at 2 p.m. at Bayard Cutting Arboretum in Oakdale (631) 224-5440; the Polezhayev Family, four violinists and pianists who emigrated to Long Island from Russia, appear at 8 p.m. at Morgan Park in Glen Cove (516) 759-6970; and Elise Sobol, pianist, joined by a trio of colleagues, offers a ''Summer Serenade'' of Bach, Gershwin and Mozart, at 8 p.m. at Mattlin Middle School in Plainview (516) 797-7900.</p>
        <p>TOMORROW -- Making the rounds of summer parks series, Plaza Theatrical Production's version of ''The King and I'' hits Allen Park in Farmingdale at 8 p.m. (516) 797-7900. The Rodgers and Hammerstein classic will be repeated on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Islip Grange on Broadway in Sayville. (631) 224-5430.</p>
        <p>TUESDAY -- ''Neighborhood Night in Oyster Bay,'' a weekly program that invites visitors to sample five local institutions that usually charge admission, gets under way with Raynham Hall Museum on West Main Street, opening its doors at 6 p.m. for tours, music by Long Island Sound and children's games. (516) 922-6464.</p>
        <p>THURSDAY -- The Disney Channel takes over the Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh for ''PremEARS in the Park,'' a mini-movie festival for families. Starting at 6 p.m. there will be games, live performances by acts like BBMak and Hoku and appearances by Disney characters. At sundown an original movie, ''Quints,'' will be screened before it makes it debut on Aug. 18 on the Disney Channel. (516) 221-1000.</p>
