        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>As a female tennis player, Venus Williams has achieved an important goal. As a member of a minority group, she is a role model. The only unfortunate thing is that in her exuberance to claim the first victory for a black woman in 40 years, she has shown an ignorance of the history of racial prejudice in tennis itself. Evonne Goolagong Cawley, a Wiradjuri Aborigine from Australia, won the Wimbledon women's title in 1971 and again in 1980. She won the Australian Open four times, Wimbledon twice and the French Open once. And she was most certainly black. Perhaps African-American would have been a more accurate description.</p>
