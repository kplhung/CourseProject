        <p>A man was shot and wounded, apparently by a New York City Department of Correction officer, after the officer was attacked and stabbed by a group of people on a Brooklyn street corner, the authorities said yesterday. The officer was critically wounded, they said.</p>
        <p>Investigators are unsure of the events that led up to the incident, which took place about 11:30 p.m. Friday at Howard and New York Avenues in Brownsville. They have no witnesses and have been unable to interview the correction officer because of his injuries, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man who was shot, Jovan Slater of 509 Saratoga Avenue, Brooklyn, was charged in two unrelated previous robberies after he was identified, the police said. He was shot three times and was listed in good condition at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, the police said. Charges against Mr. Slater in connection with the attack on the correction officer had not been determined last night.</p>
        <p>The correction officer, whose name was not released because his family had not been notified of the incident, was in critical condition at Brookdale Hospital, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police were seeking other suspects in connection with the incident.</p>
