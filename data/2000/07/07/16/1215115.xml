        <p>Ricardo Bazar, Calexico, Calif.</p>
        <p>I've been working as a border-patrol agent for three and a half years. Only 4 percent of the border patrol is Afro-American. But when you sign up for the border patrol, no matter where around the country you call home, your first duty station's going to be along the Southwest border. And unless you're of Mexican descent, in one of these border towns you're going to be a minority. And that would open someone's eyes to what it feels like to be treated differently just because of who you are.</p>
        <p>The funny thing is, if I'm in a white neighborhood in New York, there's suspicion. What am I doing there? Who was I visiting? It's the same here, it's just that my neighbors are not white. They are Mexicans. I've also dealt with people on the south side of the border who call me nigger. And I think, where did they hear that? On TV? In a sense, it's easier for me to do this job than someone who came from somewhere where they were the majority. They've never been in a position where they were different. For me, it's, Been there, done that.</p>
