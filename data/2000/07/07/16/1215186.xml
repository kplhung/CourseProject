        <p>Helen A Harrison reviews works by seven artists who transform found objects on view at Omni Gallery, Uniondale, Long Island, works by Russian artist Sam Ilachinski at University Center Art Gallery at Adelphi University and garden-theme works at Islip Art Museum; photos (M)</p>

        <p>'Transformations'</p>
        <p>Omni Gallery, 333 Earle Ovington Boulevard, Uniondale. Through July 28. (516) 396-0031.</p>
        <p>Although transformation is inherent in art, the process traditionally begins with a neutral material, like clay or paint, with which the artist fashions an object or image and invests it with significance. For the seven artists in this group show, their media are already loaded with meanings. Nor do they disguise the nature of their materials. Instead, they adapt found objects, with all their built-in associations, to serve new purposes in terms of both form and content.</p>
        <p>In Janet Nolan's ''Vigil,'' for example, wire coat hangers and screening never stop being just what they are, but at the same time they become something else by virtue of the artist's manipulations. Stapled to the wall in groups of six and covered with canopies of screening, the hangers suggest veiled presences, like a Greek chorus, only mute. Whatever they anticipate, they wait in silence.</p>

        <p>Although transformation is inherent in art, the process traditionally begins with a neutral material, like clay or paint, with which the artist fashions an object or image and invests it with significance. For the seven artists in this group show, their media are already loaded with meanings. Nor do they disguise the nature of their materials. Instead, they adapt found objects, with all their built-in associations, to serve new purposes in terms of both form and content.</p>
        <p>In Janet Nolan's ''Vigil,'' for example, wire coat hangers and screening never stop being just what they are, but at the same time they become something else by virtue of the artist's manipulations. Stapled to the wall in groups of six and covered with canopies of screening, the hangers suggest veiled presences, like a Greek chorus, only mute. Whatever they anticipate, they wait in silence.</p>
        <p>Less ambiguous, but equally minimal in material terms, is Eung-Ho Park's ''Sperm Spoons,'' a wall-mounted collection of familiar objects cleverly adapted. Scores of eating utensils, their handles twisted to resemble flagelli, appear to be swimming toward a common goal. They evoke sperm very effectively, yet remain identifiable as spoons.</p>
        <p>From a distance, Tamiko Kawata's elegant wire sculptures appear autonomous, and one wonders whether their inclusion is appropriate. Up close, however, the justification is obvious; they are intricate assemblages of common safety pins. Suspended in a graceful cocoon-like hanging, rising from the floor as a lacy column or folding into a self-protective embrace, the interlocking pins create their own support systems. Remarkable examples of adaptive re-use, Ms. Kawata's pieces achieve visual and structural complexity with minimal means.</p>
        <p>David Slater, Caroline Zebrowski, Paulette Singer and Seung Lee all rely on found objects with well-defined cultural meanings as well as deeply personal associations. Toys and computer parts play leading roles in works by Mr. Lee, whose quirky ''Cup of Tea'' installations highlight plastic bugs embedded in resin, and Ms. Zebrowski's assemblages symbolizing emotional meltdown and mental burnout. For Mr. Slater and Ms. Singer, collecting and arranging is a form of journal-keeping, with familiar objects placed in new contexts to enhance their narrative connotations.</p>
        <p>Sam Ilachinski  University Center Art Gallery, Adelphi University, South Avenue, Garden City. Through Aug. 10. (516) 877-4460.</p>
        <p>Twice estranged from his native Russia -- first as a forced laborer in Germany in World War II, then as a postwar emigrant who settled in Sea Cliff in 1952 -- Mr. Ilachinski uses art to express a spiritual connection to his homeland.</p>
        <p>In the two series here, one known as ''Interactions'' and the other collectively titled ''On Sight,'' he traces an aesthetic lineage directly back to Wassily Kandinsky, one of Russia's most distinguished and influential modernists. Not many people today are carrying on this tradition with such reverence or, for that matter, getting such satisfying results from it. The work may be derivative, but it is by no means slavish imitation.</p>
        <p>The influence of Kandinsky's early Post-Impressionist work is strongly felt in Mr. Ilachinski's ''On Sight'' series, reportedly made on a trip to Russia. The watercolors combine the spontaneity of firsthand observation with the precedent of Kandinsky's abstract formal vocabulary of the 1908-to-1910 period. Three different treatments of the same scene in St. Petersburg illustrate the variety of results, from luminous and translucent to bold and intense, that such a synthesis may yield. In the view of a tower and factory, the buildings provide a context for an arrangement of colored abstract shapes.</p>
        <p>A theory of shapes and colors functioning independently of objective imagery, articulated in ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' was one of Kandinsky's great contributions, and it has evidently inspired Mr. Ilachinski's ''Interaction'' series.</p>
        <p>From a basis in landscape and narrative content, Kandinsky developed a transcendent aesthetic. He is often credited with having produced the first purely non-objective paintings. Mr. Ilachinski uses those ''Improvisations'' as the starting point for ''Interactions,'' in which straight and curved lines, soft and hard-edged colors, crisp and indistinct shapes are organized in elaborate engagements. Some are predominantly organic in nature, while others stress geometric elements like those that preoccupied Kandinsky in his later years. Some compositions jell better than others, but on the whole the series fulfills its promise.</p>
        <p>'Eden Revisited'  Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip. Through Sept. 3. (631) 224-5402.</p>
        <p>Chosen by Rhonda Cooper, director of the University Art Gallery at SUNY Stony Brook, from nearly 300 submissions, this selection illustrates a wide range of approaches to garden themes. As Ms. Cooper points out in her catalog essay, the subject has positive and negative connotations. To one artist it signifies growth and renewal, to another it represents the struggle of order against chaos, and to another it symbolizes betrayal and the loss of innocence.</p>
        <p>That ambivalence is nicely summarized in Kris Giulianelli's untitled photograph of a circle of empty garden chairs in a concrete courtyard. Hemmed in by anonymous buildings, the space is deserted, as if all life had fled from its barren confines. In this reading, Eden is a protected space but also a hermetic one, sterile rather than fertile, stripped down to reveal its prison-like essence.</p>
        <p>''Rose Garden,'' an impressive installation by H. N. Semjon, imprisons the plants themselves, and one wonders whether there is any significance in the fact that several of the roses are of the variety Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
        <p>Janet Culbertson takes an even bleaker view in her vignettes of so-called industrial gardens, where cooling towers and skyscrapers have replaced trees, highways snake across the landscape, the human population grows like weeds and planes instead of birds fly overhead.  As if to invoke the biblical warning, ''As ye sow, so shall ye reap,'' Ms. Culbertson warns against the ultimate price to be paid for desecrating the garden.</p>
        <p>Not all is gloom and doom. Many of the artists explore the garden's bright side, as in ''A Garden Grows in Brooklyn,'' by Meryl Meisler, with its collage of fruit and flowers reclaiming a devastated urban landscape. In ''A Walk Through the Garden,'' Evelyn Kandel takes the viewer along a favorite path, stopping at intervals to observe and reflect on its pleasures, and to share them. And Louise Weinberg's ''Body/Landscape'' suggests that, even more than observation, sensation and emotion are vital to a full appreciation of the garden's delights.</p>
