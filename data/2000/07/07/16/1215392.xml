        <p>FOR Cyrus Mehri, challenging the status quo is second nature. His Iranian mother was punished in her youth for criticizing the shah. Asked to do a book report in the seventh grade, he chose one written by Abbie Hoffman. He cut his political teeth with Ralph Nader, organizing communities to rise up around issues like telephone rates. Even his birthday, July 14, coincides with a revolutionary milestone, at least for the French.</p>
        <p>So when he filed a federal lawsuit against the Coca-Cola Company in April 1999, representing four black employees who said they had been denied raises, promotions and other advancement because of their race, it was a fairly typical move for Mr. Mehri, who turned 39 last week.</p>
        <p>Coke mounted a vigorous defense, saying no discrimination had occurred. But as the case continued into its second year, investors, Wall Street analysts and others demanded that the company resolve it quickly. After  court-ordered mediation, the two sides reached a tentative settlement last month, although no details will be available until October.</p>
        <p>''Cyrus is an excellent lawyer in the sense that he has a very good big-picture feel for the dynamics of the process,'' said Hunter Hughes, the federal mediator who oversaw the settlement talks.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Mehri (pronounced ''merry'') parted company with three of the plaintiffs, whose number had grown to eight earlier this year. Along with a fourth plaintiff, they are now represented by Willie E. Gary, a Florida personal-injury specialist who has said that he can get more money for the employees  than Mr. Mehri is seeking. The split has created confusion among the estimated 2,000 current and former Coke employees who would be covered by the settlement, and some have said they plan to opt out and file new lawsuits.</p>
        <p>In a minor victory for Mr. Mehri, Mr. Gary was ordered last week by the judge, Richard W. Story of Federal District Court in Atlanta, not to solicit retainers or to invite the employees to meetings. ''I have no problems with that,'' Mr. Gary said. ''We're not going to sign anybody up until they have a chance to see this phantom settlement.'' He has filed a discrimination lawsuit in Georgia state court, asking for $1.5 billion in damages for four former  Coke employees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehri maintains that once the settlement terms are public, plaintiffs and employees will be pleased. ''When the fog clears this fall,'' he said, ''the narrow interests of a few will be eclipsed by the movement of the many.''</p>
        <p>The case against Coke was the first for his law firm, Mehri, Malkin &amp; Ross, which he opened in September 1998. ''People thought I was crazy to risk the future of my firm on this case,'' Mr. Mehri said. But he was confident that his case was solid.</p>
        <p>About six months earlier, he received a telephone call from Linda Ingram, an information systems analyst at Coke, who felt that the company had treated her unfairly. Ms. Ingram had obtained his phone number from Bari-Ellen Roberts, a former financial analyst at Texaco whom Mr. Mehri represented when she sued the company in 1994, contending racial discrimination. The two sides reached a $176 million settlement that year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roberts, who is now a diversity consultant in Stamford, Conn., said that Mr. Mehri kept close  tabs on everyone involved in the Texaco lawsuit, and that he stays in touch with her to this day. ''He was like a guardian to us,'' she said. ''We had weekly phone calls that lasted well into the night.  When he was on his honeymoon, he was in contact the whole time, except when he and his wife climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.''</p>
        <p>In the Coke lawsuit, Mr. Mehri, who says he believes that successful class actions require a combination of hard work and lucky breaks, received a mysterious package in the mail that turned out to be Coke's human-resources database. Examining how black employees were treated, he concluded that they were clustered in the lowest-paying jobs; even in better jobs, they were often paid less than white counterparts.</p>
        <p>Larry Jones, who organized a boycott of Coke products this spring, praised Mr. Mehri for his courage in bringing the lawsuit. ''I was embarrassed that no black attorneys were willing to stand up and take on this lawsuit,'' Mr. Jones said.  But he also said Mr. Mehri had underestimated the anger of black Coke employees.</p>
        <p>Losing some of the plaintiffs to Mr. Gary, who is black, took Mr. Mehri by surprise, Ms. Roberts added. ''He saw that race plays a part in everything, whether we admit it or not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehri, who lives in Washington with his wife, Robin Anne Floyd, and their two young children, said every case was a learning experience. ''We did Coke better than we handled Texaco,'' he said, ''and we'll do the next case better than we handled Coke.''</p>
        <p>There will always be another case. But Mr. Mehri's vision for corporate America involves sweeping change, not the piecemeal kind. He would like every company to file detailed pay-equity studies by race and gender and what he calls a ''glass ceiling report card'' that would cover promotions.</p>
        <p>''Right now, no one is really going to look at their record, no one is going to hold them accountable and no one is going to enforce the law,'' he said. ''We can take the civil rights movement to the next level, and level the playing field at the highest reaches of these corporations. They let African-Americans in, but they don't let them up.''</p>
