        <p>A Girl With</p>
        <p>a Monkey</p>
        <p>New and Selected Stories.</p>
        <p>By Leonard Michaels.</p>
        <p>238 pp. San Francisco:</p>
        <p>Mercury House. Paper, $14.95.</p>
        <p>IT'S a brave writer who publishes two versions of the same story within a single volume. Held out for inspection, like slices of bream on a fishmonger's slab, each story serves mostly to expose the strengths and weaknesses of the other. Yet this is exactly what Leonard Michaels has done in his latest collection.</p>
        <p>''A Girl With a Monkey'' gives us two workings of a fine narrative about a gigolo waiter and a Marxist busboy at a borscht belt resort, and the result is predictably deflating for each. But then Michaels has always been a brave writer -- brave enough to stick to an unpopular and unremunerative form of expression, the short story, even after writing a popular and acclaimed novel, ''The Men's Club,''+20 years ago. And we readers should be thankful that he's stuck to it, even if he sometimes seems to want to ruin the whole experience for us.</p>
        <p>Many of the stories here have appeared in Michaels's previous collections, but they're worth rereading, not just as a reminder of his talent but as a demonstration of how, over the course of three decades, a writer can consistently innovate without really breaking with tradition.</p>
        <p>No matter when a Michaels story is written or what era it's set in, it seems to hail from the period just before the 1960's became ''The Sixties'' -- from a time when Jewish intellectuals were shifting from the labor hall to the coffee shop, with no vision of kibbutz or ashram ahead. And although Michaels has done his share of experimenting with amorphous narrators and the like, he has never lost track of a vital truth: there is always a story, and it should always be told.</p>
        <p>In traditional fashion, his characters, as erudite Jews, come from what Frank O'Connor famously (if apologetically) called a ''submerged population group.''+Because of race or religion or station, these characters hit society from a tangent; they are comets of a singular orbit and a disturbed plane. For O'Connor, their isolation was primarily a symptom of defeat.+What has always been curious about Michaels, however, is that he sees the fringes as a locus of power. His outsiders are usually more potent than the conformists, and they wear their marks of Cain proudly, whether they're in the lecture hall, the handball court or the bedroom. (They always get their shiksa.)</p>
        <p>So what actually happens? A whole lot of talk, wonderfully rendered, and a good deal of pointless violence. Lovers throw punches and blistering hot irons at each other, children fall off roofs, blood leaks from ceilings, fathers have heart attacks, women are groped by gangs of adolescent boys, men play handball as if their lives depend on bloody-knuckled victory.</p>
        <p>There are rapes and abortions. And although there's a fair amount of consensual sex, most of it happens offstage, and none of it sounds very rewarding. ''He talked too much, maybe,'' a character in ''Tell Me Everything'' recalls of her fling with a pretentious novelist. ''He was a tourist looking for sensations in the landscape. He couldn't give. It was like he had a camera. Collecting memories. Savoring the sex, you know what I mean? I could have been in another city.''</p>
        <p>Michaels often seems so determined to give us characters we can't identify with that he doesn't give us any we can enjoy being around, or even understand. But still we read on -- because the language is so good, and because we're rewarded for sticking with him. Michaels may sometimes appear obsessed with finding the emotional trauma in every interaction, but his obsession reminds us that such suffering is always there for the finding. As the narrator of ''Second Honeymoon'' puts it: ''Nobody gets through life without causing pain in other people. Not even St. Francis. How his father must have felt when St. Francis stood with no clothes and announced his conversion from the high life to the higher life. Lovable, surely, but I think of his poor father.''</p>
