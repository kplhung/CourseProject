        <p>A collective groan rose from the United Airlines check-in line at La Guardia Airport at 8 a.m. Monday as the announcement sounded from a loudspeaker. Because of heavy thunderstorms in Chicago, the disembodied voice intoned, flights to O'Hare International Airport would be delayed one to four hours.</p>
        <p>For Sharon Mantel, a drug saleswoman on her way to a meeting in Chicago, the day had already had a bad start. She hit a deer on her way to the airport from her home in Stamford, Conn., shattering her car's windshield.</p>
        <p>Ten days earlier, Jacqueline and Philip Clinton and their daughters, Caitlyn, 2, and Victoria, 3 months, had arrived four hours late -- without their luggage -- on their way to Long Island from their home in Spokane, Wash. Now, rescheduled onto an afternoon flight to Denver, they faced an even longer trip back.</p>
        <p>But for Cindy Miller, an advertising executive who has been flying at least once a week for four years, it was business as usual. ''It's just absolutely horrendous,'' she said. ''You just get used to it after a while. What can you do?''</p>
        <p>Last summer was the worst on record for airline delays, prompting the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration to swing into action to try to ease the burden on weary passengers. Yet despite those efforts, this summer is turning out to be even worse.</p>
        <p>Delays in June rose 16.5 percent from June 1999, according to the F.A.A.'s latest statistics. So far this year they are up 12.7 percent. And with air traffic continuing to expand at a time when few new airports or runways are on the drawing board, delays may be a fact of life for years to come, airline executives and government officials say.</p>
        <p>No group of passengers has suffered more of late than those flying United, the world's largest airline. Just under 57 percent of the carrier's flights arrived on time in May, far worse than the performance of its closest competitors, according to the latest figures compiled by the Transportation Department. Of the 33 routes on which flights were late more than 80 percent of the time in May, 27 were United's. And United canceled more flights in May -- nearly 9 percent of its schedule -- than any other airline.</p>
        <p>May was also the month that United agreed to buy U S Airways, the country's sixth-largest carrier, for $4.3 billion, a deal that would make it responsible for carrying 25 percent of the country's air passengers. Many politicians and consumer advocates oppose the deal -- which has set off a frenzy of merger negotiations among the other major airlines -- saying it will lead to a decline in both competition and service.</p>
        <p>United attributes its poor performance to a stretch of unusually bad weather and an outmoded air traffic control system that it and other airlines complain is not up to the task of managing an air transport network carrying twice as many passengers as it did 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the F.A.A. and the biggest pilots union ended a dispute over certain landing procedures that United said was responsible for some of the delays at O'Hare this spring.</p>
        <p>But there is more at work, too -- United's deteriorating relations with its employees, for example. Six years ago, the airline's pilots led a group of employees that traded deep wage cuts and other concessions for stock in United's parent company, the UAL Corporation, making UAL the world's largest employee-owned company.</p>
        <p>Without a new contract since April, many of the pilots have refused to fly overtime, forcing the airline to cancel thousands of flights. Both sides say they want to reach an agreement, but the labor picture could get worse before it gets better. On Wednesday, the contract covering United's mechanics, gate agents and ramp workers expired.</p>
        <p>''If anything our folks are doing is inconveniencing passengers, I am truly sorry,'' said Herb Hunter, a 777 captain and spokesman for the United branch of the Air Line Pilots Association. ''That can all be fixed if the company would step up and try to take care of its employees.''</p>
        <p>Another reason for United's difficulties, according to conversations with dozens of employees and executives over the last week, is that many of its internal systems, from its arrival and departure information boards to its baggage handling operations, have not kept pace with the airline's fast growth.</p>
        <p>Last Monday was a typical example of United's travails. At 5:30 a.m., violent thunderstorms converged on O'Hare, and the F.A.A. quickly reduced the number of arrivals there to 40 an hour from the normal 100.</p>
        <p>With that information in hand, under a new program that puts the F.A.A. and the airlines in closer contact, United began canceling flights. Like other major airlines, it uses a sophisticated computer program that determines which flights will cause the least disruption to passengers and the system if they are grounded. Ultimately, United canceled 354 of its 2,300 scheduled flights on Monday, 231 because of weather and air traffic control delays and the remainder for mechanical problems, unavailable flight crews and other reasons.</p>
        <p>By acting early, said Peter D. McDonald, United's vice president for operations, United can get word out to passengers about delays and cancellations. But it does not always work out that way. The Clintons -- she is a freelance artist, he is an Air Force pilot -- checked with the airline at 6 a.m. Monday before heading to La Guardia from Wading River on Long Island, where they were staying, and were told there were no delays. By then, of course, storms were threatening Chicago.</p>
        <p>''If they can predict four hours into the future,'' asked Captain Clinton, ''why couldn't they tell us at 6 a.m.?''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said that even if United could have correctly forecast the storms, it would not have been able to anticipate every delay. ''You can predict the weather and you can predict a thunderstorm, but you can't predict what the F.A.A. will do with the arrival rate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Customer surveys conducted by United have found that the top priority of passengers, after arriving safely on time, is getting accurate information from the airline. Yet because many of United's computer systems do not communicate with one another, its front-line employees often are in the dark when flights are delayed.</p>
        <p>Asked at 8:40 a.m. how long the Clintons' original 9 a.m. flight would be delayed, Willy Pena, a United customer service representative at La Guardia, looked at a computer screen and said 20 minutes -- despite the earlier warning of delays up to four hours.</p>
        <p>In the end, the flight took off more than two hours late, at 11:40 a.m. ''It is difficult to prove the point that we are not lying,'' acknowledged Graham Atkinson, United's senior vice president for marketing. ''But it may be that certain people at the airline may not know what other people know.''</p>
        <p>United plans to introduce a system -- at O'Hare by the end of the summer and systemwide next year -- that will link customer service representatives, gate agents and arrival and departure monitors directly to its main operations center in Chicago. Now, the information they receive has to be updated manually -- which means that visitors to United's Web site or customers who sign up for its new paging service, both already connected to the new system, receive more current information than United's own call center and airport personnel.</p>
        <p>Antiquated systems are also the reason United loses more baggage than any other airline. In May, it mishandled 6.71 bags per 1,000 passengers, more than twice the number lost by top-rated Alaska Airlines, according to the government.</p>
        <p>John Johnson, who is in charge of deploying baggage handlers at O'Hare and has worked at United for 31 years, recalled a big celebration a few years ago when the airline handled a record 51,000 passengers at the airport in one day. Now United routinely handles that many at O'Hare, its busiest hub, and 55,000 to 60,000 a day is common, he said.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen it this bad before,'' Mr. Johnson added. ''This year is incredible, and I said the same thing about last year.''</p>
        <p>In April, United began trying to hire another 600 baggage handlers at O'Hare. Front-line workers there are being outfitted with radios, and the company is installing scanners around its system to let it track bags more closely. Also, a new baggage connection center that is due to open at O'Hare early next year will link baggage operations directly to customer service. The goal is for bags to accompany passengers rerouted because of delays, something that rarely happens now.</p>
        <p>Just ask the Clintons. After their flight from Spokane to Denver was delayed on July 1, the family was put on a later connecting flight to La Guardia. But their luggage -- including car seats for their daughters -- did not make it to the new flight.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't leave the airport,'' Ms. Clinton said. Not, at least, until her parents arrived with car seats they purchased on the way to La Guardia (which the Clintons returned to the store after their luggage was delivered by United the following evening).</p>
        <p>Their trip home last Monday was even more harrowing. To avoid the delays at O'Hare, they were taken off the 9 a.m. flight to Chicago and rebooked on a 2:40 p.m. flight to Denver. After waiting at La Guardia for nearly four hours, they were delayed more than five hours more in Denver before taking off for Spokane. The family finally landed -- with luggage, this time -- after midnight Tuesday morning, more than 10 hours late.</p>
        <p>Still, the experience has not dimmed her husband's enthusiasm for the skies; he hopes to work for an airline after he finishes his service in the Air Force.</p>
        <p>''He won't be flying with a 2-year-old and a baby,'' his wife pointed out.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' Captain Clinton said. ''That's why I might try to fly for FedEx. No passengers.''</p>
