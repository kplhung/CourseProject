        <p>Huge shoals of frantic sand eels crowded against the beach in an effort to escape the striped bass, bluefish and hickory shad that were slashing through their ranks. The pursuit was so intense that scores of the small, slender baitfish were driven onto the strand.</p>
        <p>Sunset was an hour away and a gentle southwest breeze was at our backs as we cast over the barely ruffled waters of Vineyard Sound off Lobsterville Beach.</p>
        <p>At first, the bluefish and the shad provided most of the action. The bluefish fought harder, but the shad were more spectacular, flinging themselves out of the water and more than half the time shaking free of the hook. Hickory shad have been showing up in the waters surrounding Martha's Vineyard the past few years and have frequently entered the island's salt ponds.</p>
        <p>A half-hour after the sun slid into the sea, we began to catch stripers consistently. For about an hour, most of those fish were about 20 inches long, far below the state's current 30-inch minimum length for the species. (The daily bag limit is one fish, but one may catch and release as many as one wishes.)</p>
        <p>With darkness, big bass arrived, and before long we had caught several of them, including one 36 inches long. John Lehne of Los Angeles and Tim Stocco of Brooklyn were with me. Tim and I were fly fishing; John was using spinning gear.</p>
        <p>It seems clear that, in some Vineyard waters at least, striped bass, and large ones, are more numerous than they have been in a decade. On five successive nights with different companions, I caught at least one keeper and six or seven smaller bass. By contrast, my angling notes reveal that for the previous 10 years in the same area while fly fishing from shore, I had to catch and release nearly 150 stripers to get one that was big enough to take home.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening with John Houlihan of Claremont, N.H., and my son Jeff, there was a period from about 10 to 10:30 when every cast I made resulted in a strike or a hooked fish. Houlihan and Jeff, both fly fishermen, had similar good fortune.</p>
        <p>Southwest winds prevailed throughout these angling adventures, making conditions excellent for fly fishers. Each late afternoon when we arrived, we saw diving terns, sand eels flopping on the strand, and shad, bluefish and stripers breaking water along more than a half-mile of beach. On one foray, summer flounder, or fluke, added to the action, hitting any fly that got close to the bottom.</p>
        <p>Houlihan was almost content. He had caught many medium-sized bass on our first night together, but lamented that he had yet to take a keeper on a fly rod. On his second sortie, Houlihan caught several bass, including two keepers.</p>
        <p>For those interested, we took the bass on a variety of flies that had two things in common, being slender and sparsely tied. From two to four inches long, they had greenish-white or silver bodies and were intended to approximate the sand eels on which the stripers were gorging.</p>
        <p>My own favorite fly has two hooks, a silver, tubular body of Corsair, and a little bunch of blue bucktail on top, just behind the eye of the front hook. For a tail on the rear hook, I use polar bear hair from a small batch of it that a visiting Canadian biologist gave me several years ago. Such hair has a sheen that ordinary bucktail lacks. The stripers may not notice the difference, but I do. The hooks on this fly are small, No. 2 up front, No. 4 in the rear.</p>
        <p>I link the hooks with a short piece of 40-pound-test monofilament that runs inside the Corsair tubing. The monofilament, held in place by the fly-tying thread, will not slip if a little bulb is formed on each end of it with a cigarette lighter flame. Putting a tail hook on a fly is a bit of a bother, but it helps to hook fish that are striking short. The fly is four inches long.</p>
        <p>I use this fly on a floating line when fishing in eight feet of water or less and usually have my best luck with an extremely slow retrieve. Indeed, I often hook up with a striper when I have stopped retrieving, letting whatever current there is give movement to the fly.</p>
        <p>After-dark fly fishing for striped bass has certain challenges, including training yourself to stash various key items -- flashlight, pliers for removing deeply imbedded hooks, knife, leader material, leader cutters and flies -- in the same location on your person, night after night. If you don't do this, it's astonishing how soon you are enveloped in chaos.</p>
        <p>It also helps to establish a ritual for releasing fish. If the striper is small, you can hold it by its lower lip with one hand and remove the hook with the other. My own approach with larger fish is to slide them up the beach beyond the reach of the waves. I then kneel, remove my beret and place it on the beach as a sand-free resting place for my reel, get out my pliers and prise the fly from the fish, which is usually back in the water in a minute or less.</p>
        <p>I was so emboldened by June's superb striper fishing that I told some weekend house guests -- Susan and Joel Goldstein of Manhattan -- that if they wanted a striper to take back to the city, I would catch it.</p>
        <p>Given the go-ahead, I sallied forth at dusk. On my first cast I hooked a good fish that went deep into the backing. Beached, it proved to be a half-inch shy of the legal limit. Three hours later, I quit, having caught and released a dozen more bass, all smaller than the first.</p>
        <p>My first striper the following evening, after 20 minutes of casting, was about 28 inches long. At midnight I was still without a keeper. Waves driven by a strong southwest wind were getting heavier, and my casting was becoming ragged. I moved a half-mile to the west.</p>
        <p>''Three casts and I quit,'' I told myself. The final of those casts produced a 31-inch female, and scaled, gutted, partly frozen and wrapped in newspaper, she was on her way to Manhattan the next morning.</p>
