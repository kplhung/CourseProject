        <p>RICHARD RICE, a psychiatrist in Northampton, Mass., knows a lot about healing but not much about electronic components. So when he went shopping for a CD player recently, he was swayed by a salesman stressing that one model was ''ISO 9000 certified.''</p>
        <p>What does that mean, exactly? Dr. Rice said he didn't know, but it sounded impressive. The salesman, he said, vaguely intimated that it was an international seal of quality.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rice didn't get a lemon -- the store sold him a reputable brand with a solid warranty. But ISO 9000 had nothing to do with it. And it is just one of a flock of symbols, squiggles, seals and certifications popping up on consumer products that leave many shoppers baffled.</p>
        <p>A consumer might find ISO 9000 mentioned on most anything from a transistor radio to extra-virgin olive oil. But it refers to an international standard that has nothing directly to do with the product's quality, only with how well the company monitors its manufacturing process to ensure consistency. Critics of the standard's use in marketing say that someone could turn out cast-iron life preservers and still qualify, as long as they were all made exactly alike.</p>
        <p>The appearance of ''ISO 9000'' on labels is just one way that arcane international standards for product testing and certification are seeping sideways into retail marketing. With goods from all corners of the globe, often bearing unfamiliar brand names, confronting consumers, manufacturers turn to test marks and certifications to help consumers evaluate the safety and quality of what they buy. And anything that smacks of quality, however indirectly, is bound to be used for promotion.</p>
        <p>''Test marks exist for two basic purposes: to satisfy government regulations on the local, state, or national levels, or provide additional consumer product assurance,'' said John Donaldson, a vice president of the American National Standards Institute, the umbrella group that represents American industry in global standard-setting forums. Industry leaders and standards experts concur that many standards, including ISO 9000, are meaningful to manufacturers and purchasing agents but of little use to shoppers like Dr. Rice.</p>
        <p>Contrast such marks with the familiar UL label. Underwriters Laboratories, an independent testing organization based in Chicago, awards it when electrical products submitted by manufacturers pass safety tests. According to his institute's surveys, Mr. Donaldson said, UL is among the most widely recognized safety seals in the world.</p>
        <p>Almost as ubiquitous, but far less understood, is the CE mark. It represents a declaration by a manufacturer that its products satisfy the European Union's health, safety and environmental standards. Without it, a  product cannot readily be imported or sold in much of Europe.</p>
        <p>American manufacturers have complained that the CE mark is a trade barrier, intended mainly to make competing in Europe more expensive and cumbersome for outsiders. European consumer organizations doubt that the mark delivers the protection it implies. There is not even a consensus over which French phrase it was derived from, Conformite Europeenne or Communaute Europeen; some officials joke that it really stands for Confusion Europe.</p>
        <p>''The CE mark isn't a product certification mark,'' Mr. Donaldson said, because no independent tests are required to get it; a manufacturer need only assert that the product meets applicable standards and take legal responsibility for saying so.</p>
        <p>Cornelis Brekelmans, a European Union standards official, said that the CE mark criteria were established to harmonize regulations among the union's 15 member nations, not validate products for cosumers, and that meeting them can be just as trying for European as for foreign manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Not everyone regards the trend toward more testing and certification as a good idea, especially when consumers are the target. Guido Guertler, director of standardization and regulation for Siemens, is co-leader of an international industry committee working to purge the global market of what he says are redundant test marks (though he would spare some safety labels, like UL and a German equivalent, VDE). Mr. Guertler said consumers should put their faith in reputable brand names, warranties and service contracts, not dubious certification.</p>
        <p>SIMILAR views are heard from  some American experts. ''Consumers, as long as they operate within the traditional commercial marketplace in the U.S., do not really need to be concerned with certification,'' Mr. Donaldson said. Other experts say the voluntary standards promulgated by some industry groups are set low enough for all members' products to pass, and that endorsements handed out by specialty publications can simply be a quid pro quo for advertising.</p>
        <p>Add it all up, critics say, and the proliferation of logos, letters, seals and symbols can make for much  unhelpful noise.</p>
        <p>But Bill King, the Consumer Product Safety Commission's chief engineer for electrical and fire safety, warned that the absence of a recognized test symbol on an electrical product is a bad sign. He cited substandard power strips and cords without UL labels that entered the country in the late 1990's and were found to pose serious fire hazards.</p>
        <p>Mr. King said other examples of marks that conveyed important safety information to consumers internationally include the ETL mark from Intertek, another independent laboratory, and the FM Approved mark from Factory Mutual Research, seen on fire alarms and extinguishers.</p>
        <p>But what about nonelectric toys, a category of products on which the CE mark is often prominently displayed? It is not a ''meaningful'' safety indicator, Mr. King said; consumers should look instead for the  safety and appropriate-age labels required by American law.</p>
