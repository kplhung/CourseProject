      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Remember the Passaic Lighthouse? It was built in 1849 where the Passaic River meets Newark Bay. It's not there anymore, but there is a photograph of it as well as other lost beacons in ''Guarding New Jersey's Shore: Lighthouses and Life-Saving Stations.'' There were once 38 beacons dotting both the state's coasts (the Delaware had lighthouses, too); there are 18 still standing. Even the Statue of Liberty was a lighthouse, readers learn, from 1886 to 1901. The book is put out by Arcadia Publishing, which has produced books of old photos of towns in New Jersey and other states, sort of vanity publications with very local appeal. But through the research of David Veasey of Morris Plains, this one covers the waterfront. He tells readers that the United States Life-Saving Service, a forerunner of the Coast Guard, started in New Jersey. There are photos of early members and of stations, of which 20 stand. The book, in paperback, is $18.95 and is sold in bookstores or through www.arcadiapublishing.com.</p>
