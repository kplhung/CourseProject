        <p>Fusarium wilt has been robbing basil growers of pesto for a decade. If your basil plants suddenly wilt and turn black despite good care, throw them away with the soil they were growing in. This fungus persists in the soil for years and is likely to infect healthy plants. Buy new plants and plant in new soil. Next year, try seeds of the first fusarium-resistant cultivar, Nufar. If your basil crop is healthy, harvest it often and don't let it flower.</p>

        <p>Mulch plants to discourage weeds, conserve water and keep soil cool. Organic mulch, especially compost, also improves soil texture. Use foliar sprays of liquid seaweed rather than high-nitrogen fertilizers that encourage leafy growth attractive to aphids. This will aid plants' resistance to many fungal diseases.</p>
