        <p>Robert E. Dierbeck, a documentary filmmaker whose interest in science and wildlife took him around the world, died July 7 in New York. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The cause was emphysema, said his wife, Janet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dierbeck produced, wrote and directed films about a wide range of subjects, including oceanography (''The Earth and the Sea'') and anthropology (''Nomads of the Rain Forest'').</p>
        <p>His 1966 documentary, ''Flying at the Bottom of the Sea,'' about oceanographic research, won the Grand Prix de la Marine Nationale in Paris.  Early in his career, Mr. Dierbeck, who was born in Urbana, Ill., was associate curator of education at the Milwaukee Public Museum.</p>
        <p>After retiring, he served as a consultant for the anthropology department of the American Museum of Natural History. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lisa Dierbeck of Brooklyn.</p>
