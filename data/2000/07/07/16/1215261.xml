        <p>Roberta Freymann is a fashion designer and retailer who cultivates a buzz so quiet that it is nearly inaudible. To buy her airy straw hats and sequined bags wrapped in sheer net, customers come to a fifth-floor studio apartment in an Upper East Side art gallery building. She does not advertise. Women pass her phone number along to other women as if telling one another about sample sales or masters of liposuction.</p>
        <p>''I sell strictly by word of mouth,'' said Ms. Freymann, a 50-something Manhattanite. She owned coat and knitwear companies from the 1970's to the 90's, until she grew weary of her business responsibilities. ''I turned into a collection agency,'' she said.</p>

        <p>Roberta Freymann is a fashion designer and retailer who cultivates a buzz so quiet that it is nearly inaudible. To buy her airy straw hats and sequined bags wrapped in sheer net, customers come to a fifth-floor studio apartment in an Upper East Side art gallery building. She does not advertise. Women pass her phone number along to other women as if telling one another about sample sales or masters of liposuction.</p>
        <p>''I sell strictly by word of mouth,'' said Ms. Freymann, a 50-something Manhattanite. She owned coat and knitwear companies from the 1970's to the 90's, until she grew weary of her business responsibilities. ''I turned into a collection agency,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In 1998, she started importing pashmina scarves from Italy and Nepal, selling 2,000 that year and 15,000 the next. Now, at the studio apartment that serves as her shop (23 East 73rd Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues; 212-585-3767) she sells goods she finds on shopping expeditions to Europe and Asia. Most recently, she discovered straw hats ($180 to $290), far right, at a marketplace in Avignon, France; sequined bags ($45) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (center); silk jackets made from antique saris ($275), below, left, in Benares, India; and cotton coats ($200) from a quilt maker in Jaipur, India. She also offers silk comforters in bonbon shades of lavender and cream ($300, queen size); brilliant orange and yellow Indian cotton cafe-table umbrellas, glittering with tiny sewn-in mirrors ($25); and transparent silk gauze scarves ($75).</p>
        <p>Ms. Freymann is so laid back that she is not even fazed by shipping delays. ''Sometimes, things don't show up on time,'' she said, shrugging. She just sells them when they come in.</p>
