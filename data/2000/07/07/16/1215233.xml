        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There may be another reason Hollywood has produced so few films about the American Revolution. In 1917, after the United States entered World War I alongside Britain, a new film titled ''The Spirit of '76'' was deemed to impede the American war effort through its anti-British images (among the most violent were ''redcoats'' shooting women and children and, in one instance, impaling a baby on a bayonet and twirling it around). The film's producer, Robert Goldstein, was convicted under a sweeping wartime statute against disloyalty and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
