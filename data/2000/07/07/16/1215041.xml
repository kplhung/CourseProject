        <p>By Thomas Powers.</p>

        <p>SPYTIME</p>
        <p>The Undoing of James Jesus Angleton.</p>
        <p>By William F. Buckley Jr.</p>
        <p>305 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harcourt. $25.</p>
        <p>A SUCCESSFUL writer once boasted to me that he could teach any intelligent person how to write fiction on a professional level. But when he subsequently tried to put his theory into practice, he repeatedly found himself frustrated. His impulse was to blame his students' sloth, but I think he missed the point. Like the goldfish in its bowl, oblivious of the water in which it swims, this writer was unaware of his own talent, took its operation for granted, confused it with the functioning of his general intelligence. He refused to recognize that some inborn knack, independent of intellect, permitted him to write -- some storyteller's equivalent of a good ear in music or a good eye in the visual arts.</p>
        <p>These two spy novels -- a first fiction for Thomas Powers, the 13th for William F. Buckley Jr. -- are by impressively intelligent and accomplished men. But in neither case is the making of fiction the author's primary calling. Thomas Powers is a journalist who has received the Pulitzer Prize. William F. Buckley Jr. is . . . William F. Buckley Jr. Both men have made impressive contributions to our collective culture, and we are the richer for it.</p>
        <p>Of the two books, ''The Confirmation'' is certainly the superior. Frank Cabot, a career intelligence official, has been nominated to be director of central intelligence. His nomination is jeopardized when intimations of a dangerous secret from the past begin to emerge: Was an American missing in action from the war in Vietnam held in a Soviet prison camp? Were American officials, including Cabot himself, aware of the prisoner's existence? Did they fail to secure his release because cold-war politics rendered him inconvenient?</p>
        <p>Powers has taken his novelist's responsibilities seriously, has gone to the trouble of learning how to shape an extended narrative. But one wonders whether he has perhaps consulted some manual for first-time novelists, because the labor shows: he has constructed his novel the way a conscientious engineer might build a complicated machine. Still, the parts do fit together more or less neatly, there isn't much wasted motion in the thing, it gets where it's going with creditable efficiency.</p>
        <p>These aren't negligible achievements. The book is long, and possesses a large cast of characters and a multiplicity of interconnecting subplots. Despite all the ways things could go awry, narrative coherence is generally sustained. Except for a denouement too contrived and opportune to be convincing, the story manages to proceed in an orderly and persuasive fashion.</p>
        <p>And, as one would expect from a journalist who has written extensively about espionage, the details of the C.I.A.'s inner workings ring true. Given Powers's bona fides, it's reasonable to assume he would get the tradecraft right, and although I'm in no position to know for certain, it seems safe to suppose he has. There's no denying, at the very least, the plausibility of his account of agency operations.</p>
        <p>The prose, alas, also reads as if it had been put together by an engineer. Powers proves himself capable of writing a sentence like the following: ''But Vlad was an intelligence officer, and he certainly did not announce the object of his many questions about the file to be found among the records of the Soviet Division's counterintelligence staff concerning a certain K.G.B. officer named Mikhail Ivanovich Kondrashov.''</p>
        <p>More troublesome, the book never quite comes alive, never transcends its author's meticulous calculations. His characters barely qualify as characters; various familiar types are represented -- the Clark Clifford-like lawyer-fixer, the idealistic young C.I.A. analyst, the capable but cynical agency veteran, the ruthlessly ambitious journalist, the burned-out Vietnam vet, the Southern senator -- but they never get beyond the generic, they never breathe. They do what they have to do to serve the plot, and each has a collection of attributes provided early and consistently maintained thereafter, but at no point do they trick us into thinking of them as people.</p>
        <p>Aficionados of spy fiction may find the plot by itself enough to keep them reading -- the book is certainly never boring -- but for those of us who aren't already fans of the genre, ''The Confirmation,'' while craftsmanlike and carefully wrought, is a somewhat less than satisfying entertainment. And it has no apparent aspirations to be anything other than a satisfying entertainment.</p>
        <p>Buckley's book stands at the opposite pole. It's a book with a thesis: It purports to identify the fifth man in the Soviet spy ring known to include Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt. Since its proffered candidate, a real historical personage whose identity I won't reveal here, is safely dead, no legal action is risked by the accusation.</p>
        <p>However, before we get there -- on the book's very last page -- there are over 300 pages of storytelling that come perilously close to incoherence. We see the legendary and controversial counterintelligence expert James Angleton -- the novel's putative protagonist -- performing his exploits in Italy during World War II. We see him dealing with the famous (or infamous) Soviet defector (or plant) Anatoly Golitsyn. We lose him for a good long while to accompany his young protege, Tony Crespi, to Lebanon for a doomed love affair and an inconclusive brush with Philby. We are present at tennis games and drinking bouts and assorted illicit sexual couplings. But we get no sense that Buckley is tracing what Leopold Mozart called il filo, the thread, the line of artistic argument that carries us cogently from beginning to end.</p>
        <p>It may be considered symptomatic of the weakness of ''Spytime'' that the villain Buckley ultimately fingers barely appears in the novel at all until the very end. Because of the person's real-life prominence, the accusation is certainly newsworthy, if also dubious, but it's artistically unsatisfying, out of left field (or perhaps, in deference to the author's politics, we ought to designate some other section of the ballpark). The whole book reads like a series of disconnected and discursive improvisations on the life of James Jesus Angleton, with a shock at the end expressly designed to redeem the man's entire career. In the author's mind it may have been heading toward this surprise all along, but nothing in the text suggests it.</p>
        <p>Something else must be said. I read Buckley's first novel, ''Saving the Queen,'' when it first appeared, and rather liked it. But it contained the most risibly bad writing about sex I'd ever encountered in a work of fiction. With this new book, however, the author has outdone himself, established a whole new standard. Consider this: ''He had to say something, surely, about his knowledge that she would be sleeping in his own house. He didn't want to say he hoped she would be comfortable. 'Comfortable' is not the right word to describe quarters primarily coveted for sheltered copulation.''</p>
        <p>Or this: ''The only light in the room was what drifted in from the two sconces by the main door. The only sound was the purr of the air conditioner. She whispered to him, 'Will you love me here? Right here? Right now?'</p>
        <p>''Slowly he removed his jacket and, at his quiet direction, she composed her legs on the long couch.''</p>
        <p>Or this: ''She was seeing his back, profiled against the moon, and then as he swiveled his body with the curtain, she saw the placid remains of his ardor.''</p>
        <p>One gets the impression that Buckley, with limitless distaste, includes these scenes because he believes the vulgar demands of the genre necessitate them. They seem like passion observed and described by an alien, and exceptionally finicky, life-form. On the other hand, I also have to admit they're far and away the most enjoyable part of the book, by themselves almost reason enough to justify a recommendation.</p>
        <p>My reluctant conclusion: while Powers and Buckley are manifestly intelligent men whose work in other fields compels the greatest respect, neither here demonstrates much natural aptitude for writing fiction. Guys, don't quit your day jobs.</p>
