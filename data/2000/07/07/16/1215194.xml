        <p>Westport Art Festival</p>

        <p>Westport Art Festival</p>
        <p>Westport has been high on the arts since the 30's when the Theater Guild of New York City ran a straw-hat theater there each summer, and a decade later a correspondence art school opened in town.</p>
        <p>Twenty-seven years ago, merchants picked up on the cultural theme and organized an Outdoor Arts Festival that, incidentally, brought lots of people into their shops.</p>
        <p>Every year since, the event has been repeated. This year's edition will spread out over the downtown areas of Main Street and Route 1 on Saturday and next Sunday from 9 to 6.</p>
        <p>More than 130 artists will have paintings, drawings, mixed media, sculpture and photography for sale, and the shops and restaurants will attempt to entice strollers with special promotions. A sampling of the entertainment includes the Mystic Paper Beasts on Saturday at 10 a.m. and Rob Silvan and his jazz group at 2. Sunday's lineup includes Dodie Pettit's Broadway Revue and the Denns who play country music. Children will have their own art center on Saturday from 11 to 3 and Sunday from noon to 3.</p>
        <p>On the Trail of Terns</p>
        <p>The Essex chapter of the Connecticut Audubon Society has scheduled a cruise to Falkner Island, off the coast of Madison, on Saturday from 5 to 8 p.m. The purpose of the trip is to view the endangered roseate terns at their nesting site.</p>
        <p>While the boat circles the island, an Audubon naturalist will be on hand to talk about the life cycle of the hundreds of common and roseate terns that nest there.</p>
        <p>Bring a picnic supper to enjoy on way home through the Thimble Islands and, with any luck, views of a spectacular sunset. The fee is $40. Call (800) 996-8747 for reservations or more information.</p>
        <p>At Mystic, It's Boats</p>
        <p>More than 50 elegantly restored wooden power boats and sailboats, all built before the 50's, will gather at the Mystic Seaport dock all day Saturday and next Sunday morning for the seaport's annual Antique and Classic Boat Rendezvous. Costumed boat owners, captains and crews will be in attendance, ready to chat with visitors.</p>
        <p>On Sunday at noon, the boats will leave the dock and parade down river for three miles through the town of Mystic. Led by the seaport's coal-fired steamboat Sabino, each vessel will be announced as it passes through the bascule bridge, a structure that can be raised or lowered.</p>
        <p>From July 28 through 30, the seaport will re-create the America's Cup races of the 30's with 8-foot-long, 10-foot-tall radio-controlled models of Shamrock V, the Enterprise and other yachts of the period.</p>
        <p>The regatta will be held in the Mystic River off the seaport banks.</p>
        <p>Museum admission is $16, $8 for children 6 through 12, and free for those under 6; it includes admission to these events and to the 19th-century maritime village, seafaring exhibitions, shipyard and the only remaining wooden whaling ship.</p>
        <p>To reach the site, take Exit 90 from Interstate 95. Call (888) 973-2767 for more information.</p>
        <p>Authors on Their Books</p>
        <p>R. J. Julia Booksellers, the literary emporium and lecture circuit venue in Madison, has three author's talks scheduled this week. Hewitt Schlereth, a Milford seaman and author of ''Celestial Navigation in a Nutshell,'' almost guarantees to set you on course with sextant and chart by the end of the evening. His appearance is set for Tuesday at 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Hiding Places: A Father and His Sons Retrace Their Family's Escape From the Holocaust'' is Daniel Asa Rose's harrowing memoir, travelogue and spiritual quest, describing his journey out of Antwerp in occupied Belgium and a newfound feeling about his Jewish heritage. Mr. Rose was an award-winner for his short-story collection, ''Small Family with Rooster.'' His lecture will take place on Wednesday at 7.</p>
        <p>On Thursday at 7 p.m. Dick Lehr, co-author with Gerard O'Neill of ''Black Mass: The Irish Mob, the F.B.I. and a Devil's Deal,'' will talk about the violence, racketeering and indictments swirling around Boston's Irish gangsters, gleaned from the two writers' experiences as former reporters for The Boston Globe.</p>
        <p>There is no admission charge, but reservations are required by calling (203) 245-3959. The bookstore is at 768 Post Road.</p>
        <p>Tranquillity Upset</p>
        <p>An unusual film, ''Anima,'' will have a single showing at Real Art Ways in Hartford on Wednesday at 7:30. Sam and Iris, the two main characters, live quietly in a secluded New England farmhouse until a young man invades their tranquillity with questions about their escape from Nazi Germany more than half a century ago.</p>
        <p>The 1997 film was cited for its originality and its complex interfacing of the beautiful and the bizarre. It won an award at the Newport International Film Festival and at the New England Film Festival. Craig Richardson, filmmaker of ''Anima,'' will be present to discuss his work with the audience.</p>
        <p>Real Art Ways is at 56 Arbor Street. Call (860) 232-1006 for tickets, which are $7.25.</p>
        <p>Works by French Artists</p>
        <p>Four of France's leading contemporary artists are featured in Le Gala Francais II, the second annual exhibition of French art to be held at Gallerie Je Reviens, 1 Riverside Avenue, in Westport. It opens on Friday with a post-Bastille Day bash from 6 to 9 p.m. to which the public is invited.</p>
        <p>Genevieve Jost, one of the exhibitors, draws on her background as a gamekeeper's daughter in the animals that find their way into her imaginative paintings.</p>
        <p>Mo Gart is a multiple gold-medal winner in France for her mastery of light and landscapes, while Stephane Bulan, a former journalist and caricaturist, paints with vibrant colors and strong images that sell briskly to buyers in France and the United States.</p>
        <p>Windswept Mediterranean seascapes and landscapes are the forte of Kerfily, who uses only one name and has exhibited in France, Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States.</p>
        <p>Gallery hours are on Wednesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5. Call (203) 227-7716 for more information.</p>
        <p>Comedians on Stage</p>
        <p>Kotter is back, under his real name, Gabe Kaplan. So are Robert Klein and Kenny Kramer in the Connecticut Comedy Festival running from Thursday through Saturday in Waterbury. Each night at 8 p.m. one of the stars will appear on the stage of the Seven Angels Theater in Hamilton Park.</p>
        <p>Kenny Kramer, the person who was the inspiration for Seinfeld's neighbor named Kramer, does a stand-up comedy routine about the show, the development of its characters and neighborhood, and how his own life experiences became episodes.</p>
        <p>Robert Klein will work alone on Friday night and Gabe Kaplan will be the host of the Saturday night comedy laugh-off, in which the three professional comedians and some non-professionals will vie for honors. The event will be taped for broadcast on Connecticut Public Television.</p>
        <p>Tickets on Thursday are $32, Friday $35 and Saturday $30. On Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., a family program of comedy, magic, music and juggling will be held in the theater courtyard. Tickets are $7, children under 5 will be admitted free.</p>
        <p>Call (203) 757-4676 for reservations, directions or more information.</p>
