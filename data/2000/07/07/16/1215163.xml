        <p>Coming to Prague is like visiting a movie set, but you can find yourself with a bit part in a cliched story about stolen wallets, pilfered passports and outrageous overcharging, especially for taxis.</p>
        <p>Prague has never managed to regulate taxi charges or meters, and it's buyer beware -- or bemoan. Last year, even the British ambassador, David Broucher, complained to Prague's mayor, Jan Kasl, that his wife had been swindled by a taxi driver who charged 420 crowns (then about $14) for a ride of less than a mile and a half and refused to provide a receipt. The ride should have cost 80 crowns.</p>
        <p>Even worse, some taxi drivers have been known to lock their passengers in the back seat when they object to the fast-spinning meter, then steal their wallets in the confusion. The police here are polite but generally  helpless, because most of the victims are too upset to note license plate numbers.</p>
        <p>The scams are so notorious -- especially from seemingly legitimate taxi ranks in tourist meccas like Old Town Square, Mala Strana and near Prague Castle -- that one well-known Czech expatriate, the film director Milos Forman, and William Luers, a former United States ambassador to the country, sent an open letter of complaint to Mr. Kasl's predecessor.</p>
        <p>Little has been done, partly because of  high levels of corruption. Preying on tourists is such a popular pastime that one gang robs people on the tourist trams -- including Nos. 9 and 22, which run between Narodni Trida and Malostranska -- in daylight. A pregnant woman may ask for a tourist's seat, then the foreigner will be surrounded by four or five large men, who rifle the victim's pockets and hand over the goods to a young accomplice, who leaps off the tram while the tourist is detained until the next stop.</p>
        <p>Last year, city residents and tourists reported a loss of more than $2 million from more than 8,000 pickpocketed wallets. Those figures account for the people who bother to sit in the police station for up to an hour -- presuming they have an interpreter with them -- and file a report. Last year, police made just 420 pickpocketing arrests.</p>
        <p>The taxi scam is easier to avoid: Call a radio taxi company. The most reliable are  AAA (telephone 333-22-333), Profi Taxi (6131-4151) or Halo Taxi (4411-4411). They all have operators who speak English, will take your name and address and will tell you what brand and color of taxi is coming and roughly when it will arrive.</p>
        <p>Those travelers without European mobile phones can use telephone booths, which cost 5.40 crowns a minute (14 cents, at 37.50 crowns to $1). Most now only take telephone cards that you can buy at newsstands, grocery stores and tobacco shops.</p>
