        <p>Mhagony and Shawana Clark, video shoot, New York</p>
        <p>Mhagony (left): I think it's great how everyone is listening to rap, you know, Spanish and white people and all. I don't think that black people should keep rap to themselves. But even if I wasn't pregnant, I would never wear a thong or show off my body like a lot of black women in rap videos. And I don't rap about things that people expect me to. So many black rappers who live in the suburbs, they feel like they have to seem like they're from the ghetto to sell records. At the same time, rappers from the projects only want to be around the new rich people they meet. It makes us look negative, either way. There are so many stereotypes about black people that still live on. I don't know why that is, because it's white kids that are going around shooting each other in schools.</p>
        <p>Clark (second from left): I'm lucky because people can't tell if I'm really black, and they always ask me if I'm Puerto Rican, Dominican or Indian. Today I wanted to look Indian, because I always get more attention if people don't think I'm black. I didn't want to look too thug anyway, like I was from the projects. I want people to take me seriously. Sometimes I get mad when people ask me what I am, though. When I say I'm black, they often tell me I must be lying: ''You can't be black, because no black girl can ever look that pretty.'' It's funny, because it's black people who say that.</p>
