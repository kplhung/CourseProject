        <p>Q: You just spent the Fourth of July in Jackson Hole, right? Were there many other African-Americans out there?</p>
        <p>When I go to Jackson Hole I'm not thinking race, I'm thinking relaxation.</p>
        <p>So you don't notice if there are other black faces around?</p>
        <p>There was a young black guy playing golf who recognized me, said hello and later on the golf course I shook his hand. But Jackson Hole is not exactly representative of the American melting pot.</p>
        <p>Do you play golf on public courses or at private clubs?</p>
        <p>I belong to two clubs in Washington. And I play with my friends at their various golf clubs. I would not play at golf clubs that do not allow blacks. Obviously -- because I couldn't.</p>
        <p>Have you ever played at Augusta?</p>
        <p>It's golf heaven, period. That's all I'm going to say about that.</p>
        <p>How does someone who grew up in the first public housing project in the country, in Atlanta's University Homes, end up so passionate about a ''white'' game?</p>
        <p>I've only been playing about 10 years. When I joined the Ryder board a guy on the board sent me set of clubs and I started beating the ball around. I had been introduced to it as a young professional, but I did not have the time or the money then.</p>
        <p>Is there a difference for you between playing with a white caddy and a black caddy?</p>
        <p>A caddy is a caddy. You know, I do not run my life thinking race on a day-to-day basis. There was a time I started flying to different places when I was aware that there were no black pilots and no black flight attendants, but that all changed because there was the civil rights movement in the 1960's. As a kid I could tell you the name, the batting average, hometown, number of errors, singles, doubles, triples and home runs of all of the black baseball players. There were so few of them, and you could keep up -- but you can't do that now.</p>
        <p>When you're golfing with the president, just hanging out, do you ever talk about race?</p>
        <p>You don't spend much time on the golf course talking about race.</p>
        <p>O.K., how about when you're eating dinner with the president?</p>
        <p>It's an inevitable conversation. But our interest in race and returning back to the South after law school, which we both did, is something we have in common.</p>
        <p>If you were white, do you think such a big deal would be made of your friendship with the president?</p>
        <p>I suppose if a black person is considered the president's best pal, yeah, given the history of race in this country, it is notable and noticeable. Those pictures on the front page of The New York Times of me and Clinton in the golf cart I suspect would not have been there if some average Joe was there instead.</p>
        <p>Does being a managing director at the investment bank Lazard Fr res make you the only black partner there?</p>
        <p>I may be. I think so. But I don't walk into Lazard every day saying I'm going to be the only black fellow on my floor. I walk into Lazard every day saying I've got a job to do.</p>
        <p>If Lazard says we want Coke as a client, how would you feel working with a company that has recently had a class-action suit against it for discriminating against black employees?</p>
        <p>Every entity that you deal with has some kind of problem. So I just do my business. You deal with problems as they come up.</p>
        <p>Is Wall Street a good place for blacks, as far as equal opportunities?</p>
        <p>The street has a long way to go.</p>
        <p>You're on a lot of boards, which puts you close to the heart of corporate America. Do you ever hear racist jokes in the boardroom?</p>
        <p>I've heard over time far more inappropriate anti-Semitic comments than black comments. I think people sometimes are unmindful of the presence of others, and they think that they're</p>
        <p>still at their old club, old place, and they forget.</p>
        <p>How do you react to completely inappropriate comments?</p>
        <p>You never laugh and go along with it.</p>
        <p>Back in 1980 a white racist shot you in Fort Wayne, Ind. . . .</p>
        <p>Yes, 30-ought six. They shoot buffalo with that. I'm still standing.</p>
        <p>What sort of impact did that experience have on the way you think about race, or about racists?</p>
        <p>I have not talked about being shot, ever, and I'm not going to talk about it with you. I have only one thing to think about that, a great passage of Scripture that talks about forgetting those things that are behind and reaching forth unto those things that are before. I find anger to be a corrosive emotion. So my view on all this business about race is never to get angry, no, but to get even. You don't take it out in anger; you take it out in achievement.</p>
