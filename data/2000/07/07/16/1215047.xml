        <p>SPANISH LESSONS</p>
        <p>Beginning a New Life in Spain.</p>
        <p>By Derek Lambert.</p>
        <p>Broadway, $24.</p>
        <p>British writers have long been in the habit of fleeing southward from what they perceive as their own culture's suffocating gentility. The voyage need not be extensive; Peter Mayle found the South of France sufficiently picturesque to heal some of the wounds of civilization. The English journalist Derek Lambert has written ''Spanish Lessons'' about his attempt to settle in a small town near Alicante with his wife, Diane, and their 4-year-old son, Jonathan. The central theme is the challenge of dealing with the local population, principally gardeners and builders, who are portrayed alternately as crafty swindlers and colorful purveyors of rural charm. It is to Lambert's credit that he tries repeatedly to break down the social barrier between the village and the foreigners; on a bet, he runs with the bulls in the local version of Pamplona's festival of San Fermin, and he accepts an arm-wrestling match at the local bar. He wins the bout, but suspects that his opponent had not been trying very hard; the man admits it, saying that it had suddenly dawned on him that ''there's too much struggle in this world.'' Everyone, including the newcomers, seems to be acting according to some logical principles that have yet to be discovered.+One reason Lambert gives for moving to Spain is that once there he will be able to write a thriller about Siberia -- he has spent time in Russia while on assignment -- but, not surprisingly, he finds it difficult to imagine frozen tundra in the midst of a sunny southern landscape. Nature steps in, as if on cue, and sends the village its first blizzard in decades. Lambert's good-natured sense of irony, as he describes this culture steeped in its own magic, makes ''Spanish Lessons'' a pleasure to read.</p>
