        <p>Although the Kelme team from Spain was a wild-card choice for the Tour de France, one of three controversial selections, it showed again today that it belonged in the 20-team field.</p>
        <p>For the second time in three mountain stages, a Kelme rider won and captured the polka-dot jersey of the top-ranked climber. This time the victor was Santiago Botero, a Colombian who has been knocking on the door the last few days. He was second on a hilly stage into Revel on Tuesday and fifth up Mont Ventoux on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Botero took advantage of a seven-man breakaway halfway along in the 155-mile (249.5-kilometer) 14th stage to build an uncatchable lead once he left his companions behind on the last of three mountains in the Alps.</p>
        <p>He finished 2 minutes 30 seconds ahead in a total time of 7 hours 56 minutes 13 seconds, a speed of 19 miles an hour on a sunny, cool day with strong winds on all three climbs.</p>
        <p>Both the length of the stage and the winds were cited by Lance Armstrong, who finished seventh in a group of his leading rivals and retained his overall lead of nearly five minutes.</p>
        <p>''It was a long day, a hard day,'' Armstrong, the leader of the United States Postal Service team, said. ''Maybe too long a day. The racing wasn't aggressive. People took it easy for the first three or four hours.''</p>
        <p>After receiving another yellow jersey, Armstrong was relaxed and joking at a news conference. Asked if this had been his worst day in the first two weeks of the three-week Tour, he responded: ''Why? Did I look bad?''</p>
        <p>In fact he looked good -- launching a strong attack on the final climb and moving alone ahead of his rivals -- but isolated. Jan Ullrich, in second place over all, had a Telekom teammate to help him and Richard Virenque, now in fifth place, had a Polti teammate to help him. Both benefited from the strong pace set by those teammates.</p>
        <p>Armstrong had nobody to help him once he sped away from the last man to stay with him, Marco Pantani of the Mercatone Uno team and the winner on Mont Ventoux with Armstrong's gracious help.</p>
        <p>''We're using our riders a different way this year,'' said Dan Osipow, the Postal Service team's director of operations. ''Last year, when Lance won, we had men staying with him as long as possible on the climbs. This year we're going harder earlier.''</p>
        <p>That results in a pace so fast that it leaves behind many men in the 141-rider field. But it takes an early toll on Armstrong's support system. So far he has been strong enough to carry on single-handed.</p>
        <p>''The team is proving that they're strong, very strong,'' Armstrong said before the stage. ''Did you see the bottom of the Ventoux? There were 10 guys there and we had 3.'' Although the two others were gone quickly, they were, as he showed, unnecessary. He seems confident that the strategy will continue to work in the next two Alpine stages, Sunday and Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Armstrong praised Botero's winning ride and said the Colombian might become a rival in what the Texan has referred to as ''this three-stack we have here in the Alps.''</p>
        <p>Botero and the others in the breakaway were not chased strenuously at first because all of them ranked low in the overall standing -- Botero was highest placed at 19th over all, 13:11 behind Armstrong. Now he is eighth, 10 minutes behind.</p>
        <p>Paolo Savodelli, an Italian with Saeco and another member of the breakaway, was second in the stage, with Pantani third, 2:49 behind when the main chasing group of 11 riders made it up a steep, long ramp into Briancon, at 1,326 meters the highest city in Europe. The stage began in Draguignan and headed north.</p>
        <p>Of the mountains traversed today, the toughest was the last, the Izoard, 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) long with a grade of 7.2 percent. It was followed by a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) twisty descent into Briancon.</p>
        <p>As Virenque broke away on the descent, Armstrong decided it was payback time for Pantani, whose victory on the Ventoux he did not dispute. Seeking a pacesetter, he tapped Pantani on the back and gestured ahead. The Italian, a master descender, nodded and zipped off, quickly catching Virenque.</p>
        <p>No similar downhill will be available at the finish Sunday. After climbing the Galibier and the Madeleine peaks, both rated beyond category in toughness, the riders will face a 22-kilometer (13.7-mile) slog up to Courchevel on a grade of 6.2 percent.</p>
        <p>''I think tomorrow will be more difficult because today was long and hard,'' Armstrong said. ''On paper, it looks like a very hard day.''</p>
