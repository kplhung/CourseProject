        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jody Rosen's comments on the contemporary neglect of pre-rock pop styles are appreciated. I suspect the general preference for more ''primitive'' early records has a lot to do with rockism's obsession with ''cool.'' Good writers like Greil Marcus constantly use words like harrowing and atavistic to describe the great work of performers like Dock Boggs and Robert Johnson, and rockists flock to their records in search of some authentic mojo they can borrow. Rock-era artists who have drawn from the whole expanse of American music, like Van Dyke Parks, NRBQ and Don Byron, are often marginalized as merely eccentric, or sneered at as pretentious eclectics. The general cultural acceptance of meaningless categories ensures that not only will today's equivalents of Charles Ives be ignored, but also tomorrow's Duke Ellingtons and Brian Wilsons.</p>

        <p>It seems the only way modern listeners can permit themselves to enjoy these ''discredited'' styles is in the form of camp (Rat Pack/lounge revivalists, for example). Music can't be contained by the prejudices of sophistication snobs or three-chord reactionaries, nor can its mystic power be defined or denied by narrow ideologies. Ray Charles knew this when he interpreted Stephen Foster, and the Minutemen knew it when they adapted Steely Dan and Van Halen.</p>
