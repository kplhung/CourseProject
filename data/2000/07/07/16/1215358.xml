        <p>Making a good home video of a party isn't for the thin-skinned. I learned this the hard way last weekend in Vermont at a big backyard party given by some friends turning 40. With a borrowed camcorder, I intended to make a tape as a gift and went around asking guests to share reflections.</p>
        <p>The witty brother of one of the celebrants refused flat out and suggested I shoot his new car instead. A friend who isn't shy told me to go away, and others turned their backs. Then someone stuck his hand over the camera lens, Sean Penn-style, and I turned the thing off and got a stiff drink.  What was going on here?</p>

        <p>Making a good home video of a party isn't for the thin-skinned. I learned this the hard way last weekend in Vermont at a big backyard party given by some friends turning 40. With a borrowed camcorder, I intended to make a tape as a gift and went around asking guests to share reflections.</p>
        <p>The witty brother of one of the celebrants refused flat out and suggested I shoot his new car instead. A friend who isn't shy told me to go away, and others turned their backs. Then someone stuck his hand over the camera lens, Sean Penn-style, and I turned the thing off and got a stiff drink.  What was going on here?</p>
        <p>Robert Frost wrote, ''Something there is that doesn't love a wall.'' The same, I guess, can be said about a camera. It's hard to imagine it in this moment of pervasive reality TV and voyeuristic talk shows, with people sharing and oversharing at the least provocation. John De Mol, the creator of ''Big Brother,'' told Newsweek that if he announced a show of 10 people on an airplane with only nine parachutes, applicants would line up to risk death as long as it was televised. So why did so many of my friends resent being taped?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the distrust goes back to ''An American Family,'' the 1973 documentary on PBS that was so devastating to the Loud family. Perhaps people don't know where the tape will end up. Who, for instance, would know that those homey home videos of Elian Gonzalez would be seen on TV screens across America?</p>
        <p>Was it Diane Arbus or Frederick Wiseman, with their cool, cruel eyes, who fueled the distrust? ''When you stick your nose in the faces of some people,'' a friend who made documentaries in film school tolds me, ''they're going to want to bite it off. Not everyone's going to react well to your stealing a piece of their soul with your camera.''</p>
        <p>I know what she means. Recently, I was mortified to watch a travel photographer treat a Saint's Day procession on Sardinia as if it were a runway show. No wonder Susan Sontag has likened the shooting of a camera to the shooting of a gun.</p>
        <p>Maybe people thought I was being inauthentic -- that some experiences should be enjoyed for what they are, not captured through a lens. A friend who works at a public access TV station didn't want a video of her own wedding. ''I prefer to remember it as I experienced it,'' she said, ''not as a sequence of images captured by a camera.'' O.K., but what about eight-millimeter home movies, those lovely, silent reminders of our radiant pasts? Are they more meaningful because there's no sound?</p>
        <p>When I got home and reviewed my tape of the party, I was shocked to find myself a noisy presence, prodding each person from behind the camera. Carrying a tiki torch for lighting, I had invaded the hot tub near the orchard, which did not go over well with the group of women in it, although they did manage to say meaningful things, even while wrapped in towels. One woman trying to reminisce about our birthday boy's band at high school dances could hardly get a word in for all my interrupting.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the tape is not about a lovely party, but about me being an intrusive guest. The lesson is that you have to let your subjects take you where they want to go.  That's what real reality TV would be. And that's how good documentarians (and polite people) move about in the world.</p>
        <p>I wonder how Ricky, the video-obsessed neighbor in ''American Beauty'' who captured that plastic bag dancing in the wind so poetically, would have recorded this party. I wonder if I can have my rude voice edited out before giving the tape to my friends.</p>
        <p>''You're scripting every moment,'' one man told me as he looked into the camera. ''You have a poetic urge to dominate.'' It's a judgment that's all the more brutal because it's true. I'm not sure, though, if it makes me want to work through my intense control issues or simply work them. Maybe the only thing I've realized, having played Big Brother for a night, is that what I really want to do is what everybody else wants to do in this I-am-a-camera-crazed culture: direct.</p>
