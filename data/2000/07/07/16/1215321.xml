        <p>There may be no indoor tennis available this winter at the courts in Harbor Island Park because of continuing litigation over a new sports center to be built in the park, Steven Silverberg, the Mamaroneck village attorney, said. The Village Board of Trustees has voted unanimously to appeal a preliminary injunction barring the village from contracting to build the new center with any company other than Harbor View Racquet Club, the current operator of the courts. Harbor View's agreement with the village expired in May, and the village board had hoped to grant a contract for new courts and a multisport center to Sportime, a Long Island company. The village had argued that Harbor View, which has operated the courts since 1978, lacked the money and experience to build the center. Harbor View, however, had a right of first refusal, which Justice John P. DiBlasi of State Supreme Court in White Plains upheld last month.</p>
