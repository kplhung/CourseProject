      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial reflects on 15-part series on race in America, which concludes today in magazine section devoted to subject of race; finds racial divide persists, subtly but stubbornly, in blend of remoteness, distrust and economic inequality; confirms Martin Luther King Jr's observation that shared prosperity and caring communities are essential components of a healthy multiracial society</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Nearly a half-century ago, in his novel ''Invisible Man,'' Ralph Ellison wrote of a society in which whites and blacks rarely intersected in any meaningful way, in which black people simply did not register in the majority consciousness, except as one-dimensional stereotypes. Yet Ellison was both an optimist and an integrationist, and he might have been pleased to see, in The New York Times's six-week series on race in America, that this nation is far removed from the separatist society that he recorded in 1952.</p>
        <p>The 15th and final installment in that series is an autobiographical narrative by Don Terry, a New York Times reporter, which appears today in a Sunday magazine devoted entirely to race. The magazine uses the same journalistic technique that marked the series as a whole -- inviting whites and blacks to express their feelings about race in an uninhibited way. The results are startling -- an outpouring of hopes and grievances that add up to a sharp, contemporary picture of how whites and blacks think about one another and themselves, and of how they actually interact on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Nearly a half-century ago, in his novel ''Invisible Man,'' Ralph Ellison wrote of a society in which whites and blacks rarely intersected in any meaningful way, in which black people simply did not register in the majority consciousness, except as one-dimensional stereotypes. Yet Ellison was both an optimist and an integrationist, and he might have been pleased to see, in The New York Times's six-week series on race in America, that this nation is far removed from the separatist society that he recorded in 1952.</p>
        <p>The 15th and final installment in that series is an autobiographical narrative by Don Terry, a New York Times reporter, which appears today in a Sunday magazine devoted entirely to race. The magazine uses the same journalistic technique that marked the series as a whole -- inviting whites and blacks to express their feelings about race in an uninhibited way. The results are startling -- an outpouring of hopes and grievances that add up to a sharp, contemporary picture of how whites and blacks think about one another and themselves, and of how they actually interact on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>These conversations would not have been possible, however, if America had not advanced to a point where blacks and whites, unlike the races in Ellison's day, could share the same spaces and many of the same dreams and aspirations. America is now an inescapably multiracial society in many of its schools, workplaces, churches, cultural institutions and its military. In some articles in the series, blacks and whites did not interact much at all, living essentially parallel lives -- the white quarterback at the predominantly black university, for example, or the two Cubans in Miami, thrust into separate orbits by a racially divided city.</p>
        <p>But most of the pieces are rich with shared activity -- in the public schools of Maplewood, N.J., in the Akron Beacon Journal newsroom, on the set of an HBO series, in a tank battalion at Fort Knox, at the Assembly of God Tabernacle in Atlanta. As a New York Times poll on race suggested last week, these are not isolated instances of social interaction. Though most Americans still do not live or worship with those of other races, 76 percent of whites and 84 percent of blacks said they had close friends of another race, and equally surprising numbers -- 43 percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks -- said people of a different race had visited their homes socially in the last month.</p>
        <p>The poll also confirmed dispiriting aspects of the Times series. Although whites seem more sensitive today to the realities of black life than they were in Ellison's time, the two races seem to be living on different planets on issues like fairness and equal opportunity. By an overwhelming margin, for instance, blacks said they were treated unfairly by the police, as opposed to only one in four whites who thought blacks were treated unfairly.  Four of 10 blacks thought they had the same economic opportunities as whites, whereas 6 in 10 whites thought the playing field was now level.</p>
        <p>Unlike whites, blacks live with the consequences of America's history of discrimination every day, which may help explain why they seemed far more willing than whites to share their thoughts with Times reporters. While many whites expressed fatigue with racial issues, blacks like Charles Dutton, the angry director in the story about the HBO series, seemed eager to discuss their feelings with a liberating bluntness.</p>
        <p>Last week, President Clinton and both major presidential candidates, George W. Bush and Al Gore, made pilgrimages to the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual meeting. Their appearances were a reminder that this country's next leap forward in race relations must build upon but also reach beyond the issues that moved America in the 1960's, when bigotry was more nakedly expressed and civil rights advocates of both races could focus their united energies on the legal barriers to political and educational equality.</p>
        <p>Today's racial divide is more subtle, but it remains a stubbornly persistent blend of remoteness, distrust and economic inequality. Trust, perhaps, cannot be mandated. But as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. observed decades ago, shared prosperity and caring communities are essential components of a healthy multiracial society. One of the lessons of The Times's series is that this message is as relevant at the start of the new American century as it was in the early days of the civil rights revolution.</p>
