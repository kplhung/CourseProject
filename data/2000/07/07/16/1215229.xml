        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a musical culture so obsessed with youth, Jody Rosen makes a refreshingly nonfashionable point by suggesting that old school artists might be best equipped to wrestle with the Groovebox, in order to create sounds and styles even more exciting and potent than their original inventions [''90's Hipsters Dial Up the Past With an 80's Plaything,'' June 18]. However, as the musician who turned Afrika Bambaataa's genius vision into sound on ''Planet Rock'' and many of his other early recordings, I can assure you that machines alone do not create magic.</p>

        <p>In a musical culture so obsessed with youth, Jody Rosen makes a refreshingly nonfashionable point by suggesting that old school artists might be best equipped to wrestle with the Groovebox, in order to create sounds and styles even more exciting and potent than their original inventions [''90's Hipsters Dial Up the Past With an 80's Plaything,'' June 18]. However, as the musician who turned Afrika Bambaataa's genius vision into sound on ''Planet Rock'' and many of his other early recordings, I can assure you that machines alone do not create magic.</p>
        <p>The term programming used in relationship to the playing of synthesizers meant something very different back in the day. It referred to the musicians' ability to create and shape their own special signature sounds from instruments without boundaries or preset digital sounds. What made the early electro records great was the fact that most of these original programmers were not only great synthesists, they were also accomplished session keyboardists with skills in arrangement and composition. This meeting of music school, the street and technology created the incredible convergence of style essential to the production of great electro funk. As a wise old funk master once said, it's in the mix.</p>
