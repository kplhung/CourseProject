        <p>NOW for the bad news: good news is on vacation. Permanently.</p>
        <p>In the news media, anyway, ''no news is good news'' just might be read as ''there is no such thing as good news,'' something local television has been trying to convince viewers of for years. That goes double for news photography: the news photographs you remember are likely to compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the streets of Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.</p>

        <p>NOW for the bad news: good news is on vacation. Permanently.</p>
        <p>In the news media, anyway, ''no news is good news'' just might be read as ''there is no such thing as good news,'' something local television has been trying to convince viewers of for years. That goes double for news photography: the news photographs you remember are likely to compose a litany of grief and terror, from the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald to the execution of a Vietcong prisoner on the streets of Saigon to the dragging of a dead American soldier's body through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia.</p>
        <p>Pictures of those three events won Pulitzer Prizes. A show called ''The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment,'' at the Newseum/NY in midtown Manhattan through Sept. 23, reinforces the widespread impression that news tends to be violent and morbid. Smiles, joy, tenderness and near misses exist in the Pulitzer world, and fine extended captions relate that some of the rescue attempts recorded here were successful, but most of the more than 100 pictures are almost equally endowed with visual distinction and despair. Plummeting bodies, starving children and dead men in the dust tend to crowd out the reassuring images of soldiers reunited with their families and policemen being nice to little boys.</p>
        <p>The Pulitzer Prizes were established by Joseph Pulitzer, the newspaper magnate, early in this century, with a bequest of $2 million to Columbia University to set up a school of journalism and prizes for journalism, letters, music, drama and education as well as traveling scholarships. (The university's president was at first reluctant, fearing that a journalism school would diminish its intellectual reputation.) The first prizes were given in 1917. In 1942, photography was added to the list, quite appropriately, for photographs had already taken over the news. Tabloids and picture magazines had made photographs not only central but in effect essential. On March 1, 1920, for example, The New York Times had no photographs at all, but on an average day in 1938, The Times published a picture on almost every news page. The Pulitzer Prize board created a separate category for feature photographs in 1968, after faster film and new small cameras like the Nikon had changed the photographic territory.</p>
        <p>''Capture the Moment,'' the largest collection of Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs ever shown in this country, includes pictures for every year from 1942 to 1999 except for 1946, when the judges thought no entry worth a prize. (The exhibition moves to the Newseum in Arlington, Va., in the fall. A catalog is available on the Web at www.newseum.org.) Curiously, the first large survey of this distinctly American award was recently put on in Japan by and for the Japanese, who have won Pulitzers a couple of times. (Pulitzer submissions must have appeared in an American newspaper but need not be by American citizens.)</p>
        <p>The first Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph was a picture of a group of strikers beating a man; the 1999 photographs recorded the carnage of the embassy bombing in Nairobi and several stages in the Monica Lewinsky affair: from violence to violence, with a stop at sex and shame. The common cant is that news (and games and films and music and so on) have become more violent, which may well be true, but it is a mistake to think the news was once a teddy bear that turned into a grizzly when other media came along.</p>
        <p>Newspapers have included some measure of violence ever since they stopped being commercial reports or political party organs in the 1830's and began to sell for as little as a penny, appeal to a broader audience and redefine news as accounts of large and small events all over the world. Penny papers carried entire transcripts of murder trials, something the old-fashioned kind of paper claimed to find shocking. By the 1840's, engraved illustrations changed the look of the news, and numerous papers found that pictures of accused murderers, not to mention engravers' reconstructions of actual killings, infallibly improved circulation figures.</p>
        <p>Yet the great bulk of visual news was and remains pretty tame, relatively inert and unthreatening. It might be an image of rival politicians pretending to respect each other, or the publicity photograph of someone who was alive enough to pose for it until he died of a heart attack last night, or perhaps a picture of football players imitating pile drivers in a championship maneuver. Images like these do not bore holes in the memory. The pictures that do, though fewer, crowd out the rest by the size of the reaction they create. Tragedy and violence get our attention, partly because they are so fearsome, partly because they are, outside of a war zone, relatively unusual. Dog bites man isn't news because it's all too ordinary. Murder, on the other hand, is no more of an everyday occurrence for most people than man bites dog.</p>
        <p>Relative rarity is obviously not the whole story. The pictures of the kinds of events that have dominated the Pulitzers -- a Japanese about to run a sword through a politician; a plane crashed and burning in a suburban yard; a wounded soldier clinging desperately to a priest in the midst of gunfire; a young woman screaming over a dead student at Kent State -- are uncommon in many ways. They are uncommonly well observed, which does not necessarily mean artistic or aesthetic. They do indeed capture a moment, a drama, at some hideous and telling peak, stopping time so precipitously that the mind involuntarily braces for what is implied and what must come next -- the sword in the flesh, the crumpled bodies hidden now by smoke.</p>
        <p>And danger, suffering and death magnetize the eyes for reasons that are embedded in the nature of human existence. Pain and suffering are hardly rare and death is ultimately ubiquitous, no matter how uncommon it may be to meet it at the end of a sword. All of us expend huge amounts of (mostly unconscious) energy avoiding even thinking about pain or death, particularly our own, but pictures are just removed enough and the people in them unknown and unknowable enough to make looking at them seem temporarily safer than dwelling on ourselves.</p>
        <p>DEATH is probably the ultimate fascination: what is it? what happens when it arrives? what does it look like? how will it come to me and how will I face it? Not that way, the news picture whispers; not at that extreme. And if that plane crashed, doesn't that mean that mine has a better chance of arriving safely? Although pictures of suffering, torture, starvation, death inflicted on the innocent can make us judge humankind harshly and diminish our self-respect in the process, to some small degree they might also be reassuring: not me, not this time, not ever.</p>
        <p>Photographs of extreme situations frequently carry with them an aura of derring-do, of danger and unbearable emotion outside the fierce events they picture. How did the photographer get that picture? Why did fate arrange for someone to be there at that precise and hazardous instant? It goes without saying that war photographers were under fire at the moment they clicked the shutter, heroically or foolishly but certainly professionally recording history, or at least garnering information. Many have died in pursuit of that goal, and the death rate is increasing as military, rebel and terrorist groups put journalists onto their hit lists. Other kinds of dangers also attend the job. Photographers chronicling refugees and starvation must have to overcome the normal reactions of horror and pity in order simply to make the pictures.</p>
        <p>Some burn out. In 1993, Kevin Carter, a South African photojournalist, took a grim picture of a Sudanese child trying to crawl to a feeding center while a vulture sat nearby. He chased the bird away after taking the picture, and then he cried. After the photograph was published, people reacted with outrage: why hadn't he picked the child up? In fact, journalists had been expressly instructed not to touch famine victims because of the risk of disease. Nonetheless, Carter was torn by regrets. Doubtless he had other troubles as well. He died in 1994 at the age of 33, an apparent suicide -- three months after he won the Pulitzer.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the attractions of violent (or malevolent) imagery were neither discovered nor invented by the camera or by other modern media. Long before photography, hangings and beheadings were memorialized in inexpensive woodcuts that were snapped up by the droves of people who came out for the occasions or were unfortunate enough to miss the main events. Well into the 19th century, executions were holidays in many countries, and schools were let out so that children could witness them. It was generally believed that witnessing the rewards of sin would deter the witnesses from following the same road, and that the sinner's repentance would be particularly instructive.</p>
        <p>Public executions went private as governments realized that the excitement they occasioned would not only fail to improve crime statistics but could even incite disturbances. The moral value of witnessing is still the main rationale for photographs of all kinds of calamities, despite the intrusion of sensationalism into the mix (or its continued presence). The first principle is that the public needs to know, the second is the lingering belief that a public aware of injustice will do something to correct it. The kinds of horrifying news pictures that are sometimes called immoral and charged with pandering to our baser instincts and provoking copy-cat behavior may have begun in idealism and a photographer's yearning for a righteous place to stand.</p>
        <p>An actual place to stand, a location, is as important in photojournalism as it is in real estate; no amount of talent will suffice if the photographer is not where the action is. In the early years of the Pulitzer Prizes, in 1947 and 1954, two amateurs won the awards. The first was a college student who grabbed his camera when he heard fire trucks and snapped a woman plunging through the air as she jumped to escape the flames. The second amateur was a woman who was behind a truck when the truck's steering went out of control and sent its cab dangling perilously over the edge of a bridge. As her husband went to the rescue, she took a picture of one of the two truck drivers being pulled to safety on a rope, and won a Pulitzer. (The other driver made it, too, seconds before the cab burst into flames and plunged to the rocks 70 feet below.)</p>
        <p>The fact that amateurs could beat out the pros says something about the nature of news, the omnipresence of cameras and the democratizing nature of consumer technology. Years ago, inexpensive and easy-to-operate cameras made almost everyone a potential recorder of the news. The video camera did it again, and the Internet is democratizing the means of distribution. Tiny cameras are currently threatening to be everywhere, in computers and Palm Pilots and cell phones. The next time a man bites a dog, someone will probably record it.</p>
        <p>That's the good news. It might be hard to find more.</p>
