        <p>CHRISTOPHER H. GIBBS begins his brief new book on Schubert (''The Life of Schubert,'' Cambridge University Press) by avoiding any claim to the ''true'' man and composer. He will, in his words, ''recount what can be reliably documented and . . . examine some of the most persistent legends.''</p>
        <p>Here is a little more from the same paragraph: ''constructing a narrative of Schubert's life . . . necessarily reflects contemporaneous interpretations, concerns and methods, and constitutes Schubert's subjectivity according to contemporaneous theories, paradigms and cultural context.''</p>
        <p>The academese is tortured, but the words are wise. Let's put aside ''paradigm'' and ''context'' and be simpler. First, facts are only part of the truth. Knowing the chronologies and the anecdotes from friends is a help, but they do not tell us who Schubert was. Indeed, the truth of Schubert is that he knows more about us than we about him.</p>
        <p>Some creative people are this big. Each generation re-examines Beethoven and Shakespeare, and finds itself looking in a mirror. The fact of Beethoven is the small, ugly blue-chinned man staring out of the Viennese portraiture of 1803 and 1804. In Max Klinger's ''Beethoven Monument,'' carved a century later, the composer has taken on the physique of a running back, outfitted in a weirdly luxurious array of marble. Forensic investigators measuring the bones buried in the great man's grave would be hard put to match them up with Klinger's Olympian figure, bent forward with fists clenched.</p>
        <p>The song goes, ''You made me what I am today; I hope you're satisfied.'' And so we listened to the music for 100 years and needed to make the man bigger. The most rewarding conceit in Mr. Gibbs's book is that Schubert's body died in 1828 but that his musical career kept growing. The same can be said for Beethoven, although Schubert's case is more vivid.</p>
        <p>With Beethoven, there were fewer things to discover. Schubert masterpieces kept emerging from attic trunks 40 and 50 years after the composer's death. Great piles of his songs and instrumental pieces were around but either forgotten or ignored. The ''Unfinished'' Symphony had its first performance at least 40 years after it was written; similarly, the ''Great C major'' Symphony. Well into the 20th century, only Artur Schnabel and a few others played the piano sonatas. Rachmaninoff in the mid-20's did not know they existed.</p>
        <p>Already a decade after Schubert's death, the trickle of his music made one French writer wonder if forgers were at work: ''All Paris has been in a state of amazement at the posthumous diligence of the songwriter Franz Schubert, who, while one would think his ashes repose in peace in Vienna, is still making eternal new songs and putting drawing rooms in commotion.'' Later, the critic Eduard Hanslick accused Schubert's corpse of ''composing invisibly.''</p>
        <p>It was a career in the form of a time-release capsule. Each new granule that enters our system has an added effect on it. And as we listen anew, we reformulate Schubert the man. In the operetta ''Blossom Time,'' Schubert played the sappy dreamer; the imaginary smell of lilies coming off the stage was overpowering.</p>
        <p>A docudrama shown at Lincoln Center a few years ago was a stunning evocation of place. One could almost smell the horses, the streets and, indeed, Schubert himself. The film itself was a homage not so much to the composer as to the sadomasochistic tendencies of the Central European spirit, being divided rather simple-mindedly into innocent victim (Schubert) and oppressors (his circle of friends). One scene went roughly like this. Friends: ''Schubert, you must compose operas.'' Schubert: ''But gee, fellas, all I want to do is write the C major Quintet.'' Friends: ''No, Schubert, you must compose operas.'' Schubert: ''Oh, all right.''</p>
        <p>For modern musicologists, battered by sexual revolutions and psychotherapy, Schubert is a drunk and probably gay. The Romantic era concluded from the anecdotes of friends that he was neglected and poverty-stricken (although Mr. Gibbs points out that he wasn't really either).</p>
        <p>Beethoven and Schubert represented two forms of the Romantic dream. Beethoven became the fierce giant on the mountaintop, shaking his fist at Valhalla. As the heroism of his music got bigger, it was necessary to make bodily adjustments as well. Schubert could be wept over deliciously. He was the tragic loser: unappreciated and snatched from life at 31. We liked him small, roly-poly, vulnerable and not at all vast or otherworldly.</p>
        <p>INDEED, the title ''Unfinished,'' as Mr. Gibbs points out, became a Schubertian metaphor for a life we wanted to imagine. We like to sigh that death robbed us of the famous symphony's last two movements, when in fact Schubert most certainly wrote what we know years earlier and then put it aside for a later day. It also spoils our fun to consider the possibility that Schubert simply lived faster than the rest of us, with knowledge of bad health accelerating the creative footrace of that astonishing last year.</p>
        <p>Next to Beethoven's machismo, Schubert shows his feminine side only if we accept politically incorrect characteristics of womanhood: namely, passivity, a yielding nature and victimization. Recent attempts at parsing the harmony and phrasing for womanly traits have resulted in unintended humor.</p>
        <p>In the end, Mr. Gibbs is right. We can put on Schubert's clothes, taste his food and drink, and still not understand his world. Constructing the fact of his daily life produces a kind of Colonial Williamsburg, a place that has more to do with tourists than with the House of Burgesses. Schubert will always be what we want him to be. Again, he's that big.</p>
