        <p>MUSIC spills out of the gaping front windows of the Downtown Cafe, nestled between a hardware store and an electronics shop on West Front Street. A young waitress, planted on the sidewalk, sways her hips and smiles, snake-charming passers-by to embark on an eclectic journey beyond the cheery 1800's-style facade.</p>
        <p>Wind through the candle-lit, exposed-brick dining room and ample bar, past the small kitchen serving up seafood and Italian fare to reach the retro-chic sushi bar, a small bright hideaway, complete with colorful fans and hanging paper dragons. Travel upstairs to enter a dark, trendy lair of pulsating music, provided by either a local disc jockey or band of any imaginable uber-contemporary genre. Land a stool anywhere in the joint and sip one of 24 memorable martinis, from a ''Super Dag Daddy'' to a frothy ''Banana Tini.''</p>

        <p>MUSIC spills out of the gaping front windows of the Downtown Cafe, nestled between a hardware store and an electronics shop on West Front Street. A young waitress, planted on the sidewalk, sways her hips and smiles, snake-charming passers-by to embark on an eclectic journey beyond the cheery 1800's-style facade.</p>
        <p>Wind through the candle-lit, exposed-brick dining room and ample bar, past the small kitchen serving up seafood and Italian fare to reach the retro-chic sushi bar, a small bright hideaway, complete with colorful fans and hanging paper dragons. Travel upstairs to enter a dark, trendy lair of pulsating music, provided by either a local disc jockey or band of any imaginable uber-contemporary genre. Land a stool anywhere in the joint and sip one of 24 memorable martinis, from a ''Super Dag Daddy'' to a frothy ''Banana Tini.''</p>
        <p>From top to bottom, you'll feel as if you're anywhere but in the middle of this quaint riverbank town.</p>
        <p>''We like to try to have a couple of different vibes in one place,'' said Jim Davies, a co-owner who prefers to be called Red Eye. ''The upstairs and downstairs here are very different. We're not a beachy bar, we're more of a city-, Manhattan-style bar.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Patrick Nulle, a former real estate developer and once the youngest mayor of Barnegat, bought the Jolly Trolley, a local pub with a long railroad layout, low ceilings and ''boots everywhere.'' He has completely remodeled the place, raising the ceiling downstairs and expanding the venue upwards. Next year, he plans to offer a glassed-in deck out back, to enjoy the view of the river and ''Tar Beach,'' his roof, which he claims inspired Bruce Springsteen's song of the same name after a private party with the local celebrity.</p>
        <p>''I spent a lot of time in Manhattan a few years ago, and I asked my real estate broker to find me a SoHo-style place,'' said Mr. Nulle. ''After five minutes in this place, I wrote a check.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nulle, a leather-faced figure clad all in black, like his staff, spends his evenings, drink in hand, mingling with his employees and patrons, many of whom he knows by name, giving the place its ''Cheers'' feel, as described by some customers.</p>
        <p>''We get 50 job applications a week,'' Mr. Nulle said. Pointing to the hip crowd he personally assembled behind his bar, dancing as they take drink orders, he adds, ''I don't care about experience, I care about the 'look,' meaning a certain style and attitude.''</p>
        <p>Matching the interest of prospective employees are the local bands clamoring to play here. Daniel Gibson, the booking agent, said he receives about 10 calls a day from interested musicians, despite the small venue. ''We started with an emphasis on blues and jazz and now we're offering swing, funk and hip-hop, too,'' he said. ''We're not a cheesy cover-band place, which is unusual for the Jersey shore. I want creativity to happen here.''</p>
        <p>From Monday through Sunday, the Downtown Cafe crams in a variety of entertainment. The week begins with a sort of ''Salon Appreciation Night,'' a marketing ploy catering to the abundant local salon professionals that ensures a packed house. Hair stylists can dance to old disco and enjoy cheaper food and drink. Downstairs, Pat Guadagno, a local singer and songwriter, performs every Monday.</p>
        <p>Bill Nuzzo, a local furniture businessman who frequents the place with his wife, said: ''This is probably the best Monday night anywhere in the state. For a bar to be packed every Monday night, that's pretty unusual.''</p>
        <p>Other regular weekly features include Tuesday night jazz downstairs and live surf rock upstairs; hip-hop on Wednesday nights; rhythm and blues on Thursday nights and an open-mike session downstairs, or D.J. mixes upstairs on Sundays. On the weekend, the entertainment could be anything from swing to Brazilian rock.</p>
        <p>''We like to keep it upbeat here -- you're not going to hear any classical music or heavy metal,'' said Red Eye, a young surfer and elementary-school teacher who abandoned the classroom for nights behind the bar. His red ponytail swings across his black velvet shirt as he turns to grab a different bottle to complete his concoction. ''I want to have things here that you won't have at every other bar.''</p>
        <p>On a recent Friday night, there are fewer choices to make, with only one live music act: Brown, a local funk band that draws an age-diverse, local Jersey shore crowd upstairs, making conversation difficult and keeping the bartenders (Britney Spears- and Back Street Boys-lookalikes) busy.</p>
        <p>The local spin maestro D.J. Prestige imprisons himself in the small iron bar cage meant for dancers, awaiting a break in the set to spin some more classic funk. The deep red walls and ceiling grow black as the night unfolds.</p>
        <p>''This is the best place in town,'' said D.J. Prestige (Jamison Harvey, when he's not in front of a turntable). ''It's not a college-frat-beer-throw-down. It's unlike any other place in the area.''</p>
        <p>The different bands bring in different crowds, and the experience varies depending on which floor you are on, according to Heather Deyo and her sister Michelle Leist.</p>
        <p>''I come here for the Godiva martinis about twice a month when I'm visiting my sister,'' Ms. Deyo said. ''I like the atmosphere; it's very chic, unlike anything in Little Egg Harbor.'' They prefer to be upstairs, amid lava lamps and trendy black leather couches.</p>
        <p>''Up here, you feel like you're in a lounge,'' Ms. Leist said. ''You kind of forget that you're in Red Bank.''</p>
