        <p>Derryck (left): Sean and I were playing. He didn't want to wrestle anymore, because he thought I was going to punch him in the stomach, but I wasn't going to punch him in the stomach. Black and white kids can be friends with each other, if you're in the same class. But they can't get married, because they don't match. They can't have a kid together. But they can be boyfriend and girlfriend. Like, my friend James likes Lauren. He's black and she's white.</p>
        <p>Sean (right): People are black and white because God chose them that way, because he just wanted to. I don't know why. Yes, black and white people can get married. If they have a kid, it could be either black or white. Someone in my class said James wanted to marry Lauren. But I like Bianca, because her drawings are pretty.</p>
