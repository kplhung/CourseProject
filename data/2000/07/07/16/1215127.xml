        <p>Charles Cooper Barefield and Olga Rodriguez,  Newport News, Va.</p>
        <p>Barefield (left): I got a heart transplant in 1999. I wanted to write the donor family, but I did not want to open old wounds. Then I got a letter from Olga, the donor's daughter. She wanted to meet. That day, I walked over, handed her flowers and held out my arms. She gave me a great big hug and next thing I knew, she was crying. She just kind of slid down and said, ''I want to listen to my dad's heartbeat.'' I was just holding her, comforting her. It felt natural. It was rather teary for me as well. He died and I lived. Every day I pray for him. I told one of her brothers that we should plan an extended family reunion. I was surprised that Olga's father was Latino. It doesn't matter, but you don't normally think about that. Now I sign my name as Carlos Cooper Barefield instead of Charles.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez (right): I had this desire to hold Charles's hand, but I did not want to scare the guy. My dad wouldn't like me saying this, but we Hispanic people, we show our emotions, but American people, they like to plan everything. Even in love, they're that way. But when Charles held my hand, my dad's spirit embraced me. My dad was from the Dominican Republic, and he died waiting for his citizenship. Every time he talked about this country, his eyes got watery. When he died, I put a little American flag in his hand with a rosary. I don't have words to describe the emptiness that he left. But just knowing that his heart is beating, part of him is alive out there -- it's mystical, no question about it.</p>
