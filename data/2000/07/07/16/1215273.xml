        <p>In a broad demographic profile that anticipates the findings of the 2000 census, researchers from Rutgers University have portrayed the New Jersey that everyone suspected was out there: an aging, affluent population sustained by immigration, employed at record levels and creating a new exurban landscape.

        <p>In a broad demographic profile that anticipates the findings of the 2000 census, researchers from Rutgers University have portrayed the New Jersey that everyone suspected was out there: an aging, affluent population sustained by immigration, employed at record levels and creating a new exurban landscape. In this picture, the state's population is moving ever outward, and while its cities are finally stanching losses, they have been overtaken by burgeoning, sprawling suburban townships like Woodbridge and Edison. And these are populated largely by baby boomers who are entering peak earning years and ''producing an era of demographically driven affluence.''</p>
        <p>But the report, made public today, says that while New Jersey may feel more congested than ever -- and it is -- the census will find that the state is growing only half as fast as the rest of the nation.</p>
        <p>In sum, the census will confirm that ''New Jersey survived the economic trauma of the early 1990's,'' James W. Hughes, the report's main author, said in an interview. ''It's a confirmation of a vibrant diversity, because of all that immigration, a thriving economy, and always a maturing baby boom generation lurking beneath everything.''</p>
        <p>The report was meant to ''set the stage so people are aware of the trends and can evaluate the raw numbers that are going to be spewed out over time,'' said Mr. Hughes, who is the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. He prepared the report with Joseph J. Seneca, an economist at the university, and Connie O. Hughes, an assistant commissioner of the state labor department.</p>
        <p>''There is a hunger for information on Census 2000,'' Mr. Hughes said, ''and we're on a diet until late 2001.''</p>
        <p>The report calls New Jersey a ''population laggard.'' Using the most recent census estimates and data on long-term trends, the researchers projected that the census would find a population increase of 5.8 percent for New Jersey and a 10.4 percent increase for the nation.</p>
        <p>But the report says the state has been ''a growth dynamo in its own region,'' with a 5.3 percent population gain through 1999, compared with 1.1 percent in New York and 0.9 percent in Pennsylvania. Connecticut lost 0.2 percent of its population during the decade.</p>
        <p>Thus the nation's most suburban and most densely populated state became more so. Still, for the third consecutive decade, New Jerseyans left in sizable numbers. The net loss to other states was 378,495, according to Census Bureau estimates as of the end of December, while the state gained 377,830 immigrants.</p>
        <p>And those immigrants have changed the state's racial and ethnic composition, the report says. In a reflection of nationwide trends, New Jersey is a little more African-American than it was in 1990 (15.2 percent of the population, up from 13.9 percent) and considerably more Hispanic (12.8 percent, up from 9.7 percent) and Asian (5.8 percent, up from 3.6 percent).</p>
        <p>''In 2000 New Jersey will be somewhat more diverse than the nation as a whole -- but not dramatically so,'' the researchers wrote.</p>
        <p>They said this year's racial and ethnic data are hard to anticipate, because the census allowed people for the first time to check more than one racial classification. When results are anaylzed, Mr. Hughes said, ''we'll have a good feeling for what our communities are in this high-immigration era.''</p>
        <p>The report says the census should also document a continuation of the relentless suburbanization that Mr. Hughes, an urban planner who began his career as a specialist in housing trends, has detailed over several decades.</p>
        <p>The waves from New York and Philadelphia spread ever farther, the report says, with two decades of suburban office construction along freeway corridors. The six counties in the state's midsection (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris and Somerset) led the growth. ''It is here that the new information-age economy positioned itself, and where maturing baby boom housing choices are oriented,'' the researchers wrote.</p>
        <p>In their share of the state's population, these ''wealth belt'' counties should approach parity with the ''mature core metropolis'' (Essex, Bergen, Hudson, Passaic and Union counties) in the 2000 census, the report says, and should surpass it soon after.</p>
        <p>The older cities lost population overall in the 1990's, but at a slower pace than they had in the previous four decades. The researchers said that in the next decade the ''big six'' cities (Camden, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Newark, Paterson and Trenton) as a group might register their first increase since the 1940's.</p>
        <p>The interim census figures made public last year showed tiny population increases from 1990 to 1998 in Jersey City and Elizabeth. And in all the big six except Camden, investment has risen sharply in the last few years. According to state figures made public this month, spending on building rehabilitation in the five biggest cities was almost twice as high last year as it was in 1996, with only Newark suffering a decline from 1998.</p>
        <p>While urban centers struggled through the decade to reverse losses, the townships identifed in the Rutgers report as the ''big six suburbs'' (Brick, Dover, Woodbridge, Edison, Hamilton and Cherry Hill) kept growing. Four of them -- Brick, Dover, Woodbridge and Edison -- had already surpassed both Camden and Trenton in the 1998 census estimates.</p>
        <p>And New Jersey is still rich -- ''an extraordinary consumer market,'' the report says -- and will likely rank only behind Connecticut in income.</p>
        <p>But the rest of the nation is catching up, apparently: the report projects that the census will find New Jersey's median household income 31 percent higher than the national median, while in 1990 it was 36 percent higher. (In 1980, the state's advantage was only 18 percent.)</p>
        <p>The gap shrank in the early 1990's, when the recession took an especially high toll in New Jersey, and then widened again with the economic expansion in the second half of the decade.</p>
        <p>And New Jerseyans are employed as never before. The report said Census 2000 should find record low unemployment rates -- the natural result of a surging economy and a modest increase in the work force. While the state's population grew 5.3 percent, the number of 20 to 34 year olds declined as the baby bust generation came of working age, and the labor force grew just 3.5 percent.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the baby boomers were swelling the ranks of middle-aged, which the report says is ''the most powerful age-structure shift that will be revealed by Census 2000.'' Almost one in three New Jerseyans is a boomer, now 36 to 54 years old.</p>
        <p>''Never before in history,'' the researchers wrote, ''has America and New Jersey had such a coincidence and concentration of its population in the stage of the life cycle when individual economic productivity and income peak.''</p>
        <p>The data on household makeup will show fewer married couples with children under 18, the report says: in a pattern of drastic change from the era when the boomers' parents were suburbanizing, only one-quarter of households consist of a married couple with children under 18, while about the same percentage is single people living alone.</p>
        <p>In a centurylong perspective, the researchers noted that after explosive population increases in the pre-Depression decades and the postwar boom, growth slowed drastically, to a rate of 2.7 percent in the 1970's. It rose to 5 percent in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The report, ''Anticipating Census 2000: New Jersey's Emerging Demographic Profile,'' is the 18th in a series tracking demographic changes in the state and region.</p>
