        <p>Gladys West and Betsy Harper, Grifton, N.C.</p>
        <p>West (left): I like to visit Ms. Harper every week. I've known her my whole life, but we've just only become friends seven years ago. We had no connection to each other growing up, because I couldn't talk to whites unless I worked for them, and I never worked for Ms. Harper. I'd see her on the street in Grifton, though. She was the best-looking white woman I ever saw, better looking than any movie star. She was built nice and had large blue eyes. I never wanted to look like her, though, because when I looked in the mirror I knew I was something myself, well built, with long hair. I knew I was just as good as her, even if no one else thought so. I thought we could be friends one day, because she was just so calm-looking, never stuck up. Many years later, I bought oil from her husband, who was an oilman. I heard he liked collards, so I made some for him. That's when I first started visiting them. Ms. Harper invited me right in and we found out we had a lot in common. Now we get together and talk about recipes, and I've told her how to make collards and molasses pudding. I have other white friends, too, and you know what? I never worked for any of them. I'd like to think that racism in Grifton is a thing of the past, but it isn't. It will never go away. And it's not just in whites. There's hate on both sides. Young black kids grow up here now and hear how we weren't allowed to mix with whites when I was growing up, and they'll get so angry and let the devil in. Me, I don't look at the news, because I don't want to see anything that will get me mad at whites. I just try to get closer to God and visit people like Ms. Harper and be nice to them and hope they will be nice back to me.</p>
        <p>Harper (right): Today Gladys came by, unannounced. She often just stops by. We just sit around like two friends, talking about flowers and food. That I'm white and she's black doesn't play a factor in our relationship. Except when we go to church. She stays with her congregation, and I stay with mine. I've always made a special effort to treat black people like people. I think it's because Grifton was so small when I was growing up. The population was only 500. So my daddy taught me that if we treated the black people as if they were like us, there would be no trouble. Even though blacks and whites are supposed to get along better now, I feel there's more tension because there are now 2,500 people living here. Everybody can't know everybody else anymore.</p>
