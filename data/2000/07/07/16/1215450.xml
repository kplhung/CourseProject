        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Doctors Who Love Publicity'' (July 2), there is the implication that doctors who seek publicity are not excellent physicians. Seeking publicity is not inherently evil or immoral and has nothing to do with whether a physician is an excellent diagnostician, therapist or compassionate human being. As director of dermatopathology (skin pathology) at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, my job is to diagnose skin specimens, thereby helping dermatologists such as Dr. David Bank correctly treat their patient.</p>

        <p>Since I am consistently interacting with dermatologists regarding clinical-pathologic correlation, I am in a unique position to evaluate at least one aspect of the quality of care that a dermatologist gives to his or her patients. It has been my impression over a 15-year period that Dr. David Bank is an excellent dermatologist regardless of whether he ''seeks publicity.''</p>
