        <p>Yatil Green wears a simple stretchy wrap on his right knee, a series of scars hidden beneath with nothing in his gait to betray his extraordinary history of injury and the star-crossed career he is attempting to restart with the Jets. Seven times his right knee has been sliced open, three times doctors have operated on the left.</p>
        <p>In the last three years alone, he has had seven operations.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Green was drafted 15th over all by the Miami Dolphins, but that was four seasons -- and two devastating knee injuries -- ago. Now entering his fourth season in the National Football League, after playing just eight games as a pro, Green has caught 18 passes for 234 yards, only twice the number of receptions he hauled in during just one game at the University of Miami. But that was when Green could consistently run the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds without even stretching, years before he would run 4.41 in a tryout for the Jets -- fast enough for them to take a chance on Green, but not fast enough for Green.</p>
        <p>''I was upset with that,'' he said. ''Because that was the first time I ran 4.4. Times have changed.''</p>
        <p>Painfully so. Green did not play a down in his first two years as a pro, his seasons aborted when he blew out his right knee in each of his first two training camps. Green recounts those injuries matter-of-factly, without a trace of melancholy, like a witness telling the police about the car accident he just saw.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't touched at all,'' Green said. ''The first year, I was running on a deep route, the ball was underthrown, I plant to come back for it, it ripped. I knew right then it was gone.</p>
        <p>''The second time, it was an end cut. I felt the pop, but I finished the cut, caught the ball, burst up the field. I worked out after practice. Went home that evening, called my best friend. I said, 'Something is not right, I'm not feeling good.' I went in the next morning, they said, 'Yatil, it's gone.' I was like, 'Why me?' ''</p>
        <p>His body torn, his confidence shaken, Green turned to reminders of his glory days. After his second knee injury, he watched game film of his days as a Miami Hurricane, when he had 82 receptions for 1,397 yards and 9 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''I was questioning my abilities,'' Green said. ''I was a little nervous going out there. I went back and looked at the film and saw that I could make plays. Considering all I've been through, I feel fine. The knee is going to be tender at times. I have to work through it. I've missed enough games. I know I've done everything I could to put myself in position to be on the field.''</p>
        <p>The Jets need him on the field. The departure of Keyshawn Johnson has created a need for a fast, big receiver, and Green is 6 feet 2 inches and 205 pounds, with enough speed to stretch the field. The Jets talked to Sean Dawkins but did not sign him, and Carl Pickens remains a Bengal. Green could have stayed with the Dolphins after his third season, which was bedeviled by hamstring and ankle injuries, but he would have had to take a pay cut, and he and his mother agreed that a change of atmosphere might be good for him. The Jets scooped him up for one year at $275,000.</p>
        <p>''We thought it was a project worth pursuing,'' Coach Al Groh said. ''At one time, he had terrific vertical speed. We might hit on it, we might not. If we do, he's a young player; we'd have him for a long time.''</p>
        <p>The Jets made no promises to Green. He is one in a line of receivers who run, stop short and cut, then go back to the line. The fragile knees have held up. Now Green is trying to heal his career.</p>
        <p>''Of course I feel I have a lot of potential,'' he said. ''If I stay healthy and build some confidence, I'll be fine. I felt if I came in, I can compete with the best of them. I'm just happy I'm still in the league. A lot of people wouldn't even be on the field. I'm just grateful.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>On the last play of the afternoon practice, the backup left offensive tackle GREG LOTYSZ went down with a left knee injury and was carted off the field. Lotysz backs up JASON FABINI, who is coming off his own knee injury. If Lotysz's injury proves to be serious, the Jets may have to sign a tackle. Before Lotysz's injury, Coach AL GROH said that bringing back JUMBO ELLIOTT, who retired during the off-season and is recovering from back surgery, would be an option if the offensive line suffered injuries. The Jets retain Elliott's rights, but he would have to serve a two-game suspension in the 2000 season for his role in a bar fight last summer. . . . With SHANE BURTON out with a broken toe, the Jets signed defensive end ANTHONY COOK to a one-year contract Saturday. Cook, 6-3, 295 pounds, is in his sixth season and last year started seven games for the Washington Redskins, where he played for MIKE NOLAN, then with the Redskins and now the Jets' defensive coordinator.</p>
