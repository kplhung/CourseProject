        <p>IT is usually easy to get a handle on the work of an artist who has had a long career; material is ample. In the case of an artist who is starting out, the task is to divine the future direction.</p>
        <p>Assessing the work of a productive artist whose career was cut short can be a conundrum, for there are often a lot of loose ends. To perpetuate such an artist's reputation, it is necessary to gather the disparate pieces to produce a compelling picture of that artist.</p>
        <p>Such is the situation around Michael Malpass, a sculptor and longtime resident of Brick, N.J., who died in 1991 at 45. He was a student and then a teacher at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and spent 20 years at the school. In the late 1980's he moved to the Jersey shore, where he and his family already had a summer house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malpass's career was, in a sense, an uncomplicated straight line, because he became more proficient and more inventive with the rugged techniques of forging and welding. He had a prestigious gallery in New York, the Betty Parsons Gallery. ''After being rejected downtown, he told me he was going to start at the top,'' recalled his wife, Cathy Malpass, ''and Betty Parsons on 57th Street was the first place he tried.''</p>
        <p>He was single-minded, too, in being captivated by the sphere. Mr. Malpass regarded it in the classical way, as the most perfect shape. He made spheres of many sizes, with many different, often complex surfaces.</p>
        <p>A number of spheres, no two alike, were shown recently at the Laurel Tracey Gallery here. Some were huge with scaly surfaces, others were smaller and more delicate. One recalls Celtic interlacing. One was an assemblage of nuts and bolts deftly bent to comprise an almost-perfect globe. Another diminutive one looked like a battered baseball. Some were displayed on pedestals but others were on the wooden floor, and could potentially move, a presentation that underscored their vitality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malpass played football in high school, and on a videotape shot by his nephew he looks it. The tape is essentially instructional. On it, he welds small sections of pipe to embed in the surface of a bronze sphere. In its how-to mode, the tape might be as exciting as an Army training film, but it is of interest to anyone trying to get a more rounded picture of this artist. The proceedings are enlivened considerably by his engaging personality and his patter, which is often reflective.</p>
        <p>It took him six months to realize a sculpture. ''Making art is like a job,'' he tells his audience. ''It is a job. It's many different things. . . . It's a long process, but it's kind of nice, like life is.''</p>
        <p>In the sphere of everyday life, Mrs. Malpass recalled, her husband had a network of people, including the mailman, who used to supply him with scrap metal. A piece with a large component of donated metal would be dedicated to the donor.</p>
        <p>The exhibition was an important one, because it extended and enriched Mr. Malpass's image by showing a different, serendipitous body of work -- a cache of fresh and fertile pencil and ink drawings, many of which incorporated small pieces of collage, which were in Mr. Malpass's private notebooks. They had never been exhibited and were not expressly intended to be, but Laurel Bissonette, the gallery director, feels sure that he would have wanted these drawings to be shown.</p>
        <p>While they are intensely personal, there is nothing disturbing in them. They are gently autobiographical. In one drawing, a map of part of New York's Westchester County refers to his birthplace in Yonkers and his wife's in nearby Eastchester. ''We were high school sweethearts,'' Mrs. Malpass said.</p>
        <p>Most drawings contain near their bottom edge a sensitive rendering of a fish, a different species each time. ''Fishing was one of his passions, mine too,'' Mrs. Malpass said.  Since they weren't formal works, most have no titles. But some drawings have tantalizing, oblique ones.</p>
        <p>The one with the map of Westchester is ambiguously called ''Grass.'' Many drawings contain an area of abstraction, a linear network like a maze. This pattern is repeated in a sculpture, ''Mark,'' named, not after a small unit of art making, but after a friend. One drawing has this meandering pattern contained in a square and is called ''Window.'' In ''Butterfly,'' however, no butterfly is in sight, but the fish in it is florid, so there might be an analogy.</p>
        <p>A potent feature of many of the drawings is a penciled self-portrait that emerges from the composition and, even though it is sketchy, comes to dominate it. There is serenity in the face, but it's the face of a middle-aged man. ''I think he aged himself deliberately,'' Ms. Bissonnette said. ''It's like a joke on us.''</p>
        <p>Exhibitions often have several reasons for being, and one of them was to indicate to Mrs. Malpass and Ms. Bissonnette possible directions to take the artist's estate. Even though each of his spheres is unique, there's the possibility of making editions of some of them. ''They'd have to be small editions, three at the most,'' Mrs. Malpass said. Ms. Bissonnette said she might put on ''From a Volume to a Line.'' A rather cerebral exhibition Mr. Malpass had wanted to do.</p>
        <p>Something completely different in attitude is indicated by another observation by Ms. Bissonnette: ''When he finished making a sphere, he would often unwind by using the welding torch as a pencil, and cut out shapes from a flat sheet of metal. A lot of the shapes were chickens, and I might do a chicken show.''</p>
