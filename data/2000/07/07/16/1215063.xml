        <p>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams  By Wayne Johnston. Anchor, $14.</p>
        <p>The protagonist of this biographical novel is the weedy but ambitious Joe Smallwood, who helped steer the incorporation of the vast, mysterious island of Newfoundland into Canada and became the province's first premier. ''Johnston's eloquent anti-epic is in its thorny way a respectful tribute to a place more willful than even its toughest inhabitants,'' Luc Sante wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>No Other Book: Selected Essays  By Randall Jarrell. Edited by Brad Leithauser.  Perennial/HarperCollins, $15.</p>
        <p>This collection of the poet's major critical essays contains many valuations and opinions -- about the pre-eminence of Frost, Eliot and Stevens in the 20th-century pantheon of American poets, for example -- that were once considered provocative but have become orthodoxy today. ''He was astute, insightful, passionate, sympathetic and remarkably prophetic,'' Brooke Allen wrote here last year. In The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief, by James Wood (Modern Library, $14.95), a combative critic explores the transition from religious belief to literary belief in the 19th century, and the effects of that shift on practitioners of fiction from Melville to Pynchon. ''It is the excess, the polemical drive, that makes him exhilarating to read, often to be instructed by, sometimes to argue with,'' William H. Pritchard said in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>My Russian  By Deirdre McNamer. Ballantine, $14.</p>
        <p>After her husband is wounded by an intruder and her lover, a Russian gardener, drops out of sight, this novel's middle-aged heroine assumes another identity to spy on her own life and try to correct its course. ''McNamer is a careful writer, a master of the small, telling observation,'' Susan Bolotin wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Juneteenth  By Ralph Ellison. Edited by John F. Callahan.  Vintage International, $14.</p>
        <p>This tale of a racist white senator raised as black, assembled from voluminous notes after Ellison's death in 1994, never coheres as his second novel, Louis Menand said here last year. As a stew of various African-American oral traditions, however, ''it is an interesting experiment'' that features ''some quite Joycean riffs.''</p>
        <p>The Majors: In Pursuit of Golf's Holy Grail  By John Feinstein. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95.</p>
        <p>A reporter surveys 1998's four major championships -- the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship -- and the human dramas among both winners and losers. ''If you want to know how touring pros think, on and off the course,'' Dave Anderson wrote here last year, ''this is the book.''</p>
        <p>The Meme Machine  By Susan Blackmore. Oxford University, $14.95.</p>
        <p>A psychologist sets out a Darwinian theory of cultural evolution in which ''replicators'' -- words, beliefs and other packets of shared data -- behave as biological genes to drive human behavior. Last year in the Book Review, Robert Wright called this an ''earnest and engaging, if not wholly persuasive, book.''</p>
        <p>Trumpet  By Jackie Kay. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.</p>
        <p>This Scottish novel about a famous trumpet player, which features several narrators, is evidently inspired by the life of the American jazz musician Billy Tipton, who passed as a man until her death in 1989. The book ''leaves us with a broad landscape of sweet tolerance and familial love,'' Aoibheann Sweeney said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>No One Left to Lie To:  The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton  By Christopher Hitchens. Verso, $10.</p>
        <p>An unabashed Clinton hater makes his case with a blunt assessment of the president's personal flaws and amazing manipulative skills. Even if his attack is obsessive, Karen Lehrman said here last year, ''Hitchens's brave willingness to show all the sordid scenarios in which our emperor has removed his clothes is beyond refreshing.'' In Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story, by Michael Isikoff (Three Rivers, $14), the journalist responsible for many of the revelations about Bill Clinton's sexual indiscretions defends his work and explains how he lost scoops because of his editors' hesitations. ''Isikoff makes a plausible case . . . for continuing to pursue a story that could possibly have brought down a president,'' Tom Goldstein wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Surrender, Dorothy  By Meg Wolitzer.  Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.</p>
        <p>This novel explores the aftershocks of a woman's sudden death on her friends and family, in particular the strange jealousies that emerge among the survivors. In 1999 our reviewer, Sylvia Brownrigg, admired the author's ''knack for wry comedy'' and her ''easy and astute'' observations about her characters' lives.</p>
        <p>The Boy in the Lake  By Eric Swanson. St. Martin's Griffin, $11.95.</p>
        <p>In this elegiac novel, a New York therapist returns to his Ohio hometown after his grandmother's death and tries to make up with a boyhood lover whom he had cruelly betrayed. ''Swanson writes surely, sometimes beautifully,'' Peter Kurth wrote here last year.</p>
