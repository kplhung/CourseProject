        <p>Mark McGrath, frontman for the rock band Sugar Ray, exudes charisma. His female fans think he is the ultimate heartthrob, and male fans want to be him. He also heads up one of the most enjoyable, versatile rock bands riding a commercial high.</p>

        <p>Mark McGrath, frontman for the rock band Sugar Ray, exudes charisma. His female fans think he is the ultimate heartthrob, and male fans want to be him. He also heads up one of the most enjoyable, versatile rock bands riding a commercial high.</p>
        <p>Their last album was titled ''14:59,'' a self-deprecating jab at accusations that they were a one-hit wonder band thanks to their first ubiquitous hit ''Fly,'' a tempting combination of rock and dancehall.</p>
        <p>Just one second away from the end of their 15 minutes of fame, something funny happened: ''14:59'' was touted as one of the year's best albums and brought them to rock star status.</p>
        <p>At 7:30 tonight at the A&amp;P Tennis Classic and Music Festival in Mahwah, Sugar Ray is the headliner. Question of the day: Will there be fireworks when Mark McGrath meets up with Anna Kournikova?</p>
