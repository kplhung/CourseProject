        <p>FORMER farm fields in a quiet backwater of this bustling East End village are being turned into an enclave of period houses, complete with a village green. The development, Cedar Farms, is just one example of the current fashion in the Hamptons for new houses that appear to have stepped back in time.</p>
        <p>''People want a new house with all the amenities like modern lighting, modern appliances, alarm systems and built-in speaker systems, high ceilings and lots of windows, but at the same time, they like the house to look old,'' said David Silvera, a Manhattan-based developer who builds on the East End.</p>

        <p>FORMER farm fields in a quiet backwater of this bustling East End village are being turned into an enclave of period houses, complete with a village green. The development, Cedar Farms, is just one example of the current fashion in the Hamptons for new houses that appear to have stepped back in time.</p>
        <p>''People want a new house with all the amenities like modern lighting, modern appliances, alarm systems and built-in speaker systems, high ceilings and lots of windows, but at the same time, they like the house to look old,'' said David Silvera, a Manhattan-based developer who builds on the East End.</p>
        <p>Barbara Morrill, an associate broker with Strough Real Estate Associates in Bridgehampton, who is in charge of sales at Cedar Farms, said that buyers are seeking the old-world charm that period houses in the Hamptons offer but that they are not prepared to tackle the renovations many of the older houses need.</p>
        <p>Cedar Farms is being developed by Frederick W. Muhlbauer of Sag Harbor with two partners, Aldo Caperna of Merrick and Ambrose Splescia of Wantagh. They purchased the 17-acre property in 1992 for $310,000 at a bankruptcy sale.</p>
        <p>One of the subdivision's 13 lots has been sold to a neighbor, and the remaining 12, which range in size from a half acre to an acre, are to be developed with an eclectic mix of houses, ''just as you would see a mix of styles in old neighborhoods,'' Mr. Muhlbauer said. Prices start at $795,000 for a three-bedroom, 2,500-square-foot house and range up to $995,000 for one with five bedrooms and 4,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>The first, a four-bedroom side-hall colonial, priced at $895,000, is almost completed; construction on the second, a four-bedroom Williamsburg colonial with a two-bedroom guest suite over the garage, is to start in September. The price will be $995,000. An ornate four-bedroom Victorian, also priced at $995,000, will follow.</p>
        <p>Because the village required clustering, eight of the 17 acres, including the one-acre village green, will remain undeveloped. The road and the preserved acreage -- which five of the lots adjoin -- are to be owned by the village. The central green, planted with fruit trees, is to be maintained by a homeowners' association.</p>
        <p>The side-hall colonial, with its simple lines, divided pane windows and bucolic setting shaded by a large oak tree, looks like a house that might have been there for a century or more.</p>
        <p>Wood shingles have been used on the roof and as siding, and the leaders and gutters are made of copper. The house rests on a brick foundation, and the two-car garage is out of sight in the rear, concealed beneath a large deck. Fieldstone salvaged from old farm walls in Pennsylvania has been used for the low stone walls planted with lavender that encircle the house.</p>
        <p>The interior has 10-foot ceilings, gas heat and the same air-conditioning, plumbing and wiring systems as other new houses. But the wrapping is early American.</p>
        <p>A sun room has a tin ceiling, a brick floor and a brick fireplace with a raised hearth. Separating the dining room from the kitchen are old pocket doors that Mr. Muhlbauer found in a wrecking yard in Stamford, Conn. Old wood mantels frame the three fireplaces, and antique sconces will flank the living room fireplace. Two of the three full bathrooms, including the master bathroom, have clawfoot tubs and Victorian-style pedestal sinks with imported brass fixtures.</p>
        <p>The designs reflect a market in which contemporary houses and even postmodern ones are out, said Frank Newbold, a senior vice president of Sotheby's International Realty and also the head of its East Hampton office.</p>
        <p>''The newest and hottest houses on the market are the almost exact reproductions of older houses,'' Mr. Newbold said. ''Builders in fact use old materials like barn siding and antique floors from old buildings that have been reclaimed. They even stain the shingles so that they look instantly old.''</p>
        <p>IT is, Mr. Newbold said, a welcome trend, because much attention is also being paid to blending the houses into their neighborhoods. ''In the 80's and 90's, houses often looked as if a helicopter had dropped them onto the lot and they had no relationship to the neighborhood,'' he said. ''Now people keep the streetscape in mind and what would be appropriate there.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Colle, the owner of J. C. Construction Management in East Hampton, who renovates period homes and replicates them in new construction, said that building new houses is a lot easier.</p>
        <p>''Modernizing electrical and plumbing systems translates into a lot of time and a lot of money, and you are also limited in what you can do,'' he said. ''The ceilings are generally very low and the rooms are often small.'' To help achieve the look of an older house, Mr. Colle uses components from old houses that once stood in other areas of the country and in Canada that he purchases and has taken apart. The pieces he wants to use are all numbered before being shipped.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing like the charm and the warmth of an old floor,'' he said. ''And because floors are such a visual component of a house, it really helps to translate that old feeling.'' The same goes for hand-hewn beams that he uses for ceilings, he said.</p>
        <p>One house on which he is about to start  construction is on two and a half acres overlooking Northwest Harbor in East Hampton. It is modeled on the sloped-roof gable-style houses that Stanford White was known for, Mr. Colle said. The five-bedroom house, to be priced at $3 million, is to have several covered porches, some screened, some open, on both its first and second floors.</p>
        <p>The stacked-stone foundation is to be made of Vermont stone. The pine floors are to come from an old New England house that was dismantled. The fireplace mantels will be constructed of old pine.</p>
        <p>John David Rose, an architect with offices in Southampton, said that ''from a style standpoint, most of my clients want homes that look as if they have been there for 100 years because the shingle style, when done properly, blends right in.''</p>
        <p>''The biggest compliment I can get,'' Mr. Rose said, ''is if someone looks at a new house of mine and says, 'I thought that was an old home.' ''</p>
        <p>Yet interiors are very open and airy. A large country kitchen, for example, will open up to the dining area and to a family room ''so it's one big room and a space where everyone gets together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Classic houses are also very practical, he said. Traditional materials like wood shingles are very durable and relatively maintenance-free, and traditional-style roofs with their large overhangs protect windows and siding. ''The reason these houses work so well today is the same reason they worked 100 years ago,'' he said. ''People like low maintenance and homes that last.''</p>
        <p>Toni Curto, a principal of Curto &amp; Curto, a Southampton building company, said that all her clients these days want traditional architecture. ''Contemporary architecture going back to the 80's has become very tired looking,'' she said, ''but there was such extraordinary detailing, window shapes and roof lines in the Old World architecture that people have gone back to it because it is ageless.''</p>
        <p>A 7,200-square-foot, six-bedroom house that she currently has under construction and on the market for $4.2 million is on a two-acre waterfront parcel fronting on Burnett's Creek in Southampton.</p>
        <p>Although the house replicates the details of the shingle-style cottage so popular in the Hamptons at the turn of the century, ''people are getting things that are on the edge in terms of heating, air-conditioning and a gorgeous kitchen,'' she said. ''These are amenities that you wouldn't be able to find in an older house.''</p>
        <p>Stephen DiCarmine, the executive director of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, a Manhattan law firm, is buying a four-bedroom Cape Cod-style house in Sagaponack from Alfred P. Tuff, a Bridgehampton builder. Mr. DiCarmine said that he had owned several houses but that this is his first new house.</p>
        <p>The home, which is costing him $595,000,  is under construction and should be completed by the end of August.</p>
        <p>''I have a beautiful old-style screened-in porch with a wainscoted ceiling and wainscoted walls,'' he said. ''I have a beautiful brick fireplace.''</p>
        <p>Yet the windows are very large and open and the rooms flow into each other as they would in a contemporary house, making the space great for entertaining, he said. The screened porch leads out to a barbecue area and a lap swimming pool.</p>
        <p>''It's just a wonderful combination of old and new ideas,'' Mr. DiCarmine said. ''It is a house that gives you the best of both.''</p>
