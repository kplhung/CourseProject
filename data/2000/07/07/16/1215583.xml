        <p>KAUFMANN-Evelyn L. A resident of Rancho Mirage, CA, for over 20 years, died on July 8, 2000. Born in New York City, on October 21, 1910, she was a graduate of The Dalton School, and a Member of Sunningdale Country Club. In the years since the death of her husband, Fred W. Kaufmann, Jr., a Principal of Erdman &amp; Company, Mrs. Kaufmann, a Member of Tamarisk Country Club, was a highly regarded bridge player and an enthusiastic supporter of many local charities, and a woman of singular intelligence and independence. She is survived by her son, F. William Kaufmann, 3rd, two grandchildren, Frederick Clark Kaufmann, and Katheryn Frances Chafkin, and two great grandchildren, Julia and Will Chafkin. A private gathering was held at her home. The family suggests donations be send to The Eisenhower Medical Center, or any other desert charity.</p>
