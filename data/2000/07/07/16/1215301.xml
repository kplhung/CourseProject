        <p>A blush wine is simply a rose by another name. If there's a distinction, it's only poetic: Blush is associated with youth; rose implies a few more drops of maturity. By this definition, Alba Vineyard's New Jersey Blush is accurately named.</p>
        <p>First, its bright salmon-coral color has the verve of a new gown for a high school prom. Second, its flirtatious bouquet of berries, tea roses and candy has the charm of a corsage pinned on the gown. Third, it ''misbehaves'': you are teased into expecting sweetness, but the wine comes dry.</p>

        <p>A blush wine is simply a rose by another name. If there's a distinction, it's only poetic: Blush is associated with youth; rose implies a few more drops of maturity. By this definition, Alba Vineyard's New Jersey Blush is accurately named.</p>
        <p>First, its bright salmon-coral color has the verve of a new gown for a high school prom. Second, its flirtatious bouquet of berries, tea roses and candy has the charm of a corsage pinned on the gown. Third, it ''misbehaves'': you are teased into expecting sweetness, but the wine comes dry.</p>
        <p>This pop wine (not vintage-dated but coming from 1999 grapes) was made Rudy Marchese, an owner of the 18-year-old Alba, in Finesville, Warren County. It is an agreeable sipper for lunchtime in the backyard or at the beach -- a guzzler, for some -- that easily substitutes for many white zinfandels filling merchants' shelves.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey Blush is produced from Marechal Foch,'' a red French hybrid that flourishes in the Northeast, and from ''the rieslinglike hybrid developed by Cornell, Cayuga white,'' Mr. Marchese said.</p>
        <p>In a homey touch, the label, depicting a painting by the artist Dan Campanelli, shows ''one of the many historic buildings in the rural villages surrounding the vineyards from which this wine is produced,'' the bottle says.</p>
        <p>The wine costs $7 at Alba, which can identify stores and restaurants throughout the state that carry it.</p>
