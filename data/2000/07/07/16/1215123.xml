        <p>James Iha  Guitarist  Smashing Pumpkins</p>
        <p>As far as the Smashing Pumpkins, it always ran on hard work, music and motivation. Our bass player was the only woman, and it wasn't an issue. It's based on what you can do. American audiences tend to be white, but we tour the whole world and do have a mixed audience. Symbolically, I think it's a good thing for other Asian kids to see me in this big band. I've met a lot of them, and they say, ''It's great to see a Japanese person in this cool band.''</p>
        <p>Growing up in suburban Chicago, I was always the only Asian person in my school. I can't say I've never seen racism. I definitely had my fair share. Just the typical, stupid things that kids say. But I never really had a problem, and personally, it never held me back.</p>
        <p>I think things are getting better. There's less and less racial division in music, with hip-hop and rock 'n' roll mixing, and music is more global now, instead of just American or European. Now hip-hop is king, and I think it's great. When I was in high school, it was kind of underground. Now, when you go to buy a record, no race is implied.</p>
