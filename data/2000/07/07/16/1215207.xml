        <p>LIKE many of Italy's trattorias, Gina Marie's is a tiny neighborhood place here. But what it lacks in space, it makes up for in portions -- all served family style on huge platters that dwarf table tops.</p>
        <p>First-time diners be warned: there is no indication that the kitchen serves these gigantic servings until they arrive. Gina Marie's specializes in la cucina lotsa: lotsa tomato sauce, lotsa cheese, lotsa food. That philosophy, along with the homespun merriment of the place, apparently pleases lotsa people, who, on most evenings, are happy to line up for their turn at this bounty. The food is not bad -- once one recovers from the shock of how much there is.</p>

        <p>LIKE many of Italy's trattorias, Gina Marie's is a tiny neighborhood place here. But what it lacks in space, it makes up for in portions -- all served family style on huge platters that dwarf table tops.</p>
        <p>First-time diners be warned: there is no indication that the kitchen serves these gigantic servings until they arrive. Gina Marie's specializes in la cucina lotsa: lotsa tomato sauce, lotsa cheese, lotsa food. That philosophy, along with the homespun merriment of the place, apparently pleases lotsa people, who, on most evenings, are happy to line up for their turn at this bounty. The food is not bad -- once one recovers from the shock of how much there is.</p>
        <p>Appetizers and pastas were the dishes of choice. If house salad doesn't come with your main dish, consider ordering it anyway. The refreshing, coarsely chopped greens were tossed with black olives, diced tomatoes (a tad pale) and simple dressing of oil and vinegar.</p>
        <p>With the kind of turnover Gina Marie's enjoys, seafood promised to be sparkling fresh, and it was. Fat clams possillipo were luscious in marinara sauce so good that we dunked chunks of bread to sop every drop. And seafood salad, a cool melange of shrimp, scallops, calamari and scungilli in a light marinade of celery, lemon and just the right dose of oil and garlic could not have been more straightforward or pleasing.</p>
        <p>Mushroom caps filled with a somewhat bready crab mixture were prettily arranged around a center of spinach. Better, however, were three rolls of freshly made ricotta-stuffed eggplant topped with mozzarella.</p>
        <p>The menu is long, and the seating capacity small; but a dozen different pastas were cooked perfectly and employed in two dozen different dishes. In the face of trendy designer pasta dishes, it was a pleasure to see good old spaghetti bolognese making a comeback, and we wonder why it was ever abandoned. No watery ersatz bolognese here. Gina Marie's was so thick with ground meats and vegetables that it could have been eaten with a fork. Other offerings paled only by comparison.</p>
        <p>Piled in a basin, a mess of capellini vodka arrived loaded with seafood. Rigatoni with young broccoli rape (not at all bitter) and lots of fresh sliced garlic needed only a sprinkling of cheese to meld the flavors. And cream-based and mellow, rigatoni monte mare with small shrimp also had young, wilted leaves of arugula, of which we wished for more.</p>
        <p>Vinegared peppers brought spark to juicy chicken scarpariello, which here is cooked on the bone, the way we prefer. But fragrant chicken balsamico lost points for being overly salted, usually not a problem here. Chicken parmigiano proved standard: breaded cutlets in tomato sauce, all under a load of mozzarella.</p>
        <p>Despite overly floured cream sauce, filet mignon Gina Marie made an exotic entry; thick slices of tender beef were covered with sauce sweetened by raisins, pear and a dash of brandy. But with so much attention focused on appetizers and pasta, it was not surprising to find a few entrees falling short of the mark. Red snapper marechiara was overcooked and watery. Garlic and lemon flavored the unpeeled, butterflied shrimp scampi alla Gina Marie; the off-note was the heavy coating of bread crumbs and oil. Potato or pasta come with the entrees, but spring for a side order of sauteed spinach or broccoli rape.</p>
        <p>For the few with room for dessert, orange sorbet, coconut gelato or poached pear (without zabaglione) was refreshing.</p>
        <p>The price range is broad. With some sharing, a three-course dinner averages $25 without drinks, tax and tip. Gina Marie's is just south of the Cross County Parkway.</p>
        <p>Gina Marie's Trattoria  546 Gramatan Avenue, Mount Vernon. 667-5200.</p>
        <p>GOOD</p>
