        <p>Evan Wolfson letter responds to July 9 Word for Word column, which excerpted Boy Scouts of America handbook in light of Supreme Court ruling that Scouts may exclude homosexuals; warns Boy Scouts will lose support to other groups that do not discriminate against gay members (M)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A July 9 Week in Review article is correct in pointing out that the Boy Scouts of America's own materials make no statements against gay members, but there is another key element in their handbook: the definition of ''morally straight.'' The book advises: ''To be a person of strong character, guide your life with honesty, purity and justice. Respect and defend the rights of all people.''</p>
        <p>My client James Dale had an exemplary and highly decorated record as a Scout. He was expelled solely because he is gay. While the Boy Scouts of America embrace discrimination, its leaders cannot expect special government privileges or sponsorship from public schools and police and fire departments.</p>

        <p>Many former supporters will channel their support instead to groups like the 4-H Club, Girl Scouts, Campfire Boys and Girls and the Boys and the Girls Clubs, which do not promote discrimination against gay members.</p>
