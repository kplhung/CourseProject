        <p>THE day was officially over now, and C. J. Hunter pulled his  6-foot-1-inch, 300-pound frame down a dusty road behind Hornet Stadium yesterday for mandatory postcompetition drug testing.</p>
        <p>What a great day. Hunter, the world champion in the shot-put, had made his second consecutive Olympic team. Hunter did not win the event -- he finished second to Adam Nelson with a personal-best throw of 71-9 -- but life was good.</p>
        <p>About five minutes earlier, Hunter had stood with a group and watched his wife, Marion Jones, put a choke  hold on the 100 meters, winning the final with the second-fastest women's time in the world this year. She ran 10.88 seconds into a headwind, leaving Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines to battle for second and third.</p>
        <p>''What she does is more important than what I do,'' Hunter said. ''I'll stop today, right now, if it would mean she would achieve her goal.''</p>
        <p>On Friday, a different, more protective, side of the Hunter-Jones relationship had surfaced.</p>
        <p>Hunter qualified for the finals with a single throw in the qualifying rounds, then he did not talk with the news media. Jones had easily won her 100-meter heat and was in the news media room answering questions. About seven minutes into the session, Hunter came into the room, gave the cut sign to end the interviews, and he and Jones left. No explanations. No backward glances.</p>
        <p>This is one of the most compelling relationships in track and field.</p>
        <p>Hunter has often been recognized more as his wife's bodyguard than as a world-class shot-putter. In a commercial for Nike, Hunter throws a grapefruit across supermarket lanes as his wife sprints to catch it.</p>
        <p>Jones has set the goal of winning five gold medals in the Sydney Games -- in the 100 and 200 meters, in the long jump and in the 4x100 and 4x400 relays. She is adamant. ''I want to go and win everything I'm entered in,'' she said. ''If something happens and I don't win all five, I'll have to cope with that. But I don't think I could live with myself if I didn't try.''</p>
        <p>Hunter is the sergeant-at-arms. Whenever his wife began to second-guess herself or falter on her Olympic mission, Hunter roared in and defended her. ''Anyone who is going there not wanting to win in all the events they've entered shouldn't be there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For much of the last three track seasons, Jones has been the female version of Michael Johnson, a super runner winning almost every event she has entered.</p>
        <p>But last year, there was a hint of change in the dynamic of the relationship that saw Jones as the celebrity, the champion, and Hunter as an athlete attempting to break through. In Seville, Spain, at the world championships last August, Hunter won the world championship in the shot-put, and Jones, after winning the 100 meters, collapsed during the 200 with lower back spasms, her goal of four gold medals disintegrating.</p>
        <p>Now Hunter is emerging as an international force. Yesterday he was asked how much the family dynamic would change if he, known for so many years as Marion Jones's husband, began to carve out a championship niche of his own.</p>
        <p>''I'm really not into all that,'' Hunter said. ''It's cool to have fun with it, but I do it because I'm good at it, not because I love it so much.'' He added: ''Seventeen years is a long time. It's been -- what year is this? 2000? -- Seventeen years is a long time.''</p>
        <p>Jones, on the other hand, by her own admission, does not deal well with losing. ''I don't handle it very well and I'm not good at dealing with the time when I'm hurt and not competing,'' she said. ''On occasion, when I don't win, I have a chance to revert to ways I don't like. And I don't like myself when I'm not winning. I'm cranky, quiet and depressed until my next competition.''</p>
        <p>Hunter can be engaging, he can be short and intimidating. He is usually not interested in elaborating or telling stories.</p>
        <p>Now Hunter is coming into his own. He was ranked No. 1 in the world in 1995 and was a favorite for a gold in the 1996 Atlanta Games when he injured his hamstring warming up for the Olympic trials. He made the team but finished seventh.</p>
        <p>With yesterday's performance, Hunter is on track to win the gold. He has a coach for the first time since college, and he is the favorite in the shot-put with Jones the favorite in the sprints.</p>
        <p>But Hunter said yesterday that these Games would be his last. ''Australia is my last one,'' he said. ''I'll defend my world championship next year, but I'm not going to do a lot of meets. Australia is it. This is it.''</p>
        <p>Who knows how this will turn out?</p>
        <p>Hunter grunts: ''The less I'm in the spotlight, the better.''</p>
        <p>Jones enthuses about her husband. ''He keeps me safe,'' she said. ''It's not about track and field. It's about a loving relationship. It's about family.''</p>
        <p>Hunter repeated. ''This is it for me,'' he said. ''After that, I got plans.''</p>
