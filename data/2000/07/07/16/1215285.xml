        <p>I PLANTED my first hydrangea (Hydrangea anomala petiolaris) beside the old smokehouse down on the farm, and it just sat there, like a raggedy bunch of sticks, for a few years. I was prepared for this, having read that the climbers take a while to establish their roots. And besides, I had a vision.</p>
        <p>I had seen one winding up an old oak tree on Long Island years before, and its lateral branches fanned out like long arms, cloaked in dark green heart-shaped leaves and laced with flowers that reminded me of white doilies, glimmering in the dappled shade of the oak leaves. These lacecap flowers are flat-topped clusters of tiny, greenish fertile flowers surrounded by a handful of creamy white sterile florets.</p>

        <p>I PLANTED my first hydrangea (Hydrangea anomala petiolaris) beside the old smokehouse down on the farm, and it just sat there, like a raggedy bunch of sticks, for a few years. I was prepared for this, having read that the climbers take a while to establish their roots. And besides, I had a vision.</p>
        <p>I had seen one winding up an old oak tree on Long Island years before, and its lateral branches fanned out like long arms, cloaked in dark green heart-shaped leaves and laced with flowers that reminded me of white doilies, glimmering in the dappled shade of the oak leaves. These lacecap flowers are flat-topped clusters of tiny, greenish fertile flowers surrounded by a handful of creamy white sterile florets.</p>
        <p>The climbing species have aerial rootlets that cling to walls or tree trunks without harming them, and unlike wisteria, which can destroy a brick wall or shingled roof, do no damage. Now, my eight-year-old climbing hydrangea is rambling over the smokehouse, forming a wonderful cover for the birds that hop about the feeder near the kitchen window. And in winter, the flaky cinnamon-colored bark of the woody vines forms a striking pattern against the building's white walls.</p>
        <p>Over the years, I have admired other species, like the oakleaf hydrangea, H. quercifolia, so-called for its deeply lobed leaves, which turn a purplish bronze in the fall. The botanist William Bartram discovered this species blooming on the banks of the Altamaha River in Georgia in the 1770's, and in his ''Travels in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida,'' he described it growing in copses, spreading by stems that rose six feet  from rambling roots.</p>
        <p>The footlong panicles start out creamy white, then turn successively rose and russet, remaining on the shrub all winter. And though it's a Southerner, this plant is hardy to Zone 5, coming back from the roots when killed down to the ground.</p>
        <p>H. quercifolia can make a wonderful unpruned hedge or border, or clumped in twos or threes to light up an open woodland garden. It seems to do best in light shade, as the leaves tend to dry out and lose their color in full sun. Hydrangeas also do not cotton to lime, which is good news for those of us with acid soil.</p>
        <p>I also love the old-fashioned H. paniculata grandiflora, called peegee hydrangea (for p.g., its initials), which garden snobs scorn for being  overused, but as with bell-bottoms, what goes around comes around. Paniculata is easily pruned as a tree, which grows to 30 feet, with panicles of white flowers that turn pinkish-purple, then brown, like the one that captured my heart years ago on a country road in Oyster Bay, on Long Island. This spring, as I planted H. paniculata, only four feet high, I tipped my cap to that old beauty.</p>
        <p>The genus hydrangea includes more than 100 species, all woody shrubs or vines, with flowers ranging from the lacecap type to mopheads (which some call hortensias) to footlong pyramids. And the family keeps expanding, thanks to plant explorers like Daniel Hinkley, owner of Heronswood Nursery in Kingston, Wash., who has brought back many new forms, from a mophead Hydrangea aspera from the mountains in Sichuan, China, to a climbing evergreen species collected in Chile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinkley's Heronswood catalog lists more than 80 cultivars, including many macrophyllas (so familiar to beach-side porches) ranging in color from blue to ''lemon souffle braised with a raspberry glaze.'' The catalog is an invaluable primer on the care and cultivation of hydrangeas, offering descriptions of the different species and their cultivars.</p>
        <p>You can help your macrophyllas turn a more intense blue by making the soil more acidic. Mr. Hinkley suggests digging in peat moss before planting, and applying a nitrate-based fertilizer like 25-5-30. Or try adding aluminum sulfate. Conversely, redder hues respond to more alkaline soil, so add lime. But he warns that with very acidic soil (below 5.5) or very alkaline soil (above 7), ''it is virtually impossible to modify your soil pH to a degree sufficient to change the color of any hydrangea.''</p>
        <p>Two other texts are ''Hydrangeas: A Gardeners' Guide,'' by Toni Lawson-Hall and Brian Rothera (Timber Press, 1998) and ''Ornamental Shrubs, Climbers and Bamboos,'' by Graham Stuart Thomas (Sagapress/ Timber Press, 1992). Mr. Thomas describes these plants to a T, and tells what looks good with them. H. arborescens Grandiflora, for example, found growing wild in Ohio around 1800, produces big creamy flower heads so heavy they droop on their stems. Turn that weakness into a strength by letting them hang over low walls, Mr. Thomas advises. Plant Japanese anemones, he suggests, with H. aspera macrophylla, which has large flat heads of mauve flowers surrounded by white sterile florets, which turn pink with age.</p>
        <p>That's what I love about hydrangeas. Their faces keep changing with the seasons.</p>
