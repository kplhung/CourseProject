        <p>IT is July 4 in London, around 7 p.m., and Helen Sinclair, director of a British venture capital fund called Matrix Private Equity, is surveying the buzzing bar from a corner of the room where, at least for the moment, she can relax. ''As a red dot, I get swamped,'' Ms. Sinclair says, looking somewhat exhausted. ''I meet green dots for only three minutes each and can usually get in around 40 green dots in an evening.''</p>

        <p>IT is July 4 in London, around 7 p.m., and Helen Sinclair, director of a British venture capital fund called Matrix Private Equity, is surveying the buzzing bar from a corner of the room where, at least for the moment, she can relax. ''As a red dot, I get swamped,'' Ms. Sinclair says, looking somewhat exhausted. ''I meet green dots for only three minutes each and can usually get in around 40 green dots in an evening.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinclair is referring to a surreal new social order that springs up in more than 80 cities around the world on the first Tuesday of every month. In fashionable watering holes, entrepreneurs identified by the green dots on their name tags seek out investors, identified by red dots, while a third subculture, identified by yellow dots, simply hobnobs, in case its members ever want to become red or green dots.</p>
        <p>What began as an informal networking party on Oct. 2, 1998, at the Alphabet bar in London's Soho for 80 people working in the new economy has grown into something of a worldwide phenomenon. A bevy of imitators have sprung up, too. And those who created the first gathering in London have incorporated as a start-up business called First Tuesday, which a company founder, Julie Meyer, acknowledges is a bit of a fluke.</p>
        <p>''We're an accidental company,'' she said. ''It was totally the right place at the right time.'' Nonetheless, she is intent on expanding the concept around the globe to ''democratize the process of getting venture capital.''</p>
        <p>With one small catch. Eyeing the more than $100 million its gatherings have helped  entrepreneurs raise, First Tuesday plans to make money by taking a cut of the deals that emerge from its events.</p>
        <p>As dot-com mania expands far beyond its Silicon Valley origins, entrepreneurs and investors worldwide face many issues -- some global and some distinctly domestic. Money &amp; Business sent reporters to First Tuesday gatherings in seven cities this month to see what was on the minds and the lips of members of the dot-com economy.</p>
