        <p>INVESTORS have been bidding up more than dot-coms into the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>In a labor market squeezed tightly by the demands of a robust economy and the Internet, stocks of executive search firms have been spectacular performers of late. The stock of Korn/Ferry International has more than doubled since the company went public in February of last year, while Heidrick &amp; Struggles International, which made its debut two months later, has nearly quintupled. TMP Worldwide, which went public in 1996, has since increased more than fivefold, more than doubling in the last year alone.</p>
        <p>''The competition for talent is incredible,'' said Mitchell Rubin, a portfolio manager for Baron Capital, which owns these stocks. He credits the strong economy and a fundamental shift toward information-based businesses. ''Right now is nirvana,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By combining traditional search businesses with the promise of the Internet through online recruiting ventures, these companies appear to be making good on the promise of ''bricks into clicks,'' said Mary Lisanti, the chief investment officer for equities at Pilgrim Advisors, which owns both Korn/Ferry and Heidrick.</p>
        <p>But while these firms are benefiting tremendously from boom times, and their close but not too-close proximity to the technology sector, some analysts and investors worry about the impact when the economy slows down. These companies have been in an ''upward spiral,'' said Kenneth Broad, a portfolio manager for Franklin Templeton Investments, who has passed on these stocks. ''If and when they trip, there's a downward spiral,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The climb has surpassed expectations and shows no sign of ending anytime soon. Revenue of the 25 largest firms nearly doubled since 1996, to about $1.3 billion at the end of 1999, according to Hunt-Scanlon Advisors, a Stamford, Conn., firm that tracks the recruiting industry. Hunt-Scanlon predicts that industry revenue will grow at least 15 to 20 percent in 2000 and that online recruiting will become an $8 billion industry by 2005, up from only $250 million last year.</p>
        <p>Just last week, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the world's largest executive recruiter, said it expected to report in early August a gain of more than 40 percent in quarterly revenue -- as well as higher-than-expected earnings.</p>
        <p>The search business, already expanding overseas, could see explosive global growth as the Internet catches on. Recruiting in Latin America, Europe and Asia ''is going to be the next big phenomenon,'' said Brian P. Lee, chief marketing strategist at Hunt-Scanlon. As if to underscore the point, last week Vicente Fox Quesada, the Mexican president-elect, hired Korn/Ferry to help him fill key government positions.</p>
        <p>Investors have already been impressed with the online efforts of some companies. Heidrick offers LeadersOnline.com, which combines traditional search techniques with online tools; Korn/Ferry's Futurestep.com is aimed at middle managers.</p>
        <p>TMP Worldwide's claim to fame online is its popular Monster.com job board, for anyone seeking a job. The company has teamed with America Online to offer help-wanted ads and provides an inexpensive way to recruit, said Ann Miletti, an associate portfolio manager at Strong Capital, which owns TMP shares. ''As a firm, we use the Monster board, too,'' Ms. Miletti said. The site says it has 15.2 million unique visits a month.</p>
        <p>While some investors feel that the search companies' stocks are not yet priced to an extreme, the market has certainly been kind. Heidrick now trades at $68.46875, a 52-week high and nearly 46 times its estimated earnings per share for this year. Korn/ Ferry closed at $34, for a comparable multiple of 31. TMP, which represents more of a bet on its ability to remain the dominant Web site, trades at $77.0625, or a comparable multiple of 87.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is convinced that search  firms make for good public companies. Competitors like Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates have chosen to remain private -- at least for now. ''The market is very fickle,'' said Joseph E. Griesedieck, the chief executive of Spencer Stuart.</p>
        <p>While the current business environment puts a high value on these companies' services, investors have not always been so generous. If the search business slows, they could be quick to punish the stocks.</p>
        <p>Indeed, search firms have had trouble navigating public waters when times were not so good. Korn/Ferry, for example, was a public company briefly in the early 1970's before choosing to go private again. LAI Worldwide, formerly Lamalie Associates, which was the only public search firm for a time, was a dismal stock market performer that was bought last year by TMP.</p>
        <p>Investors also make huge demands of public companies. ''As a public firm, there is a tremendous amount of pressure to grow your revenues,'' said Mr. Lee. By contrast, the private firms ''can be a lot more selective in the assignments they take on,'' he said. Russell Reynolds and Spencer Stuart, for example, boast higher revenues per consultant than the public companies, he said.</p>
        <p>Another issue for the search industry is the general prohibition against raiding one  client company to find an executive for another. That makes it difficult to become too large a player, because too many places are off-limits, Mr. Broad said. ''It's a natural catch-22 for growth,'' he said.</p>
        <p>AND what happens if the Internet frenzy or the overall economy comes to a screeching halt? While few people predict a major slowdown anytime soon, these companies would be affected if fewer people were hopping from job to job. The level of vulnerability, however, is unclear.</p>
        <p>''They are cyclical stocks in the sense that the labor market is tight,'' said Ms. Miletti of Strong Capital. But she and the other proponents of these stocks argue that these companies would prove fairly resilient in any downturn, especially given their online activities. ''The costs are so much less, it's compelling,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Broad of Franklin Templeton is not sure. Some companies, like Korn/Ferry and Heidrick, are sometimes paid in stock warrants by start-up clients. While that has benefited them as many stocks have soared, a downturn could act ''like a magnifying glass on the stocks,'' he said. All of which might make for a pretty hard landing.</p>
