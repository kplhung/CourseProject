        <p>It isn't easy to plop a giant store that sells 36-roll packages of toilet paper into a congested city neighborhood. So Costco, the national wholesale club, thought it had a winner last summer when it came up with a model tailored for the Manhattan market. The company called it Costco Fresh and said it would specialize in food products.</p>
        <p>At 70,000 square feet, a Costco Fresh store would have been much smaller than a typical 130,000-square-foot warehouse store, but it still would have been several times the size of most supermarkets in the city.</p>

        <p>It isn't easy to plop a giant store that sells 36-roll packages of toilet paper into a congested city neighborhood. So Costco, the national wholesale club, thought it had a winner last summer when it came up with a model tailored for the Manhattan market. The company called it Costco Fresh and said it would specialize in food products.</p>
        <p>At 70,000 square feet, a Costco Fresh store would have been much smaller than a typical 130,000-square-foot warehouse store, but it still would have been several times the size of most supermarkets in the city.</p>
        <p>But as often happens in neighborhoods slated to get a so-called big-box store, community leaders in Manhattan gave Costco Fresh the kind of welcome they might normally reserve for the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>Each proposed location -- whether on 23rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, on the site of the former 14th Street Armory near the Avenue of the Americas or at 55th Street and 10th Avenue -- stirred fierce opposition.</p>
        <p>Last week, Jeffrey H. Brotman, the chairman of Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., said the company had put the Costco Fresh concept on hold.</p>
        <p>The company recently sold the two properties it had owned on 23rd and 55th Streets. (The 14th Street store would have been in leased space.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Brotman attributed the change in strategy to escalating construction costs rather than community opposition, but he made it clear that the hostility stung.</p>
        <p>''You get a variety of opinions in every community,'' Mr. Brotman said.</p>
        <p>''What sets New York apart -- I don't quite know how to explain it -- is that people are much more personal in their attacks, much more cynical in determining our motives. Nobody would accept anything I said.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brotman said Manhattan residents would lose out because Costco offered lower prices than its competitors.</p>
        <p>But John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition and one of the leaders in the anti-Costco campaign, said Mr. Brotman was missing the point.</p>
        <p>''He didn't understand New York,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''It's not that people don't want lower prices.''</p>
        <p>He said opponents were concerned about the traffic the stores would generate, the impact they would have on smaller stores, the $40 membership fee, the policy against accepting food stamps and Costco's nonunion labor force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brotman, however, said he had been willing to work with the community to resolve some of these issues and maintained that his employees were better paid and had more opportunities for advancement than union workers.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that Costco had made a profit by selling off property in a hot real estate market.</p>
        <p>''But we're not in the real estate business,'' he said. ''We'd much rather be selling mayonnaise there.''</p>
        <p>Although Costco Fresh may be dead for now, Costco, which has three other stores in New York City (in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island), says it has not abandoned its plans to enter the lucrative Manhattan market.</p>
        <p>Last year, the City Council approved a shopping center for East Harlem that includes a full-sized Costco warehouse store as one of its anchors.</p>
        <p>But the project, known as East River Plaza, has been stalled because the developers say they need public financing to pay for the required $30 million parking garage.</p>
        <p>Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist who fought Costco Fresh on behalf of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and a group of independent supermarkets known as the Neighborhood Retail Alliance, said he would turn his attention to East River Plaza.</p>
        <p>''That's a project that should not be subsidized with one nickel of public money,'' he said.</p>
