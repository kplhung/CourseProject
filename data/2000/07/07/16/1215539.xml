        <p>The police were searching last night for a mentally handicapped French teenager who was separated from his father on a Midtown subway platform, a police official said.</p>
        <p>The boy, Gregoire Madignier, 16, was standing on the southbound E train platform at the East 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue stop when the train pulled up at 6 p.m. yesterday, Detective Joseph Pentangelo said. The father, Pierre Madignier, stepped on the train, but his son did not. Mr. Madignier did not realize that his son was missing until the train was moving, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madignier told officers that his son has the mental ability of a 5-year-old, Detective Pentangelo said. The two were here as tourists and the boy cannot speak English.</p>
        <p>The police described him as white, 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 160 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a blue sweatshirt and green shorts.</p>
        <p>A search of the area near the subway station turned up nothing, Detective Pentangelo said. Transit workers were notified, and the police were widening their search.</p>
        <p>Many French expatriates and tourists, as well as Francophiles, are expected to congregate in Midtown today, where celebrations of Bastille Day are to be held.</p>
        <p>Anyone with information about Gregoire Madignier is asked to call the Midtown South Precinct at (212) 239-9811.</p>
