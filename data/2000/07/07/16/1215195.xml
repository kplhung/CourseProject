        <p>Tips on avoiding plant shock when dividing plants during summer months (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The gardening textbooks and pundits say that you should always divide perennial plants in the spring or in the fall. Unfortunately some gardeners just don't have time to divide when conditions are optimal. The good new is that lightening will not strike you if you divide in the summer, as long as you take a few precautions.</p>
        <p>First, make sure that the plant you are dividing is healthy. Torrid weather combined with transplant shock will kill an ailing specimen.  Second, muddle in your divisions, which means you should water the planting holes before the plants go in, then water again when you are finished.</p>

        <p>Third, water the divisions every day. Don't divide anything right before you go on vacation, unless you know that the fledgling plants will get tender loving care.</p>
        <p>Fourth, do not divide at midday. Direct sun wilts plants and people.</p>
