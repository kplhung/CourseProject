      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>My parents grew up in Birmingham, Ala., in the 1950's. They would tell me about the colored water fountains, about having to walk to school while the white children rode in buses (often spitting at my parents and their friends as they passed) and about how you had to act around police officers and other authority figures. They learned to ask for a bag for any store purchase, even if it was just gum, because otherwise it would be assumed that you'd stolen it. In fact, I still insist on bags.</p>
