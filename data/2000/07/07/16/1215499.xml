        <p>There is a new kind of finagling afoot in the land of overachieving parents and their prized children. The game is as stylized as a Japanese tea ceremony but the goal is simple: handpick a child's elementary school teacher while pretending not to do so.</p>
        <p>Once, assembling a class roster was a bureaucratic routine, something parents didn't know about or figured was somebody else's job. But that was before suburbanites picked communities based on the number of Advanced Placement classes, spent more on SAT tutors than on college tuition and planned a child's summer to impress the Ivy League admissions office.</p>
        <p>Like any new game, this one has a set of rules, laid down with great precision in certain places, this community in southern Westchester County being among them. There is a window of opportunity each spring when parents are invited to write or call their elementary school principal to discuss the coming year.</p>
        <p>The contact must be made in May, before May 26 to be exact, in at least one of the four elementary schools here. The parents are encouraged to discuss ''learning styles'' and ''teaching styles.'' They are forbidden to say which teacher they want.</p>
        <p>But nobody is fooled. Mothers acknowledge writing disingenuous letters that avoid saying, ''Mr. B stinks so give me Mr. A,'' even though that is what they mean. The principals say that if the desired match is made, it is because parents and school professionals usually agree about what is best for the child.</p>
        <p>The results of all this conniving will be seen in official notification letters later this month, when parents are told whose class their child will be in.</p>
        <p>But meanwhile, the buzz these days at a local pool and the Metro-North platform is about the merits of one teacher over another: Who is strict? Who is kind? Who is stimulating? Who is over the hill? The information is passed along the grapevine. And accurate or not, it leaves some parents with palpitations.</p>
        <p>''This gets a lot of airplay, but unreasonably so,'' said Gerard Finelli, principal of Colonial Elementary School. ''Why is it given all this attention? Isn't it a distortion? And if it gets to a certain degree, it comes back to hurt the children. But it's endemic to our society today.''</p>
        <p>A generation ago, most parents would not have dreamed of trying to influence the selection process. Linda Peters, the mother of two children at Colonial and a product of parochial schools, recalls arriving the first day and being directed to a classroom, with no ifs, ands or buts.</p>
        <p>''You showed up and they called your name,'' said Ms. Peters, who sells advertising for Glamour magazine. ''And with the nuns, you got mean, meaner or meanest.''</p>
        <p>But that was then and this is now. So Ms. Peters was not shy when she thought that her son Trevor, now entering fourth grade, had had one too many novice teachers. Mr. Finelli deferred to her and assigned the boy to a seasoned hand. It was a disaster, Ms. Peters said, and she had no one to blame but herself.</p>
        <p>''What we know about teachers is what we've heard from our friends, and it may not be a reality,'' she said. ''I don't think parents should have a say.''</p>
        <p>But parents who have not been burned by their own intervention either meddle, consider meddling or worry about not meddling. One Pelham mother -- and according to the principal, all of the lobbyists have been mothers -- is already plotting ways to get the teacher she wants for the 2001-02 school year.</p>
        <p>And the parents who do not know the rules of the game -- some schools publish them in their handbooks while others do not -- are furious when they discover that they have been bested by somebody else.</p>
        <p>''It's a mysterious process, like Kabuki theater,'' said one mother, who like many others asked not to be identified, out of fear of retaliation against her children. ''It all happens behind the screen.''</p>
        <p>Take Pamela Arsove, an emergency-room doctor and mother of two, who was told at a July 4 barbecue that another parent had gotten a sneak preview of the class lists and knew what teacher her daughter was getting in fourth grade.</p>
        <p>Who could have leaked this closely held information? Dr. Arsove wondered. Why did it go to another mother and not to her? Was she at a disadvantage because she spent less time at school than the stay-at-home mothers? And how could she have slipped up and not been a proper advocate for her child?</p>
        <p>''I felt like an idiot,'' Dr. Arsove said recently, acknowledging that  the July 4 shocker had produced a migraine headache, weeks of agitation and angry telephone calls to Colonial Elementary, where Mr. Finelli said he had made a thorough inquiry and was satisfied that the class lists had not left the building.</p>
        <p>''The teacher told my husband, 'Why didn't you talk to me before?' Does that mean I should have made a request? I was afraid that would have the opposite effect, and you want to toe the company line. So I did my child a disservice and that's very disconcerting.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Arsove is one of many working mothers who are sure that they suffer for not being regulars at school. Mr. Finelli said he had heard parents express that thought, ''but it's not a perception I agree with.''</p>
        <p>But the perception, real or imagined, is a window into the gulf between mothers who stand sentry in the playground and supervise field trips and those who leave for work at dawn and do not return until dark. And a handy place for an anxious mother to see conspiracy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Peters worries that she sees the principal only ''when I have a bone to pick,'' not an ideal way to form a trusting relationship. And Dr. Arsove wonders how she can compete with another mother who has had lunch with the school psychologist.</p>
        <p>Diane Allen, a former accountant and now a stay-at-home mother, is saddened to hear that others feel that way, but she sees their point.</p>
        <p>She runs a publishing center at Colonial, where children produce books of their own writings, and is thus in the building virtually every day. That means easy chitchat with the teachers, a first-name relationship with Mr. Finelli, knowledge of who pulls the levers of power and a sense of humor about the process that the working mothers envy.</p>
        <p>''You can't bother the principal with every nickel-and-dime issue,'' Ms. Allen said. ''But the school secretary -- she's the key.''</p>
