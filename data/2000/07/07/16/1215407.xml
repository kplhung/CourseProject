        <p>SHE came here from Nigeria with her little daughter three years ago, hoping for a reunion and a fresh start with the man she had married in a traditional Yoruba ceremony at home. But life had plans other than happiness for Mosunmola Adamolekun.</p>
        <p>The story, Ms. Adamolekun and her Legal Aid lawyers say, began in Nigeria in 1990 when Ms. Adamolekun, now 38, was married. Her husband then left Nigeria and came to the United States and became a</p>
        <p>permanent resident. She came here expecting that she would become a citizen.</p>
        <p>But when she arrived, her husband told her that he had decided to forsake their Nigerian vows and remarry. A reconciliation attempt ended in a fight, she said. Ms. Adamolekun left with her daughter, Ruby, now 7, and found work as a home health aide.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Adamolekun's story starts out like that of any hard-luck immigrant, her problems soon became much worse than being adrift in a strange country. Her tale brings into sharp relief the complaints by advocates for the poor that welfare and immigration reforms have a long way to go before really weeding out the undeserving and helping the needy.</p>
        <p>In her case, Ms. Adamolekun began to suffer from severe headaches and seizures that were eventually diagnosed as a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. A malignant tumor was removed and she received radiation therapy, but the cancer left Ms. Adamolekun so weak that simple tasks like eating, reading and walking were difficult. The seizures continued.</p>
        <p>As an illegal immigrant, Ms. Adamolekun was unable to work and had no medical insurance, and she was ineligible for even bare-bones benefits that would put a roof over her head and pay for medical treatment. She was put on nine prescribed medications, but she bought them only as money from friends and charities and the kindness of medical professionals allowed. A group called Cancer Care steered her to a Legal Aid Office last December.</p>
        <p>Then, Ms. Adamolekun's lot became similar, if not darker in its particulars, to that of hundreds of other immigrants who are able to stay in the country under a status called Permanently Residing Under Color of Law.</p>
        <p>It means simply that officials could legally deport them, but for compelling humanitarian reasons, like dire illness, they are allowed to stay. Many are people with AIDS who come from third world countries like Haiti, where there is no good treatment for their disease if they are sent home.</p>
        <p>The catch is that although these immigrants are probably alive because they can stay in the United States, they are ineligible for a full plate of welfare benefits. So while Ms. Adamolekun gets emergency Medicaid, for instance, she cannot get the medical treatment that she needs, which includes tests, blood work and medication.</p>
        <p>She does receive a monthly rent subsidy of $250 for a $525-a-month vermin-infested studio apartment in Flatbush, where neither the heat nor the elevator are reliable.</p>
        <p>Faced with paying the rent or buying medicine, Ms. Adamolekun said, she made the obvious choice. She has been threatened with eviction for not paying her rent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adamolekun goes to court on July 27 to fight the impending eviction. Long term, her only hope to receive medical care and decent housing is a long shot: Congress would have to pass a bill making her a citizen. It is, incidentally, the kind of ''private relief bill'' that some politicians wanted for Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Adamolekun's lawyers, the bigger point of her sad story is not just to point fingers but to realize that things do not always work as well as they could and perhaps should in a wealthy city in a wealthy nation.</p>
        <p>''Ms. Adamolekun's story highlights a problem experienced by untold numbers of people with uncertain immigration status,'' said Stephen Myers, the Legal Aid lawyer who will represent her in housing court.</p>
        <p>''There are large numbers of people unprotected by the safety net,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''We read about the deaf Mexicans who were exploited and everyone is concerned, but the reality is that hundreds if not thousands of people are living this way.''</p>
        <p>The prognosis for people like Ms. Adamolekun is not good even with the best medical care, to say nothing of those who manage to make do, said Olivia Cassin, a staff lawyer with Legal Aid's immigration law unit.</p>
        <p>''She has found wonderful people to help her,'' Ms. Cassin said. ''She has a desire to live. I couldn't sleep for nights on end when I first met her and heard her story.''</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Adamolekun, she said, ''I know I will eventually die from this sickness, but I want my last days to be good.''</p>
        <p>Good days, she said, would mean a clean, safe apartment. A bike for Ruby. Money to buy the medicine she needs. And the certainty that someone will take care of Ruby after she is left motherless in the city she now calls home.</p>
