        <p>This week La Caravelle, the three-star Manhattan restaurant, bought '99 Muga white Rioja to sell by the glass, a tipoff that the producer has fielded a winner.</p>
        <p>Bodegas Muga, in the Rioja Alta region, is one of Spain's few traditionalists still rearing its wines wholly in oak. Indeed, an agreeably woody bouquet and flavor frame this barrel-fermented composition of native viura grapes with some malvasia.</p>
        <p>Fans of barrel-fermented California chardonnay are likely to be wooed by the vanillan, almost baked-apple aroma with its hints of smoked meat, the wine's ample body and creamy texture, the almost honeyed flavor, the roundness.</p>
        <p>For optimum use, chill this bright, pale-brass-colored dry wine moderately and then, in the (alas, too often studied) manner of aficionados, keep swirling and sniffing it so that convection currents keep releasing its subtleties.</p>
        <p>If this blanco accompanies a fish course, the meat course will find a friend in '99 Borsao Red Wine, a simple, fleshy, fruity brew, which manages to be smooth and gutsy. This is a solid, consoling wine for a Tuesday night, when you walk off Metro-North washed out, not Saturday's dinner party, when A-list Burgundy takes over.</p>
        <p>Seventy-five percent garnacha (grenache) grapes give the blend a Rhone inflection; 25 percent tempranillo, its Iberian hue. Agricola de Borja in the Campo de Borja appellation in Zaragoza province, in northeastern Spain, is the producer.</p>
        <p>Wine Connection, 71 Westchester Avenue, Pound Ridge, asks $12 for Muga, $7 for Borsao. Green Lane, 741 Bedford Road, Bedford Hills, charges $11 for Muga and (a best buy) $5 for Borsao. Edras, 513 Boston Post Road, Port Chester, gets $7 for Borsao.</p>
        <p>Both wines are available to merchants at Tempranillo, the importer, in Mamaroneck.</p>
