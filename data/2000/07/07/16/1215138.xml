        <p>COMPETITIONS are proliferating in the art world these days. The downside is that viewers often feel bombarded by styles, techniques and images new to them, but a definite upside is that competitions make a lot of art visible that would never be discovered or be seen by a wide audience.</p>
        <p>A new entry in the world of regional competitions is ''Paper Works,'' sponsored by the Connecticut Graphic Arts Center in Norwalk. Harry Philbrick, director of the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, selected the show as well as three winners who will be featured in a show next year. All kinds of the usual and the unusual in printmaking are represented, but the contest rules went beyond the usual bounds by permitting papier-mache sculpture -- a flock of sheep by Mazie Cipriani -- and even photography. Since photography has its own processes and rich pedigree, the fact that most photographs are on paper seems beside the point. One can protest too much: only a few photographs were chosen; even so, they seem a bit like interlopers.</p>

        <p>COMPETITIONS are proliferating in the art world these days. The downside is that viewers often feel bombarded by styles, techniques and images new to them, but a definite upside is that competitions make a lot of art visible that would never be discovered or be seen by a wide audience.</p>
        <p>A new entry in the world of regional competitions is ''Paper Works,'' sponsored by the Connecticut Graphic Arts Center in Norwalk. Harry Philbrick, director of the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield, selected the show as well as three winners who will be featured in a show next year. All kinds of the usual and the unusual in printmaking are represented, but the contest rules went beyond the usual bounds by permitting papier-mache sculpture -- a flock of sheep by Mazie Cipriani -- and even photography. Since photography has its own processes and rich pedigree, the fact that most photographs are on paper seems beside the point. One can protest too much: only a few photographs were chosen; even so, they seem a bit like interlopers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick chose a photographer, Susan Hockaday, as one of the winners, and the abstract patterning characterizing her large works is related to the images seemingly derived from Asian script on the intaglio prints of Kumi Korf, another winner. And line is also the stock in trade of the third winner, Thomas Stavovy, as embodied in the title of his etching, ''Ariadne's Thread.'' Betsy Crane's monotype features a meandering ink line, and one understands why it is titled ''Homage to Klee.'' The Swiss artist enriched the world's vocabulary of fanciful line. A photograph of a crumpled paper bag, by Dan Lenore, is hung above Ms. Crane's piece, and visually works to reinforce its convoluted line. Some other entries seem to owe debts to Klee: ''Ancient Inquiries,'' by Maureen Renahan Krinsley, and ''CC24,'' by Marty Epp.</p>
        <p>Many printmakers these days employ a variety of techniques in a single work. A triptych by Roberta Hill, ''Range of Motion,'' is a good example; it features collage that gives nuanced but definite emphasis to the elements that stand out just a little bit. Adrienne Coollum's collage is a prize piece of ingenuity: she made several engravings of different varieties of scribbled black line, cut them into puzzle-like pieces and assembled them for ''Chinese Landscape.'' The parts differ only subtly but, as with Ms. Hill's work, the creation of a new surface (which is the point of collage) gives ''Chinese Landscape'' a vitality it would not otherwise have.</p>
        <p>Collage, because of its foray into three-dimensionality, might be considered a step on the way to sculpture -- but the show isn't lacking in full-blown paper sculpture.</p>
        <p>In addition to Ms. Cipriani's sheep, there is a fetching handmade paper boat by Jeanine Esposito. It is a metaphorical vessel, one surmises, for it contains thorns and is titled ''Emergence.''</p>
        <p>Charlotte Hedlund's contribution, ''Construct Deconstruct Reconstruct,'' is listed as an ''altered book.'' Perhaps ''radically'' should have preceded the phrase, because the text between hard covers that is in the final phase resembles a nest of paper slips from fortune cookies.</p>
        <p>In a sense, most of the work is radical, at least relatively so. There seems to be a dual tug in printmaking: a restless urge to experiment and innovate as well as to uphold and continue tradition.</p>
        <p>In this competition, some of the conservative work stands out for its sense of self-possession. David Brubecker's etching of the opera house in East Haddam has a sense of loneliness worthy of Edward Hopper. Likewise ''Violinists,'' by Andy Hoogenboom, has a classical look appropriate to the music his musicians are probably playing, while ''The Chefs,'' by Helen Frank, betrays an interest in daily occupations, and, aptly, has the look of a Daumier.</p>
        <p>Ultimately though, this is an exhibition that allows viewers to pick out their own favorites without worrying about larger issues. Many fetching pieces defy being classified as part of a trend. Among them is the sheer zany humor of the man with a frying pan and eggs on his head, Sharon Kurland's ''He Neglects His Medication,'' and the sly social commentary of Paul Harvey's ''Quarter Acre'' with its levitating plot of land.</p>
        <p>Some works encourage reverie. ''Alchemy,'' by Catherine Bebout, seems to be about several kinds of transformation. But a large figure with his back to us, scribbled all over with Chinese writing and certain internal organs emphasized, seems to announce that the main instrument of change, according to Ms. Bebout, is acupuncture. This is more than a chart. The ground color of this etching is a rich jade green, an ennobling color associated with the East. The work, however, also includes a skull.</p>
        <p>Other potentially transporting works include the small etching by Monika Anthony, ''Open Gate.'' All that's necessary to instill optimism in the viewer is that simple image rendered succinctly. In the same mood, but larger and in festive color, is ''Philosophers,'' by Ronald Glassman. This is indeed a merry band. It's like a ''Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' but with many participants and seen from the air.</p>
        <p>''Torch,'' by Nomi Silverman, has an opposite mood. Like ''The Philosophers,'' this work might also have French antecedents, the many incarnations of liberty as a woman. If so this fierce figure is liberty with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>''Paper Works'' is at Connecticut Graphic Arts Center in Norwalk through Aug. 19.</p>
