        <p>THE CHIEF: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, by David Nasaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) An absorbing, scholarly biography showing Hearst as a larger, more talented, more generous and less dangerous figure than looms (with the help of ''Citizen Kane'') in legend.</p>
        <p>FLUDD, by Hilary Mantel. (Owl/Holt, paper, $13.) First published in Britain in 1989, this novel of clerical life, suitably adjusted to modern times, concerns a Roman Catholic parish in a grim industrial town where things are so far gone that supernatural intervention is no surprise; the intervener, however, is no angel.</p>
        <p>FREUD'S ''MEGALOMANIA,'' by Israel Rosenfield. (Norton, $21.95.) The author provides a fictional past and a fictional last book for Freud in this wonderfully contrived novel that evokes Freud's ambition as well as his self-deception.</p>
