        <p>George Feinn letter on July 11 article holds Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens has history of hitting batters and Mets have right to complain about catcher Mike Piazza's injury</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Winning the World Series of three of the past four years gives the Yankees and their insolent owner their share of the bragging rights (''Steinbrenner Says Met Outcry Takes Focus Off Their Losing,'' July 11). But to suggest that the Mets are only upset about the beaning of their star player because they ''got their fannies handed to them'' (for the record, the champions won their three games by a combined five runs) is absurd.</p>
        <p>Clemens has a history of hitting batters who had had success against him. Piazza is just the latest. Win or lose, the Mets have every right to complain.</p>
