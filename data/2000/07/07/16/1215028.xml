        <p>BLACK MASS</p>
        <p>The Irish Mob, the FBI, and a Devil's Deal.</p>
        <p>By Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 381 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>PublicAffairs. $26.</p>
        <p>From Judas Iscariot to Linda Tripp, there have been few figures more reviled than the double-crossing informer. Jews recite a daily prayer imploring God to deny informers any hope of redemption in the world to come. Among the Irish, there is no lower form of life. Sean O'Callaghan, who informed against the I.R.A., wrote that he had been brought up to believe that it would be ''better by far to be a rapist, a murderer, anything but an informer.'' I experienced this attitude at close range while interviewing a potential client in a prison lockup. The inmate calmly admitted that he had murdered and maimed during his long criminal career, but when I asked him if he had ever been an informer, he leapt across the table and tried to attack me.</p>
        <p>There is, however, another side to the stool pigeon. Without the information and testimony provided by such double-dealers, the Justice Department might not have been able to break the Ku Klux Klan during the 1960's, prosecute the Mafia during the 1980's or prevent acts of international terrorism during the 1990's. The informer may be a high-level criminal and a traitor to his friends, but he is also an essential tool of law enforcement and crime prevention when properly used.</p>
        <p>''Black Mass'' is a revealing account of the use and misuse of two particularly notorious informers by the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, the two Boston Globe reporters who broke the story, it is at once a uniquely Boston tale about Italian-Irish rivalries in organized crime, law enforcement and politics, and a parable of what happens when law enforcement officers get too close to their informers. It is a story that the F.B.I. almost succeeded in suppressing. But thanks to a self-serving leak by one of the agents designed to get his informer killed and a courageous federal judge who held hearings on the sordid relationship between a group of Boston F.B.I. agents and their star informers, the public has gained vicarious access to the secret world of agents and their sources.</p>
        <p>The informers at the center of ''Black Mass'' are among the most heinous criminals in modern Massachusetts history. James (Whitey) Bulger, who was the head of the Irish mob in South Boston, had a history of contract killing, rape, armed robbery, extortion, drug dealing and loan sharking. His partner in crime, Stevie Flemmi, known as the Rifleman, boasted a comparably appalling criminal record. One of Bulger's boyhood acquaintances was an F.B.I. agent named John Connolly, who in the 1970's struck a devil's deal with the two crooks; in exchange for information about the Italian mob, these crime lords were given a license to commit any crime ''short of murder,'' including extortion, assault, drug dealing and loan sharking. Before long, the deal was implicitly amended to include murder so long as the right person was murdered. When Connolly and his F.B.I. colleague John Morris learned that another hoodlum was informing against Bulger and Flemmi, they tipped them off, even though doing so would imperil the informer. After the agents refused to place the informer they had endangered in the witness protection program, he was murdered on a South Boston street.</p>
        <p>Although Connolly and Morris knew that Bulger and Flemmi were responsible for the murder, they maintained a close relationship with them for over two decades. The agents alerted them to other investigations, to wiretaps and to impending indictments. In exchange, Bulger and Flemmi provided their F.B.I. friends with useful information on the Italian Mafia, and facilitated the bugging of a Mafia induction ceremony.</p>
        <p>Lehr and O'Neill ask the obvious question: was the information obtained from these informers worth the cost of protecting the mobsters in a way that for all practical purposes had given them a license to kill? But a more fundamental question was posed by Mark L. Wolf, the courageous federal district court judge who conducted the hearing that was so strongly resisted by the F.B.I. In his long opinion, which serves as an important source for this book, Wolf implicitly asked whether individual F.B.I. agents should be making the delicate and difficult policy decision of how much criminality should be tolerated in exchanges with informers.</p>
        <p>The practice at the time of this case was for individual F.B.I. agents to make their own deals with informers, without seeking approval from higher-ups. Justice Department guidelines sanctimoniously advised against allowing informers to commit heinous crimes, but these were routinely ignored. When Justice Department lawyers demanded to know the names of F.B.I. informers in order to prepare a case, agents invariably refused. William F. Weld, the former head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, was once asked what he would expect to be told by an F.B.I. agent from whom he demanded the identity of an informer. He replied, ''Go pound sand.''</p>
        <p>A s long as F.B.I. agents can tell Justice Department prosecutors to ''go pound sand'' when asked about informers, the problems exposed by the Bulger-Flemmi case will persist. The F.B.I. agents developed so fierce a loyalty to their informers that, in the words of Judge Wolf, ''they treated Bulger and Flemmi as colleagues rather than informants.'' Eventually, Morris accepted at least $7,000 in bribes from Bulger. At this point, the informer owned the agent. But Morris figured out a way of making sure that Bulger could never testify against him: he told a reporter that Bulger was an informer, hoping such a leak would prompt a hit on Bulger. But Bulger managed to escape both the Mafia hit men and the Justice Department indictment. He did so with the help of his boyhood friend Connolly, who later expressed the hope that Bulger -- who is now on the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted List -- would never be caught.</p>
        <p>This hope was apparently shared by many in the Boston office of the F.B.I., which made only a halfhearted effort to locate this high-profile fugitive with the big mouth and so much dirt on the F.B.I. Morris was recently given immunity so that he can testify against Connolly, who has been indicted. But these two bad agents are only the tip of a very deep iceberg of corruption, caused by the Justice Department's failure to monitor the relationship between agents and their informants. ''Black Mass'' should prompt a re-evaluation of the uses and misuses of informers by law enforcement officials throughout the country.</p>
