        <p>The Palace of Westminster will be open for public tours for the first time while Parliament is in recess, from Aug. 7 to Sept. 16. Until now visitors have been allowed only when Parliament has been in session, and have been confined to the public gallery unless special access was arranged through a member of Parliament or a foreign embassy.</p>
        <p>The palace, also known as the Houses of Parliament, opened in 1852 after the previous Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834. A 75-minute guided tour will pass through the chambers of the House of Commons and the House of Lords; the room where the queen dons her robes for the opening of Parliament;  the Prince's Chamber, which reflects the taste of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, chairman of the commission responsible for the design of the building; and other sections.</p>

        <p>The Palace of Westminster will be open for public tours for the first time while Parliament is in recess, from Aug. 7 to Sept. 16. Until now visitors have been allowed only when Parliament has been in session, and have been confined to the public gallery unless special access was arranged through a member of Parliament or a foreign embassy.</p>
        <p>The palace, also known as the Houses of Parliament, opened in 1852 after the previous Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire in 1834. A 75-minute guided tour will pass through the chambers of the House of Commons and the House of Lords; the room where the queen dons her robes for the opening of Parliament;  the Prince's Chamber, which reflects the taste of Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, chairman of the commission responsible for the design of the building; and other sections.</p>
        <p>Visitors will learn about the history of Parliament back to the 12th century and the roles of the Houses of Parliament. Arcane rituals -- like the role of Black Rod, Gentleman Usher and Sergeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for the security of the House of Lords, and plays a prominent part in the annual state opening of Parliament -- will be explained. Tour members will see the two dispatch boxes from where the prime minister and the leader of the opposition party address the house and battle out their differences. A highlight is the throne in the House of Lords where the monarch sits at the state opening of a new session of Parliament.</p>
        <p>Also on view will be an exhibition in Westminster Hall, ''Voters of the Future,'' showing the history of parliamentary democracy and the functions of the two Houses of Parliament.</p>
        <p>Tours start at 9:30 a.m., with the last one at 4:15 p.m. from Monday to Saturday, except on public holidays. They will cost $5.25 and must be booked through Ticketmaster at (44-207) 344-9966. Tickets are available up to five days before a visit, and cannot be bought on the day of the tour.</p>

        <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY  Correction:  August 6, 2000, Sunday  A report in the Travel Advisory column on July 16 about public tours of Westminster Palace in London included an incomplete account of their history supplied by a spokesman for Parliament. The palace, which houses Parliament, has indeed been open for public tours before while Parliament was in recess. From 1974 to 1979, they took place on Saturdays year round. Those beginning tomorrow are the first daily ones open to the public.</p>
