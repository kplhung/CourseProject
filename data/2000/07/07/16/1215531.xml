        <p>It was a familiar scenario for Gallo Blue Chip and Tyberwood, crowded together near the halfway point of the Meadowlands Pace. The two had forged a strange and uncomfortable rivalry this season, mired with controversial tactics.</p>
        <p>In a flurry of action, Tyberwood nudged toward the rail, this time crowding another horse, Aces N' Sevens, and sending Ain't No Stpn Him jerking backward through a crowd of horses. But unlike earlier meetings between Gallo Blue Chip and Tyberwood, when the activity caused problems for Gallo Blue Chip, this time the driver Daniel Dube guided the 3-year-old gelding around the jam and into the lead. Tyberwood was disqualified for causing multiple interference, and once Gallo Blue Chip took the lead, there was no heading him as he won the $1.15 million Meadowlands Pace in 1:504 5 .</p>
        <p>The inquiry sign went up as the Gallo Blue Chip family began to celebrate, but there was no question about the winner. Gallo Blue Chip beat Astreos by 3 1/4 lengths, and High on Emotion placed third.</p>
        <p>Gallo Blue Chip won $575,000, pushing his career earnings to $1,418,811.</p>
        <p>''I was frightened very much coming to the half,'' said Martin Scharf, Gallo Blue Chip's owner. ''When he cleared the lead I knew he was going to win. When he's on top, nobody can catch him.''</p>
        <p>Gallo Blue Chip entered the race as the favorite, having won the North American Cup in 1:501 5 , the second-fastest time in Cup history. He started the season slowly but has improved under the guidance of Mark Ford, 29, who became the youngest trainer to win two million-dollar races.</p>
        <p>The race contained an intriguing sidelight: the rivalry between Gallo Blue Chip and Tyberwood. Three times this year they found themselves close together on the track, and the first two times, Tyberwood's driver, Richie Silverman, let his whip stray back, frightening the head-shy Gallo Blue Chip. Then, in the third meeting, Tyberwood bumped Gallo Blue Chip and was disqualified for the action.</p>
        <p>When asked tonight about Tyberwood's actions on the backstretch, Ford said: ''Ridiculous. I don't want to say something I shouldn't say.''</p>
        <p>This time, Gallo Blue Chip had little trouble after a rocky start. Gallo Blue Chip was forced to go wide around the first turn from the No. 9 post, taking the lead at the half in 534 5  and building on the lead, taking a 4-length advantage into the homestretch. With Dube prodding him, he was never challenged.</p>
        <p>''I'm just so relieved it's over with,'' Ford said. ''It's been such a long week. I tell you what, he's really been more than I ever thought he was. This doesn't come along very often. As they came around the turn, I was thinking, 'That's a long, long stretch.' I just thought, 'Please hold on,' and he kept going.''</p>
        <p>In the Classic Series Final, Big Tom captured the $275,000 purse in a record time, pacing the mile and a sixteenth in 1:571 5 , breaking the record of 1:572 5  set in 1997 by Red Bow Tie, who finished seventh in the race.</p>
