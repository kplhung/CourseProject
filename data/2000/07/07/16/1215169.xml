        <p>To the Editor: W. D. Wetherell's essay ''Discovering America, in 50 Steps'' (June 4) was absolutely on the mark.</p>
        <p>I, too, have always wanted to visit each of the 50 states and have done pretty well so far, having been to 46. My count also includes two ''airport only'' visits: Iowa and Michigan. I have also been guilty of ''darting over the border,'' specifically the Kansas border, which is adjacent to Interstate 44 as the highway crosses from Missouri into Oklahoma.</p>

        <p>For several years, I've been trying to come up with a good reason to plan a vacation in the north central part of the country, which would allow me to cross North Dakota off my list as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin,  leaving just Alaska. In my view, there couldn't be a better reason for an Alaskan cruise.</p>
