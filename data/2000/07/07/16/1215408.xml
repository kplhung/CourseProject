        <p>EVERY time I wait to download a song or retrieve a video clip of my new niece (I'm a first-time uncle), I blame my landlord. These digital dumps take much longer than they should because, despite the fiber buried under the street where I live, the high-bandwidth highway doesn't stop at my prewar apartment house. My landlord has blocked the cable company from entering the building in order to upgrade its wiring, which is essential to completing an on-ramp.</p>
        <p>Since the computer at my office uptown is connected to a high-speed T-1 line, I sorely know what I'm missing. At the office it takes one minute to do what takes 30 for my modem at home.</p>
        <p>My landlord's manager (my landlord won't talk to me) tells me to mind my own business. She says the owner wants to be paid for access. That includes a piece of the monthly fees, too. He's looking for a deal to cover all his buildings. Except for mine in Manhattan, the others are in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''Brooklyn!'' I blurt out. ''Who knows when those streets will be wired?''</p>
        <p>''Tough luck,'' she says. This woman hasn't heard about Internet time.</p>
        <p>I print up a leaflet signed ''A concerned tenant'' and put copies under my neighbors' doors. ''I'm outraged,'' I write, and ''you should be, too. It costs the landlord nothing to upgrade our building's aging cable system and tenants nothing to receive the upgrade. Cable modem service is optional.'' I can't believe I'm soliciting for Road Runner, Time-Warner's Internet service. I don't mention that those who want Road Runner are looking at $40 a month on top of their already hefty cable TV bills. For TV alone, I'm now paying $51, which includes HBO, a premium channel.</p>
        <p>Still, that $40 is about the cheapest high-speed Internet access you can get.</p>
        <p>I'm irked that the city's tenants' laws have failed to keep up with this  21st-century issue -- the inalienable right to high-speed bandwidth. Why should a landlord, who doesn't live in the building, have the right to block tenants' speedy access to the Internet any more than he can stand in the way of our getting electricity or  heat? This is a quality-of-life issue.</p>
        <p>I call Time-Warner Cable. Many times. I get a scripted reply that when the upgrade is available, residents will be contacted. Finally, I get a salesman in the real estate department who has actually been talking to my landlord.</p>
        <p>Fiber has been on the block for more than a year, he says. ''We're still negotiating,'' he adds.</p>
        <p>I call Time-Warner Cable's legal department to find out why the company hasn't sued my landlord to gain access. I envision Chairman Gerald Levin waving a court order as the police storm the bastions of my Luddite landlord, a crew of cable pullers bringing up the rear. Foolish me. ''We have to deal with him in the future,'' says the assistant in Legal.</p>
        <p>I contact the city's Telecommunications and Cable Franchise office.  Counsel Richard Berkley e-mails me that a state public service law does indeed provide the cable company with a right to install franchise facilities in a landlord's building. ''That right, however, is up to the cable company to enforce,'' he adds.</p>
        <p>I draft a petition to the landlord: ''We, the undersigned residents, request that installers be allowed to upgrade the building's cable system so that we can be connected to the new fiber-optic cable buried on our street that is available to our neighbors.'' I deliver it to the landlord's manager on a cold day in February.</p>
        <p>Despite a sentence in the petition asking the landlord to ''show good will toward your tenants while at the same time increasing the value of the building's infrastructure in the digital age'' two weeks go by with no response. When I call, she says the landlord hasn't gotten back to her.</p>
        <p>I call the next month. The manager is belligerent. She's tired of the  phone calls from tenants about this. ''It's his property, and he'll do what he wants,'' she says.</p>
        <p>''He's breaking the law,'' I say.</p>
        <p>''Goodbye,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Eight months have passed since I began my quest for cable modem service. When I talked to the cable company's legal department last week, I was told the company was planning to send a ''notice of intent'' to perform the upgrade if continued negotiations with the landlord's attorney failed. No they didn't know the date their crews would try to enter the building. Meanwhile, I can almost hear the bits buzzing by at lightning speed just under the pavement outside. I'm still drumming my fingers beside my home computer, waiting for the newest pictures of my niece to download.</p>
