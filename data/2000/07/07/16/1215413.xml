        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Accident Kills Kosovo Boy'' (news item, July 11):</p>
        <p>With a modern military weapon, a truly accidental single discharge is highly unlikely. The chance of an accidental three-round burst is astronomically small. The death of the 5-year-old Kosovo boy was not caused by an ''accident,'' but by negligence on the part of a person handling a powerful firearm.</p>
        <p>There are four basic rules of gun safety: Treat all guns as loaded; never point a gun at something you are unwilling to destroy (or always point your weapon in a safe direction); keep your finger off the trigger (and out of the trigger guard) until you are ready to shoot; and be aware of your target and what lies beyond.</p>

        <p>In this case, the first three of these rules were definitely not followed.</p>
