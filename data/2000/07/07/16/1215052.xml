        <p>Pure</p>
        <p>By Rebbecca Ray.</p>
        <p>Grove, paper, $13.</p>
        <p>Rebbecca Ray began writing her first novel, a coming-of-age story called ''Pure,'' when she was was 16 and coming of age herself. (She is now all of 20.) It shows. In one sense, Ray's words are revelatory, since she is not viewing youth with hindsight or imbuing it with nostalgia. But, like the banter of an adolescent, the book feels uncensored and wholly self-indulgent. ''Pure'' is the story of a 14-year-old British girl who is distancing herself from her family and finding herself through men. ''I was about 13 when I started letting the boys feel me up,'' is how the story begins, and the play-by-play continues from there, with similarly matter-of-fact -- and often cringe-inducing -- descriptions of sex sprinkled throughout the book. The sex is often boring and painful, but even more painful is the fact that the nameless narrator enjoys it -- at least someone is paying attention to her. ''I sort of liked him hating me,'' she says of her first boyfriend. ''I knew exactly where I stood: right at his feet.'' Such self-loathing, palpable on every page, makes it possible for the protagonist to be abused, even to cut herself, and yet revel in the pain. We also witness her increasingly discordant home life, with a father who is bitter because his daughter is growing away from him and a mother who is emotionally frozen. Add to that a cloying best friend and a relationship with a man 13 years her senior, and you have more angst than Judy Blume would know what to do with. Ray writes with such immediacy and bluntness that reading ''Pure'' is like receiving dispatches from the front lines of young womanhood. But like war reporting, it is not always easy to read.</p>
