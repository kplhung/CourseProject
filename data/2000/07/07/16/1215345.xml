        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am compelled to respond to ''Coping With Luxury Fever'' (Soapbox, June 25). Never before have I seen such an array of trucks (yes, they are small trucks) clogging the local roads and highways of Westchester County. Why do people feel they must be a head above other drivers or in a bigger vehicle to feel safe? And why must they selfishly drive at a snail's pace when we are behind them or at a racer's demonic speed when we are in front of them?</p>

        <p>To all those selfish people who drive S.U.V.'s and think they own the road: one day the Department of Motor Vehicles will require you to take a separate road test before you purchase your small truck. Until then I shall stay clear of you road warriors since you obviously cannot handle your vehicles.</p>
