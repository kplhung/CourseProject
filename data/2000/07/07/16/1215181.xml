        <p>AT the Jewish Family Congregation here, they call it the tiny Torah, and indeed the scroll stands perhaps a foot tall, dwarfed by its two larger companions in the temple's ark. But there's a big story behind it.</p>
        <p>The tiny parchment scroll came wrapped in a Russian prison uniform, and wrapped in mystery. Where the story begins is not known, but Jerusalem in 1977 is the starting point so far as the congregation here is concerned.</p>
        <p>''My wife and I were in Jerusalem, and we met a wonderful young silversmith,'' Edward Mendell, a former Westchester resident, said by phone from England recently. ''He produced Judaica in the medieval and ancient style, modern renderings of antiquities. He had produced a pair of remonim, ornamental handle covers for a Torah, and a yad, a stylized pointer for reading it, plus a breastplate, all in silver and gold. They were beautiful, but about half size for a full Torah. I said: 'If you ever find a Torah to fit the ornaments, let me know.' ''</p>
        <p>Four years later, the Mendells received a call in their South Salem home. It was the silversmith. ''A newly arrived Russian emigre just came into my shop,'' he told Mr. Mendell, ''and wrapped in prison clothing he has a half-size Torah, which the ornaments fit perfectly!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mendell said: ''I had the Torah authenticated and was told that not only was it perfectly legitimate but also beautifully done, and that it was very old. The price was prohibitive, but I'm compulsive, so I bought it.''</p>
        <p>How was the scroll smuggled out of the Soviet Union? Was its transporter actually a former prisoner? Was he Jewish?</p>
        <p>''Questions, but no answers,'' said Mr. Mendell, a retired manufacturer of pharmaceutical raw materials and now an author writing about tribal customs.</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Renee, became one of three founding families of the Jewish Family Congregation within months of acquiring the tiny Torah. ''Since our congregation did not yet own a Torah, I would lend my little one for services every Friday night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Later Mr. Mendell helped the congregation buy its own Torah, one from Czechoslovakia that had survived the Holocaust, and his miniature became a permanent fixture in his home. But early in 1999, when he and his English-born wife moved to England full time, they donated the Torah to the reform congregation. ''My wife and I decided we wanted it to be part of the heritage of the J.F.C.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like all Torah scrolls, the tiny one contains the complete five books of Moses, written in Hebrew.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Carla Freedman said of the little Torah: ''We use it occasionally. The lettering is very beautiful and somewhat faint and very tiny. Even I have trouble following it at times.</p>
        <p>''And it is very old. Our Czech scroll is from 1838, and someone who examined both said the tiny Torah is older.''</p>
        <p>Just as it itself was liberated, it has been liberating.</p>
        <p>''Torahs are very heavy,'' Rabbi Freedman said. ''When one is brought into the congregation during a service, generally only a man can carry it. But this scroll was clearly created for portability, and it gives women in the congregation a chance to raise the Torah.''</p>
        <p>And children. ''I carried it with my mom when I was 8,'' Zac Waldman, now 10, remembered. ''It was a pretty great feeling. I know it survived World War II.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Freedman said: ''At the end of the High Holy Days, there is a Simchat Torah celebration -- this year it is Oct. 27. All the scrolls are carried around and danced with in temple. With the tiny Torah, even children can join in.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Freedman supplies the overview. ''After being hidden who knows where for who knows how long,'' she said, ''the tiny Torah has ended up loved and revered.''</p>
