        <p>NATURE has long been a wondrous and captivating subject for both the American artist and the public. In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed: ''The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and the vegetable. They nod to me, and I to them.''</p>
        <p>For almost 30 years, Paul Stankard of Mantua has created floral paperweights and botanical sculptures that are reverential tributes to nature's beauty. His masterly ability to render native wildflowers in glass has earned him an international reputation. ''Recreating Flowers'' is a retrospective exhibition that celebrates the career of a major figure in the contemporary studio glass movement and one of New Jersey's most renowned artists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stankard has always been deeply inspired by the flora of the Pine Barrens, especially some of the region's rarest and most endangered species. The Noyes Museum and the artist perfectly complement one another. On several occasions in the 1980's, Fred Noyes, the museum's co-founder, and Mr. Stankard had explored together the adjacent Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, following a five-mile loop that extends into the tidal water. It is especially appropriate that this retrospective exhibit is taking place at South Jersey's only art museum, with its picturesque setting. In the fall the show will be traveling to the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton, where it runs from Oct. 7 through Jan. 7.</p>
        <p>The real story behind this well-chosen exhibition is the relationship between a patron of more than 25 years and the artist. All 68 works, dating from 1974 to the present, come from the collection of Michael Diorio, a dentist and nature photographer from Vineland. In the early 1970's, Dr. Diorio began buying one paperweight about every two weeks. Once Dr. Diorio had purchased 17 paperweights, Reese Palley, the Atlantic City gallery dealer who was then representing Mr. Stankard, felt the artist and collector should meet.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, the two men and their families have become best friends; they live only 28 miles from each other. After all these years, Dr. Diorio said, ''I still get a rush when I see one of his new sculptures; I cannot wait to get my next piece.'' Mr. Stankard appreciates his friend's criticism, recognizing that Dr. Diorio ''knows the nuances and is very knowledgeable about the work.''</p>
        <p>Several quotes by Walt Whitman, who has been an ongoing inspiration for Mr. Stankard, have been placed like a cornice molding around the gallery. One says, ''A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.''</p>
        <p>With the older works displayed on the left and the more recent pieces on the right of the gallery, it is fascinating to observe how the artist has evolved. The earlier, intimately sized paperweights, like ''Flax on Green Ground,'' which established his career, seem more restrained.</p>
        <p>In contrast, ''Mountain Laurel Diptych Botanical'' is not only larger in scale but also considerably more complex in composition and execution. To best observe this kind of sculptural form requires viewing from all sides, not just from the top, as with a typical paperweight. Although Mr. Stankard regards the mountain laurel as ''the most beautiful flower of North America,'' he did not attempt to represent this intricate blossom until the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>The components of each flower are individually made and then assembled; it is a truly ambitious procedure. In addition to the floral subjects, several earth spirits are also positioned on very realistic looking sandy soil. Since glass is primarily made from silica, there is a witty irony at work here.</p>
        <p>Manipulating the flame of a gas burner to melt colored pieces of glass, Mr. Stankard uses the process to create floral subjects of exquisite refinement. But his flowers are not botanical portraits, instead more referential images. Nonetheless, visitors to the exhibition were overheard wondering how the artist put real flowers inside the clear crystal glass. The details of the fruit and bees in ''Hive Bouquet With Black-eyed Susans and Blueberries'' are truly astonishing, yet the honeycomb is illogically positioned as a suspended object. Bring a magnifying glass; it will then be possible to see a word like ''seeds'' on the tendril located at the bottom.</p>
        <p>Ullysses Grant Dietz, curator of decorative arts at the Newark Museum, wrote a short essay to accompany the exhibition. Mr. Dietz summarized Mr. Stankard's career by stating: ''Paul is the greatest living master of the paperweight maker's art in the world. He has achieved a rare thing: personal and artistic integrity. What greater joy in life than to be able to say that?''</p>
        <p>A visitor recognized this very sentiment and commented in the gallery book that the show ''reflects not only the talent but also the inner beauty of the artist.''</p>
