        <p>THE phrase ''Communist musical comedy'' may sound like an oxymoron, but even the officially achieved utopia of no-longer-extant East Germany required a few measures of utopian song-and-dance.</p>
        <p>''Hot Summer,'' the teenage musical that was the D.D.R.'s second-highest-grossing film in 1968, is not quite socialism a-go-go but it's an entertaining artifact nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Like most movies produced in East Germany, ''Hot Summer'' (Icestorm International, 91 minutes, German with English subtitles) is virtually unknown here -- although the strident, vaguely martial title song, staged amid the scrubbed streets of downtown Karl-Marx-Stadt, was excerpted in ''East Side Story,'' the sardonic 1997 documentary about Communist musicals by the independent filmmakers Dana Ranga and Andrew Horn.</p>
        <p>Directed in wide-screen and pastel colors by the former cameraman Joachim Hasler, ''Hot Summer'' is a collectivist romantic fling. A group of 10 hitchhiking high school girls compete with a comparable band of high school boys to see who can arrive first at their vacation spot on the Baltic coast. The contest continues, amid much cavorting on the beach, after they arrive: the boys play a series of pranks (releasing mice in the girls' dorm); the girls respond with taunting songs (''They think they're such big guys but really they're babies in disguise'').</p>
        <p>Produced as part of a new emphasis on genre entertainments that followed a ban of 11 mildly critical films, ''Hot Summer'' was not the first East German musical, but it was the first youth musical. Two of the stars, Frank Schobel and Chris Doerk, were a popular singing duo. Although labeled the ''East German 'Grease' '' by its American distributors, ''Hot Summer'' is closer at heart to the teenage drive-in fare produced by American International Pictures. (The oompah beat and regimented choruses also recall ''The Sound of Music'' -- albeit with discreetly honking saxophones and twanging guitars.)</p>
        <p>Made at the height of the international youth movement -- the year A.I.P. switched from ''How to Stuff a Wild Bikini'' to the incendiary ''Wild in the Streets'' and Jean-Luc Godard unleashed the cannibal hippies of ''Weekend'' -- ''Hot Summer'' is relentlessly cheerful and upbeat. Authority is embodied by an understanding cop and there is barely a hint of rebellion -- some mild complaining about parents notwithstanding. The youths are further characterized by a concern for culture. Two teenagers presage a night in the hayloft with prolonged quoting of classic verse; another girl lectures her colleagues on Brecht's alienation effect. The main dramatic tension pits the individual against the group. Everybody does everything together, including shouting in unison. The crucial question: ''Are we a collective or an ordinary gang?''</p>
        <p>''Hot Summer'' is part of the ongoing series of East German films newly released by Icestorm International in association with the University of Massachusetts. The video transfer is well-produced in a letterbox format with new, thoroughly adequate English subtitles. In the post-Communist Germany, ''Hot Summer'' has become a cult film in somewhat the same spirit that East Germany's quaintly functional package designs have become collectibles and the Communist ''kinderhymnes'' of the defunct Free German Youth organization have been reissued on CD.</p>
