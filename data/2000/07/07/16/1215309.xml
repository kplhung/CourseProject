      <abstract>
        <p>Ernie Contri, whose voice is ringer for Frank Sinatra, will perform in free concert for Sinatra Park in Hoboken, NJ (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>From the mid-1980's to the early-1990's, Ernie Contri had a virtual lock on the annual Greenwich Village Perform as Your Favorite Performer contest. His forte: Frank Sinatra. He was a vocal ringer for Ol' Blue Eyes, and he won handily, beating out many a Madonna and a Doris Day. He also always brought the crowd to a fever pitch.</p>
        <p>He has continued to croon, and whether it's a Frank Sinatra tribute or an evening of standards, the man provides the goods. And how appropriate is this concert for Sinatra Park? The show, at 7 p.m. on Thursday, is part of Hoboken's Enchanted Evenings free concerts. Bring a blanket or lawn chair and enjoy the summer wind.</p>
