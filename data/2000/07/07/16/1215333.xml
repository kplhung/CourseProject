        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>I read your article with dismay, mostly because of your reticence to intervene on behalf of your daughter. Of course, with 20/ 20 hindsight, it is easy to second-guess someone else's actions. However, my vote is that it was just ''white-bread squeamishness,'' as you put it. Given your scenario, here is what I probably would have done (in order of preference):</p>
        <p>1. You state that as you got out of the car, you realized the music being played was objectionable. The first option I would have taken would have been to get back in the car and find another gas station, explaining to my daughter why we are leaving.</p>
        <p>2. If it's too late to leave, then I would gently ask the owner of the car to please turn off his music, explaining that the language is not appropriate for a 9-year-old girl to hear. Of course, this message would likely be received far differently when delivered by a mother than by a father, because I've found people are used to mothers getting bent out of shape over things that affect their children. Whether or not the person complies, you can explain to your daughter what was happening and provide her a valuable lesson: a) sometimes if really works if you ask nicely for someone to stop doing something that bothers you, or b) some people are boorish and don't care if they offend others. People like this are usually angry about something and take it out on other people, etc., etc.</p>
        <p>3. Last, but certainly not least, there is an alternative to the passive approach of ''keep your qualms to yourself and figure your daughter won't be irreparably harmed -- if she's even tuning in -- by a few minutes of syncopated filth.'' Talk to your daughter in the car as you pull away. Ask, ''Did you hear the words to that song?'' If yes, then without going into graphic detail, explain why you think those words are ''filthy,'' why it is rude to blast music in a public place, etc., etc. Even if she didn't listen to the words, you can still explain about rudeness in public and how the words of some songs are offensive, and that it is important to pay attention to what you consider entertainment.  How many opportunities like this arise for you to really teach your child your values?</p>
