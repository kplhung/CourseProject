        <p>Allan H. Dobrin, New York City's information technology and telecommunications commissioner, is eminently at home in the virtual world.</p>
        <p>He carries a Palm Pilot V, a Motorola alphanumeric pager, a wireless I.B.M. laptop, a Startac cellular telephone and a Nextel cell phone that works like a walkie-talkie.</p>
        <p>It is the real world, with boundaries both physical and bureaucratic, that sometimes gives him pause.</p>
        <p>Last week, a state judge in Albany ruled in favor of Mr. Dobrin and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying that they, and not the City Council, had the power to negotiate franchise agreements with cable television companies.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Dobrin spends much of his time in meetings, persuading city officials and dealing with matters like the court case, he says he would much rather spend his time planning new Internet services and finding space for new fiber-optic cables in Lower Manhattan's Silicon Alley.</p>
        <p>''The advent of the Internet is the opportunity of a lifetime to fundamentally change the way New York City provides services to its residents,'' Mr. Dobrin said. ''The challenge is doing it in one of the largest governments in the country, which has hundreds of different missions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin serves as the citywide technology officer, the liaison to the Silicon Alley business community  and the mayor's chief adviser on information technology. (The mayor has Internet access at his desk and uses a Palm Pilot to go online while traveling.) Mr. Dobrin's department is also responsible for the 911 system and for regulating cable television franchises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin's aides say their boss recoils from the publicity and perks other political appointees thrive on. He is among the few city commissioners with neither a press secretary nor a driver. He is rarely seen at fund-raisers or other political events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin says he has little time for such things. As only the second person to hold his position, he does not have predecessors' experience to rely on.</p>
        <p>R. Ryan Nelson, the director of the Center for Management of Information Technology at the University of Virginia, said, ''The changing nature and needs of technology in the last decade have made jobs like these, especially in complicated, large bureaucracies like New York City, very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Much of his time, Mr. Dobrin said, is spent on dealing with new legal or practical issues that arise because of advances in technology.</p>
        <p>Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said rapid changes make Mr. Dobrin's job more difficult. ''His goals are a moving target, because the life cycle in the world of the Internet is moving so quickly that last year's idea is replaced by a better structure, and you never know what type of problems you are going to face.''</p>
        <p>For example, one concern is a lack of space beneath Lower Manhattan's streets for new fiber-optic cables.</p>
        <p>''For a while, we have been hearing that when you dig into the ground, there is no more room to put anything,'' Mr. Dobrin said.</p>
        <p>Engineers working for Mr. Dobrin came up with a solution ingenious in its simplicity: using 175 miles of abandoned century-old water pipes in Manhattan and Brooklyn as conduits for the cables. Whether it will work is unclear. If it does not, Mr. Dobrin has already begun planting hints that he would like to see new high-tech companies move to a neighborhood whose innards are less dense. He hopes that more high-tech companies will go to places with lower rents, like Harlem, Long Island City and Dumbo, the area in Brooklyn under the Manhattan Bridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin started in city government in the 1980's as an administrator at the Board of Education. He moved to the mayor's office in the late 80's and is among the few political appointees who have served in the Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani administrations. He left in 1997 to become deputy executive administrator of Bellevue Hospital Center, where he became more interested in technology. But Mr. Giuliani lured him back less than a year later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin, a native of Queens, still lives there with his wife, Lynda, a public school assistant principal, and his sons, Alex, 14, and Michael, 12. He is known for spending 70 hours a week working on technology problems -- a crash of the 911 system in February 1999 and Y2K preparations among them -- and preparing the government for what he calls ''the e-government revolution.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobrin would like citizens to be able to go to one Web site to fill out and pay for all the permits needed to, say, erect a building, instead of having to visit a dozen agency offices.</p>
        <p>That, he said, would reduce the need for city clerks and thus provide more money for police officers, firefighters and teachers.</p>
        <p>Within City Hall, Mr. Dobrin's name has been mentioned for several higher positions. But he says he wants to stay in his job.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to create a reorganized virtual government, as if you started the government in 2000 instead of 1898,'' Mr. Dobrin said.</p>
