        <p>When Mr. Gates comes home from a tough day of fighting to keep Microsoft in one piece, how does he relax? Maybe by trying to put pieces back together.</p>
        <p>The pieces of a Stave Xtreme Puzzle, that is. ''They love jigsaw puzzles,'' Steve Richardson, the Stave chief executive, said of Mr. Gates and his wife, Melinda. ''They buy identical puzzles and compete to see who finishes first.''</p>
        <p>Stave Puzzles is expecting more than 200 puzzlers, though probably not the Gateses, to celebrate its 25th anniversary next weekend at an Xtreme Puzzling event in West Hartford, Vt.  But the Gateses have toured the Stave Puzzle workshop in Norwich, Vt. ''We usually have one or two Stave puzzles along on vacations,'' Mr. Gates has told Mr. Richardson, who has not shied from repeating this.</p>
        <p>Other fans include Barbara Bush, who does the puzzles with her grandchildren, and Tom Peters, the management guru.</p>
        <p>Each puzzle, costing $95 to $3,000 and made from mahogany, has pieces cut into special shapes like initials or clowns -- or palace guards, in a gift to Queen Elizabeth II from the Canadian government.</p>
