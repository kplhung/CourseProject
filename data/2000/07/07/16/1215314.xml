        <p>I'M never without olives in the kitchen. Do I need a quick nibble with cocktails? Bring out the olives. Will I want to give a new look and taste to a stew? I'll add olives. And when it comes to salads, plump, glossy olives contribute a deliciously salty tang and meaty texture.</p>
        <p>A quick tour through the olive display in many supermarkets, fancy food shops and delicatessens reveals more than a dozen green, brown and black olives, large and small, pitted and unpitted, some cracked and peppered, others stuffed. It's easy to taste and decide which you like. Olives keep for months in the refrigerator so there's no problem having them on hand.</p>

        <p>I'M never without olives in the kitchen. Do I need a quick nibble with cocktails? Bring out the olives. Will I want to give a new look and taste to a stew? I'll add olives. And when it comes to salads, plump, glossy olives contribute a deliciously salty tang and meaty texture.</p>
        <p>A quick tour through the olive display in many supermarkets, fancy food shops and delicatessens reveals more than a dozen green, brown and black olives, large and small, pitted and unpitted, some cracked and peppered, others stuffed. It's easy to taste and decide which you like. Olives keep for months in the refrigerator so there's no problem having them on hand.</p>
        <p>There are even some excellent imported olives, like kalamata and nicoise, which come in jars. Olive seasoning is also easy to add to dressings or dips, or to use as a sandwich spread, with the various olive pastes sold in jars and tubes.</p>
        <p>The only olives I avoid are the canned black, so-called ripe olives from California, which have no flavor or character. And with so many better choices now, there is no reason to buy them. Here are some summer salads, which go beyond the combination of lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, peppers and olives called Greek salad, to showcase a variety of olives.</p>
        <p>Chicken Salad With Green Olives  Total Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2cups cooked coarsely diced chicken  16pitted green olives, halved  Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon  1teaspoon ground cumin  4tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  Salt and freshly ground black  pepper to taste  2tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint leaves  1tablespoon finely chopped cilantro leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Put chicken in a bowl with olives and lemon zest.</p>
        <p>2. Beat lemon juice with cumin and oil. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over chicken and mix.</p>
        <p>3. Fold in mint and cilantro and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Fresh Tuna Salad With Tomatoes and Olives  Total Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2pounds fresh tuna  6tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  36cherry tomatoes, halved  1red onion, sliced thin and separated in rings  1cup pitted kalamata olives  2tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  1 1/2tablespoons Dijon mustard  2tablespoons red-wine vinegar  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  3tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Trim any dark spots from fish and brush fish with a tablespoon of oil. Heat heavy cast-iron skillet, grill or broiler and sear fish a few minutes on each side, until lightly browned but still very rare in the middle. Allow fish to cool, then dice in one-inch chunks. Put in a bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Fold in tomatoes, onion and olives. Beat Worcestershire sauce with mustard and vinegar. Beat in remaining oil. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over fish mixture, add parsley and toss lightly. Allow to marinate 30 minutes before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Couscous Salad With Olives and Vegetables  Total Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>3carrots, peeled and sliced  1/2-inch thick  Large pinch saffron threads  Salt</p>
        <p>3/4cup instant couscous  3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  1green bell pepper, seeded, cored and diced  1medium onion, diced  2cloves garlic, minced  1cup cooked chick peas  1cup small nicoise olives  1tablespoon white wine vinegar  1tablespoon minced fresh parsley  Freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Put carrot slices in saucepan with water to cover. Bring to simmer and cook until tender, about five minutes. Drain, reserving a cup of cooking water. Add saffron to a cup of water and season with salt. Allow to steep five minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Put couscous in bowl. Pour saffron water over, stir in two tablespoons olive oil, cover and allow to sit about 10 minutes, until liquid is absorbed.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, heat remaining oil in skillet, add green pepper, onion and garlic and saute over medium heat until just tender. Stir in carrots, chick peas and olives. Allow to cool to room temperature.</p>
        <p>4. Fold pepper mixture into couscous, fluffing as you go. Fold in vinegar and parsley. Season with salt and pepper and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
