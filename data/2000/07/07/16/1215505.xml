        <p>The first celebration for the MetroStars today came just three minutes into the game. Alex Comas, the Colombian striker, ran to the sideline and jumped into the arms of his coaches and teammates after scoring the team's fastest goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Another goal, by Petter Villegas in the 62nd minute, secured the MetroStars' 2-0 triumph over the New England Revolution this afternoon at Foxboro Stadium before a crowd of 16,838. It was the fifth consecutive victory on the road for the MetroStars, who were the worst team in Major League Soccer last season.</p>
        <p>The victory strengthened the MetroStars' hold on first place in the league's Eastern Division. It extended their unbeaten streak to eight games and improved their record to 12-7-2. They were 7-25 last season.</p>
        <p>Even though they were missing Tab Ramos and Clint Mathis, their two most effective players in recent weeks, who are with the national team in Guatemala for Sunday's World Cup qualifying game, the MetroStars played a nearly perfect road game. They refused to be intimidated and capitalized on their opportunities.</p>
        <p>Coach Octavio Zambrano said his players were aware that they had to play better because of absences and injuries, a reference to Ramos and Mathis and the injury to Lothar Matthaus.</p>
        <p>It was another physical game between the teams, which are developing a strong rivalry. They picked up where they left off in their previous meeting, a 4-2 MetroStars victory in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 17. There were 52 fouls in that game, 32 by the MetroStars, who drew three cautions today before the game was 20 minutes old.</p>
        <p>There were 40 fouls today, 24 by the MetroStars, and five cautions. Billy Walsh of the MetroStars was ejected for a violent foul on Jamar Beasley of the Revolution (7-9-5) in the 78th minute.</p>
        <p>''He was flying and he fell on his head,'' Walsh said. ''I just stepped into the play and got him with the inside of my foot.''</p>
        <p>The goal by Comas started with a long floating pass by Daniel Hernandez. The ball landed among two defenders and Comas at the top of the penalty area. Comas judged the bounce better than the others and flicked the ball with his head over goalkeeper Juergen Sommer, who hesitated coming off his line.</p>
        <p>Sommer, who made his second start of the season after two knee injuries, redeemed himself 12 minutes later, plunging to his left to stop Walsh's powerful header from close range.</p>
        <p>Villegas scored the second goal in the 62nd minute on a play he started with a move in the center of the field. Villegas kept running after giving the ball to Adolfo Valencia, who shielded the ball from two defenders and gave it back to Villegas for a shot from close range.</p>
        <p>Villegas ran over to the section of MetroStars fans in the stadium to celebrate his fourth goal of the season. About 120 fans traveled from the New York metropolitan area and celebrated the MetroStars' victory with a small parade outside Foxboro Stadium, singing and waving scarfs with the team colors.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>MetroStars General Manager NICK SAKIEWICZ said he planned to meet with LOTHAR MATTHAUS's representatives late Saturday night to discuss the player's future. Sakiewicz said Matthaus was suffering from a slipped disk and might start running next week. The MetroStars are 9-1-1 without Matthaus, and some people in the organization feel the MetroStars do not need him. Sakiewicz said last Thursday that a decision on Matthaus's future would be made by Wednesday. . . . MIKE AMMANN made his return in goal for the MetroStars after missing four games with a strained back and played with inspiration, registering the team's sixth shutout of the season.</p>
