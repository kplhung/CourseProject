        <p>POWER and passion: the Bolshoi Ballet's dancing has been synonymous with these qualities, making it a company like no other. Virtually sold out for its appearances at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 this week, as it was for its recent five-city United States tour, the fabled troupe from Moscow returns to New York for the first time in 10 years, and with its potent mystique intact.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, as Aleksei Fadeyechev says: ''It is a different company now. Each time chooses its own dancers.'' Mr. Fadeyechev, who was one of the Bolshoi stars in 1990, was made the ballet troupe's artistic director in 1998 by Vladimir Vasiliev, the superstar named to the new and double post of general and artistic director of the entire Bolshoi Theater in 1995.</p>
        <p>By ''different,'' Mr. Fadeyechev, interviewed during the tour last month in Washington, was referring to a way of dancing, not the company's vicissitudes since Yuri Grigorovich, its pre-eminent choreographer, was forced out as artistic director in a power struggle. In 1990, Mr. Grigorovich was at the helm and dancers like Mr. Fadeyechev still danced in the Bolshoi's heroic manner.</p>
        <p>This thrilling style, epitomized earlier by Mr. Vasiliev's muscular bravura, has yielded to a more contemporary and classical look, in Mr. Fadeyechev's view. The dancers are slimmer now and have been influenced by Western models.</p>
        <p>Yet Bolshoi dancing retains its dynamic imprint -- what Mr. Fadeyechev calls ''expressiveness with a spiritual springboard,'' reaching beyond technique to uplift the viewer. Traditionally the company has been more willing to break the rules of academic style than its rival in St. Petersburg, the Kirov Ballet. The latter's dancing was pure, all could agree, but the Bolshoi's was more exciting.</p>
        <p>Like most cliches, this appraisal holds true -- as Americans saw recently in two Bolshoi signature pieces, ''Don Quixote'' and Leonid Lavrovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Nonetheless there have been changes. The company has brought a generation of young dancers new to New York. Thanks to the freedom of the post-Communist era, George Balanchine's ballets, once frowned upon because they had no stories, have been added to the programming.</p>
        <p>When the Lincoln Center Festival presents the troupe at the New York State Theater from Tuesday through next Sunday, Mr. Vasiliev's staging of ''Giselle'' will open the run.. The second program, a mixed bill, includes Balanchine's ''Symphony in C.''</p>
        <p>Like the Kirov, which performs other Balanchine works, the Bolshoi has no resident choreographer and is in search of a repertory. But unlike the Kirov Ballet, whose head, Oleg Vinogradov, was replaced by a de facto director after a financial scandal, the Bolshoi seems to thrive on internal dissension.</p>
        <p>AS a general administrator who is also, unlike his predecessors, artistic director of the entire Bolshoi, Mr. Vasiliev has a major role in running its opera and ballet troupes. Having the equivalent of two artistic directors for ballet means built-in tension, which manifested itself when Mr. Vasiliev lost his first ballet director, Vyacheslav Gordeyev, in 1997. Aleksandr Bogatyrev died soon after serving briefly as interim ballet director. Mr. Fadeyechev noted that Mr. Vasiliev ''decides on the repertory for the entire theater.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Nina Ananiashvili, the Bolshoi ballerina who dances regularly with American Ballet Theater, is known to have urged the staging of the Balanchine works ''Mozartiana,''  ''Agon,''  ''Symphony in C'' and, next season, ''Bugaku.'' Mr. Fadeyechev restaged ''Don Quixote'' and said it was his idea to invite the French choreographer Pierre Lacotte to choreograph, in 19th-century style, a version of ''The Pharaoh's Daughter,'' a nearly forgotten ballet by Marius Petipa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasiliev, interviewed separately in Washington, spoke proudly of the Bolshoi range. Its two poles this year were symbolized by the contemporary dance-drama of Boris Eifman's ''Russian Hamlet'' (seen in New York with the Eifman company) and the pageantry of ''The Pharaoh's Daughter,'' acclaimed for its spectacular cascade of classical dances. Mr. Vasiliev has, however, been criticized in the press as an administrator and for his stagings of opera and ballet, notably ''Swan Lake.'' Reports in Russian magazines suggest he is on the way out.</p>
        <p>In any case, he is in a vulnerable position, having been directly appointed by the former president, Boris Yeltsin, when the Bolshoi, the Kirov, the Hermitage Museum and a few other museums were classed as national institutions directly responsible to the president. Whatever presidential protection was available to the directors of these institutions is now in doubt. They have just been returned to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture.</p>
        <p>Under a proposal from Valery Gergiev, director of the Kirov theater, the Bolshoi and Kirov theaters would be united under one administration, as in the Office of Imperial Theaters in czarist days. Since Mr. Gergiev would obviously be at the head of this joint administration, the Bolshoi's defenders predict that this would spell the end of one of the companies, and they will make sure that it is not the Bolshoi.</p>
        <p>The Kirov ''is a wonderful company,'' Mr. Fadeyechev said. ''But it's the second company.'' The Kirov corps was once supreme, he added, ''but you will see in 'La Bayadere,' ours is now the best. Our company has changed and has more precision and clarity.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of the more emotionally profound style of the past, Mr. Fadeyechev added: ''I admired the old style and regret that it is gone, but style develops. The point of the Moscow school is that it is a tradition passed down from person to person, not by videotape. Marina Semyonova started in Leningrad, but she was a Bolshoi ballerina and she still coaches at 92. She is part of the history of the Bolshoi.''</p>
        <p>The ballet masters Mr. Fadeyechev has put into place are credited by many in the company with having raised the overall level. They include his father, Nikolai Fadeyechev, the eloquent danseur noble who partnered Maya Plisetskaya in the 1950's and 1960's, and Boris Akimov, remembered for his passionate performances in the 1970's. They are the inheritors of a specifically Russian tradition, in Mr. Fadeyechev's view.</p>
        <p>''The Bolshoi is part of international culture,'' he said, ''and not a minor part. Yet it is a Russian theater because it also embodies Russian culture. Nina Ananiashvili dances abroad but her schooling is Russian.''</p>
        <p>Illustrating with a detail, he agreed that Bolshoi ballerinas like to throw both arms upward in a jete although textbook style would have them lower.</p>
        <p>W HEN you throw your arms up in a jete, you get an effect. It's expressive, not for show but for what you feel inside. Yes, it is part of a tradition. The little nuances that make up ballet style consist of where your arm is, what is your speed, what preparations you make for a step or how expressive you are. Ours is a big open style. We were taught to cover the full stage in a leap.''</p>
        <p>Asked why the Bolshoi has lost fewer dancers to the West than the Kirov in St. Petersburg after the the fall of Communism, Mr. Fadeyechev replied with a smile, like a true Muscovite: '''Have you ever tried to live in Petersburg?'' For many, Moscow is the more exciting city. ''The atmosphere is better in our company,'' Mr. Fadeyechev said. The Bolshoi dancers have also made more use of a new contract system that permits guest appearances abroad. Even Mr. Fadeyechev has a contract. The latest is for one year, and he wonders aloud how he can plan a repertory under these conditions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasiliev, sounding embattled, said the company could use 10 times the aid it receives from the federal government. This year's subsidy for the ballet troupe, according to its press office, is 209 million rubles ($7.4 million), while box-office revenue at home is 2.5 million rubles (about $90,000). That means income for productions, as opposed to operating expenses, must be generated on foreign tours and from donors. ''It'll be a shame if we are helped more by those abroad than by our own people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Unesco has, in fact, been raising money for the renovation of the Bolshoi Theater. During that time, the ballet company will move for two years into a newly built annex with 1,000 seats and a stage that Mr. Vasiliev says is as large as that of the Kennedy Center Opera House.</p>
        <p>The Bolshoi Theater as a symbol of national pride has its counterparts abroad. But in the 19th century, the Paris Opera House became a commercial house and in 1945, Roland Petit felt his creativity stifled there and left to choreograph outside the Paris Opera Ballet. An art form is not necessarily synonymous with a stone theater.</p>
        <p>Asked if the Bolshoi Theater should be regarded as just a building, Mr. Vasiliev reacted sharply and said, ''No, it's not just a building; it's a company, and it is the premier theater of Russia.''</p>
