        <p>Roughly half of the states authorize citizen ballot initiatives and more are showing up every election day as frustrated voters and advocacy groups become more and more adept at gathering the petition signatures required for ballot access.</p>
        <p>Debate is building around the country about whether initiatives are being overused, or whether they are a reasonable substitute for too little or too much legislative action. But in the absence of any consensus on that, the petition process continues to pick up speed.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is there more petitioning under way than in Oregon.</p>
        <p>This fall, election officials say, Oregonians will be asked to vote on at least 25 ballot measures. The issues include huge tax cuts, forbidding teachers to speak favorably of homosexuality, repealing the death penalty, banning animal trapping, requiring background checks to buy firearms at gun shows and limiting the amount of money spent on political campaigns.</p>
        <p>Six of the initiatives are the work of perhaps the most accomplished ballot petitioner in the country, Bill Sizemore, director of Oregon Taxpayers United, a conservative group that sees government, especially the Oregon Legislature, as a money squanderer unresponsive to normal citizen complaints.</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Sizemore worry that he and his group are perhaps overdoing the petition process by submitting half a dozen initiatives for a single election?</p>
        <p>''Who's counting?'' he replied the other day as he turned in another batch of signatures.</p>
        <p>One person who was counting was Oregon's top elections official, Secretary of State Bill Bradbury.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll have the largest voters' pamphlet in history,'' Mr. Bradbury said. ''It'll be huge, like a phone book. I'm afraid that voters will look at it as overwhelming.''</p>
