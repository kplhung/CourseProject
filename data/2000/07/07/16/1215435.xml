        <p>Moscow's best journalists, never a particularly sunny lot, now talk ominously about a return of Soviet-style controls on the press. They fear, with some reason, that the Kremlin wants to restore its choke hold on Russia, not simply by bringing order to government and business, but by setting limits for the country's struggling new media.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly promised that he intends to make press freedom a cornerstone of Russia's infant democracy. But in recent days, the former K.G.B. agent has added some disturbing new definitions for the word ''free.''</p>
        <p>During his first annual state of the nation address on July 8, Mr. Putin talked about how ''freedom of journalism has become a juicy morsel for politicians and major financial groups. . . .'' He criticized media owners who were trying ''to settle scores'' through their publications or were using their powerful voice as ''a tool for fighting government.'' Such tactics, the Russian president said, create a ''phony freedom.'' What is needed, he said, are the legal and economic conditions for a ''civilized information business.''</p>
        <p>The trouble is that one person's ''civilized information business'' is another's censored media. If Mr. Putin imposes his favored version of a ''free'' press, no matter how lofty he thinks his aims, there will not be a free press in Russia. To gain this most basic liberty for his country, Mr. Putin will need something that may be hard for a former Soviet official to comprehend -- namely a high tolerance for obstreperous and even offensive media.</p>
        <p>At this stage in its liberation from Soviet censors, Russian journalism offers about as much variety and inconsistency as the Internet. The same publication can print important news and barely rewritten corporate press releases or pornography. Verified facts are often coupled with rumors in an effort to sell more papers. Still, this untidy mix is an important stage in the media's transition. At its worst, the new Russian media are still vastly better than in the old days when truth came only in state-approved shadings.</p>
        <p>Owners of Russia's biggest media outlets have also used their power unwisely, aiming at political enemies in a vengeful way that is not unheard of in the West but which ultimately undermines their own credibility. During the 1996 presidential race, for example, Russia's new media barons commandeered the airwaves and headlines on behalf of President Boris Yeltsin, either criticizing, mocking or virtually ignoring his Communist opponent. The argument at the time was that the press was fighting for its life against a return of Communism. When Mr. Putin complains that news organizations are settling scores and fighting the government, he may be describing this tendency, especially by the large media company run by Vladimir Gusinksy.</p>
        <p>But trying to drive independent news organizations out of business or into submission is not the answer, if Mr. Putin wants a truly free press. The owner of some of the best and most independent news publications in Russia, Mr. Gusinsky has become the target of a series of investigations of alleged financial improprieties. Mr. Gusinsky, who also runs the only national television network in the country that is fully independent and steadfastly critical of Mr. Putin, was jailed for a few days last month. Mr. Gusinsky's many talented journalists fear he will be forced out as head of his Media-Most company and replaced with someone less willing to challenge the new president.</p>
        <p>The warning flags in Russia have already drawn international concern. A group of journalists, primarily from the World Press Freedom Committee and the Committee to Protect Journalists, visited Moscow last week, mainly to protest governmental threats to the media. The Westerners also advised Russian journalists to improve their standards of ethics and professionalism, to stop using their voices as a political or public relations club if they want ''to claim their vital place in building a free and democratic society.'' But those problems should be fixed by the journalists and media barons, not by the Kremlin.</p>
