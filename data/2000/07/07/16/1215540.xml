        <p>It was the lies, the jury's foreman said today.</p>
        <p>''For a period of 50 years, these tobacco companies denied the dangers of their product,'' said Leighton A. Finegan, the foreman of a six-member jury here that punished the tobacco industry with a $144.8 billion punitive damage judgment, the largest damage award in history.</p>
        <p>''They belittled or denied causation of the health effects of smoking and addiction, and had the gall to challenge public health authorities,'' and even used fabricated science to dispute the risk, Mr. Finegan said in an interview today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finegan, 44, who went into the trial believing that a person smoked cigarettes as a choice, found among his fellow jurors a reasoned and unanimous conviction to punish the tobacco industry. The point, he said, was not whether people had the choice to smoke or not to smoke, but that the companies knew they were selling a defective product and denied that it was defective.</p>
        <p>Settlements with the states that had challenged the industry had not sent that strong message, but the award of punitive damages to about 500,000 sick Florida smokers -- though certain to be appealed -- would, the jury hoped. [Page 19.]</p>
        <p>It had to come in a way, Mr. Finegan said, that would break through the wall of denial and invulnerability that had surrounded the industry for a half-century.</p>
        <p>''We had a sense of mission,'' said Mr. Finegan. ''And we did not want to ignore the tremendous devastation that the product has caused. The number had to match that. It had to be significant.</p>
        <p>''We thought it was fair. It would bring to the forefront, for the first time in the history of this country, the issues surrounding this product and the millions of lives that have been affected by this. And it would put the companies on notice -- not just the tobacco companies, all companies -- concerning fraud or misrepresentation of the American public.''</p>
        <p>But even more grating than the lies, as the panel began deliberations after two long years and 157 witnesses in the class-action suit, was the arrogance, he said.</p>
        <p>''To minimize the deaths of so many people,'' exclaimed Mr. Finegan, an assistant elementary school principal. ''We have seen the deaths of 400,000 people a year for 50 years. And they stand up in court and say that if we give a huge verdict it's a death warrant for the companies.''</p>
        <p>To all six jurors, it seemed as if the five largest tobacco makers in the country ''thumbed their noses at the system,'' even suggesting that one smoker's throat cancer was caused by wood dust, said Mr. Finegan.</p>
        <p>''They feel they are above reproach,'' he said. ''They committed fraud. They lied to the American public. They devastated millions of lives.''</p>
        <p>''It was insulting,'' the foreman said. ''It's just the tobacco industry's mentality, that they are beyond challenge. No one has ever challenged them and won.''</p>
        <p>The jury, as most juries are, was a cross section of real people, who had their lives rearranged by the sheer length and importance of this trial. The jury included, besides Mr. Finegan, a welder, a telephone technician, a postal worker, a bank teller and another school employee.</p>
        <p>The jurors were asked to consider sums of money they could not have imagined. When the punitive phase of the case ended and the judge, Robert Kaye of Miami-Dade Circuit Court, sent them to the jury room to consider the punishment, they did not just pull a number out of the air or settle on the more than $150 billion that the smokers' chief lawyer, Stanley M. Rosenblatt, demanded.</p>
        <p>They had heard witnesses for both sides testify about what the companies could pay. Lawyers for the companies had said the cigarette makers could afford to pay $150 million to $375 million, but would be put out of business if the jury granted anything approaching the requested award. The jury chose not to believe that.</p>
        <p>''I'm not an idiot,'' a juror, Gary Chwast, a 30-year-old postal worker, told The Associated Press. ''The C.E.O.'s of the tobacco companies are making millions. Why are they making so much if the companies don't have the money? What are you not telling me? It offends me.''</p>
        <p>Another juror, Delvia Ferreyra, 34, a bank teller, said: ''Their lawyers never admitted the companies were doing anything wrong.  They were denying everything from the beginning. They were trying to fool us.''</p>
        <p>John Mestre, a 48-year-old telephone repairman and the only smoker on the jury, said that from the tobacco companies' perspective, ''Everybody's cancer was caused by something other than smoking.''</p>
        <p>In the jury room, in the less than five hours of deliberations, the jurors each named a figure, ranging from $100 billion to $200 billion. The members of the jury averaged those figures and came to $145 billion.</p>
        <p>Then, they looked at the market share of each of the five companies and two institutes that had given false information about smoking, and using that and other financial information, broke down the total:  Philip Morris, the country's largest cigarette maker, $73.96 billion; R. J. Reynolds, $36.28 billion; Brown &amp; Williamson, $17.59 billion; Lorrilard Tobacco, $16.25 billion; Liggett Group, $790 million; the Council for Tobacco Research, $1.195 million; and the Tobacco Institute, $278,389.</p>
        <p>After the verdict was announced on Friday afternoon, ''I felt a great sense of relief that what we did was right and justified according to the evidence presented,'' Mr. Finegan said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mestre said of the verdict: ''I think it was fair. The object was to send a message that what was happening wasn't going to cut it in terms of the behavior of the tobacco companies.''</p>
        <p>As a smoker, Mr. Mestre said, ''It affected me more when I started looking into the documents and seeing the deception. It was frightening.'' He said he has cut back but still finds it difficult to quit.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Finegan said, he and the other the jurors -- Mr. Chwast, Ms. Ferreyra, Mr. Mestre, Jacqueline Brinson and James Strowbridge --  -- are probably among the best educated people in the country on the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finegan still has the notice he received on July 8, 1998, informing him to report for jury duty.</p>
        <p>An assistant principal at an elementary school in the Kendall area, south of Miami, he was a former teacher of social studies and American history, who had lectured students -- from his heart, not just the book -- on civic responsibility.</p>
        <p>''I thought it would just be a short thing,'' he said. ''I would serve for a month or two and that would be it. I would complete my civic duty, and I would have something to take back to the school and tell the kids about.</p>
        <p>''I would have a greater insight into the legal process, and I could bring a wealth of information back. Never for one moment did I think this would be two years.''</p>
        <p>The trial took over his life and the lives of the other jurors, he said. It was not just the time it took them away from their families. They saw their futures rearranged by it.</p>
        <p>They gave up promotions because of it, he said. Mr. Finegan, who has a wife, Marice, and a 3-year-old son, had helped start a magnet school in Miami-Dade, but had to give up his job there because the trial consumed so much of his time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mestre described the trial as a burden that lasted for two-thirds of his 3-year-old son's life. ''His first words were 'jury duty,' '' Mr. Mestre said.</p>
        <p>During jury selection, Mr. Finegan, who immigrated to the United States from Jamaica in 1988, said he had no strong feelings about smoking, and had always felt that if person smoked, it was through their own free will.</p>
        <p>Then came months of information, scientific data and testimony from people who had had throats and lungs surgically removed, and evidence that showed the addictive nature of the product and how it was made to be addictive.</p>
        <p>One woman testified by videotape. She had died as the trial dragged on, and a tape was shown after her death.</p>
        <p>The industry first said it was not as bad as it was being made to appear, but the jury ruled, in July 1999, that the tobacco industry manufactured a deadly product, and that it had deceived the public for years. In April the jury ordered the companies to pay $12.7 million in compensatory damages to the smokers. In the punitive stage of the trial, the stage just concluded, sick smokers first asked for $196 billion in damages. But their lead lawyer, Mr. Rosenblatt, would eventually suggest an award of $154 billion to the jury.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, as the trial went on and Mr. Finegan was gone so much from work, someone moved into his office at the school. He said he began to feel out of place, marginal. He was a part-time worker in a full-time job.</p>
        <p>There was a big window in the jury room, he said. Sometimes he and the others would just sit in front of it and watch people walk by -- people going about their lives without such grave responsibility.</p>
        <p>''We saw people going about their daily routines,'' he said. ''Sometimes we felt like we weren't going anywhere. We were stationary.''</p>
        <p>They saw their families at night, but much of a person's worth, he said, is in how they do their job, and they were not at their jobs.</p>
        <p>''You don't have your goals and aspirations being achieved,'' he said. The other members of the jury spoke about it, too, he said. ''Someone else is carrying on your job,'' he said. ''It devalued my job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Finegan could not talk about his life's focus, that trial, with anyone but the other five jurors. ''There was a movie that came out called 'The Insider,' about the tobacco industry. We were told not to watch it.''</p>
        <p>The jurors sat beside each other so long they became friends, baking birthday cakes and exchanging Christmas presents. ''We got pretty close,'' he said. ''We got to know each other's temperaments, personalities. We celebrated each other's birthdays, knew each other's jobs.'' They shared pictures of their children.</p>
        <p>Even though they had an awesome responsibility before them, he said, ''we felt somewhat inconsequential.''</p>
        <p>Then, literally, came judgment day.</p>
        <p>Oddly, or perhaps not oddly at all, the six members of the jury did not scatter after the verdict was read. They went to a cafe in Coconut Grove, together. They promised to keep in touch.</p>
