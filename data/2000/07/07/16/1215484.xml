        <p>This is the time of year in the National Football League when many players pack their bags, kiss their wives and kids goodbye, give up their luxury homes and move into a dormitory for a month. Oh, do players hate training camp! The constant pounding, the bad food and the twice-a-day practices in 100 percent humidity with coaches screaming at them. Lovely.</p>
        <p>That may be why Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss is seemingly trying to delay the inevitable.

        <p>This is the time of year in the National Football League when many players pack their bags, kiss their wives and kids goodbye, give up their luxury homes and move into a dormitory for a month. Oh, do players hate training camp! The constant pounding, the bad food and the twice-a-day practices in 100 percent humidity with coaches screaming at them. Lovely.</p>
        <p>That may be why Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Randy Moss is seemingly trying to delay the inevitable. With the Vikings' camp to start next Sunday, Moss on Friday played the last of a handful of basketball games in the Southern California Summer Pro League. While most players try to get their last full nights of sleep, Moss was working on his jump shot.</p>
        <p>Moss, who played high school basketball in West Virginia, has never hidden his desire to play the sport professionally one day. Surprisingly, the Vikings took a laid-back approach to their star's participating in the summer hoops league. That attitude is different from the one most organizations would take. Many coaches would stay awake at night sweating out nightmares that Moss, the best wideout in the game, was twisting an ankle or blowing out a knee on the court.</p>
        <p>There is also a great personal risk for Moss. He is looking for a contract extension worth more than the $56 million Keyshawn Johnson received from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in April. Nothing like a torn knee ligament after a dunk to ruin contract negotiations.</p>
        <p>As training camps begin in earnest this week, Moss and the Vikings are among a number of interesting stories coming into the summer practices. Minnesota has handed the reigns of its offense to the second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper. A risk, to be sure, but Coach Dennis Green has taken risks before, and most have paid off. After all, he drafted Moss, who was considered a risk because of his off-the-field problems in high school and college. But Moss has been a solid citizen.</p>
        <p>Here are 10 things to watch as camps open (sweat not included):</p>
        <p>1. THE BALTIMORE RAVENS -- The owner, Art Modell, is excited about his team, saying, ''This is the most optimistic I have felt going into a training camp in years.'' He should be thrilled. The team has one of the top defenses in the league, so the Ravens spent the off-season upgrading the offense by adding the free agent tight end Shannon Sharpe and by drafting Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis and Florida wideout Travis Taylor.</p>
        <p>Baltimore might be the surprise of the league this season, but only if quarterback Tony Banks becomes a consistent leader.</p>
        <p>2. CHEMISTRY IN BUFFALO -- Quarterback Rob Johnson took Doug Flutie's job at the end of last season, and make no mistake, Flutie wants it back, and he is not one to stay quiet if Johnson struggles. That situation could be a running soap opera for much of the season.</p>
        <p>3. GIANTS MOVES -- Quietly, General Manager Ernie Accorsi had a tremendous off-season. He has gotten the team's salary cap complications under control, while completely revamping the offensive line and drafting Ron Dayne. He also added Michael Barrow to pair with his pal Jessie Armstead at linebacker. The Giants have more of an edge now, and if they win, which will depend largely on the play of quarterback Kerry Collins, Accorsi should be strongly considered for executive of the year.</p>
        <p>4. THE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS -- With so much attention focused on the spending by the Washington Redskins, it is easy to forget that St. Louis is still the Super Bowl champ. The Rams' only significant change was drafting the burner Trung Candidate, a wide receiver out of Arizona, giving them even more speed. The challenge for the Rams is that the team will surprise no one, and toward the end of last season, defenses had begun to decipher quarterback Kurt Warner.</p>
        <p>5. TOM COUGHLIN'S LAST STAND? -- The Jacksonville Jaguars have been one of the more successful franchises of the last few years, but Tennessee has outclassed them in the playoffs. Time is short for the head coach, Tom Coughlin, and the quarterback, Mark Brunell, who has not played a full season since 1996 because of injury. If the Jaguars do not advance deep into the playoffs, look for those rumors about Coughlin going to Notre Dame to start yet again.</p>
        <p>6. BRAIN DRAIN -- The league lost quarterbacks Dan Marino and Steve Young to retirement, and John Elway left the year before, but there is still plenty of talent at the position. Troy Aikman, Drew Bledsoe and Brett Favre will look to rebound from average seasons. Then there is Peyton Manning, considered the best quarterback in the game.</p>
        <p>7. STAR RUNNERS -- The keys to two franchises are coming off devastating knee injuries. The knee of Denver's Terrell Davis seems to be doing fine, while Atlanta's Jamal Anderson is having some problems after his reconstructive surgery. Both players must be completely healthy if their teams are to make it back to the postseason. Meanwhile, Atlanta Coach Dan Reeves said he planned to run a more physical training camp than last season. Reeves did the same thing on occasion when he was in New York, to mixed results.</p>
        <p>8. THE WORST FRANCHISE -- Cleveland was the only team in the league not to score a touchdown on an interception, kick, punt or fumble return last season. But the Browns had an excuse. They are an expansion team. Cincinnati, perhaps the worst franchise in sports, has no such excuse. Wide receiver Carl Pickens wants out of town, and running back Corey Dillon hates the team so much he has vowed to play only six games next year, the minimum required to earn his fourth year of eligibility and thus become a free agent.</p>
        <p>9. MERRY-GO-ROUND -- Seven teams changed coaches, but the one with the toughest job may be the Jets' Al Groh, who is following Bill Parcells. Coach Jim Haslett in New Orleans also has a difficult task. He must get inside the head of Ricky Williams, the space cadet running back who has managed to alienate most of his teammates. If Williams starts to run and stops complaining, the Saints could do some damage in the average N.F.C. West.</p>
        <p>10. THE BUCCANEER -- Perhaps the single best free-agent acquisition was Tampa Bay's signing of wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. When their training camp begins next Sunday, the team will see that Johnson is brilliant, selfish and tough. Most of all, he's a winner.</p>
        <p>Agreement by Redskins</p>
        <p>Washington is closing in on signing its top two picks, linebacker LaVar Arrington and offensive tackle Chris Samuels. The team has basically agreed on the signing bonus language, which would pay Arrington about $10.5 million and Samuels about $500,000 less.</p>
        <p>There is still work to be done, but agreeing on the bonus is half the battle. Getting their two draft picks in camp would be a major coup for the Redskins, a team many believe will make a run at the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Two More Halls of Fame</p>
        <p>Oakland owner Al Davis plans to propose that two branches of the Pro Football Hall of Fame be built in high-tourist traffic areas such as Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim, Calif. Davis hopes people who cannot visit the Hall in Canton, Ohio, would be able to visit replicas elsewhere. It's a good idea, but one purists won't like.</p>
