        <p>In ''A Madison Avenue Fantasy,'' (Seniority, July 2), Fred Brock discussed the advertising industry's continuing emphasis on young consumers, despite the greater wealth and increasing numbers of older adults. The column drew varied responses from readers.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In wondering why ''Network Row  and Madison Avenue think young eyeballs are worth more to them than older ones,'' Mr. Brock cited statistics comparing net worth and future populations of young and old. His point was that advertisers are ''aiming where the money increasingly isn't.''</p>
        <p>In fact, advertisers are focusing on the population that is forming brand  loyalties in products, services and entertainment as well as buying first  homes. That is in contrast with my own household, which consists of two people over 60 (with money), disinclined to try new products and with very limited needs for new acquisitions.</p>
        <p>Simply put, advertisers know what they're doing.</p>
