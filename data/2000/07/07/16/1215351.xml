        <p>The Female Athlete 800-303-5342 or www.thefemaleathlete.com</p>
        <p>Preface: Girl-gear catalog, started by Mary Tenety and Lori Schmid, whose daughters play on soccer and softball teams in Babylon, N.Y. ''Most big sports stores have a definite masculine approach,'' Ms. Tenety said. ''There was no one place to buy a bat for a small girl or a batting helmet that could accommodate a ponytail. Plus, we wanted a catalog that would show our girls that being athletic and strong is feminine and that being feminine can be athletic and strong.''</p>
        <p>Esthetic hook: High-five fashion at low, low prices.  The gear: Workout capri sweat pants ($24), ponytail-friendly batting helmet ($27), sports strips barrettes to ''take your hair out of the game'' ($4). And sports Powerbead bracelets ($8), videos and books like ''Living the Dream'' (Kensington, $19.95), the autobiography of Dot Richardson, the softball star.  Sample nail polish colors: Hustle (orange), Scrimmage (white), CrunchTime (blue), Guts'n Glory (navy), LovetoPlay (fuchsia).  Scores high on: Practicality. Afford ability. Team spirit.  Scores low on: Irony.  M.V.P.: The Dedicated Mom T-shirt, emblazoned: ''She drives. She waits. She cheers. Dedicated Mom.'' Clutch!</p>
