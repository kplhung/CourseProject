        <p>Toby LaMarche and Katie Stukes, Harlem, New York</p>
        <p>LaMarche (white woman at center): The funeral was for the sister of Katie, my oldest and dearest friend. She came to work for my parents when I was six weeks old and she was 18. She has stayed my closest friend ever since. We've gone through all of our important experiences in life together. Katie is one of 17 children, and Comell was the one she was closest to. As much as I was grieving for Comell, I was grieving for Katie's pain. I consider her family. Even when I was a child I considered Katie my friend, not somebody who worked for the family. She was the closest person to me. When I grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, it was unusual for blacks and whites to be such good friends. I don't believe when my parents hired her they ever had the idea that we were going to be best friends. But from my perspective, race was never an issue, and it disturbed me whenever it was an issue to somebody else. I never could understand why that was important. We're different religions, different races, we come from the most different backgrounds imaginable, and none of that has ever made the slightest bit of difference to either of us.</p>
        <p>Stukes (in gold hat, at right): It was my sister Comell's funeral. I was sitting with Toby, thinking about Comell and when we grew up. My mom died when I was 2. So Comell was like a mother to me. In 1942, when I was 18, Comell was working with some friends of Toby's mother, and they needed somebody to baby-sit. It was my first job. I took care of Toby from when she was a baby. I never had children myself, so Toby is more than a daughter to me. Sometimes mommas and daughters get angry, but we never got mad at each other. People were surprised at our friendship. In the 1950's, I remember, people would look at us in restaurants. It never mattered to Toby. She'd meet me in the middle of the street and just open her arms and hug me. I was glad to have her there the day of the funeral. It was very hard, but having Toby there helped. I've been going to St. Samuel's church up here in Harlem for 41 years. I've brought Toby many times and introduced her to the reverend and my friends. She has me to her house for Passover Seders, and her friends have become my friends, too. I'm 76, so I've had a lot friends in my life, but I've never had anyone like her. She always tells me we'll be friends until we leave here. I think so too.</p>
