      <abstract>
        <p>Stanley N Kurtz letter opposes Robert Coles' review of Christina Hoff Sommers' book War Against Boys for failing to note myriad ways in which boys are being left behind by educational system mired in feminist orthodoxies</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In an era when feminist books by the hundreds come sailing out of the academy, the moment when The Times Book Review turns its attention to that rarity of rarities -- a thoughtful critique of feminism -- elicits shivers of anticipation. Dare we hope that a book like Christina Hoff Sommers's ''War Against Boys'' might be given full and fair treatment? Apparently not. Not only is the review of Sommers (June 25) bundled with a review of William S. Pollack, one of her adversaries, but the reviewer himself, Robert Coles, is a Harvard colleague of both Pollack and Sommers's other chief antagonist, Carol Gilligan.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In an era when feminist books by the hundreds come sailing out of the academy, the moment when The Times Book Review turns its attention to that rarity of rarities -- a thoughtful critique of feminism -- elicits shivers of anticipation. Dare we hope that a book like Christina Hoff Sommers's ''War Against Boys'' might be given full and fair treatment? Apparently not. Not only is the review of Sommers (June 25) bundled with a review of William S. Pollack, one of her adversaries, but the reviewer himself, Robert Coles, is a Harvard colleague of both Pollack and Sommers's other chief antagonist, Carol Gilligan.</p>
        <p>Coles devotes his all-too-brief discussion of Sommers's book to a defense of the ''anecdotal'' and ''impressionistic'' methods used by Gilligan and Pollack. Qualitative research is indispensable, it is true, but Gilligan presents her research as not merely impressionistic but quantitative. That is why it is so disturbing that she seems unwilling to make her research data public, and that is why Sommers's own quantitative and thoroughly researched refutation of Gilligan's claims is so devastating.</p>
        <p>But the most disturbing thing about Coles's review is that he tells us virtually nothing about what Sommers's book actually says -- nothing about the myriad ways in which boys, rather than girls, are being left behind by an educational system mired in feminist orthodoxies.</p>
