        <p>MAYBE trees can grow to the sky.</p>
        <p>Nobody will confuse it with a sequoia, but just now JDS Uniphase, the fiber optic component manufacturer, sure is sprouting.</p>
        <p>Until a little over a year ago, JDS and Uniphase were separate companies. Then they merged. The combined company has since bought four others, counting SDL Inc., a big rival that it agreed to acquire last week for a tidy $41 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>JDS Uniphase shares have certainly been popular currency. When the JDS-Uniphase merger closed in July 1999, the market capitalization of the combined company was about $14 billion. At the end of last week it was more than $100 billion, and that is down about 28percent from its 52-week peak.</p>
        <p>Nikos Theodosopoulos, a communications equipment analyst at UBS Warburg, spent some time last week talking about the company and its latest deal. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q.Investors are clearly excited over the prospects for this industry. How big is it, and how fast is it growing?</p>
        <p>A. We estimate the fiber optics components market, which is what JDS Uniphase sells into, will be about an $8.5 billion market this year, and will grow somewhere between 50 percent and 70 percent this year and in 2001.</p>
        <p>Q. JDS Uniphase's growth is vaguely reminiscent of the strategy that Cisco Systems has employed over the last decade, using its stock to buy companies and to grow. Is that a fair comparison?</p>
        <p>A. It is similar to Cisco, but JDS Uniphase has really collapsed the time frame. All of these deals have happened over the last 12 months or so, which is much more concentrated than Cisco.</p>
        <p>They have had a good currency in their stock and a very strong, visionary management team. They have used the two to build the leading supplier of fiber optic components, and in the process pre-empted everyone else from doing what they have accomplished.</p>
        <p>Q. Why did JDS Uniphase want SDL?</p>
        <p>A. SDL manufactures the best pump laser chips and modules in the industry. And of the three main technologies that facilitate the splitting or combining of light, JDS Uniphase has leading market share in the thin-filled filter technology, but doesn't have much of a presence in array wave guide. SDL does.</p>
        <p>The other point to emphasize is that this is a consolidating industry. Corning was in negotiations to buy SDL, and others may have made similar overtures. So this deal keeps SDL from being acquired by someone else.</p>
        <p>Q. Who are the company's competitors?</p>
        <p>A. Well, Corning is one. Lucent has a microelectronics division that competes, and Nortel is a competitor to a lesser degree. And there are number of competitors in Japan, companies like Furukawa. There are a few others that have recently gone public, but they are much smaller players.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you see any problems with the deal for SDL?</p>
        <p>A. There are two risks, and the biggest one is regulatory.</p>
        <p>We think the deal will be approved, but JDS Uniphase may be asked to sell something to get it done. Worst case, they may have to spin out their pump laser chip facility in Zurich. That is where JDS Uniphase and SDL have a combined market share of between 70 percent and 80 percent.</p>
        <p>The other risk is integrating these two companies, which is a risk with any merger.</p>
        <p>But right now, the optical market is so hot and so strong the companies are operating as if they were independent. It's not as if there are redundancies. The risk is making sure excess capacity can be found. There is not a cost-saving element, but a challenge to realize the synergies and generate new products.</p>
        <p>Q. JDS Uniphase shares were pounded for a couple of days after the deal was announced and then recovered. Is the stock likely to bounce around for awhile?</p>
        <p>A. Since this deal will get regulatory scrutiny, the stock will be manipulated more than normal by risk arbitrageurs. And since the deal isn't likely to close until the end of the year, for the next five months or so the stock may not perform very well.</p>
        <p>Q. If you are right, and the stock doesn't do much over the next few months, does that period represent a buying opportunity?</p>
        <p>A. We don't anticipate a slowdown in their business, because bandwidth and the Internet continue to grow, and new high-speed applications continue to grow. Fundamentally, they are in great shape.</p>
        <p>If you have more than a four-month time horizon, this is a good time to buy the stock. We think this is a core long-term holding.</p>
        <p>The stock is certainly expensive. But that is the nature of the market right now for very high growth sectors. People are paying a premium for companies that are growing very, very rapidly.</p>
