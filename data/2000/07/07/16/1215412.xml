      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The idea sounds charming: close off the street, lay down brick pavement, plant shady trees and transform the block into a quiet haven from the rest of the city.</p>
        <p>But the plan, proposed by the Fashion Institute of Technology for a stretch of 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, met with strong opposition from residents and businesses at a hearing on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The block is already an informal campus for the university's 12,000 students. A hulking concrete catwalk, embossed with its  name, welcomes visitors on Seventh Avenue. Since 1979, traffic on the westbound street has been restricted on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>As part of a major renovation, the institute wants to seal off traffic completely, except for emergency vehicles, and create a landscaped pedestrian mall.</p>
        <p>''The plan provides the college with an enriched identity by integrating our dormitories and academic facilities,'' said Harvey Spector, vice president of finance and operations.</p>
        <p>But the mall would only cover the eastern two-thirds of the street, where the university's huge buildings are clustered. The western part of the street, where there are four residential and commercial high-rises, would become two-way, for pick-ups and deliveries.</p>
        <p>Although residents were initially favorable, many now say they oppose the plan.</p>
        <p>''We believe this proposal will only benefit F.I.T. and turn our western end of the block into a noisy, chaotic and potentially dangerous loading zone,'' said Gail Dobish, vice president of the 27th Street Block Association.</p>
        <p>Critics also said the proposed traffic turnaround is too narrow to accommodate the 70 small businesses on the block.</p>
        <p>''If there's one truck in there, the whole road will be backed up,'' said Joe Martinow, manager of Fashion Design Books, a supplier of students' textbooks.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the point, Julius Panero, a former design professor at F.I.T. and owner of a building on the block, brought a couple of matchbox cars to the meeting to demonstrate the difficulty of negotiating a three-point turn inside the 50-foot-wide cul-de-sac.</p>
        <p>Community Board 5, which sponsored the hearing, rejected the design on Thursday. But the $1.5 million project has been approved by the city's Department of Transportation and by the Dormitory Authority, which oversees college buildings in the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spector said that the university had incorporated many suggestions from the community board and he hoped construction would begin this year.</p>
