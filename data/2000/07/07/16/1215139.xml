        <p>WHERE will the USA Network turn in September, when it loses the wrestling shows that have helped make it the top-rated cable station in prime time? One place could be the weekly music series ''Farmclub.com,'' which already ranks third on the network among males 12 to 24 -- behind USA's two prime-time wrestling programs -- and is clobbering MTV head to head.</p>
        <p>''Farmclub.com,'' which in some ways resembles an infomercial more than a TV show, is a curious hybrid, created, as its name suggests, in response to the ways in which the Internet is changing entertainment. At first glance, it looks like any other music show, with its mix of videos, interviews and artist profiles. But the uninhibited live performances turned in by well-known performers like Eminem, Kid Rock and Macy Gray differentiate it from other music programs: on ''Farmclub,'' artists get superior sound, a thrust stage within touching distance of the audience and the authentic feel of a live performance.</p>
        <p>And the program, which began in January and runs Mondays at 11 p.m., is distinctive in another way: it represents only one arm of a venture that also includes a music label and a Web site, all of which feed into and off of one another, a rare example of the corporate convergence of old and new media in action.</p>
        <p>The company was formed last fall by the veteran music executives Jimmy Iovine (co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A &amp; M) and Doug Morris (chairman of Universal Music Group), both of whom were major figures in the recording industry long before MTV altered the music landscape in the early 1980's. As the success of Internet music sites like MP3.com began to reshape the business again, the two were looking for a way to establish an online presence for Universal Music (of which Interscope Geffen is a unit) and to exploit the new media universe. Their idea was simple: create a Web site where fledgling bands can upload their music; use online polling to determine which have commercial potential; then promote those bands on a television show and perhaps give them record contracts. Financed by Universal Music, the company's official title is Jimmy and Doug's Farmclub.com, with Mr. Iovine serving as chairman.</p>
        <p>Farmclub's founders targeted teenage boys as their audience. And where better to find those boys than on USA's high-rated World Wrestling Federation program ''Raw Is War,'' which attracts a large young male audience? ''If you're going to be on one hour a week, that's the place to be,'' Mr. Iovine said during an interview at Interscope's Santa Monica offices. ''What I've learned about music is that it starts with the young kids. From there, you can build a real active following.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Iovine and Mr. Morris were determined to follow the W.W.F. with their own show, which, like an infomercial, was conceived to direct viewers to the Farmclub Web site. Instead of licensing ''Farmclub.com'' to the cable network, they purchased the hour outright, again following the practice of infomercial advertisers.</p>
        <p>The deal, which runs through April 2001, is an example of a ''time buy,'' commonly used for one-time specials such as CBS's broadcast last month of ''A.F.I.'s 100 Years . . . 100 Laughs.'' Such arrangements are less common in series television; but buying its own time slot protected ''Farmclub'' from cancellation if it failed to catch on immediately.</p>
        <p>''A music television show can take time to develop,'' said the president of Farmclub, Andy Schuon, a former MTV executive. ''This was a show we couldn't afford to have kicked off the air.''</p>
        <p>So far, the investment is paying off, at least in the Nielsen ratings. In addition to ranking third among males 12 to 24 for USA, ''Farmclub.com'' has more viewers in that category than any program on MTV, TBS or TNT, including the World Championship Wrestling shows running on TBS and TNT. As of June 26, ''Farmclub.com'' averaged more than one million viewers per show, compared to MTV's half-million viewers in the same hour (during which the music cable network broadcasts a variety of life style and music programs).</p>
        <p>The show's success may have something to do with its choice time slot, but it can also be attributed to the program's populist programming strategy. With the former MTV host Matt Pinfield and the actress Ali Landry as hosts, the program offers unknown bands the chance to make their national television debuts. The show's staff plucks those bands off the Farmclub Web site, where visitors vote for their favorite songs each month. The luckiest artists land a record deal (three Farmclub acts have signed such deals), but even without a contract most winners appear on the television show.</p>
        <p>''There are plenty of sites on which independent bands can upload their music,'' said Brian Richards, a media entertainment consultant at Price Waterhouse Coopers. ''But because of Farmclub's television show, its promotional reach allows them to take these bands to the next level.''</p>
        <p>Compared to most hourlong programs on cable, ''Farmclub.com,'' is relatively inexpensive to produce. According to industry observers, USA charges Farmclub $80,000 to $100,000 for each hour, while production costs average approximately $250,000 per program. Although Farmclub controls most of the show's advertising time, Mr. Iovine acknowledges that the program has yet to turn a profit. But he added that the company eventually hoped to generate most of its revenue through e-commerce and subscription services on its Web site.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest impediment to the continued success of ''Farmclub.com'' on USA is its reportedly rocky marriage with the cable network. Universal Music is a unit of the Seagram Company Ltd., which, in turn, owns a 43 percent stake in USA. Farmclub's presence on the network is widely perceived as an in-house deal that may have angered some USA executives who were hesitant to part with such a valuable programming hour.</p>
        <p>MR. IOVINE denied that there was friction between Farmclub and USA, as did USA Cable's president, Stephen Chao, who nevertheless acknowledged that the 11 p.m. Monday night hour was one of the network's ''more important'' time periods.</p>
        <p>''But Jimmy Iovine is a smart competitor,'' he added, ''and it's in my interest to be in business with him.''</p>
        <p>Following last month's announcements that the World Wrestling Federation will be leaving USA for Viacom's TNN, and that the French conglomerate Vivendi will be acquiring Seagram, the future relationship between ''Farmclub.com'' and the USA network is up in the air. Whether Vivendi backs Farmclub's position on USA's schedule or whether Farmclub jumps ship in search of a better lead-in for its program remains undetermined.</p>
        <p>But even if the show were to shut down tomorrow, Mr. Iovine seems satisfied with what the series has accomplished. ''We've made a lot of noise, and we've had a longer run than most TV shows,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris agrees. ''The key to this is to get out there and create a brand name that becomes a part of today's culture,'' he said. ''Whether we'll succeed or not, I don't know. But we're off to a good start.''</p>
