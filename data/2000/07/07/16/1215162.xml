        <p>Few cities in Europe feel as laid back as Amsterdam, with its preference for pedestrians and bikes, its outdoor cafes and easygoing policies on drugs and sex. But amid the strollers are more than flower children. Pickpockets and bag snatchers thrive precisely because people seem so much at ease and distracted.</p>
        <p>They operate of course where most of the tourists are: the tram lines (especially Nos. 1, 2 and 5), which go to the main museums; on the train connecting Schiphol Airport and the city; in and around the Central Station, and at waiting lines for tour boats or ferries. Groups of two or three young people are likely to use a classic technique: one asks for directions, while another reaches for your bag or backpack.</p>

        <p>Few cities in Europe feel as laid back as Amsterdam, with its preference for pedestrians and bikes, its outdoor cafes and easygoing policies on drugs and sex. But amid the strollers are more than flower children. Pickpockets and bag snatchers thrive precisely because people seem so much at ease and distracted.</p>
        <p>They operate of course where most of the tourists are: the tram lines (especially Nos. 1, 2 and 5), which go to the main museums; on the train connecting Schiphol Airport and the city; in and around the Central Station, and at waiting lines for tour boats or ferries. Groups of two or three young people are likely to use a classic technique: one asks for directions, while another reaches for your bag or backpack.</p>
        <p>This city may well have the greatest bicycle density of any European capital, but it does not mean people won't steal yours. Bicycle theft is so common that anyone renting a bike should automatically take out insurance. Similarly, leaving property visible inside a parked car can be an invitation for trouble.</p>
        <p>Amsterdam's police offer other warnings. You will never win if you are talked into playing Balletje, the Dutch version of the game where a ball is hidden under one of three cups: here it is a paper ball and three matchboxes. The main player usually tricks you with the help of accomplices. And for all the Netherlands' supposed permissiveness toward soft drugs, it is only marijuana that is legal. The police note that not only are cocaine, heroin, ecstasy and the like illegal, but also that tourists are frequently sold fake drugs. Buying drugs on the streets is one of the biggest tourist traps, the police say, adding that the fake drugs may be soap powder, sugar, rat poison or at best crushed vitamin C.</p>
        <p>Still, even respectable tourists often cannot resist visiting the red light district, if only to peer at the garish display of young women in their windows awaiting customers. But again there are perils. Some of the prostitutes are transvestites. Moreover,  loud protests can provoke the ire of muscular pimps. Still, there are police around who are willing to help -- and all speak English. And if you have been using the offered services, don't play the innocent. As the local police point out, they know why you're here and you can hardly surprise them anymore. One useful source for misplaced items is the Lost and Found Station, Stephensonstraat 18, telephone (31-20) 5593005; open on weekdays. The general emergency number is 112.</p>
