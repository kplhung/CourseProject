        <p>OLIVER SIODMAK and his wife, Sharon, were walking past Fairway on Broadway and 74th Street last summer when they saw a woman named Pat Haldeman with a box full of eight puppies. Just a week old, the puppies had been abandoned outside an animal rescue center.

        <p>The Siodmaks, dog lovers but not dog owners, agreed to take four puppies home. With the help of a veterinary assistant, Oliver and Sharon Siodmak nursed the dogs to the point where they were able to find homes for two and a place at the Bide-a-Wee animal shelter for the other two. But 24 hours after giving up Chestnut and Lucy, ''We realized we were miserable,'' Mr. Siodmak said. They went back to Bide-a-Wee and returned home with the 7-week-old Chestnut, who is part Rhodesian Ridgeback, part Labrador retriever.</p>

        <p>OLIVER SIODMAK and his wife, Sharon, were walking past Fairway on Broadway and 74th Street last summer when they saw a woman named Pat Haldeman with a box full of eight puppies. Just a week old, the puppies had been abandoned outside an animal rescue center. Since the center could not care for dogs that young, it had gone to Pat Haldeman, who turned to people like Mr. and Mrs. Siodmak (pronounced see-ODD-mack), who had contributed financially to her animal-rescue efforts.</p>
        <p>The Siodmaks, dog lovers but not dog owners, agreed to take four puppies home. With the help of a veterinary assistant, Oliver and Sharon Siodmak nursed the dogs to the point where they were able to find homes for two and a place at the Bide-a-Wee animal shelter for the other two. But 24 hours after giving up Chestnut and Lucy, ''We realized we were miserable,'' Mr. Siodmak said. They went back to Bide-a-Wee and returned home with the 7-week-old Chestnut, who is part Rhodesian Ridgeback, part Labrador retriever.</p>
        <p>Then they almost lost their home. The Siodmaks' apartment building, on 57th Street, did not allow dogs, and the couple was served a notice of eviction. They hired a lawyer who specialized in representing pet owners and who fought the eviction long enough for them to find a new apartment that permitted them to live with Chestnut and their two cats.</p>
        <p>The next step was to find a proper caregiver for those times when Mr. Siodmak, a consultant for I.B.M., and Mrs. Siodmak, a corporate recruiter, were at work. The Siodmaks fixed on an increasingly popular solution: dog day care.</p>
        <p>At least 10 centers, most in Manhattan, but a few in Brooklyn, allow apartment-dwelling dog owners to drop off their pets on their way to work and pick them up on their way home. The dogs spend all day running, playing and socializing. According to their masters, it's the best thing for them.</p>
        <p>''Dogs love to play with dogs. That's the bottom line,'' said John Yuder, a fabric importer whose boxer, Baron, has been attending Run Spot Run, a day care center on East 91st Street, since he was 6 months old.</p>
        <p>Dog day care isn't a new phenomenon, but it has boomed in the last three years. Joe Sporn says his center, Yuppie Puppy, which he founded 13 years ago on West 86th Street, was the first to open in the United States. Many have followed. Business, he says, was steady until the last three or four years when it boomed. Now Mr. Sporn has competitors, like Canine Country, which opened eight years ago on West 75th Street, and Animal General, which opened months ago in the basement of its veterinary clinic on West 67th Street.</p>
        <p>Dog day care owners like Mr. Sporn and Jim Murphy, the majority owner of both Canine Country and Run Spot Run, say their business has doubled or tripled in the past three years. The expansion is driven by three of the most powerful forces in New York: affluence, love and guilt. Dale Van Pamelen, a former cafe owner who opened New York Dog Spa almost three years ago after looking for a place for his own dog, said: ''It's amazing. This is the first business I've been in where price is not an issue.  The demand is unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Although others are sure to enter the business, those currently in the business are not worried. ''It's very difficult to own a dog in the city,'' Mr. Sporn said. ''If you do a good job, if you're good to the dogs, you will always have customers. There are so many dogs.''</p>
        <p>Prices range from $15 per day for a small dog at Run Spot Run to $32 for a large dog at New York Dog Spa. The average is about $25 per day (10 to 14 hours). Some centers give discounts to owners who pay by the month.</p>
        <p>A few dogs are bused in, which adds $10 for the round trip. The annual cost for those whose dogs go to day care daily can exceed $6,000. Is this insane? Not to Mr. Sporn, who noted that he paid $500 per month to park a car in Manhattan. Considered, $5,000 or $6,000 to park the dog makes perfect sense to some.</p>
        <p>Providers say that like many other luxuries, dog care has become a necessity for some. Without it, many busy Manhattanites would be unable to own a dog, Mr. Murphy says. Mr. Van Pamelen added, ''If you create the situation, they end up getting somewhat addicted to it.''</p>
        <p>Dog owners say the cost is worth it and a good value compared with hiring a dog-walker, itself a New York phenomenon. Paul Stapleton, a salesman for a financial printing company, credits Run Spot Run with turning Hannah, his 3-year-old Jack Russell terrier puppy, into a happy, sociable dog.</p>
        <p>Sharon Decker, who teaches English at the State University of New York Maritime College, in the Bronx, says she goes out of her way to bring her golden retriever puppy, Bryce, to Yuppie Puppy because the workers there really care about dogs. She said she was pleased that some of the same dogs that Bryce ran with in Central Park also attended Yuppie Puppy.</p>
        <p>Some owners bring their dogs to day care every day, others a few times a week. A day at day care, owners say, relieves them of the responsibility of exercising their animals. The price of day care buys peace of mind.  Owners also say that when their dogs get home they are dog tired, which, for a dog, is just plain tired.</p>
        <p>Several of the day care entrepreneurs are contemplating expansion. Mr. Van Pamelen says he will open a new center in TriBeCa or the Upper East Side as soon as he can find an appropriately large space. Keith Durst, a former corporate lawyer who started the Wagging Tail in 1998 in TriBeCa, says he is planning new centers in Chelsea and Park Slope. He is also helping to open a franchise in San Francisco, one of just a few cities in the country apart from New York that could support such a business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sporn, the putative founder of the dog day care industry, says he, too, is hatching plans to franchise Yuppie Puppy. But he will  do so only if he can develop a system that will allow him to maintain quality control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sporn cites one of his most loyal customers, the writer David Halberstam, who, he said, told him: '' 'Joe, be careful.  Remember you're franchising real dogs, not hot dogs.' '' The advice ''stayed with me,'' he said, and added: ''These are little souls. These are our best friends. You can't just go for the money.''</p>
