        <p>THE RIVER KING</p>
        <p>By Alice Hoffman.</p>
        <p>324 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>G. P. Putnam's Sons. $23.95.</p>
        <p>We live in a time of retro movements and neo-Freudian psychology, in which looking to the past is a way we look to the future. So it's no surprise that the Gothic novel is a best-selling genre in our confessional era. The hallmarks of the Gothic -- curses, apparitions, wicked tyrants, desolate landscapes, destructive forces, demonic spirits -- are like manifestations of the traumas that make up our tell-all memoirs. Out of such fanciful transfigurations, Alice Hoffman has built a substantial -- and very popular -- body of work.</p>
        <p>''The River King,'' Hoffman's 14th novel, takes place in fictional Haddan, Mass., and at the nearby Haddan School, an exclusive establishment on the banks of the Haddan River, ''a muddy and precarious location that had proven disastrous from the start.'' Ever since its inception, the school has been a jealous rival of the village, but like most sibling conflicts, this one has been repressed -- only to resurface when Gus Pierce, a gawky freshman, drowns in the river. All signs point to murder, but with a little quid pro quo -- for saving the school's reputation, the town will get some cash -- suicide becomes the agreed-upon explanation. Yet one local policeman, the dreamy-looking Abel Grey, refuses to be deterred and begins to prowl for clues within Haddan's whitewashed walls.</p>
        <p>As in any genuine Gothic tale, there is the requisite romance: Grey, a man as fuzzy about commitment as his name would suggest, falls hard for a photography instructor named Betsy Chase, a woman with ''high cheekbones and dark, unpredictable hair'' who nourishes her secret passion for him even as she dutifully plans her wedding to fusty Eric Herman, a teacher of ancient history who's as maniacal about becoming department chairman as George Eliot's Casaubon was about finishing his ''Key to All Mythologies.'' The drama of Abel and Betsy's illicit affair mirrors the drama of Gus's mysterious death, and it's no coincidence that Grey is the able player in both cases. Assisted in his investigation by Gus's aggrieved ghost (the River King of the title), Grey also ardently pursues Betsy. If he really does get her -- my lips are sealed -- that would also bode well for relations between town and gown.</p>
        <p>With a Main Street, a drugstore soda fountain and a bar in whose parking lot ''half a dozen divorces . . . had reached a fevered pitch,'' Haddan could be any small town. Yet here the real world commingles with a surreal natural world -- roses perfume the January air and bobcats act like kittens, nursing with babies in their cradles. Human moods and actions reflect the vagaries of nature, proving that another Gothic device -- what college professors call the pathetic fallacy -- still flourishes in today's popular fiction.</p>
        <p>It can be hard to find an example of good old-fashioned storytelling these days, but storytelling, refreshingly, is Alice Hoffman's strength. Her tone is one of casual intimacy, and if her writing sometimes lapses into platitudes (''How unfortunate that love could not be taught or trained, like a seal or a dog''), you excuse it as you would the easy speech of a neighbor chatting to you over the backyard fence.</p>
        <p>But a good old-fashioned story needs good old-fashioned characters, and Hoffman populates Haddan with a supporting cast whose members are so numerous that she rarely has time to develop them beyond mere tag lines: the pharmacist, the soccer coach, the dean of students. Likewise, her main characters fail to evolve into the sometimes nuanced figures of her previous books; none approach the complexity of, say, March Murray of ''Here on Earth,'' a woman who makes excuses for and eventually escapes an abusive relationship.</p>
        <p>Midway through ''The River King,'' Hoffman interrupts her cultivation of the inner lives of Betsy Chase and Carlin Leander (a beautiful scholarship student from Florida who was Gus's only friend) to tend to the book's two policemen, the ''detached at worst and distant at best'' Abel Grey and Joey Tosh, a conventional male stereotype who contributes little to the novel other than financial and marital complaints. By the end, one thing is clear: it might take a well-populated village to raise a plot, but it takes three or four strong characters to keep that plot in motion.</p>
        <p>When much of what passes for originality in contemporary fiction is merely arch and alienating, and reading can feel like sitting next to someone at a dinner party who never learned how to tell a decent anecdote, it's clear why Hoffman is so successful. For a few hours, at least, you know that you'll be enjoying an ''entertainment,'' as Graham Greene used to call his more commercial novels. Spinning a solid tale is indeed a form of very practical magic. But it's another, impractical sort of magic that allows a writer to gain insight into human acts and motivations -- and that ultimately gives a story its second life in the reader's imagination. ''The River King'' is full of wonderfully and satisfyingly odd twists and turns, but its enchantments surrender themselves too easily and depart too soon.</p>
