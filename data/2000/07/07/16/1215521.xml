        <p>Review of Congressional race in Illinois's 15th District between State Repr Timothy V Johnson, Republican, and Mike Kelleher, Democratic challenger (S)</p>

        <p>Back in 1980, when he was one of the newer members of the Illinois House, State Representative Timothy V. Johnson, a Republican from the Champaign-Urbana area, rigged a paper clip so that it held the ''Yes'' voting button on his desk in the down position. When a picture of the clip hit the newspapers, he first denied installing it but later backtracked, saying such rigs were ''accepted practice'' in the legislature and enabled members to vote on legislation even when absent from the House chamber, especially at times when votes were called while members were meeting with constituents or working on other pressing matters.</p>
        <p>That explanation apparently satisfied voters in Mr. Johnson's district. He still represents it 20 years later.</p>

        <p>Back in 1980, when he was one of the newer members of the Illinois House, State Representative Timothy V. Johnson, a Republican from the Champaign-Urbana area, rigged a paper clip so that it held the ''Yes'' voting button on his desk in the down position. When a picture of the clip hit the newspapers, he first denied installing it but later backtracked, saying such rigs were ''accepted practice'' in the legislature and enabled members to vote on legislation even when absent from the House chamber, especially at times when votes were called while members were meeting with constituents or working on other pressing matters.</p>
        <p>That explanation apparently satisfied voters in Mr. Johnson's district. He still represents it 20 years later.</p>
        <p>But now he has his eye on a larger district, the 15th Congressional, which has an open seat this year, and the photo of the paper clip has come back to haunt him.</p>
        <p>His Democratic rival, Mike Kelleher, has dredged up the shot and contends it says much about Mr. Johnson's worthiness to serve. He has posted newspaper articles about it on the Web -- timspaperclip.com -- and is running ads about it.</p>
        <p>''It shows a pattern of behavior by Tim Johnson to avoid his responsibilities and violate the trust his constituents placed in him,'' Mr. Kelleher said last week. ''Voting is the reason you are elected, and he delegated that responsibility to a piece of office supply. This goes to character.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson says he is guilty of no wrongdoing and calls the resurrected picture and stories ''a silly little red herring'' raised by ''a desperate candidate who is far behind.''</p>
