        <p>A contributor to the New Jersey Diary for June 25 was shocked to realize that a prospective house painter, a man painting a fence in a park, was wearing a prison uniform.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A contributor to the New Jersey Diary for June 25 was shocked to realize that a prospective house painter, a man painting a fence in a park, was wearing a prison uniform. I found the story and the accompanying illustration a sad commentary on the tear in social fabric of the United States in the year 2000.</p>
        <p>I too have seen prison laborers in the parks. Their presence reminds me of the period during the Great Depression when many parks were built by the youth of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The C.C.C. provided work skills, a modest income and a place to stay out of trouble during the 1930's. In my own youth in the 1940's and until fairly recently, park maintenance was a respectable job that paid sufficient income for men and women to support families.</p>
        <p>Today we have reverted to models from prior centuries -- a class of indentured servants who will be freed when they have served their time. We have created a prison-industrial complex that uses the labor of inmates to depress the wages of state-employed free labor while supporting the building and maintenance of prisons and the wages of guards and prison staff.</p>
        <p>Some better response is needed.</p>
