        <p>I'm mixed, Colombian and Mexican, and I had a mixture of friends growing up in Anchorage. I wasn't trying to be a role model in the N.H.L., but I can see some people might look at me as ''that minority guy'' playing hockey. Every athlete is a role model. Kids want to imitate us. I used to want to be Jordan and Bonds and Griffey.</p>
        <p>I'm proud of the name on my jersey. There are a lot of ethnic groups in the N.H.L. I think we're the most diverse league in all of sports. On our team alone we have five countries represented, I think. Other teams have more. We also have a lot of Natives in the league from different tribes. I've never seen anyone say something to another player because of his race. The league makes players go to diversity and sensitivity training before the season. I think we're the only league where it's required. When we had our team diversity training this year, everyone thought it was really good.</p>
        <p>No one wants to be called names, especially if it's something negative about where they're from. So I think people should just keep in mind that everyone's different. That's the whole basis for why we live in America. But some people think I'm weird because I'm from Alaska. They don't think Alaska is even part of America. But that's cool. I like being from Alaska.</p>
