        <p>Not since Kermit and Kukla (Fran and Ollie's friend) has a puppet been so popular. The Sock Puppet became a media star last year as a puppyish mascot in television commercials for Pet.com, a pet-products Web site. The mutt on a mitt has since been a guest on morning chat shows and has floated down Broadway as a 36-foot balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. But the humans at Pets.com were not prepared for the aftermath of the puppet's spot broadcast during the Super Bowl in January. Traffic on the site that day more than doubled from the previous Sunday's. Some 10,000 Sock fans a month were asking by e-mail and phone, Does the Sock Puppet do weddings, birthday parties, interviews? And most of all, Where can I buy one? Fans were disappointed to learn that the Sock Puppet, who is rumored to have escaped from a washing machine, was not available for sale, rent or bar mitzvahs. No longer. In February, Pets.com auctioned one of the puppets on Amazon.com Auctions for $21,100, which was donated to Pets.commitment, a philanthropic program. And this month, the Sock Puppet went on sale online and off, for $20, along with apparel, toys and other licensed merchandise.</p>
