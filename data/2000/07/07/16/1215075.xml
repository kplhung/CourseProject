        <p>WHEN Mount St. Helens erupted early on the morning of May 18, 1980, the devastation was immense. In the span of a few seconds, 1,312 feet of rock were cleaved off the top of the mountain, and the flow of mud, lava and boulders covered the earth 20 miles away. Dozens of square miles were transformed into a barren, burned gray moonscape, and 57 people and thousands of animals perished.</p>
        <p>Today, 20 years later, nature has rebounded in surprising ways on the mountain, in southwest Washington State. There are some fledgling plants, trees and berry bushes, most from seeds reintroduced to the area by wandering elk.</p>
        <p>Other animals -- frogs, salamanders, beavers -- have come back, too. And while the area still shows evidence of breath taking incineration, there are now literally hundreds of research plots, where scientists are carefully chronicling the amazing process, known as recolonization, under which nature is springing back to life.</p>
        <p>The delicate question is, How much of a tourist attraction should all this be?</p>
        <p>Many tourism boosters in the area are lobbying for greater visitor access to  the mountain, formally known as the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. Among other things, they'd like to extend the main road that snakes through the monument to provide access from the east. (The road currently provides access from Interstate 5 to the west, ending at a federal observatory near the crater.) And they have talked of marketing the mountain and the surrounding area as a multiday vacation destination with hiking, camping, biking and kayaking -- not, as most visitors make it now, a detour of a half-day or so to learn about the volcano and gape at nature's awesome power.</p>
        <p>Whether such an effort to expand tourism could succeed is an open question, and some scientists say that because of the fragility of the recovering landscape it's best to keep an informal lid on the number of visitors by holding off on such promotions.</p>
        <p>The most immediate issue concerning tourism centers on the main visitors center, known as Silver Lake. It is a few miles off the Interstate near Castle Rock, Wash., and is thus a popular spot for motorists between Portland and Seattle to stop and learn about the blast. (The Spirit Lake Memorial Highway leads from there to the mountain, about 40 miles away.)</p>
        <p>Last winter, citing budget cutbacks, the Forest Service closed the center for a few months. But when it announced in March that the center would not reopen at all this year, local officials were angry, citing the upcoming 20th anniversary. Under pressure from the state's Congressional delegation, the Forest Service agreed to reopen the center for the year, but its future remains uncertain, and the federal government is even considering privatization. This is largely because of shortfalls in the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program, which the Congress started four years ago with the aim of making some federal recreation  sites self-sufficient. The program generated about $2.3 million at Mount St. Helens in 1998, but last year, when poor weather reduced the number of visitors, the total dropped to about $1.4 million, not enough to make the monument self-sustaining.</p>
        <p>There are four other visitors centers of various sizes around the monument, two operated by the Forest Service, one by Cowlitz County, and one by Weyerhaeuser, the timber company. The official total for visitors to the monument last year was 1.5 million, but that might overstate the case a bit: the Forest Service counts someone who stops at all three of their visitors centers as three visitors.</p>
        <p>At the mountain, a network of good hiking trails has been formed, carefully laid out not to interfere with the regeneration taking place all around. These include the Ptarmigan Trail, which leads to the summit (8,363 feet these days), and the 28-mile Loowit Trail, which essentially circles the volcano and provides a fascinating glimpse of the destruction along with some lands that were, given the vagaries of the winds and the lava flow that day, relatively untouched.</p>
        <p>Access to the crater itself remains forbidden, with good reason: it's still steaming in there.</p>
        <p>In the visitors centers, old photographs depict the cheerful bygone days, with a lodge and the beautifully snowcapped cone of a peak, a startling contrast to today's desolate landscape. The lodge lies buried below hundreds of feet of debris from avalanches and mud flow, and the peak is a gaping, jagged shadow of its former self.</p>
        <p>Camping sites are available in the monument, with prices ranging from $11 to $20, according to a spokeswoman at the visitors center. The main information number is (360) 247-3900. On the Web, information  can be retrieved at www.fs.fed.us./gpnf/ mshnvm.</p>
        <p>Two other sites with tourism information about the area are www.mountsthelens .com and www.cowlitzcounty.org/tourism. Or telephone the Mount St. Helens Information Resource Center, (360) 274-3406.</p>
