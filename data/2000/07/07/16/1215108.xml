        <p>Hynes: When the governor appointed me special prosecutor in the Howard Beach tragedy, the first call I made was to Vernon, and I said to him I wanted to have an opportunity to speak to his client and to Alton Maddox's client, who were the victims in this case. And I went over to his office with a team of lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mason: This was in 1986. In terms of dealing with civil rights and what we would call race cases, it was akin to practicing law in a war zone. There would be great outrage in the black community, but almost invariably those cases would not be prosecuted.</p>

        <p>Hynes: When the governor appointed me special prosecutor in the Howard Beach tragedy, the first call I made was to Vernon, and I said to him I wanted to have an opportunity to speak to his client and to Alton Maddox's client, who were the victims in this case. And I went over to his office with a team of lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mason: This was in 1986. In terms of dealing with civil rights and what we would call race cases, it was akin to practicing law in a war zone. There would be great outrage in the black community, but almost invariably those cases would not be prosecuted.</p>
        <p>Hynes: The impression I was getting, there wasn't a lot of serious interest in prosecuting these kind of cases.</p>
        <p>Mason: So, when Joe [Hynes's nickname] called and said, ''I want to meet with your client,'' I mean, I almost fell out of my chair. That was very, very unprecedented, in the midst of the political atmosphere at that time. This was before Ed Koch had reformed. You know, this was not the new Ed Koch.</p>
        <p>Hynes: I had been up at Eastover, which at the time was a place for modest Irish lawyers and their families to go, and I got a phone call from Larry Kurlander, and he said: ''Have you been following the Howard Beach case? The governor may want you to take a look at it.'' And it was the way he said it I immediately called my office in the city and said, ''You better start gearing up and send me some stuff on it.'' And I was watching the TV reports. But in the middle of the deliberations, the phone rang in my borrowed suite in Queens, and it was Kurlander, and he said, ''The governor wants to know if you're taking a look at Tawana Brawley.'' I said: ''I'm in the middle of this trial. He ain't doin' this again.'' Then that was the end of it to me.</p>
        <p>Mason: You know, with Tawana, we had a trial, and the jury rendered whatever you can call what they rendered. I've often wondered what would have been the outcome if Joe Hynes had not been so exhausted from Howard Beach.</p>
        <p>Hynes: I have my own theory about the case, which I'm not going to share with you. Something happened to that child. But any time you have this kind of case, you know, where you have Mr. Louima being violated, or the question of race, you're going to have a problem.</p>
