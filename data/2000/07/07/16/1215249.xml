        <p>SUSAN PLINER thinks small, and she is not ashamed to admit it.</p>
        <p>When she teaches writing, she wants her students to see a leaf, not a tree; a fern, not a forest. ''My middle name is close observation,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She had students practice what she preaches at a retreat last Sunday, sponsored by the Hudson Valley Writers' Center.</p>
        <p>A lot of self-conscious writing habits fall by the wayside, she said, after someone spends five or six minutes writing about a single wildflower or a bit of moss. ''It distracts you from the normal garbage.''</p>
        <p>It's a technique that joins two great passions: writing (her poetry has been published in The Kenyon Review, The Paris Review and The American Poetry Review), gardening (she used to volunteer at Wave Hill in the Bronx and runs ''The Eye of the Poet'' reading series there).</p>
        <p>And so on a sunny July Sunday, Ms. Pliner and her students headed outdoors, visiting the Rockefeller State Park Preserve and nearby Rock Hall to see what they could see. Here are samples of their work:</p>
        <p>Paper light ferns, each set of leaves in place, have pushed their way up past sturdier growth. Heads tipped to the side, they catch every breeze when other leaves are still.</p>
        <p>Across the path in the woods, an undulating branch, ripped open long ago, still rests against the trunk. Smooth now, its wood maps brown shapes against a wheat background and casts a jagged shadow like a puppet shark.</p>
        <p>Closer to the river, three dead trees tower above oak and beech, the first gnarled in thick convolutions of dark wood. Its top branches stretch in acrobatic poses against the sky, one last time in style. To the right a leafless tree holds its dead branches as if next spring still promised bud. The third holds a rigid winter silhouette against the summer breeze. Some green vine has made the tree its home and wound its leaves around and round the tree until dark bark is gone.</p>
        <p>Through the meadows to the old estate foundation grey stone is cracked enough to show a wall display of fern. The grasses around the wall are a potpourri of green and reddish brown, dotted with clumps of milkweed, patches of clover and tiny dots of white morning glories open to the clouds and sun until something blocks their view. Then round horns fold in on themselves like muted trumpets, pink veins spread across this shape shifter. White light is gone.</p>
        <p>ALICE FEELEY  Elmsford</p>
        <p>Matted hair. A toupe of green. Tougher than it looks, but doesn't put up a long fight if I want to pull it like a clump of hair. Under the tangle -- more moss. Velvet, of course, the dark green of expensive couch velour. Soft, dry, easily picked up -- weightless! rootless! coasting on a crust of dirt!</p>
        <p>And under the moss, that brown crumble of soil. Bran grains. Micropellets.</p>
        <p>Cover up the layers. Moss on soil. Green tangle on moss. Sentry ragweed stands at the edges, at attention, barely vibrating in the low breeze.</p>
        <p>LISA SCHWARZBAUM  Manhattan</p>
        <p>From a small patch of moss sprouts a double blade of grass, newborn, and thin as dental floss. An inch away, a dry, beige double blade of grass. Tired. And between the opposing blades of grass, a delicate stem of multiple leaves, small as a baby's teardrops.</p>
        <p>PAT ROSS  Scarsdale</p>
        <p>Growing closer to the ground than any of the spriggy things on stems around it. Tiny furry clusters of green hug that soil beneath it, shimmering a little, kind of like stringy, caterpillar coils of velvet in the softest sunlight. A kind of chenille, maybe. Like a raggy scrap of fabric, it has no clean, definable shape but sprawls out across a clump of the dirt trail, spreading soft green in a patch the size of my hand. There must be a center to it. Maybe the moss itself is the center, catching in it bits of pebble, a sparkle of a moving brown ant, dead leaves, dying leaves. I have the urge to shake out this bedspread.</p>
        <p>BETTY MING LIU  Hastings-on-Hudson</p>
        <p>At the path near the lake. The Canadian geese eating the greens. I thought I saw a dead bird on the moss. When I got close, it was a broken branch with its sharp edges looking like the tail feathers of the geese. Its brown body the same color as the broken branch. Lily pads mixed in with the algae. The white flowers on the lily pad. The geese swimming near the broken branch. Look again.</p>
        <p>ELAINE YOUNG  Purchase</p>
        <p>Susan Pliner will conduct another retreat at Rockefeller State Park Preserve on July 30. The fee is $95 or $85 for members of the center. For registration or more information, call (914) 332-5953. The center's Web site is www.writerscenter.org.</p>
