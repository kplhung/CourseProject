        <p>In a sure sign that White Plains is experiencing an economic recovery, the vacancy rate for commercial real estate space in the city's central business district fell to 16.9 percent from 26.9 percent in June of 1999.</p>
        <p>Countywide, at the end of the second quarter, the availability rate fell to 12.8 percent, compared with 16.4 percent for the same period a year ago, according to the Insignia/ESG Midyear Commercial Report released last week.</p>

        <p>In a sure sign that White Plains is experiencing an economic recovery, the vacancy rate for commercial real estate space in the city's central business district fell to 16.9 percent from 26.9 percent in June of 1999.</p>
        <p>Countywide, at the end of the second quarter, the availability rate fell to 12.8 percent, compared with 16.4 percent for the same period a year ago, according to the Insignia/ESG Midyear Commercial Report released last week.</p>
        <p>The improvement, both in White Plains and throughout the county, is attributed to the growth of existing businesses, as well as increasing interest by high-tech and Internet-related companies relocating or expanding.</p>
        <p>Also, in the last six months, the county's Industrial Development Agency has approved financial incentives (including loans, tax exemptions and abatements, or interest savings) to some major companies, including Metromedia, Greenwich Technology Partners and Heineken U.S.A.</p>
