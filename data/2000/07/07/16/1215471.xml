        <p>Haitian officials say they will stand by the results of their recent elections despite threats from international donors to suspend aid because of a vote-counting method they deemed unfair and unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Asselin Charles, a spokesman for Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis, said outside countries had misunderstood the counting method and that the results could not be changed because elections are the responsibility of the Provisional Electoral Council.</p>
        <p>''The government feels that democracy is a question of institutions, and the government cannot interfere,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The impasse began after the first round of elections on May 21, when the electoral council gave a near-total sweep to the candidates of Lavalas Family, the political party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Electoral observers criticized the council's tallying method, which, instead of requiring candidates to win with an absolute majority, counted only the votes received by the top four finishers in each race. The count thus ignored many votes received by minor candidates.</p>
        <p>The disputed count gave Lavalas 18 of the 19 Senate seats in the first round. Leon Manus, the president of the electoral council, resigned after the first round and fled the country, fearing for his life after accusing the government of pressuring him to approve questionable results. When the Haitian government refused to recalculate the first-round results, the Organization of American States withdrew its election observers for the runoff last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Organization of American States, the European Community and the United States have been considering what steps to take, including a suspension of aid, if the Haitian government seats a new legislature whose legitimacy is questioned. Some $500 million in foreign aid has remained untapped for several years because of a political deadlock that has left this country without a Parliament since January of last year.</p>
        <p>Despite the threats, Haitian officials have refused to budge, and this week they began to swear in mayors and local council members. Electoral officials said the vote was fair, and that more than 30 percent of the electorate voted. Opposition parties, who boycotted the runoff, said many polling places were ghost towns while others were reportedly the targets of armed thugs.</p>
        <p>''The C.E.P.'s mission is to run elections transparently and fairly,'' said Roland Sainristil, the spokesman for the Provisional Electoral Council, using its French acronym. ''This is what has been done on May 21, and this is what we have continued to do, to put in place democratic institutions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Charles echoed the recent statements of the prime minister when he said that any suspension of aid would have little impact, since Haiti had already been grappling with a lack of international aid in recent years.</p>
        <p>''We are ready to use our internal resources to implement national programs that the government feels are necessary,'' he said. ''Eventually, the international community will keep explaining what is happening until Haiti is understood by all.''</p>
        <p>Critics of the recent elections said they already understood what was happening: a consolidation of power by Lavalas that would culminate in Mr. Aristide's election in November. They alleged that the voting irregularities were carried out by Lavalas because it was unsure of its support, even though it was the only party with any sustained campaign presence.</p>
        <p>Protests by opposition parties outside of the capital have resulted in arrests by police. Calling the new legislature ''illegitimate,'' they feared worse times ahead.</p>
        <p>''We believe this is a totally irresponsible attitude,'' said Danile Supplice, a Senate candidate for the Espace de Concertation party. ''What is going to happen is that Haiti is going to pay for this. We cannot afford in the year 2000 to isolate ourselves. It does not make any sense.''</p>
