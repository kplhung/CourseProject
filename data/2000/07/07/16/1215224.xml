        <p>TALENT knows no age limit. Older residents of Rockland County prove that each year when they display their works in Spring Valley in the exhibition called ''Golden Harvest: Senior Art Celebration,'' sponsored by the Arts Council of Rockland. The oil-on-canvas painting ''Skyland,'' left, is by Olga Porumbaru. Mary Bahr poses with her handcrafted teddy bear, above, and Mary Evelyn O'Conner, below left, who is represented elsewhere in the exhibit, pauses while examining her colleagues' contributions. In the group photograph below, Mark Judelson, the director of the Arts Council, standing on the left in the back, is joined by Helen Brady, left, Olga Porumbaru, Alfred Hill, Mary Evelyn O'Conner and Mary Bahr. The works are on display through July 25.</p>
