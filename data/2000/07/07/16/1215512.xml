        <p>In this quadrennial year of elections and an Olympiad, there are constants in the air. Politicians and athletes alike will chase long-held dreams of cheers and glory. Great swatches of television time will be devoted to outcomes both foregone and unpredictable. And, for the fourth consecutive running of the Summer Olympics, the Star class sailor Mark Reynolds will be prospecting for gold.</p>
        <p>When it comes to Stars, literally and figuratively, the 44-year-old Reynolds knows the ropes. To the native of San Diego, Star boats have been a common thread in the fabric of his existence. His father, Jim, who crewed for local Star legends like Malin Burnham and Dennis Conner, dragged his son to his first regatta, off Newport Beach, when he was 4.</p>
        <p>Mark Reynolds grew up with a tiller in one hand, a mainsheet in the other. He started like many junior sailors, with a string of one-design sailboats: Sabots, Lasers, a Flying Dutchman. ''Then, in the early 80's,'' he said. ''I got serious with Stars.''</p>
        <p>Did he ever. In the years that followed, Reynolds roamed the world collecting passport stamps and Star class sailing medals. He nabbed a gold medal at the Goodwill Games in Estonia in 1986, and followed that up with a silver at the Olympics in Pusan, South Korea, in 1988. Then, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, Reynolds won Olympic gold.</p>
        <p>In Savannah, Ga., the Olympic sailing venue in 1996, Reynolds posted a rare, substandard performance and finished eighth. But now he's back, with a new crewman -- 46-year-old Magnus Liljedahl, a native Swede who gained his American citizenship in the early 90's, and who has replaced Reynolds's longtime partner, Hal Haenel.</p>
        <p>In April, Reynolds and Liljedahl breezed to victory in the Olympic trials off San Francisco, winning 9 of 14 races. The pair followed that up with a resounding triumph while vanquishing 111 other crews in the Star World Championships, in May, on the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>''As it worked out we had a little extra speed edge on everybody,'' Reynolds said. ''It's been a really good year so far.''</p>
        <p>The Star, a hard-chined, 22-foot-8-inch keel boat, has an all-up weight of just under 1,500 pounds -- 900 of which are stashed low in its ballast bulb. It also features a massive mainsail that propels it beautifully in light wind, which is one of the reasons the boat has been so popular in San Diego, where other Star luminaries like Lowell North, Gerry Driscoll and Vince Brun have also reigned. But with its size, the mainsail can be a handful in heavier air.</p>
        <p>To counterbalance that big main requires beef, and the relatively compact, circular Liljedahl, at 6-1 and 255 pounds, fills the bill. He is also the perfect complement to the more angular, 6-3, 200-pound Reynolds. In silhouette, the pair could be mistaken for wide receiver Jerry Rice and nose tackle Jerry Ball.</p>
        <p>''Having a big guy hanging out and getting his weight out as far as he physically can will help keep the boat more upright and going fast through the water,'' Reynolds said. ''The harder you hike, the faster you go.''</p>
        <p>If Reynolds is the current embodiment of the quintessential Star sailor, it's also because, by profession, he's a sailmaker whose business is crafting the aerodynamic wings on which the fastest Stars fly. But that also means he is sometimes in the unenviable position of sharing the equivalent of state secrets.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you find a little edge you don't want to tell people about,'' he said.''But one reason people buy my sails is because they get my advice on how to set them up. The only way I can afford to keep sailing is by selling good sails. If I started hiding stuff, it'd shut me down.''</p>
        <p>In the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Reynolds will not be contending with a 100-plus-boat fleet, as he did at the world championships. The Olympic Star class quota is only 18 boats, but it is a highly competitive field that includes the Canadian Ross MacDonald; the hometown favorite, Australia's own, Colin Beashel; and the Brazilian Torben Grael, back to Stars after his stint aboard Prada in the last America's Cup.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of depth there,'' Reynolds said. ''Beashel's been consistent for years and he came real close to winning the gold last time. MacDonald's a great sailor, and Grael has a new boat with a little different hull shape, so it's possible that could give him a little edge.''</p>
        <p>But Reynolds, on his accustomed mission in an Olympic year, likes his chances. ''We've been going well,'' he said. ''Barring any catastrophes I think we have a good shot at winning an Olympic medal. We're aiming for the gold one.''</p>
