      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>My first extended contact with black people came at the age of 50, at a data-processing job at an insurance firm. There were 15 or 18 black women working there who ranged in age from their late 20's to their late 50's. Before that, race was something I had never thought about, so I expected these co-workers to be the same as any others. I was shocked by the vulgarity of their speech, their loudness and their inappropriate behavior. These were nice, capable women individually who as a group acted like teenagers. During the six years I worked there, I found myself increasingly uncomfortable around them and even came to resent them because their behavior wouldn't have been tolerated had they been anything but black.</p>

        <p>I used to be in favor of affirmative action. Now I would consider myself a racist. I avoid black people and the places that cater to them. I am sorry that I feel this way, but one can't always choose how one feels, however unpleasant.</p>
