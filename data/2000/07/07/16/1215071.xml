        <p>A MUCH-NEEDED little antiquities museum has been created in Beijing by a most improbable source: a giant state corporation that was long notorious for its global weapons sales and was until recently a branch of the People's Liberation Army.</p>
        <p>The new Poly Art Museum's attractions include its manageable size -- for now, just one large room stocked with choice ancient bronzes and a small side room with a few sublime Buddhist statues -- and its highly selective approach to acquisition. The brazenly Epicurean philosophy is detailed in a brochure in which the museum resolves ''to eschew quantity and comprehensiveness, confining ourselves rather to the pursuit of the exquisite, the rare and the fine.''</p>
        <p>I don't know what serious scholars might think of this approach, but for this borderline antiquities-philistine who nods off at the sight of long cases filled with objects, the museum offered unexpected delights.</p>
        <p>True to its word, the Poly museum is exhibiting no more than about 100 objects, each with some wonderful aspect and each given plenty of space, with labels both in Chinese and in English.</p>
        <p>Situated in an unprepossessing office building at a busy intersection, the museum had kept such a low profile after its opening last year that few even knew of its existence. But in early May, it suddenly thrust itself into the news when it spent $4 million to buy three bronze animal heads at auctions in Hong Kong. The heads had been part of a zodiac fountain at the Old Summer Palace near Beijing, designed by a European Jesuit in the mid-18th century, and were looted by French and English troops when they razed the estate in 1860.</p>
        <p>The pillaging of the Emperor's summer home was a humiliating moment in Chinese history, and this spring, when Sotheby's and Christie's put these bronze heads and a similarly stolen vase on auction in Hong Kong, nationalistic voices were raised in objection. The Poly Museum helped save the day, buying the heads at what many considered an extravagant price of $4 million and announcing their ''return to the motherland.''</p>
        <p>This ''political purchase'' was a departure for the museum, which has focused on far older relics, and the pieces themselves are more important as historical symbols than as art. But with the enormous public interest that was generated by the dispute, the museum is making space for its new monkey, ox and tiger heads.</p>
        <p>The purchases were in line with one part of the museum's mission: to bring back Chinese treasures that have been smuggled or sold out of the country. The parent company, the China Poly Group Corporation,  has officially separated from the military and now describes itself as a huge government-owned conglomerate involved in real estate, industry, high technology and tourism. With this museum it is trying out what is a new concept for China: corporate philanthropy.</p>
        <p>The company has spent untold millions to build a collection from scratch over the last two years, mainly in Hong Kong and Taiwan, where newly discovered relics tend to appear on the market after being smuggled out of China. Some of the most stunning bronzes on display were almost certainly unearthed and smuggled out in just the past several years, museum officials believe.</p>
        <p>Because the museum is reversing, ever so slightly, the flood of relics leaving the country, it was able to enlist one of China's premier archaeologists as a consultant: Yu Weichao, who recently retired as head of the National Museum of Chinese History in Beijing.</p>
        <p>''It's not a very cheerful job, buying these items back from overseas,'' Mr. Yu said.  ''But I think the Chinese people will be happy to know that at least we're getting them back.''</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. Yu gave me a quick tour of the exhibition, barely containing his enthusiasm as his eyes almost fondled each piece.</p>
        <p>The most rare and valuable single bronze, he said -- and I would add a most fascinating object to scrutinize -- is the ornate bronze ceremonial wine vessel prominently displayed near the entrance, with the face of a deity and various birds and other figures and a gorgeous blue-green patina. Unusually well preserved and made with exceptional skill, it dates from the western Zhou period, from the 11th to 8th centuries B.C., and was probably unearthed in Shaanxi province in the recent past, Mr. Yu said. The museum bought it from a Hong Kong dealer.</p>
        <p>MR. YU dwelled lovingly on a set of eight ritual bronze bells, graduated in size. Inside each bell is a narrow groove, hollowed out to perfect the tone, and depending where it is  struck, each has two clear tones. An inscription in ancient Chinese characters resembles pictographs much more than modern Chinese writing; it is fun to examine in itself. The inscription commemorates the previous three generations of the family of a nobleman who had the bells made and used them to make music some 2,800 years ago in what is now Shaanxi.</p>
        <p>My eyes were drawn to a gold-covered long-necked dragon head, which around 2,000 years ago formed part of the frame for a royal canopy and offered an elegant contrast to the many bronze and bronze-with-copper-inlay vessels. ''My feeling is simply that this is an exquisitely beautiful piece,'' Mr. Yu said, dropping all pretense of archaeological objectivity.</p>
        <p>In a small side room, the museum displays a few of the stone carvings of Buddhist figures that have been unearthed in Shandong province over the last quarter century, part of an extraordinary find known as the Qingzhou sculptures, after a county at the center of the excavations. Stolen examples of these serene and graceful figures, created during the northern Wei dynasty in the sixth century, have started appearing in museums and collections abroad, but the Poly Art Museum collected its examples  inside China.</p>
        <p>For now, museum officials say, they plan to keep building their collections of bronzes and stone carvings, and may soon branch into ceramics and add another exhibition hall.</p>
        <p>''We're only one company, so there are only so many things we can buy,'' said Ma Baoping, assistant director of the museum and a former army officer with a nose for art. ''It's beyond us to buy every stolen object that comes up for sale, and I hope that other Chinese companies and collectors, including overseas Chinese collectors, will join with us to help bring these treasures back into Chinese hands.''</p>
        <p>The museum is on the second floor of the Poly Plaza commercial building, 14 Dong zhimen Nandajie, at the intersection of Dongzhimen Avenue with the Second Ring Road, across from the Swissotel. For some months to come, it will be open only on Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is $2.40; telephone (86-10) 6500-8117.</p>
