        <p>In the locker room, people might make jokes about ''the white girls,'' but it's always in fun. When I was in college, the basketball players would sit together in the cafeteria, and since some were African-American, it was natural that their African-American friends would come sit with us. So I probably met more African-Americans than I would have otherwise. We sometimes joked about race. I remember one person saying, ''We get perms to straighten our hair, and you get perms to do the opposite.'' Sometimes, it's not until you hear it from the outside that you think about it. I hear my teammates saying, ''A taxi's not going to pick me up, it's going to pick up the white lady five feet away,'' but they laugh about it. I was sunbathing once and an African-American teammate said, ''Rebecca, you better not spend any more time in the sun or you won't be able to get a cab.'' My attorney is a black gentleman, and sometimes in a restaurant he'll say, ''People are glaring at us.'' I'll look up, and there might be a couple at another table looking at us disapprovingly. I'm hopeful about race, but I think there's a long way to go.</p>
