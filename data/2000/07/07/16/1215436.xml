        <p>I ask Jack Welch what could possibly make his book worth $7.1 million.</p>
        <p>Is there any sex in it?</p>
        <p>''Very little,'' he says, laughing.</p>
        <p>Authors used to be lavished with money for writing scintillating love scenes. But the Valley of the Dolls has been replaced by the Silicon Valley of the dot-coms. The sexiest thing in America is no longer sex. It's money.</p>
        <p>Last week, Harry Potter had to make room for some adult fantasies: not about conjuring up pin cushions from hedgehogs, but about conjuring up cash -- lots and lots of cash.</p>
        <p>Call it the literature of lucre, the Bildungsroman of the bottom line. First Random House gave Robert Rubin, the investment banker and former treasury secretary who masterminded the new culture of wealth, $3.3 million for his story. Then Time Warner ponied up $7.1 million to Mr. Welch, the chairman of G.E., who has been described by Fortune Magazine as ''the leading management revolutionary of the century.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch's book auction broke the record for a nonfiction book. It was $4 million more than Paula Barbieri got for describing life with O.J., and half a million or so more than either Colin Powell got for his heroic saga or the pope got for writing about spirituality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch, raised in a good Irish Catholic family in Salem, Mass., was a little embarrassed that he trumped the pope.</p>
        <p>Calling Friday night from the locker room after a golf tournament, he confided: ''I got an e-mail from a friend about the bidding that said, 'You should have cut it short at the pope. Now you're dead. Didn't your altar boy days teach you that?' ''</p>
        <p>Then again, Mr. Welch -- who says he will give all the earnings from his book to charity -- did have the same agent as the pope. His literary agent was Mark Reiter at Mark McCormack's International Management Group. Mr. McCormack, a prominent sports agent, handled the promotion of some of the pope's trips abroad.</p>
        <p>We may have a numbing presidential contest between a couple of beta males, two pampered scions of famous families whose paths were laid out for them.</p>
        <p>But ''Neutron Jack'' is ready to spill all his alpha secrets. ''This guy is the Vince Lombardi of business,'' says John Huey, the Fortune editor. The stock price of G.E. from the time the 64-year-old took over the company 20 years ago is a vertiginous vertical line that has made him the most widely aped and studied executive in the land.</p>
        <p>Publishers, who see the pilots of the new turbo-charged economy as the hot celebrities, are clearly hoping for another Iacocca.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch says he hopes his Scout's-oath style of advice will be uplifting -- ''Be true to yourself, be honest with others, say what you think, go with your instincts, teach people that you can stretch and grow in ways you never thought possible.</p>
        <p>''It's like a dinner party with 12 people. You bring as many intellects together as you can and then take the best ideas out of each. The leader who gets the most ideas from the most sources will have the most success.''</p>
        <p>Just as Bob Rubin has been mentioned as a Democratic vice-presidential prospect, Donald Trump used to say he might have chosen Jack Welch.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Welch, who says he is ''a Republican fiscally but a Democrat on many social issues,'' demurs. ''I don't touch politics,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''In government, the best ideas don't always win. The president has to deal with Congress. In government, you're always compromising. You sell out on some principle and get something else for it. In business, you're not. You can be totally free. In a company, we have the luxury of being able to remove values we don't like.''</p>
        <p>He's not worried about the dot-com bubble bursting. ''I think we've handled the shakeout quite well,'' he says. ''There's no new economy. It's the same old economy with new technology. We get rid of some of the numbing, boring jobs and make society better and more creative.''</p>
        <p>He rejects the notion that our national fixation on money and easy millions is unhealthy. He thinks America has grown more like the earnest 50's -- when housewives were snapping up G.E.'s new-fangled appliances -- than the greed-is-good 80's.</p>
        <p>''The young kids we're hiring today are focused and excited,'' he says. ''They believe in hard work and giving back to the community and in having balanced lives. I don't see more greed or less greed now. A lot of people have participated in this market. It's not confined to a narrow group of fat cats. The boats have risen everywhere.''</p>
