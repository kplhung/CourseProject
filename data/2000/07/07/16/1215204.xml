        <p>THREE adolescent girls, down front on a blanket, by turns raptly attentive and gesticulating in mimicry of the actors, put on a free-flowing show of their own at the opening outdoors of ''The Comedy of Errors'' by Fleetwood Stage at Wildcliff here.</p>
        <p>Swaying and bouncing to the calypso rhythms of Shakespeare, tropically conceived, the girls were in sync with the words, the music and the cast. They giggled and craned  their necks to follow the jesting players up the aisles and into the woods.</p>
        <p>If the intended merriment, tumbling onto the greenery from the makeshift stage, matched the exuberance of these youngsters, what a mad and wonderful night of interactive revelry it could have been.</p>
        <p>So what if one of the enthusiasts was Ginny Arlt, the 11-year-old daughter of Lewis Arlt, the company's producing director? Her blithe effusions, the high spirits of her 11-year-old stepsister, Rebecca DiBlasi, and of Rachael Seiden, 10, seemed spontaneous, convincing and, to one in need of reaffirmation, an essential diversion. Here are the very models of cheerleaders for the arts. Who needs a laugh track when they are spreading joy?</p>
        <p>Not that their joy spread to most of the other people on blankets or in lawn chairs, some of whom packed up and left.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arlt's streamlined rendering of Shakespeare's shortest play is neither time conserving nor audience friendly, even though he pared it down to 90 minutes with 8 actors instead of 20 or more.</p>
        <p>Given the fact that the director truly has the gift of a wondrous setting -- overlooking the Sound -- he perversely draws the curtains to obliterate it. Imagine buying a condo with a river view and putting up a partition to shut out the water. At least the sounds of nature could not be silenced. On an invigoratingly cool summer night, the wind blew and the leaves rustled.</p>
        <p>Even though the God-painted scenery comes with the terrain, Joseph J. Egan designed an unsightly backdrop with random accouterments, like a thatched roof. Now there's hubris. Mr. Egan takes a costume credit, too, coming up with Hawaii-drab shirts, a few sarongs, straw derbies and other standard issue thrift-shop threads. One waits for a rush of wind to sway a flap of rear curtain to see a patch of blue Sound.</p>
        <p>Yes, there is a play to be done, though it is not the play being undone by Fleetwood's resident company, with its pervasive stock recitation-type droning or singsong locutions. Say simply that the elderly Aegeon's  first-scene monolgue, at long last grinding to a halt with the lines,  ''Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss . . . To tell sad stories of my own mishaps'' is a dire foretelling.</p>
        <p>''The Comedy of Errors'' abounds in mistaken identities and other confusions, and no one, not even the audience, gets it all sorted out until  the end when two sets of twins appear side by side. Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus, identical twin brothers, sons of Aegeon but unknown to each other, both have servants named Dromio, who are also identical twin brothers.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Arlt's conceit, or budgetary constraint, to cast one actor as two brothers named Antipholus, and one actor as two servants named Dromio. That allows cardboard cutouts to be brought out at the end, but  it does not work, neither in the end nor throughout. It is safe to say that  many people simply do not know what is going on; it is also reasonable to say that a synopsis in the program would be preferable to the producing director's generic justification of Shakespeare's timelessness and ''how well he understood the human psyche.''</p>
        <p>By now, Shakespeare's ''unruly boys'' have inspired stagings in all kinds of updated modes, incorporating the clowning, cartwheels and juggling of the Flying Karamazov Brothers in a circus-like 1987 Lincoln Center free-for-all to Off Broadway's ''Bomb-itty of Errors,'' a hip-hop version in rap verse last season. The Broadway musical had a classic to go with it (''The Boys From Syracuse'' by Rodgers and Hart in 1938 as well as a one-night flop (''Oh, Brother!'' set in the Persian Gulf in 1981).</p>
        <p>But the mauling by Fleetwood is sadly toneless, more erroneous than comic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arlt has talked about doing ''The Tempest'' in this perfect setting, a vision that could inspire an atoning production. Maybe next year. In the meantime, pray for speedy winds. You can't expect those ebullient girls to show up every night.</p>
        <p>''The Comedy of Errors'' at Fleetwood Stage, 44 Wildcliff Drive, New Rochelle. Performances through July 30, Thursdays through Sundays at 8 p.m. Admission free, no reservations, capacity 350. Other information: (914) 654-8533.</p>
