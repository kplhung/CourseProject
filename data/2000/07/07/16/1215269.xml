        <p>IT all began 15 years ago when Victoria Liberatori started a professional theater company in Princeton. She called it Princeton Rep, but there was no real home for it in Princeton.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Liberatori rented by the season, moving from one small space on the campus of Princeton University to another. She used a self-service laundry to put on a play in development by Marsha Norman. (It happened to be called ''The Laundromat.'') A storefront in town served as the stage for Fugard's ''Blood Knot.'' Then Princeton Rep went out of town, one season to Jersey City, another to New Brunswick. To Trenton, too.</p>

        <p>IT all began 15 years ago when Victoria Liberatori started a professional theater company in Princeton. She called it Princeton Rep, but there was no real home for it in Princeton.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Liberatori rented by the season, moving from one small space on the campus of Princeton University to another. She used a self-service laundry to put on a play in development by Marsha Norman. (It happened to be called ''The Laundromat.'') A storefront in town served as the stage for Fugard's ''Blood Knot.'' Then Princeton Rep went out of town, one season to Jersey City, another to New Brunswick. To Trenton, too.</p>
        <p>Ms. Liberatori's mission was to do new and contemporary plays. Once, Shaw somehow sneaked in, but Shakespeare? Never.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, after two years of ''restructuring and rethinking,'' in Ms. Liberatori's words, it also became clear that wandering was not working. By then Ms. Liberatori (as artistic director) had teamed up with Anne Reiss (as executive producer). Ms. Reiss studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, where Shakespeare is the thing. If we cannot find a home indoors, let's go outdoors, Ms. Reiss suggested.</p>
        <p>When one thinks of outdoor theater in the summer, can Shakespeare be far behind? And with Shakespeare in the summer, the word festival comes naturally.</p>
        <p>The two women thought of Palmer Square, an oasis of greenery in the center of Princeton. And that's how the Princeton Rep Shakespeare Festival came to be. For four years the company performed one play a summer in Palmer Square -- three performances on weekends -- drawing ever increasing crowds. Five hundred people could be seated; for some shows, 300 more stood.</p>
        <p>Ms. Liberatori and Ms. Reiss sensed they were onto something bigger than Shakespeare for three shows only on weekends. Then the rains came and the mayor of Princeton Borough followed, and the artistic director and the executive producer knew something bigger was really going to happen.</p>
        <p>Last summer when Mayor Marvin Reed and his wife, Ingrid, wanted to attend, rain forced a performance of ''Twelfth Night'' indoors -- at a local church.</p>
        <p>''When we got to the door of the Nassau Presbyterian Church, across the way from Palmer Square,'' Mr. Reed recalled, ''we were told, 'We have no room.' It was mobbed, so we walked to town, had a nice supper and didn't think too much about it.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Reiss was livid. ''I had to call and do a little damage control,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That call led to a meeting with the mayor, who was convinced that the company needed help. He called Phyllis Marchand, the mayor of Princeton Township. ''We have a joint recreation department,'' Mr. Reed said. ''And I knew of an amphitheater in a park, right by a pond, and we got together.''</p>
        <p>The park is Community Park North; and the amphitheater and the pond, not to mention the woods, the trees, the hill on which the stage sits, the paths and the patio nearby make up Pettoranello Gardens, named after a small town in Southern Italy.</p>
        <p>Now Princeton Rep's Shakespeare-on-the-Green or Shakespeare-on-the-Square, as it was variously known, can be called Shakespeare-in-the-Garden. In its first full season, two plays are being produced, each for four weekends, 24 performances in all, with the blessing of Actors' Equity. Admission is still free, though a $10 donation is suggested.</p>
        <p>In addition to such expected inteferences as the roar of an airplane, audiences can expect ''a resident flock of Canadian geese honking as dusk approaches,'' as well as ''an abundance of deer and small animals making guest appearances,'' in the words of Jeff Cohen, the director of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, who referred to the gardens as ''a nature preserve'' said, ''No set designer could come up with such a sublime setting for a perfect play.''</p>
        <p>''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' runs through July 23. ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' to be directed by Ms. Liberatori, is to follow, from Aug. 4 through 27.</p>
        <p>For all that, Ms. Reiss said Ms. Liberatori's commitment to untried works is undaunted. ''Now that we have a classical component,'' Ms. Reiss said, ''we still need to find the space for new plays.''</p>
