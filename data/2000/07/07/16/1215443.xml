        <p>Besides the obvious, one of the more notable psychic rewards for the hard work of successful investing is the opportunity for a celebratory toast to oneself when things turn out well. Mendocino County in California wants to make this pleasant ritual especially easy for some of its bondholders.</p>
        <p>To encourage owners of an issue sold in 1998 -- in connection with the county jail -- to sell the bonds back to the county or swap them for new longer-term notes paying higher interest, Mendocino is offering each owner six bottles of wine made by Fetzer, the county's largest producer. The set includes a 1998 Syrah, a 1997 Barrel Select Zinfandel, a 1997 Barrel Select Merlot, a 1998 Bonterra Viognier, a 1997 Bonterra Cabernet Sauvignon and a 1997 Special Reserve Chardonay.</p>
        <p>Fetzer is giving the county a special price on the set, which would sell for about $120 retail, and the company is also handling the shipping for the county.</p>
        <p>Who gets the largess? There are about 190 individual owners, accounting for about half of the 1998 bonds still outstanding, said Heather Calvano, an associate at Bondholder Communications, a firm that locates bondholders; the rest of the issue is held in trust by banks, which means some bank officers who have the authority to make investment decisions may be in line for some wine.</p>
        <p>Brokers for the individual owners will also get a gift box for each client they persuade to swap new bonds for old. But Mendocino County has set a ceiling of three gift sets per broker.</p>
