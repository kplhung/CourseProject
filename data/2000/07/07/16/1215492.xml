        <p>The Yankees called their temp agency -- Class AAA Columbus -- and asked for help, and Ryan Thompson is their left fielder today. Maybe it will not be his job in a week or even in a day, but Thompson is the Yankees' left fielder now, and he is intent on enjoying every bit of the experience, already knowing what it's like to be out of baseball.</p>
        <p>If he is good enough, the job could be his for the rest of the season, and in his first two games, Thompson has five runs batted in -- three coming on a home run in the Yankees' 6-2 victory over the Florida Marlins on Friday night.

        <p>The Yankees called their temp agency -- Class AAA Columbus -- and asked for help, and Ryan Thompson is their left fielder today. Maybe it will not be his job in a week or even in a day, but Thompson is the Yankees' left fielder now, and he is intent on enjoying every bit of the experience, already knowing what it's like to be out of baseball.</p>
        <p>If he is good enough, the job could be his for the rest of the season, and in his first two games, Thompson has five runs batted in -- three coming on a home run in the Yankees' 6-2 victory over the Florida Marlins on Friday night. Whether Thompson receives tenure from the Yankees ''obviously depends a lot on what he does,'' said Joe Torre, their manager.</p>
        <p>Evaluations in the Yankees' organization are made game to game, at-bat to at-bat; just ask Ricky Ledee or Ed Yarnall, two prospects traded in the last month after they flubbed auditions. Thompson pulled a hanging breaking ball down the third-base line for a run-scoring double in his first at-bat with the Yankees on Thursday and drew a bases-loaded walk. But Thompson also had a couple of strikeouts, looking awkward, flailing at a pitch shoulder high with runners on base. Torre referred to the strikeouts when asked about Thompson, as if the manager were keeping a running tally in his head of how the left fielder is faring.</p>
        <p>Thompson does not want to think about his chances. ''I'll let them worry about that,'' he said after Friday's game.</p>
        <p>What he was thinking about was getting the ball he drove into the stands Friday for his first home run in Yankee Stadium. ''That ball is getting put in a glass jar,'' Thompson said.</p>
        <p>He has other keepsakes from his baseball career. His father, Robert Thompson, keeps stacks of clippings from Ryan's time in the game, the stories from when he was a high school star in Maryland and his days as a Toronto Blue Jays prospect. There are probably articles from the days after the Mets insisted that Thompson be included in the two-prospect trade package for David Cone, in 1992. Jeff Kent was the other prospect; at the time, the Mets regarded him as the second-best player in the trade.</p>
        <p>Thompson reads the clippings of his days with the Mets now and reads about a cocky kid saying stuff that superstars say. Except that he never became the superstar that the Mets expected him to be, or that Thompson wanted to be. ''If you run your mouth,'' he said, ''you've got to put up the numbers.''</p>
        <p>Thompson never did, and by 1996, he was a journeyman, his stints in the big leagues short. He played briefly for Houston last season, slugging a home run on Sept. 7, and the Yankees signed him to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training. He turned 32.</p>
        <p>The Yankees kept him all the way through spring training and then cut him, and Thompson declined to return to the minors again. Technically, he was retired. Thompson went back to Maryland, watched his young daughter play soccer, relaxing, not thinking much about what he wanted to do.</p>
        <p>What Thompson learned was that he missed baseball, missed the little things that he had taken for granted. He missed running across an open field, over mowed grass, on a warm sunny day. He missed hitting, swinging his bat in practice until sweat dripped down his cheeks. He missed the game, the fun that had drawn him to baseball when he was a kid.</p>
        <p>The Yankees called at the end of April, checking to see how he liked being retired. Thompson went back to baseball. What he wanted to do, above all else, was make sure that he had fun, that he enjoyed his time in the game.</p>
        <p>Thompson slugged 20 homers in 247 at-bats for Columbus, including 11 homers after June 20, and batted .296. He was watching ESPN last Sunday night and saw a replay of Shane Spencer crumpling to the grass after his knee gave way. The next day, Thompson was told he was going to the major leagues to replace Spencer. Three days later, Thompson lounged in an empty Yankee Stadium after taking batting practice, the sun bright, the seats loud Yankee blue, in silence. Thompson sat there, looking around, looking back, looking forward.</p>
        <p>Ryan Dempster, the Florida pitcher, hung a slider in the fourth inning on Friday. Thompson swung and knew immediately he had hit a homer, and he bounced toward first base. Fans screamed, the noise reached him; Thompson felt like crying.</p>
        <p>In his Yankee Stadium office, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made and waited for phone calls, for information on possible trade targets for a new left fielder, someone other than Thompson.</p>
        <p>When Thompson jogged to his position for the fifth inning, fans stood and cheered for him. It is his job today, maybe a week, maybe longer.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DREW HENSON, the primary prospect in the package sent to Cincinnati for DENNY NEAGLE, has suggested he might play football professionally, rather than baseball. ''Go, football,'' said BRIAN CASHMAN, the Yankees' general manager, with projected enthusiasm. ''I'm a big University of Michigan fan.'' If Henson decides to play football, then the chance of Henson's turning into a baseball star -- and making the Yankees look bad -- is eliminated.</p>
