        <p>Dr. Gloria Frances Feiman Waldman and Norman William Schwartz are to be married today at their house in East Quogue, N.Y. Cantor Michael Trachtenberg is to perform the ceremony, with the Rev. Susan R. Turchin, an interfaith minister and a friend of the couple, taking part.</p>
        <p>The bride, 53, is a professor at York College of the City University of New York in Jamaica, Queens, where she teaches Spanish and women's, Puerto Rican and Latin American studies. She is also a theater professor at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waldman graduated from City College and received a master's degree in Romance languages from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in Spanish language and literature from CUNY. In 1966, she was a Fulbright scholar at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala City, where she studied Latin American culture. The bride is a daughter of the late Helen Pfeffer Feiman and the late Harry Feiman. Her previous marriage ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 63, is a salesman with Susan Elise, a maker of women's clothing in Manhattan. He is the son of the late Lillian Schwartz and the late Henry Schwartz. He has four children from his two previous marriages, which ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>The bride and the bridegroom met on a blind date last year arranged by Ms. Turchin, who had known both of them for years. Several years earlier, Mr. Schwartz had introduced Ms. Turchin to the man she eventually married, so Ms. Turchin said she felt obliged to return the favor. But she wasn't convinced she was making a great match. ''They never really came up in the same crowd,'' she said. ''Gloria is an academic and very political, Norman is a businessman and runs in those circles.''</p>
        <p>The bride was a little more blunt.</p>
        <p>''He's a capitalist -- what can I say? -- and I'm a Socialist,'' she said. ''So I guess our votes will cancel each other out.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Ms. Turchin talked both her friends into a lunch engagement. Upon meeting, they were so entranced with each other that they went from the restaurant to the theater and then to a dinner party. The next day, Valentine's Day, they went to the theater again. Soon they were inseparable.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waldman and Mr. Schwartz became engaged last September, on the same day that they made an offer on the house in Quogue, the first house that Dr. Waldman has owned. (She has lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Stuyvesant Town since she was 21.)</p>
        <p>Both the bride and the bridegroom say that their differences have made their relationship invigorating and filled with mutual surprises. ''We both need to be stimulated, we both need to be challenged,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''And I think that's one of the major attractions we have.''</p>
