        <p>For New Yorkers, Millbrook, a serene semirural Dutchess County community, is both a destination for leisurely wine excursions and the brand name of a line of wines.</p>
        <p>Since 1981, when Millbrook Vineyards and Winery produced its first commercial vintage, it has been the Hudson Valley's outstanding winery and one of the state's best.</p>
        <p>John W. Dyson and his wife, Kathe, own the 130-acre estate. Though he is well known as a vintner, politics has been his other life; for a time, he was Rudolph W. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development.</p>
        <p>As State Commerce Commissioner in Gov. Hugh L. Carey's administration, Mr. Dyson, a Democrat, created the ''I Love New York'' campaign.</p>
        <p>Today, he also produces wine in California and Tuscany. Millbrook's aromatic '98 Tocai Friulano, a sprightly light-bodied white based on an Italian grape and long a food-oriented feature of its portfolio, sells for about $13.</p>
        <p>The buttery-oaky, light-bodied simple '97 chardonnay, in a crisp Burgundian style version that offers not an iota of California-style fatness, is about $14.</p>
        <p>The opulent, jammy, smooth, almost-sweet, mouth-filling Proprietor's Special Reserve '98 cabernet franc is about $19.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, Millbrook wines, which can be special-ordered, have been carried by Sherry-Lehmann, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street); Morrell &amp; Company, 1 Rockefeller Plaza; and Columbus Circle Liquor, 1780 Broadway (57th Street).</p>
        <p>Open daily from noon to 5 P.M. for tastings and tours, the hillside winery, in a spacious whitewashed Dutch hip-roofed dairy barn, commands inspiring rural vistas. It is situated near the junction of the Shunpike and Wing Road in Millbrook; for information: (800) 662-9463; www.millbrookwine.com.</p>
