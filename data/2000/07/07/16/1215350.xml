        <p>IN the late 90's, residents of one block of West 118th Street in Harlem set out to renew their houses and their community in what was known as the Carmel Hill Project, and Bill Foley recorded their progress in photographs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foley won a Pulitzer Prize for photography in 1983 for recording the aftermath of a massacre in a Palestinian refugee camp. His Carmel Hill pictures some 60 black and white images that depict the area and its inhabitants before and after restoration -- will be on display at the Museum of the City of New York. The image at left, taken in 1998, is of children returning home from school in the neighborhood.</p>
