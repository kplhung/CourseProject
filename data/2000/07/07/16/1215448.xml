        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dr. David Bank has been my dermatologist for the past four years.  He has helped me recover from decubitus ulcers and prevent breakdowns that are related to long-term confinement in a wheelchair. Thanks to his expertise, he identified my rapidly advancing skin cancer and treated it successfully. Because of my limited mobility, he has always made house calls and charged the full professional fee for his services. He has never asked me for referrals to other celebrities or sought favors. Dr. Bank is a consummate professional whose reputation has been unfairly and grossly maligned.</p>
