        <p>Erroll McDonald  Editor Pantheon Books</p>
        <p>I immigrated to Brooklyn when I was 10 from a small, sleepy Caribbean port to a city that seemed excessive in every way -- too large, too bright, too crowded. Directly, one was confronted with the intractability of American racial strife in a way that I had been unaccustomed to in Costa Rica. I was preoccupied with reading billboards everywhere and advertisements on the subway, as the life they represented contrasted so sharply with life as I knew it in Brooklyn at the time. Few were my encounters with white people then. I was mostly unnerved by black Muslims who were a force in the neighborhood, grim black boys my age, dressed in dark suits and bow ties, remonstrating with me about indulging in basketball and other sport, the oppressive white man. I had no idea what they were talking about.</p>
        <p>Four years after coming to America, I was in culture shock again, having started 10th grade at the Bronx High School of Science. I had come from a predominantly black junior high school, where I had been valedictorian, to a predominantly white high school, where I felt insecure and at an instinctual disadvantage. For the first time, I met middle- and upper-middle-class black kids whom I could describe as privileged.</p>
        <p>In 1971, I went off to Yale, where I developed an interest in literature. After a B.A. in English and two years of graduate study in comparative literature, I decided Derridean deconstruction wasn't for me. I got an entry-level position at Random House and was won over to the world of publishing.</p>
        <p>Publishing is notoriously undiversified, the exception of course being mail-room and messenger staffs. This has changed neither for better or worse in my 23-year career.</p>
        <p>Every workday I leave my house (a multicultural haven, I like to joke: my wife is Polish, and we have two children) only to walk out into a varying weather of racial divisiveness, wherein the texture of one's hair, the color of one's skin, the features of one's face are assumed to be indexes of psychology, culture, politics and morality. The motive force of book publishing is the reading of books, and at the heart of reading is an open engagement with another, often across centuries and cultural moments. Yet the categorization of books in many stores belies this fact. Witness their black-interest sections. Curious though that every publisher is desperate for the nod from a black woman in the form of an Oprah's Book Club selection! This obstinate apartheid remains bizarre to me, if only because it reinforces divisiveness and ignorance. Perhaps the most poignant meeting that I have ever had was this: at the time the book proposal for ''The Bell Curve'' was making the rounds, the agent, bless her wit, sent the co-author, Charles Murray, to meet prospective editors, myself included. The proposal, needless to say, captured my interest. I wanted to know more about the book's argument. When Mr. Murray arrived at my office, he seemed visibly taken aback, not having anticipated that he would be offering an exegesis of his profundities to someone with my texture of hair, color of skin and facial features. The man was gracious, if understandably a bit guarded. We both partook in as civil a conversation as we could withstand, and said our goodbyes.</p>
