        <p>For nearly 25 years, the Westbeth Theater Center has been an incubator for new talents and unconventional productions. But its final curtain call may be drawing near.  Its landlord has threatened to replace the company with commercial tenants who can pay more rent.</p>
        <p>The theater, at 151 Bank Street, is part of a complex that includes an art gallery, art studios and subsidized artists' housing, all operated by the nonprofit Westbeth Corporation. The theater pays about $2.70 per square foot and has had a 23-year lease, which expires this October, with a monthly extension permitted through May. An appraiser hired by the corporation estimates that the space has a market value as high as $25 per square foot.</p>
        <p>''They had a sweetheart deal,'' said Carl Stein, president of the corporation's board. He said that when the corporation was founded, one of the premises was that the commercial space would help pay for the artists' housing.</p>
        <p>But Arnold Engelman, the theater's producing director, said the corporation was turning its back on the arts.</p>
        <p>''The idea of getting the market value for this space is against what an arts organization is about,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engelman also disputed the appraiser's estimate, saying that its report did not note that the theater needed repairs like a new power grid, heating system and soundproofing.</p>
        <p>The theater has had a long string of acclaimed performances by emerging and untraditional artists, including John Cameron Mitchell in ''Hedwig and the Angry Inch,'' a glam-rock musical that is being made into a movie.</p>
        <p>''They are a unique showcase,'' said Roy Gabay, a theater producer whose recent plays include ''The Laramie Project'' and ''Wit.'' ''Their space crosses the line between cabaret and proscenium theater. It would be sad to think that would not be available.''</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers have recently toured the 90-000-square-foot space, which includes offices, dressing rooms and a rehearsal studio. Several companies, including a video production studio, have expressed interest. While management officials said they would prefer to keep it an arts space, they have not ruled out other possibilities.</p>
        <p>The theater has secured its own appraiser and plans to offer a counterproposal this month.</p>
        <p>''What we do here can't be measured by dollars and cents,'' Mr. Engelman said.</p>
