        <p>A RESTAURANT like Wildfire in Greenwich makes a reviewer's day. We are always happier when we can praise a restaurant rather than slam it. Fortunately, when it comes to Wildfire and its short compelling menu, there is much to praise, almost nothing to slam, and only a few minor quibbles.</p>
        <p>If there is anything that speaks of summer more refreshingly than a chilled fresh pea soup, we can't think of it. The presentation was lovely, with a few fresh peas and tiny croutons in the center, surrounded by the greenest of peppery green pea puree. A swirl of rosemary-infused cream provided an extra taste sensation.</p>

        <p>A RESTAURANT like Wildfire in Greenwich makes a reviewer's day. We are always happier when we can praise a restaurant rather than slam it. Fortunately, when it comes to Wildfire and its short compelling menu, there is much to praise, almost nothing to slam, and only a few minor quibbles.</p>
        <p>If there is anything that speaks of summer more refreshingly than a chilled fresh pea soup, we can't think of it. The presentation was lovely, with a few fresh peas and tiny croutons in the center, surrounded by the greenest of peppery green pea puree. A swirl of rosemary-infused cream provided an extra taste sensation.</p>
        <p>Two other starters hit the mark almost as well. Country salad, a prettily arranged mix of celery root (the menu said endive but this worked even better), sliced beets and Roquefort chunks, offered clear, distinctive flavors and textures, bracing as a sea breeze. Slightly more substantial was grilled quail, cooked to tender perfection, a mahogany-colored island in a sea of French lentils and frisee.</p>
        <p>Entrees, at both lunch and dinner, were well-designed for summer appetites. We were most pleased with the honey-glazed duck, which harmonized beautifully with Swiss chard and peach chutney. There was not an off-key note in the entire dish. Grilled tuna nicoise, rare as ordered, came with ribbons of fennel, red peppers, olives and capers -- a quintet that also sang melodiously.</p>
        <p>We have rarely tasted gnocchi as tender as the golden nubbins served at lunch. Combined with sauteed slices of porcini and garlic in truffle oil, the result was ambrosial.</p>
        <p>Two other lunch choices were almost as memorable. The natural succulence of sea scallops (three monster-large, richly-browned ones) was enhanced by a subtly seasoned, curry-accented sauce with mizuna (an Asian green). Cod and crab cake, also browned to perfection, was a well-balanced combination, with the crab holding its own against the more assertive cod. The cake rested on a cool, crisp celery root-apple slaw.</p>
        <p>Wildfire had a few misses, easily correctable: Zucchini flowers stuffed with crab meat, for example, was a neat idea, but the crab was minimal and the batter too thick for the dainty blossoms. Lobster salad, another starter, was lightly cooked, but underseasoned and bland. Three soft-shell crabs had a salsa of chopped tomato and toasted almonds that was too vinegary and made the crabs soggy. Grilled loin of lamb had fine flavor, but the dish was a mishmash of jaggedly cut lamb, artichoke hearts, green beans embedded in mashed potatoes and zucchini, all sloshed together. The stylishness evident in most of Wildfire's presentations was missing.</p>
        <p>Desserts are Wildfire's apogee, epitomized by a warm, tangy apricot tarte tatin, with an exquisite puff pastry crust. Lemon raspberry Napoleon, with crispy, leaf-thin layers, puckery tart lemon filling and fresh berries on a plate embroidered with raspberry coulis was another triumph.</p>
        <p>Less showy, but just as superb was panna cotta, a delicate milky pudding that is a Piedmontese specialty. A workman-like creme brulee wore a crisp, tissue paper-thin brown sugar seal. We liked the flavor of the warm chocolate souffle cake, though it was a tad dry. Mission figs, a pleasing dessert idea, was tasty, even though the menu-listed oat crisp was missing.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses apiece, came to $76, before tax, tip or drinks. Wildfire's wine list is sizeable and exceptionally well-chosen, strong on wines from the West Coast, France, Italy and Australia. Prices begin at $25 but quickly tilt upward.</p>
        <p>It is a pleasure to find a restaurant that seems to know and achieve almost exactly what it wants to do. There is very little that is haphazard, what with the minimalist good looks of the decor, the taut, unusual menu, the sensible rather than grossly large servings, and the well-trained staff.</p>
