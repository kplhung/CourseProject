        <p>The stalled effort to build the International Space Station lurched ahead with the launching of the Russian Zvezda service module. The 20-ton craft, which is to serve as the orbital outpost's crucial command and living section during early stages of construction, began a series of maneuvers and tests aimed at having it dock with the nascent station on July 25.</p>
        <p>With Zvezda in place, the United States and 15 partner nations can end an 18-month building hiatus primarily caused by Russia's not having the money to finish and fly their segment. Saying they had traveled a very long road to get Zvezda launched, Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, thanked project partners for their patience and support. ''We wish this road had been a highway, but a highway it was not,'' he said. ''It was oftentimes closed for repairs. We have experienced detours, bumps and holes.''</p>
