        <p>Dozens of readers responded to Peter Applebome's July 2 column. Here is a sampling of their reactions.</p>
        <p>I find that you needlessly complicate your ''dilemma'' and in so doing reveal much of what is wrong with race relations in this country. Why should it be a complication that the owner of the vehicle with the blazing music is black, especially ''a large black man with his shirt mostly unbuttoned.'' Immediately you conjure up racist images loaded with preconceived -- dare I say prejudiced? -- ideas of this individual. If you find the person threatening to you and your child, you should be honest with the child and explain to your daughter your  feelings and your conflict, should you recognize it as such. Otherwise, your daughter will (because you know how perceptive children are) pick up on the tension and in so doing probably perpetuate the fear and image you obviously carry with you. By talking it through you at least get the opportunity to bask in the sunlight of truth rather than hide your feelings in the shadow of lies. It is your duty as a parent.</p>

        <p>Your gas station encounter might have been a test from God to see how you might react to another human being. Instead of grasping the chance to explain the world (sorry, it is complicated even for 9-year-old white girls living in Westchester) and your views on it, you chose to brush it away. The fellow had every right to listen to whatever music he wanted to. You have the right to criticize it and explain your feelings to your daughter. She's going to hear that music somewhere at sometime again. You can't hide her away from the world forever.</p>
