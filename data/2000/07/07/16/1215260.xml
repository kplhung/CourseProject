        <p>WITH a gentle whoosh, the 11:05 a.m. pulled out of Exchange Place here and began its 7.5-mile run through a landscape of crisp new office towers, overgrown scrap yards and century-old row houses. The two-car tram to Bayonne was empty, save for a wistful-looking man gazing out of the oversized windows.</p>
        <p>It was Stephen Sosinski's first ride on the three-month-old Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, and the journey was carrying the 48-year-old horse trainer back to his childhood, when he and his mother would ride the clattering Jersey Central to the ferries bound for New York.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Sosinski left home 25 years ago, the Jersey Central had gone under, as had most of the factories, shipyards and refineries that sustained Hudson County's waterfront. All the years he lived in Florida, Mr. Sosinski rarely admitted he was from this dying corner of New Jersey. ''It was a sinking ship, a depressing place,'' he said. ''I vowed never to return. And I never did.''</p>
        <p>But this 23-minute trolley ride, he said, was shaking up his senses -- dizzying construction at every turn, the reawakened riverfront, and most of all, the electrified trains that have helped reconnect his former hometown to New York and the rest of the world. ''Believe it or not, I'd consider moving back,'' he said as the sleek black and white cars eased into 34th Street, a few blocks from where his sister still lives. ''Suddenly, this place feels like the center of the universe again.''</p>
        <p>Boosters of the Hudson-Bergen line would be heartened by Mr. Sosinski's sentiments, especially since ridership, a third below projections, has been so disappointing. While the $1.1 billion system has been championed as a salve for congestion and air pollution and a spark for urban renewal, light rail is having other salubrious, if somewhat intangible, effects on the people and places it serves.</p>
        <p>For Jersey City and Bayonne, these modern-day streetcars reaffirm a long-awaited rebirth. Egalitarian and exhaust-free, the trains are a curious sight on local streets, and they inspire nostalgia and civic pride in a way that buses do not.</p>
        <p>While such abstractions are never included in transportation planning studies, America's romance with trolleys is helping spur a veritable boom in light rail around the state, making New Jersey the second most active place for new construction after California.</p>
        <p>Less expensive than commuter trains and far easier to build, light rail runs on low-voltage electric lines and can move along local streets with minimal disruption. Manufactured in Japan and assembled in Harrison, the system's 29 cars can climb hills with ease, quickly reach 55 miles an hour and brake faster than buses. And unlike heavy rail, the trains are entered at street level, making them easily accessible to the disabled and the elderly.</p>
        <p>Yet as the love affair with light rail  blooms, there is an insistent group of transit experts who see these modern-day trolleys as wasteful and misguided attempts to grapple with overcrowded roads and tainted air. Most light rail systems, they say, have failed to make a noticeable dent in congestion, and ridership has consistently fallen short of projections.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, in addition to the Hudson-Bergen route, which is expected to reach Ridgefield by 2010, New Jersey Transit broke ground last month on a 34-mile system connecting Trenton to Camden. Work on another line, linking Elizabeth and Newark, is expected to get under way in the next few years. The Newark City Subway, essentially a trolley that runs partly underground, will soon receive the same cars that run on the Hudson-Bergen line, and transportation officials hope to extend those tracks to the Meadowlands and Paterson before the end of the decade. From Cape May to northern Bergen County, there is talk of another half-dozen projects.</p>
        <p>''The future of New Jersey is filled with light rail,'' said Jeff Warsh, executive director of New Jersey Transit. ''It's not bravado, it's not spin. It's the plan.''</p>
        <p>That future partly depends on federal largesse, which has been responsible for up to 80 percent of all light rail construction costs nationwide. But as dozens of cities jump on the light rail bandwagon, the pool of money is shrinking. When the Hudson-Bergen line broke ground in 1996, there were 20 projects angling for $5.8 billion in federal dollars. This year there are nearly 200 vying for $6.3 billion. ''The competition,'' Mr. Warsh said, ''has become severe.''</p>
        <p>BUT Gary Brosch, editor of The Journal of Public Transportation, said there is a growing debate among planners about whether light rail is a cost-effective alternative to buses, which are cheaper and more flexible than fixed rail lines. Both sides, he said, have been known to engage in hyperbole.</p>
        <p>''The advocates feel so passionately about its needs that they overstate the benefits,'' Mr. Brosch said. ''The result is that once a system is built, there is bound to be disappointment.''</p>
        <p>In selling its first light rail project, New Jersey Transit predicted 14,400 daily riders on the first leg of the line, which includes 12 stations between Bayonne and Jersey City. As of last week, that number was 4,633.</p>
        <p>Still, light rail enthusiasts have been heartened by a healthy rise from the system's first weeks, when an average of 2,781 passengers rode the trains each day. ''It's creeping up slowly and steadily,'' said Douglas J. Bowen, president of the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers, an advocacy group. ''People don't change their travel patterns overnight.''</p>
        <p>And some people do, among them 22-year-old Ian MacDonald, who was taking the train to Jersey City's West Side Avenue station one recent afternoon. Until the line was inaugurated in April, Mr. MacDonald rode a bus to his job at the Hudson Mall, leaving him with a 20-minute walk. With light rail, he is five minutes from work. Mr. MacDonald said everyone he knows is excited about the train, which includes a spur through his battered neighborhood here. ''It's quiet, quick and it gets me there on time,'' he said as he stepped on to the platform.</p>
        <p>Cynics of light rail may hold up Mr. MacDonald as an example of why its benefits are illusory. Light rail, they say, siphons riders from bus lines, creating the semblance of demand. ''Rail tends to be sexier than buses, so as long as the trains are shiny and clean, people call it a success,'' said Wendell Cox, an Illinois-based transportation consultant. ''They just doesn't serve modern America's transportation needs.''</p>
        <p>Because light rail travels on a fixed route, it will only appeal to a tiny segment of travelers, Mr. Cox said, and die-hard drivers will never trade in their cars for the train. ''Light rail has no transportation function at all,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Brett Caracciolo was proving the naysayers wrong. A systems analyst from Millstone, Mr. Caracciolo, 37, was on his way to a meeting in Jersey City, having driven to a Park-and-Ride lot at the Liberty Science Center. In the past he would have driven to Exchange Place, but downtown traffic and $22 parking lured him from his car. Including parking, the round trip costs $5.</p>
        <p>''This is fantastic,'' Mr. Caracciolo said, taking in the pristine upholstery and that new-car smell. ''There's no way I would drive now.''</p>
        <p>So far, most of New Jersey Transit's 2,400 Park-and-Ride spaces remain empty most weekdays. But transit officials say they expect the number of users to rise in the coming months as workers install pedestrian bridges linking platforms to parking lots.</p>
        <p>For his part, Martin Robins, a transportation expert at Rutgers, said it was premature to judge the Hudson-Bergen line. Mr. Robins pointed out that two-thirds of the route remained unfinished, including the leg to Hoboken terminal, used by more than 40,000 commuters a day. That segment, and another to the Newport Mall, will be completed in 2002. And with a score of office and apartment buildings in Jersey City quickly rising, the number of potential riders customers is expected to mount.</p>
        <p>''You have to remember, some very important ingredients are missing,'' he said. ''This is just the beginning.''</p>
        <p>More than 75 percent of light rail riders are from Bayonne, something that has surprised many officials. In response, New Jersey Transit added a handful of express trains from Bayonne to Exchange Place, cutting the 23-minute journey to 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>When the light rail system was proposed two decades ago, some experts argued against extending the line to Bayonne. ''They said, 'No one from Bayonne commutes to New York,' '' recalled Mr. Bowen of the New Jersey Railroad Passengers Association. ''I said, 'Well maybe one day they will.' ''</p>
        <p>When the line is extended to the foot of the Bayonne Bridge, officials said it will provide commuters from Staten Island a quicker way to reach Manhattan.</p>
        <p>After years of job losses, Bayonne is giddy about light rail, saying it is the best thing to happen to this working-class city in decades. The mayor, Joseph Doria, credits the train with lifting real-estate values by 25 percent. Residents gripe about parking lost to commuters, but they are also thrilled by the notion, heard up and down Broadway, that Bayonne is the next Hoboken.</p>
        <p>''It's going to give Bayonne a big boost,'' said Lynn Edelman, who owns a dress shop  a block from the station. ''We're so close to Manhattan now. It makes perfect sense.''</p>
        <p>Ann Smith, a payroll company executive, says the easy commute to her Manhattan office is the reason she recently bought a house in Bayonne. ''The buses are old, cruddy and they stop at every other block,'' Ms. Smith said. ''If there was no train, I don't think I would have bought.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said that almost every week, someone knocked on her door to ask if she might sell her house, across from the 34th Street station. ''I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of gold,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In a pioneering private-public arrangement aimed at controlling costs and speeding up construction, New Jersey Transit hired Twenty-First Century Rail, a consortium of companies to design, build and operate the system's first segment.</p>
        <p>Like most public transportation systems in America, the Hudson-Bergen light rail does not pay for itself, although officially, it is supposed to break even by 2010, when 100,000 daily riders are expected. One-way tickets cost $1.50 and are sold from machines on station platforms. Because there are no people working in ticket booths, some older passengers have complained, saying the vending machines make travel a bit daunting. In addition, fare collection is honor-based, although ticket agents occasionally hand out $71 fines to scofflaws.</p>
        <p>Most people encountered during a full day of riding the rail were enthusiastic about the trains, although there was some grumbling: platform signs were insufficient; fares were too high; the trains move too slowly around Jersey City's curves. ''At some spots, I could walk faster than the train,'' said Atef Mikhael, 28, a medical resident. ''And why do they have to stop at every traffic light?''</p>
        <p>Many light rail experts agree with the criticism, saying that an efficient system should turn red lights to green, something known as signal pre-emption. Vic Simmons, a light rail consultant from England who was making a study tour of the Hudson-Bergen line recently, agreed.</p>
        <p>''They should be given the right of way,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''It doesn't make sense that 100 people are being held for two cars.''</p>
        <p>Dan Censullo, a light rail specialist for New Jersey Transit, said the system was not designed to change traffic lights immediately; however, it does speed up signals to favor trains. As the system matures, Mr. Censullo said, travel time may be reduced by adding more trains and cutting back how long they wait on the platforms. In the end, however, the system is limited by traffic rules, which in Jersey City prevent street-level trains from moving faster than 25 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>While the trains nearly fill with commuters during rush hours, they are often sparsely used at other times. But compared with the first few weeks, when some trains ran empty, use is clearly on the rise. One recent afternoon, Krystle Bransky, 16, and Vinnie Fonti, 15, were taking the train to Liberty State Park from Bayonne ''just for the heck of it,'' Krystle said. There were plenty of other joy riders, including 3-year-old Nicholas Stallone, who was taking his first ride. ''Every day we go out, he makes me drive by the train,'' said his mother, Sharon. ''If we don't see the train, he cries.''</p>
        <p>THEN there was the couple from Bayonne on their way to meet friends at a Jersey City bar. ''We could have driven,'' said the man. ''But then we wouldn't have been able to drink as much.''</p>
        <p>Tourists have also been venturing on the train. Gerry McNamara, 61, a teacher from Dublin who was headed to Liberty Science Center, was mesmerized by the haze-shrouded silhouette of lower Manhattan. ''I prefer this to driving,'' Mr. McNamara said. ''I would not have been happy in a car, not with the way my sister drives.''</p>
        <p>Although it remains to be seen whether more commuters will give up their cars, many of them will eventually be forced to do so by the reality of the new Hudson River waterfront. The parking lots that once accommodated their cars are giving way to new construction, and the density of development is making driving increasingly untenable. Mayor Bret Schundler said that without light rail here, congestion would have choked off new investment. ''Our roads can only take so much,'' Mr. Schundler said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, he and other officials hope the line will carry some of that prosperity to other parts of the city. This year, a shopping center opened alongside the Martin Luther King Drive Station, the first for a neighborhood that has seen little redevelopment in decades. Mr. Schundler said he envisions suburbanites, swayed by an easy commute, moving to homes adjacent to the line.</p>
        <p>There is a sad irony in light rail's return, more than 40 years after the last streetcar line was torn up in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>''Trolleys were once so ubiquitous in American cities, you couldn't go a few blocks without hitting one,'' said Stephen Goddard, who wrote ''Getting There: The Epic Struggle Roads and Rail in American Century'' (Basic Books, 1994).</p>
        <p>Killed by the ascendant automobile, the very success of the private car is fueling the trolley's return, often on the very same abandoned track beds. Most of the Hudson-Bergen line, for example, occupies the right-of-way used by defunct rail companies.</p>
        <p>''People talk about light rail as if it's a futuristic thing,'' said Mr. Warsh of New Jersey Transit. ''It's really a return to the past. We're putting back what was once there.''</p>
