        <p>David J Edmondson letter responds to Robert B Reich's July 11 Op-ed article that criticized education system and standardized testing; condemns 'one size fits all' educational scheme (M)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Robert B. Reich is right in pointing out that our schools do students a disservice by trying to give them all the same education (Op-Ed, July 11). In the 1970's, educators tried a ''one size fits all'' educational scheme.</p>
        <p>At the time, educators branded as elitist any educational system that allowed the brightest students to get ahead and reasoned that if not everyone could benefit from advanced classes, it was unfair to offer them to anyone. Schools canceled advanced classes and placed students of all ability levels into the same classes, which proceeded at a glacial pace for the bright students.</p>

        <p>Apparently, that sort of ideology took precedence over letting students learn anything.</p>
