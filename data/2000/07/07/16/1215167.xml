        <p>In many Paris train and metro stations these days, the loudspeakers play warnings in both French and English that pickpockets are about. Pay attention to your belongings, the recording says.</p>
        <p>Paris remains a great city to stroll and explore, a place that is alive and quite safe into the wee hours. But crime has been creeping up here for several years, and the crime directed against tourists is the kind that can ruin a vacation: stolen wallets, stolen baggage, credit card fraud.</p>
        <p>Police officials say that added to these old regulars is the newest crime on the upswing: the theft of cellular phones, which are often whisked off cafe tables or even snatched while people hold them up to their ears.</p>
        <p>''These are very rapid, very furtive thefts,'' said Frederic Dupuch, who is in charge of the police department's crime prevention service. ''The only thing we recommend is to keep the phones tucked away when you aren't using them. And be aware of your surroundings when you are.''</p>
        <p>Visitors, Mr. Dupuch says, are prey in all the tourist areas, from the steep steps of Montmartre to the lines at the Eiffel Tower and the platforms in the Gare du Nord, though these are not the city's worst crime areas. Nor is there much violence. Last year, just 0.75 percent of the crimes reported in Paris involved tourists; of those, less than 1 percent included any sort of assault.</p>
        <p>Most of Paris's crime problems are attributed to years of high unemployment and growing restlessness among poor youth who have grown up in the outskirts of the city.</p>
        <p>Unlike American cities, where the rich tend to flee to the suburbs, French cities have built their public housing outside of the downtown areas, relegating the poor and the immigrants to sometimes dreary and dangerous projects far from jobs. Not surprisingly, the Paris neighborhoods hit hardest by crime are those on the outskirts of the city.</p>
        <p>Visitors should also be aware that their rental-car license plates often signal that they are tourists. Many of France's rental cars are registered in the Marne region for cost reasons and therefore have license-plate numbers ending with 51. Those who rent such cars should avoid leaving their belongings in a car whenever possible.</p>
