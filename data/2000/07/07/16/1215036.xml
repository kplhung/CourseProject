        <p>TROUBLING CONFESSIONS</p>
        <p>Speaking Guilt in Law and Literature.</p>
        <p>By Peter Brooks.</p>
        <p>207 pp. Chicago:</p>
        <p>The University of Chicago Press. $24.</p>
        <p>Confession is good for the soul, but the soul is not always so good for confession, at least in the strictly legal sense of the word. That, in essence, is the theme of ''Troubling Confessions,'' a book so rich in fresh ideas that I found myself underlining as madly as an undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Although Peter Brooks began his study of confession before the Supreme Court's recent review of the Miranda decision, it provides an ideal context for understanding Miranda's history and implications. With graceful erudition he traces the development of the concept of the self over the centuries and the role that the act of confession has played in its formation. ''Without a sense of the self and its narrative, there could be no confession; and without the requirement of confession, internally or externally mandated, there would be no exploration of this selfhood.'' Confession presupposes inner depths, hidden secrets, no matter who is trying to get at them -- inquisitor, confessor, psychiatrist, talk-show host or cop. The suspect is in a most paradoxical position: ''On the one hand, the court's insistence that the subject's will remain free, uncoerced; on the other hand, all the efforts of police interrogators to break the will.''</p>
        <p>Given that dynamic, plus the belief that silence is a tacit admission of guilt, the suspect no longer fits the 18th-century image of clear mind and free will that is a fundamental tenet of the law. People confess under the duress of third degree or, more likely, make a plea bargain that involves confessing to a lesser charge whether they are guilty of it or not. According to Brooks, however, the real problem is not only that the psyche is primed to confess but that sometimes people admit to crimes they did not commit, to assuage other sufferings of the soul. Turbulent, self-lacerating, driven by passion rather than reason, the soul is, in a word, Dostoyevskian. Naturally, Brooks quotes Dmitri Karamazov's confessions from ''The Brothers Karamazov'': ''I accept the torment of accusation and of my disgrace before all, I want to suffer and be purified by suffering! But hear me. . . . I am not guilty of my father's blood! I accept punishment not because I killed him, but because I wanted to kill him, and might well have killed him.'' He also cites actual cases where people confessed in similar fashion, if not as eloquently as Dmitri.</p>
        <p>It is Brooks's contention that the modern sense of self has its roots in the Roman Catholic Church's Fourth Lateran Council. Convoked in 1215, the Council made annual confession obligatory while at the same time establishing for the first time an official church dogma and an Inquisition to root out heresy. Without in the least intending to, the church created the earliest model of the modern self with its id and unconscious (the secrets created by passion and hidden in shame), the ego of the confessant who is free to choose between self-revelation or concealment, and the superego, whether forgiving father confessor or the fire and steel of the Inquisition. By the magic of cultural development, this model flowered into Rousseau's Confessions, an attempt to catch the self in the mirror of mind, and ultimately into tell-all talk shows whose anthropological strangeness is obscured by their vulgarity.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the very nature of its subject, this is a book of questing and questioning. Brooks does not advocate any clear-cut position on how the law should coordinate its theory of the individual with what we have learned about ourselves from history, literature and psychology. But the very posing of the questions is more radical and subversive than any specific position could be. ''I am not able to provide an exit from the impasses of thinking I have evoked here,'' Brooks says, having realized that to ''ask the law to recognize the Dostoyeskian nature of the situation might be to disable it entirely.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps there is a partial solution to the problem in the words of the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides concerning the banning of confessions of guilt in criminal cases, quoted both by Brooks and in the original Miranda decision: ''It is a scriptural decree that the court shall not put a man to death or flog him on his own admission. . . . Perhaps he was one of those who are in misery, bitter in soul, who long for death. . . . Perhaps this was the reason that prompted him to confess to a crime he had not committed, in order that he be put to death.''</p>
        <p>Simply prohibiting confessions, long considered the ''queen of proofs,'' might not disable the law but compel it to prove its case on purely objective grounds, a task that has been made easier by scientific advances like DNA testing. But Brooks also envisions a more disquieting scenario, a natural successor to Court TV -- Interrogation TV: ''We might not be able to keep from watching; we might be deeply disturbed by what we saw.''</p>
        <p>Confession, of course, is only the most dramatic of the stories we tell about ourselves, and Brooks's book is also a fascinating inquiry into the nature of these tales. Through careful readings of Dante, Camus and Rousseau, he illuminates both the human condition and the deep affinities between the law and literature. An interrogation manual reveals that the ''qualities of the effective interrogator . . . in fact sound rather like those of the novelist.'' Stories compete to be the ''controlling narrative.'' It is the interrogator's account that the suspect must sign; the psychiatrist's version, stated or elicited, that the analysand must confront. Considering ''victim impact statements,'' a new sentimental favorite in the courts, he again poses unsettling questions: ''What is the right story, what is its correct place, and how should it be listened to?''</p>
        <p>We shape ourselves through stories and stories are made of language. The language of the law strains to be universal and precise. It is magnificent when it succeeds -- Stendhal studied the Napoleonic Code as a model of lucid prose -- and opaque when it fails. Brooks's prose occasionally achieves some flair, as when he describes interrogation rooms as ''Spartan and squalid.'' He writes of questions so complex and self-referential that they threaten to recede into an ''infinite regress,'' but he does so with a clarity that could have only come from rigorous struggle. At times he lapses into turgid academic jargon, in which case it is the reader who must struggle. Fortunately, such patches are few and, in any case, why shouldn't a reader struggle a bit when the reward is new ideas that are at once disturbing and exhilarating?</p>
