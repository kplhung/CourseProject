        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You were an indispensable advocate for the adoption of New York's landmarks law 35 years ago. It is most encouraging to see editorial support return for one of the key tenets of that law, the need to preserve buildings and places not only for their architecture, but also for their history and their role in history.</p>
        <p>People from all walks of life are fascinated by places like Gettysburg, where great events took place, but also, as recognized in your editorial (''Lincoln Read Here,'' July 12), by places that were only a background, like the cottage where President Lincoln wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. His summer place is the architectural equivalent of old letters and diaries, things that vividly bring back the life of 140 years ago.</p>
        <p>Saving such places is the indispensable complement to preserving great architectural monuments, as our local landmarks law wisely determined in 1965: we need to prevent ''the irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of the aesthetic, cultural and historic values represented'' by our local landmarks.</p>
        <p>RONALD J. KOPNICKI  President, Society  for the Architecture of the City  New York, July 12, 2000</p>
