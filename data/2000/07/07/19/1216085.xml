        <p>Court Ruling Could Raise Costs for Phone Companies  In a legal victory for local telephone companies, a federal appeals court struck down pricing rules that federal regulators had hoped would foster competition in local communications markets.</p>
        <p>If the ruling stands, it could lead to an increase in the fees that companies pay for connecting to the networks of local carriers, adding millions of dollars in costs for long-distance giants like AT&amp;T and WorldCom as well as for new companies that are trying to break into the local telephone business.

        <p>Court Ruling Could Raise Costs for Phone Companies  In a legal victory for local telephone companies, a federal appeals court struck down pricing rules that federal regulators had hoped would foster competition in local communications markets.</p>
        <p>If the ruling stands, it could lead to an increase in the fees that companies pay for connecting to the networks of local carriers, adding millions of dollars in costs for long-distance giants like AT&amp;T and WorldCom as well as for new companies that are trying to break into the local telephone business. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>Intel Reports Strong Sales Growth  Intel posted record second-quarter earnings, largely because of gains on investments. But the company also reported revenue growth that was stronger than expected, and it narrowly beat expectations for earnings from its products and services. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Apple Computer delivered mixed quarterly returns, with earnings exceeding expectations but sales falling short of projections. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch to Cut 1,800 Jobs  Grappling with slowing growth in its brokerage business, Merrill Lynch officials said the firm would eliminate about 1,800 jobs, mostly in New Jersey. An internal announcement of the cuts, most of which are expected in the next few weeks, came after Merrill said that its second-quarter earnings rose 34 percent despite a slim increase in revenue from commissions and slower growth in the amount of money customers invested at the firm. Shares of Merrill fell $3.75, to $128.25. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Taco Bell Dismisses Ad Agency  Taco Bell is parting ways with TBWA/Chiat/Day, which created the company's popular talking Chihuahua character, and will consolidate its account for the time being at FCB Worldwide. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Shopkorn to Join Druckenmiller  Stanley Shopkorn, former chief equity trader at Salomon Brothers and most recently top equity strategist at Moore Capital's hedge funds, will join Duquesne Capital, where he will work with Stanley Druckenmiller, former managing director of Soros Fund Management. [C25.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Declines in Profit Taking  The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply as investors chose to take profits, sliding 97.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 64.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,739.92, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.75 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,493.74. [C14.]</p>
        <p>G.M. Profit Beats Expectations  General Motors revamped its sales discounts for the third quarter and said that its profits inched up in the second quarter instead of falling slightly, as had been expected. [C2.]</p>
        <p>He Feels the Need for Speed  Fred Mouawad, chief executive of Mondera.com, an Internet company for luxury goods, has an ''extreme sensitivity to time.'' As in speed. As in Ferrari and Porsche. And as in business, from his family's jewelry operations to his venture capital firm and then back to gems -- ''this time over the Web'' -- to a pizza chain in India and a coffee chain in Thailand. Mondera is in New York, the world's fastest city. And the Internet, he says, ''is a never-ending race against time.'' The Boss. [C11.]</p>
        <p>Air-Traffic System Near Gridlock  The air-traffic system approached gridlock over the weekend, with delays of up to eight hours. And the crisis could grow in the heaviest travel months of July and August. Joe Sharkey: Business Travel. [C10.]</p>
