        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>CANDIDATE RESTORED TO BALLOT  Jack E. Robinson III, the Republican Senate candidate who had been bounced from the Massachusetts ballot in his challenge to Edward M. Kennedy, has suddenly stopped looking quite so beleaguered. The state's highest court ruled yesterday that Mr. Robinson could appear on the November ballot because he did in fact have the 10,000 signatures he needed to qualify. The court said a few dozen signature forms that were printed upside-down should still be counted. Mr. Robinson said that the decision would let him finally get his campaign into full gear. He plans to push ahead with fund-raising and organization-building, and to seek a reconciliation with state Republican leaders who had disavowed him earlier in the campaign as he was parrying accusations about his past. His chances against the most prominent member of one of America's best known political families in an overwhelmingly Democratic state are still seen as slim.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>GORE TRAILS BUSH IN ARKANSAS  Bill Clinton and Al Gore carried Mr. Clinton's home state of Arkansas by comfortable margins in 1992 and 1996. But a new Mason-Dixon poll conducted for The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette raises some doubts whether Mr. Gore can continue the streak. It has Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ahead 46 percent to 40 percent, with 11 percent undecided. ''A very disconcerting poll for Democrats,'' crowed Mr. Bush's Arkansas chairman, Senator Tim Hutchinson. Mr. Gore's chairman, state Attorney General Mark Pryor, countered: ''It's encouraging for Gore because most of the undecided voters will back him.'' The poll, conducted July 13 through 15, covered 622 likely voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>CAROLINE KENNEDY TO SPEAK  Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, perhaps the most private of all the Kennedys, has agreed to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month, 40 years after the party nominated her father there. Her late brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., addressed the Democratic convention in 1988, and her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who will appear with her, is a regular fixture at the conventions.</p>

        <p>THE GREENS</p>
        <p>A VOW TO REPLACE GREENSPAN  Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee, said that if he is elected president he would not reappoint Alan Greenspan to a fifth term as Federal Reserve chairman but instead would ''re-educate'' him. ''I want him once to go up to Capitol Hill and testify by saying, 'I must report to you that our economy is not sound because it has 20 percent child poverty and 47 million workers without a livable wage,' '' Mr. Nader said yesterday during a question-and-answer session at the National Press Club in Washington. Mr. Nader said he would consider replacing Mr. Greenspan with James Kenneth Galbraith, a University of Texas economist who has been critical of past increases in short-term interest rates.</p>
