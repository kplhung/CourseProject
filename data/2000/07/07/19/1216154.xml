        <p>Lee Elder had arrived at the DeWitt Clinton Park in midtown Manhattan to help promote a new program, the Chase Junior Golf Camps, a series of free lessons for New York City children 8 through 14. But all anyone wanted to talk about yesterday, from the news media to the youngsters, was Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Did Elder know Tiger? Was Elder Tiger's mentor? Does Elder think Tiger will win the British Open this weekend?</p>
        <p>Patiently and politely, Elder answered, yes, yes, yes.</p>

        <p>Lee Elder had arrived at the DeWitt Clinton Park in midtown Manhattan to help promote a new program, the Chase Junior Golf Camps, a series of free lessons for New York City children 8 through 14. But all anyone wanted to talk about yesterday, from the news media to the youngsters, was Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>Did Elder know Tiger? Was Elder Tiger's mentor? Does Elder think Tiger will win the British Open this weekend?</p>
        <p>Patiently and politely, Elder answered, yes, yes, yes.</p>
        <p>''He said I was one of his mentors and one of the biggest influences in his life,'' said Elder, who was the first black American to play in the Masters tournament. ''I certainly have spent hours and hours talking to him and watching him practice, not necessarily teaching him anything, but just watching his game.''</p>
        <p>The three-week, 90-minute golf camps, staffed by P.G.A.-certified professionals, will be held in 14 baseball fields around the city. Children will learn the essential skills of driving, pitching and putting.</p>
        <p>''I want to give them the opportunity I never had,'' Elder said. ''I want to see them enjoy the game and learn the game the proper way.''</p>

        <p>COWAN AND WASSEM SHARE LEAD: P. J. Cowan, who won titles in 1997 and 1998, and Heath Wassem, in only his second year as a head pro, each shot a two-under-par 68 yesterday to share the first-round lead in the MONY New York State Open at Bethpage State Park Black Course on Long Island.</p>
        <p>With slow play prevailing in the 54-hole tournament, three threesomes in the field of 136 players were unable to complete the first round. Following today's second 18 holes, the low 60 and ties advance to tomorrow's final.</p>
