        <p>COMPETITION has come to the market for traded stock options, and the customers may not be the winners.</p>
        <p>The four exchanges that trade stock options in this country became more aggressive last fall in seeking to trade options that had formerly been dominated by one exchange.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of that move, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, exulted that competition was narrowing the spread between bid and asked prices for listed options.</p>
        <p>''In four of the five actively traded options we examined, effective spreads have fallen between 22 and 44 percent since these options went from single exchange trading to multiple listings,'' Mr. Levitt said in a speech last September.</p>
        <p>But those declines were temporary. Since then, competition for options business has grown ever more steep -- but the competition has taken the form of paying brokers for order flow. Spreads appear to have widened, albeit not back to the previous levels. Today the S.E.C. will announce a new study aimed at determining whether payment for order flow is causing problems.</p>
        <p>For several months, the S.E.C. has sat by as the payment for order flow has intensified, to the irritation of many in the industry. Some who are paying for order flow are furious that the S.E.C. is not stopping others from doing so.</p>
        <p>''They are all saying, 'We abhor this practice, and we wouldn't do it if the S.E.C. would just stop us,' '' said one S.E.C. staffer in exasperation.</p>
        <p>Payment for order flow, long a practice in the stock market, provides a way for brokerage firms to profit from sending their orders to a particular place to be executed. Most of the electronic brokerage firms now collect such payments in the options markets, and other brokerage firms are beginning to look at getting such payments.</p>
        <p>There were no such payments in the options market until last fall in large part because there was little real competition in that market. Even when options were listed on more than one exchange, virtually all the business tended to be on one market. Orders went where there was liquidity, which was where the orders already were.</p>
        <p>That began to change last fall. The International Stock Exchange, a new exchange, announced plans to begin trading many options. (It did so in May, but so far has not had a very large impact.) In addition, the Justice Department antitrust division began showing interest in the options market. In short order, the existing exchanges began to show more interest in competition.</p>
        <p>The conventional wisdom then was that the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the leading market, would destroy the competition. In fact, it has lost market share, in large part because a number of specialist firms, which have operations on a number of exchanges, began to offer to pay for order flow.</p>
        <p>As it happens, the first to pay for order flow appears to have been Susquehanna Partners, which had taken responsibility for Microsoft options at the Chicago exchange. Microsoft options had been dominated by the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. Those payments began last fall, and enabled Chicago to gain substantial market share in those options.</p>
        <p>When Susquehanna began paying for order flow, it captured the attention of other exchanges. Soon other exchanges began offering major market makers, like Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg and Knight, as well as Susquehanna, the right to be the specialist on their exchanges in options that had not previously been traded on those exchanges. Some of those market makers were paying for order flow, and they brought in business. At exchanges, the specialists are the major players in any given option, but other local market makers also participate in the trading.</p>
        <p>''People thought multiple listing of options would be the death knell for us,'' Meyer Frucher, the chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, said yesterday. ''But it has proved to be the salvation.'' Mr. Frucher said he came to realize that in the changing options market it would be the specialist that would become the brand name, not the options exchange.</p>
        <p>Brokerage firms that do business with Susquehanna route orders to it to be traded at whichever market Susquehanna is the specialist. It is a  specialist in about 600 stocks, doing business at all four markets. Susquehanna officials declined to speak on the record about their business.</p>
        <p>As Chicago saw its market share begin to wither, it looked for ways to get some of it back. On July 6, it stunned competitors with its own plan. All market makers on the Chicago floor, whether the specialists or those in the crowd, will pay a fee of 40 cents per options contract, or 0.4 cents a share of stock covered by an option contract. That fee will go to the exchange, which will give it to specialists to use for marketing purposes, whether paying for order flow or putting out glossy brochures.</p>
        <p>Prior to that, the C.B.O.E. had been among the harshest critics of payment for order flow. But, said Edward J. Joyce, the exchange's president, it had no choice. ''If payment for order flow is going to be a factor, then we are going to compete on that front as well,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Chicago exchange was at a competitive disadvantage because many of its specialists are local firms that handle relatively few stocks and thus are less able to make deals with brokerage firms that do not want to make dozens of deals to route order flow in various stocks.</p>
        <p>To the amazement of other exchanges, the S.E.C. allowed that proposal to go into effect immediately, rather than suspending it while seeking comment for 60 days. To the S.E.C., it appears to have been a case of letting Chicago join the competition. To the other exchanges, it amounted to a new and dangerous type of competition -- one that involves the exchange itself collecting the marketing fees and that gets payments not just from the specialist but from all market makers operating in a stock.</p>
        <p>''Purchase of order flow by an exchange is an untested concept with uncertain ramifications,'' wrote Lanny A. Schwartz, the Philadelphia exchange's general counsel, in a letter to the S.E.C. ''The commission should carefully consider all aspects of the proposal before permitting its implementation.''</p>
        <p>Untested concept or not, Philadelphia announced last week that it would mimic the Chicago plan, but would pay $1 a contract, or two and a half times as much.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 21, 2000, Friday  The Market Place column in Business Day on Wednesday about changes in the market for stock options misstated the name of a new exchange that trades them. It is the International Securities Exchange, not the International Stock Exchange.</p>
