        <p>Manager Hired for Charter Schools</p>
        <p>The Learning Project, a nonprofit organization that works to improve education in low-income neighborhoods, has hired a former New York City private-school administrator to help it develop and manage charter schools. SUELLYN PRESTON SCULL, who was principal of the Trinity Upper School for 11 years, will help manage the John A. Reisenbach Charter School in Harlem, which became one of New York City's first two charter schools when it opened last fall. She will also help develop future charter schools, including the Newark Charter School, scheduled to open in September. ALICE GOLIN, former curriculum coordinator at the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, N.J., is joining the Learning Project as its curriculum coordinator.</p>

        <p>New Visions Graduates Are Off to College</p>
        <p>For the fourth straight year, the small experimental public schools sponsored by New Visions for Public Schools will send more than 80 percent of their graduates on to college. New Visions has created 35 small schools in New York City, including 23 with high-school grades, since 1993. This year, 554 of the 674 graduating students will be attending college, including Wesleyan, Spellman, Pennsylvania State University, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Hunter, Cornell, Bard, Sarah Lawrence and Tufts.</p>
        <p>Hunter and Barnard Win Science Grants</p>
        <p>As scientists map the genome and investigate individual genes, colleges are racing to keep up. One place they turn for financial help is the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. This month the institute chose 53 colleges and universities -- including five in New York and two in Connecticut -- from among 204 applicants to receive grants.</p>
        <p>Hunter College, one of the winners, will use part of its $1.3 million grant for an intensive summer training program for high school science teachers that will also pay for equipment and supplies they can take back to their high schools, said SHIRLEY RAPS, chairwoman of biological sciences at Hunter. ELIZABETH S. BOYLAN, provost and acting president at Barnard College, another winner, said Barnard would use some of its $1.1 million grant for programs to attract educationally disadvantaged students.</p>
        <p>Superintendent Chosen in Queens</p>
        <p>Community School Board 29 has chosen RHIA WARREN, principal of Intermediate School 226 in South Ozone Park, to be the new superintendent of the district, which covers southeastern Queens. But Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who has a month to approve the selection, has hinted in recent months that he wants MICHAEL JOHNSON, left, the acting superintendent, for the job permanently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy appointed Mr. Johnson in February after suspending the community school board, saying it had broken the rules for selecting a new superintendent. But while Mr. Johnson has won the support of many parents, a search committee did not include him on a list of five finalists for the permanent job. School board members, reinstated several months ago, have said that Mr. Johnson lacks administrative experience.</p>
