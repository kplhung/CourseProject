        <p>Never mind that Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has been busy backing popular Republican election-year bills to cut taxes and provide prescription drugs to the elderly. Today he took up the cudgels to deal with something that really keeps his Illinois constituents up at night, tossing and turning.</p>
        <p>In a rare appearance as a star witness at a Congressional hearing, the speaker led a parade of critics who attacked a proposed federal regulation that would require trains to blow their horns at railroad crossings, a step to help avoid accidents with cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>''The impact of the rule on my constituents and the people of Illinois  cannot be understated,'' Mr. Hastert told a House Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Many states have already adopted similar rules. But, in a clash between public safety and quality of life, a squadron of legislators and civic leaders complained today that the federal regulation, while well meaning, would unleash a never-ending cacophony of klaxons in hundreds of cities, towns and hamlets situated along rail lines.</p>
        <p>''Crossings along many lines are located so closely together that train engineers might as well tape the horn button down: there will be simply no break in the noise,'' said Miguel d'Escoto, deputy chief of staff to Chicago's mayor, Richard M. Daley.  ''The mental stress and strain on our residents will be unimaginable.''</p>
        <p>More than 400 people a year die in collisions at crossings. Half the fatalities occur at crossings equipped with gates and flashing lights, which  drivers sometimes ignore.</p>
        <p>To address the hazard, Congress passed legislation in 1994 mandating that trains toot their horns as they approach crossings. But it was only this January, after several delays, that the Federal Railroad Administration published the proposed rule to carry out the law. The proposal is now being subjected to a period of public comment, and the railroad agency hopes to have the issue resolved by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, 34 states and scores of local communities have  already approved their own horn-blowing statutes, which incorporate  alternatives that localities can adopt to maintain peace and quiet while promoting safety at the crossings.</p>
        <p>The railroad agency has questioned some of those options, citing a 1995 study that showed crashes were  84 percent more likely to occur at crossings where whistles were banned than at crossings where they were sounded routinely.</p>
        <p>Wherever there are passenger or freight trains, from Long Island and New Jersey to San Diego, the issue of horns versus harmony has roiled communities. But nowhere else is the matter so contentious as in and around Chicago, the hub of the nation's rail operations.</p>
        <p>Chicago transportation experts say that under the federal rule, train whistles blaring at deafening levels would rattle about 725,000 residents of the city, with the brunt of the assault falling on poor neighborhoods near the tracks.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Hastert, his Congressional district, Illinois's 14th, just west of Chicago, is home to one of every five railroad crossings in the state.</p>
        <p>The proposed rule would permit a variety of alternatives to the horn-blowing, including four-gate crossings and median barriers. But Mr. Hastert and other critics of the rule want the agency to give communities even greater flexibility in devising quieter options.</p>
        <p>John V. Wells, the agency's administrator, suggested that he was ready to work with the critics. ''There are many ways to skin this cat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But many of the options are costly, and would be a drain on the coffers of small rural hamlets and suburban towns. A flashing-signal system can cost $60,000, the Transportation Department says, and a gate across one lane $15,000 -- to say nothing of an overpass, which can run $2 million to $3 million.</p>
        <p>Critics warn that even as states like Illinois move to replace simple ''crossbuck'' railroad crossing signs, the financing to fix the most dangerous rail-auto intersections, many in rural areas, may be siphoned away if the horn rule results in an abundance of spending on alternatives in urban areas.</p>
        <p>''The proposed rule could actually have the unintended consequence of decreasing rail safety,'' Mr. Hastert said. ''Public pressure to shield highly populated communities from noise will undoubtedly overcome the need to upgrade the dangerous crossings.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 25, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Wednesday about a proposed federal regulation requiring trains to blow their horns at railroad crossings misstated the title of John V. Wells at the Federal Railroad Administration. He is deputy administrator, not administrator.</p>
