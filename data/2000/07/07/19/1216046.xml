        <p>The Nasdaq composite index fell sharply yesterday as investors chose to take profits after pushing the technology-laden index higher in each of the previous four sessions.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq fell 97.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,177.17. While the decline in Nasdaq stocks was most pronounced, other major market gauges also moved lower.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,739.92, led lower by Intel, which fell 35/16, to 143. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 16.75 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,493.74. General Electric, Pfizer and Lucent Technologies were among the big losers. And the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks fell 8.90, or 1.6 percent, to 536.28.</p>
        <p>Traders and analysts said the decline in prices, which came on moderate volume, was warranted.</p>
        <p>''The market has had a very nice move up over the last month or so, especially technology stocks, and the averages and individual stocks are very overbought,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. ''It is time to consolidate.''</p>
        <p>Contributing to the slide in Nasdaq were Qualcomm, JDS Uniphase and Cisco Systems, which all fell by more than 2 points. In the previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Although Intel fell during the day, it reported second-quarter results that were better than expected after the market closed and rallied as high as 147 after hours. It was not the only big company to issue an earnings report after the close of trading.</p>
        <p>Microsoft and Apple Computer, two other technology heavyweights, also reported results that were better than expected.</p>
        <p>The earnings numbers led some analysts to suggest that yesterday's sell-off may be short lived.</p>
        <p>''My guess is there will be a bounce on Wednesday,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company in Boston. ''The market has moved a lot in the last week, and there was room to take profits. But when we start focusing on these great earnings numbers, I think we will see buying again.''</p>
        <p>Three stocks fell for every two that rose on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. About 910 million shares changed hands on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>Some stocks, which had advanced smartly in advance of earnings reports that were expected to be good, retreated once the news was announced.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch, which rose 10 percent last week, was hit hard yesterday even though it reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates. Merrill fell 3 3/4, to 128 1/4.</p>
        <p>Aetna was another big loser. The nation's biggest health insurer fell 6 15/16, to 59 11/16, after it reported results that fell short of estimates.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Treasury Prices Rise</p>
        <p>(By Reuters) -- Treasury prices were little changed yesterday after the government's latest consumer price report raised no inflation alarms and did little to alter investors' outlook on the economy and interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics said a spike in energy prices pushed the June Consumer Price Index, a broad measure of prices at the consumer level, up 0.6 percent in June.</p>
        <p>The core rate, which is the index without its more volatile food and energy items, rose just 0.2 percent, matching the market consensus.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year bond rose 4/32, to 104 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.90 percent from 5.91 percent on Monday.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 102 19/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 6.14 percent.</p>
