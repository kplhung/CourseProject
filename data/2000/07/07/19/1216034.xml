      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jodie Gaines Johnson was kidnapped, held captive for five days without water or food and raped repeatedly by three men.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know the criminal system, I was just thrown in there,'' Ms. Johnson said of the process that led to her captors' conviction. ''And my perpetrators are now starting to be paroled. I want to know when they're paroled. I have four kids, and I don't want to be in the grocery store and run into them. I'm not that strong.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson was one of more than a dozen victims, relatives of victims and law enforcement officers who told their stories today to Vice President Al Gore as he sought to highlight a package on crime prevention that he is proposing in his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Central to his package is a constitutional amendment -- similar to one that the Clinton administration opposed -- that would guarantee certain rights to victims like Ms. Johnson, among them the right to be notified of a convict's release and the right to have their own safety considered in determining any conditional release.</p>
        <p>In addition, the amendment Mr. Gore proposes would give victims the right to be heard at sentencing, the right to be included in any public proceedings related to the crime, the right to restitution from a convicted offender and the right to a trial without unreasonable delay.</p>
        <p>''The accused criminals have all kinds of rights, and we all understand why that is important,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But here is the point: When those rights are enshrined in the Constitution and the rights of victims are not, whenever the two come into any kind of a conflict, it is not even a close contest. The victims are put in the back seat and sometimes even ignored.''</p>
        <p>The amendment, part of the victims' bill of rights that Mr. Gore proposed today, would allow victims to leave work to attend legal proceedings, much the way jurors are excused from work. Mr. Gore said his measure would cost $685 million over 10 years and would be paid for with money from the projected budget surplus.</p>
        <p>The proposed amendment is based on legislation that the administration had worked to defeat, in part because officials were concerned that excessive victims' rights might interfere with fair trials.</p>
        <p>Senator Jon Kyl, the Arizona Republican who, with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, has sponsored such an amendment, said in a conference call with reporters today that Mr. Gore had ''been AWOL from this fight.''</p>
        <p>The briefing by Mr. Kyl, who said he was irked that Mr. Gore was trying to get credit for something that the administration had blocked, was arranged by the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>The senator said the administration had insisted that the rights of criminals would never be ''subservient'' to the rights of victims. ''They basically said that in the case of a tie the defendant always had to win,'' Mr. Kyl said. ''It bothers me now that Al Gore is trying to use this politically and in a fraudulent way, because he's never been helpful.''</p>
        <p>Being tough on crime is a central piece of the New Democrat approach to policy that Mr. Gore -- and President Clinton, for that matter -- has long embraced. Both support the death penalty. ''I want to be a law enforcement president,'' Mr. Gore said today.</p>
        <p>The Democratic National Committee began running a television commercial last week in 17 states that shows Mr. Gore promoting the constitutional amendment and victims' rights. He says, among other things, that victims should have the right to speak at the trial of the accused.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kyl said that few people supported this idea. He also said his proposed amendment, which is considered dead for the year, did not guarantee the right of an employee to attend a trial, that is, to be excused from work, but did guarantee that a victim could not be excluded from a trial.</p>
        <p>Thirty-two states have laws that give victims the right to be heard in court, though usually at the time of sentencing and not when a jury is considering guilt or innocence.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kyl said he had 41 other sponsors for his proposed constitutional amendment, altering the Constitution is difficult at best.</p>
        <p>Opponents of new constitutional amendments say that this method of social correction is overused as a political remedy to complex problems and that in this case, it could easily delay trials and interfere with plea bargains.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Mr. Gore supported another proposed constitutional amendment, the Equal Rights Amendment. He was not in Congress when that amendment was passed in 1972, but, after the states failed to ratify it, he did vote in 1983 for the amendment to be revived.</p>
        <p>Later, he opposed a constitutional amendment on the flag. In 1989, when he was in the Senate, he voted for legislation to protect the flag from desecration, and in 1990 voted against a constitutional amendment to protect the flag.</p>
        <p>''I've always been very reluctant to support a constitutional amendment,'' Mr. Gore told the victims who were gathered here at Rhodes College today by the Gore campaign. ''I think that our founders did a great job, but they anticipated that there would be times when we would have to amend their handiwork, and this is one such time. I feel very strongly about it.''</p>
        <p>He told the victims, ''No one should have to go through what you went through,'' referring not only to the initial crime but also to ''what you experienced in the aftermath of the crime, entering the criminal justice system that sometimes treated you as an afterthought instead of as a central participant in criminal justice system, deserving of protection, just as much as those who are accused of having committed a crime against you.''</p>
