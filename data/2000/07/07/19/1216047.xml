        <p>The Senate is unlikely to vote on the China trade bill before Congress adjourns next week, delaying the vote at least until September, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said today.</p>
        <p>The bill would grant China permanent normal trade relations with the United States, ending the current situation in which Congress decides annually whether to renew China's trade status.</p>
        <p>''It would be very hard to get a final vote before the recess,'' Senator Lott said, ''if all of the options available to those that oppose the bill exercised them, because there are several points where delay could occur -- filibusters could occur.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lott said it was still possible that senators could begin debating the measure as early as next Wednesday and wrap it up once the Senate returns after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott minimized warnings by some of the bill's advocates who say that delaying a final vote is risky, and he insisted that the Senate would eventually approve the trade measure by an overwhelmingly margin. The House passed the measure, 237 to 197, on May 24.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe delay is dangerous, and certainly not fatal,'' Mr. Lott said, adding that ''the overwhelming majority of the Senate'' supported the bill.</p>
        <p>''The headline is going to read, sometime here in the next month: 'Senate Passes China Trade Bill,' '' he said. ''And I don't think there's going to be any significant change or any way to stop that.''</p>
        <p>Business leaders, who are traditional Republican allies, have been critical of Mr. Lott for putting one of their top legislative priorities in jeopardy. They fear that postponing the final vote could expose the bill to unforeseen impediments.</p>
        <p>Right now, though, the top priority for Senate Republicans has been to pass two tax-cutting measures and as many of the 13 annual spending bills to finance the government as possible before the Republican National Convention, which begins at the end of this month.</p>
        <p>With at least 70 senators prepared to vote for the measure, associates of Mr. Lott say he feels that he has the luxury of using the timing of the vote as leverage to wring concessions from Senate Democrats and the White House on the spending bills.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has privately urged Mr. Lott to schedule a final vote as soon as possible, but White House aides have not attacked the majority leader for the delay.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the delay has been that supporters are trying to pass a version identical to the House bill. If any amendments are tacked on in the Senate, the differences will have to be ironed out in a conference committee and the whole measure returned to the House for a second and potentially volatile vote.</p>
        <p>Senate and administration aides have worked fruitlessly in the last week to work out a compromise on a measure sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Their measure would require the administration to monitor China's record on the spread of nuclear weapons. It would impose sanctions on Beijing if there was ''credible evidence'' of exports of certain types of prohibited weaponry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton would have discretion to waive some penalties, but others would be automatic. The administration and business leaders have opposed the measure, even after Mr. Thompson agreed to water down several provisions.</p>
        <p>Other senators, including Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, and Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, have said they want to offer amendments dealing with China's record on human rights, labor standards and national security.</p>
        <p>''Most disturbing,'' said Mr. Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ''are those who want to prevent Congress from even addressing these national security questions during the P.N.T.R. debate, for fear that it will complicate what amounts to a single-minded, dollar-driven crusade to make certain this trade deal is approved in the Senate.''</p>
