        <p>On his 34th birthday, Dan O'Brien said today that he had suffered a foot injury that would almost certainly keep him out of the Olympic track and field trials and prevent him from defending his gold medal in the decathlon.</p>
        <p>While practicing the high jump last Wednesday at Washington State University, O'Brien said, he suffered a partial tear of the plantar fascia, a bundle of connective tissue that runs along the bottom of his left foot. The injury has reduced him to a painful jog, he said, adding that there was a 98 or 99 percent chance he would not compete when the decathlon begins Thursday.</p>
