      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli has all but officially declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor, setting off a pitched battle with Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, the party's nominee in 1997, for the support of officials across New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The showdown between two longtime allies has thrown the state's Democratic Party into turmoil just when it seemed to be recovering from a divisive Senate primary, and is raising concerns that the distraction could hobble its performance in the November elections.</p>
        <p>Today, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee for Senate, rescinded his earlier endorsement of Mr. McGreevey, saying in an internal campaign memo that he would remain neutral, and acknowledging that his  campaign aides and advisers were caught in the middle of the gubernatorial fight.</p>
        <p>In a time-compressed replay of the geographical jockeying for support that went on during the Senate race between Mr. Corzine and Jim Florio, Mr. Torricelli and Mr. McGreevey are carving up New Jersey county by county, racing to lock up and reconfirm commitments from countless Democratic chairmen and financiers, freeholders and mayors, union leaders and influential ministers. The maneuvering is severely testing the loyalties of those officials, as well as political consultants and staff members for both men.</p>
        <p>It is still unclear who has the upper hand. Advisers to Mr. Torricelli and Mr. McGreevey are both claiming broad-based support.</p>
        <p>''The focus is on who would be the best candidate to be the nominee of the Democratic Party for governor,'' said Jamie Fox, director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which Mr. Torricelli heads. ''The vast majority of the leadership of the party in New Jersey believe it's Bob Torricelli.''</p>
        <p>But one side must be grossly exaggerating its support, or party officials are telling both men what they want to hear. For example, in Essex County, a key battleground that has the most enrolled Democrats, Mr. Torricelli and Mr. McGreevey are both claiming the support of Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, State Senator Richard Codey and Thomas Giblin, the county and state Democratic chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. James, who met with Mr. Torricelli on Monday, did not respond to two phone messages. Neither Mr. Codey nor Mr. Giblin would reveal whom he was supporting. But two McGreevey supporters said Mr. Codey told them today that he had reiterated his support for Mr. McGreevey in a conversation with Mr. Torricelli this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's camp is telling wavering Democrats that he has the support of roughly two-thirds of the counties in the state, including five of the seven counties in South Jersey. But supporters of Mr. McGreevey claim that in the south, only Camden and Burlington Counties are backing Mr. Torricelli, suggesting that his supposed groundswell of support is really a colossal bluff.</p>
        <p>Tellingly, few Democrats would clearly take sides today, or even speak for the record. But many were talking plenty all the same.</p>
        <p>Those who favor Mr. Torricelli say he is the best-known, most powerful and most electable Democrat in New Jersey. Next to Mr. McGreevey, one senior party official said, ''it's like Mark McGwire versus the home run king of the Pee Wee League.''</p>
        <p>But Brad Lawrence, a consultant to Mr. McGreevey whose firm is also working for Mr. Corzine, said Mr. Torricelli, whose 1996 campaign fund-raising operation has drawn the scrutiny of federal prosecutors, would be more vulnerable to attack. ''We know the microscopic scrutiny that Jim went under in 1997, and we know he survived it rather well,'' Mr. Lawrence said. ''There are no dark secrets out there. I think we can withstand the scrutiny of this process better than the senator can.''</p>
        <p>Other supporters of Mr. McGreevey, who has become ubiquitous at union halls, churches and political functions, say he would fare better than Mr. Torricelli because of the emphasis on retail politicking in a primary.</p>
        <p>''Torricelli has never fought a retail game in his life,'' said a state legislator backing Mr. McGreevey. ''This is hand to hand. This isn't like fighting a TV war in 1996. McGreevey's hitting the streets, working 18 hours a day. That's not what Torricelli likes, nor has he done it.''</p>
        <p>But a labor leader who is still neutral in the race said union officials in New Jersey would find it difficult to oppose a sitting United States senator with two years left in his term, no matter how assiduously Mr. McGreevey had courted their support over the last few years.</p>
        <p>Why Mr. Torricelli chose this time to enter the race is also up for debate, although he has been interested in the office for years. Those who have spoken to Mr. Torricelli say he is looking ahead to November and calculating that Vice President Al Gore will lose the presidential race.  That would make him eager to leave Washington and run for governor, they say. And, better to signal his interest now than to spring it on Mr. McGreevey and the rest of the party after the election results are in.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey's $3.2 million fund-raiser three weeks ago may also have aroused Mr. Torricelli's competitiveness. ''Governor is a powerful job, and Torricelli perceives that his dominance in the party would change in the event that someone else were governor,'' said one Democratic associate of both men. ''Once you've got the governor's office, the governor has all the chips. Does Bob Torricelli strike you as someone who wants someone else to have all the chips, if he has a choice in the matter?''</p>
