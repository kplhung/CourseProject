        <p>Hardly anyone in Congress is interested in who owns the gas and electric lines on military bases.</p>
        <p>But one influential politician is paying close attention to the arcane question. He is Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado, and this is important for two reasons.</p>
        <p>First, the city-owned utility in his hometown, Colorado Springs, wants to overturn a new Pentagon policy that requires the armed forces to seek competitive bids from private operators to run the electricity, gas, water and sewer services on their bases.</p>
        <p>Second, because he is chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Installations and Facilities, Mr. Hefley was able to insert a tiny provision in a mammoth Defense Department bill, passed by the House in May, that the Pentagon believes would have the effect of thwarting its policy.</p>
        <p>If the measure becomes law, said Randall Yim, deputy under secretary of defense for installations, it will force the military services over the next few years to spend large amounts of money to bring their utilities up to standard, money that he said could be better spent on pressing military needs.</p>
        <p>The Senate passed its version of the military bill on Thursday without the Hefley provision, so the matter will have to be resolved by a House-Senate conference committee.</p>
        <p>The word in Congress is that Mr. Hefley will have a distinct advantage in the negotiations. This is what in legislative jargon is called a member's issue, a senior staff member explained. In other words, Mr. Hefley cares a great deal about the matter. No one with similar authority in the Senate has the same degree of interest. So there is an excellent chance Mr. Hefley will prevail.</p>
        <p>The issue arose because at bases across the country, the water pipes are crumbling, the electrical wiring does not meet safety codes, gas lines are prone to leaks and the sewers tend to back up. The cost of upgrading these systems, which are owned by the armed forces, is far beyond what the Pentagon has ever had the nerve to request or Congress has been willing to provide.</p>
        <p>So three years ago, the Defense Department proposed and Congress quickly adopted, without opposition and without debate, a new policy under which the utilities on military bases would be turned over to private contractors.</p>
        <p>The idea was that companies would bid against one another for contracts to improve the pipes and poles and pumps and wiring. In return, the government would pay the companies an annual fee to provide utility services under a long-term arrangement.</p>
        <p>This seemed to be an especially appealing prospect to a Republican Congress committed to competitive private business and smaller government.</p>
        <p>Some large companies, notably the Enron Corporation, the Houston-based energy company, quickly began to seek the business of running utilities on military bases.</p>
        <p>Across the country, more than 100 bases have put their utilities out for bid, and about a dozen contracts have been awarded.</p>
        <p>Enron, for instance, won a $26 million contract to serve Fort Hamilton, the Brooklyn Army base, for the next 10 years. In return, Enron agreed to spend $11 million over the next year upgrading the base's electric, gas, water and drainage systems.</p>
        <p>But soon after the policy was enacted, many local utility companies, which are regulated by the states, began to complain that the  policy treated them unfairly.</p>
        <p>Some argued that state laws gave them the sole right to run the utilities in their area of jurisdiction once the military relinquished ownership. Others maintained that state regulations limited their services -- preventing, for example, the electric company from providing gas -- and that this put them at a disadvantage in bidding against an unregulated company like Enron, which could offer all the different utilities.</p>
        <p>Colorado Springs Utilities, a city-owned, state-regulated company, for instance, holds that it has the sole authority under state law to provide gas, water and electricity at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy.</p>
        <p>When Fort Carson, a large Army base, sought bids on its utility services last year, Colorado Springs Utilities filed a lawsuit maintaining that state law gave it a monopoly in the area. The government responded that federal law was dominant on federal property. The suit is pending in Federal District Court.</p>
        <p>The section Mr. Hefley inserted into the military bill would require all utilities' contracts to comply with state laws and regulations, a requirement that critics said would stifle competition. The overall bill is so large -- it authorizes more than $300 billion in Pentagon programs for the next fiscal year and covers matters  as different as military pay and missile defense -- that little notice of Mr. Hefley's provision was taken.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to see how parties will reach a compromise that will satisfy the Pentagon, regulated utility companies like the one in Colorado Springs and private competitors like Enron.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hefley said in an interview that he would work in the conference committee to find language acceptable to all sides. The House and Senate will be able to vote only on the conference agreement on the overall bill and will never vote just on the utilities matter.</p>
        <p>''I've always believed in privatization and open bidding,'' Mr. Hefley said. ''It was certainly not my intention to gut that.''</p>
        <p>As for Colorado Springs Utilities, Mr. Hefley said he was not out to protect his local company from competition. But he added, ''It would seem to me they are in the best position of all to make the best bid.''</p>
