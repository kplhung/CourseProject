        <p>The chairman of New Jersey's Parole Board, caught up in criticism of delays in parole hearings for hundreds of inmates and allegations of favorable treatment for a few others, said yesterday that he would resign by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>The chairman, Andrew B. Consovoy, who is 52 and has a history of heart trouble, said his doctor had advised him to stop working.

        <p>The chairman of New Jersey's Parole Board, caught up in criticism of delays in parole hearings for hundreds of inmates and allegations of favorable treatment for a few others, said yesterday that he would resign by the end of the week.</p>
        <p>The chairman, Andrew B. Consovoy, who is 52 and has a history of heart trouble, said his doctor had advised him to stop working. ''I have to listen to my doctor,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home, where he has been on sick leave for about a month. ''It seems like an ideal time to take it easy. I just want to relax and enjoy my kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy also acknowledged that a factor in his decision was a  continuing investigation by the state attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., of Mr. Consovoy's involvement in the parole of at least three inmates since 1993, including a judge's son and two men reputed to be members of organized crime.</p>
        <p>Last month, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said she wanted explanations of allegations in news reports this spring that Mr. Consovoy had given favorable treatment to those inmates. In the past, he has denied any wrongdoing, and would not discuss the cases yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy was appointed to the Parole Board in 1988, and Mrs. Whitman named him chairman in 1998.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mrs. Whitman, Pete McDonough, would not comment on Mr. Consovoy's decision to step down. ''We haven't heard it from him,'' he said. But officials in the Whitman administration are known to be upset with Mr. Consovoy, and have criticized his underreporting of a backlog in parole hearings for prisoners eligible for release. In a report to the attorney general's office in May, the Parole Board said the backlog consisted of 303 cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer's office then reviewed the board's files and reported on July 10 that the actual figure was 2,201. It also said 469 other prisoners who had received hearings were still awaiting a decision on parole, and 145 others who had been granted parole were still awaiting release from prison.  Mr. Consovoy would not discuss the discrepancies yesterday.</p>
        <p>In May, several inmates caught up in the backlog filed a class-action suit in federal court in Camden, N.J.,  contending that the state had violated their rights under New Jersey's parole law.</p>
        <p>In mid-June, Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff, Michael Torpey, summoned Mr. Consovoy to his office for what Mr. McDonough later called a ''very serious and frank'' discussion. Shortly afterward, Mr. Consovoy took a medical leave from his $92,750-a-year position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Consovoy said he would formally submit his resignation papers in a few days after finishing up details on his state pension and future medical benefits. He suggested that he was eager to placate his critics.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to offend anyone,'' he said. ''I want to leave on real nice terms.''</p>
