        <p>Christophe Benoit is spending three weeks in July traveling around France on a four-wheel motorcycle inside a huge pot of a pork-flavored pate. Mohamet, who declines to give any last name, is making the same journey inside a can of butane gas. Philippe Chapuis is going sometimes on roller skates, sometimes in the back of a car in the white doughboy garb of Bibendum, the Michelin man.</p>
        <p>The three, and 600 co-workers, are part of an enormous advertising convoy that precedes the Tour de France, as the world's greatest bicycle race takes three weeks to circumnavigate more than 2,200 miles of France as well as slices of Switzerland and Germany.</p>
        <p>All along the way, 40 European companies will spend millions of dollars for the opportunity to acquaint a huge audience with their products or, as detractors put it, litter the roads with junk. There are lots of products: Each of 200 vehicles distributes at least 5,000 items a day, or 20 million by the end of the race in Paris on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Some companies distribute many more gifts. ''We give away 20,000 bags a day, or 400,000 by the end of the race,'' said Daniel Isaac, director of communications for Credit Lyonnais, the big French bank. ''We've been a partner of the Tour for 20 years,'' he added, and the sponsor of the overall leader's yellow jersey. ''It's very important for our image.''</p>
        <p>The gifts are as varied as the givers. An off-track betting system, the Pari Mutuel Urbain, distributes oversized green cardboard hands. One of the country's trade union confederations, Force Ouvriere, gives out yo-yo's.</p>
        <p>Michelin provides caps for many of the 15 million spectators watching the race along the roads. France Telecom also has caps.</p>
        <p>The Champion supermarket chain is pleased to give a guide to many sports, not including bicycle racing. Cochonou, a sausage company, offers the obvious, as do Coeur de Lion, a cheese merchant, and Haribo, a candy maker. Credit Lyonnais' cloth swag bag for these goodies is matched by the newspaper Ouest France, but its bag, while bigger than the bank's, is made of plastic. La Redoute, a mail-order department store chain, supplies screens to shield car windows from the summer sun.</p>
        <p>''Nobody can give just a piece of paper,'' said Jean-Pierre Lachaud, who has directed the publicity caravan's operations since 1989. ''But an object of some value with a piece of paper, that's O.K.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lachaud works with 10 assistants to run the caravan's operations, using a radio-equipped plane to make sure that the vehicles are spaced correctly. ''Since 1989, we've made the caravan roll in staggered formation so that journalists' cars can get through,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For safety, all objects are supposed to be handed to spectators, not just dropped on the road. Nevertheless, many are flung into the crowd and wind up in traffic, where young and old may dart heedlessly to retrieve them. A 12-year-old boy died on Sunday, a few days after he was hit by a vehicle as the caravan passed; it was the first such death reported in a dozen years.</p>
        <p>The vehicles of the 40 advertisers, up from 36 last year, do not include 35 more cars and trucks that sell magazines, newspapers and T-shirts. Few salesmen follow the bicycle race itself because spectators go home once the riders have passed.</p>
        <p>The caravan dates to 1930, when the Tour switched from teams sponsored by companies, mainly bicycle manufacturers, to national teams. While the teams that were commercially supported paid a fee to enter, the national teams did not, and Tour de France officials decided that income had to be increased. When commercially supported teams were reintroduced in the 1960's, the caravan was such a big part of the event that it was retained.</p>
        <p>''The exposure is so important,'' said Isabelle Cohen, a marketing official for a coffee company, CAFT, which distributes thousands of small cups of coffee at the start of the day's riding and packets of beans en route. ''There are lots of brands of coffee and we hope buyers will identify ours as the Tour de France coffee,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Supporters think that the caravan helps entertain and enliven the crowd when it passes an hour before the riders. ''None of the gifts are very important, just little souvenirs, but fun,'' said Isabelle Colombeau, a teacher, as she waited for the caravan recently with her mother, father and brother. Nearby, a small child bawled, having been beaten by an adult to a leaflet from Cofidis, a telephone credit service.</p>
        <p>The Colombeau family was especially pleased with its haul of key rings from TotalFina Elf, the merged French oil company, and small pots of rillettes, or pork pate from Bordeau Chesnel, the employer of Mr. Benoit in his oversized mock pot.</p>
        <p>Each advertiser is charged a total of 130,000 French francs -- more than $18,000 -- for the first three vehicles and 30,000 francs for each additional one, according to Florence Maire of the Tour's marketing department. While most advertisers have three or four vehicles, the insurer AGF reinforces its cars with a squadron of young women on motorcycles.</p>
        <p>Many companies employ young women to sit in the back of an open car all day, no matter what the weather, and wave to the fans or swing their arms to the disco beat pulsing from an adjoining loudspeaker as a young man pitches objects from the front seat. That amounts to a lot of waving and swinging as the average daily stage of the race is 105 miles in four or five hours.</p>
        <p>Still, the workers appear to enjoy their work. Although their pay by the advertisers is minimal, they say, they receive free room and board plus a chance to see the country and do a bit of partying once the caravan is parked for the night.</p>
        <p>And, if they stay at it long enough, as Chapuis, the Michelin man, has done, there is the ultimate honor: A week ago he was awarded the Medal of the Tour de France for 20 years' service and devotion to the race. The millions at the sides of the many roads simply thought he was waving at them.</p>
