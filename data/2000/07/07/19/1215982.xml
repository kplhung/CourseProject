        <p>A GOOD bottle of Beaujolais, fruity and undemanding, bypasses the analytical portion of the brain and heads directly to the pleasure center. This wine is versatile with food and thirst-quenching -- gulpable, as they say.</p>
        <p>Though Beaujolais enjoys its moment in the spotlight every November, when the newly bottled nouveaus are shipped, it is, in fact, a perfect hot-weather red.</p>
        <p>One reason for that is that Beaujolais tastes great lightly chilled, about half an hour in the refrigerator before serving. And it goes with almost anything, from burgers to fried chicken to Indian takeout food.</p>
        <p>But the best thing about Beaujolais is its easy, open nature. If Burgundy is a mysterious, inscrutable cat of a wine and Bordeaux a beautiful thoroughbred, Beaujolais is simply a good pooch, young, frisky and eager to please.</p>
        <p>Of the many breeds of Beaujolais, Georges Duboeuf is the best known and most popular. Most Duboeuf wines are light, fruity and stylistically consistent, though I found his 1998 Julienas to have more depth than usual.</p>
        <p>Louis Jadot, a big name in Burgundy and Beaujolais, makes wines more muted than Mr. Duboeuf's but no less pleasing.</p>
        <p>Smaller producers are more idiosyncratic, a little more expensive, but can be more exciting, making handcrafted wines that add texture and richness without compromising the basic Beaujolais likability.</p>
        <p>Clos de la Roilette from Coudert, for example, is a wine that you may not find on every corner but rewards the hunt. The Granger, Bertolla and Michaud, too, are worth seeking out.</p>
        <p>Even though these wines have more dimensions to them, they are still light in spirit, joyous rather than weighty. You wouldn't retire to the library to drink Beaujolais. It's for the kitchen table, and certainly for outdoors.</p>
        <p>COUDERT PERE ET FILS , CLOS DE LA ROILETTE , FLEURIE 1998: $15  Firm, fresh, fruity and full of pleasure.</p>
        <p>. . .  PASCAL GRANGER , JULIENAS 1998: $13.50  Lush texture, soft yet concentrated with an extended finish.</p>
        <p>. . .  ALFRED GINO BERTOLLA , DOMAINE DU GRANIT , MOULIN-A -VENT 1998: $15  Layers of persistent fruit flavors.</p>
        <p>. . .  LOUIS JADOT , BEAUJOLAIS -VILLAGES 1998: $7.50  Lively and sweet; fruity yet with some heft.</p>
        <p>. . .  ALAIN MICHAUD , BROUILLY 1998: $14  A mouthful of smooth fruit, light and delightful.</p>
        <p>. . .  GEORGES DUBOEUF , JULIENAS , FLOWER LABEL 1998: $10  Potent, structured, rich and pleasing.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
