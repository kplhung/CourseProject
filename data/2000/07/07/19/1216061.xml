        <p>An Army investigation of events surrounding the murder of a gay private by a fellow soldier at a base in Kentucky has exonerated all officers of blame and has concluded that no climate of homophobia existed at the base, Pentagon officials said today.</p>
        <p>Last July, Pfc. Barry Winchell, 21, was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat as he slept in his barracks at Fort Campbell. A 19-year-old private, Calvin Glover, was later court-martialed and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.</p>
        <p>Specialist Justin R. Fisher, 26, Private Winchell's roommate, was sentenced to 12 1/2 years as part of a plea bargain that allowed him to avoid more serious charges of being an accomplice to the murder and helping to cover it up.</p>
        <p>The Army, stung by accusations that it was not punishing soldiers who harass gays, opened an investigation into the atmosphere at Fort Campbell.</p>
        <p>The conclusion of that investigation, conducted by the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael W. Ackerman, and expected to be released on Friday, states that some members of the unit in which the killing took place, a company within the 101st Airborne Division, held anti-gay attitudes.</p>
        <p>In particular, the report singled out Private Winchell's first sergeant, who has since been relieved of his duties, for not ending the harassment.</p>
        <p>But the report, whose findings were first reported by CBS News, also concluded that the 101st Airborne does not suffer from an unacceptable degree of homophobia, officials said.</p>
        <p>Rather, the report described a sort of upstairs-downstairs mentality at the base in which instances of harassment were not brought to the attention of those in command who might have stopped them.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot of times when the problem never surfaced up the chain of command,'' said one Pentagon official. ''But when the leadership discovered the problem, action was taken.''</p>
        <p>Private Winchell's mother, Patricia Kutteles, a registered nurse from Kansas City, Mo., was quick to accuse the Army of a cover-up.</p>
        <p>''I'm just so disappointed, really, really disappointed,'' Ms. Kutteles said today in a telephone interview. ''It's been so devastating. To me it seems as if the Pentagon brass and the Fort Campbell command are more concerned about protecting themselves than the safety of our soldiers. The Army should face up to what is going on instead of covering up for the command climate.''</p>
        <p>She has filed a claim against the Army under the Military Claims Act for wrongful death and is seeking $1.4 million in damages.</p>
        <p>Michelle M. Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to gays in the military, also criticized the pending report.</p>
        <p>''If the Army report denies anti-gay harassment is a problem at Fort Campbell, then the report does not have a shred of credibility,'' Ms. Benecke said. ''There is more than ample evidence of anti-gay harassment, despite a process that foreclosed the participation of gay soldiers. Army leaders need to deal with this problem head on, and stop the harassment.''</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials today defended the pending report. ''I'm not saying that harassment hasn't occurred,'' a Pentagon official said. ''But it is an exaggeration to think that every gay at the base is being harassed.''</p>
        <p>The Army investigation coincided with a second report by a advisory group created by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen after the Pentagon's inspector general said last March that harassment of servicemen perceived to be gay was widespread throughout the military.</p>
        <p>That report was supposed to serve as an ''action plan'' for each of the military services to address the problem of harassment of gays.</p>
        <p>Among its recommendations was the refinement of training for service members of different ranks on how to properly carry out the Clinton administration's policy of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military provided they keep their sexual orientation a secret and do not engage in homosexual acts.</p>
        <p>The investigation at Fort Campbell was requested by Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, who was commander of the 101st Airborne at the time of the murder, and who was reassigned to the Pentagon and made vice director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
        <p>The report concluded that General Clark should be not be held responsible. In fact, it reinforced his own statements made on the day he left his command.</p>
        <p>''There is not, nor has there ever been during my times here, a climate of homophobia on post,'' he had said.</p>
        <p>At Private Glover's trial in December, soldiers testified that Private Winchell had been taunted for months with name-calling, rumor-mongering and an inquiry into his private life that was supposed to be forbidden under military policy.</p>
        <p>The trial also laid bare the flaws in the Clinton administration's policy toward gays in the military. Critics contend that instead of making life easier for gay men and lesbians in the armed services, the policy leaves many to suffer in silence and fear or leave the service.</p>
