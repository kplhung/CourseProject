        <p>In what labor leaders are calling a powerful signal that they intend to support State Comptroller H. Carl McCall for governor in 2002, nearly all of New York's top union officials will hold a fund-raiser for him Thursday in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Officials said it was far too soon for them or their unions to make formal endorsements. But several of them, asking that their names not be used, added that they expected, even intended, Thursday's event to be taken as an early sign of their sympathies. ''We'd elect him tomorrow,'' one prominent union leader said.</p>
        <p>Union officials said that it was highly unusual to hold an event with so many big labor names so far from the election, adding that they could not imagine doing so for the man who might be Mr. McCall's top opponent in a Democratic primary, Andrew M. Cuomo, the federal housing secretary.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall has said he will not make a formal announcement of his plans until after the November elections, but he has made an unusually early start at laying the groundwork for a run for governor and lining up the support of a large number of elected officials, and his aides say he is clearly running.</p>
        <p>He could have a bruising primary against Mr. Cuomo and, should he win, the comptroller could face a daunting challenge in taking on Gov. George E. Pataki, a popular Republican incumbent with an impressive political and fund-raising operation. The governor has said he expects to seek a third term.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Thursday's event marks the beginning of a wholesale shift for the state's labor unions, which have taken pains not to clash with Mr. Pataki. Most remained neutral in the 1998 race, when it was clear throughout that Mr. Pataki would easily win re-election, depriving the Democratic nominee, Peter F. Vallone, of what is usually his party's most potent ally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo's and Mr. Pataki's offices did not return calls today seeking comment. Mr. Cuomo has said he might run for governor, though there has been talk of his taking another high-level Washington job if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency. Mr. Cuomo has said that plenty of time remains for him to decide about 2002 and that he is perplexed by Mr. McCall's early start.</p>
        <p>Asked if the lineup of sponsors for Thursday's event means that he would have strong labor support in a run for governor, Mr. McCall said, ''Somebody could certainly infer that.''</p>
        <p>''I think it would send a signal to anybody that as far as labor is concerned, that I seem to have a good head start in terms of lining up labor support,'' he said. ''That means that support would probably not be there for someone else.''</p>
        <p>Suzy Ballantyne, political director of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, ''It's a little early for us to be making endorsements, but what I think what you can read into it is Carl McCall has a great deal of support in the labor movement for his current plans and future plans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall has long been a favorite of unions for his handling of the state pension funds, including protecting them from attempted raids by lawmakers. His stature within organized labor rose significantly this year after the Legislature passed and Mr. Pataki signed into law a bill giving automatic cost-of-living increases, or COLA's, to retired state and local government workers for the first time, a cause  the comptroller championed for years.</p>
        <p>''The COLA has really solidified what was already very strong labor appreciation for Carl McCall, and I don't think that Andrew has a similar issue that is as transcendent that he can point to,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and one of the sponsors of the fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>The amount organizers expect to raise from Thursday's reception at the carpenters' union hall, something over $100,000, is relatively modest, as is the price of admission, $1,000. An individual can contribute more than $30,000 to a gubernatorial campaign.</p>
        <p>Invitations to the event list 48 co-chairmen, including top officials of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.; District Council 37, the New York City employees' umbrella group; New York State United Teachers; the Transport Workers Union; the Civil Service Employees Association; the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; the Communications Workers of America; and UNITE, the garment workers' union.</p>
        <p>The only notable absence from the list is that of Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the hospital workers' union, who is probably the state's most politically potent labor official. Mr. Rivera is known for hedging his bets politically and has worked hard at building good relations with state Republicans. Last year, he played a central role in negotiating with the governor on a new health care program for the working poor.</p>
