        <p>Svetlana Lunkina and Maria Alexandrova have a fawnlike delicacy that suggests they might break if touched. But as the two young Bolshoi Ballet stars talked, in a backstage conversation on Monday that was filled with laughter and wryly articulated opinions about art and life, it quickly became apparent that underneath that fragility lay strong wills and stronger senses of self.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lunkina, 20, will dance the title role in ''Giselle'' on Saturday and Sundayafternoons at the New York State Theater in a new production by the Bolshoi Theater's director Vladimir Vasiliev, in an engagement presented by Lincoln Center Festival 2000. She is the youngest Bolshoi ballerina ever to tackle the demanding role.</p>
        <p>Ms. Alexandrova, 21, will dance Myrtha, the queen of the ghostly, man-hating Wilis, on Sunday afternoon to Ms. Lunkina's Giselle. And each will perform lead roles in George Balanchine's sumptuous pure-dance ''Symphony in C'' tonight, tomorrow and Friday nights.</p>
        <p>The two are the darlings of ballet critics in Russia and Britain. In a Bolshoi engagement this spring at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Ms. Alexandrova was praised for the regal grandeur of her dancing and for her astonishing jumps. ''I'm not satisfied with it yet,'' she said of her jump, speaking in Russian translated by Marina Panfilovich.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lunkina is new to New York, but she has been much talked about not just for her impressive technique but also for the qualities Mr. Vasiliev sought in his new Giselle. ''After a long gap a young girl has now joined our company who, it seems to me, answers to the role of Giselle,'' he told a Russian interviewer before the production's premiere in 1997, the year Ms. Lunkina graduated from the Moscow Academy of Dance, affiliated with the Bolshoi. ''She is beautiful, light, graceful, sincere, feminine and what is more her technique improves before our very eyes.''</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Lunkina and Ms. Alexandrova began to dance at very young ages in the kinds of local amateur children's folk-dance club in which Rudolf Nureyev got his start, before going on to the academy. At age 9 Ms. Alexandrova, whose father is a state official, saw a television documentary about the school of the Kirov Ballet, Russia's other great international troupe, and knew that she must join the Bolshoi school in Moscow, where she lived. ''My mother was a little afraid,'' she recalled. ''She knew how hard and how complicated the life of a ballerina is. But I said I would do it, and I did.''</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Alexandrova, Ms. Lunkina comes from a family that is not involved in the arts except for her sister, Julia, who has just graduated from the Bolshoi school. Her father prints scholarly texts, and her mother is a former circus gymnast who understood her older daughter's psychological makeup very well, Ms. Lunkina said, laughing. ''I did not dream of being a ballerina,'' she said. She answered a casual yes to her mother's even more casual question, ''Would you like to dance?''</p>
        <p>At 12, she told her mother that she wanted to leave the school. The life of a ballerina was too hard. ''So leave,'' her mother told her, wisely allowing her willful daughter to decide. ''Do as you like.'' Ms. Lunkina laughed. ''My mother knew if she told me to stay, I would never do it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked about their dance heroes during training, both dancers immediately mentioned their earliest teachers at the Bolshoi. Ms. Alexandrova's began her training with Liudmila Kolenchenko.</p>
        <p>''We were all so afraid of her,'' Ms. Alexandrova said. ''And we all adored her. She was very strict, but she loved us all.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Alexandrova knew that her parents adored her, too, she said. ''But here was a person who I understood, who did her best to explain to me what I needed in order to do something in my life. She taught us to have professional discipline. And we were small children then, so everything was emotional for us. The graduates seemed like gods. I think nowadays the attitude of small children is different. But ballet was sacred for us.'' Ms. Alexandrova, who finished her training with Sofia Golovkina, went on to win a gold medal in the 1997 Moscow International Ballet Competition and to create lead roles in Boris Eifman's ''Russian Hamlet'' and a revival of Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lunkina's beloved first teacher was Natalia Savina. ''She must have had a hard job,'' she said. ''I had a very nasty character. But she soothed me. She told me I must and I did.'' Part of the problem was that Ms. Lunkina loved swimming, painting and singing as much as ballet and lost her voice for two years because of overuse.</p>
        <p>Another crucial person in her life was Marina Leonova, her teacher and coach in her last years of training. Ms. Leonova brought Ms. Lunkina to the attention of Bolshoi Ballet personnel, among them Mr. Vasiliev and his wife, Ekaterina Maximova, the former leading Bolshoi ballerina, who coached the awestruck teenager in the role of the betrayed Giselle.</p>
        <p>''For me those rehearsals with her were the most dear and most sacred,'' Ms. Lunkina said. ''I tried to listen to every word and note of her.  ''I was so afraid I wouldn't cope. It was such a responsibility, because I didn't think myself such a genius to dance Giselle at 18. In any case my first Giselle was a Giselle of my emotions exclusively. I gave every corner of myself at that performance and only because of this was it a success. I was living Giselle's life onstage.''</p>
        <p>The two ballerinas said they hoped New York audiences would see the human beings inside their Giselle and Myrtha. And ''Symphony in C,'' which demands such a different kind of dancing? ''They shouldn't see how hard it is,'' Ms. Alexandrova said, laughing.</p>
        <p>''Oh! 'Symphony!' '' Ms. Lunkina said with a sigh. ''I would like the whole company, and especially myself, to show the beauty, strength and emotions of this ballet.''</p>
