        <p>''To our friends up the avenue, who have done things decidedly new, we extend a cordial greeting, a bravo of approval, a sincere salutation and a hearty hand-clasp.''</p>
        <p>The year was 1924. The avenue was Fifth. The welcoming advertisement was placed by Russeks, ''An Institution of Paris Fashion,'' at 36th Street. And the newcomer was Saks-Fifth Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets.</p>
        <p>Russeks is long gone. So are most of the big Fifth Avenue retailers: B. Altman, Arnold Constable, Best &amp; Company, Bonwit Teller and De Pinna. That leaves Saks with the task of restoring the character of its landmark building without freezing the store in time, especially a time that is 76 years past.</p>
        <p>''There aren't many stores that have the wonderful bones this building does architecturally,'' said Christina Johnson, the president and chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue. ''We have the challenge of marrying this company's incredible legacy to the relevancy needs of the consumer.''</p>
        <p>Almost halfway through a five-year, $100 million renovation, from the top floor to the basement (sorry, ''concourse level''), Saks has already picked up an extra 40,000 square feet of selling space by moving the alterations, wrap and pack, receiving and fur storage departments out of the building.</p>
        <p>Now, Saks executives are turning their attention to the main floor. Its good bones have been lost to an accumulation of visual clutter and physical obstructions like sales islands pushed into the aisles.</p>
        <p>''You don't have a clear shot when you're in the store,'' said Stephen B. Joseph, vice president for corporate store planning and design, who is working with the architectural firm Tucci, Segrete &amp; Rosen Consultants. ''Clear sight lines and clear circulation are very important.''</p>
        <p>As part of the renovation of the main floor, scheduled for 2002, sales islands will be pulled back four or five feet to the line of the columns along the main aisles. ''When you walk into Saks Fifth Avenue, you'll see this grand boulevard,'' Ms. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The men's department at the rear of the floor will be moved upstairs, freeing space for cosmetics, jewelry, handbags and accessories. A ring of smaller, almost self-contained selling areas will be created around the perimeter, framed by pilasters with acanthus-leaf capitals that complement the existing columns.</p>
        <p>New chandeliers and sconces will be added, as will some kind of molding, perhaps in trompe l'oeil, to give the ceiling an added sense of depth.</p>
        <p>The men's department will be consolidated on the sixth floor and the seventh floor, which is under renovation. The third floor, home of high-end design, will be renovated next year, with a shallow barrel-vaulted ceiling along the main axis, leading to windows overlooking the Channel Gardens of Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>As unlikely as it seems, the top two floors at this prime location were once occupied by workrooms. These were supervised in the 1930's by Joseph T. Cukor, a cousin of the movie director George Cukor, and were described by Fortune magazine as ''bursting with girls stitching diligently over long tables spread with rippling, exotic fabrics, with wacky designers, grave-faced fitters, blinking tailors and mannequins lolling about waiting for fittings.''</p>
        <p>Saks was designed by Starrett &amp; Van Vleck in Renaissance Revival style. The 10-story limestone and brick building has chamfered corners, two-story-high pilasters and setbacks above the seventh floor. The architects virtually replicated this design at the Garfinckel store in downtown Washington.</p>
        <p>The hyphen in Saks-Fifth Avenue  distinguished it from an older Saks &amp; Company store on Herald Square. The Saks-34th Street building still stands, altered beyond recognition and now known as Herald Center.</p>
        <p>Horace Saks merged his business with Gimbel Brothers in 1923, permitting him to finance construction on Fifth Avenue. More recently, Saks was owned by Batus Inc., a unit of B.A.T. Industries of Britain, and then Investcorp, a Bahrain-based investment bank.</p>
        <p>Saks was acquired two years ago for $2.1 billion by Proffitt's Inc., which changed its name to Saks Inc. The company, based in Birmingham, Ala., operates 357 stores.</p>
        <p>The headquarters of the Saks Fifth Avenue division, which has 61 stores,  occupy 16 floors of the Tower 49 skyscraper at 12 East 49th Street. The store has 650,000 square feet, but  executives will not disclose how much of that is given over to sales.</p>
        <p>Edward M. Calabrese, senior vice president and creative director of Tucci, Segrete &amp; Rosen, contrasted the renovation of Saks with the general transformation of Fifth Avenue into a ''mall-like, homogenized'' environment.</p>
        <p>''So much has been obliterated,'' he said. ''Putting things back and giving a building back its sense of architecture will be very important.</p>
        <p>''I think the bottom line is that they're also looking at the size of the investment. It's one of the last luxury department stores in the United States. It's them and Neiman Marcus. They don't want to make any mistakes.''</p>
