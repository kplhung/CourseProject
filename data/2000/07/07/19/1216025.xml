        <p>The exact downtown location of the new city he is proposing for this country's isolated west must remain vague, William Thomas said, for fear of speculators. To provide a rough idea, though, he mounted a stone wall here and swept his hand in the general direction of a curious cow and the hoof-pocked pastures beyond.</p>
        <p>Other details are more specific, at least on paper. The metropolis that would rise from undesirable farmland in counties Mayo and Roscommon would include an initial population of 100,000, apartment complexes designed for ''maximum tranquillity,'' the finest in hospitals and schools, and even an ice rink designed for international competition. As for its name, Mr. Thomas said he prefers ''The City of the Sacred Heart,'' for the inspiration he receives from his Roman Catholic faith.</p>
        <p>''It may be seen as an option right now, but it will become a necessity,'' said Mr. Thomas of his proposal. He is a defense consultant to the Irish and other governments, who added that he also ''invents things.''</p>
        <p>For all its fantastic elements, Mr. Thomas's idea has spurred national debate, and is being embraced by a bishop and other local leaders. They say that poor roadways and the medieval makeup of towns have largely prevented the western counties from enjoying the economic boom that has Dublin, to the east, bursting in population and prosperity. The region's only recourse, they say, may be to start from scratch.</p>
        <p>The notion of a new city also taps into the west's long-held belief that it is an Irish afterthought, a place whose greatest export seems to be young adults forced to pursue careers elsewhere. Every Friday night, buses return to the struggling town of Ballaghaderreen, jammed with people who have spent the week working in Dublin, more than three hours away.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, Mr. Thomas has impeccable timing. As he promotes his emerald city, a team of government planners is toiling away in the Custom House in Dublin, tinkering with maps of Ireland. Their two-year assignment: to develop a ''national spatial strategy'' to spread the country's resources and opportunities more evenly.</p>
        <p>That quest is part of Ireland's plan for its future, a plan that focuses in large part on how to spend nearly $60 billion in development funds, some of which comes from the European Union. The objectives are to ensure economic stability, promote education and to share the wealth enjoyed in the eastern and southern regions of the country with the west, the midlands, and the counties bordering Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>The greater Dublin area now accounts for about 40 percent of Ireland's population of 3.6 million. International investment and a plethora of high-technology jobs have sent housing prices soaring, clogged its narrow roads and drained other regions of their educated young. Meanwhile, agriculture, which traditionally sustained the west, is waning.</p>
        <p>Finian Matthews, the director of the unit working on the spatial strategy, said those were the reasons the ''the government is eager to create more parity and economic opportunity regardless of where people live.''</p>
        <p>Toward that end, Mr. Matthews and his team are working to identify a few ''gateway communities'' that would become regional hubs through the investment of billions of dollars. In theory, those centers would ease Dublin's troubles and revitalize the country's aged towns and villages. Country roads would become highway links between hubs; a student in remote Connemara would have the same opportunities as one in fashionable Ballsbridge, in Dublin.</p>
        <p>News of the spatial strategy and the loads of money attached to it have stoked territorial pride. Larger towns, like Sligo in County Sligo and Athlone in County West Meath, are presenting themselves as obvious gateways. But Mr. Matthews said no decisions had been made; his team is still studying statistics, consulting experts, and reconfiguring maps that he declined, for obvious reasons, to share.</p>
        <p>And yes, Mr. Matthews has received a copy of Mr. Thomas's proposal, which prominently describes itself as ''real and magnificent, and if successful would change the way the Irish think about themselves, forever.'' The planner recently thumbed through the proposal -- with its drawings of wide boulevards and suggestions for a chapel in every home -- with an expression that was somewhere between a grimace and a grin.</p>
        <p>Early research suggests that the investments would best be spent on existing towns, Mr. Matthews said diplomatically, although he added, ''We're not ruling in or out any option.''</p>
        <p>But the idea has prompted debate and reflection in the west, where there is an average of about 20 people to each square kilometer, compared with 1,147 for each square kilometer in Dublin. Scarred and emptied by the famine 150 years ago, it continues to lose its young people, and with them its stories and its vibrancy. Only Galway, the region's one city, seems on the rise.</p>
        <p>Mary Harkin, chairwoman of a nonprofit organization called the Council for the West, said that ''using urban solutions for rural problems is not the way to go.'' And Sheila Caulfield, a spokeswoman for the Western Development Commission, a public agency that aims to foster growth in the west, said that while the commission emphasized the need to invest in small towns, the concerns of Mr. Thomas were well-founded.</p>
        <p>Thomas Flynn, the bishop for the Roman Catholic diocese of Achonry, which includes the proposed site, enthusiastically supports the plan. Sitting in a spare and hushed office in Ballaghaderreen, Bishop Flynn acknowledged that the idea ''does call for a way of thinking that we haven't been accustomed to.'' But, he added,  ''I think it's salable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas, a short and stout man with an intense gaze, said that he chose the 30-square-mile site after considering factors like the close proximity of Knock International Airport and the discovery of gas fields off the coast of County Mayo. He said he had no idea who owned the land, although he thought the government laid claim to a good chunk of it.</p>
        <p>He also said he had no intention of benefiting financially from his idea. He is content, he said, to continue living in his small farmhouse on the outskirts of Galway, where he writes books on Catholicism and keeps a collection of exotic birds. ''I'm just offering the idea to the nation,'' he said. ''More than that I cannot do.''</p>
        <p>As he toured the site the other day, Mr. Thomas paused at the ruins of Urlar Abbey, a national landmark that sits within the boundaries of his would-be city. Studying its haunting beauty, he vowed to keep it intact.</p>
