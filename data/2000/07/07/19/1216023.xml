        <p>Reporting solid growth in its food and cigarette businesses, Philip Morris said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, matching Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>Net income rose to $2.17 billion, or 95 cents a share, compared with profit from operations of $2.06 billion, or 85 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 5.2 percent, to $20.84 billion from $19.81 billion.</p>

        <p>Reporting solid growth in its food and cigarette businesses, Philip Morris said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 5.5 percent, matching Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>Net income rose to $2.17 billion, or 95 cents a share, compared with profit from operations of $2.06 billion, or 85 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 5.2 percent, to $20.84 billion from $19.81 billion.</p>
        <p>The results were in line with analysts' forecasts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.</p>
        <p>In the quarter a year earlier, the company took a $45 million pretax charge to cover the costs of laying off employees in its domestic tobacco business. That made net income $2.03 billion, or 84 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Sales of cigarettes continued to fall 1 percent to 2 percent for the industry over all, but Philip Morris's sales in the United States increased 3.6 percent, and its market share rose to 51 percent of cigarettes sold at retail outlets from 50.2 percent in the quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The domestic tobacco division's profits increased 6.5 percent, the company said, because of higher prices a pack. Revenue from domestic sales of brands like Marlboro and Merit increased 20.5 percent, to $5.7 billion from $4.7 billion.</p>
        <p>The earnings announcement made no mention of the $145 billion punitive-damages judgment against Philip Morris and other tobacco makers by a Florida jury last week. Analysts expect the judgment to be appealed for years to come and said there would be no material effect on the companies for a long time, if ever.</p>
        <p>''It is a serious issue, but I think it's very manageable,'' said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Another price increase on cigarettes is expected by Labor Day, with analysts predicting 12 to 15 cents a pack.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris said sales increased in its international tobacco and Kraft food divisions, as well. A disappointment was the Miller Brewing Company, where sales dropped by 2.9 percent but profits rose by 8.4 percent because of price increases.</p>
        <p>''Shipments were weaker than expected, but Miller is such a small part of their portfolio,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a tobacco and beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein. ''The profits were in line, even though shipments were weak.''</p>
        <p>On the international tobacco front, Philip Morris said that its revenue fell 1.8 percent compared with that in the period a year earlier but that profits increased by 4.6 percent. About 62 percent of the profits came from sales in Western Europe and Japan, where volume rose as well. Volume slid in markets like Central and Eastern Europe, the company said, and duty-free shipments were lower because of the end of duty-free sales within the European Union.</p>
        <p>The company's Kraft Foods division, which will become much larger when the acquisition of Nabisco Holdings is completed at the end of this year, turned in an impressive performance. Sales grew 3.8 percent and profits rose 5.3 percent, generally better than the industry average. The company credited products like Capri Sun and Tang beverages, as well as Balance Bar, an energy snack bought earlier this year. Lunchables and Kraft cheese also showed higher sales, while Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and Post cereals declined.</p>
        <p>The international food business showed lower sales, but profits rose 5.1 percent, the company said. ''That was the business that did the best relative to expectations,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''If you adjust for currency impact, the profits were up 12 percent. They are starting to see the benefits from integrating their sales force in Europe and showing stronger execution as well as new products.''</p>
        <p>The combining of the Nabisco business with Kraft should go smoothly, Mr. Adelman said, although layoffs are expected.</p>
        <p>The Nabisco brands include Oreo cookies, Ritz crackers and Life Savers candy. Philip Morris agreed last month to buy the company for $14.9 billion, or about $55 a share. It plans to spin off about 20 percent of the combined food company in a public offering next year.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris also said it bought back 36 million shares of its stock at a cost of $900 million. Shares of Philip Morris rose 43.75 cents, to $24.0625.</p>
