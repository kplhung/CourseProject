        <p>For more than three months, Kevin Meeker, owner of Philadelphia Fish and Company, a restaurant and bar, put up with a cook whose obsession with the stock market often took his mind away from the soup.

        <p>Not so long ago, Mr. Meeker says, he would have warned the cook to knock it off and fired him if he did not comply. But not in this job market. Instead, he turned a blind eye to the goofing off, and says he would probably still have the man on the payroll if he had not quit on Mother's Day after being asked to work beyond his eight-hour shift.</p>

        <p>For more than three months, Kevin Meeker, owner of Philadelphia Fish and Company, a restaurant and bar, put up with a cook whose obsession with the stock market often took his mind away from the soup. The 22-year-old employee checked his Motorola shares every half-hour on his pager and periodically slipped out to the dining room to get the bartender to turn on CNBC.</p>
        <p>Not so long ago, Mr. Meeker says, he would have warned the cook to knock it off and fired him if he did not comply. But not in this job market. Instead, he turned a blind eye to the goofing off, and says he would probably still have the man on the payroll if he had not quit on Mother's Day after being asked to work beyond his eight-hour shift.</p>
        <p>''I think the attitude among workers right now is, 'I could always go and get another job,' '' Mr. Meeker said. ''Now, that cook's working for another restaurant around the corner.''</p>
        <p>Checking on stock prices is the least of it. Increasingly, employees are testing the boundaries of the American work ethic as employers, hammered by recruiting and training expenses and fearful that they will be unable to fill job openings, make allowances for just about every form of misconduct. Offenses like frequent tardiness or absenteeism, apathy and even insubordination that would have merited a pink slip a few years ago are now being shrugged off as inconveniences.</p>
        <p>The new management rule of thumb, it seems, is that a warm body is better than no body.</p>
        <p>Take Suzan Windnagel, director of human resources for a credit union in San Jose, Calif. A woman who worked for her was frequently late, gave customers incorrect information and just did not feel like learning new computer skills.</p>
        <p>If not for the tight labor market, Ms. Windnagel says, she would have dismissed the slacker within four months. Instead, she spent a year and a half counseling her, lecturing her and desperately trying to train her. Nothing worked, and, finally, she had to let her go.</p>
        <p>But she says she is neither surprised nor particularly upset about the sloppy work habits she sees around her these days. ''Workers, not bosses, have the upper hand,'' said Ms. Windnagel, who has been a human resources manager for 22 years. ''Managers today know how hard it is to recruit people, so they put up with more. I don't blame workers at all.''</p>
        <p>Most people still put in an honest day's work, of course. It is just that the lazy, the rude and the nonproductive have an an easier time of it.</p>
        <p>Doug Peterson, vice president for human resources at the Shape Corporation, an automotive supplier in Grand Haven, Mich., for example, says most of the company's 1,000 workers are productive and disciplined. Yet Mr. Peterson acknowledges that he harbors under-performers.</p>
        <p>''Have we held on to people where in years past, we would have fired them?'' he said. ''The answer is yes.''</p>
        <p>The reason for the leniency is that at any given time, the company has an average of 40 unfilled jobs.</p>
        <p>Because skilled trades are such tough positions to fill, Mr. Peterson said, he tolerated for nearly a year a hot-tempered staff electrician who often threatened co-workers. The company tried to counsel him and even signed him up for anger-management training, but finally dismissed him. ''Five or six years ago, we would have not put up with that,'' Mr. Peterson said. ''The person would have been gone immediately.''</p>
        <p>To combat worsening tardiness and absenteeism, he said, Shape has chosen the carrot over the stick. Last year, it decided to give workers 17 hours of personal time off a year on top of their vacation days -- and to pay them $10 for each of those hours they do not use. ''We're giving incentives for people to be at work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Adaptec Inc., a maker of software and computer components in Milpitas, Calif., illustrates the starkness of the change taking place in the workplace. Six years ago, almost one-third of the people who left the company had been fired, according to Rick Olivieri, the director of compensation and benefits. Today, that proportion is down to 2 percent. ''It's a real war for people out there right now,'' Mr. Olivieri said.</p>
        <p>But leniency carries risks, warns DeAnne Rosenberg, author of ''Hiring the Best Person for Every Job'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000). Most notably, accommodating shirkers can hurt office morale, she says.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenberg cites the case of a home-health care administrator in Boston who yelled constantly at her co-workers, fobbed off work on colleagues and treated clients disrespectfully. Over eight months, 10 co-workers complained to her supervisor, but he refused to reprimand her, much less fire her. ''He kept saying: 'It's a hard labor market. At least the little she does, she does,' '' Ms. Rosenberg said.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the co-workers took matters into their own hands. They came in on a weekend, packed up the administrator's belongings and moved her desk and chair to another floor, she said. When the administrator came to work on Monday, they pretended she was not there and talked about her as if she had gone to another company.</p>
        <p>She quit that day.</p>
        <p>Obnoxious behavior is one thing. Illegal behavior is another.</p>
        <p>Mark Spring, a labor and employment lawyer in Sacramento, Calif., says that executives at one of his client companies, a national book and music chain, merely gave a written warning to a manager who had ordered two subordinates to move a marijuana plant from his office to his home during work hours, he said.</p>
        <p>In another case, a bank slapped the wrist of an employee who had been caught downloading pornography from the Internet, revoking his Internet privileges for 30 days and sending him to a sensitivity-training course.</p>
        <p>Both the book and music chain and the bank exposed themselves to potential litigation by their inaction, Mr. Spring said.</p>
        <p>Referring to the bank employee, he said, ''If this had happened in the early 90's, he would have been fired because of the recession and because at the time everyone was nervous over sexual harassment.''</p>
        <p>Barring blatant wrongdoing, though, many companies are pursuing the path of least resistance.</p>
        <p>''If a slacker comes in to work at 10 a.m. instead of 8 a.m., maybe the company needs to rethink that worker's schedule,'' said Erisa Ojimba, compensation expert for Salary.com, a salary-resource Web site based in Wellesley, Mass. ''Maybe they're not their most productive before 10 a.m.''</p>
