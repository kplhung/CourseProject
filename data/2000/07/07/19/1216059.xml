        <p>The mystery of the elusive 7-foot-2-inch Frenchman has been solved. With thoughts of his embarrassing Knicks debut last year haunting him, Frederic Weis decided moments before boarding an airplane to New York on Sunday that he is not yet ready to vie for a spot in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>''Frederic was going to the plane but he felt he just wasn't in good enough shape,'' said Frank Catapano, Weis's American agent, who received the news this morning from Didier Rose, Weis's European agent. ''He hadn't played in a couple of weeks and he didn't want to come over not in top shape.''</p>
        <p>A year ago, just weeks after the Knicks made him the 15th pick in the 1999 draft, Weis performed horribly in the Shaw's Pro Summer League, bringing criticism on himself and the Knicks. His strength, toughness and stamina were below par and he eventually returned to France to play.</p>
        <p>Now, after planning for more than three weeks to take a shot at redemption this summer, it appears he has chosen to spare himself the censure by not even attempting to compete. What that means for the near future is unclear, but it seems obvious that Weis will not practice with the Knicks before the coming season and will certainly not play for them in 2000-1.</p>
        <p>General Manager Scott Layden is still hoping to see Weis post up, catch the ball and shoot sometime soon, but the chances of that happening are as slight as Weis's 249-pound frame.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to encourage him to come over and work out with our coaches, but they've said he's not coming,'' said Layden, who has proposed getting Weis over in time to play in Sunday's summer league finale.</p>
        <p>''I doubt it,'' Catapano said. ''They've asked if he'll come over for four days and work out and play one game, but I don't think it's going to happen based on all the stuff that's gone on.''</p>
        <p>Weis, who will represent France in the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will begin working out with the French national team between July 28 and Aug. 1, so the chances of his joining the Knicks for a quick workout after the conclusion of the summer league are tiny. Rather than try to play for the Knicks this season, he will probably sign with a team in Europe, where he could earn as much as $3 million a year. If he does so before Sept. 1, the Knicks will retain his rights and perhaps go through the same charade next summer.</p>
        <p>The absence of Weis cannot accurately be defined as a loss, though so far it has been a waste of a valuable draft pick. The Knicks had no illusions that he would help them this season, and at best they were hoping he could make their roster and get acclimated to N.B.A. roughness during practice. There are even those in the Knicks organization who believe that Weis will never improve enough to make an N.B.A. team.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>A member of the Knicks organization said the club has placed several telephone calls to GRANT HILL since San Antonio's TIM DUNCAN decided last week against joining Hill in Orlando, but none have been returned. . . . With only slim chances of working a sign-and-trade deal for either Portland's BRIAN GRANT or Boston's DANNY FORTSON, the Knicks are beginning to resign themselves to the fact that their core group of players will most likely be the same as last season. All indications are that they will re-sign the free agent KURT THOMAS, who the Knicks feel is a better all-around player than Fortson.</p>
