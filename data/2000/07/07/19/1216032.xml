        <p>The Intel Corporation, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, reported record second-quarter earnings yesterday, largely because of gains on investments. But to Wall Street's relief, the company also reported revenue growth that was stronger than expected, and it narrowly beat expectations for earnings from its products and services.</p>
        <p>''This was not a blowout like some of the other tech stocks have had, but it's not bad,'' said Joseph Osha, who follows the sector for Merrill Lynch Global Securities.</p>
        <p>Intel said it earned $3.14 billion, or 45 cents a diluted share, in the quarter ended June 30, up almost 80 percent from $1.75 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But after adjusting for accounting provisions connected to various acquisitions, as the technology sector is increasingly doing, earnings were 50 cents a share, a penny more than the consensus of analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Revenue jumped 23 percent, to $8.30 billion, from just under $6.75 billion. The figures were especially impressively, analysts said, because the second quarter is normally slow.</p>
        <p>''We saw strong demand in all business groups,'' said Craig R. Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. ''Looking forward, we expect to see strong demand continue into the second half.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call with analysts, Intel officials projected that sales would be ''up'' and then, in case anyone missed the optimism, noted that in the past they had often qualified such projections with adjectives like ''slightly.''</p>
        <p>The results for the quarter and previous periods were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split effective on July 30. The earnings were announced after the close of trading on Nasdaq, in which Intel shares fell $3.3125, to $143. In after-hours trading, the shares rose as high as $147.</p>
        <p>''Intel seems to be on a solid track going forward,'' said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Intel's performance this year has been hampered by its inability to produce as much as customers want to buy. Those constraints are expected to ease in the second half as new capacity comes on line and Intel introduces its Pentium 4 chip, which has been developed under the code name Willamette. But Intel said inventories were still lower than it wanted and declined to assure analysts that supplies would come into balance with demand before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The increased profits in the second quarter included $2.1 billion from Intel's sale of investments in Micron Technology and other companies. Intel has contended that such gains should be included in its regular earnings, since the practice of making strategic investments in smaller companies has become just as routine a feature of Intel's business as making microchips.</p>
        <p>Many other technology companies and a number of banks are also deriving substantial contributions to earnings from their investment activities. Intel said yesterday that its Intel Capital unit held stakes worth $7.5 billion in 450 companies at the end of the quarter.</p>
        <p>Many analysts are concerned, though, that investment earnings can swing widely from quarter to quarter depending on when a company sells investment shares and how the market is performing. In fact, the earnings reported yesterday were close to Wall Street's projections only because analysts scrambled last month to adjust their estimates after the company warned them that the investment gains would be more than triple the $725 million it had previously offered as guidance. Intel projected yesterday that such income would drop back to about $800 million in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>The second-quarter results were negatively affected by a one-time charge of $200 million, or 2 cents a share, for the costs of a program that began in the first quarter to replace defective Pentium III circuit boards.</p>
