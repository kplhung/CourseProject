        <p>JUST weeks ago, it seemed that meat and poultry producers were finally going to have to provide the same nutrition information on fresh cuts of meat that shoppers can find on a can of peas or a box of crackers. President Clinton said so in a radio address on May 27.</p>

        <p>JUST weeks ago, it seemed that meat and poultry producers were finally going to have to provide the same nutrition information on fresh cuts of meat that shoppers can find on a can of peas or a box of crackers. President Clinton said so in a radio address on May 27.</p>
        <p>Well, maybe not.</p>
        <p>Here's what the president said: ''This summer, the federal government will propose that packaged meat and poultry sold in stores must come with nutrition labels. This is just plain common sense. Shoppers value the fact that when they pick up a box of cereal or a frozen meal, they can check the nutrition labels and see how many calories or grams of saturated fat these foods contain. That's the same kind of information that ought to be put on every package of ground beef. Currently fewer than 60 percent of retailers do so, because nutrition labeling of meat is voluntary. It's time we make it mandatory.''</p>
        <p>That seemingly straightforward statement is anything but. It's possible that the nutritional information will appear not on packages but just at the meat counter.</p>
        <p>Nutrition labeling is mandatory for virtually every packaged food, but not for meat and poultry, which are regulated by the Agriculture Department. All other foods are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which since 1994 has required nutrition labeling on packages.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department's regulations are voluntary and allow stores to put nutrition information on placards or in brochures near packages as long as at least 60 percent of the fresh meat is labeled.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has spent time at a supermarket meat counter knows that nutrition labeling is hard to find. Although pork and poultry processors have started including nutrition information, beef processors have not, nor have supermarkets.</p>
        <p>Yet, the Agriculture Department has indicated it does not plan to force meat producers to put information on packages. The Federal Register of April 24 said, ''The agency is proposing to require that nutrition information be provided for these products either on their label or at their point of purchase.''</p>
        <p>The department said last week that it would have no comment on its tentative proposal. But it has obviously signaled what it intends to do.</p>
        <p>Either way, ''we'd like to give the voluntary approach one more try,'' said Sarah Lilygren of the American Meat Institute, a trade association. After all, who wants to face the fact that an eight-ounce porterhouse steak has 740 calories and 50 grams of fat?</p>
        <p>Karen Brown, a senior vice president of the Food Marketing Institute, a supermarket trade association, said that she would have no comment until a final proposal was issued. She noted that some supermarkets, including Wegman's, a 58-store chain in upstate New York, do label meat.</p>
        <p>That was news to Jane Andrews, a Wegman's spokeswoman. She said the company favors labeling but labels only its ground meat because it is difficult to provide accurate nutrition information on meat cut at the stores.</p>
        <p>Though the Agriculture Department is expected to retain a voluntary approach as to where the nutritional information is placed, it will require that ground meats carry the information on the package. In addition, labels will still be able to say things like ''70 percent lean'' or ''80 percent lean.''</p>
        <p>In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department both ruled that a product could use the ''X percent fat-free'' claim only if it was low fat (less than 10 percent) to begin with. ''X percent fat-free'' and ''X percent lean'' are the same.</p>
        <p>That same year, the Agriculture Department proposed a special exemption, allowing the ''percent lean'' claim even when the ground meat was not low fat, as long as  nutrition information was available on the package or at the meat counter.</p>
        <p>There was heated opposition from health professionals, who contended that such labeling confused and misled shoppers. But the Agriculture Department is now proposing to make the loophole permanent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Andrews said a combination of ''X percent lean'' and nutrition information is  exactly what consumers requested in focus groups. ''After we put the nutrition labeling and the 'percent lean' on the ground products, consumers changed what they bought and started reducing fat,'' she continued. Package labeling is preferable, she added, because ''it's easier to read, and it's clear.''</p>
