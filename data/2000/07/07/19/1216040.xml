        <p>MILFORD: COUPLE ORDERED TO MOVE  A white couple charged with bias crimes in connection with the harassment of the black and Hispanic couple next door moved out of their home last weekend in compliance with an order from the Superior Court judge hearing their case. The judge, Karen Nash Sequino, had ordered the couple, Wilfred and Michele Chaisson, both 42, to leave their house by Monday. The Chaissons are charged with intimidation based on bias or bigotry. Mark Hurley, an assistant state's attorney, said the Chaissons had used ''the N-word repeatedly'' with their neighbors and their children.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: H.M.O. TO BOW OUT  More than 40,000 Connecticut customers must look for a new health-maintenance organization because HealthChoice of Connecticut is leaving the insurance business. Doing business as Yale Preferred, HealthChoice covers about 26,000 people through the state's Medicaid program and 14,000 through a commercial H.M.O. HealthChoice will continue commercial H.M.O. operations for about six months.  HealthChoice officials said they would attempt to ensure that no patients were left without coverage.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: STRIKERS PROTEST LAWYERS  More than 40 workers on strike against the Museum of Modern Art demonstrated in front of the museum last night, as Proskauer Rose, the law firm that has represented management during the 11-week walkout, held a reception there. Several Proskauer lawyers said they would not let the strikers stop them from entering the museum. The strike, called by Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers, began April 28.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GAS PRICES UP 37 PERCENT  The price of gasoline in New York and northeastern New Jersey, which had dropped slightly in May, jumped by almost 7 percent in June, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. The increase helped raise gas prices by almost 37 percent in the last 12 months, the agency said yesterday. Electricity prices in the region also rose sharply last month, increasing by almost 10 percent, while the prices of food and clothing fell.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: PAROLE CORRUPTION TRIAL  A campaign worker for Gov. George E. Pataki testified yesterday about being an intermediary between a Pataki fund-raiser and the parents of a felon. The fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, is accused of asking three families to donate money to the governor's 1994 campaign in exchange for favorable parole rulings for their imprisoned sons. The witness, Julie Pyun, said in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that she fielded requests from the parents of a felon about leniency for their son after being introduced to them by Mr. Yoo. A lawyer for Mr. Yoo has denied the charges.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: BABY ABANDONMENT LAW  Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill yesterday allowing a parent to abandon a newborn baby in a safe place without fear of prosecution. The new law is intended to dissuade panicked parents from killing unwanted babies. Several states, including New Jersey, have similar laws. Those states specify places where a baby can be left, like a hospital, but New York's statute is more broadly worded. An unharmed infant no more than 5 days old must be left in ''a suitable location,'' if ''an appropriate person'' is notified of that location, the law says.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HANOVER TO APPEAR OFF BROADWAY  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, has agreed to appear in the Off Broadway show ''The Vagina Monologues'' in the fall, her spokeswoman said yesterday. Ms. Hanover was to have appeared in the play beginning May 30 but dropped out a month before taking the stage, citing family circumstances. The mayor had said days earlier that he had prostate cancer. Ms. Hanover's stint in the show will run from Oct. 16 through Nov. 5.</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: POLICEWOMAN ACCUSED OF THEFT  A Westchester County police officer was charged yesterday with stealing a credit card in July and using it to buy $2,800 worth of jewelry and clothing at a shopping mall. The officer, Iris Emerson, 41, a 15-year veteran, is accused of stealing a credit card from a purse in an apartment building hallway when she was off duty, said Jeanine Pirro, the county district attorney. Ms. Emerson faces up to four years in prison.</p>

        <p>MINEOLA: PRIEST PLEADS GUILTY  A retired priest who had worked in various parishes around Long Island pleaded guilty yesterday to third-degree sodomy involving a 15-year-old boy described as mentally disabled, prosecutors said. The priest, Andrew Millar, 69, was arrested on May 7 at Tobay Beach, east of Jones Beach. Mr. Millar, who retired about a year ago, was accused of  sodomizing the boy in the bathroom of a beach pavilion. Mr. Millar faces up to four years in jail.</p>

        <p>UPPER DEERFIELD: HELP SOUGHT IN BOMB MYSTERY  The state police have appealed to the public for information about an attempted bombing at the Cumberland County offices of Winchester &amp; Western Railroad last week. No one was hurt in the July 10 incident, but one device was disarmed five minutes before it was set to detonate, said Al Della Fave, a police spokesman. Four two-and-a-half-gallon gasoline cans were used in the devices, and investigators said they wanted to know where the square red cans were bought or filled up.</p>
