        <p>Representative Dan Burton urged Justice Department lawyers today to question Vice President Al Gore about a remark that he made on a videotape of a White House coffee in December 1995.</p>
        <p>The videotape is sensitive because it shows both President Clinton and Mr. Gore and contains two apparent references to James T. Riady, an Indonesian businessman who did not attend the coffee but whose large contributions to the Democratic Party are the subject of a federal investigation of campaign finance abuses.</p>
        <p>On the tape of the event, which took place on Dec. 15, 1995, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Mr. Gore addresses Arief Wiriadinata, an Indonesian gardener who illegally contributed $455,000 to the Democratic Party earlier that year, Mr. Burton's investigators said. The vice president apparently mentions Mr. Riady, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is heard telling Mr. Wiriadinata that political issue television advertisements, paid for by large contributors to the Democratic Party, should be shown to Mr. Riady, Mr. Burton's investigators said. Mr. Riady did not contribute any money to the Democrats in either 1995 or 1996.</p>
        <p>On the tape, Mr. Burton said, the vice president is heard saying, ''We ought to, we ought to, we ought to show Mr. Riady the tapes, some of the ad tapes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is not seen on the tape saying those words, but Mr. Burton and committee staff's lawyers have concluded that it is the vice president's voice.</p>
        <p>''Given the vice president's apparent location in the room, and the apparent location of Mr. Wiriadinata, it is a reasonable assumption that Vice President Gore was making this suggestion to Mr. Wiriadinata,'' Mr. Burton wrote today in a five-page letter on the subject to Attorney General Janet Reno. ''It would indeed be extraordinary for the vice president to suggest showing political issue advertisements to an Indonesian billionaire who lives in Jakarta, Indonesia.''</p>
        <p>During the same coffee, Mr. Wiriadinata tells President Clinton, ''James Riady sent me.''</p>
        <p>Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said, ''Wait until Dan Burton finds out that when you play the tape backwards it says, 'Paul is dead.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton, an Indiana Republican, is the chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, which has investigated campaign finance abuses since 1997 and has had the videotape since late that year. It was unclear why the committee is pursuing the issue of Mr. Gore's comment now, but Mr. Burton intends to ask several witnesses about the matter at a hearing scheduled for Thursday.</p>
        <p>Last week the committee's investigators subpoenaed the original of the videotape from the White House and reviewed it on Monday at the F.B.I. laboratory in Quantico, Va., to ensure the accuracy of the words attributed to Mr. Gore. Committee investigators say the vice president's remark raises a question about what he may have known about any relationship between Mr. Wiriadinata and Mr. Riady.</p>
        <p>The committee referred the videotape to the Justice Department last December, but Mr. Gore was not asked about it during his interview with federal investigators last April 19 or in four previous interviews.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton said today that this raised further questions about the aggressiveness of the department's campaign finance inquiry.</p>
        <p>''At a minimum, it is deeply disturbing that the Justice Department has failed to take this piece of potential evidence seriously,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, James C. Wilson, the committee's chief counsel, said: ''It would have been easy for the Justice Department to have followed up on this information last year. I don't understand why the attorney general failed to do so.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiriadinata's contributions to the Democratic Party, totaling $455,000, made headlines in late 1996 after it was reported that he had little income working as a gardener in northern Virginia. His father-in-law was a partner of Mr. Riady at the Lippo Group, the Riady family conglomerate. The Democratic National Committee returned Mr. Wiriadinata's contributions in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiriadinata is believed to be living in Indonesia and has not responded to the Burton committee's efforts to interview him.</p>
        <p>A White House official said that, after listening to the tape, aides to Mr. Gore were not convinced that Mr. Riady's name was used by the vice president. ''People say the V.P. is using a two-syllable name, like Dotty or Godfrey, and not a five-syllable phrase like Mr. Riady,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the official suggested more definitively that Mr. Gore had used the name ''Godfrey'' during the remark. A Houston lawyer, Lee Godfrey, had attended the same coffee.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Gore told investigators that he had seen Mr. Riady only ''twice in my life.'' The first time was during a trip to Malaysia, and the second time was ''when he was in Betty Currie's office preparing to go in to see the president with a couple of other people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton wrote in his letter, ''The vice president does not describe the type of relationship with Mr. Riady that would lead him to suggest a private screening of political advertisements in Jakarta, Indonesia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton suggests seven questions for Ms. Reno's investigators to ask Mr. Gore about the incident. One of them is: ''If the vice president made a suggestion about showing tapes to Mr. Riady, what did he know about Mr. Riady that would lead him to make this suggestion in the presence of Mr. Wiriadinata?''</p>
        <p>''If you are interested,'' Mr. Burton writes in the conclusion of his letter to Ms. Reno, ''the Committee on Government Reform has the original Beta tape, and I would be willing to make arrangements to furnish this evidence to you.''</p>
