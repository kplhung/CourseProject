        <p>As it reaches the end of its two-year project to renovate the Grand Central subway station, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is trying to solve one of the seemingly insurmountable problems of summer in the city: searing-hot subway platforms.</p>
        <p>The M.T.A., as part of a pilot program, has spent $10 million to place 43 air coolers above the platforms at Grand Central and  $1 million for 32 ceiling fans in the Union Square subway station.</p>
        <p>The air coolers were turned on at Grand Central over the last two weeks, and transit officials said they were making at least parts of the platforms cooler. The other parts, however, are still quite hot. Yesterday, as some people stood on the platforms wiping off beads of perspiration, others were quietly inching their way to precisely the right spot underneath one of the coolers.</p>
        <p>The officials said temperatures on the platforms had fallen 5 to 10 degrees, depending on whether the measurement was taken directly underneath the coolers or a few feet away.</p>
        <p>''Right now what we are seeing is right near the unit, you get a good feeling,'' said  Mysore Nagaraja, the chief engineer for New York City Transit, the unit of the M.T.A. that operates subways and buses.  ''But we want to check that through the summer and see how we can make it more effective.''</p>
        <p>Part of the transit authority's problem in the stations stems from its earlier success in air-conditioning subway cars. When a train pulls into a station, heat from the train and its air-conditioning units envelops riders waiting on the platform. When several trains are in a station at the same time, the heat can feel exponentially worse.</p>
        <p>Still, riders interviewed over the last two days said any relief, no matter how small, was welcome.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot better now,'' said Michael Dragone, 33, a sales executive standing underneath a cooler at Grand Central yesterday afternoon. ''Usually, it's miserable. It's like walking into a sauna. I felt the banister on the way down. It's very cool.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he thought his comfort was worth the $10 million price tag, Mr. Dragone paused and then laughed. ''It looks like a lot of money,'' he said, ''but it's not my money.''</p>
        <p>Even one of the transit system's harshest critics was happy for a respite from the heat.</p>
        <p>''This is the first breeze I ever felt in July at Grand Central,'' said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for subway and bus riders. ''If you stand exactly at the right spot, you're cooler. I wasn't alone in people attempting to discover this breeze.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Russianoff also agreed that some relief was better than none.</p>
        <p>''When someone throws you a small lifesaver in the ocean, you don't go, 'Oh, I really want something bigger.' You grab the lifesaver,'' said Mr. Russianoff, standing in the station after the Straphangers  released a report card on the subway system. ''Is it a $10 million lifesaver? I think that's pretty iffy. But it's better.''</p>
        <p>Transit officials call the cooling system in place at Grand Central ''air-tempering,'' not air-conditioning. The units spew cold air from coils cooled by 40-degree water, Mr. Nagaraja said. Though big -- at 15 feet by 7 feet by 3 feet -- and powerful, the black metal units that rumble from the ceilings are still a far cry from air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>''In order to air-condition, you have to completely close off all the vents,'' Mr. Nagaraja said. ''You've got to really make it airtight.''</p>
        <p>Since that is not feasible in stations linked by tunnels and with stairways to the street, the transit authority continues to search for an answer.</p>
        <p>About six weeks ago, in the other half of the pilot program, giant ceiling fans were installed above the platforms at the Union Square subway station. The fans are intended to draft ''fresh air'' from outside the station and blow it onto passengers waiting for a train. Yesterday, the fans seemed to be doing little more than moving the hot air.</p>
        <p>''The theory is that instead of just hot air, to get some fresh air from outside gives you a better feeling than just getting hot air standing on the platform,'' Mr. Nagaraja said.  ''That one has some problems. It's very noisy.'' And it stirs up dust.</p>
        <p>Even so, the fans had their supporters.</p>
        <p>''Anything helps,'' said Aaron Melick, 33, standing underneath a fan. ''I usually immediately break into a sweat as soon as I get down here.''</p>
        <p>Transit officials said they would  evaluate the fans and air cooling units at summer's end with the potential of expanding the program to other subway stations.</p>
