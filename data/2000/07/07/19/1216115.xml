        <p>China's economy grew at an annual rate of 8.2 percent in the first half of the year thanks to a multibillion-dollar government spending program that has halted a six-year slide in the country's economic growth rate. The economy grew 7.1 percent in 1999. But China's economy still has problems: foreign investment fell 7.5 percent from the corresponding period a year ago, meaning the government will have to keep spending its own money to drive growth. Government spending surged 12 percent in the latest six months. The two-year-old spending spree has opened a widening budget deficit.</p>
