        <p>I read the article ''Eating Well: Tea? Turmeric? The Quest for Safer Barbecue'' by Marian Burros (July 5) with great interest, as barbecue has been my life for the last 50 years.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read the article ''Eating Well: Tea? Turmeric? The Quest for Safer Barbecue'' by Marian Burros (July 5) with great interest, as barbecue has been my life for the last 50 years. As a rancher and caterer in San Antonio I have cooked barbecue for groups of thousands, including countless celebrities and even a few presidents.</p>
        <p>Many folks in the North tend to confuse barbecuing with grilling. Also, styles of barbecue vary around the country, but the main thing with Texas barbecue is that the meat (usually brisket) is slow smoked for up to 12 hours in a closed smoker using mesquite or hickory wood chips. The hot coals are in a separate compartment off to one side and not directly under the meat. This indirect slow smoking at about 350 degrees does not char the outside of the meat, thus avoiding a blackened crust. And it leaves the meat nice and juicy inside, medium-cooked, a more appealing way to make grilled meat less hazardous, as your article noted.</p>
        <p>The dry rub, or ''marinade,'' that we put on the meat before cooking contains garlic, which is suspected to be an anticancer agent, according to the article. Also, we drink lots of iced tea with it -- another ''powerful antioxidant,'' in your words.</p>
        <p>Whoa! I always knew we were onto a good thing down here in Texas.</p>
