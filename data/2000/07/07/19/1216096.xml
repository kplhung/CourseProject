        <hl1>A Pro-Choice Chance for Mr. Bush</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Gov George W Bush to stand up to Republican Party's militant right wing and select vice presidential running mate who is pro-choice on abortion issue; sees move strengthening ticket with suburban moderates</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The conventional wisdom that the Republican ticket can never include a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate seems to be eroding. That is a good sign for the party's long-ignored moderate wing and for those who would like to see the Northeast play a stronger role in the G.O.P. The party's expected nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, ought to look closely at this chance to show that he has the spine to stand up to the intimidators from the religious right, a faction that exerted an outsized influence during his father's administration. By selecting a pro-choice running mate, Mr. Bush would also be pulling the party more into alignment with suburban moderates who in numerical terms are more important to the G.O.P. than the anti-abortion movement.</p>
        <p>As Richard Berke reported in The Times, most lists of pro-choice running mates include Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York. The presidential nominee's brother Jeb Bush, who is governor of Florida, said he was dreaming of a ticket with Gen. Colin Powell, who is pro-choice. Such is General Powell's popularity that his selection would silence all but the most militant pro-lifers.</p>

        <p>The conventional wisdom that the Republican ticket can never include a pro-choice vice-presidential candidate seems to be eroding. That is a good sign for the party's long-ignored moderate wing and for those who would like to see the Northeast play a stronger role in the G.O.P. The party's expected nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, ought to look closely at this chance to show that he has the spine to stand up to the intimidators from the religious right, a faction that exerted an outsized influence during his father's administration. By selecting a pro-choice running mate, Mr. Bush would also be pulling the party more into alignment with suburban moderates who in numerical terms are more important to the G.O.P. than the anti-abortion movement.</p>
        <p>As Richard Berke reported in The Times, most lists of pro-choice running mates include Governors Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and George Pataki of New York. The presidential nominee's brother Jeb Bush, who is governor of Florida, said he was dreaming of a ticket with Gen. Colin Powell, who is pro-choice. Such is General Powell's popularity that his selection would silence all but the most militant pro-lifers.</p>
        <p>But former President Gerald Ford suggested that it should not take a dream ticket to embolden his party to stand up to its militant wing. Mr. Ford  singled out Governor Ridge as the kind of ''responsible pro-choice candidate'' who could strengthen the ticket. Mr. Ridge and Governor Pataki have in common the fact that they come from states with big electoral votes. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey has probably been dropped from the list of pro-choice alternatives because of her ill-considered frisking of a black man being held by state police.</p>
        <p>No doubt Mr. Bush will hear warnings that anti-abortion forces could desert the party and even disrupt the convention if he defies them. Bolder advisers might argue that in his recent appearances, including his visit to the N.A.A.C.P. convention, Mr. Bush has attempted to reach beyond normal Republican territory. His political statements on education and Social Security also show Mr. Bush attempting to label himself as a more flexible and independent-minded kind of Republican. A pro-choice running mate would reassure swing voters who worry that Governor Bush is a pleasant man with a secret hard-line agenda. Such voters would surely be impressed if Mr. Bush could get Pat Robertson and others in the Christian right to hold still for a running mate with some pro-choice credentials.</p>
        <p>That would still leave the G.O.P. with a presidential nominee and a platform opposed to abortion. It would also mean, however, that after years of talking about the ''big tent,'' the G.O.P. is ready to respect the views as well as use the votes of Republicans who do not march in lockstep with the religious right and the anti-abortion movement.</p>
