        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that during testimony before the House Government Reform Committee, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, gave assurances regarding his office's contacts with Hollywood studios, directors and writers (news article, July 12).

You say ''General McCaffrey emphasized that the government was using only its power of persuasion, not financial incentives, to influence cinematic themes.''</p>
        <p>In defending the program, General McCaffrey illustrates precisely why the government should not be involved in propaganda efforts of this nature. His office is an arm of the White House and has a vast array of federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies as well as antidrug and forfeiture laws at its disposal. Federal ''power of persuasion'' is akin to a debt collector's holding a hammer over your head while offering financial advice on your debt repayment plans.</p>
