        <p>In the first six weeks after he abruptly entered the Senate race, Representative Rick A. Lazio spent $1.58 million on television advertising, and sought to bolster his candidacy by hiring several political consultants who had worked on Senator John McCain's failed presidential bid, according to campaign records released yesterday.</p>
        <p>The records, which the Lazio campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission and released to reporters, show that Mr. Lazio collected $4.99 million in donations from April 1 through June 30, nearly all of it after becoming a candidate in the wake of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the contest in mid-May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spent a total of $2.32 million, and his campaign now has $6.19 million in the bank, including money left over from his House races.</p>
        <p>The campaign of Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, did not release her records yesterday, saying it would do so later in the week. Earlier this month, the Clinton campaign said it had raised $5.1 million from April 1 through June 30, and spent $5.49 million,  leaving her with $6.4 million on hand.</p>
        <p>Before April 1, Mrs. Clinton had already spent $6.12 million, meaning that so far in this campaign, she has raised $17.9 million and spent $11.61 million. Even with the departure of Mr. Giuliani, who had set a fund-raising record, the campaign is likely to be one of the most expensive in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>In stepping in for Mr. Giuliani, who dropped out to focus on his treatment for prostate cancer, Mr. Lazio did not adopt much of the Giuliani campaign apparatus, the records suggest. The Lazio campaign did spend $4,000 buying computer equipment and mailing lists from the Giuliani campaign, but established its own office in Midtown Manhattan -- Mr. Giuliani's had been downtown -- paying $12,198 for rent and another $15,372 for furniture.</p>
        <p>And instead of keeping the Giuliani staff, Mr. Lazio turned to veterans of the McCain campaign, the records indicate. Mr. Lazio spent several thousand dollars hiring Campaign Services Group, a firm headed by John Weaver, one of Mr. McCain's former strategists, as well as two other McCain consultants, Amy Griffith and Keith Nahigian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also brought on another former McCain strategist, Michael Murphy, and some of Mr. Murphy's associates. A Lazio campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, is another former McCain campaign aide.</p>
        <p>Besides the advertising expenditures, Mr. Lazio focused heavily on direct mail fund-raising solicitations, hoping to emulate Mr. Giuliani's extraordinary success in collecting donations from people around the country who dislike Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio hired a prominent Republican fund-raising company, SCM Associates of New Hampshire, spending $183,412, according to the documents. The campaign also paid $20,156 to Econtributor.com, which handles on-line fund-raising.</p>
        <p>The filings also show that the Lazio campaign returned a $2,000 contribution from Christopher Quick, a former executive of Quick &amp; Reilly, the brokerage company.</p>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Mr. Lazio had inside information before he bought options in Quick &amp; Reilly stock in 1997, which yielded him roughly $13,500, a nearly 600 percent profit, in less than seven weeks.</p>
        <p>Executives at Quick &amp; Reilly, which is now a division of FleetBoston Financial, have been among Mr. Lazio's biggest supporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quick donated $2,000 to the Lazio campaign on June 15, just as he was being questioned by reporters about Mr. Lazio's option's trade. (Mr. Quick said he had not discussed the company's stock with Mr. Lazio.)</p>
        <p>On June 30, the Lazio campaign returned the $2,000 because it was over the limit. Mr. Quick had already donated $2,000, the maximum, on June 28, 1999.</p>
