        <p>ON nearly every dessert menu, sorbets are listed in the very same way, in the very same place: ''assorted sorbets,'' at the bottom, as if they were an afterthought or a compromise for diners who don't want to commit to a whole dessert. It sounds as appealing and nondescript as ''mixed green salad.''</p>
        <p>For many New York restaurants, it is an exercise in deceit. Sorbet, in the hands of a good pastry chef, can be the most thrilling flavor in a meal and can be one of those culinary miracles that actually improve on nature.</p>
        <p>Take the cantaloupe. Its flesh is pureed smooth, its flavor is intensified so that it is more nectar than juice. Then, it is chilled and churned so that it has the creaminess of caramel. It becomes cantaloupe that is as refreshing as an iced drink, as powerful as a shot of whiskey.</p>
        <p>It is what you hope to get from a melon bought at the store and never really find, even at the Greenmarket. The process is simple -- puree, season and freeze -- but it captures the essence of the fruit and the palate of the cook in a way that no other dessert can.</p>
        <p>A good sorbet should taste like an extraction of its main flavor, and nothing else. It should be gutsier than ice cream, and purer; there is no custard to compete with. Its substance is formed by the main flavor, some sweetening and a little water. There are almost no limitations on flavors; they can be summer fruits like peaches, blackberries and nectarines, or spices, chocolate, herbs or spirits. Some chefs have recently taken to making almost-ice-cream sorbets with fromage blanc, sour cream or even goat cheese. All of them are able to stand out without compromise.</p>
        <p>If you were to ask about the ''assorted sorbets'' at Lespinasse, the response would be startling. On a recent day, the choices were: jasmine, red hibiscus, litchi, fromage frais, apricot and orange-nepitella.</p>
        <p>It sounds more like a botanical garden inventory. But it's not that chefs like Chris Broberg at Lespinasse are forcing inventiveness. Sorbets are an ideal way for a flavor to express itself, and they know it.</p>
        <p>Sono serves a cantaloupe sorbet but infuses it with an unusual partner: star anise. Where the melon might droop, the anise picks up. Where the anise might overwhelm, the cantaloupe lightens it. As an ice cream, it would have lacked poignancy.</p>
        <p>A fromage blanc-lemon grass sorbet at Vong strikes a similarly surprising balance. The fromage blanc is tangy and blunt; the lemon grass rounds out the edges and showers it with a floral, herbal aroma that lingers in your mouth. At Eleven Madison Park, a strawberry-moscato sorbet manages to eliminate the tartness of the fruit and the cloyingness of the wine.</p>
        <p>Single flavors can be almost shocking in their purity. A grapefruit sorbet at Brasserie tastes as though you were biting into a very cold, perfectly ripened grapefruit without anything -- not even a grain of sugar -- to distract you.</p>
        <p>But there are plenty of sorbets that taste more like flavored water, or have enough sugar to give you a headache. Others, especially those bought in the grocery store, can be gummy from additives meant to keep them from turning icy.</p>
        <p>While sorbets are easy to make, they are also unforgiving. Underripe strawberries will make a sorbet that tastes green and bitter. Cheap sake will make a sorbet that tastes yeasty and has the aroma of worn socks. Not exactly what most people want.</p>
        <p>Great ingredients are the only way around this. Wines and spirits should be ones you would drink. Spices should be fresh. Fruit should be in good condition and nearly overripe.</p>
        <p>Sugar is added for several reasons. It is a seasoning, like salt in savory dishes. It balances acids, elevates the main flavor and, of course, makes it a dessert. But it is also responsible for creaminess in the texture. Without it, sorbet would be icy and grainy.</p>
        <p>The goal is to sweeten the main flavor without diluting it and without making it, as contradictory as it sounds, sweet. And though regular granulated sugar works, it must be dissolved in water first and cooked into a syrup.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, this additional water can also dilute the flavor, and too much sugar can oversweeten the base. Pastry chefs tend to use a combination of sugar syrup and glucose or Trimoline. These two are invert sugars, sweeteners in which the sucrose has been broken down into glucose and fructose. They have a low moisture content compared with sugar syrup's and are less sweet than granulated sugar. They also inhibit crystallization, making the sorbet feel creamy once it's frozen rather than granular. They can be difficult to find, but light corn syrup, also an invert sugar, makes a good substitute.</p>
        <p>As with any seasoning, you must use your judgment when adding these sweeteners. Tart blueberries, for example, may be watered down by extra sugar syrup. So you may need to use less water in the syrup or more corn syrup.</p>
        <p>In a sorbet that is more of an infusion, like the rosemary-lime sorbet at Local, sweetness is needed to balance the acid in the lime juice and to give texture to the sorbet -- but it isn't meant to upstage the heady scent of the rosemary.</p>
        <p>Sorbets made with starchy or densely textured fruits, like papayas and bananas, do not need as much sugar for texture. At Fressen, a pure papaya sorbet is very creamy but hardly sweetened at all. It tastes as if you were scraping spoonfuls straight from the fruit. For banana sorbet, Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef at Eleven Madison Park, actually roasts the fruit first (whole in its skin with a few slashes so it doesn't explode) to break down its starch.</p>
        <p>There is one other way -- though a less honest way -- to give sorbet a creamy texture. You can add a lightly whipped egg white to the sorbet in the ice cream maker, just before it finishes churning. It makes the sorbet lighter and, some chefs claim, creamier. But I find that it gives the sorbet a texture like that of the head on a beer. It is full, light and annoyingly foamy.</p>
        <p>Once a sorbet base is mixed -- it is usually quite liquid -- it should be tasted and adjusted much like a soup would be. Many fruit sorbets, like jams and jellies, benefit from a splash of citrus juice, which sharpens the flavor. In sorbets made with cream, buttermilk or fromage blanc, you can add a pinch of salt.</p>
        <p>At this point, the sorbet should be a little too intensely flavored, because once it goes into the machine, it will change. The machine whips air into the mixture and diminishes its flavor.</p>
        <p>When making sorbet at home, the biggest problem is usually the ice cream maker. Many home models are rudimentary. They either don't churn the sorbet enough or don't get cold enough, forcing you to call it quits before the mixture is properly churned. Later, you are left with a hard mass that you have to chip like a block of ice.</p>
        <p>One trick is to chill the sorbet liquid before adding it to the machine. This way, it doesn't warm up the freezing container at the beginning. If the sorbet is to contain alcohol, which acts as an antifreeze, you can pour the liquor into a deep pan and light it (carefully!) with a match to burn off the alcohol before adding it to the sorbet.</p>
        <p>Sorbets swirl around the container in the machine unchanged for most of the churning, then turn slushy and thick just at the very end. Checking up on it during the first 20 minutes is discouraging if nothing else.</p>
        <p>It's best to make small batches, so that  you know it will freeze quickly enough for your machine to whip it up well at the end. (It should be thick and almost elastic-looking by the time it's done churning.)</p>
        <p>But there is another reason to make small batches. You don't want the sorbet to last too long. In good restaurants, sorbet is made every day. Some even melt down the batch made in the morning, readjust its flavor and then rechurn it before dinner.</p>
        <p>Sorbet is like any fresh fruit. Its flavor is fleeting. Its texture is fragile. Its moment of intense purity is brief. You should embrace it at its pinnacle, or not at all.</p>
        <p>ROSEMARY-LIME SORBET  Adapted from Local  Time: 20 minutes, plus chilling and churning time</p>
        <p>3/4 cup sugar  3 cups half-and-half  2 tablespoons chopped rosemary</p>
