        <p>THE cookie was round, about as thick as a plate and the color of sand. It was perched on a neat circle of raspberries. Its controlled perfection was just what you expect at Jean Georges. What followed, however, wasn't what you expect from any cookie.</p>
        <p>Anticipating something crisp, I struck it with my fork. It fractured without a problem. But it felt as if I had stabbed at air. It wasn't until I tried to scoop up a piece that things really got weird. Everywhere I touched it, it fell apart. When I finally got it into my mouth, the mere pressure of my teeth dragging it off my fork caused it to  collapse into a million sweet, buttery crumbs. Poof! It was gone.</p>

        <p>THE cookie was round, about as thick as a plate and the color of sand. It was perched on a neat circle of raspberries. Its controlled perfection was just what you expect at Jean Georges. What followed, however, wasn't what you expect from any cookie.</p>
        <p>Anticipating something crisp, I struck it with my fork. It fractured without a problem. But it felt as if I had stabbed at air. It wasn't until I tried to scoop up a piece that things really got weird. Everywhere I touched it, it fell apart. When I finally got it into my mouth, the mere pressure of my teeth dragging it off my fork caused it to  collapse into a million sweet, buttery crumbs. Poof! It was gone.</p>
        <p>After that, I tried to keep each piece intact  long enough to figure out what it was made of. Did it contain meringue? Was it made with low-gluten White Lily flour, rendering it lighter than air? It yielded no clues.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, the chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, gave me the recipe, which he calls petit beurre, or little butter cookie. The cookie is essentially butter held together by cookie crumbs. A standard almond cookie dough is mixed, then shaped into a cookie the size of a Frisbee and baked.</p>
        <p>That's the warm-up.</p>
        <p>Then that large, tasty cookie is smashed to bits. Very fine bits, which are mixed with a lot more butter and whirled in a mixer until they are as light and fluffy as whipped butter. This mixture is spread onto a baking sheet and chilled. Hours later, cookies are cut from this and baked. After they emerge from the oven, filling your house with the aroma of sweet butter, you put them -- still on the baking sheet -- in the refrigerator until they are cold. This last step makes lifting them possible.</p>
        <p>Whoever spent hours figuring out this method was a clever person, but one who probably could have used more fresh air.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vongerichten came across the recipe in ''Nouvelle Cuisine Bourgeoise Pour La Ville et Pour La Campagne,'' a 19th-century cookbook by Urbain Dubois. It does work at home, but you might save it for when you are feeling patient and steady of hand. The rewards are worth every careful step.</p>
        <p>Forget everything you know about cookie baking. Get a scale (you need scientific precision) and a paper-thin flexible spatula, and do not veer from the instructions; this is no time to toss in some chopped chocolate.</p>
        <p>In case a few cookies crumble before they make it to the table, remember the last line in the recipe followed by Mr. Vongerichten's own pastry cooks. ''Put in fridge,'' it reads, ''before attempting to pick it up.''</p>
        <p>PETIT BEURRE COOKIES  Adapted from Jean Georges  Time: 1 1/2 hours, plus about 1 1/2 hours for cooling and chilling</p>
        <p>8 ounces all-purpose flour (see note)  3 ounces almond flour (see note) from 3 ounces packaged slivered almonds  2 3/4 ounces confectioners' sugar  10 ounces softened unsalted butter.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. In a mixer fitted with a paddle, combine the two flours,  confectioners' sugar and 6 1/2 ounces butter.  Mix on medium-low until a dough forms.  Transfer to a baking sheet and roll out  1/8-inch thick. Shape of dough does not matter; smooth edges for even browning. Bake until  barely golden brown at edges, 25 to 35 minutes; be careful not to overbake. Remove from oven and cool completely.</p>
        <p>2. Using your fingers, crumble dough into fine crumbs and place in bowl of mixer fitted with a paddle. Add remaining 3 1/2 ounces butter and mix at medium speed.  Mixture will gather into small pieces, and after a few minutes will change to a dough, pulling away from sides of bowl. Continue to mix until mixture becomes fluffy and creamy like whipped butter; this may take an additional 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Line a baking sheet with plastic wrap.  Using a rubber spatula, transfer dough to sheet and spread in a thick oval. Cover with plastic wrap, and use a rolling pin to roll mixture to about  1/3-inch thick. Chill until firm, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a 3-inch cookie cutter, cut circles from chilled dough. Transfer to baking sheet, spacing cookies at least 2 inches apart. (Scraps of dough may be re-rolled and chilled for additional cookies.) Bake until edges are golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on baking sheet. Transfer baking sheet to refrigerator; allow cookies to become well chilled.</p>
        <p>5. Fifteen minutes before serving, use a thin, flexible spatula to remove cookies from sheet. Chilled cookies may be placed atop a circle of raspberries or other berries. If desired, garnish plate with a scoop of ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 10 to 12 fragile cookies.</p>
        <p>Note: Since precision is necessary, all ingredients should be weighed. Almond flour may be purchased or prepared by pulverizing  blanched almonds in a food processor. Avoid overprocessing the almonds into a paste.</p>
