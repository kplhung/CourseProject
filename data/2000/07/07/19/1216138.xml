        <p>NBC's top entertainment executives offered some frank mea culpas in Pasadena, Calif., yesterday, confessing that they had misjudged the public interest in so-called reality shows and that NBC was now committed to finding a reality show of its own for next summer or sooner.</p>
        <p>One such show the executives talked about extensively, though they said they did not yet have a deal, is called ''Chains of Love,'' which consists of one young woman selecting 4 men she would like to date from a pool of about 100, and then being literally chained to those four men for several weeks, discarding them one at a time until she selects one winner. Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, called it ''a relationship show.''</p>

        <p>NBC's top entertainment executives offered some frank mea culpas in Pasadena, Calif., yesterday, confessing that they had misjudged the public interest in so-called reality shows and that NBC was now committed to finding a reality show of its own for next summer or sooner.</p>
        <p>One such show the executives talked about extensively, though they said they did not yet have a deal, is called ''Chains of Love,'' which consists of one young woman selecting 4 men she would like to date from a pool of about 100, and then being literally chained to those four men for several weeks, discarding them one at a time until she selects one winner. Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, called it ''a relationship show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ancier and Scott Sassa, who runs NBC's entertainment division as president of NBC West Coast, have been under the gun inside the network for missing the reality train last summer and this one with shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC and ''Survivor'' on CBS.</p>
        <p>''Chains of Love'' is another show created in the Netherlands by Endemol, the company that also brought ''Big Brother'' to CBS. In that show 10 people are locked in a house filled with cameras for three months.</p>
        <p>Talking about what content might be appropriate for prime time on American broadcast networks, Mr. Sassa said, ''The line of what is acceptable is moving'' and that reality shows were ''a trend, not a fad.''</p>
        <p>He later emphasized, though, that ''we are not doing any of these shows in lieu of the dramas and comedies you have come to expect from us.''</p>
        <p>NBC attempted to defuse rumors about Mr. Sassa's job's being in jeopardy with some jokes from cast members from two NBC shows, ''Will and Grace'' and ''West Wing,'' who staged a mock news conference dominated by questions abut whether Mr. Sassa would be fired this week, today or any minute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sassa later seriously denied that any of his corporate bosses at NBC had publicly questioned his job performance. Earlier this month network executives did confirm that in a private meeting the chairman of NBC's corporate parent, General Electric, John F. Welch, had lobbed some tough questions at Mr. Sassa about NBC's slow entry into the reality show game. And Bob Wright, the NBC president, had been quoted as saying NBC should have been more aggressive in bidding for some of these reality shows.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Sassa said, ''I don't have to ask Bob questions'' about his job security. ''Bob has been very supportive.''</p>
        <p>If NBC does conclude its deal for ''Chains of Love'' shortly, it is unlikely to get on the air before summer. Mr. Sassa said that the timing of when NBC finally broadcasts some reality show would depend ''on what's available.''</p>
        <p>But he pointed out several times that the current hit reality shows had benefited from beginning in summer months and that NBC had a natural showcase for a summer run of such a show with the finals of the National Basketball Association in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ancier also announced a series of changes in the new fall shows on NBC, as well as one scheduling change. The new comedy ''Tucker'' is moving to Monday night at 8:30 from Tuesday night, switching with the holdover comedy ''Third Rock From the Sun.''</p>
        <p>Tim Meadows of ''Saturday Night Live'' and William Devane are being added to the cast of the new comedy ''The Michael Richards Show,'' Bebe Neuwirth and Tom Conti are being added to the cast of the new drama ''Deadline'' and, Emmy Laybourne, an actress who is the daughter of a well-known television executive, Geraldine Laybourne, now of the Oxygen Channel, is being added to the cast of the new series ''DAG.''</p>
