        <p>Up and Coming</p>
        <p>Is America's youth doing anything good? Of course. And some results will be visible in the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards Exhibition of 2000, at the Corning Incorporated Gallery at Steuben, 667 Madison Avenue, at 61st Street, from next Tuesday through Sept. 24. The exhibition includes some 90 award-winning student works chosen from more than 250,000 submissions in 16 visual arts categories and 10 writing categories. Established in 1923 by M. R. Robinson, the founder of Scholastic, the children's publishing and entertainment company, the awards have previously honored young talents like Truman Capote, Joyce Carol Oates, Sylvia Plath, Robert Redford and Andy Warhol.</p>
        <p>Golden Silents</p>
        <p>In 1915, well before becoming half of the immortal Laurel and Hardy, Oliver Hardy appeared in a one-reel college comedy, ''The Simp and the Sophomores.'' Found in a flea market and recently restored, this historic treasure will be shown in the Northeast Silent Film Festival at the Alamo Theater, in Bucksport, Me., by Northeast Historic Film, an archive in the town. The festival, through Sunday, begins at 8 tomorrow night with ''Old Ironsides'' (1926) and includes ''Behind the Door'' (1919), with Wallace Beery as an evil German submarine captain, and ''The Poor Little Rich Girl'' (1917), starring Mary Pickford as a neglected 11-year-old.</p>
        <p>Highland Fling</p>
        <p>Talented young singers, dancers and musicians from around New Jersey will strut their stuff in ''Brigadoon,'' the Lerner and Loewe musical, when the New Jersey Performing Arts Center's Summer Youth Performance Workshop joins forces with the Westfield Young Artists Cooperative Theater. The show, which opens tomorrow at the center's Victoria Theater, runs through July 30.</p>
        <p>Banquet of Music</p>
        <p>Months ago many a music lover circled the date: Sunday, July 23, the start of the Salzburg Festival 2000 in Austria. The lavish lineup includes new productions of Berlioz's opera ''Troyens,'' Gluck's ''Iphigenie en Tauride,'' Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutti'' and ''Idomeneo,'' Offenbach's ''Belle Helene'' and Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' as well as the world premiere of the Kaija Saariaho opera ''L'amour de Loin,'' directed by Peter Sellars and conducted by Kent Nagano. The festival's two resident orchestras, the Vienna Philharmonic and Camerata Academica Salzburg, will also give a series of concerts. The festival ends on Aug. 31.</p>
