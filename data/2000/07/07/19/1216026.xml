        <p>Editorial calls for further research into whether use of hand-held cell phones is big factor in traffic accidents before United States follows lead of other nations and bans their use by drivers</p>

        <p>There was a lot of debate about the safety implications of car radios when they were developed over 70 years ago. A similar debate is under way now about the use of hand-held cell phones in cars. On the face of it, cell phones are a much bigger potential distraction than radios. They require more concentration by the driver and tie up one hand that ought to be on the steering wheel.</p>
        <p>A few small American municipalities, most recently Marlboro, N.J., have banned the use of hand-held cell phones by drivers. While the matter may require more research, our instinct is that Marlboro and the other communities are on the right track.

        <p>There was a lot of debate about the safety implications of car radios when they were developed over 70 years ago. A similar debate is under way now about the use of hand-held cell phones in cars. On the face of it, cell phones are a much bigger potential distraction than radios. They require more concentration by the driver and tie up one hand that ought to be on the steering wheel.</p>
        <p>A few small American municipalities, most recently Marlboro, N.J., have banned the use of hand-held cell phones by drivers. While the matter may require more research, our instinct is that Marlboro and the other communities are on the right track. We would go so far as to recommend state legislation to guarantee uniformity.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began public hearings yesterday on cell phone use in cars. There are 91 million mobile phone subscribers, and 85 percent of them say they occasionally talk on their phones while driving. The potential for distraction, even disaster, is obvious. A 1997 Canadian study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of an accident increases fourfold if the driver is on a cell phone. But it cautioned that the findings suggest an association, not a causal relationship.</p>
        <p>Few state or local governments tabulate statistics on cell phone use as a factor in traffic accidents. They should start doing so. A statistical analysis persuaded Japanese government officials that cell phones were in fact responsible for traffic violations and accidents and ultimately led to a ban. Congress could usefully underwrite similar studies in this country.</p>
        <p>One technological answer could be hands-free or voice-activated cell phones, which are growing in popularity. But the Canadian study suggested that these phones do not confer a safety advantage over hand-held units.</p>
        <p>So far 13 countries, including Britain, Italy and Australia, have banned cell phone use while driving. That is not reason enough to ban them here. But common sense suggests that the matter deserves, at the very least, serious and comprehensive study, aimed not at delaying action but promoting a sensible response.</p>
