        <p>Editorial urges New York City to comply with State Education Comr Richard P Mills's ban on using uncertified teachers in low-performing schools; holds New York City needs to raise teachers' salaries to compete with surrounding suburbs for certified teachers</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has issued a strongly worded order forbidding New York City to use uncertified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. Some at the Board of Education have responded with skepticism, saying that the current teacher shortage will make it impossible to comply. But the commissioner has set the stage for a confrontation in court, saying that the State Board of Regents will no longer tolerate the city's habit of assigning the most experienced teachers to schools in middle-class neighborhoods while sending neophytes to impoverished schools where students desperately need skilled instruction. The commissioner has a valid point, and the city should promptly comply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills and Schools Chancellor Harold Levy should work out a solution to this difficult though not insoluble problem. But in the long term, teachers' salaries in New York City will need to rise dramatically if the city is to compete with the surrounding suburbs for certified teachers. This week's order from Mr. Mills was meant to remind the state about new laws that require every teacher to be certified by 2003. The timetable requires districts to begin this process earlier with failing schools, where all teachers are to be certified by September of this year.</p>

        <p>New York State's education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has issued a strongly worded order forbidding New York City to use uncertified teachers in low-performing schools beginning this fall. Some at the Board of Education have responded with skepticism, saying that the current teacher shortage will make it impossible to comply. But the commissioner has set the stage for a confrontation in court, saying that the State Board of Regents will no longer tolerate the city's habit of assigning the most experienced teachers to schools in middle-class neighborhoods while sending neophytes to impoverished schools where students desperately need skilled instruction. The commissioner has a valid point, and the city should promptly comply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills and Schools Chancellor Harold Levy should work out a solution to this difficult though not insoluble problem. But in the long term, teachers' salaries in New York City will need to rise dramatically if the city is to compete with the surrounding suburbs for certified teachers. This week's order from Mr. Mills was meant to remind the state about new laws that require every teacher to be certified by 2003. The timetable requires districts to begin this process earlier with failing schools, where all teachers are to be certified by September of this year.</p>
        <p>The low-performing schools referred to in the Mills order involve fewer than 350 uncertified teachers. Mr. Levy could comply with the order by sending his first hires to low-performing schools and dispersing the uncertified teachers in those schools throughout the system. But meeting the 2003 deadline will be harder. About 15 percent of New York City's teachers -- or about 11,000 -- are uncertified. The governor's office and the Legislature have responded to this problem with a flurry of proposals aimed at attracting people to the profession and directing them to where they are most needed -- in low-performing schools. This will be difficult to do as long as salaries in the city remain 25 percent lower than in the surrounding suburbs.</p>
