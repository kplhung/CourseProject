        <p>A federal judge said today that she would issue a verdict sometime next month in the criminal contempt case against Charles G. Bakaly III, the former spokesman for the office of independent counsel who is charged with lying to her about his role as a source for an article in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>As the government and Mr. Bakaly's defense team made their final arguments today, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the chief judge of the Federal District Court here, asked both sides to provide written summations by Aug. 11 that could serve as the foundation for her verdict. She said she would probably deliver the verdict the following week.</p>
        <p>If convicted, Mr. Bakaly could face up to six months in prison for what government lawyers said was a series of lies about how much he contributed to the article, which discussed whether President Clinton could be indicted while in office.</p>
        <p>Alan Gershel, a Justice Department prosecutor, said in his closing argument that Mr. Bakaly misled Judge Johnson and colleagues in his office by trying to conceal some of the information he provided to the reporter who wrote the article, Don Van Natta Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gershel said that a sworn declaration Mr. Bakaly filed with Judge Johnson in February 1999 was false in its assertion that he had never disclosed any ''nonpublic material'' to the reporter.</p>
        <p>''He allowed his falsehoods and lies to be built into his declaration,'' Mr. Gershel said. ''These were lies upon lies, and like a house of cards they eventually came tumbling down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly's defense lawyer, Michele A. Roberts, tried to narrow the focus of the case in her closing argument. She said the prosecutors had raised issues that had nothing to do with the case, like Mr. Bakaly's appearance on the ABC television show ''Good Morning America'' the day after the article was published. Prosecutors had shown a videotape of that show in which Mr. Bakaly denied that the office of independent counsel was the source of the information in the article.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roberts said it was irrelevant to the criminal case if Mr. Bakaly's statements to the interviewer on the show were misleading or accurate. The only thing that mattered, she said, was the signed declaration, which she argued was not deceptive.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roberts said that Mr. Bakaly tried to edit or modify the declaration, which was drafted by lawyers in the independent counsel's office. But she said that while some of his suggested changes were included, several were not.</p>
        <p>''He did not attempt to suggest that he provided no information to Mr. Van Natta,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly is charged not with leaking secret material but with making false and misleading statements to the judge about his role as a source for the article. By doing so, the government has charged, he caused the court and investigators to waste their time, which amounts to an obstruction of justice.</p>
        <p>The Times article, published on Jan. 31, 1999, cited unnamed associates of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, as saying that he had concluded he had the constitutional authority to indict Mr. Clinton while he was in office. It also said that some lawyers in Mr. Starr's office favored indicting Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's lawyers complained to Judge Johnson that the story was leaked by people in Mr. Starr's office to influence the impeachment trial that was under way in the Senate.</p>
        <p>In response to that complaint, Mr. Starr's office filed a brief and a declaration from Mr. Bakaly that asserted he had not provided any ''nonpublic'' information to the reporter.</p>
        <p>After the declaration was filed, Mr. Bakaly gradually disclosed to agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had provided the newspaper with some documents in connection with the article. He also told investigators that he may have inadvertently confirmed some information the reporter had told him he had learned from sources outside the counsel's office.</p>
        <p>When the counsel's office learned of these later disclosures by Mr. Bakaly about his dealings with the reporter, it informed Judge Johnson that the original declaration was inaccurate.</p>
        <p>At the trial, the F.B.I. agents testified that Mr. Bakaly had told them he wanted to send a message via the news article that the investigation by the independent counsel would continue, despite the impeachment proceedings.</p>
        <p>The agents and Mr. Bakaly depicted a situation in which Mr. Bakaly became more forthcoming about his role in contributing to the article and only gradually began to realize that his comments were making him a target of the agents' investigation.</p>
