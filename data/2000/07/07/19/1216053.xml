        <p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON went to New York Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights yesterday morning to talk about health care. The room was packed with hospital workers, including doctors. Some of them had to be Jewish. This is New York City, after all. Yet Mrs. Clinton managed to rein in the darker side of her soul. She got through the morning without once walking up to any of those Jews and unleashing an anti-Semitic rant.</p>
        <p>All right, the joke is pretty weak, but no weaker than the ongoing campaign by some of the first lady's fiercest critics to cast her as a closet Jew-hater, or at least someone with a ''Jewish problem.'' Their latest proof is the accusation that she lit into a campaign worker in Arkansas 26 years ago with a slur that in a comic book might be rendered like this: *!&amp;#@ Jew  cents@&amp;%$!</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, of course, denies having said any such thing. And it is indeed a puzzlement why she would have hurled anti-Semitic invective at a Baptist. Not only a Baptist but a man who also seems confused about how much Jewish blood may run through his veins.</p>
        <p>This man, Paul Fray, has been leaping from branch to branch on his family tree. He told one interviewer that his father was Jewish. He told another that the only Jew in his background was his father's grandmother. Either way, under Jewish law Mr. Fray is about as Jewish as the pope. If the great-grandmother story is true, he would not qualify for automatic Israeli citizenship under that country's Law of Return.</p>
        <p>It was not surprising that mainstream Jewish groups issued statements saying that nothing in Mrs. Clinton's background gives them reason to question her denials.</p>
        <p>Even Assemblyman Dov Hikind, whose political origins were on the Jewish far right, said he did not consider the first lady an anti-Semite. Then he added that he thought she had a credibility problem in the Fray fray. Perhaps that was just Mr. Hikind's way of thanking Mrs. Clinton for the condolence call she paid when his father died three months ago.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what she did or did not say long ago, the dispute presents Mrs. Clinton with an opportunity to reassess her strong support of hate crimes laws. Bear with us for a moment.</p>
        <p>New York State got a version of such legislation last week when Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill that imposes sterner sentences on criminals who go after their victims on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or age. (It will be noted, without comment, that the governor had this to say: ''It is conceivable that if this law had been in effect 100 years ago, the greatest hate crime of all, the Holocaust, could have been avoided.'')</p>
        <p>The logic behind the law is that hate crimes -- beating up gays, desecrating Jewish cemeteries, burning black churches -- affect more than the immediate victim; they can terrorize entire communities.</p>
        <p>But critics see the law as putting the state on a slippery slope. What is being punished most severely is impure thought: bigotry. The actions -- assault, vandalism, arson -- are already serious crimes. Another problem with the legislation for its opponents is that it creates different classes of victims, thus bending the concept of equal protection under the law.</p>
        <p>There is another issue, says Prof. James B. Jacobs, a New York University law professor and a prominent objector to hate crimes bills. This is where the Hillary Clinton fracas comes in.</p>
        <p>LET'S say two men argue over a parking space, hardly implausible in this city. One is Jewish, the other not. They start screaming at each other, and then trade punches. As he takes a swing, the non-Jew angrily shouts: ''*!&amp;#@ Jew  cents@&amp;%$!'' Do those words sound familiar?</p>
        <p>Is this nothing more than guys being dopey? Or is it a hate-motivated assault? It could be interpreted that way under the law. In fact, Professor Jacobs says, there have been comparable situations in other states that led to hate-crimes charges.</p>
        <p>He has trouble with the idea of raising a foolish outburst to the level of a felony. ''In a society like this, those are common frictions that occur,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''People who support hate crimes legislation think they're going to get Tom Metzger,'' Professor Jacobs added, referring to the California white supremacist. ''What they get is Archie Bunker. That person may have prejudices, but he's not necessarily a hard-core racist.''</p>
        <p>Of course neither he nor anyone else really expects Mrs. Clinton to change her mind on this issue. She would probably swear a blue streak before doing that.</p>
