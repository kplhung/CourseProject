      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Janet Huckabee would like it understood that the first family of Arkansas is not moving into a trailer.</p>
        <p>''This is not a trailer,'' she explained today, standing near her husband, Gov. Mike Huckabee, in their backyard.</p>
        <p>''Trailers are pulled behind a pickup truck,'' Mrs. Huckabee said. ''We are not having a trailer on the mansion grounds.'' Nor is it, she explained, a mobile home, since the Huckabees are not going anywhere.</p>
        <p>''Is it a double-wide?'' she continued. ''The answer is no. It's a triple-wide. So get it right, O.K.?''</p>
        <p>Very well -- to be precise, the Huckabees will be living for the next year in what the industry calls ''manufactured housing,'' the kind that is built in a factory and then trucked to a site in two or three pieces. It will be in the backyard at the Governor's Mansion, about to undergo a long overdue renovation.</p>
        <p>This is, of course, a move fraught with risk for any governor, let alone for one whose state already lacks a reputation as the nation's most urbane. When J. D. Harper, the executive director of the state's Manufactured Housing Association, praised the Huckabees today for their ''courage,'' he was not referring to their willingness to attract tornadoes, since the mansion has had no trouble attracting them on its own. (The grounds were heavily damaged by a twister last year.)</p>
        <p>No, Mrs. Huckabee knew exactly what he was talking about.</p>
        <p>''I know -- of all the states in the world, for Arkansas to be the one with a governor living in manufactured housing -- well, you can just hear the jokes already,'' she said in an interview. In fact, the jokes have already begun. Last week, Jay Leno warned that the move would not go over well with Arkansas voters, who might think living in a double-wide would constitute putting on airs.</p>
        <p>But the Huckabees are determined to go through with this, and not just because at least 12 percent of the state's population lives in manufactured housing, according to the 1990 census. The fact is that the temporary home, when it arrives factory-fresh next month, will be larger at 2,131 square feet than the residential space in the mansion, where the Huckabees and their three college-age children have had to live in about 1,200 square feet, about the size of a modest New York apartment.</p>
        <p>The mansion, a brick Georgian built without much foresight in 1950, is small by gubernatorial standards, mostly formal parlors that are heavily visited by tourists who want to see the home once occupied by Bill and Hillary Clinton. (The Clintons tinkered with the design but made no major structural changes.) Large receptions are held in an outdoor tent.</p>
        <p>''You open the door to your bedroom, and there's someone taking a tour,'' said Mr. Huckabee, a Republican who has lived in the house for four years. ''There's no privacy. We have to go in one of the kids' bedrooms to watch TV.'' And, his wife added, the circuit breakers trip if two people use hair dryers.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the temporary home, a high-end Eagle Point model built by Champion Homes, will have a family room, a dining room, a great room, a kitchen, a fireplace and three bedrooms, with easy-to-clean vinyl siding, a washer and dryer, and amenities considered the state of the art in manufactured housing.</p>
        <p>According to the company's brochure, the model is ''designed to appeal to the nation's largest and hottest new home market segment -- the aging baby boomer.'' Mr. Huckabee is 44; his wife just turned 45.</p>
        <p>When the industry heard that the family was planning to move out of the mansion so that it could be expanded and renovated, several manufacturers competed for the honor of donating the home, which is worth about $110,000. After rejecting the security complications of living in an apartment, the Huckabees accepted the offer as a cost-saving measure.</p>
        <p>''I don't know of any other governors who have lived in our products,'' Mr. Harper said. ''There is a certain stigma attached, and we know all the jokes. But in fact this is a way for many people to afford their own homes. So an opportunity like this gives us the forum we need to show what our potential is.''</p>
        <p>The mansion is inside a fenced seven-acre compound in the Quapaw section, a historic district near downtown filled with Queen Annes, Greek revivals and nothing that appeared to have arrived by truck. Zoning rules do not even allow such dwellings. But the neighbors do not seem to mind, as long as no one else tries to bring one in.</p>
        <p>''I'm just glad they're not leaving the neighborhood,'' said Wendy Quaid, who was gardening this morning in front of her 1881 colonial style house, a few doors down from the mansion.</p>
        <p>''Having a governor here kind of helps the stability of the neighborhood,'' Ms. Quaid said. ''Even if he's living in a trailer.''</p>
