        <p>On the stage where 48 feet tapped away in ''42nd Street'' and where Carol Channing descended the stairs in a glittering gown in ''Hello, Dolly!'' friends and associates of David Merrick paid tribute yesterday to the maverick showman who produced those shows and 93 others over a 50-year career. Mr. Merrick died on April 26 at 88.</p>
        <p>The people who filled Broadway's St. James Theater yesterday -- where two seats were left empty to mark the place where Mr. Merrick sat to watch his shows -- included theater veterans like Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, and Jerry Zaks, the stage director. But the audience was mostly made up of members of the public who had come to honor one of the last of a special breed on Broadway: the independent-minded producer who makes his mark. Because production costs have increased so much, most shows these days are produced by corporations or committees of producers.</p>

        <p>On the stage where 48 feet tapped away in ''42nd Street'' and where Carol Channing descended the stairs in a glittering gown in ''Hello, Dolly!'' friends and associates of David Merrick paid tribute yesterday to the maverick showman who produced those shows and 93 others over a 50-year career. Mr. Merrick died on April 26 at 88.</p>
        <p>The people who filled Broadway's St. James Theater yesterday -- where two seats were left empty to mark the place where Mr. Merrick sat to watch his shows -- included theater veterans like Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, and Jerry Zaks, the stage director. But the audience was mostly made up of members of the public who had come to honor one of the last of a special breed on Broadway: the independent-minded producer who makes his mark. Because production costs have increased so much, most shows these days are produced by corporations or committees of producers.</p>
        <p>''He never cared what anyone thought of him,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, who occupies Mr. Merrick's former office above the St. James Theater. ''David Merrick was not a consensus builder at all -- he was a singular, original, idiosyncratic voice. Part of his personality was integral to creating those great works.''</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Merrick's difficult, enigmatic personality that pervaded the memorial yesterday. While several speakers expressed a love of the shows he created, few conveyed a comparable love of the man.</p>
        <p>Mary Rodgers Guettel said Mr. Merrick had much in common with her father, the composer Richard Rodgers, who was admired for his work but often disliked and difficult to know.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Merrick was famous for taking on theater critics with full-page ads contesting their negative reviews, two critics were among those who honored the producer yesterday, Clive Barnes of The New York Post and Howard Kissel of The Daily News. Mr. Kissel wrote a biography of Mr. Merrick, ''David Merrick: The Abominable Showman,'' published in 1993.</p>
        <p>As a testament to the producer's contempt for critics, Mr. Barnes said Mr. Merrick once told him of a wonderful dream he'd had: ''That Walter Kerr died of a heart attack on his way to Brooks Atkinson's funeral.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most unqualified sentiment came from Brian Stokes Mitchell, one of the actors who performed songs from Merrick shows yesterday. Mr. Mitchell, who won a Tony this year for his performance in ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' met his wife, Allyson Tucker, through a Merrick production, ''Oh, Kay!'' ''Wherever you may be -- whether you're here in this theater or you have joined the pantheon of ghosts in theaters around us,'' Mr. Mitchell  said, ''I hope you are surrounded by love.''</p>
