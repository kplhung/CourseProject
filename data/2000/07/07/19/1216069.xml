        <p>Resuming its advertising campaign on behalf of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas after a brief hiatus, the Republican National Committee has begun running a 30-second commercial reiterating Mr. Bush's broad goals for education. For the new spot, California, Nevada and New Hampshire have been added to 17 other states, from the Pacific Northwest to New England, where the Republicans have been buying commercial time.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Alex Castellanos</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush, in an open-necked shirt, speaks directly into the camera. His voice and that of an announcer provide the narrative for a montage of portraits of schoolchildren that includes shots of Mr. Bush mingling with students in classrooms and at school functions.</p>

        <p>Resuming its advertising campaign on behalf of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas after a brief hiatus, the Republican National Committee has begun running a 30-second commercial reiterating Mr. Bush's broad goals for education. For the new spot, California, Nevada and New Hampshire have been added to 17 other states, from the Pacific Northwest to New England, where the Republicans have been buying commercial time.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Alex Castellanos</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Bush, in an open-necked shirt, speaks directly into the camera. His voice and that of an announcer provide the narrative for a montage of portraits of schoolchildren that includes shots of Mr. Bush mingling with students in classrooms and at school functions.</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- Mr. Bush: If we really want to make sure no child gets left behind in America, we need the courage to raise standards in our schools. We need more accountability and more discipline. And we need to stop promoting failing children to the next grade and giving up on them.</p>
        <p>Announcer: George Bush raised standards. Tests scores soared. Texas leads the country in academic improvement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush: It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.</p>
        <p>Announcer: Learn more about the Bush blueprint for accountability, high standards and local control.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Raising educational standards was one of the first issues the governor staked out during the primaries, and he has augmented his advocacy with a series of proposals to increase federal education spending, including a $2.3 billion plan to strengthen math and science education and $2.9 billion to upgrade teacher training. The reference to improvements in standards and pupil performance in Texas is based partly on the results of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test. The campaign says that average scores have improved in each of the last four years and that the percentage of minority students who have passed the test rose to 69 percent in 1999 from 38 percent in 1994. The Gore campaign, however, challenged Mr. Bush's record, contending that Texas's average SAT scores remain among the lowest in the country and that some children's rights groups rank the state near the bottom as a place to raise a family.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This issue advertisement, paid for in part with the soft money donated to the parties in unrestricted amounts, is supposed to refrain from electioneering. But like all of the spots that the Democratic and Republican parties are running this year, it does not try to disguise its intention to convince people to vote for Mr. Bush. Like many of the advertisements produced by the Bush campaign, the party's commercial spotlights the affable candidate, espousing the values he has labeled compassionate conservatism. The script is filled with words like ''courage,'' ''discipline'' and ''standards,'' all meant to convey a highly moral core to a benevolent policy.</p>
