        <p>THE original author of ''Thou Shalt Not Lie'' never anticipated Nobu. Or Pastis. Or Cafe des Artistes.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the lying is about reservations, like ''I made it a month ago'' (often heard at Joe Allen, which accepts them only a week in advance) or ''My secretary set it up this morning'' (often heard at Nobu, which its manager politely terms ''usually impossible'').</p>
        <p>During the last year or so, restaurateurs all over the city say, lying has spiraled out of control. People want what they want when they want it, and, well, if they didn't plan in advance, they're just going to show up and demand it. And they're not only looking for something as modest as a table for two. Parties of 12 are walking in the door unannounced, brandishing a major sense of entitlement.</p>
        <p>''It happens in an economic boom,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in Manhattan. ''When all the really big Hamptons estates are sold, New Yorkers need another place to compete.''</p>
        <p>And it really is a competition, with top restaurants like Babbo and Nobu booking one month in advance, and many more accepting reservations no more than a week ahead. Of course, for some people, it's sport to show up unannounced and see what they can get away with. When they cheat and win, the thrill is complete. Then again, there are others who are simply lazy.</p>
        <p>''I just forgot to call and do it,'' one liar told me.</p>
        <p>She appeared anyway with a friend after the theater one night at Joe Allen, insisting she had called. She was seated.</p>
        <p>''Lying happens several times an evening,'' said Sara Collins, a manager and maitre d'hotel at Nobu. ''We have a very good reservations system, and inherent in the system are controls about who's telling the truth. Oftentimes, a group of eight will stand in front of me and in the thick of it they can't answer the right questions. The ones who are lying always come in ready to fight. They think they can intimidate us, and since I'm a woman they think I'll ultimately buckle and be afraid of them.''</p>
        <p>She sighed. ''They think it's a great thing to brag that they just walked into Nobu and got a table, because the restaurant has become a cult thing, if you will. People know how difficult it is to get in here.''</p>
        <p>You might think that a really smart liar would take a different tack and try to charm the staff, rather than alienate it. (Charming liars who are willing to wait get better treatment than their nasty counterparts, restaurateurs admit.) But the ones who start off nasty, they say, are dead giveaways.</p>
        <p>''If the name is not in the book and the people are not the least bit polite, all signs point to guilty,'' said Mike Cetta, the owner of Sparks Steakhouse. ''Though you've got to play it by ear. The good news is we have 684 seats. If we have a table, we'll seat them.''</p>
        <p>Some liars reveal themselves more quickly than others. Jenifer Lang, the managing director of Cafe des Artistes, who is married to its owner, George Lang, recalled: ''A couple came in once without a reservation and they were very loud, saying, 'Jenifer and George Lang are really close friends of ours.' George and I were standing right there in front of them.'' She laughed. ''It happens a lot.''</p>
        <p>Stephane Gerbier, the general manager at Pastis, has had similar experiences.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate line is, 'I'm a friend of Keith's,' '' he said, referring to the restaurant's owner, Keith McNally. ''Much of our staff has worked with Keith in the past, so they tend to know his friends.'' He sighed. ''But we're trained to be agreeable. It's not a kick for a us to find a liar.''</p>
        <p>Another way some people lie their way through a restaurant's door is to skip playing pals with the owner and go for the big time: using real celebrities.</p>
        <p>''Last week, someone called who said he was coming in with Tom Cruise and they wanted to be served late,'' Ms. Lang said. ''They preordered their dinner and we made special arrangements to stay open. They showed up an hour late and came in without him.''</p>
        <p>Did anyone say anything? ''No, we're in the hospitality business,'' she said philosophically. ''We also had Howard Stern last week. He was a 75-year-old man who came in with his wife.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Della Femina, who owns Della Femina in New York and East Hampton, had an even more unnerving experience. ''I called Alison's by the Beach to make a reservation last week,'' he said, ''and I said who I was and the woman asked, 'Are you really?' It turned out that a few weeks ago someone called and said it was me with a party of eight, and even though the restaurant was really booked, they spent an hour reconfiguring everything. Then in walks a short fat guy with lots of hair.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Della Femina is notoriously bald.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, a stunt like that will work only once, though for some, once is enough.</p>
        <p>''I think people feel restaurants are fair game, and when they're in the Hamptons they're even more fair game,'' Mr. Della Femina said. He recalled an incident that his staff named the Happy Birthday Barbara Scam, which was a reservation for a birthday dinner for 12 on a Saturday night in the middle of the summer. The group requested a custom birthday cake, which the restaurant special-ordered.</p>
        <p>''Three or four days later,'' Mr. Della Femina said, ''the baker called to say that Laundry had put in an order for a cake for 12, East Hampton Point ordered a cake for 12 and Nick &amp; Toni's ordered a cake for 12. These people were going to literally stiff one of us. We stopped our order that day and the people never showed up. Later, we found that they had also tried booking at the Palm that night but had been turned down. I'm not even sure where they wound up. But that's beyond being cynical.''</p>
        <p>Also hovering in the beyond-cynical category, said Tom Piscitello, a maitre d'hotel at Babbo, is the new rash of self-styled concierges. ''That's what they call themselves, but what they do is broker tables for money,'' he said. ''They learn a restaurant's booking system, secure tables and sell them to other people.''</p>
        <p>''We've heard all of the stories people can come up with,'' he went on. ''There are no new ones.'' One of the ways the Babbo staff weeds out storytellers is to assign reservation numbers. But Mr. Piscitello stressed: ''We try to bend over backwards to accommodate people. If someone wants to eat here, they will. They'll just wait.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough, if a liar's got the time and inclination. But at theater district restaurants, for example, the schedule is not as flexible, since the dinner hour begins at around 10 p.m. or later. (Pretheater lying has a very low glamour quotient: after the show is when the actors tend to eat and bring their famous friends with them.)</p>
        <p>Angus McIndoe, a maitre d'hotel at Joe Allen, says he can expect an influx of up to 20 people at one time at 11 on a Saturday night. ''What bothers me most is when people come in then and lie,'' he said. ''They try to intimidate the staff while they hold up everyone else who did things honestly. The people who do it feel it's O.K. to do it. But I can never say, 'Are you lying?' to a customer, and I can't insinuate that because there is always a .01 percent chance that we've made a mistake. So, I tell them, if we have a table, you'll get it. We treat them like a walk-in.''</p>
        <p>Of course, a restaurant like Joe Allen, which is a traditional hangout for people in show business, is not the best place for a liar to stage a scene. As Mr. McIndoe said: ''If it is a Saturday night at 11 o'clock and a celebrity regular comes in, I'm going to seat him first. I'm not going to make Al Pacino wait at the bar for a table.''</p>
        <p>And that's the whole point, isn't it? Because after all the lies have been tried -- the lies on the phone and the lies at the door -- at the end of the day, one thing is clear. He really is Al Pacino. And you're not.</p>
