        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his former opponent in the Senate race yesterday, saying that he believed Hillary Rodham Clinton when she denied making an anti-Semitic slur.</p>
        <p>''I am basically willing to accept her at her word,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And I basically say it is irrelevant what she said or did 26 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's current opponent, Rick A. Lazio, was not nearly so dismissive of the allegations made by a former campaign manager of President Clinton, his wife and a third person in a new book by Jerry Oppenheimer, a former reporter for The National Enquirer. Mr. Lazio used the opportunity to question Mrs. Clinton's credibility, saying he did not know whom to believe about whether she used an anti-Semitic phrase after Mr. Clinton lost his first race for Congress in 1974.</p>
        <p>In coming to Mrs. Clinton's defense, the mayor alluded to his own experience in the last few weeks of being the subject of two largely unflattering biographies. In ''Rudy!'' the investigator reporter Wayne Barrett reveals that the mayor's father served a prison sentence for armed robbery and that some of his relatives were connected to the Mafia and ran a loan-sharking operation.</p>
        <p>''It's in a book,'' he said of the allegation against Mrs. Clinton. ''And it has to do with people who may have some anger at the president and Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>''I should know,'' he added. ''I am familiar with all the false, exaggerated and misused statements in books, and I sympathize with them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also took time yesterday to dampen speculation that he might run for governor in 2002, saying, ''I am not thinking about the governorship.'' Since the mayor dropped out of the Senate race, citing his prostate cancer diagnosis two months ago, he has insisted that he wants to enjoy his remaining 17 months as mayor. He also told reporters yesterday that he had no interest in the job of United States attorney general if George W. Bush were  elected president.</p>
        <p>''I am not a candidate for attorney general either,'' he said. ''I am not in the mind-set of wanting to leave here, and I would like to reserve next year for accomplishing a lot of the things that I want to accomplish as mayor.''</p>
