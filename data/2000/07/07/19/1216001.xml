        <p>FALSE PAPERS  By Andre Aciman  182 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $23.</p>
        <p>Someone once said that nostalgia was the most beautiful word in the language, in any language. Like the cruelest month, it mixes memory and desire, but what is it exactly that we remember, and what do we desire?

        <p>FALSE PAPERS  By Andre Aciman  182 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $23.</p>
        <p>Someone once said that nostalgia was the most beautiful word in the language, in any language. Like the cruelest month, it mixes memory and desire, but what is it exactly that we remember, and what do we desire? In his beguiling new book of essays, ''False Papers,'' Andre Aciman gives these questions deep, lyrical and melancholy reflection, melancholy because nostalgia in this rumination is connected to the quest to make sense out of a life, even though ''we know there is no sense to be made.''</p>
        <p>Readers of Mr. Aciman's earlier work will not be surprised by this rapture over the personal past. In his exquisitely wrought ''Out of Egypt,'' in which he searched his memory for the city of Alexandria, Egypt, where he spent his childhood, his evocation is poignant and affecting because most of what he describes of life there has vanished, along with the Greeks and the Jews who gave Alexandria much of its vitality. This new book is a sort of sequel to the earlier one. It shows the same refined sensibility, this author's remarkable intellectual penetration and his gift for language.</p>
        <p>It is a sequel to ''Out of Egypt'' thematically as well, with Mr. Aciman dryly, wittily, urbanely examining the various meanings of a life lived in permanent exile, thoroughly cut off from the smells and colors of the past.</p>
        <p>In one of the essays in ''False Papers'' Mr. Aciman credits Marcel Proust with ''a vision that gave memory and introspection an aesthetic scope and magnitude no author had conferred on either before.'' The same cannot be said of Mr. Aciman for the simple reason that the Proust of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' came before him. But reading these essays, with their almost languid appreciation for the nuances and subtleties of consciousness, one feels that if Proust had not existed, Mr. Aciman would have invented him.</p>
        <p>He begins with an account of a return trip to Alexandria, which Mr. Aciman's Jewish family was forced to leave in the mid-1960's during the nationalist presidency of Gamal Abdel Nasser. He quickly realizes, as he visits the few vestiges that remain of the vibrant, cosmopolitan city that is no more, that he is not experiencing the powerful emotions that he anticipated his return trip would bring. In a sentence that sums up the themes of this book, he writes: ''This is how I always travel: not so as to experience anything at the time of my tour, but to plot the itinerary of a possible return trip. This, it occurs to me, is also how I live.''</p>
        <p>There is enough rue in that remark for it to leak off the page, but it is rue that contains an entire psychology of emotion. There is a secondhand quality to all experience, including the experience of remembering. We are usually kept from the ecstasy we anticipate by a layer of consciousness that separates us from it. And so in Alexandria Mr. Aciman goes through certain motions -- looking at the old neighborhood, revisiting the beach where he used to spend his summers, cleaning his grandfather's gravestone -- without really feeling much of anything, even as he remains aware that as soon as he returns to New York, he will begin longing for Alexandria again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aciman evokes a similar sort of disconnect as he ruminates on other subjects: the sea glimpsed through trees on the Rome-to-Paris train, the tiny park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he used to go to dream he was in Paris or Rome, an unrequited love of his student days.</p>
        <p>In each instance he draws out the idea that somehow experience itself is less meaningful than the anticipation of it or the memory of it or even the pure imagination of it. Others have had similar thoughts. As Roger Shattuck points out in his recent book, ''Proust's Way,'' the young Marcel of Proust's novel observes his first kiss with his beloved Albertine so closely that it becomes like an object examined in a glass case, more analyzed than felt. In Mr. Aciman's case the disconnect is given its particular character by his identity as an exile.</p>
        <p>''An exile is not just someone who has lost his home; he is someone who can't find another, who can't think of another,'' he writes in a marvelous disquisition on his little park in New York. He remembers having been a young man in Rome dreaming of New York, and now he is in New York longing for Rome and, at the same time, knowing that he will not satisfy his longing by going there.</p>
        <p>''Can I yearn for Rome when I am finally standing where I longed to stand when I was once a young man in Rome?'' he wonders. The question is rhetorical, but it leads Mr. Aciman to disclose the mystery of his little park in New York, which is that it is not a stand-in for Rome or Paris or any place he has visited as an adult. It is Alexandria but not the real Alexandria; it is the Alexandria of imagination ''that is perhaps more in me than it ever was out there.''</p>
        <p>Does that mean that one spends one's life attempting to recapture the sites of one's childhood? It might mean that, but Mr. Aciman is more Proustian than Freudian in these essays. He visits Illiers, the French town where Proust spent his childhood summers and that became Combray in his great novel. Mr. Aciman is struck by how ordinary the Proust house is, and he realizes that Proust's powerful love for Combray and his description of the place as rather grand parallel his own feelings about Alexandria. They explain the mystery of what we long for when we are nostalgic and in that sense nicely limn the delicate meandering of Mr. Aciman's finely tuned mind: ''Illiers itself was simply a place where the young Proust dreamed of a better life to come,'' he writes. ''But, because the dream never came true, he had learned to love instead the place where the dream was born.''</p>
