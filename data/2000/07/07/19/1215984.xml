        <p>UNLIKE most soft drinks, root beer rouses the passions. A cola may offer mild pleasure, ginger ale may tickle the throat, but root beer is something that people seem to love or hate.</p>
        <p>I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I love the flavor of root beer. Too often, though, root beers, like all sodas, taste like industrial products, combining harsh carbonation, chemically induced flavors and an overpowering sweetness.</p>
        <p>But Virgil's is different. This high-end root beer (if the notion is not too absurd) is pure and clean, with a clarity of flavor that leaves you wanting more, rather than wondering what possessed you to drink the whole bottle.</p>
        <p>Originally brewed in England, Virgil's now comes from the Original Beverage Corporation in Los Angeles. It is one of the few sodas these days to use cane sugar, which imports a clean, crisp sweetness, rather than corn syrup, which I find strong and unpleasant, with a metallic aftertaste.</p>
        <p>And unlike so many other root beers, Virgil's has components that are all of the earth, as was true when the term root beer was coined. The ingredients include vanilla, licorice, cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, nutmeg and molasses, and all are clearly discernible in the blend.</p>
        <p>The major sticking point is the price: $2.29 for a 12-ounce bottle, twice the price of most other boutique sodas. I found Virgil's recently at the new Balducci's on the Upper West Side; it is not carried in the Greenwich Village  branch.</p>
