        <p>The United States is famous for its corporate marketing. Think Coke and McDonald's. France is famous for its fine wines. Think Chateau Lafite and Chateau Latour.</p>
        <p>Imagine, then, an American juggernaut like the Robert Mondavi Corporation wandering into a French village like this one that prides itself on its centuries-old vineyards. Mondavi, the big wine company from Napa Valley, Calif., announces its plans to rip down a swath of publicly owned forest to create its own top-of-the-line vines, thereby adding panache to its well-known brand name.</p>
        <p>In an area where distrust of pervasive American culture has been on the boil of late, the intrusion was bound to light a fire among some locals. In fact, it has brought on the most adventuresome management hurdle yet in the career of David Pearson, Mondavi's top executive in France.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson, 38, an oenologist from San Diego who is fluent in French, spent a year in the mid-1980's working with traditional winemakers in France. So, he could be forgiven for thinking his task would be straightforward when he was dispatched from Mondavi's California headquarters in early 1998 with the task of finding a good location, acquiring it and starting a new vineyard.</p>
        <p>The search for the right spot took two years. That, as it turned out, was the easy part.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Pearson announced to local reporters that Mondavi wanted to lease a forested hillside above this village 15 miles northeast of the Mediterranean city of Montpellier and create France's first foreign-owned vin de terroire, the designation for a wine unique to a French region.</p>
        <p>He expected Aniane's 2,120 inhabitants to cheer. After all, Mondavi would be pumping $8 million into the local economy the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Instead, some squawked -- loudly. They protested the destruction of acres of their forest, where they have hunted wild boar for hundreds of years. More than that, they feared that the arrival of a multinational operation would lead to a lowering of standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson, the chief executive of Vichon S.A.R.L., Mondavi's French unit, repeatedly assured the villagers that the company would cherish the region's old growing methods. He noted that Mondavi would be selling the wine it produced there in the United States, not France. He inundated the town with documents and statistics.</p>
        <p>Even so, after three months of negotiations with local officials, he has yet to sign a deal.</p>
        <p>''I've said to myself, this could turn out to be a kind of Elian Gonzalez -- the bigger political issues around the project could complicate a pretty simple matter,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''There are raw nerves out there that our opponents have used.''</p>
        <p>One of the most outspoken of those foes is Aime Guibert, 75, the owner of the Daumas Gassac vineyard that produces one of the finest wines in Languedoc, the region in which Aniane sits. Mr. Guibert is not one to hide his emotions. When the hugely popular farm leader Jose Bove went on trial in June for attacking a half-built McDonald's restaurant north of here, Mr. Guibert showed up to speak at a mass rally in support of Mr. Bove. Unfortunately for Mr. Pearson, Mr. Guibert's property abuts the forests Mondavi wants to buy, and he is in no mood to welcome new neighbors.</p>
        <p>''Mondavi will never have a minute's rest and peace if he destroys the forest,'' Mr. Guibert said, sweeping his arm in the direction of the hills outside his old stone farmhouse. ''Robert Mondavi comes from an industrial wine civilization, not a traditional civilization. I wrote to him and said, 'Robert, don't be mad, don't do something against the village!' ''</p>
        <p>Allied with Mr. Guibert is Marcel Pouget, a metal-factory owner, who runs Aniane's hunting association and has spent his free time tacking posters to the village street poles, reading: ''Non a Mondavi.'' Mr. Pouget, who hunts boar in the hills that Mondavi covets, formed a committee in May to block the company's venture and vowed to take the case to court if necessary.</p>
        <p>''If Mondavi wins, it will be the death of wines in Aniane,'' Mr. Pouget fumed over a morning glass of pastis in his garden in Aniane. ''We have little chateaux here. Within a few years, Mondavi will be buying up land in other parts.''</p>
        <p>Mondavi's critics also fear that the company will use the Aniane vineyard to start a far bigger onslaught on the region's wine industry. ''They are coming in saying they're making a high-class wine,'' said Mark Lintott, a British book editor who lives in Octon, near Aniane. He questions the $8 million Mondavi is prepared to spend. ''The figure sounds like a big industrial winery,'' Mr. Lintott said. ''The figure is hiding something. It's out of all proportion.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lintott is active in a local environmental group that has spoken out against Mondavi and that is also fighting a bid by another American concern, the Panoz Auto Development Company in Hoschton, Ga., to take over a section of protected public land around a lake north of Aniane to build a resort hotel complete with golf course and auto race track.</p>
        <p>France has long resisted economic and cultural incursions by foreigners, particularly Americans. But in the global economy, the quest for national purity is becoming an uphill battle. After all, French interests own several vineyards in Northern California. Taittinger has its own little piece of heaven smack in the middle of Napa Valley.</p>
        <p>For many people here, though, Mondavi's plans seem to threaten a precious tradition: the age-old cultivation of small-scale wines, ''one of the crown jewels of France,'' as Mr. Pearson calls them.</p>
        <p>Mondavi is not about to halt its plans to please the traditionalists of Aniane, however. Having gone public in 1993, it has grown into an international player with more than $370 million in revenue last year. It has vineyards in Italy and Chile and sells its wines in more than 80 countries. In June, with a black-tie dinner in California for hundreds of clients and a charity auction in Manhattan, it celebrated the 20th anniversary of Opus One, its joint California operation with Baron Philippe de Rothschild, who died in 1988.</p>
        <p>Besides, Mondavi is arguably the most skillful global marketer in the business. And what would an adroit global wine company be without a vineyard in France?</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson says the company was driven to start a vineyard in Languedoc in part because the area's winemakers are moving away from mass-produced, low-quality wine to classy labels created on small farms. Unlike the fine old wine areas of Burgundy and Bordeaux, the area seems almost up for grabs. ''The whole issue of developing a region in France is a huge attraction of itself for the Mondavi family,'' he said. ''It's not based on short-term returns. It's a passion for winemaking. It tends to be contagious.''</p>
        <p>When he arrived in France two years ago, Mr. Pearson began discreetly driving around Languedoc, scouting for land. His dream was to start a classic domaine, a farm that would produce a small quantity of top-end wine.</p>
        <p>Since Languedoc winemakers were producing their best wine in many decades, however, no high-quality vineyards were for sale. Then, in May 1999, Mr. Pearson turned off the national highway and drove into the hills outside Aniane. ''I knew immediately this was the spot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He still believes the project will pan out. The town council is planning to vote on the project on July 25. Meanwhile, Mr. Pearson brushes aside the main objection of opponents, that the project will destroy 500 acres of woods, saying the Aniane authorities will ultimately permit the creation of only about 125 acres of vineyards. Mr. Pearson expects to produce about 240,000 bottles of wine by 2010 to sell in American stores for about $60 a bottle.</p>
        <p>He drives his visitor up into the middle of the forest and climbs atop a water tank to soak in the panoramic view. From this perch, he sketches in the air the 10 ''islands'' of vines, each of which will cover about 12 acres. The rest of the land, he insists, will be left undisturbed. ''This place is wild country, that's its magic,'' he declares. ''Why would we want to change it?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearson even hired local ecologists to do an environmental impact study, which concluded that the company's vines might improve the forest's biodiversity.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Pearson says, his detractors are a bothersome minority. Indeed, he has powerful backers, including Andre Ruiz, the mayor of Aniane, who believes Mondavi's presence will bring the village winemakers the kind of international recognition they could sorely use.</p>
        <p>''They know very well it will be easier to sell Aniane wines in the global markets,'' Mr. Ruiz said. Since the forest is public land, he notes, Mondavi will not actually own it but will take a 99-year lease on it.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Pearson can cut a deal with the town fathers, though, his ordeal will not be over. Next, Mondavi will have to gain ''planting rights,'' a process akin to getting one's hands on a New York City taxi medallion. Under European laws that restrict wine production, planting new vines requires buying an equal number of someone else's vines -- perhaps disused ones -- and ripping them out of the ground, freeing up those planting rights.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago, I didn't understand the complexities of what was going on,'' Mr. Pearson said of all the hurdles he had faced. ''Now I understand that this is all very, very complicated.''</p>
