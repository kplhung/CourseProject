        <p>After months of aggressive efforts to place his loyalists on the Reform Party's national committee and as state delegates to its nominating convention, Patrick J. Buchanan is poised to take full control of a party he joined less than a year ago after abandoning his Republican roots.</p>
        <p>His ultimate triumph depends on what happens at a previously unscheduled session of the Reform National Committee, planned for Aug. 8, the day before the party's convention is to open in Long Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>There, if the final pieces fall into place as the Buchanan campaign expects, the party's governing board will ratify a Buchanan ally as head of the convention's credentials committee, providing Mr. Buchanan a huge advantage in resolving disputes over the seating of delegates.</p>
        <p>The confirmation would mark a major turning point in the Reform Party's brief and turbulent history, effectively ending Ross Perot's control, power and influence over a political organization he founded eight years ago as an alternative to the Republican and Democratic parties.</p>
        <p>It would also clear Mr. Buchanan's path to the party's presidential nomination and the $12.5 million in federal campaign funds that goes with it.</p>
        <p>And it would recast the party as a home for Mr. Buchanan's own well-organized, deep-rooted, right-wing political machine to promote socially conservative causes, like opposition to abortion rights, that the Reform Party has previously left out of its platform as too divisive.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the party runs the risk that, under Mr. Buchanan's leadership, it may be marginalized if it fails to collect at least 5 percent of the vote in the general election. By meeting that threshold in each of the past two presidential elections, the party qualified for federal funds the following election cycle.</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. Buchanan say his vision of the Reform Party would, in effect, pick up where the Christian Coalition left off, but his mission could receive substantial lifts in the months ahead. His efforts, for example, would no doubt be aided if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the all-but-named Republican nominee, chose a running mate who favored abortion rights, alienating staunchly conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>For now, the key for Mr. Buchanan is the final naming at the Aug. 8 session of Frank Reed as chairman of the convention's credentials committee, a 15-member panel that decides who are seated as delegates.</p>
        <p>These days, the panel's job is especially critical. Reflecting the polarizing effect Mr. Buchanan has had on the party, the committee has received 40 challenges from 26 states, the resolution of which could affect hundreds of the 596 delegates and 164 members of the national committee, some of whom are also delegates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed, the Ohio state chairman and chairman of the convention rules committee, is considered a Buchanan supporter. But it remains unclear just who is recognized as the credentials chairman because of a dispute between Gerald R. Moan, the party's acting chairman since last winter, and other senior party officials.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks Mr. Moan replaced Russell J. Verney, a close associate of Mr. Perot, as head of the committee with Mr. Reed, over the protests of other party leaders. They favor Dot Drew, an official from North Carolina who had served for years as credentials chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's ascension follows months of contention within the party, largely as a result of his power play. While his efforts to gain control of state delegations have fortified his chances of winning the nomination, they have also offended many party members who cherished Mr. Perot's founding principles that focused on government reform and trade issues and ignored social policy.</p>
        <p>For some time, Mr. Perot did not rule out a third run for the presidency himself. He even tried to have the primary ballot offer voters a third choice, that of ''no endorsement,'' which was widely seen as a signal to his loyalists that nominating no one was better than the choice at hand.</p>
        <p>After the party denied Mr. Perot's request, Mr. Buchanan was left only to defeat John Hagelin, a physicist who has twice run for president under the Natural Law Party banner.</p>
        <p>Some Reform leaders who are skeptical of Mr. Buchanan's motives contend that the real reason for the Aug. 8 meeting, which was called by 50 national committee members loyal to him, is that the Buchanan campaign intends to orchestrate the removal of Mr. Moan and replace him with someone who campaign officials believe would project a stronger and more stable ruling style.</p>
        <p>''Many of us think Gerry has been more than fair to the Buchanan campaign,'' said a top party official who asked not to be named. ''But they don't trust him. He has not been with Pat long enough, so no matter what he does, they're going to dump him.''</p>
        <p>Bay Buchanan, who serves as chief strategist for her brother's campaign, denied that driving Mr. Moan from office was part of the campaign strategy. Mr. Moan, she insisted, proved his value when he removed Mr. Verney as credentials chairman and named Mr. Reed.</p>
        <p>''As long as the convention is run in a manner that is fair to all delegations, I don't see any need for the national committee to interfere with any officer,'' she said. ''And there is no need to remove him.''</p>
        <p>Still, she and Mr. Moan both acknowledged that some national committee members who are ardent Buchanan backers would feel more comfortable with a chairman who has demonstrated unambiguous allegiance to Mr. Buchanan and the direction he would take the party.</p>
        <p>''My perception is they don't have the votes, and the sentiment to remove me is not there,'' Mr. Moan said of any opponents, though he conceded that his days in office might be numbered.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Verney predicted that if Buchanan supporters vote to replace Mr. Moan with a chairman more closely aligned with Mr. Buchanan, the Hagelin camp would file for an injunction in federal court to hold up dispensation of the federal election funds to the Buchanan campaign.</p>
        <p>''Every judge has been appointed by a Republican or Democrat, and the Federal Election Commission is not rushing to send out any money,'' Mr. Verney said. ''That process could take a long time to resolve.''</p>
