        <p>As expected, Tiger Woods attracted the largest gathering at his news conference today. And as expected, Woods was asked if he felt the pressure of entering the British Open as the overwhelming favorite.</p>
        <p>''Whether I'm the favorite or not, I'm going to have the same mind-set, and that's to go out and try to win a championship,'' Woods said. ''I'll give it everything I have.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to have an opportunity to complete the Slam at St. Andrews, but if my career goes as long as I hope it will, I might have a few more opportunities. When it's time to play Thursday, I couldn't care less about the Slam. I need to stay in the present, focus on the shot at hand, and get the job done. If I don't get the job done in the present, there won't be any Slam this year.''</p>
        <p>After winning the United States Open by a record-setting 15 strokes, confidence is not an issue for Woods. But he is trying to contain his excitement before Thursday. If Woods wins, he will become the youngest player in history to complete the Grand Slam. He has already won the Masters (1997), the P.G.A. Championship (1999), and the United States Open last month.</p>
        <p>''I can't really say there's any carry-over from the Open, but I feel pretty good about my game,'' Woods said. ''Am I more confident? I would say I feel pretty good. I don't feel great, nor do you want to feel great. It's only Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Lawrie Injures His Wrist</p>
        <p>Paul Lawrie, the defending British Open champion, injured his wrist this morning while conducting a clinic for children when a youngster's backswing accidentally struck him. After visiting the hospital, Lawrie was advised not to practice today, but he should be ready for Thursday's opening round.</p>
        <p>''It was painful at the time, but I'm not in doubt for Thursday,'' Lawrie said. ''I've just got a bit of swelling that will go down tonight, then I will play tomorrow morning. I've had ice treatment. It's disappointing because I wanted to play today, but I normally only have one practice round, so it's not going to do me any damage.''</p>
        <p>A Legacy to Forget</p>
        <p>Jean Van de Velde held his first British Open news conference since his debacle last year at Carnoustie, Scotland, when he reached the 72nd hole holding a three-stroke lead, but made a triple-bogey and lost to Paul Lawrie in a playoff. As usual, Van de Velde handled questions about last year with humor.</p>
        <p>Asked his reaction when he saw last year's British Open replayed on television recently, Van de Velde said: ''It wasn't much of a reaction. I was there, if you remember. I did it, so I remember.</p>
        <p>''People ask me if I've dreamt about it. I have some better things to dream about. That will be my nightmares, not my dreams.''</p>
        <p>Getting Back to Basics</p>
        <p>David Duval had done some soul searching the past few weeks, contemplating the fact that he is ranked No. 2 in the world but without a victory since April last year.</p>
        <p>''I've gotten away from how I play, started doing some things that I just don't do,'' said Duval, in quest of his first major championship. ''It has made me frustrated. I used to make one bogey a day, maybe. Now, I'm making bogeys every day, so I have to counterbalance that with six or seven birdies, and that's hard to do.</p>
        <p>''I need to get back to hitting greens. If you give me 18 putts from 15 to 20 feet every round of golf, I am going to win golf tournaments, two to six per year. I need to get back to doing the things I'm good at.'' Duval admitted that at the moment, there is no rivalry between himself and Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>''I've been a lot more concerned with getting myself going,'' Duval said. ''It goes without saying that he has been spectacular.''</p>
