        <p>Gone are the far-reaching wings of Kerry Kittles. The Nets are grounded at the shooting guard position this season now that Kittles, their starter, will be recovering from knee surgery.</p>
        <p>''Kerry is a player who makes shots, who particularly at guard is long, so he presents defensive problems for players,'' Nets President Rod Thorn said. ''If you don't have a player with those kinds of skills, it hurts. Coming in, I knew there was the possibility he wouldn't be playing, but now it's a reality. Now we have to find someone to take his spot.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks from the beginning of the free-agent signing period, Thorn said the team has identified its options to replace Kittles, concentrating either on Ron Mercer, the Orlando free-agent guard, or on re-signing Kendall Gill, who would move from small forward to his natural position of shooting guard.</p>
        <p>How the Nets proceed depends on whether they receive one or two injury exceptions back from the league, exceptions worth approximately $3.8 million each. The Nets have applied for two injury exceptions -- for center Jayson Williams, who retired because of his broken leg, and for Kittles -- but realistically they hope to receive only one, within two weeks.</p>
        <p>Still, the extra money is an advantage the Nets have over other teams interested in Mercer that are also over the salary cap. Both Miami and Boston are interested in Mercer. But those teams can offer Mercer only the midlevel exception of $2.25 million, unless they work out a sign-and-trade deal with Orlando, where Mercer started his final 31 games last season.</p>
        <p>Chicago, another interested team, is under the cap and, if inclined, could offer Mercer as much as $67.6 million over six years, the maximum amount allowable.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure Ron's looking for as much as he can get,'' Thorn said. ''But the marketplace will let you know. If I'm him, I'm going to look where I can play, where I can fit in.''</p>
        <p>He said he would try to sell Mercer on that starting spot next week. ''We're trying to get him to come in,'' Thorn said, but added that the Nets do not intend to haul out the marching bands, cheerleaders and other razzle-dazzle tactics other teams have used this summer to recruit free agents.</p>
        <p>Mercer made the National Basketball Association's all-rookie team in 1997 with the Celtics, who drafted him No. 6 over all. While he has averaged 16.2 points in his three seasons, the 6-foot-7-inch guard has also been traded by two teams who did not think they would be willing to satisfy his salary demands when he became a free agent.</p>
        <p>Boston Coach Rick Pitino, who recruited Mercer at Kentucky and traded him last season, is still very close to Mercer and said he plans to visit Mercer on Thursday at his home in Nashville to discuss the player's future, and not necessarily in Boston.</p>
        <p>''Ron has a lot of loyalty to me and to Boston,'' Pitino said. ''But right now I'd have to say Chicago and Miami are the front-runners.''</p>
        <p>The Nets could offer Mercer the $3.8 million exception this year but would also be able to increase it by 10 percent each year, up to six years. Most likely, the Nets will not be the first to have the ink dry on Aug. 1, when free-agent signings can begin, because they will wait to see what value the market places on the available free agents.</p>
        <p>''If we don't sign anybody by Aug. 1, don't worry about it,'' Thorn said. ''We're going to be signing somebody.''</p>
        <p>While the 3-point specialist Hubert Davis, a free agent from Dallas, is also a consideration, re-signing Gill is an attractive option for the Nets unless he demands much more than his $5.6 million salary. The team is happy with Lucious Harris as the backup shooting guard but wants to solidify the starting spot. ''I think that's where Kendall would rather play,'' Thorn said. ''He's been one of the better defenders in the league, but his shooting is what's kept Kendall from being a star in the league.''</p>
        <p>Thorn added: ''If we get the injury exception or a midlevel exception for a player of Mercer's skills, do you need both of those guys? Probably not.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets lost their Shaw Summer League game to the Washington Wizards, 78-73, in front of Nets officials, including the owner, LEWIS KATZ, and HARVEY SCHILLER of YankeeNets. TREMAINE FOWLKES scored 14 points and KEVIN FREEMAN added 11 for the Nets.</p>
