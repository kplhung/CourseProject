        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Having read Amanda Hesser's ''The Menu Winks, and Catches the Eye'' (June 28), I must assure her that there are excellent reasons why chefs list ingredients on menus.</p>
        <p>Like a number of others, I have severe allergies: anaphylaxis from reactions to certain common food items. Let me skip the unpalatable details and simply assure you that we have a startling tendency to wind up hospitalized or dead when people serve us the foods we can't eat.</p>
        <p>As a result, we tend to carry around little notes spelling out what can't be consumed, then we hope that the chef and serving staff have the knowledge to take us seriously. Usually they do, which is very fortunate. Those who don't are inclined to think that people are fishing for their ingredients to copy the dishes. Such fearful establishments tend to have dishes not worth attempting to copy.</p>
        <p>Allow me to extend thanks to those chefs who have taken the practical approach of listing ingredients. They not only keep themselves out of legal hot water, but they ease the burden on their serving staff while saving customers' lives. Pretty neat trick with just a few words.</p>
