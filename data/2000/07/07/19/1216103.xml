        <p>It has been a long, long time since water cascading from the Sierra Nevada here flowed through its riverbed in anything like the way that nature intended.</p>
        <p>Here, as across California, the route is determined by a network of elaborate plumbing: an extraordinary system of tunnels, canals, pipes, dams and reservoirs, all built decades ago by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in order to transform billions of gallons of water into staggering amounts of electricity.</p>
        <p>Now, in one of the most ambitious plans ever under electrical deregulation, every piece of the  utility's system of 174 dams, 99 reservoirs, 68 power plants, 380 miles of artificial waterways and hundreds of thousands of acres of land could be auctioned by sometime next year.</p>
        <p>The transfer would be the biggest of its kind, and, while details are still being worked out by state regulators, the plan has raised concerns about how the need for providing electrical power would be balanced against the need to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>California is one of a handful of states that has taken the lead in deregulating utilities, as state lawmakers have moved to separate the generation of power from its distribution. But California, with its wealth of hydropower, must confront another issue: how to keep a hand in the fate of one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world after it has been broken into pieces.</p>
        <p>''I think the worst thing that could happen would be the kind of fragmentation that could result if these assets were sold off to new owners,'' said Doug Wheeler, who was, until last year, California's secretary of natural resources, and whose comments reflected a sense of apprehension about the potential environmental consequences of the planned transfer.</p>
        <p>Until now, as in much of the United States, California's electric utilities have fallen under the scrutiny of a state watchdog whose muscle to press for good conduct is backed up a carrot: the authority to impose or withhold rate increases.</p>
        <p>But under the deregulation plan, motivated by a desire to drive down electricity rates, and approved by the California Legislature in a unanimous vote, all power generated in the state is supposed to be opened to competition by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>That will relegate existing utilities to the role of mere providers, while allowing the new owners of power generation to set prices freely, without the oversight that has for long been built into the system.</p>
        <p>Pacific Gas and the state's other utilities have already sold most of their conventional generating plants, to companies like Duke Power and the Enron Corporation. But what is being debated now is whether, when it comes to hydropower, the free market is really the right recipe.</p>
        <p>''Californians have been given a chance to decide how this system will be managed and, in turn, how our rivers will be cared for,'' said Thomas J. Graff, the Western regional director of Environmental Defense, a private advocacy group, and a leader in campaign by environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts to subject any transfer to strict environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>Across the country, about 40 percent of the nation's 96,000 megawatts of hydropower capacity is in private hands. Most of that still falls under state regulation, but as other hydropower-rich states like Oregon have begun to follow California toward the free market, corporate executives and government officials have been watching to see which way California turns at what could be a critical juncture.</p>
        <p>[Indeed, a plan submitted on Tuesday by two United States senators would seek to accelerate the deregulation process. A bill by the senators, Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, would require all states to deregulate their electric power monopolies by 2002.]</p>
        <p>By federal law, the conditions under which dams operate are supposed to be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whose 30-year licenses spell out such details as how much of a river's water must remain in its natural bed.</p>
        <p>In practice, though, the federal relicensing process has been slow and so often delayed that it has kindled considerable mistrust.</p>
        <p>To fly over the remote, rugged canyons of the Sierra of Northern and Central California is to see the extent to which the appetite for the power delivered by Pacific Gas and Electric has transformed the waterways.</p>
        <p>From Bakersfield in the south to near the Oregon border, the hydropower system stretches for more than 300 miles. All along the way, beneath soaring peaks and snowy meadows, streams and rivers can be seen empty or diminished across long sections in which their flow has been diverted into canals, tunnels and turbines.</p>
        <p>Among those blocked or drained, some since the early part of the 20th century, are portions of the Feather, Yuba, American, Kern, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Eel, as well as the Mokelumne, where in the summer -- as is typical -- as many as 19 gallons in 20 is channeled away from the riverbed.</p>
        <p>What is at stake, according to a 1996 report by a team of scientists convened by the United States Forest Service, are rivers and streamside areas ''the most altered and impaired habitats of the Sierra.'' The report said that dams were principally at fault.</p>
        <p>Among the major casualties have been populations of migratory fish like the salmon and steelhead, prevented by dams from returning to their river spawning grounds, and resident varieties like the trout, no longer able to thrive in rivers like the Mokelumne and the Feather, because of dams and inadequate water flow.</p>
        <p>Instead of the river's natural course, the waters travel along what amount to giant staircases, channeled almost horizontally under mountains, through Ponderosa pine forests and along steep granite cliffs before being sent plunging downward in a rush, in order to turn the turbines that generate power.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the Pacific Gas system generates some 3,800 megawatts of power per hour, or enough to light four million homes, and estimates of its value have soared as high as $5 billion.</p>
        <p>In maneuvering leading up to the potential transfer, the utility's parent corporation, the P. G. &amp; E. Corporation, has said that it would be willing to spend as much as $175 million to improve the hydropower system's environmental performance, in large part by reducing power generation and increasing the flow of water through stream beds.</p>
        <p>But that offer was contingent on a deal that would allow the P. G. &amp; E. Corporation to buy the assets itself, bypassing the kind of public bidding seen as most likely to bring ratepayers the highest return. So far, P. G. &amp; E. has been unable to win approval for such a guarantee, and it has said that unless it can do so, it sees no alternative but to proceed with the auction, which it says might leave the state, with limited legal powers, unable to force any kind of environmental repair.</p>
        <p>No conditions have been set as to who might be deemed an acceptable bidder. But if there were a sell-off of dams, the transfer would have to be approved by federal regulators, whose main task would be to determine if the new buyer possessed the resources necessary to operate the acquisition.</p>
        <p>Any decision on how to proceed with a sale is now in the hands of the state's Public Utilities Commission, which has spent the last several months conducting hearings. The commission has ordered a report, due in September, to examine the potential environmental impact of any hand-over.</p>
        <p>In the Legislature, one leading Democrat, Fred Keeley, has introduced a bill that would postpone the process, by authorizing the state to purchase the utility's land and other assets and retain them for up to six years while deciding whether to transfer individual parcels to public agencies or to sell them to private bidders.</p>
        <p>As one potential model for the kind of agreement that might be built into any sale, some advocates point to an accord struck last summer between the P. G. &amp; E. Corporation and state and federal agencies to share the $50 million cost of removing five small hydropower dams on Battle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.</p>
        <p>Those dams had been widely recognized as an impediment to salmon and steelhead populations, and the announcement of the deal was made jointly by the utility, Gov. Gray Davis of California, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt.</p>
        <p>Even if no other dams are to be razed, groups like Environmental Defense have said that any transfer of ownership should be prefaced at least by a deal that would restore water flows by a factor of 10 or 20 in rivers like the Mokelumne, in order to help restore fish habitats.</p>
        <p>A report issued by the organization in California this week estimated that such a move would result in only a 10 percent to 20 percent decrease in hydropower generation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Graff, the regional director, said the price tag for an acceptable package of environmental repair would be about $400 million.</p>
        <p>At their San Francisco headquarters, P. G. &amp; E. Corporation officials said they were preparing a proposal that they said would balance the need for power generation and environmental protection on condition, again, that the dams and other assets remain in the hands of the company.</p>
        <p>They also warned that it would be foolhardy to move too drastically to reign in hydropower, particularly now, at a time when surging demand has been testing California's capacity to generate electricity, and when alternative means of power generation carry environmental consequences of their own.</p>
        <p>''It all comes down to the fact that the state needs electric power, and this is a clean way to provide it,'' said Jon Tremayne, a Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman.</p>
