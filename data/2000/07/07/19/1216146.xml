        <p>In an effort to finalize a Middle East peace accord, President Clinton has delayed his trip to Japan by one day and will stay at Camp David with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, the White House announced just after midnight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton now plans to leave for a summit meeting in Japan of the seven leading industrial nations on Thursday morning, giving him at least another 24 hours to urge the two leaders to come to an agreement.</p>
        <p>The chief White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president believed that delaying his departure was in the best interests of the peace effort.</p>
        <p>The negotiations, described as increasingly intense and heated, were still going after midnight, the third straight night of very late talks.</p>
        <p>''They're still at it,'' another White House spokesman, P. J. Crowley,  said at 12:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>The decision to stay at Camp David appeared to reflect the up and down twists of the talks. On Tuesday, it seemed that the impossible might be possible: an agreement on all the issues, including Jerusalem. At other times, the temperature fell to the more sober expectation of a modest agreement and a second meeting before Mr. Arafat's Sept. 13 deadline for declaring a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>But members of the Israeli delegation called home on Tuesday, leaking news that the question of Jerusalem had been under discussion since Monday and hinting at progress on this most intractable issue.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Arafat was reported to have called his headquarters in Gaza and told his aides to spread the word that he was considering packing his bags and leaving.</p>
        <p>Both sides were playing to their constituents and preparing public opinion for possible outcomes. Mr. Arafat, presumably, was showing that he was not going to give up on his long-held stance that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>As part of the same script, Mr. Barak was demonstrating that he was a man of reason, and was prepared, as Channel 2 in Israel reported on Tuesday, to make ''unprecedented steps'' toward the Palestinian position on Jerusalem. If an agreement were not reached on Jerusalem, Mr. Barak would be able to say that he had tried his best and that the Palestinians were unmovable.</p>
        <p>The newspaper Haaretz in Israel published a report in its issue today that the negotiations were focused on a package of American-negotiated proposals involving the ''core issues of borders, refugees and Jerusalem.'' The paper said Mr. Arafat had yet to approve the proposals, implying that Israel had.</p>
        <p>The proposals, as described by Haaretz, appeared close to Israeli positions, raising the possibility that they had been leaked to reassure the Israeli public. There was no immediate comment from negotiators, who have maintained public silence.</p>
        <p>According to Haaretz, the proposals included a provision for Jerusalem to remain united under Israeli sovereignty, and for Israeli annexation of major blocks of Jewish settlements in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>In return, the account said, Israel would agree to ''broad autonomy'' for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, and to accept some 100,000 Palestinian refugees into Israel -- though only in the context of family reunification, and without Israeli acceptance of responsibility for their original expulsion.</p>
        <p>The report also said Israeli officials suggested that the current meeting at Camp David could end with a partial accord, which would include some form of Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state.''</p>
        <p>Though the report could not be verified, it supported other indications that the status of Jerusalem -- one of the most highly charged issues in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians -- was at least on the table, which in itself marked progress over the seven-year time line of negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I was astonished by the degree of progress in the last few hours,'' said an Israeli who was in contact with the delegation by telephone.</p>
        <p>According to reports attributed to Israeli officials, the Israeli delegation at Camp David was presenting a plan that would incorporate the Israeli bedroom communities that are now a de facto part of the capital into the legal entity of Jerusalem. Among these West Bank settlements near Jerusalem being mentioned are Maale Advmim and Givat Zeev.</p>
        <p>The plan also calls for areas populated by Palestinians, such as Beit Hanina and the Shuafat refugee camp, to be placed under Palestinian control. The moves together would provide more demographic balance in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>But this version of a solution for Jerusalem leaves unanswered the top concerns of Mr. Arafat, who has insisted all along that East Jerusalem, annexed by the Israelis in the 1967 war, should be the capital of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>From the Palestinian point of view, the Israeli plan does not deal with the heart of the matter: it leaves under Israeli sovereignty the Old City of Jerusalem, home of the main religious sites of Judaism, Islam and Christianity.</p>
        <p>There have also been reports that Mr. Arafat has stood firm on Jerusalem, insisting that no agreement can come out of these negotiations without Palestinian control over the Al Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart stood studiously above the fray on the issue of Jerusalem. He did not utter the word Jerusalem or mention any of the other substantive matters, such as Palestinian refugees or the boundaries of a new Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Instead, through the release of bits of minutiae on who was meeting with whom, he depicted Mr. Clinton as waiting to do some down-to-the-line persuasion.</p>
        <p>Now into the eighth day, the negotiations have produced a roller-coaster of emotions, Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
        <p>''You go through various emotions, ranging from moments where you see promise, to moments where the only thing you see is frustration,'' he said on Tuesday. ''Not only the president, the leaders and all the delegations have run the entire range over the last eight days.''</p>
        <p>Given that the technique of ostentatiously threatening to walk out has been used in the past -- Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt packed his bags at Camp David 22 years ago, and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel did the same at Wye, Md., three years ago -- Mr. Lockhart was asked if a similar approach had been made this time.</p>
        <p>''Not that I know of,'' he said. ''It would be a long walk. You've got to go all the way down the mountain.''</p>
