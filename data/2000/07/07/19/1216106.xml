        <p>IN the stampede of rages, it's not as menacing as road rage or as maniacal as kiddie sports rage, and it's more down to earth than air rage. But toll rage is real.</p>
        <p>''Oh my God, people really are nasty,'' says Fay Stewart, a five-year veteran of the tollbooth at Exit 18W on the New Jersey Turnpike. ''They blame you for everything that goes wrong. Accidents, traffic. They yell and curse and throw things at you. Sometimes they say they can't wait and open the door and put the money on the ground and leave. Or they don't pay.''</p>
        <p>What do people want from toll collectors? Directions. A smile. Garbage collection. ''They say 'Would you take this?' '' said another collector, Ernesto Santana, demonstrating how people hold their trash out the window. '' 'Do you have a garbage can in there?' ''</p>
        <p>Paying a toll is one of those rare instances when you can look the tax man (or woman) in the eye and offer up a piece of your mind. So toll collectors get used to everything: damp toll cards that were used as toothpicks, change thrown at them, drive-by lectures on the work ethic.</p>
        <p>''It's frustration,'' Tom Mirandi, a toll supervisor on the Garden State Parkway,  said of drivers. ''They can't take it out on legislators or officials because they don't see them. So they take it out on the first people they see, which is the toll collector.''</p>
        <p>Now, toll rage is transcending toll plazas with fledgling citizen movements that aim to run tollbooths off the road. A group called Citizens Against Tolls -- whose Web site subtly announces ''WE HATE TOLLS!'' -- wants tollbooths removed from the Garden State Parkway and the gasoline tax increased instead. A group based in Washington, No More Tolls, has filed a federal lawsuit against state agencies from Maryland to New York, attacking tollbooths as pollution zones.</p>
        <p>''They are an insult to the people of the United States,'' said Kevin McKeown, the group's founder. ''They torture people's movement from point A to point B.''</p>
        <p>Stopping every 10 or 20 miles to practice your lay-up with a quarter and a plastic basket is fun, but it gets old after a while. (Imagine an airliner stopping at every control tower so passengers can pony up for the next leg of the journey.) E-ZPass has eased the inconvenience, but, said Richard Brodsky, a Democratic Assemblyman from Westchester County, ''Tolls are a particularly annoying form of government collecting revenue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky got the state to remove a couple of tollbooths on the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester in the 1990's. Two tollbooths high on the hit list are a Thruway toll at the Ardsley-Yonkers border (too close to the Tappan Zee Bridge) and a toll in New Rochelle on Route 95 (unfair to local drivers).</p>
        <p>State road officials say they need toll revenue for maintenance and to pay off debt, although New Jersey's governor, Christine Todd Whitman, said she would consider any legislative proposal to rid the parkway of tolls. Connecticut removed all its tollbooths after an accident at a Turnpike toll plaza killed seven people in 1983, said John Wallace, a State Department of Transportation spokesman. It replaced lost revenue with increased federal aid and an increase in the gas tax.</p>
        <p>It comes down to a question of whether roads are like public golf courses, where you pay if you play, or like public schools, which are supported by taxes because they benefit everyone, either directly or indirectly.</p>
        <p>Motorists seem to be voting daily -- at tollbooths.</p>
        <p>VIOLET WAYE, a toll taker at the Tappan Zee Bridge, said tourists  often complained about the $9 toll for motor homes, saying: ''I'm coming to the state to spend money, and you're charging me this much?'' She has some regular friendly customers who have recently been asking about the progress of her pregnancy (It's a boy!), but on days of horrendous backups, drivers often tell her: ''You should be paying us today.''</p>
        <p>Standing in a hot, fume-enveloped booth in the middle of the road is about as glamorous as it appears through the tinted glass of an air-conditioned Suburban. Pay ranges from about $22,000 to $45,000 a year on the Garden State Parkway, and you get to work with people (about 2,000 a day) and practice anger management.</p>
        <p>''They're in a hurry to nowhere,'' Greg Malcolm, a Turnpike collector, said of the rude motorists. But the joke's on them. ''They're going to the George Washington Bridge, and there's going to be a half-hour delay there.''</p>
