        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri today took himself off the list of possibilities for Vice President Al Gore's running mate.</p>
        <p>Or did he?</p>
        <p>At a news conference called to discuss tax bills, Mr. Gephardt, who has been courted by the Gore camp in recent weeks, said his priority was to stay put as the Democratic leader -- and lead his party to retake control of the House. (And, he hopes, become the next speaker.)</p>
        <p>''I've said I don't want to do that,'' Mr. Gephardt said of the No. 2 job. ''And I've said I hope and believe they'll find someone to do that other than me.''</p>
        <p>But, even as his aides insisted he had no interest in a spot on the ticket, Mr. Gephardt left the door slightly ajar, a point that was noticed by Gore aides.</p>
        <p>What if the vice president put the squeeze on him, telling him that he had to do it for the good of the party? Would Mr. Gephardt change his mind?</p>
        <p>The congressman refused to answer, saying only, ''I've been as clear as clear can be.''</p>
        <p>Pressed at another point to ''say more firmly'' that he would not join the ticket, he said: ''Well, I'm for Al Gore. You know that. I have supported him from the beginning of this campaign, almost. And I think he'd make a great president of this country. And I hope that he wins.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt -- who had considered taking Mr. Gore on in the primaries this year -- emphasized that his heart is on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''I've been very focused on one thing, and that's winning back a majority in the House,'' he said. ''I've worked very, very hard at it, and I continue to work at it every day. And so I'm preoccupied.'' He added, ''That's the only reason that I wouldn't have a different thought on this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's words must be examined carefully because there is a history of vice presidential contenders insisting they do not want the job. Sometimes they say that to appear virtuous, knowing they will not get picked anyway. Other times, they say they do not want it, but do not really mean it. Sometimes, of course, they may really mean it but can be pressed into running anyway.</p>
        <p>Even the two Republicans who many party members say have the most sizzle -- Gen. Colin L. Powell and Senator John McCain -- left a bit of maneuvering room when they ruled themselves out.</p>
        <p>''I am not a candidate for vice president,'' General Powell said recently.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain said, ''I asked that I not be considered for vice president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>That said, voters should be reminded of what a senator from Tennessee named Al Gore told Larry King on CNN in February 1992: ''I have no interest in being vice president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>William M. Daley, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, explained the feint: ''People who say, 'I have a much more important job. I'm in the United States Senate.' Give me a break!'' Mr. Daley said in an interview before he was plucked from Mr. Clinton's cabinet to run the campaign. ''This is the second most important job in the nation.''</p>
