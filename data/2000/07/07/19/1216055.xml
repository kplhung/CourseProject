        <p>Finally, Doc Mattioli could do nothing but cry.

        <p>Finally, Doc Mattioli could do nothing but cry. There had been another late night at his northeast Philadelphia dentist's office, followed by a hurried trip to a Lions Club meeting, too much dinner too fast, late-night emergency work on two patients' wisdom teeth, then the ceremonial opening of another fresh carton of Parliaments to chase the anxiety.</p>
        <p>And then something happened. Mattioli started snapping the cigarettes in two, sobbing as he vowed to quit smoking, lose weight and enjoy life more -- a lot more. It was 11 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 3, 1960, and the pace had become too much. Joe Mattioli, then 35, was about to change the direction of his life forever.</p>
        <p>''I decided that every day, I was going to have fun, or I wasn't going to do it,'' he said of his epiphany.</p>
        <p>Everything that has happened in the last 40 years has spun off that harried night. Doc Mattioli is now 75 and is the successful owner of Pocono Raceway, a racetrack in northeastern Pennsylvania where the Pennsylvania 500, the track's second Nascar Winston Cup race of the summer, will take place on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Newer and larger Winston Cup sites covet any racetrack with two Nascar dates, and nothing lasts forever, but Mattioli is confident that Pocono will hang onto its two dates -- the Pocono 500 is the other -- for a while.</p>
        <p>Mattioli's list of employees includes his wife of 52 years, Rose; three of his children and five of his grandchildren. He had a heart attack and open-heart surgery three years ago, but it is quite clear he still runs the place.</p>
        <p>''He's the guy,'' said Rose Mattioli, who as a podiatrist who practiced in the other half of the first floor of the family's home in the Rhawnhurst section of Philadelphia. ''I like to say I'm right there with him, but he's the guy who makes all the final decisions and is the spokesperson.''</p>
        <p>Not that getting to this point has always been fun, and Doc Mattioli probably works as hard now as he did way back when. The difference is that Mattioli has enjoyed the work. So, setbacks notwithstanding, it has never felt like work.</p>
        <p>Despite being in a virtually perfect location off Interstate 80 two hours west of New York and two hours north of Philadelphia, Mattioli's track floundered until recently. Doc and Rose almost went bankrupt three times, and he was seriously considering selling his racetrack in 1975 until the stock car pioneer, the late Bill France, talked him out of it. Indy-car drivers, most notably Mario Andretti, after which a Pocono access road was named, called Mattioli's track unsafe until Championship Auto Racing Teams stopped racing there in 1989.</p>
        <p>''I remember times when he put pretty much everything he had in hock,'' said his son, Joseph III, who worked for his father at Pocono and now has a motor sports marketing firm of his own. ''And I think my mother deserves a lot of credit for what has happened, too. Most women who would be in her situation would say, 'Uh, I'll pass. Let's go to the Bahamas.' But if he taught us anything, it was this: You'd better do what makes you happy.''</p>
        <p>Doc Mattioli opened his track in 1971, envisioning that Pocono would evolve into the Eastern version of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. But his Indy-car races proved to be unprofitable and his track only started to turn a corner, figuratively, when Pocono got a second Nascar race in 1982.</p>
        <p>Although only five weeks separate Pocono's two Nascar races, Mattioli expects another sellout crowd of 130,000 at Sunday's race.</p>
        <p>''His approach and hard work are very similar to what the pioneers of the sport had to go through,'' said Jim France, who is Bill France's son and is the president of International Speedway Corporation, which runs Daytona International Speedway. ''He held that operation together when it could have gone under every day of the year for several years.''</p>
        <p>Mattioli persevered and was among the first to catch the wave of stock car racing popularity. He has it made. And yet he still has been known to hop behind the wheel of a bulldozer at Pocono, 25 miles south of Wilkes-Barre, if he sees the need to smooth out some ground.</p>
        <p>He and Rose still live in a two-bedroom apartment on the premises. Family members giggle when they talk about how he wields one of those red crayon pens they once used at meat markets, always ready to make adjustments to the blueprint.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather have 130,000 happy fans than 150,000 or 170,000 fans where half of them are not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Doc Mattioli's racetrack cannot have enough toilets, for example. One of his recent pet projects was to put up signs on the buildings behind the main grandstand proudly boasting of his ''Long Johns'' as the biggest in the world. On a less frivolous note, Mattioli says that the racetrack's motto is Pocono PFC: Pretty, Friendly and Clean.</p>
        <p>''It's his sandbox,'' his 24-year-old grandson, Brandon Idgalsky, said of the racetrack.</p>
        <p>''He knows where every rock is,'' said Ashley Mattioli, a granddaughter. ''And if it's moved, he'd know where it was.''</p>
        <p>Despite that, Nascar drivers, like Indy-car drivers before them, were not too fond of coming to the track. Until Mattioli repaved it in 1995, it was notoriously bumpy. The drivers, who love the high-banked superspeedways at Daytona and Talladega, Ala., did not like the odd Pocono configuration, which looks like a lopsided coat hanger and is almost flat in the corners. Sometimes the garages flooded, and the infield was torturously slow to drain.</p>
        <p>The Mattiolis figured the only way to blunt the criticism was to continue to make changes. At first, they could not afford them. But then Nascar soared in popularity, and more people from the Northeast began to come to the races. What Doc Mattioli took in, he invested in his track. New garages and grandstands have been built in the last three years.</p>
        <p>''He has a tremendous way of processing things,'' said Looie McNally, one of his daughters. ''The information goes in, swirls around for a couple of days, then comes out as a plan.''</p>
        <p>''They don't hear the word, 'No,' '' another daughter, Michele Kulick, said of her father and her mother.</p>
        <p>''We kept it going -- just enough to keep it going,'' Doc Mattioli said.</p>
        <p>Joe Mattioli III remembers the day when his father told him to locate all the people he owed money to, a project unto itself, and began to pay off his debts. Now Doc Mattioli estimates that he and his wife own all but about 5 percent of the track.</p>
        <p>The roads to his racetrack have been widened. He is hopeful that another interchange will be built off I-80 to ease the congestion on race days. He bought a 200-acre plot adjacent to the track so that fans do not have to walk as far to get in.</p>
        <p>And the man who once crushed a carton of Parliaments now affords himself a Cuban cigar and one snifter of brandy every Sunday night -- 75th birthday presents from Rose. He celebrates a good life and good fortune, and, in a way, a promise he made to himself 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that money was ever the goal,'' said his daughter Looie. ''If it would have been, I think he would have stopped a long time ago.''</p>
