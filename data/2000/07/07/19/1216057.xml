        <p>The two Stanleys got out of hedge funds at about the same time. Now they are getting together.</p>
        <p>Stanley Shopkorn, the former chief equity trader at Salomon Brothers and most recently top equity strategist at Moore Capital's hedge funds, will join Duquesne Capital, where he will work with Stanley Druckenmiller, the former managing director of Soros Fund Management, a person who was briefed on the plans said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Druckenmiller, 47, walked away from Soros this spring after the Quantum Fund that he ran suffered substantial losses when technology stocks fell sharply in late March and April. But after taking time to travel, he decided that he would return to Duquesne, a Pittsburgh-based firm, in the fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shopkorn, 57, left Moore shortly thereafter, saying he would go on a Mediterranean cruise with his family this summer and then decide in the fall what to do next.</p>
        <p>The person who was briefed on the plans said Mr. Shopkorn would be the head of equities at Duquesne, which manages about $3 billion, while Mr. Druckenmiller would direct overall strategy as well as be involved in equities.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Duquesne Capital was not available for comment.</p>
