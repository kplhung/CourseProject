        <p>Managers at two nuclear reactors owned by the New York Power Authority asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today to block the sale of the plants to a private company, saying that the buyer was breaking promises about job security and benefits, and that the result could be low morale and ''a mass defection'' that would compromise safety.</p>
        <p>But the Power Authority and the private company, Entergy Nuclear, which have signed a $967 million sale contract, said their goal was to protect the employees at the two plants: the Indian Point 3 reactor in Buchanan, in Westchester County, and the James A.

        <p>Managers at two nuclear reactors owned by the New York Power Authority asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission today to block the sale of the plants to a private company, saying that the buyer was breaking promises about job security and benefits, and that the result could be low morale and ''a mass defection'' that would compromise safety.</p>
        <p>But the Power Authority and the private company, Entergy Nuclear, which have signed a $967 million sale contract, said their goal was to protect the employees at the two plants: the Indian Point 3 reactor in Buchanan, in Westchester County, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Scriba, in Oswego County. The contract is subject to approval by the N.R.C.</p>
        <p>Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers Union of America, which represents unionized employees at the two plants, also filed a petition with the commission raising safety concerns about the transaction, which would be the largest sale of state assets in history. Westchester County and several local governments asked the commission to extend today's deadline for filing such petitions. The Power Authority wants to close the deal by October. Entergy, of Jackson, Miss., said its offer was good until the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The N.R.C. does not normally get involved in personnel or contract issues but has sometimes become concerned if labor relations are so poor that they threaten plant safety.</p>
        <p>The managers' group at the Power Authority, the Nuclear Generation  Employees Association, represents nearly 400 employees at the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick reactors, and at offices in White Plains and Manhattan. The managers said Entergy would leave them vulnerable to layoffs and to reductions in pension and health benefits.</p>
        <p>Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the Power Authority, said of the petition: ''I think it's nonsense. Before we entertained any offer from anybody, including Entergy, one of the primary requirements was that our employees would go to the new company at the equal salary, and the same level of benefits.''</p>
        <p>Carl Crawford, a spokesman for Entergy, said his company was negotiating with benefit providers to devise a package that matched what the employees have now. Mr. Crawford acknowledged that Entergy had  told workers that benefits could be reduced after the first year, but he said that ''they could go up as well.''</p>
        <p>He said Entergy planned ''no significant layoffs'' for a year after the deal closed.</p>
        <p>Joseph R. Egan, a lawyer representing the Nuclear Generation Employees Association, said he would file suit against the Power Authority in New York to clarify its obligations.</p>
