        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Learning to Say 'I've Had Enough,' '' by Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, July 14): The argument that people who drink too much can learn to control their drinking fails to take into account that once the patient develops the medical disease of alcoholism, the liver loses its ability to process alcohol in a normal manner.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Learning to Say 'I've Had Enough,' '' by Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, July 14): The argument that people who drink too much can learn to control their drinking fails to take into account that once the patient develops the medical disease of alcoholism, the liver loses its ability to process alcohol in a normal manner.</p>
        <p>This abnormal processing of the alcohol has a devastating effect on almost every organ system (especially the liver and the brain). Once these biomedical changes occur, there is no way that the liver can go back to processing alcohol normally. Moderation management of the alcoholic is like trying to give a patient who is allergic to strawberries or penicillin a small amount of these substances and not expecting an allergic reaction.</p>
