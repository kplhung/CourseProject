        <p>When Dr. Alexandria Lawrence received her doctoral degree in May 1999 from Columbia University's Teachers College, she did not expect to end up as an assistant professor in Lehman College's education department.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't even applied for this position,'' said Dr. Lawrence, who is now coordinator of Lehman's Graduate Childhood Program and teaches classroom teachers. ''The ad had wanted a reading specialist. I teach a course on reading, but I'm not a specialist.''</p>
        <p>In fact, she had received three offers even before she donned her graduation robe. Dr. Lawrence's good fortune is a result of the ill fortune of many graduate and undergraduate teacher training programs, which are having acute problems finding good faculty members to teach prospective teachers. Although much attention has been focused on the teacher shortage faced by New York City's public schools, little has been paid to a related shortage: the metropolitan area's college education departments are facing the same crunch, and for many of the same reasons.</p>
        <p>''We have searches going on all over,'' said Dr. James Bruni, dean of the Graduate School of Education at Lehman. ''Right now, there are 13 faculty searches, in mathematics, bilingual education and special education. And, for our searches, we're seeing fewer candidates. There's much more competition for those candidates.''</p>
        <p>The intense competition to hire graduates like Dr. Lawrence suggests that some education programs either will not have the faculty to help produce the numbers of teachers needed to staff  the city's classrooms, or that they will have to compromise on whom they hire. Not only are education instructors needed to prepare the estimated 54,000 new teachers who will be hired in New York City alone during the next five years, but they are also expected to make sure that the new teachers will be better prepared to help their  students meet increasingly demanding academic requirements.</p>
        <p>The drought in prospective education faculty members is caused by deep-seated economic and social forces that have been a long time in the making, some education school deans suggest.  Dr. Alfred Posamentier, dean of the Graduate School of Education at City College, said that  education schools needed good veteran teachers for their faculties, but that supply had diminished.</p>
        <p>''It's like a reverse domino theory,'' Dr. Posamentier said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Posamentier, who is hunting for a math specialist, said that 30 years ago ''there would have been 45 people coming through the system who were math majors, were certified, had done student teaching and knew methods. Today, we have one.''</p>
        <p>Another reason for the shortage is money. Historically, schools of education have paid their faculty less than, say, business or law schools. The shortage has not yet affected salaries, deans of education said. When times have become rough, universities have usually made more severe cuts in their education departments than in  other academic departments.</p>
        <p>''Teacher educators have been notoriously underpaid,'' said Dr. Sylvia Blake, dean of the School of Education at Manhattanville College in Purchase.</p>
        <p>''Now, with the top of the public school teaching scale in the mid to high 80's, it's harder to find people who would be taking a salary cut of 50 percent to teach at the college,'' Dr. Blake said. ''Everybody is advertising for teacher educators. Ten years ago, there would have been 100 responses for an ad. Now we get about 20.''</p>
        <p>A third factor results from the gains of the  feminist movement. Many women who would previously have been channeled into teaching careers, and ultimately would have formed a well-qualified pool from which college education departments could have drawn faculty members, choose other careers.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the particular difficulties in finding classroom teachers in areas including  mathematics, science, special education and bilingual education also have an impact on recruiting faculty members in higher education.</p>
        <p>''There's a pipeline problem in virtually any of these areas,'' said Dr. Jan McDonald, dean of Pace University's Graduate School of Education. ''We're trying to hire a special educator, and there's a national critical shortage at the K-12  level.''</p>
        <p>It is particularly difficult for the graduate schools to find someone like Dr. Fernando Espinoza, who is an assistant professor in science education at Lehman. A 15-year classroom teacher of physics and earth science at a Queens Catholic high school, Dr. Espinoza has also taught physics as an adjunct faculty member at Queens  College and published scholarly articles. He has a master's degree in physics, besides a doctorate of education.</p>
        <p>''After having tried to reach students for 15 years, I thought I'd be more effective in reaching their teachers,'' Dr. Espinoza said. ''I had tenure and a well-paid job. I had to take a pay cut to come to Lehman. But the dean was very persuasive.''</p>
        <p>One change putting pressure on some programs to find additional faculty members results from the New York State Regents' requirement  that teacher training programs have a majority of full-time professors.</p>
        <p>''Hiring new faculty is difficult, and becoming expensive,'' Dr. Blake said. ''There used to be more part-time people, but with the new state  education requirements, there have to be full-time people.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McDonald, from Pace, said that the state would soon require that a larger proportion of faculty members have doctorates, ''and if the teacher doesn't have a doctorate in the field, we have to explain why.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not every school of education is having problems.</p>
        <p>Michael Jennings, associate dean at Columbia University's Teachers College, said: ''We have full-time faculty teaching our graduate students, and we tend to attract pretty good adjuncts. We're lucky.''</p>
