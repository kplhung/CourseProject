        <p>Long before Al Groh was an apple-cheeked assistant coach at West Point, there were a pair of Heisman Trophy winners at Army known as Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside. They were, respectively, the running backs Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis.</p>
        <p>Now Groh, the Jets' new head coach, has brought in a talented pair of defensive rushers, both of whom will be taking an outside path to get to the opposing team's quarterback.</p>
        <p>One is the team's top draft pick, defensive end Shaun Ellis. The other is the team's second pick of the opening round, linebacker John Abraham. If they both make an impact, the Jets will have two Mr. Outsides and far better sack statistics than they did a year ago.</p>
        <p>Ellis, a nationally noted star at Tennessee, was on the Jets' drawing board all of last season as a likely top pick. But Abraham, performing for the struggling South Carolina Gamecocks, came with less fanfare. That is one reason Groh and some Jets veterans are already expressing pleasure with the way Abraham has performed in training camp.</p>
        <p>The Jets had the poorest sack record in the league last season, with the exception of the first-year Cleveland Browns team. The Jets' pass-rushers got to the quarterback only 26 times, so pass-rushing became a priority and Ellis and Abraham became the first two picks.</p>
        <p>''Someone told me a long time ago that draft choices are like Christmas presents,'' Mike Nolan, the team's new defensive coordinator, said. ''Until you open them you don't know what you have.''</p>
        <p>But Groh said he knows this: ''One of the things that gets veterans interested in helping is how a player responds,'' he said. ''John comes in, keeps his mouth shut, works hard.</p>
        <p>''What really warmed the other players up is they said, 'This guy can help us win.' ''</p>
        <p>Abraham had six sacks for South Carolina a year ago. That was then. His role on the Jets will be more situational. He will not play every down, but he will be on the field in crucial situations.</p>
        <p>After Abraham drove back left guard Kerry Jenkins in a drill this morning, linebacker Bryan Cox said of the rookie, ''He's very, very mean.''</p>
        <p>While Ellis impresses with his size -- 6 feet 5 inches and 280 pounds -- the 6-4, 250-pound Abraham turns heads with his speed.</p>
        <p>Cox, the most outspoken Jet on defense, said that in his two previous seasons, several of the Jets' high draft picks ''got a pass, a chance to hang around for a few years.''</p>
        <p>''But these guys,'' Cox said of Ellis and Abraham, ''they seem like they can help us.''</p>
        <p>Abraham says his mother is his role model.</p>
        <p>''She cooks in a school kitchen in Timmonsville, Ga.,'' he said. ''But she looked at her job as if she was president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>Abraham is looking at his job as if he knows nothing. He told the veteran linebacker Mo Lewis: ''I envy you. It takes a big man to be around for 10 years and still produce.''</p>
        <p>Abraham asks Lewis questions. He asks Cox questions. He worries when Ray Hamilton, the defensive line coach who is teaching him pro pass-rushing techniques, yells. He is concerned when the linebacker coach Bob Sutton warns him not to fall for a quarterback's feint when back in pass protection.</p>
        <p>''Coach Hamilton tells me things,'' Abraham said, ''like how to use my eyes to throw off a guy. Make him think I'm going one way, and take off in the other.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton, whose last stint here helped make a big-league pass rusher out of an inexperienced Hugh Douglas, said of Abraham, ''John is very fast and has a relentlessness about him.''</p>
        <p>So while Abraham talks about the difficulty of learning to play, in combination, the pass, the run and the role of quarterback stalker, he has quickly learned this much: ''They drafted me for the pass rush,'' he said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>VICTOR GREEN, the strong safety who said he never missed a practice during the three years of the BILL PARCELLS reign, sustained a knee injury in the morning, immediately went for an M.R.I. and came back to see limited action in the afternoon's special-teams drills. Green has played 76 consecutive games as a Jet, the longest current streak. After learning that the results of the test were negative, and after hearing Green say it was more important to play than to practice, AL GROH said, ''That's his opinion.'' . . . DENNIS O'SULLIVAN, an undrafted free-agent player out of Tulane, has apparently landed the long snapper's job. He will replace JOHN HUDSON, who in four years never played a down except to hike the ball and never produced a bad snap. . . . YATIL GREEN, who is trying to catch on as a big-play receiver after an injury-plagued career with the Miami Dolphins, made a nifty catch over the middle in traffic.</p>
