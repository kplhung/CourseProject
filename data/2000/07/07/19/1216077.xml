        <p>A quarter of a century after the New York State Financial Control Board helped rescue the city from near financial collapse, the body is so far out of the limelight today that when its top executive tells strangers where he works, the first question he usually gets is, ''What is that?''</p>
        <p>''Things have quieted down,'' said Jeffrey L. Sommer, acting executive director of the Control Board, which has its annual meeting today to review city finances, the only scheduled gathering of the seven-member board this year. ''There seems to be no interest'' in the board's dealings, he added.</p>
        <p>At its infancy, the board ordered hundreds of millions of dollars in city budget cuts, demanded the layoffs of thousands of city workers and rejected teachers' and transit workers' contracts. Even rumors floating from its 21st floor Broadway offices, overlooking City Hall, would generate front-page news.</p>
        <p>''On an almost daily basis we got calls from the board on problems we had to solve, cuts we had to make,'' said Donald D. Kummerfeld, budget director under Abraham D. Beame, the former mayor. ''The power of the purse in government is the ultimate power. And they had it.''</p>
        <p>Edward I. Koch, never one to concede a battle, yesterday recalled breakfast meetings he organized at Gracie Mansion with the Control Board staff and important members to try to smoothe out disputes. ''I fought with them on occasion,'' said Mr. Koch, who once described the city as an ''indentured servant,'' of the Control Board. ''Generally, they won.''</p>
        <p>But yesterday, the day at the Control Board headquarters began with an eerie silence. Hour upon hour passed and not a single inquiry came in response to the board's just-released critique of the city budget. When one reporter called minutes before the close of business, Mr. Sommer could not hold back his surprise.</p>
        <p>''I just got off the phone from New York 1,'' said Mr. Sommer, 52, a Brooklyn native and lawyer, referring to the cable TV news station. ''What a shock.'' It had been three years since Mr. Sommer, who started his government career as a lobbyist in the John V. Lindsay administration and today is paid $124,000 a year, had gotten a call from a City Hall reporter about one of his budget releases, he said.</p>
        <p>There is a good reason for the decline in the Control Board's stature. The board, formed by the State Legislature and Gov. Hugh L. Carey in September 1975 as the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, still has the same heavy-hitting members, including the current governor, mayor and city and state comptrollers.</p>
        <p>But New York City, thanks to a three-year-running economic boom, just ended its 2000 fiscal year with an estimated $3.2 billion surplus, a figure all but unimaginable just a few years ago.</p>
        <p>''It is a reflection of the prosperity of the city that it has become an obscure body,'' said Felix G. Rohatyn, who served as a Control Board member during its first two years, as well as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a related body that issued debt for the city during the financial crisis. ''It is only necessary when things are very, very bad.''</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration is so confident of the city's fiscal stability today that it would like to see the Control Board with even less clout:  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget director suggested yesterday that the Control Board or the office of the State Deputy Comptroller for New York City, a second state agency assigned to monitor city finances, should be abolished.</p>
        <p>''There are people there making a lot of money and all they are doing is echoing each other's reports,'' said Adam L. Barsky, director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Even State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a frequent critic of the Giuliani administration, says he wonders how the 19-person Control Board staff keeps itself busy, at a cost of $2.1 million a year to city taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''It has become kind of perfunctory,'' Mr. McCall said. His solution is to instruct the board's staff to delve deeper into the city's budget affairs. ''It is during good times that government often does bad things,'' said Mr. McCall, who intends to warn fellow board members at today's meeting that the city is spending too much of its $3.2 billion surplus to just balance the 2001 fiscal year's budget, leaving it with an unusually large deficit the administration expects it could face in 2002.</p>
        <p>At its birth, when it was called the Emergency Financial Control Board, it approved -- or rejected -- all city budgets, contracts and labor deals. Mr. Kummerfeld at times in the late 1970's found himself so subservient to the Control Board, he said, that he had a humorous nickname for its executive director at the time, Stephen Berger, who was bald and had a closely cropped beard and mustache. ''He reminded an awful lot of people on our side of the street of the devil,'' Mr. Kummerfeld said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch, who became mayor in 1978, described it as more of a ''good guy-bad guy'' routine between the mayor and the Control Board, as the mayor remembered telling labor union leaders: ''You better make my life easier than you are making it. If not I will just let the Control Board decide your increase.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, after affirming that the city had balanced its budget for three consecutive years, paid off its federally guaranteed debt and restored its credit-worthiness, the board went into what the law calls ''sunset'' status: it voted to drop its power over city budgets and contracts, becoming little more than a monitor that issued quarterly reports on the city's finances.</p>
        <p>Although it threatened to reassume control of the city's finances in 1991, its stature has been shrinking in recent years. The office of the executive director is unoccupied: the board has been without a permanent director since last November, and Mr. Sommer, not wanting to be too presumptuous, has stayed in his long-held deputy director's office.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the board, which has had its commanding perch at 270 Broadway since 1975, is moving next week to rented space at 123 Williams Street, farther from City Hall, with a lease that expires in 2008, the year the board is set by law to go out of business.</p>
        <p>Today, a resolution has already been prepared declaring again that the ''sunset'' conditions have been met, and that the board does not have to reactivate its original powers. Predicting the outcome of the vote is not too risky. It has been years, anyway, since a resolution passed by anything less than unanimity.</p>
