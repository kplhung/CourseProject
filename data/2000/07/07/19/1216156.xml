        <p>Continuing record increases, the average price for apartments in much of Manhattan climbed by nearly 50 percent in the first six months of the year compared with the same time period last year, according to data from two real estate industry reports that are scheduled for release next month.</p>
        <p>The average price for an apartment between southern Harlem and the Wall Street area rose to $757,475, a 45 percent increase over last year's figure, $521,830, according to the combined data from the Corcoran Report and the Douglas Elliman Manhattan Market Report.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Corcoran and Douglas Elliman brokerage agencies said the increase resulted from condominium construction. The Corcoran data showed that the average condo price jumped 54 percent, to $967,000. The Elliman data showed a 45 percent increase, to $994,429.</p>
        <p>While both reports conclude that the Manhattan real estate market will reach record highs, there are some signs of a slowdown. According to the Corcoran data, sales were down 36 percent, to 4,781, during the first half of 2000, from 7,485 during the first half of 1999. The Elliman data showed sales down 4 percent, to 4,570, compared with 4,781.</p>
