        <p>In the 11 months since his right knee was twisted awkwardly beneath a pile of bodies during a team scrimmage, Conrad Hamilton's rehabilitation of the injury has been fraught with uncertainty. The original prognosis was for Hamilton to miss only a few weeks; instead he missed 13 games of the 1999 season. Then, he missed all of the team's spring minicamps this year. And yesterday, the Giants released Hamilton, saying they still did not believe his knee was sound.</p>
        <p>The team announced that Hamilton had failed a physical as the Giants prepared to open training camp in Albany on Friday. Had the Giants kept Hamilton on their roster when camp opened, they would have been obligated to pay him his 2000 salary, which is $440,000.</p>

        <p>In the 11 months since his right knee was twisted awkwardly beneath a pile of bodies during a team scrimmage, Conrad Hamilton's rehabilitation of the injury has been fraught with uncertainty. The original prognosis was for Hamilton to miss only a few weeks; instead he missed 13 games of the 1999 season. Then, he missed all of the team's spring minicamps this year. And yesterday, the Giants released Hamilton, saying they still did not believe his knee was sound.</p>
        <p>The team announced that Hamilton had failed a physical as the Giants prepared to open training camp in Albany on Friday. Had the Giants kept Hamilton on their roster when camp opened, they would have been obligated to pay him his 2000 salary, which is $440,000.</p>
        <p>''There comes a point in time when you have to make a decision on whether or not you think a guy can come back and play during the season,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ''We reached that point.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton, 25, was the Giants' seventh-round draft pick from Eastern New Mexico in 1996. A free agent this winter, he re-signed with the team in February. Shortly thereafter, he had additional surgery on his knee, and predictions about the length of recovery were vague.</p>
        <p>Hamilton played in 16 games during the 1998 season, replacing the injured Jason Sehorn. Hamilton played well and was expected to have a big role as a nickel defensive back in 1999. He was also expected to be the starting left cornerback this year. That job, for now, belongs to Dave Thomas, a free agent signed this year from Jacksonville.</p>
        <p>With some salary cap maneuverability, the Giants may pursue another veteran cornerback should one become available as other teams pare their rosters as camps open, or as rosters are trimmed next month.</p>
        <p>''We are disappointed but there is a point when clubs have to make personnel decisions regarding their roster,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said. ''We left the door open for the future if Conrad is physically ready to play and is interested in playing.''</p>
