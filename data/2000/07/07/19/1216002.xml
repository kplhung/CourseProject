        <p>Europe's summer opera festivals are often judged by the cachet of those they attract, not only the artistic renown of the conductors, directors and performers but also the social standing of the audiences. But there is another less obvious gauge: which festivals stay alive during their long off-seasons by taking their productions to other cities, perhaps even to other festivals.</p>
        <p>By both measures, things have been going well for the international opera festival of Aix-en-Provence since a management shake-up in 1998. This year's festival, which runs through July 28, includes four new productions and a repeat from 1999, all presented by big-name conductors and directors, while its sold-out houses visibly sparkle with European elites. At the same time, opera lovers who cannot make it here are increasingly able to catch its shows elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''It's important to make the festival known around the world,'' explained Stephane Lissner, who took over as director of the festival three years ago with precisely that mandate. ''Many of our productions are in demand even before they are created. What makes Aix different, though, is that we concentrate on young singers, and the tours give them the chance to be seen and heard by directors, critics and audiences in other cities.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Lissner's first season three productions -- Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' Purcell's ''Dido and Aeneas'' and Britten's ''Curlew River'' -- traveled widely around Western Europe. Last year it was the turn of Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' to tour European cities, while Aix's version of Monteverdi's ''Coronazione di Poppea'' was seen in Vienna (and returned here this year) and its production of Offenbach's ''Belle Helene'' will be performed next month at the Salzburg Festival.</p>
        <p>This year's productions will also carry the Aix brand name to new arenas. Janacek's ''Makropulos Case'' is scheduled for the Theatre de la Monnaie in Brussels this fall and may be seen in Paris and Vienna, too. Monteverdi's ''Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria'' and Rossini's ''Cenerentola'' will have long European tours, and Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' will travel to the Theatre des Champs-Elysees in Paris in October and probably to the Lincoln Center Festival next summer.</p>
        <p>Of course some features of the Aix festival remain very much rooted in this medieval Provencal town. The European Music Academy, created by Mr. Lissner in 1998, brings together 100 or so young singers and instrumentalists for two months of workshops, concerts and new opera productions (this year, ''La Cenerentola'').</p>
        <p>At the same time this summer's parallel program of concerts has attracted star conductors like Pierre Boulez, Sir Simon Rattle and William Christie as well as the rising British conductor Daniel Harding.</p>
        <p>Still, it is the opera program that generally stirs the most interest, with particular attention given this year to the new production of ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' the first Western opera to be tackled by Chen Shi-Zheng, the New York-based Chinese director who took the epic Chinese opera ''The Peony Pavilion'' to last year's Lincoln Center Festival. The production was accompanied by the Concerto Koln, conducted by the Belgian baroque specialist Rene Jacobs.</p>
        <p>'' 'Cosi' is staged so often that my worry was, could I do something different?'' Mr. Chen said after the premiere. ''I didn't want to go through the psychoanalytical approach of Western theater. I wanted to challenge what Western audiences think the opera is about by playing it in a different environment. I didn't want to make a moral statement about infidelity, but to entertain, so it plays out like a children's game, a sort of teenage opera.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen creates an Asian mood through Peter Pabst's set, with its willow tree and lilies floating in pools of water, and the kimonolike costumes for Fiordiligi (sung here by Alexandra Deshorties) and Dorabella (Liliana Nikiteanu). Yet it is the mischievous humor of the production that provides its appeal, with Guglielmo (Stephan Genz) and Ferrando (Jeremy Ovenden) joking and teasing as they test the flightiness of Fiordiligi and Dorabella under the lighthearted guidance of Don Alfonso (Pietro Spagnoli).</p>
        <p>''The Makropulos Case,'' on the other hand, is a far more somber affair in Aix's new production by the talented young French director Stephane Braunschweig, with Sir Simon Rattle conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. This opera, which tells the story of a century-old dispute between two Czech families, revolves around the mysteriously old Emilia Marty. And with the veteran German soprano Anja Silja returning to the role that she first sang in 1972, the high drama of the story was more than assured.</p>
        <p>Le Monde's music critic, Alain Lompech, went out of his way to praise Ms. Silja's majestic domination of the stage, which, he said, more than compensated for occasional signs of age in her voice. But he insisted that the entire cast as well as director, designer and conductor were ''touched by grace'' in this production. ''One emerges from this performance not just moved,'' he added, ''but shaken by some unforgettable scenes in which it is impossible to separate seeing from hearing.''</p>
        <p>''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and ''The Makropulos Case'' were staged in the courtyard of the old Archbishop's Palace in Aix, and ''La Cenerentola'' was performed outdoors in the Domaine du Grand St.-Jean, an 18th-century chateau six miles from here that was added to the festival's venues last year. And ''Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria'' seemed like the perfect opera for the 485-seat Theatre du Jeu-de-Paume, an 18th-century jewel that has just had a $5 million restoration.</p>
        <p>Adrian Noble, who heads the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed the opera with a simplicity that well suited the intimacy of the theater, while the Orchestre Les Arts Florissants, using period instruments, was conducted by its founder, Mr. Christie. ''Noble has created a spectacle of unusual depth with almost nothing,'' Renaud Machart, another Le Monde critic, noted of the minimalist decor. At the same time the youthful energy of the singers, notably Kresimir Spicer as Ulisse and Marijana Mijanovic as his loyal wife, Penelope, brought lightness to what is, after all, a long opera.</p>
        <p>The festival has now presented Monteverdi's three surviving operas in successive years. But with Mozart, around whom this festival was founded in 1948, there is of course much more to do. Next year ''The Marriage of Figaro'' will be directed by Sir Richard Eyre, the former head of Britain's National Theater, with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra conducted by Marc Minkowski.</p>
        <p>But the 20th century will not be overlooked. In a production directed by Luc Bondy and conducted by Mr. Harding, Britten's ''Turn of the Screw'' will be presented in the Jeu-de-Paume.</p>
