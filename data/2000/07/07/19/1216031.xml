        <p>STADIUMS and arenas come and go every few decades. Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field have endured longer than most. Lambeau Field is a relative youngster. Madison Square Garden's address has never been the same for too long. But golf's spiritual stage, the Old Course at St. Andrews, is not that much different than when God designed it.</p>
        <p>In 1574 a University of St. Andrews student, James Melville, wrote in his diary that his father had provided him with ''clubs and balls for golf but nothing for hand tennis or drinking in the pub.'' His father knew best.</p>
        <p>This auld gray toon is known as the ''Home of Golf,'' and at 8 The Links, in an 18th century stone-and-mortar building across from the British Open throngs huddled behind the out-of-bounds stakes near the 18th green, is golf's most enduring pro shop.</p>
        <p>''Tom Morris Golf Shop (established 1848),'' reads the sign above the window display of shirts and sweaters where the original club-making workbench was. ''Open Champion 1861-62-64-67-68-69-70-72.''</p>
        <p>Next to the blue door with the small white-on-black sign ''Tom Morris Ltd. registered office'' is a life-size wooden cutout of Old Tom himself: tweed cap, bushy beard, green suit, holding a baffy. Every so often, a visitor stops and poses next to that cutout for a snapshot.</p>
        <p>''Some customers know who Old Tom was, some don't,'' the shop owner, Bryan Anderson, said. ''During the '90 Open, some chock-a-block middle-aged woman from the other side of the pond was in here and said, 'Who is Tom Morris anyway?' and there was this sudden deathly hush.''</p>
        <p>And for anyone else who didn't know, Tiger Woods put Old Tom in perspective last month at the United States Open at Pebble Beach when his 15-shot victory set a record for a major tournament. The previous record was Old Tom's 13-shot victory in the 1862 British Open.</p>
        <p>''There was no reaction in town,'' Bryan Anderson said. ''It was time that record was broken. Maybe if Tiger had done it in the Open, there would have been a reaction.''</p>
        <p>Over here there is only one ''Open.'' It starts tomorrow on the same first tee where Old Tom drove off and ends Sunday on the same 18th green across from Old Tom's shop where he made golf clubs that, compared to today's high-tech shapes and styles, resembled hoes and rakes. But you could shoot a score with them.</p>
        <p>''Old Tom died upstairs,'' Bryan Anderson said. ''So did Young Tom.''</p>
        <p>The sign on the shop boasts of the eight Morris victories in the Open: Old Tom's four, Young Tom's four, all at Prestwick. Three years after Young Tom's last victory, both his wife and first baby didn't survive childbirth, then he died suddenly at age 24. Of a broken heart, they say.</p>
        <p>Old Tom's great-great granddaughter, Sheila Mould, his only surviving relative, still lives upstairs from the shop.</p>
        <p>''My grandfather,'' Bryan Anderson said, ''came into partnership with Old Tom's great-granddaughter, Bunty Mould. That's how I got to be in the shop.''</p>
        <p>''And when we looked behind that wall over there,'' said Bryan's brother Michael, ''I found an old gutta-percha ball and an old hickory shaft.''</p>
        <p>During the 1960 Open, Arnold Palmer walked into the shop with Gary Player's golf clubs. Bryan Anderson's father, Morris, regripped them.</p>
        <p>''At the 1964 Open we were still making clubs here,'' Anderson said. ''When my father brought some Open hats into the shop, my grandfather told him: 'Take them back. This is a golf shop.' My father said, 'I can't, I've already sold some.' When the remaining hats sold out quickly, my grandfather didn't object to my father bringing in other merchandise.''</p>
        <p>Although the Morris shop still sells some clubs, during the Open it's strictly shirts, sweaters, hats and Old Course souvenirs.</p>
        <p>And whenever visitors walked out the door with a purchase during the practice rounds this week, golfers were coming up to the 18th green, as Tiger Woods himself was early Monday evening.</p>
        <p>''Look, he's putting,'' someone said.</p>
        <p>From beyond the deep swale known as the Valley of Sin in front of the 18th green, the champion of the Open across the pond was not chipping or pitching his ball. Using a putter, he knocked it across the dip in the smooth fairway and watched it roll up onto the green.</p>
        <p>Just the way Old Tom Morris did.</p>
