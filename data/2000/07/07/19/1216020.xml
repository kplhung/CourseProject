        <p>BUSINESS travelers who go online for information might consider bookmarking the new Federal Aviation Administration Web site that gives real-time information on flight delays. It is www.fly.faa.gov. The ''fly'' in the Web address is amusingly optimistic. ''No fly'' would be more accurate these days.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, for example, delays began piling up on Friday, when many flights from the Midwest to the East Coast were running eight hours late. The national airspace became snarled again on Sunday. On the F.A.A. site, you could click on links to 40 major airports and observe, from Denver to the Atlantic, a system approaching gridlock.</p>
        <p>Of course, you could also go to the airport, wade through the crowd of long faces and find one that did not look ready to explode. At Newark International Airport around 9:30 p.m. on Friday, one of those calmer visages belonged to Derrick Canady, a computer network executive from Denver who was having a long day.</p>
        <p>''I left home at 6:30 this morning for a business trip to Fort Lauderdale,'' Mr. Canady said as fellow-travelers milled around, some anxiously pressing cell phones to their ears and muttering darkly when they could not get a line because the demand was overloading the circuits.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't tell us what was going on, which really annoyed me,'' Mr. Canady said. He was flying on Continental Airlines, but his complaint about not being able to get adequate information was echoed by other travelers on other carriers. Most scoffed when asked if their airlines had kept them informed.</p>
        <p>Providing credible, timely information on delays is a major component of a vaunted voluntary passengers-rights code that the airlines drafted last year to head off the threat of federal regulations.</p>
        <p>''When we asked what was going on, the airline's people looked at us like we were crazy,'' Mr. Canady said. ''We were like, 'Hey, we're just trying to find out when we're going to be where you're supposed to take us.' ''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Some people were getting in shouting matches with the flight attendants, but what good does that do? You might as well make the best of it.''</p>
        <p>Making the best of it is good advice for business travelers this summer, as a three-year crisis of delayed domestic flights threatens to grow in the heaviest travel months of July and August. According to the F.A.A., June was the worth month ever for delays.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, last Friday afternoon, as serial delays were once again staggering the traveling public, the F.A.A. and the airline industry were trying to spin some good news. The F.A.A. said that an agreement had been reached with airline pilots' groups in a recent dispute involving a decades-old landing procedure that some pilots believe can create potentially unsafe conditions as runway traffic increases. New rules to address the pilots' concerns are expected to be issued in mid-August.</p>
        <p>In the procedure, called ''land and hold short,'' the tower asks a pilot to land normally and then pause at an intersecting runway to allow another plane to take off before continuing on to the terminal. Pilots balking at these maneuvers were responsible for about 10 percent of the recent delays at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and about a quarter of the delays at Logan International Airport in Boston, according to industry estimates.</p>
        <p>But those numbers do not begin to account for the 49,000 flight delays the airlines racked up in June or the ones piling up this month. Pilots aren't causing this crisis. The great majority of delays are attributed to bad weather; huge, growing volume; and the inability of the air-traffic control system and the airlines to keep pace.</p>
        <p>The number of domestic airline passengers has doubled since 1980. The airlines are putting more planes in the air each year -- a trend that is aggravated by growing use of smaller-capacity, fuel-efficient regional jets. More planes in the air means more planes that can be affected by weather.</p>
        <p>Short of requiring people to stay on the ground, there are no easy answers. As delays grow, F.A.A. critics denounce the agency for bureaucratic ineptitude, and some are even calling for privatization of the air-traffic control system. But opponents of this proposal question of the wisdom of effectively ceding control of the nation's air space to the airline industry, which they say already has a propensity for discouraging competition and consolidating routes and airport gate slots into regional quasi monopolies.</p>
        <p>At Newark last Friday night, though, all of this was somewhat academic. There, and in airports all over the country, the concerns were more narrowly focused on the simple challenge of reaching a destination.</p>
        <p>''Now I have to pay for a hotel,'' Mr. Canady said, finally acknowledging defeat as the tote boards blinked one cancellation after another. ''And all the flights I checked for Fort Lauderdale tomorrow are overbooked already. So tomorrow, I might just get a plane get back home to Denver instead. I'll start out again after the weekend. I ought to be able to get there eventually, right?''</p>
