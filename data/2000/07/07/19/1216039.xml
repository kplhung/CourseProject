        <p>On the eve of its semiannual MacWorld trade show, Apple Computer today delivered mixed quarterly returns, with earnings exceeding analyst expectations but sales falling short of projections in light of disappointing sales of the iMac, the company's staple consumer computer.</p>
        <p>But Apple executives promised to introduce new products on Wednesday at MacWorld in New York that they suggested should spur sales.</p>
        <p>For its third quarter, which ended July 1, Apple reported earnings of $163 million, or 45 cents a share, a penny more a share than analysts estimated. That figure compares with $114 million, or 35 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.</p>
        <p>The figure does not include $37 million in capital gains the company reported from the sale of some of its shares of ARM Holdings during the quarter. Taking those returns into account, the company reported earnings of $200 million, or 55 cents a share, though analysts said the capital gain was a one-time return that should not be included in an analysis of Apple's operating fiscal health.</p>
        <p>But the good news on earnings was tempered by lower-than expected sales of $1.83 billion. That is 17 percent higher than the $1.56 billion a year ago, but lower than the $1.9 billion many analysts expected for the quarter.</p>
        <p>''It's a mixed quarter -- the revenue line was a tad disappointing,'' said Charlie Wolf, executive director of UBS Warburg, a New York-based investment bank.</p>
        <p>One reason revenues were below expectations was because sales of the company's colorful iMac computers fell short of both company and analyst projections. Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, said 450,000 iMac's were sold in the quarter, not the 500,000 Apple had initially projected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said he believed the drop was due to potential customers waiting for a new version of the iMac.</p>
        <p>''We believe that anticipation of a refresh of our product family was the primary factor,'' Mr. Anderson said during a conference call, though he declined to be specific about the product announcements.</p>
        <p>It has been a year since the company announced an upgrade of the iMac model.</p>
        <p>''It's been about nine months since we've made any major product introductions but we're going to change that tomorrow and we think you will be impressed,'' Mr. Anderson said, apparently referring not just to iMac but to other Apple products.</p>
        <p>Apple has long used the MacWorld stage as a forum for introducing new products, typically keeping the announcements a secret until the day of the show. Industry analysts speculated today that Apple would likely update the iMac but also announce entirely new products, including, perhaps, a low-cost device to connect to the Internet.</p>
        <p>But analysts said that the announcements might obscure any clear stock market response to today's earnings, since the products will be introduced during the keynote address of Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, shortly after the market opens. ''There is not going to be any pure play on the earnings,'' Mr. Wolf said.</p>
        <p>Today, the stock fell $1.0625, to $57.25, on the Nasdaq. It fell as low as $53 in after-hours trading. The stock has more than doubled in the last 12 months but is down about one quarter from its high in March.</p>
        <p>The reason that earnings rose despite disappointing sales may be explained by an increase in the company's gross margins, a measure of how much the company's sales exceeded the cost of producing its goods. In the quarter, the company reported gross margins of 29.8 percent, Mr. Anderson said, compared with 28.2 percent last quarter.</p>
        <p>David C. Bailey, a research analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &amp; Company, said the gross margin increase exceeded his estimate of 28.7 percent for the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson attributed the increase in gross margins to three factors: lower costs for components; growth in Internet sales, which have higher margins; and a higher mix of sales being from its professional line of products, the Power Book and Power Mac.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Anderson cautioned that the gross margin would likely fall again in the coming months because of expected increases in the costs of components, notably in memory and optical devices. He said the company hoped to keep margins around 27 percent.</p>
