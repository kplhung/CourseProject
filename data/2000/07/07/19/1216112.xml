        <p>The annual inflation rate for the Irish economy rose to 5.5 percent for the year ended June 30, an increase of 0.3 percent from May, according to figures published by the Central Statistics Office. While the increase was less than many analysts had feared, the Bank of Ireland forecast a rise to an annual rate of 6.2 percent in July. The Irish government has taken steps recently to hold down prices in the pub trade, health care and the housing markets, where inflationary pressures were greatest. This week, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, above, instructed his cabinet members to ask industry leaders to avoid unnecessary price increases.</p>
