        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Learning to Say 'I've Had Enough,' '' by Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, July 14):</p>
        <p>I was a heavy drinker for 25 years.  About eight years ago, my doctor discovered that I was diabetic and suggested that I cut down. I said, No, I'll just quit. It was easy for me to quit drinking, but in the process I discovered that I had a more serious addiction to sugary foods and drinks, which are also dangerous for my health.</p>
        <p>This situation led me to formulate a theory of addiction: there are simple addicts and complex addicts. In the case of a simple addict, there may be physical cravings and withdrawal symptoms but no deep psychological dependence. But in complex addictions, the substance has a psychological hold on the person.</p>
        <p>Sweets are like this for me. Here, I use abstinence; it restores my control and reduces the addiction to a simpler physical level, which I can handle. But abstinence is not necessarily an end in itself.</p>
