        <p>When Attorney General Marzuki Darusman began investigating former President Suharto and his family on charges of corruption last year, he expected strong resistance from the elite, which benefited greatly under the strongman's rule.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki, a reformist known for his human rights work, also expected sharp criticism from leftist groups and student protesters for not being more aggressive in prosecuting Mr. Suharto, who governed Indonesia for 32 years, until he was forced to step down two years ago.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Marzuki said he never expected that his inquiry into whether Mr. Suharto's vast fortune was amassed at public expense would make him a target of violence, as it did on July 5, when a bomb exploded in his office.</p>
        <p>''We never thought that anyone would go this far, to such an extreme,'' Mr. Marzuki said in an interview in his heavily guarded office. ''But this shows that we are making progress toward our goal.''</p>
        <p>That goal extends far beyond punishing Mr. Suharto and his cronies for reported abuses. The attorney general said his objective was to restore the rule of law and a sense of equality to Indonesia, where corruption permeated nearly every aspect of society under Mr. Suharto's government. That is a colossal task that could cost Mr. Marzuki, who has expressed presidential ambitions, his political career, if not his life.</p>
        <p>''The attorney general is one of the few politicians who is earnestly committed to implementing democracy and establishing the supremacy of law at great personal risk to himself,'' said Umar Juoro, director of the Center for Information and Development Studies, a research group. ''The broader question is how long will this attorney general last in office, and the answer depends on the president and Darusman's political and social connections.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki, 55, has emerged as perhaps the most prominent minister of the fledging government of President Abdurrahman Wahid, who took power in October in Indonesia's first contested presidential election. Mr. Wahid's government has undertaken an ambitious agenda to rebuild Indonesia, which has the world's fourth-largest population, into a modern democracy.</p>
        <p>But Indonesia has been plagued with political infighting and rising sectarian violence that has killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. The government has attributed much of the unrest to political and military forces that are loyal to Mr. Suharto and seek to destabilize the country.</p>
        <p>The police say they believe that Mr. Suharto's sympathizers were behind the bombing of the attorney general's office, which occurred shortly after one of Mr. Suharto's sons had been questioned in connection with the corruption charges. The blast destroyed part of a building where the attorney general is compiling records for the case. The day after the attack, the police defused a second bomb in the building. Forensic evidence suggests that the explosives were from the army, the police said.</p>
        <p>Despite the attack, Mr. Marzuki pledged to press the case, which he plans to hand over to a court for trial sometime before Aug. 10.</p>
        <p>''There is a strong element of apprehension in this office after the bombing incident,'' he said. ''But we've come so far that we can't really turn around now. Our investigators feel that the case is solid and that there's not much the opposition can do to deter us.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, it would be hard for Mr. Marzuki to back down. When he took office last year, the attorney general pledged that as a first step toward restoring confidence in the government he planned aggressive prosecutions of cases that involved high officials. In addition to Mr. Suharto's case, Mr. Marzuki is investigating a political financing scandal in the banking system and human rights abuses by the military in Aceh and East Timor.</p>
        <p>''These three cases are crucial, because they will go a long way in convincing the public that this government has the legitimacy to clean up this very messy situation,'' Mr. Marzuki said. ''At no point in this country's history has there been greater pressure from the public to rectify things and correct past ills.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki was appointed attorney general last year after having led the National Commission on Human Rights, where he investigated complaints against the military over kidnappings, mass killings and rapes.</p>
        <p>''We saw case after case in which army personnel were committing grave crimes and being allowed to go scot-free,'' Mr. Marzuki said. ''When you see these things firsthand, you don't forget them, and something inside drives you to want to change the situation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki made his mark in political circles as a respected reformer in the Golkar Party, Mr. Suharto's longtime machine. He was instrumental in rallying party support for Mr. Wahid's election.</p>
        <p>The eldest son of a former diplomat, Mr. Marzuki spent his formative years living in Mexico, Russia, and Switzerland. He said that as a youth growing up overseas he first recognized the inequities of Indonesian society compared with the West.</p>
        <p>His critics maintain that although the attorney general has pursued high-profile cases with fanfare, he has been slow to clean his own house. Mr. Marzuki promised to replace dozens of assistant attorney generals and senior prosecutors who were known to be corrupt, but many of them have kept their posts.</p>
        <p>J. E. Sahetapy, chairman of the National Law Commission, which Mr. Wahid set up to chart a course for legal reform, said he would score Mr. Marzuki's performance a 6.5 out of 10 points. Mr. Sahetapy said he was deeply concerned that the attorney general had failed to go after Mr. Suharto's accomplices in the corruption inquiry.</p>
        <p>''He's only pursued the case to a certain point, because many of his colleagues from his own party are involved,'' Mr. Sahetapy said. ''Most of the people who are now in power are involved."</p>
        <p>Mr. Marzuki acknowledged that much work was left to be done. ''The successful prosecution of these cases will only restore minimal confidence in the system,'' he said. ''Then comes the hard point of real reform, which will take years if not decades.''</p>
