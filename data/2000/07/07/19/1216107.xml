        <p>Before a photograph of a man being frisked by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was released last week, the State Supreme Court had already agreed to hear the man's appeal in an unrelated drug case, his lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dennis Wixted, the lawyer for Sherron Rolax, 21, of Camden, confirmed that Mr. Rolax was the man who was photographed with his hands against a wall as a grinning Mrs. Whitman patted him down during a drug sweep in 1996. The Star-Ledger reported last week that Mr. Rolax was the man in the photograph.</p>
        <p>The court agreed in an order filed July 7 to hear Mr. Rolax's appeal of a 1997 sentence, Mr. Wixted said. Mr. Rolax is serving a four-year sentence at the Mountainview Youth Correctional Facility in Annandale, N.J. The Associated Press reported yesterday that the court agreed to determine whether Mr. Rolax's term was consistent with certain sentencing guidelines. Anticipating leniency as part of a plea agreement, Mr. Rolax pleaded guilty to two drug charges in 1997, but he received a harsher sentence when he failed to show up for sentencing.</p>
        <p>The incidents involving Mr. Rolax intersect in other ways: Chief Justice Deborah T. Poritz, who will preside over the appeal, and one of the judges, Justice Peter G. Verniero,  have been accused by the former state police commander, Carl Williams, of accompanying the governor on the drug sweep the night the photograph was taken.</p>
        <p>The justices deny the allegation, said Winnie Comfort, a spokeswoman for the court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verniero has recused himself from the case because he wrote the sentencing guidelines in question while serving as state attorney general.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wixted declined to comment on the photograph. He said he was not preparing a lawsuit against the governor and was not aware of anyone who was. ''We've been rather closed-mouthed about it because what we're interested in is serving his interests and not anyone else's agenda,'' he said.</p>
