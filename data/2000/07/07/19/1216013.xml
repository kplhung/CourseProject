        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was pleased to read (news article, July 13) that a federal judge had ordered Iran to pay $327 million to the Eisenfeld and Duker families for the murder of their children in a 1996 terrorist bombing in Israel. However, I am concerned by the reported efforts of the State Department and the Clinton administration to block the seizure of Iranian assets and thereby block payment.</p>

        <p>I was pleased to read (news article, July 13) that a federal judge had ordered Iran to pay $327 million to the Eisenfeld and Duker families for the murder of their children in a 1996 terrorist bombing in Israel.

        <p>I understand the government's sensitivity that negotiations with countries should not take place in the courtroom. But if the government would allow the court decisions against terrorist groups to be enacted, then a precedent would be set. It would mean that terrorist groups would know that these court penalties are not negotiable.</p>
        <p>The State Department should not have the right to block these court decisions on its own. There needs to be a larger Congressional debate.</p>
