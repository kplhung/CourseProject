        <p>Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrilla organization that forced Israel from the slice of southern Lebanon it had occupied for 22 years, grew from a small band of amateurish gunmen to a highly sophisticated tactical operation savvy enough to exploit a new weapon of modern warfare -- television.</p>
        <p>''The use of media as a weapon had an effect parallel to a battle,'' the top Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, Sheik Nabil Qaouk, said in a rare interview with a Western journalist. He discussed in unusual detail how Hezbollah learned to improve its effectiveness, strategy and weaponry, and how to videotape its successes for distribution to the media.</p>
        <p>''By the use of these films, we were able to control from a long distance the morale of a lot of Israelis,'' he said, underscoring how demoralization as much as defeat helped to drive the Israelis from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>From once relying on teenage suicide bombers to crash cars into Israeli installations in the mid-1980's, Hezbollah tactics -- primarily ambushes, assassinations and roadside bombs -- became increasingly well planned and executed, military observers in the region say.</p>
        <p>A turning point came three years ago this month with the ambush of a raid by elite Israeli naval commandos in which a dozen were killed. The Israelis halted such raids for more than a year, trying to find out what went wrong, and then Hezbollah put out word that it had penetrated Israeli intelligence, the sheik and Western military observers said, further halting Israeli counterinsurgency operations. The effect was to  drive the Israelis into bunkers, conceding land and initiative to Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>And the impact of their strikes was amplified by the fact that they were videotaped by hidden Hezbollah cameramen and that the tape quickly found its way onto Israeli television, sometimes even as the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman denied the incident had taken place.</p>
        <p>The effect was what the military calls a ''force multiplier,'' greatly undermining Israeli will.</p>
        <p>''Seventy-five percent of Hezbollah's war was the videotapes,'' said an experienced official with the United Nations peacekeeping troops in the area.</p>
        <p>The videotapes were rushed to Beirut, where copies were delivered to Lebanese television and Western news agencies like The Associated Press and Reuters, which made them widely available. They were, however, first shown on Hezbollah's own television station.</p>
        <p>The videos were often shown on the nightly television news in Israel, helping bring home the cost of the occupation. They were a stark contrast to the standard fare served up by Israeli military reporters, whose coverage was severely restricted and censored by the army. Blurred and grainy as they sometimes were, the Hezbollah videos contributed to the rising public pressure in Israel to bring the troops home.</p>
        <p>But the tape would not have been taken at all without the improved intelligence gathering and combat skills Hezbollah developed over the years.</p>
        <p>''When they first started, they thought they could do it with a bunch of people on a hill yelling 'Allah-u akbar,' '' a United Nations official in the area said of the Hezbollah fighters. ''They would lose 40 in an operation. Now they are very sophisticated, very disciplined.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Sheik Qauok said the guerrillas had been able to improve their effectiveness by studying each operation, learning from their mistakes and developing new uses for weaponry. He also outlined their reliance on sometimes stunningly low-tech methods to thwart Israel's more numerous and more sophisticated forces.</p>
        <p>''The resistance always focused on the weak points of the enemy,'' he said as he outlined a classic theory and practice of guerrilla warfare.</p>
        <p>Military experts say that at any one time Hezbollah maintained only about 500 full-time fighters, although it could mobilize many more supporters. The Israeli troops in southern Lebanon usually numbered about 1,500, backed up by 2,500 more troops in their proxy Lebanese militia, which collapsed and fled when the Israelis abruptly pulled out of southern Lebanon on May 24.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah officials say they lost  1,200 fighters over the years, and yellow roadside markers are being put up at the spots where they fell. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers were also killed.</p>
        <p>There were two kinds of wars, Sheik Qaouk said, guerrilla war and conventional war. By alternating tactics, he went on, Hezbollah was able to maintain the initiative and, after a clash, melt away into a largely sympathetic populace.</p>
        <p>''By limiting the firing, we were able to keep the cards in our hands,'' the sheik said. ''We were able to do small, little battles where we had the advantage.</p>
        <p>''Even the rockets the resistance used had to be used intelligently. We would do an action only in the time and place where it had an impact.''</p>
        <p>The sheik and other military observers cited a number of Hezbollah innovations. These ranged from roadside bombs made of fake plastic rocks, which could be bought in Beirut garden stores for $15, to running farm animals across areas monitored by Israeli motion sensors. At the same time, Hezbollah had the ability to jam Israeli radar and  closed-circuit television monitors.</p>
        <p>Since it was never driven and did not show up on Israeli heat sensors, an old Soviet T-55 tank hidden in a cave and fired sporadically took the Israelis months to find, the sheik said. Hezbollah fighters discovered that wire-guided antitank rockets, which can, in effect, be steered in flight, could be directed into small openings in concrete bunkers.</p>
        <p>''Even the man who invented these rockets did not know this,'' Sheik Qaouk bragged. The sheik smilingly refused to say if they had American-made TOW missles, more accurate than the old Saggars they had been using. Word on the street, when the tactics changed early this year, was that the TOW missles were given to Hezbollah from Iran, which got them from Israel as part of President Reagan's Iran-Contra-hostage deal.</p>
        <p>Above all, the sheik said, he and his fighters ''were always ready for martyrdom,'' but the Israeli soldier ''probably wasn't ready to die for this.''</p>
        <p>''More important than everything,'' he said, ''is that the Israeli soldier didn't believe in the war.''</p>
        <p>He also stressed the importance of a good intelligence network. The effectiveness of that network was demonstrated with the assassination on Feb. 28 last year of Brig. Gen. Eretz Gerstien, the top Israeli Army liaison officer to the proxy militia, known as the South Lebanon Army, by a roadside bomb as his car passed in a military convoy. He was the highest-ranking Israeli officer killed during the occupation.</p>
        <p>Similarly, last Jan. 30, the militia's second-ranking commander, Col. Akl Hashem, was killed by a bomb at his house in Merj 'Uyun, a mainly Christian community.</p>
