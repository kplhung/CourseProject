        <p>The Chechen leaders appointed by Moscow are supposed to help the Kremlin tighten its grip on the breakaway region. But today they quarreled bitterly among themselves and even engaged in a dangerous round of saber-rattling.</p>
        <p>The confrontation, which occurred in Gudermes, the region's administrative capital and second-largest city, underscores the difficulties Russia has encountered in establishing a Chechen government that has the support of the Chechen people.</p>
        <p>It was an embarrassment to President Vladimir V. Putin. He met with the Chechen leaders at the air base in Mozdok, a few miles outside Chechnya, just two weeks ago and urged that pro-Moscow Chechen forces play more of a role in bringing order to the region, where Russian troops have been fighting Chechen rebels since September.</p>
        <p>The episode began when Bislan Gantamirov, a pro-Moscow leader of a Chechen paramilitary unit, sent 200 of his men into Gudermes, ostensibly to search for rebels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gantamirov, a former mayor of the Chechen capital, Grozny, was imprisoned for embezzlement before the current military campaign in Chechnya. But he was released so that he could fight on the Russian side.</p>
        <p>Recently the Russians appointed him deputy administrator in their new Chechen government and gave him responsibility for security as part of Moscow's effort to contend with the rebels' attacks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gantamirov has been a bitter rival of Akhmad Kadyrov, the Russian-appointed administrator of Chechnya, who is based in Gudermes. And Mr. Gantamirov's operation in Gudermes today was widely seen as an attempt to intimidate Mr. Kadyrov.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov, a former Muslim religious leader, opposed the Russians during the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, when Russian troops trying to break a drive for Chechen independence were driven out. But he has cooperated with Moscow since Russian troops returned last fall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadyrov has been the target of several assassination attacks and has been struggling to establish his authority in Chechnya since his appointment last month.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was Mr. Kadyrov's decision to dismiss several local officials, including some apparently loyal to Mr. Gantamirov, that prompted Mr. Gantamirov to send his men to Gudermes. ''We are the people who fought our way from the border with Ingushetia to Grozny, and we won't be bossed around by Kadyrov and his gang,'' Mr. Gantamirov said.</p>
        <p>As tensions grew, Mr. Kadyrov made it clear that he did not welcome Mr. Gatamirov's troops and had certainly never endorsed their mission to sweep the city.</p>
        <p>The Russian military became concerned too. Russia's armed forces are tied down coping with the rebels' guerrilla tactics. The last thing they needed was a clash among their own allies. So Lt. Gen. Ivan Babichev quickly moved to keep order. The Russians said that Mr. Gantamirov and Mr. Kadyrov would meet to try to resolve their differences.</p>
        <p>To avoid a firefight, Mr. Gantamirov's men were allowed to pass through the checkpoints on the outskirts of Gudermes. But General Babichev later warned Mr. Gantamirov's militia to leave Gudermes and suggested that they would be fired on if they did not.</p>
        <p>This is not the only time that the performance of the pro-Moscow Chechen military has come under question. Russian soldiers say Mr. Ganatmirov has vastly exaggerated the importance of his unit in the capture of Grozny.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gantamirov and his men were discharged from their duties by the Russian authorities this spring after the Russians complained that the Chechen militia had failed to carry out its responsibilities and had disappeared along with their weapons. But Mr. Gantamirov was recently hired after the rebels unleashed a wave of bombings and stepped up their guerrilla attacks.</p>
        <p>Col. Gen. Gennadi N. Troshev, the senior Russian commander in Chechnya, has also pointed to problems Moscow has had with pro-Moscow Chechens, though he did not blame the men under Mr. Gantamirov's command.</p>
        <p>According to General Troshev, a Chechen militia unit recently captured Shirvani Basayev, the brother of Shamil Basayev, the Chechen guerrilla leader. Apparently fearful that the detention would subject them to reprisals, the militia let him go.</p>
