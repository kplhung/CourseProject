        <p>A Grande Dame Is Remembered</p>
        <p>The actress DIANA RIGG sent a message from London describing her as a friend of three decades and her ''touchstone'' in New York, the first person she got in touch with when she visited America. The mezzo-soprano REGINA RESNIK sent a message from Venice.</p>
        <p>The memorial tribute to ANNA SOSENKO, a songwriter and impresario who died last month at 90, was organized by three of her longtime friends: BARBARA TAYLOR BRADFORD, an author; FRAN WEISSLER, a Broadway producer; and PAULINE TRIGERE, a designer.</p>
        <p>Among the 30 guests who gathered in Mrs. Bradford's Manhattan apartment on Monday night were the actress RENEE TAYLOR; FLORIA LASKY, a theatrical lawyer; ANITA WAXMAN, a producer; and DONALD SADDLER, the choreographer and White Barn theater impresario. Tears washed Ms. Taylor's face as she spoke but she grinned through them. ''I like crying,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A number of guests commented on her ability to surmount the generational gap, but it was DR. KEVIN O'FLAHERTY, Ms. Sosenko's audiologist and friend, who had the last word. He recalled driving Ms. Sosenko home from a social event shortly before she died. As they approached her building she instructed him to ''drive around the block and pull into that dark spot.'' He followed orders (as did most of her friends) and was then told to ''take off your seat belt and lean toward me.''</p>
        <p>He said he sat there, stunned. ''I'll bet a woman my age never asked you to do this,'' she told him.</p>
        <p>He was speechless.</p>
        <p>''Check my ears,'' she ordered, and bellowed with laughter.</p>
        <p>Floating Ad Game With a History</p>
        <p>About that New York City building inspector who was ferried across the Hudson River on a police boat to issue a notice against the Web site Dirtpile.com for violating the municipal prohibition against floating billboards:</p>
        <p>Who knew there was such a rule?</p>
        <p>As it turns out, LLOYD KAPLAN, of the public relations firm Linden Alschuler &amp; Kaplan. In the early 1960's, when he was the spokesman for the City Planning Department, Mr. Kaplan fielded a call from a newspaper reporter who had noticed a barge-mounted billboard on the East River.</p>
        <p>''What are you guys going to do about it?'' the reporter demanded.</p>
        <p>''My first thought was torpedoes,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''My second thought was zoning. It struck me as something someone ought to be doing something about, and I was embarrassed that I didn't have an answer. I called the Coast Guard to see whether they knew about it, did they have any issues, and their concern was with the seaworthiness of vessels. They had no way of enforcing anything about content on vessels.''</p>
        <p>But signs that might endanger the safety of landlubbers -- specifically, motorists, because who else reads signs best seen from the highways around the edges of Manhattan? -- appeared to fall under the planning agency's jurisdiction. So Mr. Kaplan said that he and NORMAN MARCUS, the counsel to the planning agency at the time, began preparing a ban.</p>
        <p>It was, Mr. Kaplan recalls, Mr. Marcus's first effort at drafting the language for a zoning amendment, and choosing a verb for the new regulation turned out to be crucial. He and Mr. Marcus settled on ''plying.''</p>
        <p>''That was Norman's word,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''He was trying to find a word that would have resonance legally. 'Sailing' wasn't quite the right word. 'Moving' wasn't quite the right word. 'Towing' didn't cover all manner of vessel momentum. And as for 'anchoring,' I suppose if somebody anchored something out there and it never moved, you'd have to go back and amend the amendment.''</p>
        <p>Facing tough opposition at the Board of Estimate, Mr. Kaplan reached out to the advertising giant DAVID OGILVY and told him about floating billboards. ''Without reservation, he said, 'It's a terrible idea,' '' Mr. Kaplan said, adding that Mr. Ogilvy's testimony to that effect helped carry the day at the Board of Estimate, which passed the rule.</p>
