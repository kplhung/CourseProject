        <p>Despite continuing efforts to bring in truant students, attendance fell further this week in New York City's summer school program. Officials said yesterday that the decline had occurred mainly among high school students.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who released the latest figures while touring an elementary school in the Bronx, said that attendance had risen slightly in elementary and middle schools. He attributed the increase to aggressive efforts to call parents and visit the homes of missing students.</p>
        <p>But he conceded that, overall, there were fewer students in summer school this week than last.</p>
        <p>''In my judgment, that's the wrong direction,'' Mr. Levy said. With obvious frustration, he added, ''Short of handcuffing children to the desk, I'm not sure what to do.''</p>
        <p>The abysmal attendance among high school students, which dropped to 50 percent this week from 54 percent last week, illustrates a persistent problem: the huge failure rate when children reach ninth grade. It is, school officials say, one reason that the Board of Education has embarked on its ambitious program to end automatic promotion of failing students in lower grades, before they fall so far behind that they are doomed to failure in high school.</p>
        <p>The news was better in elementary school, where of those required to attend or be held back, 79 percent were attending yesterday, up from 76 percent a week ago. Among the voluntary students, who were urged to go but will be promoted anyway, 71 percent were attending, up from 65 percent a week ago.</p>
        <p>But the continued low attendance and the problems in high school in particular point up how difficult it is to raise standards for children even when all the logistics, from food to transportation to enough teachers, seem to have been worked out.</p>
        <p>Nearly 60 percent -- 155,000 out of 260,000 -- of the city's high school students have registered for the summer program, most of them because they failed one or more courses or failed a Regents examination required for graduation.</p>
        <p>Officials attributed the no-shows among them to the knowledge that they will not necessarily be held back if they skip summer school. Students can be promoted to the next grade if they fail a course or a Regents exam, as long as they make it up later.</p>
        <p>''High school really is a totally separate animal,'' said Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for Mr. Levy. ''If you don't go to summer school, it's not like you have to repeat your entire sophomore year. You just flunk the course and have to take it at a later date.''</p>
        <p>Because of the high expectations surrounding summer school, it has become a test of Mr. Levy's management ability after just six months on the job, even though he inherited the program from his predecessor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy has set up a computerized attendance-tracking system to avoid the debacle of last year, when Rudy Crew, then the chancellor, did not learn until the summer was over that 25 percent of the students required to attend had never bothered to show up.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy is in a vulnerable position, as it becomes clear that ordering students to go to summer school does not mean that they will actually attend.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, Levy is getting hung because he is trying to be responsible about collecting data,'' said Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Levy tried to keep track of attendance to the nearest decimal point, the base numbers continued to shift, down to 324,000 yesterday from 327,000 last week. Yesterday morning, at Public School 109 in the Bronx, Mr. Levy put the overall attendance, high school as well as lower grades, at 57 percent, down from 62 percent a week ago. But in the afternoon, after officials removied from attendance rolls the students whose parents had formally notified the Board of Education they would not be coming, the number was revised to 62 percent.</p>
