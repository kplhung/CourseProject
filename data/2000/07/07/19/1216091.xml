        <p>The United States attorney's office is investigating the fatal shooting of a Jersey City teenager by a police officer in January, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Michael Anglin, 15, died of a single gunshot wound just above his right ear on Jan. 28, after a stolen van in which he was riding crashed after a chase by Jersey City police officers.</p>
        <p>In May, a Hudson County grand jury declined to indict Officer Vincent Corso. The Hudson County prosecutor, Frederick J. Theemling Jr., who presented the case, said the panel determined that the boy had been shot accidentally during a struggle with Officer Corso.</p>
        <p>The boy's parents, Michael and Rosalee Anglin, today gathered with  several supporters outside the county prosecutor's office here to criticize what they said was a biased presentation by Mr. Theemling to the grand jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Theemling said he agreed with the grand jury's findings, but he denied having any bias and said he welcomed the involvement of Robert J. Cleary, the United States attorney for New Jersey. Mr. Theemling said he turned over case records last month to Mr. Cleary's office.</p>
        <p>Testimony varied on how the struggle began, but Mr. Theemling said it appeared that Officer Corso had trouble forcing the boy to the ground to handcuff him. Mr. Theem ling said an autopsy found that the gun was directly against the boy's head when it was fired.</p>
        <p>Last month the family notified the Jersey City Police Department of its intention to file a lawsuit.</p>
