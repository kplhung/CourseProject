        <p>BBC America, the United States division of the British Broadcasting Company, is to announce today that it has closed distribution deals with two major cable companies that should significantly boost its presence in the states.</p>
        <p>Time Warner Cable, the second largest cable provider, and Comcast, the third largest cable provider, have both agreed to carry the channel on their new digital services. BBC America is currently available in only 13 million homes, most of which subscribe to satellite television providers.</p>
        <p>Executives with the network said that as those new digital cable services were made available over the next three years, BBC America would become available in 30 million homes -- or 30 percent of the country's television households -- which should be nearly enough to qualify it to be rated by Nielsen Media Research.</p>
        <p>BBC America offers the more popular British series -- like ''Absolutely Fabulous'' and ''Monty Python'' -- as well as news from abroad.</p>
        <p>The growth of BBC America comes as British producers are making huge inroads in broadcast television with exported hits like ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and ''Survivor.''</p>
