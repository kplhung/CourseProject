        <p>Editorial scores Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule change in Clean Water Act to allow environmentally destructive practice called mountaintop-removal mining, common in coal-bearing regions of Southeast, to continue unimpeded; notes opponents fear proposal would expose waters across United States to dumping of waste</p>

        <p>Today is the final day for public comment on a proposed rule change in the Clean Water Act that would allow the environmentally destructive practice called mountaintop-removal mining, common in the coal-bearing regions of the Southeast, to continue unimpeded. In mountaintop-removal mining, the soil and rock above a coal seam are dumped into hollows and streambeds.</p>
        <p>Last October a federal judge in West Virginia ruled that the practice violated the Clean Water Act, which says that mining and other wastes cannot be used as ''fill material'' in waterways. Instead of defending the law, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to change the definition of ''fill material'' to eliminate that part of the rule barring the use of waste. This in effect gives the Army Corps of Engineers, which issues fill permits under the Clean Water Act, the authority to bury streams and estuaries with waste.</p>

        <p>Today is the final day for public comment on a proposed rule change in the Clean Water Act that would allow the environmentally destructive practice called mountaintop-removal mining, common in the coal-bearing regions of the Southeast, to continue unimpeded. In mountaintop-removal mining, the soil and rock above a coal seam are dumped into hollows and streambeds.</p>
        <p>Last October a federal judge in West Virginia ruled that the practice violated the Clean Water Act, which says that mining and other wastes cannot be used as ''fill material'' in waterways. Instead of defending the law, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to change the definition of ''fill material'' to eliminate that part of the rule barring the use of waste. This in effect gives the Army Corps of Engineers, which issues fill permits under the Clean Water Act, the authority to bury streams and estuaries with waste.</p>
        <p>The change is opposed by environmentalists and moderate Republicans, including Rick Lazio, who are furious at the administration for weakening its generally reliable support of the Clean Water Act. Through an aide, Hillary Clinton, Mr. Lazio's opponent in the New York Senate race, has said that she too opposes the change in environmental rules. She and Mr. Lazio contest the change not because they need to take a stand on mountaintop mining in West Virginia, but because it would expose waters all across the United States to the dumping of waste. The E.P.A. argues that by altering the definition of ''fill'' to include waste it is merely legalizing current practice in the coal mining industry. But the better way to make coal mining conform with the law is to leave the law alone and end mountaintop removal, which has destroyed 1,000 miles of streams in West Virginia alone.</p>
        <p>The administration's stand can be understood only in the narrowest political sense. Mining that dumps waste into hollows and valleys has expanded considerably during the past 10 years, and one of the states in which it is most prevalent -- West Virginia -- is represented by the powerful and agelessly influential Democratic senator Robert Byrd. But by pursuing this rule change -- by authorizing the dumping of waste into living waters -- the administration has involved itself in a fatal contradiction, claiming to support the Clean Water Act while also undercutting it. What the act needs is not revision. It is enforcement.</p>
