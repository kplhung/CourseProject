        <p>A tourist walking in Midtown suffered a fractured skull yesterday when a 25-pound stucco ornament  loosened and fell 14 stories, knocking him unconscious in front of his wife and children.</p>
        <p>Two other people suffered minor injuries from flying debris in the incident at Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street. Emergency workers closed off the intersection and evacuated three restaurants on the ground floor, and the authorities ordered the owner of the building to put up a protective shed.</p>
        <p>The seriously injured man, John Edwards, 37, from Pennsylvania, was attending a six-day religious conference, ''Changing Your World,'' at Madison Square Garden with his wife and two children. Last night, in a room where prayer meetings and faith healings were to take place, participants prayed for Mr. Edwards as he was about to undergo a three- to four-hour brain operation at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was expected to recover, said John Clarke, a hospital spokesman.</p>
        <p>A witness to the incident said the Edwards family was on a dinner break from the conference about 4:45 p.m. when the ornament, a half-medallion with a rising sun motif, fell  from the commercial building and  crashed onto a crowded sidewalk. Mr. Edwards's wife and a handful of other people prayed at his side, said the witness, Claudette Wilson. Ms. Wilson said Mr. Edwards had a large, deep cut across the top of his head. ''There was blood everywhere,'' she said. ''They had to get sheets and towels to stop it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson, who was also attending the conference given by the Creflo Dollar Ministry of Atlanta, said she was walking with the Edwards family and felt shards of concrete hit her when the ornament fell.</p>
        <p>The police said that Torruella Rosa, 32, suffered a minor injury to her right leg and refused medical attention, and that Nakeigha Henderson, 27, was treated at Bellevue for minor injuries and released. The police did not know where they were from or if they, too, were attending the conference. The conference attracted more than 4,000 people, said  Paul Harris, a spokesman for the ministry.</p>
        <p>The police said the fallen ornament was 4 feet long and 6 feet wide, about 2 inches thick, and weighed about 25 pounds. It had become waterlogged and loosened over time, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>After the incident, the sidewalk was littered with debris and a white sheet covered with blood. Firefighters and Buildings Department inspectors examined the facade and found other areas that needed repair, said Deputy Chief Frank Fellini, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>The New York Transit Authority was asked to slow trains on the nearby 1, 2, 3, and 9 subway lines to reduce vibrations until the building could be secured, Chief Fellini said.</p>
        <p>He said the Buildings Department had ordered a building representative to put up a ''sidewalk shed'' to shield pedestrians and to cover the building with protective netting. Both were expected to be in place before midnight, he said.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a Buildings Department spokesman, said the department would investigate whether the building's owners should be cited. He said facades were regularly inspected, but the length of time between inspections depended on the building's history. He could not say last night when the building was last inspected or when it was built.</p>
        <p>Gary Gumowitz, a tenant and the son of one of the building's owners, Arnold Gumowitz, said that it was well maintained, and that he had heard that heavy wind might have dislodged the ornament. ''It's awful,'' Gary Gumowitz said. ''My condolences go to the family. I don't know what to say. I just feel terrible.''</p>
