        <p>TACO BELL, the fast-food chain specializing in Mexican style meals, is suddenly saying adios to TBWA/Chiat/Day, the agency that created the company's popular talking Chihuahua character.</p>
        <p>Taco Bell, based in Irvine, Calif., said yesterday that it would dismiss TBWA/Chiat/Day after three years of producing national advertising campaigns and consolidate its account, for now, at FCB Worldwide, an agency that has handled other duties. The billings for the entire account were estimated at more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>The dismissal of the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/ Day came with the abrupt simultaneous departure of Peter Waller, who as Taco Bell's president headed its marketing efforts. The changes reflect the intensifying competition in the fast-food industry as marketers jostle one another for what they call share of stomach.</p>
        <p>''It's increasingly difficult for the 'quick service' players to show the kinds of gains they enjoyed in the past,'' said Ron Paul, president of Technomic in Chicago, a restaurant consulting company, ''and somebody has to be blamed.''</p>
        <p>''It's not shoot the messenger,'' he added, ''it's shoot the agency.''</p>
        <p>Despite widespread acclaim for the canine character, which talked thanks to computer-generated effects, Taco Bell's sales had stagnated recently. The dog's role was played down in current commercials that played up the quality of the chain's food instead.</p>
        <p>''That's not what we wanted to do,'' said Tom Carroll, president and chief executive at the TBWA/Chiat/ Day office, adding that the dog, which uttered expressions like ''Yo quiero (I want) Taco Bell,'' has been ''one of the best advertising icons in recent memory, which helped Taco Bell with the younger consumers who eat fast food most.''</p>
        <p>''When we did the advertising we felt we should do and had the product, we sold product,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''The business isn't doing well and we're one of the victims.''</p>
        <p>The dismissal of TBWA/Chiat/ Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, was not entirely unexpected. The trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek reported this week that Taco Bell had awarded an undisclosed national assignment to the FCB unit known as FCB Southern California, based in Costa Mesa, which handles assignments like media buying and field marketing.</p>
        <p>FCB Southern California had created national campaigns for Taco Bell, carrying themes like ''Run for the border,'' until 1994, when it lost that assignment to Bozell Worldwide in Costa Mesa and the Richards Group in Dallas. TBWA/Chiat/Day succeeded them in March 1997.</p>
        <p>''FCB is a creative powerhouse'' that ''understands our business,'' said David Novak, chief executive at Tricon Global Restaurants in Louisville, Ky., which owns Taco Bell along with KFC and Pizza Hut.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Novak praised FCB, which created Taco Bell ads during the chain's largest sustained sales gains in the 1980's and early 90's, as ''committed to driving our same-store sales growth with compelling advertising.'' He also outlined the ''immediate challenge'' that faces FCB: to ''give us a fresh creative approach to help improve sales trends.''</p>
        <p>FCB will handle all aspects of the Taco Bell account, Mr. Novak said, until Mr. Waller's successor, Emil Brolick, determines whether the agency will keep the creative duties or whether they will be placed in review. Mr. Brolick is joining Taco Bell, with the title president and chief concept officer, from Wendy's International in Dublin, Ohio, where he had most recently been senior vice president for new product marketing, research and strategic planning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Novak said in his statement that he and Mr. Waller had ''mutually agreed it is an appropriate time at Taco Bell to bring in a new, outside perspective, both in terms of new management leadership and advertising support.''</p>
        <p>Brendan Ryan, chief executive in New York at FCB, part of True North Communications, said he would disagree with an assessment that FCB has a lock on the national creative assignment, as Mr. Brolick considers his next moves.</p>
        <p>''It's a great opportunity for us,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''but new clients or old clients, if you don't come through and drive sales, you're going to be in trouble.''</p>
        <p>''We've got to come through,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The loss of the Taco Bell assignment is a blow to TBWA/Chiat/Day, which is known for creating characters that entertain consumers as they peddle products.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the agency, creations like the Taco Bell Chihuahua and Mr. K, the smiling mascot for Nissan cars and trucks, have been deemed more effective at generating smiles than at selling burritos or sedans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Carroll disagreed, saying: ''It's an old rap that just doesn't hold water. It's product and promotion that drive frequency and loyalty in fast food. It's advertising's job to create a window, and we created a pretty big window.''</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when brands are struggling,'' he added, referring to the recent period when the Chihuahua was de-emphasized in the campaign, ''good things are dismantled.''</p>
        <p>The dog that talked with a sassy attitude and a Mexican accent was introduced by TBWA/Chiat/Day in 1997 as an incidental character in a single commercial. But the idea captured the public's fancy and the the dog began appearing in more spots, then soon became a popular culture phenomenon.</p>
        <p>The dog appeared on the annual ''It List'' of hot trends published by Entertainment Weekly magazine as well as on merchandise like T-shirts and hats. Giveaways of talking Chihuahua dolls were among the most successful Taco Bell promotions.</p>
        <p>Asked what plans FCB might have for the dog, Mr. Ryan said, ''I don't want to go into that.''</p>
