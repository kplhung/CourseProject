        <p>Michael Kaiser, the New York theater and ballet manager who helped rescue Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London from a financial crisis, is about to be named president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a Kennedy Center official said today.</p>

        <p>Michael Kaiser, the New York theater and ballet manager who helped rescue Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London from a financial crisis, is about to be named president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a Kennedy Center official said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, who announced last month that he was returning to the United States, said then that he would leave Covent Garden at the end of the 2000-01 season, but the Kennedy Center official said today that Mr. Kaiser was scheduled to start his duties here on Feb. 1, well before the end of next season.</p>
        <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the appointment is to be announced formally on Wednesday after the center's board formally votes its approval and that Mr. Kaiser would not be available for comment until then.</p>
        <p>As chief executive at at Covent Garden, Mr. Kaiser virtually eliminated the budget deficit and created a permanent endowment. When he announced his resignation he said the decision to quit was ''the most profoundly difficult'' of his career, adding, ''But for personal reasons it is time for me to return to my home.'' After hearing of Mr. Kaiser's decision, Sir Colin Southgate, the Royal Opera House's board chairman, said, ''We owe him a huge debt of gratitude.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser will succeed Lawrence J. Wilker, who announced in April that he would leave his post at the end of the year and, following the path of many other executives these days, would join a new Internet venture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilker's announcement came a week after Nathan Leventhal said he would leave his job as president of Lincoln Center. That created the unusual circumstance of the nation's two leading performing arts centers recruiting chief operating officers at the same time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, the official said, told the search committee, ''I was the world's worst board member because I was meddling all the time, and that's when I realized it was what I wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>After he realized that he wanted to make arts administration his career, Mr. Kaiser sold his business consulting firm and, the Kennedy Center official said, ''started cold at the Kansas City Ballet and worked his way up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser was also executive director at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and American Ballet Theater, helping restore those companies to financial health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiser, 47, told the search committee that he was a lover of the performing arts who was raised in a performing arts family. His grandfather was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic, and one of the earliest memories he has is of spending every Saturday at the orchestra's rehearsals.</p>
        <p>The presidency of the Kennedy Center is the No. 2 post, behind the chairmanship, which puts him in day-to-day charge of the center's operations and performances.</p>
        <p>''It is a demanding job, with 3,300 performances a year,'' said James A. Johnson, chairman of the Kennedy Center, when Mr. Wilker's resignation was announced. ''There are six or seven stages operating in an evening when everything is full.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leventhal's salary at Lincoln Center was $525,000 a year and Mr. Wilker's at the Kennedy Center was $325,000. The Kennedy Center official said that Mr. Kaiser's salary was still being discussed and that it would be competitive with similar positions in the performing arts.</p>
