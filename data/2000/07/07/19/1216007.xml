        <p>IN Provence, lavender weights the summer air with a heady fragrance and splashes across the landscape in thick, undulating rows of vibrant purple. It shares the dry soil and hot sun with better-known herbs -- thyme, rosemary, sage, tarragon and oregano -- but lavender is the star, prized for its bouquet, a clean aroma at once floral and woodsy.</p>
        <p>Lavender is used mostly for its fragrance in Provence. But in New York, far from the capital of this redolent crop, a strange thing happened when farmers started selling lavender. People started cooking with it.</p>
        <p>Lavender is in Greenmarkets and on menus all over the city this summer. Chefs are scattering the tiny flowers over salads and using them to infuse sauces for fish and lamb. They are flavoring ice creams and other desserts with lavender's haunting essence. A cook bold enough to experiment will discover a surprisingly seductive herb.</p>
        <p>''Lavender adds something indescribable to a dish,'' said Debra Ponzek, the owner of Aux Delices, a catering shop in Greenwich, Conn. ''People are more familiar with it as a fragrance than as a taste, but it adds an unusual, soft, flowery essence.''</p>
        <p>Its scent is everywhere, in the cluster of tiny purple flower buds and in slender stems branched with small leaves often resembling spindly rosemary. Lightly crush it and the aroma is yours.</p>
        <p>The aroma drives the flavor. As the 18th-century French gastronome Brillat-Savarin put it, ''Smell and taste form a single sense, of which the mouth is the laboratory and the nose is the chimney.'' Lavender brings this theory to life.</p>
        <p>Just a branch or two used to garnish a poached chicken breast, a round of goat cheese on a salad, or some moist, sliced white nectarines will add a whiff of floral elegance.</p>
        <p>It is a powerful herb and has to be used sparingly in cooking. Too much can overwhelm a dish with a resinous pungency that's almost soapy.</p>
        <p>''You put it in just at the last minute because, like cilantro, you have to be careful not to overdo it,'' said Antoine Bouterin, a native of St. Remy-de-Provence and the owner of Bouterin, on East 59th Street. He uses lavender flowers as a garnish and to enhance the lavender honey in marinades and glazes for duck and chicken.</p>
        <p>It's not clear whether lavender is so prevalent lately because there is more of a supply or more of a demand. Richard Farnabe, the chef at Lotus in the meat-packing district, who once cooked in the South of France, said that he never saw fresh lavender in this country before but that now all his suppliers have it.</p>
        <p>Cristina Spindler, the owner of the Peconic Herb Farm, in Calverton, N.Y., said demand has been ''unbelievable,'' as ''lots of people have discovered it for their gardens because of the fragrance and because it repels insects, and some want to know how to use it for cooking.''</p>
        <p>In the Provencal kitchen, fresh lavender  -- lavandou in the local dialect -- shows up mainly in confectionary or in ice creams and vinegars. With thyme, oregano, savory, rosemary and marjoram, it is often included in the mixture known as herbes de Provence, which adds a distinctive flavor to game birds and lamb. Delicately fragrant lavender honey is used in making nougat.</p>
        <p>New York chefs are using lavender in some traditional ways, in creamy desserts like the lavender panna cotta at Abajour on the Upper East Side and the carmeline, a kind of pastry cream, scented with lavender at Cello, on East 77th Street. Alex Astienza, the pastry chef at Patria in the Flatiron district, sees lavender as a little like cardamom, which also has a perfume-like quality, and combines it with quince in a confit to serve alongside honey ice cream.</p>
        <p>Outside New York, lavender is also having an impact, in creme brulee, for example, at Absinthe in San Francisco and the Jefferson in Washington. Chefs in California, among them Alice Waters and her disciples, have long been partial to it, cutting branches to use as flavoring and garnish. But this is the first time it's been so popular in New York.</p>
        <p>Alex Lee, the executive chef at Daniel, grows five kinds of lavender in his garden in Port Washington, N.Y. He uses it to flavor lamb with pine nuts. At Cafe Boulud, the executive chef, Andrew Carmellini, infuses lavender in broth to flavor an artichoke and goat cheese salad.</p>
        <p>Chefs are also using lavender in more inventive ways, dropping a chic new name on their menus. At Revel, on the Upper East Side, Maurizio Marfoglia glazes fresh sardines with lavender honey and adds a bit of fresh lavender as a garnish. Mr. Farnabe dapples a risotto cake with lavender flowers to serve alongside squab. John Tesar at Vine, in the financial district, scatters lavender and chive flowers on crispy sweetbreads  and pappardelle; he said they cut the richness of the meat.</p>
        <p>Patrick Woodside, the chef at Nicholson, on East 58th Street, adds a whiff of lavender to roasted langoustines by including the flowers in a light accompanying sabayon.  ''I'm familiar with lavender from England,'' said Mr. Woodside, who previously worked at the Connaught Hotel in London. ''I haven't seen it so much here, so I thought, Why not use it?''</p>
        <p>Fresh figs do well roasted with lavender honey, then strewn with lavender buds. Terrance Brennan of Picholine, near Lincoln Center, adds figs and lavender to his Cavaillon melon soup.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ponzek, at Aux Delices, infuses milk with lavender to fold into cake batter. She also adds it to her own herbes de Provence blend and makes a lavender syrup, which she bottles and sells. ''The syrup is great as a finish for a kir royale,'' Ms. Ponzek said.</p>
        <p>When making an infusion or syrup for ice cream or sorbet with the flowers, it's important to strain them out, because they will turn the mixture an unpleasant gray if left in longer than about a day. The only way to obtain a lavender color for ice cream or sorbet is to add an ingredient like grape juice, blueberry puree or food coloring.</p>
        <p>For syrups as well as ice creams and sorbets, Ms. Spindler, the herb farmer, suggested using hybrid varieties from Provence, like Lavandula grosso and Lavandula intermedia, which she said are finer than the popular French hybrid lavandin.</p>
        <p>Munstead, which sports particularly attractive flower buds, and Hidcote, which has especially dark purple flowers and intense flavor, are the English kinds most widely available. In a couple of weeks, Stokes Farm in Old Tappan, N.J., which grows lavandin, will also have bunches of Hidcote and Munstead at the Union Square Greenmarket.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of varieties of lavender. Peconic River Herb Farm sells 18 kinds. All are edible, Ms. Spindler said, but the hardy varieties are best because they have better flavor. They are often identified as perennials, and their flowers have the sweetest and most pronounced aroma.</p>
        <p>If you buy it in pots and want to cook with it, look for French hybrid lavender or English Hidcote and Munstead. Dried lavender intended for potpourri or sachets should never be used in cooking. It may have had perfume added to it. Fresh lavender at a florist may also have been treated to make it nonedible.</p>
        <p>Right now, the Greenmarkets are the best source for lavender, and they are selling bunches for $1 to $3. Most recipes do not require more than a few sprigs.</p>
        <p>Like cut flowers, fresh lavender is best kept in water. It should be used within a day or it will begin to wilt. Any you cannot use you can hang up in an airy spot to dry.</p>
        <p>Dried lavender should be added in somewhat smaller quantities than fresh, because it tends to be stronger. It is sold at spice markets like Adriana's Caravan in the Grand Central Market and at Aphrodisia in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>For all its brilliant allure, lavender should add no more than an elusive, fragrant je ne sais quoi.</p>
        <p>LAVENDER ICE CREAM  Adapted from Capsouto Freres  Time: 45 minutes, plus chilling and freezing</p>
        <p>4 fresh or dried lavender flowers  1 cup milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  6 egg yolks, lightly beaten</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream</p>

        <p>1. Place lavender and milk in small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, remove from heat and allow to rest for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Whisk sugar and egg yolks together in heavy saucepan or top of double boiler. Whisk in lavender-infused milk and the cream. Cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat, or over water in double boiler, until thickened. Take care not to let simmer or eggs will curdle. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer to metal bowl and refrigerate until cold. Strain to remove lavender. Fold in creme fraiche, blueberry puree and vanilla. Place in ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer's directions. Serve at once or place in container and freeze until firm. Use within 2 days.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 pint.</p>
        <p>LAVENDER-CAVAILLON MELON SOUP  Adapted from Picholine  Time: 45 minutes, plus chilling</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  12 branches fresh lavender, with flowers  2 cups gruner veltliner or dry muscat wine  4 Cavaillon melons (or 1 very large or 2 medium cantaloupes)  2 tablespoons fresh orange juice  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</p>
        <p>Pinch salt  6 fresh figs, quartered  6 scoops cantaloupe or orange sorbet, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Place sugar in saucepan and stir in  3/4 cup water. Add 6 branches lavender. Simmer until sugar dissolves. Place saucepan in bowl of ice water to chill. Strain when cool.</p>
        <p>2. Place wine in saucepan and cook until reduced to 1 cup. Chill.</p>
        <p>3. Remove skin and seeds from melons. Cut enough of the flesh in  1/2-inch dice to make 1 1/2 cups. Refrigerate. Chop remaining melon and puree in food processor to yield 4 cups.</p>
        <p>4. Add wine, orange juice, lemon juice and lime juice to melon puree. Stir in  1/2 cup lavender syrup. Add salt. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, fold remaining lavender syrup into diced melon and place a mound of melon in center of each of 6 chilled shallow soup plates. Add figs. Spoon melon soup around. Top each portion, if desired, with sorbet. Garnish with a branch of lavender and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>ARTICHOKE SALAD WITH LAVENDER AND GOAT CHEESE  Adapted from Cafe Boulud  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>4 large artichokes  Juice of 1 lemon  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed  1 sprig rosemary  1 sprig thyme  1 bay leaf  10 branches lavender, with flowers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dry white wine  1 1/2 cups chicken stock  5 ounces soft fresh goat cheese  1 tablespoon heavy cream  1 tablespoon finely minced shallot  1 teaspoon sherry vinegar  1 tablespoon finely minced herbs (tarragon, chives, chervil)  1 large egg yolk</p>
        <p>1/4 cup grapeseed oil  1 bunch frisee lettuce or 2 bunches mache, trimmed, rinsed and dried.</p>
        <p>1. Remove outer green leaves from artichokes and cut off stems. With a paring knife, trim away remaining leaves and inner fuzz so only fleshy heart remains. Quarter hearts. Place in bowl of water with  1/2 tablespoon lemon juice.</p>
        <p>2. Gently heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in saucepan. Add garlic, cook briefly and add drained artichoke hearts, rosemary, thyme, bay leaf and 3 branches lavender. Season with salt and pepper. Add wine. Reduce by half. Add chicken stock. Simmer until artichokes are tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p>3. Mash goat cheese with cream. Fold in shallot, vinegar, minced herbs and leaves from 3 branches of lavender. Reserve flowers. Season cheese with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Strain artichokes, reserving liquid. Place egg yolk in bowl. Whisk in 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Slowly add grapeseed oil and remaining olive oil in thin stream, whisking constantly, to emulsify. Stir in remaining lemon juice and  1/4 cup poaching liquid. (Save remaining liquid for another use, like soup.) Season with salt and pepper. Use about half this dressing to toss with frisee or mache.</p>
        <p>5. Cut each artichoke quarter in 4 pieces,  and arrange in a circle on each of 4 salad plates. Place goat cheese in middle. Place some greens to one side. Drizzle remaining dressing over artichokes. Pluck lavender flowers from stem and scatter on top; garnish each plate with a lavender branch.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>GRILLED QUAIL WITH LAVENDER ONIONS  Time: 1 1/2 hours, including marinating</p>
        <p>1 bottle rose wine  2 tablespoons honey, preferably lavender  1 1/2 tablespoons orange zest  1 large clove garlic, crushed  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  4 branches fresh lavender (flowers and leaves), plus 1 teaspoon lavender flowers  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  8 quail, butterflied  1 pound pearl onions  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 tablespoon red wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>1. Reserve 1 cup wine. Place rest in a saucepan, and simmer until wine is reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Add 1 tablespoon honey, 1 tablespoon orange zest, garlic, oil and lavender branches. Set aside until cool, then strain. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Place wine mixture in large bowl, add quail and marinate one hour.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, place onions in saucepan with water to cover. Simmer 3 minutes. Drain and cut off root ends and peel.</p>
        <p>4. Heat butter in medium-size skillet. Add onions, remaining honey and vinegar. Cook over medium-high heat until onions start to brown. Add remaining wine and orange zest. Continue simmering, about 10 minutes, until liquid has reduced somewhat and is syrupy, but with still plenty to coat onions. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
        <p>5. Heat grill or broiler. Grill or broil quail 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until just cooked through and still slightly pink. Add any pan juices to onions. Briefly reheat onion mixture and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in lavender flowers. Serve quail with onion sauce.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
