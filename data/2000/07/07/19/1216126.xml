        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Learning to Say 'I've Had Enough,' '' by Sally L. Satel (Op-Ed, July 14): It's not only mainstream treatment groups that advise abstinence for ''problem drinkers,'' as opposed to alcoholics: the federal government also recommends that this group, too, not drink.</p>
        <p>More significant, one must ask what makes alcohol so necessary that we are willing to jeopardize the lives of problem drinkers as well as those of the people with whom they come into contact by suggesting that they can learn to moderate their drinking.</p>
        <p>Millions of Americans will testify that their lives improved dramatically once they stopped drinking. We should be more supportive of these efforts instead of trying to justify continued problematic use of a drug that is our country's third leading cause of preventable death.</p>
