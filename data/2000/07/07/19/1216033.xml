        <p>They call it the Old Course, yet every round offers something new.</p>
        <p>Few golf courses in the world change from day to day, or even hour to hour, like the Old Course at St. Andrews. When the weather is calm, birdies beckon. When the weather is blustery, it becomes a beast.</p>
        <p>Much of what happens in this year's British Open, which begins Thursday, will be determined by the unpredictable weather, especially the wind. If the weather is benign, the winning score could be lower than Nick Faldo's 270 (18 under par) in 1990, the lowest Open score at St. Andrews. But if the wind whips for three or four days, expect a winning score around 282 (six under par), the score John Daly won with in 1995.</p>
        <p>The layout of St. Andrews is unique, featuring many distinctive characteristics -- deep pot bunkers, enormous double greens, wide and fast fairways and blind tee shots. With so many variables, nobody is sure what to expect. And that is part of what makes St. Andrews intriguing.</p>
        <p>''Every time I play it, I learn something new about the golf course,'' said Tiger Woods after today's practice round. ''That is one of the great things about this course -- so many things to learn, different wind conditions.</p>
        <p>''Even for a British Open, this is different. It's so much faster. It's weird to have the fairways faster than the greens. It's different to what we're used to in the States, different than we're used to seeing in British Opens. It's going to be a wonderful championship.''</p>
        <p>It will take shot-making and sound strategy to win, but long hitters like Woods enter the tournament with a huge advantage, at least on paper. In calm conditions, long hitters can fly the ball over many of the notorious, deep-faced bunkers that are part of St. Andrews's character. Anyone who spends significant time in the sand this week will not win. Spending time in a deep bunker at St. Andrews can be like spending time in prison.</p>
        <p>''If you hit it firm into the bunkers, you will be in there forever if you're not careful,'' Vijay Singh said. ''If you hit in the wrong place, it is impossible to get out.''</p>
        <p>Expect to see some players hit sideways out of some bunkers, or even backward away from the hole, if that is the easiest way to get out. Nobody wants to duplicate Tommy Nakajima in 1978, who needed five shots to escape the Road Hole bunker at No. 17, one of the most difficult holes in the world.</p>
        <p>Avoiding the bunkers is not easy, because many of them cannot be seen from the tee boxes. Meanwhile, with the fairways so fast this year, coupled with the slopes in the fairways, a good shot can quickly become a bad shot if it lands on grass and rolls into sand.</p>
        <p>''At this place, you have a premium on driving the golf ball,'' David Duval said. ''The penalty is not knee-high rough. It's pot bunkers. You really need to be conscious of the line you choose off tees, because you can't see those bunkers.''</p>
        <p>Putting is important at any major, but the greens at St. Andrews are large and undulating. When some of the pins are tucked into dangerous positions, players will be forced to hit safe approach shots, leaving them 50 to 60 feet away from the cup.</p>
        <p>Lag putting will be very important this week. Those who can consistently two-putt from long range will save themselves strokes. And because the conditions are so fast, many players will putt from well off the green, rather than risk a chip shot that could roll far beyond the pin.</p>
        <p>But the wind will dictate much of the strategy. The wind at St. Andrews can change strength and direction without warning, making club selection extremely difficult. With a strong wind, a player with Woods's power can drive the ball 400 yards.</p>
        <p>St. Andrews has been lengthened almost 200 yards to 7,115 yards since it last played host to the Open in 1995. But seven of the par-4 holes measure less than 400 yards, and if the wind is at their backs, expect many players to go for the greens off the tee.</p>
        <p>Both of the par-5 holes, No. 5 (568 yards) and No. 14 (581 yards) are reachable in two shots, and the final hole, the 357-yard No. 18, can be reached with a drive.</p>
        <p>''I hit a couple of drives 360, 380 yards,'' Faldo said. ''So Tiger will be hitting them 450. He can drive six of the greens, and he reaches the fifth hole with a driver and a wedge. He's the man to beat.''</p>
        <p>But many top players are performing well heading into the tournament, like Ernie Els, who won in Loch Lomond, Scotland, on Saturday, and Lee Westwood, who has won three of his last six tournaments.</p>
        <p>Not every player likes St. Andrews, but every player respects its history. And this weekend, one player will become a part of that history, winning the 2000 British Open on a course that should present a different challenge every day.</p>
        <p>''I've never played particularly well here, so that's probably why I haven't enjoyed it much,'' Westwood said. ''But it's growing on me. It's a good test of golf. I am going to learn to like it this week.''</p>
