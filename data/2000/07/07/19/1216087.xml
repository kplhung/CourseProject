        <p>A Federal appeals court handed local telephone companies a legal victory yesterday as it struck down pricing rules that Federal regulators had hoped would foster competition in local communications markets.</p>
        <p>The Federal Communications Commission, whose rules were overturned, could ask the Supreme Court to review yesterday's decision. But if the ruling stands, it could entail millions of dollars in additional network-connection costs for long-distance giants like AT&amp;T and Worldcom as well as for new companies that are trying to break into the local telephone business.</p>
        <p>Put simply, yesterday's ruling could lead to an increase in the fees that other companies pay for connecting to the networks of incumbent local carriers. When AT&amp;T or a small start-up offers local phone service in New York, for example, the company usually pays a fee to Bell Atlantic (which recently merged with GTE and renamed itself Verizon) for using the copper wires into customers' homes. Yesterday's ruling could lead to an increase in that fee.</p>
        <p>''In a nutshell I think this means these rates will go up,'' William P. Barr, the former Attorney General who is Verizon's general counsel, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Using the telecommunications shorthand ''CLEC's'' to refer to new local phone companies as competitive local exchange carriers, he added, ''To the extent that CLEC's have been getting a free ride, that's going to stop.''</p>
        <p>An AT&amp;T official, speaking on the condition that he not be identified by name, said: ''The fact that so few American consumers have a choice of local service is regrettable. If the price for interconnection with the incumbent network goes up, it will only make this process harder, if feasible at all. It will hardly be a victory for public policy.''</p>
        <p>In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the government required incumbent local phone companies -- not only the Bells but also carriers like GTE and Southern New England Telecommunications -- to open their networks to outside competitors.</p>
        <p>To implement that requirement, the F.C.C. came up with a system to determine just what the incumbents could charge competitors for using the necessary elements of their networks to provide local service. The commission's system required the incumbents to charge as if they used the most efficient, technically advanced communications equipment on the market. That methodology was meant to encourage the incumbents to invest in their networks and also to make it less expensive for new carriers to enter local markets.</p>
        <p>But the incumbent phone giants, which do not always use the most efficient, technically advanced equipment on the market, protested that the rate system was unfair and that the prices they were allowed to charge were in some cases below their actual costs. The incumbents argued that they should be able to charge fees based on their actual costs, not the costs of a hypothetical network.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a three-judge panel for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit, in St. Louis, agreed with the local carriers, saying that the F.C.C. rules violated the communications act itself. ''Congress was dealing with reality, not fantasizing about what might be,'' the court wrote.</p>
        <p>The decision invalidating the pricing rules would not take effect for 45 days. An F.C.C. official said a decision on whether to ask for a stay and whether to appeal the ruling could come within weeks.</p>
        <p>''There are no clear winners or losers in today's decision,'' William E. Kennard, the F.C.C. chairman, said in a released statement. ''We will take immediate steps to minimize any uncertainty created by this decision while continuing to foster competition and consumer choice in local telephone service.''</p>
        <p>The local phone incumbents did lose in one major aspect of the court's decision. The incumbents had asked the court to overturn the F.C.C.'s practice of basing prices on future network costs, rather than on historical costs for building those systems. The court rejected that argument, which could have enabled the local carriers to charge even higher prices for connecting to their networks.</p>
        <p>But on balance, yesterday's decision was a victory for local phone carriers. In addition to invalidating the F.C.C. rate structure, which covered piece-by-piece access to networks, the court paved the way for the local incumbents to increase the wholesale rates they charge for providing a complete package of local services to competitors.</p>
        <p>The court also made it easier for local phone incumbents in rural areas to avoid having to open parts of their networks to outsiders.</p>
