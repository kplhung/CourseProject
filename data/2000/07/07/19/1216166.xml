        <p>GREIG-Thea Dispeker. Born September 28, 1902 in Munich, Germany. Died on July 17,2000 after a long illness, at the age of almost 98, in her home in Manhattan. She grew up in a family of prominent lawyers, but soon music became the center of her personal and professional life. After her elevation to Musicologist, she worked in the late 20's until 1933 in Berlin at the Culture Ministry for Special School Music projects. With her family she emigrated in 1938 to New York, where she soon started to work for several artists' managements. In 1947 she founded her own: Thea Dispeker, Inc., one of the outstanding worldwide artists' representative agencies. For almost 50 years she ran her office and gave artistic and, more importantly, always great human support to every one of her artists. She was an exceptional personality in her business and enjoyed innumerable friendships all over the world. She leaves a niece, Fay Freed, and a nephew Stephen Schlesinger, and their families. Contributions in her memory should be made to The Thea Dispeker Voice Scholarship Fund of Mannes College of Music, 150 W. 85 St, New York, N.Y. 10024. A memorial will be held at Mannes College in September. Exact date to be announced.</p>
