        <p>WURMFELD-Michael. The Cooper Union Federation of College Teachers, (Local 3163 NYSUT, AFT, AFL-CIO) mourns the passing on July 15 of one of our founding members, Professor Michael Wurmfeld, whose courageous efforts to secure the benefits of collective bargaining for his colleagues are not forgotten. His intellectual, aesthetic and social views made a lasting impact on his students and colleagues, and we rejoice in the beautiful works that he has left to posterity.</p>
        <p>WURMFELD-Michael. The volunteers and staff of Mishkon, a program of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, mourn the passing of Michael Wurmfeld.
