        <p>Two months ago, Michael Johnson told a small group of reporters that he would never borrow again from professional wrestling to hype a race. He had learned his lesson three years ago, he said, when he traded verbal half-nelsons with Donovan Bailey of Canada to promote a manufactured 150-meter race. Johnson ended up grabbing his leg in injury while Bailey grabbed the title of world's fastest man.</p>
        <p>''I did the W.W.F. thing,'' Johnson said, referring to the match race in Toronto between the Olympic 100- and 200-meter champions. ''I'm not doing it anymore. I did it for the sake of the sport, and it all worked well until the gun went off and I got injured. That's not me. That's not what I'm about.''</p>

        <p>Two months ago, Michael Johnson told a small group of reporters that he would never borrow again from professional wrestling to hype a race. He had learned his lesson three years ago, he said, when he traded verbal half-nelsons with Donovan Bailey of Canada to promote a manufactured 150-meter race. Johnson ended up grabbing his leg in injury while Bailey grabbed the title of world's fastest man.</p>
        <p>''I did the W.W.F. thing,'' Johnson said, referring to the match race in Toronto between the Olympic 100- and 200-meter champions. ''I'm not doing it anymore. I did it for the sake of the sport, and it all worked well until the gun went off and I got injured. That's not me. That's not what I'm about.''</p>
        <p>Yet, facing an expected showdown at 200 meters on Sunday with Maurice Greene, the current world record-holder at 100 meters, the normally taciturn Johnson has again decided to hurl a few verbal body slams. His words, both spoken and written, have provided a riveting if uncharacteristic subtext to the most eagerly awaited event of the Olympic track and field trials. And they reflect the fact that, despite his gold medals and world records at 200 meters (19.32 seconds) and 400 meters (43.18 seconds), Johnson has found it necessary to repeatedly defend his stunning accomplishments against what he considers disrespectful remarks about his speed, character and integrity. ''I feel I need to defend myself,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>He added, ''I do dislike a lot of things Maurice Greene has said about me and his attempt to elevate himself using my name.''</p>
        <p>Bailey, the 1996 Olympic champion at 100 meters, charged that Johnson faked the injury to his left thigh once he realized he was going to lose their 1997 match race. Greene's camp has accused Johnson of ducking him on the international circuit. Greene has also suggested that Johnson's world record at 200 meters was set in Atlanta mainly because the track was built at the limit of allowable hardness. Johnson bristles at these slights, which nag at him like a pulled hamstring muscle.</p>
        <p>''Donovan was a young guy who came into the sport and did not show any consistency,'' Johnson said in a recent interview. ''He won a gold medal that they were going to give to someone anyway. I did something in Atlanta that no one had ever done. I put more pressure on myself than anyone. Now all of a sudden I'm supposed to be faking it? And I'm supposed to be afraid of Maurice, a guy who has never run faster than 19.8? That's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>This season, Johnson has called Greene immature. Last Friday, in a column written for USA Today, Johnson said that Greene was not smart for scheduling a flurry of races in Europe during late June and early July. He also criticized Greene's Los Angeles-based training group, known as Hudson Smith International, saying the members were unfocused and resting on past accomplishments. His assessment of H.S.I. was inaccurate -- the group's athletes have swept all three Olympic spots in the men's 100 meters, taken a silver medal in the women's 100 meters and won first place in the men's pole vault and long jump -- but Johnson has hardly retracted his words.</p>
        <p>''Some people aren't used to being criticized,'' Johnson said. ''You either handle it or you don't.''</p>
        <p>Greene has said he viewed the trials 200 as a semifinal match, with the Olympics being the final, but he has also said, ''I'm going to get Michael.'' Johnson said he would not settle for second place at the trials because ''I'm better than that.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think winning the race is going to silence any critics,'' Johnson said. ''Once I beat him, Maurice will say, 'My goal is to win the Olympic Games.' Which is what he's supposed to say. I'm not going to win to silence him, but because I can win and I'm supposed to.''</p>
        <p>Trash-talking is an age-old custom in the sprints, where athletes look for the slightest edge in races decided by hundredths of a second. Johnson said he believed that Greene's bravado came from insecurity not confidence. Greene said he laughed at Johnson's public comments and just wants to put on a show. ''I like the W.W.F.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But why the criticism of Johnson, who possesses a combination of speed and endurance unmatched in the history of sprinting? ''I think that's just the nature of the sport,'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who finished third to Johnson in the 200 at the Atlanta Olympics and who trains daily with Greene in Los Angeles. ''Michael Johnson could have 15 gold medals. He'd still be attacked by guys like me and Maurice who want what he has. There is no respect in this sport. You are only as good as your last race, and even then you are going to be disrespected.''</p>
        <p>Sprinters are reluctant to speak respectfully of each other, Johnson said, for fear of showing vulnerability. The quarter-milers who have faced him, however, have been forced into deferential submission by his dominance. Johnson has lost only 3 of 78 races over 400 meters in the past 11 years. He won the Olympic trials on Sunday by nearly a second.</p>
        <p>At the 200, injury has made Johnson more vulnerable in recent years. He has run 16 200-meter races since breaking the world record in Atlanta, but only four times has he dipped under 20 seconds. He owns the fastest time in the world this year, 19.71 seconds, but that was a race at altitude in South Africa. His fastest time at sea level since Atlanta is 19.91 seconds, slower than Greene's personal best of 19.86. The two sprinters have met twice at 200 meters, and each has won once. Greene won the 200 meters at the 1999 world championships in Seville, Spain, while Johnson did not enter the event, concentrating on the 400 meters.</p>
        <p>In Boldon's estimation, the first person off the curve on Sunday will be the winner at the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>''Michael knows he's not going to come off the turn behind Maurice and run him down,'' Boldon said. ''Not now. Not unless he's in 19.32 shape, which I don't think he is. If he is in 19.32 shape, it doesn't matter what Maurice does. If Maurice comes off the turn with a significant lead, that's it. Michael will not only not challenge, Michael will appreciate the fact that every time he's run a really fast 200, he's been hurt. He will settle for second and bear the brunt of criticism to come and prepare for the Olympics. On the other hand, if Maurice comes off even or behind, he's going to floor it. He's going to try to get Michael. I don't know if Michael can be run down.''</p>
        <p>In running his startling world record at Atlanta, Johnson injured his left hamstring muscle. Against Bailey in 1997, he injured the thigh muscle in his left leg. It was later determined that the sacroiliac joint in his pelvis was slightly rotated, which threw out of alignment the muscles in his left leg, making them less efficient.</p>
        <p>''It's like a cup of coffee in a saucer that's not quite sitting in the groove, or a car with a front end that's out of alignment,'' said Dale Smith, who is Johnson's physical therapist. ''A tire that gets 60,000 miles now will only get 15 or 20,000.''</p>
        <p>The greatest race of Johnson's career may not have been his world records, but the 400-meter final at the 1997 world championship in Athens, when he came from fifth in the final curve to first at the finish on guts and experience. Tests later revealed that his left leg had become slightly shorter, was still carrying significant amounts of fluid from the injury against Bailey and was 30 percent weaker than his right leg.</p>
        <p>''Under the circumstances, that might have been his finest race,'' said Clyde Hart, who coaches Johnson in Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>Since then, Smith travels to each race with Johnson, often immersing him in ice baths and massaging him or helping him stretch late into the evening after running rounds. Greene asserted that Johnson would shut down if he was behind out of the curve Sunday, saying Johnson ''doesn't want to put his body through that kind of stress because every time something happens to him.''</p>
        <p>The Johnson camp fumes at this, pointing out that he chased down the 400 field in Athens on pure determination. There is nothing to show that a sprinter is more susceptible to injury running from behind than in front, Hart said. ''Besides that,'' he added, ''we don't tend to be behind.''</p>
        <p>Johnson said: ''That's the difference between Maurice and me. Maurice depends on me being afraid and shutting down or breaking down to win races. I depend on Michael running great to win races. It's obvious now that he feels the only way he can win this race is to make me break down.''</p>
        <p>The brash but patient Greene, who holds the world record of 9.79 seconds at 100 meters, believes the two runners will come off the curve together, or within one and a half steps of each other, and that he will pull victory out at the end. ''My foot speed is greater than his,'' Greene said. ''I believe I am a lot stronger sprinter than he is.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I can't afford to let him come off the curve three or four steps ahead. If he's that far ahead, I'll press too hard to catch him and run out of gas.''</p>
        <p>Boldon, the 1997 world champion at 200 meters, said he would give the nod to Johnson because of experience. ''It doesn't mean I don't think Maurice can win,'' he said of his training partner. ''But I don't think Maurice understands that this is a race where there are 10 ways to win it and 20 to lose it. Michael has probably eliminated 19 ways to lose.''</p>
