        <p>There are those people who wake up to the weather report and those who don't. The Weather Channel thrives because so many of us do, and the History Channel has noticed.

        <p>Almost every other Wednesday night at 11, through the end of the year, weather disaster buffs can have a nightcap of typhoons, hurricanes, avalanches and floods. The series begins with ''Mississippi: River Out of Control,'' about the flood of 1927 that killed 500 to 1,000 people and left almost one million more homeless. Children of the region would grow up hearing their parents date everything ''before the flood'' and ''after the flood.''</p>

        <p>Almost every other Wednesday night at 11, through the end of the year, weather disaster buffs can have a nightcap of typhoons, hurricanes, avalanches and floods. The series begins with ''Mississippi: River Out of Control,'' about the flood of 1927 that killed 500 to 1,000 people and left almost one million more homeless. Children of the region would grow up hearing their parents date everything ''before the flood'' and ''after the flood.''</p>
        <p>Produced and written by Ginny Weissman, this sober and informative program offers a no-nonsense account of nature's response to human hubris. Southern plantation owners needed to be near the river to transport cotton, the region's big cash crop. The levees they built to control flooding also built pressure in the contained water after a big rain.  In April 1927 there were many big rains -- 15 inches fell on New Orleans in one 18-hour period -- and the levees burst. It was like a balloon popping, says one of the documentary's historian-commentators, and the water poured out like escaping air.</p>
        <p>We learn that at its peak the river zoomed along at three million cubic feet a second, double the volume of water that cascades over Niagara Falls. The Bible and Shakespeare describe the futility of man trying to circumvent nature more poetically, but the History Channel delivers good pictures. The documentary shows families paddling boats up a town's main street, eye to eye with chimneys. One man fashioned what could be called Noah's barge, a kind of floating pen for his farm animals. We see the refugee tent camps constructed after the flood, eerily prescient of the Depression tent camps.</p>
        <p>Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Commerce under President Calvin Coolidge, emerges cleanly for his sensitive handling of the post-flood trauma. But there was plenty of insensitivity, even brutality. Local police officers rounded up convicts to stuff and pile sandbags on the levees. The convicts were joined in this dangerous work by black farm workers, who had been ordered to the riverfront by their employers. These workers were the first to bear the brunt of the flood when the banks overflowed -- many drowned -- and the last to leave the refugee camps.</p>
        <p>The documentary explains the political maneuvering that saved New Orleans, by washing out her smaller neighbors. As the flood moved south from Greenville, Miss., New Orleans politicians and businessmen convinced Louisiana's governor to divert the flood to neighboring parishes, which were much less populated. Their deal included payments of $20 a person for the displaced country folks.</p>
        <p>Much like their ancestors who gathered on hills to watch Civil War battles, many New Orleans residents went to watch the explosion upriver that would destroy the levees and change the Mississippi's course. The sacrificial towns were destroyed as planned, and then their people never received the promised reparations.</p>
        <p>A man who was a boy then recalls going back into his home after the flood: ''Oh, mud was everywhere -- and stink.'' But the terrible vision of the flood also contained ''an awful beauty,'' says one commentator, that lingers for historians, archaeologists, memoirists, filmmakers and disaster buffs.</p>
