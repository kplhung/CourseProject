        <p>OfficeMax, the third-largest United States office supply chain, said yesterday that it had chosen Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in Chicago, part of Publicis S.A., to handle its national account.

        <p>Billings were estimated at $45 million.</p>
        <p>Steve Baisden, a spokesman for OfficeMax in Shaker Heights, Ohio, said the decision came after a seven-month review that had been narrowed to Publicis and four other agencies that he declined to identify.</p>
        <p>Office Max and Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, parted ways in January after a five-year relationship.</p>
        <p>OfficeMax is conducting a separate review for the OfficeMax.com account, with billings estimated at $15 million.</p>
