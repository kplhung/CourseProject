        <p>Gov. George W. Bush extolled the importance of fatherhood today, lamenting the prevalence of children growing up without the guidance of both parents and saying he would direct the federal government to spend more money to coax fathers toward responsibility.</p>
        <p>The amount he was talking about, $40 million a year, was small, and the goal he was talking about was anything but controversial.</p>
        <p>But part of Mr. Bush's prescription, allowing the money to go to groups that use religion in their efforts to unite fathers with their families, illustrated a philosophy that has raised questions about the separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush talked about this approach during a panel discussion at a private agency in Milwaukee, Faith Works, which incorporates religion into its efforts to rehabilitate fathers with drug and alcohol problems and guide them into schools and jobs.</p>
        <p>''Faith does work,'' Mr. Bush said in Milwaukee this morning, before he headed here for several campaign events. ''It's a powerful concept. It's not a government concept, by the way. It recognizes that there are powers greater than mankind.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also said that while the federal government should do its part to help finance such efforts it should recognize ''programs that exist in spite of government, that help people who may be coming out of prison, to help them find work, but also remind folks of the importance of being a dad.''</p>
        <p>A description of Mr. Bush's proposed policy distributed by his campaign aides said that most of the money would be directed by the federal Department of Health and Human Services toward groups, including those affiliated with churches, that help low-income fathers find work and promote being responsible parents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's proposal and the setting in which he unveiled it, an inner-city agency that serves many African-Americans, were intended to bolster his portrayal of himself as a different kind of Republican with special concern for underprivileged people.</p>
        <p>The event also underscored the occasional exhortations by Mr. Bush, who considers himself a devout Christian, for Americans to rediscover the benefits of more traditional mores. So did the words of one of the other panelists.</p>
        <p>Michael Joyce, who helps raise private money for faith-based programs, said that this morning's event would have been unimaginable a decade ago, when ''Murphy Brown,'' a television comedy, ''taught elites that they could raise children without having a dad in the house.'' The comment alluded to former Vice President Dan Quayle's complaint at the time that the show exalted single motherhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joyce hailed the progress that he said had been made since then, and said that it certainly could not be attributed to ''the example, say, of the leader of the free world, in terms of parental virtue.'' That was an allusion to President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has also advocated a role for religious organizations in providing social services, with certain caveats. But he has not pushed this approach as aggressively as Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush left Milwaukee and arrived here around midday to address the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
        <p>He was introduced, at his campaign's request, by the Democratic speaker of the Texas House, Pete Laney, an arrangement the Texas governor said was an indication of the bipartisan spirit he had brought to government in his state.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Bush attended a dinner here that was expected to raise about $3 million for the Republican Party.</p>
