        <p>LAST month, I flew to California to be a judge at the San Francisco International Wine Competition. The event attracted wines from 16 countries and 22 states in this country, many of them places no one normally thinks of as sources of good wine.</p>
        <p>A few days ago, when the final results were faxed to all 42 of us -- importers, distributors, sommeliers, wine writers -- who had been judges, what particularly interested me, aside from the fact that we got through a record 2,783 wines, was the number of moderately priced wines that did well.</p>
        <p>Against wines costing $100 and more, the best white was judged to be a 1999 sauvignon blanc from New Zealand's Giesen Wine Estate listed at $13. The best red was a tie: the 1997 Joseph Phelps Insignia, a cabernet-based blend that lists at $120, and the 1997 Storrs Winery BXR Red Table wine, at $32.</p>
        <p>Among the eight best-of-variety winners were four wines priced at $10 or less, including a sprightly Italian, a 1998 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Dario d'Angelo at $5. There are restaurants in New York that get four times that for a bottle of water.</p>
        <p>Let me explain about those 2,783 wines. Accepted wisdom holds that no one can taste that many wines over a weekend and come away with a coherent assessment. The accepted wisdom is wrong.</p>
        <p>In theory, that total can be broken down into 10 groups of about 280 wines, a not insignificant number but hardly daunting to a team of seasoned judges. Spread over several days and divided into groups of five or six varieties -- cabernet, merlot, pinot noir, zinfandel and so on -- it becomes a rigorous but hardly onerous exercise. In practice, the sizes of the groups vary widely; there might be hundreds of chardonnays but only a few lembergers or scheurebes.</p>
        <p>Good wine judges work fast, sniffing, tasting and spitting, all the while scribbling cryptic notes only they understand. Many wines are never tasted; they are eliminated by smell. The best panels usually include two or three people who have previously worked together; in discussing each flight of wines, they understand each other's remarks, which can be almost as cryptic as their notes.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco competition awards gold, silver, bronze and double gold medals. To receive a double gold, a wine must get a gold medal from the panel that judges it in its own variety group, and then another gold from the entire group of 42 judges, who compare it with all the other gold medal winners.</p>
        <p>There were 35 double golds, or just over 1 percent of the wines entered. There were 85 single golds, 327 silvers and 835 bronzes. Seem like a lot of medals? It is. But wineries enter these competitions to win medals; no medals, no entries. And the San Francisco International is one of the roughest competitions. In half-hearted defense of such largesse it can be said that wines in general have improved considerably in recent years. What better proof of that than the fact that so many relatively unknown wines ended up in the winners' circle along with the thoroughbreds.</p>
        <p>Consider that both the best merlot and the best syrah in the show cost $8. What's more, both were from the same Australian winery, Stonehaven Vineyards. The merlot was a 1999; the shiraz, a 1998. Of course, in that part of the world, syrah is called shiraz.</p>
        <p>Other bests included, for riesling, a 1999 halbtrocken (half dry) from the Prinz von Hessen, from the Rheingau in Germany, at $11; and for cabernet sauvignon, a 1997 Amberhill from Raymond Vineyard in California at $10.</p>
        <p>It was especially heartening to see gold medals awarded to nontraditional wines and nontraditional wine-producing regions. They included a 1999 Steinberg from the Stone Hill Winery in Hermann, Mo., ($9) and a 1999 Seyval blanc from another Missouri producer, the St. James Winery in St. James ($10).</p>
        <p>A gold medal for Willie Frank's 1999 riesling from the Konstantin Frank winery in the Finger Lakes ($10) strengthens my feeling that one day, New York State could become the ultimate source of fine rieslings in this country.</p>
        <p>Not all the winners carried bargain basement prices. The best dessert wine, a double gold winner, was a 1998 riesling icewine from Jackson-Triggs Vintners in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, at $46. The best chardonnay was a 1998 single vineyard wine from Mirassou Vineyards in Monterey County at $24; the best malbec, a 1997 Alexander Valley wine from Geyser Peak in Sonoma, $20; the best sparkling wine, a Gloria Ferrer 1992 brut from Freixenet in the Carneros section of Sonoma, $22.</p>
        <p>Among the winners, there was a noticeable lack of famous names, either from this country or certainly from France. If Anthony Dias Blue, the wine and spirits editor of Bon Appetit magazine, who runs the San Francisco competition, persists in turning up low-priced winners he may frighten off the powerhouse wine producers, who can ill afford to have a pack of upstarts ruffle their promotional feathers.</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the results of the competition would seem to show that, shorn of their carefully constructed mystiques, their beautiful labels and clever marketing, many expensive wines are really not that much superior to their less-expensive rivals. Maybe the veritas really is in the vino.</p>
