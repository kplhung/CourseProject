        <p>A former state parole official testified yesterday that his supervisor had gotten ''a tremendous amount of pressure'' from the Pataki administration to release a violent felon whose family had contributed thousands of dollars to the governor's 1994 election campaign.</p>
        <p>The former official, Ronald Hotaling, also testified that he received a request from an official in the state's Community Affairs office to report back to her about whether the prisoner was released.</p>
        <p>The testimony by Mr. Hotaling was in Federal District Court in Brooklyn yesterday at the trial of Yung Soo Yoo, a New Jersey businessman who was often tapped by the Republican Party to raise money among Koreans in the New York area. Mr. Yoo, 63, has been charged with telling three Korean families in Queens that he would use his influence to obtain parole for their sons if they donated thousands of dollars to Gov. George E. Pataki's campaign.</p>
        <p>The prosecution of Mr. Yoo stems from a two-and-a-half-year federal investigation into accusations that Pataki officials used the promise of early parole to help fill the governor's campaign coffers. The prosecutors overseeing the case have repeatedly said there is no evidence that Mr. Pataki participated in or had knowledge of the crimes alleged.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors also introduced a letter they said was written in November 1996 by Mr. Yoo addressed to Patrick Donohue, who at the time was Mr. Pataki's campaign finance director. The letter said that two contributors were furious that their sons had not been released and were threatening to go public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue has not been charged in connection with the case, and his lawyer, Thomas Puccio, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment yesterday. The defense said yesterday that it planned to call him as a witness as early as this morning.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hotaling also testified that Brion D. Travis, the chairman of the parole board, received a message in April 1996 from the governor's office advocating the release of John Kim of Queens, who was serving time for armed robberies. Two years earlier, Mr. Kim's family and their supporters contributed about $7,000 to Mr. Pataki's campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hotaling said Mr. Travis then told him to relay the interest of the governor's office in the case to two of the three parole commissioners charged with deciding on Mr. Kim's release. The two commissioners, Sean McSherry and Leo S. Levy, voted to parole Mr. Kim after he had served the minimum of his 4-to-12-year sentence, the first opportunity he was eligible for release.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hotaling also said Grace Koh of the Community Affairs office  asked him to call her after the ruling on Mr. Kim's parole was made. She has not been charged in the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hotaling, 53, pleaded guilty last year to lying to a grand jury in this case to cover up his dealings with Mr. Travis and the two parole commissioners in this case. Mr. McSherry was convicted in August 1999 of lying to the same grand jury, and Mr. Levy was charged last month with misleading investigators in the case.</p>
