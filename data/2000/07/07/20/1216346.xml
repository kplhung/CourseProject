        <p>The mound was vacant as the Yankees' position players ran onto the field for the eighth inning last night, their lead over Detroit secure. There was some doubt as to whether the starting pitcher would come out for another inning, but when the burly man wearing No. 22 trotted out of the dugout, the fans cheered.</p>
        <p>For Roger Clemens, they cheered and hollered, little more than a month after they booed him off the mound on the night the Mets destroyed him. Much has changed since then. Clemens has changed; he's Roger Clemens again.</p>
        <p>Now he's pumping fastballs for strikes early in the count, finishing off hitters with splitters and sliders;  now he's brushing back hitters. Now Clemens wins about every game he pitches. For the first time since joining the Yankees, Clemens has won four consecutive starts, after whiffing 11 and walking none in eight innings of a 9-1 thrashing of the Tigers last night at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''He's throwing a lot like he did when he faced us,'' said Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop.</p>
        <p>''I feel strong,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>Clemens was activated off the disabled list July 2, after a couple of weeks in Tampa, Fla., and after hearing another in a series of free motivational speeches from George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner. Clemens has won all of his starts since then, compiling a 1.84 earned run average, striking out 24 and walking 6 in 29 1/3 innings. Manager Joe Torre was quick to credit Steinbrenner last night for playing a role in Clemens's turnaround, but then, it would be impolitic not to. What seems more plausible is that Clemens has reinvested in his fastball. Jeter and Jorge Posada and others on the Yankees have noticed how much more aggressive he is with it.</p>
        <p>Clemens often threw his slider and splitter early in the count last year, fell behind in the count, and then was pounded when opponents were able to anticipate a particular pitch.</p>
        <p>He is throwing fastballs, with impunity -- Detroit's Dean Palmer got pushed back in the second inning last night -- and attacking batters. Clemens (8-6) threw strikes on the first pitch to 11 of the first 14 batters he faced; the climate was right for aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>The first pitch he threw in the game was a fastball, to Luis Polonia, a few inches off the edge of the plate, and Posada caught it, framed it for Brian O'Nora, the home plate umpire. Strike one, said O'Nora.</p>
        <p>Clemens spun a slider to the same spot. Strike two, O'Nora called.</p>
        <p>Clemens and Posada ascertained immediately that they were working with favorable conditions.</p>
        <p>''It didn't cost us the ballgame,'' said Phil Garner, the Detroit manager, ''but he had a wide zone.''</p>
        <p>Said Brad Ausmus, the Tigers catcher: ''Clemens is tough enough to face with a regular strike zone. As a hitter, you get upset. To his credit, he's an intelligent pitcher, he's going to take advantage of it.''</p>
        <p>Hideo Nomo could not. The Detroit right-hander could not throw strikes; the Yankees drew walks, or waited for pitches to hammer. Jeter -- who has two first-inning walks in his last five games, after going 55 games without one -- walked in the first inning and went home when Paul O'Neill bashed a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>Jeter lined a three-run triple in the second inning, Nomo was knocked out in the third, David Justice slammed a two-run homer in the fourth, and Clemens could pitch stress free. It was the 96th game of his career with 10 or more strikeouts, one fewer than Sandy Koufax, who ranks third in that category. It was the 255th victory of Clemens's career, 35th best in history.</p>
        <p>Clemens trotted off after the eighth inning, to more cheering, and he and Posada chatted easily in the dugout. Clemens complimented Posada for being able to frame the fastballs he threw to the outside corner, rather than letting the impact of the pitch turn his glove.</p>
        <p>''No windshield wipers,'' Clemens said.</p>
        <p>He is throwing harder than he did in May, Ausmus thought, 93 to 95 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>He is Roger Clemens, again.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, placed on the disabled list Tuesday, will undergo tests on his elbow today. Hernandez has had trouble with his back and arm this year, and admitted he's gained weight.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees could do everything made-to-order, they would pick up a hard-hitting right-handed left fielder with enough defensive ability to play center field. But everything is not made-to-order, and they are considering even the imperfect options. The Yankees may wait beyond the July 31 trade deadline to make a deal, according to one club official, and by the end of August, more players could be available, as teams fall out of the pennant races. Until then, their best lineup is arguably with CHUCK KNOBLAUCH as the designated hitter and JOSE VIZCAINO playing second base -- a lineup Manager JOE TORRE used for the seventh time in last night's game against Detroit.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't bother me,'' Knoblauch said. ''I think it's about what the best thing is for the team, and if that's what it takes, I'm all for it.''</p>
        <p>Torre would prefer another solution. ''You'd like a little more power potential,'' Torre said. ''I'd like to get another guy in there who's more of a threat.''</p>
