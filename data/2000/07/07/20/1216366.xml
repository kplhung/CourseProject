        <p>Ray Lewis has suffered enough, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the National Football League said in a conference call yesterday in explaining why he did not suspend the All-Pro linebacker who pleaded guilty to obstructing justice in a murder case.</p>
        <p>''It's the courts who have the primary responsibility in this case,'' Tagliabue said. ''We're not a substitute for the courts.''</p>
        <p>''The offense was a misdemeanor; he had no problems before that and hadn't violated league policies,'' Tagliabue said of Lewis's guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of obstructing justice in a deal with Atlanta prosecutors, who dropped murder charges against the Ravens star.</p>
        <p>Lewis and his lawyers met with Tagliabue on July 10 to discuss the situation. N.F.L. officials said a fine was still possible, but reiterated that there would be no suspension, which can be imposed against players convicted of various offenses. (AP)</p>
        <p>49ERS SIGN CARMAZZI: San Francisco signed quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi, the first of its two third-round picks in this year's draft, to a three-year contract.</p>
        <p>Carmazzi was the 65th overall selection after he set 11 school records at Hofstra University during his four-year career, passing for 9,731 yards and 71 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>The 49ers have three other quarterbacks in training camp. Carmazzi and the rookie Tim Rattay will probably compete for the third-string job. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>BUTKUS JOINS XFL: Dick Butkus, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame since 1979, was hired to coach Chicago's XFL franchise, becoming the first coach named by the World Wrestling Federation's league. Butkus, a middle linebacker for the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1973, has no coaching experience, but calls the appointment a unique challenge.(Bloomberg News)</p>
