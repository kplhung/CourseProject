        <p>Over the years, Keane Fletcher has dutifully, if unenthusiastically, complied with every new directive imposed on him by the European Union. A third-generation butcher, he even agreed to take a course last year in which he was taught, among other things, how to tell when food is not altogether fresh (one suggested method: check the expiration date).</p>
        <p>But in March, when the local government in Rotherham (pronounced ROTH-uh-rum) threatened to seize his late grandfather's antique porcelain scale because it violated Europe's metric measurement requirements, Mr. Fletcher briefly forgot that he was a serious-minded family man with his own business and two sons to raise.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Make sure you send big men, because as sure as there are eggs there on that counter, I'll break their jaws,' '' recalled Mr. Fletcher, 37, a onetime amateur boxer who keeps the old scale in his shop, in a housing development in this gritty South Yorkshire town, for sentimental reasons. ''I said, 'You can put me on death row, but I'm not removing those scales.' ''</p>
        <p>No one is saying that people like Mr. Fletcher, who weighs his meat in pounds and ounces with an electronic scale, have not had ample warning about the government's metrification program. Britain first talked about going metric back in the mid-19th century.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, when it joined the Common Market, the European Union's predecessor, the country pledged to replace its old imperial system, which uses pounds, yards, pints and the like, with the Europe-wide metric system, based on grams, meters and liters.</p>
        <p>Britain duly converted, selling its gasoline in liters and, more recently, its supermarket goods in grams. But small shopkeepers like Mr. Fletcher remained exempt until Jan. 1 of this year. It was then that new government regulations took effect, requiring every seller of loose goods -- things like fruits, vegetables, carpets, window shades, loose candy and meat -- to begin selling in metric units.</p>
        <p>The point, of course, was to harmonize with the rest of the European Union, a concept that is dear to the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair. But a healthy percentage of the country's 96,000 or so small shopkeepers do not feel much like harmonizing, especially not with the Germans and the French.</p>
        <p>''When you've been through the war, you don't want French people telling you what to do,'' said Muriel Kemp, 78, defiantly buying half a pound of liver at Mr. Fletcher's shop. ''I think we're quite all right on our own.''</p>
        <p>It is impossible to say exactly how many shopkeepers have refused to go metric, but Donna Webb, a spokeswoman for the U.K. Weighing Federation, which represents scale manufacturers, estimates that some 30,000 small shopkeepers have not replaced or converted their imperial-measurement scales.</p>
        <p>Ms. Webb lays much of the blame on what she called ''this little problem we're having with the U.K. Independence Party.''</p>
        <p>The Independence Party has three members in the European Parliament, whose dedication to persuading Britain to leave the European Union tends to leave them eating alone when everyone breaks for lunch. But while they have had trouble engaging the public's imagination in many cases -- it is hard to explain abstruse European regulations to ordinary Britons and expect them to remain alert -- they have had no such problem with the metric issue.</p>
        <p>''Up to now, the English have gone along with the European stuff, allowing these kinds of idiocies to mount,'' said Tony Bennett, who is running the party's anti-metrification campaign. ''Finally it's gotten to be too much.''</p>
        <p>Britain's populist, vehemently anti-Europe press has weighed in too. The Sun, which uses the word Eurocrat the way others might use the word Nazi, has started a ''Save Our Scales'' campaign in which it is regularly features small shopkeepers who have run afoul of the metrification program.</p>
        <p>Not to be outshone, The Daily Mail, which has long enjoyed printing articles about how Brussels is supposedly forcing Britain to give up things like its traditional toilets (in fact, the toilets are safe), has named its first ''metric martyr.''</p>
        <p>He is Steven Thoburn, a greengrocer who achieved a degree of fame in the Southwick Market in Sunderland when local officials came in and noisily confiscated his imperial scales.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Thoburn faces a $7,500 fine and the destruction of his scales, in other parts of the country shopkeepers have gotten off with warnings. The disparity reflects widespread confusion among local governments, which are supposed to be enforcing the law.</p>
        <p>''It's a battle between central government and local government,'' said Vivian Linacre, director of the British Weights and Measures Association, which maintains that the British metrification law is not legally binding. ''Brussels said to Westminster, 'This is the law -- now you've got to enforce it.' Westminister said to the local government, 'This is the law -- now you've got to enforce it.' ''</p>
        <p>All this puts the country's 2,500 Trading Standards officers in an awkward position indeed.</p>
        <p>''I have every sympathy with the government,'' said Alan Charlesworth, chief executive of the Trading Standards Institute, which helps the Trading Standards officers negotiate the vicissitudes of their jobs. ''We're harmonizing with Europe and we've been subject to a lot of directives, and we're doing our best to comply. For people in the business profession to say that metrification suddenly happened -- they must have been on another planet or buried in the sand.''</p>
        <p>Still, it is perfectly understandable that his members do not much want to go door to door threatening people with jail for the crime of selling half a pound of jelly beans.</p>
        <p>''It's not for the offices of various local authorities to get involved in all that,'' Mr. Charlesworth said. ''But we've gone through a process of education, and the next step of issuing warning notices, and there comes a stage where you've got to say, O.K., if you're flouting the law, then you need to comply.''</p>
        <p>Where does this leave Mr. Fletcher and his scales? He was willing to go metric, Mr. Fletcher said -- he had even bought a new set of scales, for $450 -- until the local government so insulted him that he changed his mind.</p>
        <p>His customers like the old way too. ''If people want to sell in pounds and ounces, why shouldn't they?'' said Chris Hartley, 32, pointing out that Americans do not much want to use the metric system either, no matter what their politicians say. ''It's not as if it's an obscure system of weighing things.''</p>
