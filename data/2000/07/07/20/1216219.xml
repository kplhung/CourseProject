        <p>The Bolshoi Ballet has returned to New York after an absence of 10 years, the same but different. Except for Nina Ananiashvili, who may never have been better than she was in Vladimir Vasiliev's superbly danced new staging of ''Giselle'' on Tuesday night, the current principals are unfamiliar to local audiences.</p>
        <p>Yet for all their Western look, the dancers had the old Bolshoi verve, invigorated by the coherent style seen last month during the company's five-city national tour. New York will not see the Bolshoi's scintillating performances of ''Don Quixote,'' as those cities did. But even the brief run the Lincoln Center Festival 2000 is presenting, with two programs through Sunday (the second is a mixed bill), is better than none.</p>
        <p>By any cultural standard the return of the Bolshoi, which made its historic New York debut in 1959, is a major event. The engagement is sold out: the company's mystique remains intact. It is no secret, however, that the Bolshoi has had its ups and downs. Not only do aesthetics change, but reality intrudes as well. More than 20 years of turmoil within the company, a turnover in directors and an adjustment to a society itself in turmoil will take its toll.</p>
        <p>Yet the metaphor for the Bolshoi Ballet today could well be the theme of ''Giselle'': remorse and regeneration. There is obviously a spirited effort to pull the company together. This ''Giselle'' is persuasive, although not profound. At this performance, it was difficult to be moved but easy to be dazzled by the excellence of the dancing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasiliev, 60, was appointed in 1995 to a new double post as artistic director and general director of the entire Bolshoi Theater, which includes the opera and ballet troupes. Aleksei Fadeyechev, 40, was named artistic director of the ballet company in 1998.</p>
        <p>Neither will claim that the company's dramatic profundity and bravura still exist as they did when Mr. Vasiliev and his wife, Yekaterina Maksimova, danced alongside great stars like Galina Ulanova, Maya Plisetskaya and Nikolai Fadeyechev, Aleksei Fadeyechev's father. But in 1975, when the Bolshoi presented Leonid Lavrovsky's landmark 1944 production of ''Giselle'' in New York, the full passion of the Bolshoi's traditional mix of realism and romanticism could still explode from the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasiliev's new staging (1997) is a surprise. Where one could expect the robust realism he  expressed so brilliantly while performing the Lavrovsky ''Giselle,'' there is an emphasis on dance rather than characterization.</p>
        <p>The entire production has a point of view, which the eroded ''Giselle'' of the Kirov did not have here last year. Nonetheless, dramatic motivation is not given free rein in this version.</p>
        <p>But Giselle's mime is retained, and Ms. Ananiashvili was especially vibrant, playful and childlike in Act I, while vigorous as a Wili, or ghost, in Act II. Her big solo, usually danced earlier in the same act, was here danced for Bathilde, the fiancee of Albrecht, the aristocrat who seduces Giselle. Rarely has technique been as flawless in this solo, complete with full double turns in attitude and strong hops on toe. Ms. Ananiashvili's beautiful arabesques in Act II were clearly etched upon the eye.</p>
        <p>More than strong support in Act II came from the Queen of the Wilis, the young Maria Alexandrova, a statuesque dancer in the grand, expressive Bolshoi style, with a contemporary sleekness. She was stern but exciting.</p>
        <p>The Bolshoi corps of Wilis had an admirable discipline, and yet the contrast between the second act and the first was deliberately muted. Here, Mr. Vasiliev is on risky ground.</p>
        <p>The essence of a Romantic ballet like ''Giselle'' is the dichotomy  between its realistic first act and the supernatural world of its second act. But Mr. Vasiliev opts to unite both as a fantasy expressed through the decor. The main innovation in Sergei Barkhin's set is a tasseled curtain that blends into the sepia landscape of Act I and the foliage of Act II. Nonetheless, the scenery works on its own terms; this is not true of the overwrought costumes by the French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy. The squire, in Act I, looks like a fugitive from a Shriners' convention and wears a peacock feather in his fez.</p>
        <p>With an emphasis on dancing rather than mime, and a swift tempo kept up in the pit by the conductor Alexander Sotnikov, there is little room to delineate a character fully. Sergei Filin, as Albrecht, was neither a cad nor a tender lover. He was, above all, a fine classical dancer (three double turns in the air with arms up, landing in the right position). One never found out what was behind his cardboard facade.</p>
        <p>One reason is that Mr. Vasiliev shifts his focus to Hilarion, the gamekeeper who is a rival for Giselle's love. Lavrovsky injected a dose of class drama, making this potential villain into a good man because he was a man of the people. But in this version, Hilarion is like Albrecht, neither good nor bad. When he should be brooding, he bursts into exuberant bravura. The new choreography for him was executed with demi-caractere polish by Aleksander Petukhov.</p>
        <p>Hilarion is not Rothbart, the evil magician in ''Swan Lake.'' To give him as much time as Giselle and Albrecht is to detract from the essence of ''Giselle.'' Choreographically, it is a ballerina's ballet in true 19th-century Romantic style. But the narrative concerns the epitome of the Romantic hero, the man who sins and undergoes spiritual regeneration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vasiliev wanted to give Giselle a choice of two suitors. But the point is that they are not equal: the Romantic hero is Albrecht, because he sins knowingly, while Hilarion does not.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Vasiliev's choreographic additions, especially a classical showcase for four couples in place of the Peasant Pas de Deux, have a vibrant polish. In the end, wonderful dancing carries the day.</p>
