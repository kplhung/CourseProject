        <p>Asserting that boxing is a ''dying sport that has lost the trust of people,'' the prosecution in the federal racketeering and bribery trial of the president and founder of the International Boxing Federation today laid much of the blame for that state of affairs on a scheme of bribes in exchange for favorable rankings and matchups that the defendants are accused of running.</p>
        <p>In a daylong summation of the prosecution case, the assistant United States Attorney Marc A. Agnifilo painstakingly sketched out the details of the 32-count indictment against Robert W. Lee Sr., 66, the president of the I.B.F., and his son, Robert F. Lee Jr., 38, who served as liaison to his father.</p>
        <p>The Lees are accused of extorting $338,000 over 15 years from managers, promoters and fighters in exchange for rankings and sanctioning that were crucial to boxers getting shots at lucrative televised championship bouts.</p>
        <p>Agnifilo said that in each of the alleged bribes, the pattern was the same, with the elder Lee using go-betweens to arrange and collect the money and then launder it so he would never be ''at the messy place'' where it all took place.</p>
        <p>''But there's no doubt who is in charge of this organization,'' Agnifilo said. ''It's Bob Lee Sr. He runs the I.B.F., and particularly the criminal acts of the I.B.F.''</p>
        <p>While highlighting the strengths of the prosecution case, Agnifilo also tried to shore up its weaker points: the absence of direct testimony that Lee or his son solicited or accepted payments. Much of the evidence linking them to payments from promoters, managers and fighters was provided by Colin Douglas Beavers, a former rankings committee chairman of the I.B.F., based in East Orange, N.J.</p>
        <p>Beavers cooperated with the prosecution, secretly videotaped and audiotaped conversations and testified that he was a bagman for the Lees.</p>
        <p>Agnifilo reviewed many of those taped conversations, culling excerpts of comments by the elder Lee which, Agnifilo said, incriminated Lee in spite of his tendency to talk guardedly and in a clipped, coded manner. Those excerpts were printed in large type on 10-inch-square placards, which were attached by Velcro strips to an 8-by-4-foot chart that dominated the wall of the courtroom of United States District Judge John W. Bissell.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day there were more than 40 placards arranged like tiles on a Scrabble board.</p>
        <p>The defense summation was expected Thursday, and there was a chance that jurors would begin their deliberations as soon as Monday.</p>
        <p>But even as the trial, which began April 11, was nearing its end, Bissell indicated that he was still considering defense motions that would limit the mail and wire fraud charges that the jury could consider. That part of the government's case pivots on defining a fair ranking by the I.B.F. as a thing of value and a right due to the boxers the organization served. But the judge said he was still researching case law for guidance.</p>
        <p>The case has dealt a blow to boxing and particularly the I.B.F., which became the first private sports organization that the federal government has taken over and monitored under provisions of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>
        <p>Last December, Robert J. Cleary, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, persuaded Bissell to wrest control of the I.B.F. from its leaders and appoint a monitor to oversee it.</p>
        <p>The trial has in addition seen boxing's image tarnished by a parade of promoters including Robert Arum, the powerful owner of Top Rank, and Cedric Kushner, who have testified to paying bribes to Lee and the I.B.F. and who could eventually face prosecution.</p>
