        <p>The families of three victims of the shootings last year at Columbine High School have sued the school principal, teachers and a security guard, charging that they knew the two killers' propensity for violence and took no steps to intercede.</p>
        <p>Had those school officials taken action, the families said in complaints filed on Monday with the Jefferson County District Court, the killings of 12 students and a teacher and the wounding of 23 others might never have happened. The lawsuits expanded complaints previously filed by the families against members of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.</p>
        <p>''There was an awful lot of information that was made available by these perpetrators,'' James A. Cederberg, a lawyer representing one of the families, said, referring to the gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. ''At some point, the message has got to be received. These kids were up to something that was a threat to everybody else at school. So how could it all have fallen through the cracks?''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Jefferson County School District said none of the Columbine employees, including the principal, Frank DeAngelis, knew beforehand  ''about the horrible plans or the tragic actions'' of April 20, 1999. The spokesman, Rick Kaufman, described the officials named in the lawsuits as ''dedicated staff members who have demonstrated time and again their commitment to the care, safety and well-being of students and staff.''</p>
        <p>The complaints charge that the two killers provided more than casual evidence of their interest in violence. They also charge that a sheriff's report discussing Mr. Harris's Web site, on which he wrote about bomb making and threats of violence, had been sent to Neil Gardner, a deputy assigned to Columbine as a security officer, but that Mr. Gardner, who was also named as a defendant, took no action.</p>
