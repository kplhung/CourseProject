        <p>Svetlana Broz stands out in the lobby of Sarajevo's hotel, an elegant blond woman out of place amid the men in suits, members of the hard-line nationalist Croatian party who are here for a conference.</p>
        <p>Few appear to recognize her, but they would instantly recognize her name, for everyone in the former Yugoslavia knows her grandfather, Josip Broz, who as Tito was the Communist leader of Yugoslavia for 35 years, from the end of World War II until his death in 1980.</p>
        <p>Ms. Broz, a confident, educated woman of 45, a cardiologist and a divorced mother of two, grew up in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, and worked at the Military Medical Academy. But in 1993, when war was tearing Bosnia apart, she began a personal crusade against the nationalism that has destroyed the country her grandfather created.</p>
        <p>She left her home in Belgrade, and with her teenage daughter drove into Bosnia to offer her services in hospitals and clinics in the Serb-controlled areas. ''I went because I refused to accept the indifference in Belgrade to what was happening in Bosnia, and because I could not accept that the Bosnians were another people,'' she said in an interview. ''The people in Bosnia-Herzegovina were my people, and I had to do something.''</p>
        <p>Some days she would treat up to 100 people in a day, and she found that many of her patients wanted to tell her stories, not so much of the horrors they had experienced but of the gestures of goodness from people who were often on opposing sides in the war. These were tales little broadcast at the time, mainly because the media of all sides were so nationalistic, but also because even small deeds that could be construed as helpful to one's ethnic foes put good Samaritans in danger.</p>
        <p>''So for some moments I put away my cardiological instruments and took up my dictaphone, and I started collecting stories,'' she said. ''I started in 1993 at the most aggressive time when people were killing each other, yet people were prepared to talk of goodness.''</p>
        <p>She published the stories in a book, ''Dobri Ljudi u Vremenu Zla'' (Good People in Times of Evil), printed in the town of Banja Luka in Bosnia's Serbian entity in 1999. Already on its second print run of 5,000, it tells stories of the war from Serbs, Croats and Muslims equally. It remains unavailable in Serbia and Croatia, although she plans readings in Croatian resorts this summer.</p>
        <p>A Croatian doctor helps Muslim prisoners of his own army, and later has to flee when Muslims overrun his town. A Serbian taxi driver in Sarajevo risks his life to ferry people around and bring food to those living under the siege by Serbian forces. The mixed village where Serbian and Muslim neighbors protected each other, as they did in World War II, and survived unscathed.</p>
        <p>''It shows a message, that even in the worst period, every individual could make a choice and that there were a lot of people who remained human in such a time,'' Ms. Broz said. ''People paid with their lives but did not accept the brutal behavior of their own nation.''</p>
        <p>Now living in Sarajevo and working on another book, this one about mixed marriages that still occurred during the war, Ms. Broz said she wanted to create a park in the Bosnian capital, once famed for its multiethnic diversity. Inspired by the Yad Vashem park in Jerusalem, this one would be dedicated to unsung heroes of the war, those who risked their lives to help people from the opposing side.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Broz, the issue is fundamental. She acknowledges with a smile that she has no place to call home and is hard put to say which country she is from. Her father, Zarko Broz, was the eldest surviving son of Tito's first marriage to the Russian Pelagia Belousova, whom he met in Siberia during World War I. Tito himself was half Croatian and half Slovenian.</p>
        <p>Her father fought in Russia in World War II, lost his right arm defending Moscow, and then came to Belgrade the day after it was liberated from Nazi forces in 1944. He accompanied his father to meetings with Churchill. He then joined the Yugoslav Interior Ministry, where he worked for the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Broz was the only child of his third marriage to a Czech doctor whose family originally came from Bosnia. ''My answer is I am a cosmopolitan, and I call myself European since Yugoslavia disappeared,'' she said. She added that she feels no affinity to today's Yugoslavia -- consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, and ruled by Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>''Emotionally and psychologically the whole of the former territory of Yugoslavia is my country, and no one can take that away from me, however many borders they put up in between,'' she said. She still has her home in Belgrade, and both her children are studying there, but she is now building a house on land that belongs to her mother's family, in Hadzici, a village 12 miles outside Sarajevo where she often spent holidays as a child.</p>
        <p>Like many people of her generation, she looks back on the years before war destroyed the old Yugoslavia as halcyon days of harmony and prosperity, and she gives the credit to her grandfather, Tito. ''I lived for 35 years in a country that was magical,'' she said. ''So I believe in what I think was fundamental to his policies, that was living together.''</p>
        <p>She rejects the argument that the Communist slogans of brotherhood and unity were false or that suppressing ethnic differences prepared the ground for a nationalist explosion. She attributes the wars of the last decade rather to the calculated moves by politicians who used nationalism to break up the country.</p>
        <p>She does, however, condemn the suppression of political freedom under Tito, who killed and imprisoned opponents and stamped out even slight expressions of what was deemed to be nationalism. As a democrat, Ms. Broz said, she cannot agree with the persecution of people for their ideas. Yet in the same breath, she wondered if it would not have been better if some dissidents, who became leading nationalist politicians, had remained in prison. ''I am against political persecution, but when you look back, you can see that those people led to the evil that happened,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She retains her harshest words for the intellectuals of Yugoslavia and members of her own medical profession who joined and even led the nationalist charge, like the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, a former psychiatrist.</p>
        <p>She described a dangerous confrontation during the Bosnian war with one of Dr. Karadzic's close associates, the head doctor of a hospital who ordered her arrest.</p>
        <p>''He said I should write about the evil, not the good,'' she said. ''He said there was no good Croat except a dead Croat, and no good Muslim except a dead one. I told him he was inhuman and a fascist, and I was ashamed to be carrying the same diploma as him -- we graduated from the same medical school.''</p>
        <p>When a warrant went out for her arrest, she turned herself in, but the policeman told her to carry on working. ''It showed a policeman wasn't as bad as a doctor,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She rules out a life in politics for herself. ''I am a humanist, and my profession is completely different from politics,'' she said. ''And anyway, there has been enough of that in my family.''</p>
