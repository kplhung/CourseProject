        <p>Either Tiger Woods will win the career Grand Slam, or someone else will have a grand weekend.</p>
        <p>When the British Open begins Thursday, Woods will chase history, trying to become the youngest player, at 24, to win all four majors. But there are other reasons the 2000 British Open is certain to be remembered. Jack Nicklaus, at 60, could be playing his last Open, and he is probably competing in his last tournament at one of golf's most treasured sites, the Old Course at St. Andrews.</p>
        <p>Woods, Nicklaus, nostalgia and a world-class field at St. Andrews -- a blend certain to produce excitement. While Woods enters the tournament as the clear-cut favorite, how can anyone be certain what will happen? Who expected Paul Lawrie to win last year at Carnoustie, Scotland? And who can predict how players will react to the changes at St. Andrews, including rock-hard fairways that are faster than some greens and refaced bunkers that can take several strokes to escape?</p>
        <p>On the eve of the Open, some of the world's best players can be grouped into two categories -- those who are in a groove and those with something to prove. Meanwhile, beware of long shots, like Lawrie last year, who could make a surprise move.</p>
        <p>Of those who are in a groove, Woods, Ernie Els, Lee Westwood and Notah Begay III head the list.</p>
        <p>Woods has won 14 of his last 26 starts worldwide, and he won the United States Open last month by a record-setting 15 strokes. Woods is a presence, not only on the course, but inside the heads of his competitors. He tees off at 9:20 a.m. local time, and almost everyone else in the clubhouse will be tracking his score.</p>
        <p>If Woods opens with a 65 or better, and if he putts well early, some of his competitors will be demoralized. But if Woods struggles in the first round, as he did at the Masters this year when Vijay Singh won, the tournament will suddenly feel much more wide open.</p>
        <p>''He did not win the Western Open a couple of weeks ago,'' Westwood said. ''He is clearly the best player in the world. He is not going to win every week.''</p>
        <p>Westwood is Europe's most torrid player, winning two consecutive starts and three of his last six. But Westwood only has one top-five finish in a major, and he does not care for St. Andrews. Yet, after taking last week off, Westwood felt well rested and confident.</p>
        <p>''The last two tournaments have been wins, so results-wise, it could not be much better,'' Westwood said. ''Stay out of the bunkers. That will be the main point this week.''</p>
        <p>After Woods, Els is the player being mentioned most often as the next favorite. Els has finished second this year at both the Masters and the United States Open. He has won the United States Open twice, and he is not intimidated by Woods.</p>
        <p>''I think Ernie Els is going to win the tournament,'' said Gary Player, who will be playing in his 45th British Open.</p>
        <p>Begay has won his last two starts -- the FedEx St. Jude Classic and the Canon Greater Hartford Open. But Woods did not play in either of those events. And Begay is playing in his first British Open.</p>
        <p>The list of those with something to prove is headed by five players ranked among the world's top 10 -- David Duval, Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III and Jesper Parnevik. Duval, Mickelson, Montgomerie and Parnevik have never won a major, while Love has not won any event in more than two years.</p>
        <p>Duval, who has not won anywhere since April of last year, will have to improve his putting and bunker play to contend this week. But he is still a great driver of the ball and he insists he has not lost confidence.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I've gone backward,'' Duval said. ''Truthfully, I think I'm better. The putting has been lacking.''</p>
        <p>Montgomerie, a native of Scotland, seems to put even more pressure on himself when the Open is in his homeland. But it may help that with Woods, Els and Westwood playing so well, Montgomerie enters this event far from the main attraction.</p>
        <p>''This year, the weight of expectation is not so great,'' Montgomerie said. ''I believe I am more relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Mickelson turned 30 last month, so there is a sense of urgency to win a major. Parnevik, who has three top-four finishes at the Open, is 35 and still has not won a major.</p>
        <p>Love, who won the 1997 P.G.A. Championship, has been a poor Sunday player recently, doing what it takes to finish second, not first. Love has six top-five finishes this year, but no victories.</p>
        <p>Among the long shots to watch are: Loren Roberts, who won at Milwaukee on Sunday, finished third at the Masters and eighth at the United States Open; Padraig Harrington, who tied for fifth at the 1997 British Open and also tied for fifth at this year's United States Open; and John Huston, who finished fourth at the United States Open and tied for fifth at the Masters.</p>
        <p>But as the tournament begins, Woods is in a familiar position -- the focus of attention, with his mind focused on winning. One day, Woods expects to complete the career Grand Slam. And he hopes that day is Sunday.</p>
        <p>''If there are any two tournaments you want to win, it's the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and the British at St. Andrews,'' Woods said. ''I get the chance to complete the slam on the most historic golf course ever designed. It's just a wonderful opportunity.''</p>
