        <p>The beauty of a diverse and multifaceted festival is that little connections pop up, too modest to qualify as full-blown themes and surely not planned as such. Two such connections arose on Tuesday evening, when Lincoln Center Festival 2000 introduced its three-part Meredith Monk retrospective, Voice Travel, featuring Ms. Monk as composer and conductor, with ''Solo Landscapes,'' a program at the New York Society for Ethical Culture.</p>
        <p>The first half consisted of unaccompanied songs, chiefly ''Songs From the Hill,'' 11 pieces from 1976 inspired by the landscape and lore of New Mexico. These are vocal utterances in Ms. Monk's patented style, virtually devoid of intelligible words and made of shaped syllables, plosives, hums, even mere breaths.</p>

        <p>The beauty of a diverse and multifaceted festival is that little connections pop up, too modest to qualify as full-blown themes and surely not planned as such. Two such connections arose on Tuesday evening, when Lincoln Center Festival 2000 introduced its three-part Meredith Monk retrospective, Voice Travel, featuring Ms. Monk as composer and conductor, with ''Solo Landscapes,'' a program at the New York Society for Ethical Culture.</p>
        <p>The first half consisted of unaccompanied songs, chiefly ''Songs From the Hill,'' 11 pieces from 1976 inspired by the landscape and lore of New Mexico. These are vocal utterances in Ms. Monk's patented style, virtually devoid of intelligible words and made of shaped syllables, plosives, hums, even mere breaths.</p>
        <p>In the sixth song, ''Silo,'' Ms. Monk's amazingly flexible voice took on the color and disembodied wail long associated with electronic music; the piece would hardly have seemed out of place in the festival's Electronic Evolution series, just ended. In the eighth song, ''Bird Code,'' Ms. Monk played a big, squawking specimen; the piece seemed an odd deviation from all the bird song (mostly, more cultivated) being heard in the festival's series devoted to music of Messiaen, which ends tomorrow.</p>
        <p>With the range of sounds Ms. Monk can produce, she probably could have connected just as well to any other music the festival might have put forward. (As it is, a listener who missed the opera ''Writing to Vermeer'' can only guess how Ms. Monk's flirtations with Minimalism in ensemble works still to be heard may relate to Louis Andriessen's there.) The songs also conjured bugs (croaking or quirkily singing), old women and ghosts, depicted in all manner of articulation. In the last song, ''Jew's Harp,'' Ms. Monk proved a virtuoso on that mouthful of an instrument, even singing along.</p>
        <p>The second half of the program added piano. Ms. Monk accompanied herself in rudimentary fashion in more or less similar songs or was accompanied by Nurrit Tilles in bigger songs, ending with the most recent, ''New York Requiem,'' a tribute to AIDS victims, from 1993. Ms. Tilles also played the ''St. Petersburg Waltz,'' a piano solo of 1994.</p>
        <p>Ms. Monk everywhere impressed with her versatility and imagination if not always with terseness and economy. In the end it all seemed a bit much of the same thing.</p>
        <p>What today seems remarkable about the early works (''Porch,'' from 1969, and the songs of the 70's), at a time when ''avant-garde'' has become synonymous with ''edge,'' is their consistent sweetness and innocence. In quantity they occasionally cloy (especially, for a listener allergic to cats, in the meowing).</p>
        <p>More varied angles on Ms. Monk's music are promised in the remaining programs: ''Expeditions in Concert,'' with chamber orchestra, tomorrow at Alice Tully Hall, and ''Monk Perspectives,'' with film, on Sunday at La Guardia High School. And keep an ear out for others of those little connections.</p>
