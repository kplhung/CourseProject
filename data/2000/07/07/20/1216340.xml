        <p>Motorola is asking the three agencies that handle its advertising duties, with combined billings estimated at $150 million, for ideas that could be used for a global brand strategy.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Weyrauch, a spokeswoman for Motorola in Schaumburg, Ill., said the company was ''working with our three current agencies to determine the best way to leverage the Motorola brand.''</p>
        <p>Those roster shops are: McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which has handled Motorola's consumer advertising since 1997; Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the Leo Burnett Worldwide unit of the B Com3 Group, which has handled semiconductor products since 1997; and Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, which has handled interactive duties through its Ogilvy One unit since this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weyrauch declined to discuss whether Motorola was considering consolidating the account at a single agency; the daily fax edition of Advertising Age reported that a consolidation was likely.</p>
        <p>Currently, McCann-Erickson handles the bulk of the account; spending for consumer advertising is estimated at $100 million.</p>
