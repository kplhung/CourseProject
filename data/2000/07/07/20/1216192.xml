        <p>I AM not a cheater by nature, but when my life depended on it, for the 20th time, I caved in. I cheated. The game that caused me to cross over to the dark side was the aptly named Perfect Dark, for the Nintendo 64.</p>
        <p>I had fairly, honestly and exhaustedly reached the final level, where my alter ego, Joanna Dark, was instructed to blow up an alien temple's target system, activate an access bridge and assassinate the diabolical space invader responsible for wreaking so much interplanetary havoc.</p>
        <p>Easier said than done. After multiple defeats at the scabrous claws of the so-called final boss, I gave in. I used a Game Shark, a piece of hardware the size of a Nintendo 64 cartridge that plugs into the cartridge port on the top of the console.</p>
        <p>The device lets players choose built-in codes that give them special powers on existing games or add codes for new games, using the controller pad to tap in alphanumeric sequences that can be saved to the console's memory.</p>
        <p>The cheat I used fooled Perfect Dark into believing I had played the game all the way through, which unlocked the elusive infinite life code. I took out not only the big boss, but also his minions, with nary a virtual scratch.</p>
        <p>After it was over, my feelings were mixed. I felt both good and bad. But mostly, I felt guilty. Or, as the game itself, which recognizes whether you played honestly or whether you cheated, reports in the final level's summary screen: ''Disgraced.''</p>
        <p>Cheating is not new. Programmers have always built in ways to cheat because testers need to play every level hundreds of times to make sure the game works.</p>
        <p>With so many variables besides just beating the bad guys -- level design, conversations with other characters, how the bullet holes look when they pierce the wall --  testers install cheats that allow them to bypass certain phases. The programmers sometimes leave the cheats in the finished game or forget to take them out.</p>
        <p>The cheats are not always easy to discover. So many gaming sites and magazines try to cull cheats from inside sources and beta testers, or by experimenting with games.  Many video games have basic cheats that can be activated, without a Game Shark, by pressing an often thumb-numbing series of buttons on the console's controller.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a cheat involves nothing more than typing in a secret password to a certain level, instead of the password the game gives you after completing the level fairly. In either case, once the cheat or cheats are in place, the game becomes easier to play, whether it is because you have better and stronger weapons and ammunition or, in the case of Perfect Dark, unlimited life.</p>
        <p>Unlike other games, Perfect Dark assigns the ''Disgraced'' status to make sure you do not forget that while you may have conquered the level, you went about it dishonestly, according to the game's code of ethics.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the subject of video game cheats, for me and other gamers discussing them online, seems frequently to revolve around the issue of saving games.</p>
        <p>Unlike PC games, which often let you save your game at any point, video games, also called console games, do not.</p>
        <p>So in games like Perfect Dark, dying means you must start the level over. But in games like Unreal and Quake II for the PC, you can save your game as you go, and should you get mowed down around the next turn, you can return to the spot you saved.</p>
        <p>But that has been changing. Last year when Fox Interactive released Alien vs. Predator for the PC, players cried foul when they discovered that the game could be saved only after completing a level.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, the company released a fix that allowed limited saves. The recently released PC shooter game Soldier of Fortune offers the best of both worlds: an easy setting, for unlimited saves at any time in a level, or a more difficult setting that  limits the number of saves per level.</p>
        <p>Another game, Daikatana for Windows PC's, takes a slightly different approach, by requiring the player to collect ''save crystals'' to save the game's progress. The catch is that only three save crystals can be carried at a time.</p>
        <p>Players can get around some of the game's challenges by activating many of its not-so-secret cheats, revealed on popular gaming sites like Gamespot.com and DailyRadar.com. The most common cheat for shooter games is the so-called god cheat, which, as in Daikatana, makes your alter ego invincible.</p>
        <p>I'm not into playing god; I only want to be able to save at any point. So it's only a matter of time before Daikatana's maker  presumably releases a patch that lets a player do that. Even so, since Daikatana has received several scathing reviews, it is not likely to make a difference.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a game is so good -- and available only for video game consoles -- that it is worth playing, despite the many deaths you'll suffer.</p>
        <p>Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation is one. A spy game in which stealth is always preferred to shooting, the game casts the player into the role of a secret agent with a mandate to, what else, save the world. Considered ancient in video game years (it was released in 1998), the game continues to appeal to PlayStation users.</p>
        <p>As with Perfect Dark, Metal Gear Solid's inability to save the game at any point can be frustrating. So a little cheating to slip on a bulletproof vest and load up with unlimited ammunition got me through a few levels.</p>
        <p>But then I stopped cheating and put the game aside because a more appealing alternative is waiting: a higher-resolution version of the game for Windows that will be published this summer by Microsoft. It will let you save the game anywhere.</p>
        <p>Will I ever cheat again? I'm sure I will, as long as the game doesn't allow me to save at  any time. I'd rather live (infinitely) as a disgraced agent than forever die trying.</p>
