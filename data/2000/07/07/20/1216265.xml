        <p>The MetroStars and Lothar Matthaus have apparently come to the realization they need each other. The team wants a marquee player as it contends for the Major League Soccer title, and the proud Matthaus wants to finish his career on a high note rather than in disgrace.</p>
        <p>As of this evening, the 39-year-old Matthaus, who has played more international games than any man in soccer, was a member of the MetroStars and he could be practicing with the team before the weekend. Do not look for Matthaus to play, though, for at least two weeks.</p>
        <p>Matthaus met late Tuesday night in Midtown Manhattan with General Manager Nick Sakiewicz, Coach Octavio Zambrano and Ivan Gazidis, the league's executive vice president, to discuss his back injury and his status. All parties agreed they have the same goal.</p>
        <p>Zambrano said Matthaus told them that his back was feeling better. He has started to jog, but he cannot sprint. Matthaus did not take part in today's practice at the MetroStars' training facility here at Kean University.</p>
        <p>Zambrano said after practice that Matthaus explained the sequence of events about his injury and his presence in St. Tropez, France, earlier this month when he should have been rehabilitating. Sakiewicz and Zambrano told Matthaus what they expected of him.</p>
        <p>''We've said our piece,'' Zambrano said. ''Now, the ball is in his court. He has to prove to us that he has the desire to help us. No one questions his ability. He's a marquee player, and a marquee player can help a team accomplish big things.''</p>
        <p>Sakiewicz said Matthaus was not guaranteed a starting position on the team upon his return, and that the team had developed good chemistry without him.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars have gone from worst to best in the league without Matthaus. They were 3-6-1 with him and are 9-1-1 without him, but Zambrano still feels the presence of Matthaus is necessary for success.</p>
        <p>''A healthy Lothar is a good Lothar,'' said Mark Chung, one of Matthaus's critics, ''and I think we'll go all the way.''</p>
