        <p>The discussion inadvertently sent Bernie Williams time traveling, causing him to recall what it was like to be an uncertain rookie with the Yankees nine years ago.

        <p>The discussion inadvertently sent Bernie Williams time traveling, causing him to recall what it was like to be an uncertain rookie with the Yankees nine years ago. Williams provided the flashbacks, when petty teammates like Mel Hall called him Bambi, when Manager Buck Showalter had him work out with minor leaguers in spring training and when every day could have been his last in the majors. Or at least that is what Williams thought.</p>
        <p>All it took was one mention of the past for Williams to instantly digress and remind himself of the moments when he had doubts. Williams is one of the elite players in baseball, he owns three World Series rings and he has an $87.5 million contract, but he took a few minutes yesterday to ground himself. Remember when?</p>
        <p>''I remember those days,'' Williams said, shaking his head. ''I don't ever want to go back to that. How many people have had great starts and then you never hear about them again?''</p>
        <p>That Williams seized upon the flimsiest of opportunities to recall when he was not an All-Star center fielder is a sign of his humility. But Williams is humble, not dense. He is having another splendid season and knows that he is a prime candidate for the American League's most valuable player award. Discussing it makes him uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>''Don't get me wrong, it would be great to have one of those in your trophy case,'' he said. ''It's one of those things you dream about. The attitude here is team-oriented. That's worked, so I'm not going to change anything.''</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill was more direct about what Williams has meant to the Yankees, who did not need anything from Williams last night to squash the Detroit Tigers, 9-1. ''I'd say that he is as important to us as any other player is to his team in the American League,'' O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>Still, Williams squirmed. Some Yankees have teased him about winning the award because he was batting .335 with 21 homers and 87 runs batted in after going 1 for 2 last night. There is no doubt Williams is improving, but he quickly mentioned other players who are having terrific seasons: Nomar Garciaparra, Carlos Delgado, Darrin Erstad, Frank Thomas, Edgar Martinez.</p>
        <p>But Williams is on pace to drive in 160 runs, so he added, ''If this isn't the year for me to go off like this, I don't know what is.''</p>
        <p>Williams was referring to the explosion of offense in the majors, but he could have also been referring to the aging of the Yankees. While Williams is only 31, the Yankees are growing older around him, and they have sputtered this year as they have not since early 1995.</p>
        <p>O'Neill, the right fielder, is 37, the same age as the pitchers Roger Clemens and David Cone. Maybe, deep down, Williams knows that these Yankees could be approaching their finale.</p>
        <p>He was reflective enough to remember 1991. He is reflective enough to know that winning a third straight title is a gargantuan task. Just getting to the postseason is not guaranteed. ''We've got guys breathing down our necks,'' Williams said. ''We can't really relax.''</p>
        <p>It has been customary to call Derek Jeter the M.V.P. of the Yankees, but Williams is the M.V.P. this year. Even though Williams has won three Gold Gloves, he does not always get good jumps on fly balls, he pulls up on others and he has an average arm. But Williams has not been charged with an error this year, and his offensive output has obscured the listless defense.</p>
        <p>''When we need a big hit, Bernie gets it,'' O'Neill said. ''He's got so much confidence, you know he's going to do it. Without him, our offense would be less than mediocre.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre is enamored of and amused with Williams, who is usually the last Yankee on the field for stretching exercises and the first player to hustle out of the clubhouse after games. After Williams smacked a two-run triple off Curt Schilling in a 3-1 victory over the Phillies on Tuesday night, the only person who asked him about it was a security guard because Williams bolted again.</p>
        <p>Before Clemens faced the Florida Marlins last Friday in a game that was more critical for him than anyone else, Torre told Williams, ''I need you.''</p>
        <p>Williams looked at him and softly said, ''I know.'' Torre loved Williams's response, which was part playful and part serious.</p>
        <p>''They probably think I'm the goofiest player on the team,'' Williams said. ''I'm always giving them weird answers to make them think. But I took what Joe said seriously. It was an important game. I think the whole season will be like that.''</p>
        <p>The goofy, great center fielder is right. This has been an arduous season for the Yankees, and they need a much more stable starting rotation to get them to October. They do not have to worry about Williams, who admitted, ''If I'm not the goofiest one here, I'm one of them.''</p>
        <p>Goofiest? Probably. Most valuable? Definitely.</p>
