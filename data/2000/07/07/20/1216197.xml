        <p>Those who watch golf on television sometimes hear a commentator say, ''If he makes this putt, he will finish third, and it's worth $30,000 to him.'' An exact bridge parallel occurred on a Sunday in May at the Cavendish Pairs in Las Vegas, where the Calcutta pool totaled $1,140,500, to be distributed among the successful players and their backers.</p>
        <p>In the last round Michel Abecassis and Jean-Christophe Quantin of France faced David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen of the United States, with both pairs in contention for the valuable third position. On the crucial deal in the diagram Berkowitz, East, opened two spades. Abecassis, awkwardly placed, ventured two no-trump and played in three no-trump after a transfer response, showing hearts, by Quantin.</p>
        <p>South had eight obvious tricks, and the question was whether he could collect a ninth. The spade 10 was led, and when East covered the jack with the queen, South ducked. East did well to shift to a heart; and after taking three rounds of diamonds, ending in the dummy, South led the heart 10. East won with the jack and shifted to the club queen.</p>
        <p>When South covered with the king, he was permitted to win. That apparently gave the declarer his ninth trick, but the ending was deceptive:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>South had five tricks and seemingly could collect two diamonds, a heart and a spade. But he could not get to all these tricks. He tried cashing the spade ace, the diamond 10 and the diamond five, but that was the end. The defenders discarded their hearts, and Cohen took three club tricks at the finish.</p>
        <p>But consider what would have happened if Abecassis, after cashing the spade ace and throwing a club from dummy, had led the diamond five. This would have abandoned the diamond 10 in the closed hand, but it would have ruined West. He would have had to save two hearts and would then have been endplayed by a club lead.</p>
        <p>Dummy would have scored two heart tricks and the game would have made. ''That missed putt,'' the commentator might have said, ''cost the French players and their backers $37,540.'' They dropped to fifth, and the Americans moved up to third, gaining that amount for themselves and their supporters.</p>
        <p>The bridge column on Saturday misstated East's lead on the second trick. East led the heart eight, not the heart nine, which was in West's hand.</p>
