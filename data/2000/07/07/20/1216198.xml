        <p>OURS is a family besotted with catalogs. But don't get me wrong. We welcome the dozens of catalogs -- J. Jill, Pottery Barn Kids, French Country Living, House and Home, you name it -- that land in our mailbox every day. In fact, one of us, who shall remain unnamed, takes so much pleasure in browsing catalogs that he makes a point of rummaging through recycling bins at the post office for discarded catalogs that direct marketrs failed to send us for some reason.</p>
        <p>But we seldom actually order from catalogs because we know that pictures can, if not lie exactly, then pleasantly distort. On the rare occasions that I break down and buy something from a catalog that is not a tried and true piece of clothing or cookware, I am invariably disappointed, usually by its quality. So more often than not, we simply covet.</p>
        <p>My husband and I share a special longing for rugs. We own very few because we know a good rug when we see it, which invariably means we can't afford it. But this spring we decided to break down and buy an area rug for our living room.</p>
        <p>The rugs we found in the pages of our catalogs were certainly enticing.  But our distrust of the pictures and prices sent us into actual rug stores. We grew depressed as we made our way through the racks of hanging rugs because we couldn't afford the lovely hand-hooked ones and we didn't want the ones made of synthetic fibers. Then one evening, inspiration struck. ''You know, I've seen some beautiful rugs up on the Web,'' my husband said in a casual, steady tone. Eureka!</p>
        <p>The next morning, I went straight to the computer. Rug merchants, it turns out -- perhaps to no one's surprise but my own -- have taken their wares to the Web with a vengeance. I spent an hour clicking my way from area rug to area rug. I found every imaginable size, material, pattern and motif for sale at sites like Area Rugs Unlimited (www.arearugsltd .com) and Area Rugs For Less.com (arearugsforless.com).</p>
        <p>By that evening, I had bookmarked about a dozen rugs, and I showed them to my husband. One,  the Retro-Gold rug from the Vintage collection at AreaFloorRugs.com (areafloorrugs.com), caught his eye. Its squares of muted old-world golds, rusts and blues would be a perfect complement to our newly upholstered couch. The size was perfect. The site told us that we were getting a $675 rug for $385. I ordered it.</p>
        <p>I was thrilled with my smart purchase. I struck up a friendly e-mail exchange with Paul, a customer service agent at AreaFloorRugs.com. Every time I sent him an e-mail message, Paul responded at once. We were headed for vacation and needed to time the shipping of the rug so it didn't arrive while we were away, and Paul went out of his way to accommodate the request. If he was a robot, he was one of the more impressive feats to come out of automated customer service.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Paul's diligence, the rug arrived according to plan a few weeks later. We hauled it up the stairs, ripped through the heavy plastic wrapping and unrolled it.</p>
        <p>What we experienced next is best described as consumer shock. Instead of the subtle hues we anticipated, the colors were closer to neon. A clown lying on our floor would call less attention to himself. The loud colors were only accentuated by the rug's glossy, plasticine look and feel, which was not unlike Astroturf.</p>
        <p>''This is a disaster,'' my husband said, crestfallen.</p>
        <p>I was angry, but not with AreaFloorRugs.com. After all, the site had faithfully described the rug as being of ''super heavy weight, high pile, 100% Continuous-filament, Delustered, Velvet-Set polypropylene to provide years of durable splendor.'' If I had seen ''polypropylene'' buried in the description, I was too seduced by the other words to take much notice. And blame lay with no one but myself for failing to decode ''natural luster'' and ''quaint antique charm.'' AreaFloorRugs.com should give that wordsmith a raise.</p>
        <p>I was angry with myself. I castigated myself for thinking that a digital photograph reproduced on my old computer monitor would be true to the real thing. As anyone who has been around computers for a few years can tell you, colors vary from one computer to the next, as monitors are not calibrated to the same schemes. I knew this. My husband knew this. Why had the healthy skepticism we held for catalogs failed to kick in when we turned to the Web?</p>
        <p>I am not alone when it comes to getting something slightly (or very) different from what I think I have purchased online. One friend recently used an online agency to rent a villa in France, only to arrive and find that the house lacked such basics as a telephone line. And the husband of a colleague told me his story of ordering what he thought was a side table for his office. Instead, he ended up with a miniature version of what he thought he had bought. Still, he kept it. (''It's a designer table, very nice,'' he explained, ''but only 10 inches tall.'')</p>
        <p>But that rug had to go back.</p>
        <p>Paul, meanwhile, was sending me solicitous e-mail notes. Had the rug arrived? Was I happy with it?</p>
        <p>For a few days, I was too mortified to respond. I wanted to spare his feelings. After all he had done to shepherd my order along, the rug seemed as much his as mine. I chose my words carefully: ''The rug arrived. It is a bit disappointing, not what we had envisioned from the photo we saw online.'' I refrained from asking him if he had any idea how hideous this object was. Instead, I inquired politely about the return policy.</p>
        <p>Paul wrote back immediately, of course. He was disappointed by our disappointment. But he minced no words about the return policy. Yes, we could return it, but we would have to pack it up and pay for the shipping. We would also be charged a restocking fee of 15 percent.</p>
        <p>The work that would be required to send back the rug was daunting. I let it slip and grew distracted by other things. We decided to live with the rug, partly because we knew we'd never find the time to return it, partly because we knew it was an object lesson for us about the perils of purchasing items sight unseen on the Net, where it is easy to be completely deceived about scale, color and texture.</p>
        <p>Now, every time we open our front door we are greeted by the sight of our Internet purchase.</p>
        <p>But we've grown used to it. I'm even beginning to like it, to appreciate its finer qualities. When our elderly cat loses her lunch on the rug, for instance, it's like cleaning Teflon. And we've learned our lesson, a lesson that has blurred some distinctions. When I told my husband the other day that I planned to write about the rug, he responded, ''Didn't we buy that from a catalog?''</p>
