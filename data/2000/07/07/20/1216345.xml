        <p>The Mets' bench is largely a collection of players who were never part of the team's original plans.</p>
        <p>Mark Johnson played in Japan last year and signed a minor league contract. The Mets took Joe McEwing from St. Louis when they had to find a place to trade Jesse Orosco. Benny Agbayani, Lenny Harris and Jay Payton were supposed to be reserves but are starting now because of injuries.</p>
        <p>All of those players made important contributions tonight as the Mets beat the Montreal Expos, 5-3, for their third straight victory.</p>
        <p>With one out in the eighth inning, McEwing singled in the tying and go-ahead runs off the Montreal closer Steve Kline, who allowed singles to Payton and Agbayani to start the inning. Agbayani was running from second and saw Harris, the on-deck hitter, standing behind home plate waving for him to slide to the side. Agbayani did, eluding the tag of catcher Chris Widger and tapping the plate with his left hand.</p>
        <p>''Benny made a good turn around third and made the perfect slide at home, touching the plate with his hand,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''You practice that sometimes, and you always wonder if it's going to come in handy. He knew what to do, and he got in there with the big run.''</p>
        <p>McEwing, meanwhile, was upset at himself for not taking second on the throw. Running on his own -- as most Mets do -- he stole second, and was in position to score the Mets' final run on a single by Derek Bell, who also threw out a runner at the plate in the seventh.</p>
        <p>McEwing was batting for Johnson, who had a pinch-hit single in the seventh inning and scored on a triple by Harris. Harris's hit tied the score, 2-2, and though Vladimir Guerrero doubled off Pat Mahomes in the seventh to regain a one-run lead for Montreal, McEwing's heroics gave the Mets the victory.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be prepared and focused for whatever the situation is, and try to take advantage of every opportunity you've got,'' said McEwing, who thought his two-run single was his biggest hit as a Met.</p>
        <p>The clutch hits overshadowed the Mets' other struggles with men on base. They stranded six runners in scoring position, and the Expos' pitching tag team frustrated them.</p>
        <p>Tony Armas Jr., Montreal's scheduled starter, arrived at Olympic Stadium with a strained rotator cuff, and the Expos started Felipe Lira in his place. But Lira is a reliever.</p>
        <p>That forced the Expos to space several relievers. Lira allowed only a homer to Todd Zeile in his three innings, and Scott Strickland came on for two scoreless innings. Anthony Telford, Kline and Guillermo Mota followed.</p>
        <p>''They played it like a spring training game, where every guy pitches a few innings and you get one look per pitcher,'' Valentine said. ''It almost worked.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' starter, Glendon Rusch, worked six innings and allowed two earned runs. He walked three hitters, snapping a streak of 34 1/3 innings without a walk, and he was helped by standout defense from Payton, the center fielder.</p>
        <p>Payton, who had an over-the-shoulder basket catch in the ninth inning of a tie game earlier this week, has impressed the Mets. Payton's speed gives him great range, and his impulse is to try to catch everything.</p>
        <p>Such aggressiveness hurt him in the third inning, when Widger drove a triple past him; Payton said he should have tried to cut the ball off. But in the sixth, Mike Mordecai shot a liner over Payton's head and to his left. He froze for a moment, then hurried back to leap and spear it, the ball peeking out of the webbing of his glove.</p>
        <p>''The fact that it went in my glove was kind of a bonus for me,'' Payton said. ''At the last second, I stuck my glove up and thought, 'Oh well.' ''</p>
        <p>As a control specialist, Rusch wants hitters to put the ball in play. He has every reason to have full confidence in his fielders: in 113 2/3 innings this year, Rusch has not allowed an unearned run.</p>
        <p>''I throw the ball over the plate,'' he said, ''and let the guys do the work for me.''</p>
        <p>Lately, the Mets have been spreading that work around, at the plate and in the field, among starters and reserves.</p>
        <p>As Agbayani said, ''It has to be like that if we want to win.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The left-hander BOBBY M. JONES, who pitched only six innings in more than three weeks with the Mets, was sent to Class AAA Norfolk after blasting Manager BOBBY VALENTINE. Jones was quoted as calling Valentine ''a joke'' and said he was disgusted at his situation. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS called Jones and Valentine to his room at the Mets' hotel in Montreal, and Phillips said Jones acknowledged he made a mistake.</p>
        <p>''Basically we came to the conclusion that he wanted to pitch more and he didn't like being here right now, so we decided to give him an opportunity to pitch more in Norfolk,'' Valentine said. ''I think he was understanding of his misactions.''</p>
        <p>The Mets promoted the right-hander JIM MANN.</p>
        <p>ARMANDO BENITEZ recorded his 22nd save in Wednesday's victory to match a career high.</p>
        <p>Phillips said he never ordered pitcher AL LEITER not to fly on the Yankees' team charter to the All-Star Game the night after ROGER CLEMENS beaned MIKE PIAZZA. ''Consider all the issues,'' Phillips said he told Leiter. ''I'm not making the decision.''</p>
