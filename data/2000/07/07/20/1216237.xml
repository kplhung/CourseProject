        <p>It's the wealthiest families in America, a few thousand, who would benefit most from the estate tax repeal for which the Republican Congress just voted -- with the support of Gov. George W. Bush -- as well as from the massive income tax cut that Mr. Bush has proposed.

        <p>It's the wealthiest families in America, a few thousand, who would benefit most from the estate tax repeal for which the Republican Congress just voted -- with the support of Gov. George W. Bush -- as well as from the massive income tax cut that Mr. Bush has proposed. But is it worth it, given the inevitable public backlash over awarding hundreds of billions of dollars to those who need it the least?</p>
        <p>As a Republican, I ask my party: Is it worth it to be known increasingly as protector of the rich and powerful, despite the appreciative response in campaign contributions?</p>
        <p>The party risks placing itself out of what my uncle, Nelson Rockefeller, called the mainstream. At the 1964 G.O.P. convention, when he was the governor of New York and a presidential candidate, I watched him issue a warning against extremism in the party. ''You may not like to hear it,'' he told the crowd trying to silence him with boos, ''but it's the truth.''</p>
        <p>Today the truth is this: It's out of the mainstream when the Republican Congress fails to protect patients' rights, withholds education funding and makes war on the environment.</p>
        <p>It's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with true Republican principles of fiscal responsibility -- to plunge back into deficit spending, as Governor Bush has in Texas with big tax cuts for the oil industry and others. It's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with traditional Republican standards of liberty -- to put the federal government between a woman and her doctor in matters of reproductive choice, as Governor Bush and the party would try to do by overturning Roe v. Wade. And it's out of the mainstream -- and at odds with Republican preference for government closest to the people -- to override local government efforts to limit sprawl and protect drinking water, as Governor Bush did by veto, or to side with gun makers against local attempts to hold them accountable for harm done.</p>
        <p>It was far from the American mainstream -- and at odds with talk of ''compassion'' -- to withhold medical insurance from 200,000 children, as Mr. Bush did for three years in a state that ranks rock-bottom last in family health coverage; to try to invade teachers' retirement funds; to oppose a hate crimes law even after a black man was dragged to death; and to allow concealed guns to be carried even into church.</p>
        <p>What a contrast with the record and values of progressive Republican governors like New York's Theodore Roosevelt, Nelson Rockefeller and, yes, George Pataki.</p>
        <p>So what's a mainstream Republican to do in this year's elections? Think hard -- and act independently.</p>
