        <p>New software, called Souvenir, creates links between personal computer or handheld organizer and digital audio or video recorder so that user can click onto words to automatically pull up corresponding audio or video clip; software can be downloaded for free at www.i-recall.com (S)</p>

        <p>Note takers, take note: Software is now available for those who are tired of having to fast-forward through audio or video recordings in hope of finding that one significant moment they jotted down in their digital notepads.</p>
        <p>The software, called Souvenir, is designed for students, reporters, lawyers, conference attendees and anyone else who takes notes while recording interviews or lectures. The technology works by issuing a time stamp each time a note is taken and using those time stamps to create links between the jotted words and the digital recording.  When users review the notes later, they only need to click on the words to pull up the corresponding video or audio clip.</p>

        <p>The software, which is available for free downloading until this fall at www.i-recall.com, requires that notes be taken on a digital device like a personal computer or handheld organizer and that the audio or visual recording must be digital, too.</p>
