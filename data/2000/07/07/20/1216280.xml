        <p>An 18-year-old woman was struck in the head yesterday afternoon by a brick from the second floor of a building under renovation on the Lower East Side, Fire Department officials said.</p>
        <p>Chief Steven Kubler, a spokesman for the department, said the woman was struck in the side of her head shortly before 3 p.m. as workers were using a wooden chute to transfer debris from a three-story brick tenement at 126 Rivington Street, between Norfolk and Essex Streets, to a metal container in the street. It was not clear last night whether the woman had been walking on the sidewalk, which is covered by scaffolding, or was using the street to get around the site.</p>

        <p>An 18-year-old woman was struck in the head yesterday afternoon by a brick from the second floor of a building under renovation on the Lower East Side, Fire Department officials said.</p>
        <p>Chief Steven Kubler, a spokesman for the department, said the woman was struck in the side of her head shortly before 3 p.m. as workers were using a wooden chute to transfer debris from a three-story brick tenement at 126 Rivington Street, between Norfolk and Essex Streets, to a metal container in the street. It was not clear last night whether the woman had been walking on the sidewalk, which is covered by scaffolding, or was using the street to get around the site.</p>
        <p>The woman, whose name was not released by fire officials, did not lose consciousness. She was taken to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center, where she was listed in serious but stable condition. A hospital spokeswoman, Jasmin Collazo, said the woman, who had suffered a cut on the right side of her head, was being held for observation.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a man was seriously hurt when a 25-pound stucco ornament fell from the 14th floor of a building at Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street in Manhattan. The man, John Edwards, who was in New York with his wife and two children to attend a religious conference, suffered a fractured skull and underwent brain surgery. A hospital spokesman said last night that Mr. Edwards was in serious but stable condition.</p>
        <p>During the last several weeks, workers had been gutting the building on Rivington Street, which is owned by the Schapiro Wine Company. Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said that the owner had permits for demolition and construction but not for the use of a construction shed or a fence or a chute. Mr. Wein said the department would issue a notice of violations for the use of those items, and would also issue a stop-work order. The Schapiro Wine Company did not return a telephone call for comment.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the incident, dozens of people gathered on the sidewalk across the street from the building.  Curtis Mickle said he had seen the blow.</p>
        <p>''Workers were sending rubbish down the shoot when a brick bounced out and hit the girl,'' Mr. Mickle said. ''She was stunned and bleeding. She didn't fall down, but she was stumbling.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 24, 2000, Monday  An article on Thursday about a woman who was struck by a brick that fell from a building under renovation at 126 Rivington Street, on the Lower East Side, gave an incorrect identification from the Buildings Department for the property's owners. According to the city's Finance Department, the building was transferred on Jan. 21 to a new owner, 126 Rivington Street LLC. It is no longer owned by the Schapiro Wine Company.</p>
