        <p>The Volvo Car Corporation in Goteborg, Sweden, owned by the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday that it had expanded its relationship with Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/Euro RSCG in New York by naming the agency as the lead shop to handle its strategic and creative advertising for Pan-European markets. Billings were estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>Messner Vetere, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, adds the Pan-European duties to the North American Volvo account it already handles, with billings estimated at $100 million. The decision came after an informal three-month review that had been narrowed to Messner Vetere and three other agencies: Leagas Delaney in London; Wieden &amp; Kennedy in London; and 180 in Amsterdam.</p>

        <p>Messner Vetere, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, adds the Pan-European duties to the North American Volvo account it already handles, with billings estimated at $100 million. The decision came after an informal three-month review that had been narrowed to Messner Vetere and three other agencies: Leagas Delaney in London; Wieden &amp; Kennedy in London; and 180 in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Forsman &amp; Bodenfors in Goteborg had handled the Pan-European duties being awarded to Messner Vetere; that agency continues to work for Volvo in the nordic region. The 12 to 15 other agencies handling Volvo duties in individual European countries will continue to do so; for instance, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO in London, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, continues to handle Volvo in Britain.</p>
        <p>To handle the job, Messner Vetere is opening an office in Brussels with 30 employees to be named Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer/FUEL Europe.</p>
