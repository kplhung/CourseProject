        <p>A quarterly loss of more than $1 billion was not enough to scare investors away from the stock of the Bank One Corporation yesterday.</p>
        <p>Instead, they bought shares of the bank, which is based in Chicago, after its new chief executive, James L. Dimon, announced a $1.91 billion restructuring charge that wiped out the company's second-quarter profit and left it with a loss of $1.27 billion, or $1.11 a diluted share. The bank also slashed its dividend in half.</p>
        <p>Though the charge was much bigger than analysts had predicted, Bank One's stock rose $2.625, or 8.8 percent, to $32.625, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 12 million shares of Bank One changed hands, making it one of the most active issues of the day.</p>
        <p>After a briefing by Mr. Dimon, several analysts increased their estimates of the bank's future earnings and some raised their ratings on the stock. Most of them expressed confidence in Mr. Dimon's ability to turn around the troubled bank he took over earlier this year after he was forced out of the No. 2 job at Citigroup.</p>
        <p>But not everybody was convinced. Michael Mayo, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston who has been advising clients to sell Bank One's stock, did not change his rating yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Jamie Dimon gave a good presentation today,'' Mr. Mayo said. ''But you have to realize that this is a battleship to turn around and Jamie Dimon is not Hercules.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mayo raised his estimate of how much Bank One would earn next year by about 4 percent, to $2.90 a share. At yesterday's closing price, that translates to a price-earnings ratio of 11.2.</p>
        <p>The stock of Chase Manhattan, a consistently profitable and growing financial-services company, trades for about the same price-earnings ratio, 11.34. That contrast shows that ''Bank One's gotten a little ahead of itself,'' Mr. Mayo said.</p>
        <p>''What we'd like to see is that the smart ideas that start from the top translate into progress from the business lines,'' he said. ''The best laid plans don't always translate into sustainable earnings growth.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Dimon said he had taken the first step toward a turnaround by writing down the value of some of the bank's assets and setting aside money to cover future losses. Before taxes, the charge amounts to $2.94 billion, with $777 million attributed to the bank's First USA credit card division.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimon said he was ''pretty confident'' that the bank would not have to take more charges to cover the costs of the restructuring, ''but it's not a promise yet.'' He added: ''I've only been here for three or four months. But I really do feel confident that we scrubbed pretty hard.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimon said he did not anticipate having to lay off significant numbers of the bank's 82,500 employees, nor did he intend to sell the credit card business or Wingspan .com, an Internet-based bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimon said the bank would reduce employment mainly through attrition and would focus on reducing nonemployment expenses. He said the bank hoped to cut those costs by about $500 million a year. He also announced plans to conserve cash by cutting the quarterly dividend by 50 percent, to 21 cents a share.</p>
        <p>The bank will try to combine the resources of Wingspan, which it has run as a freestanding unit, with the online operations of Bank One and ''try to grow both of them aggressively,'' Mr. Dimon said. He believes Wingspan ''can be positioned differently'' to take better advantage of Bank One's branch network and other resources, but ''I can't tell you that strategy will definitely work.''</p>
        <p>Sandra Flannigan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, said she had always thought Bank One should hang onto First USA because it was such a big player in the credit card business and because there were synergies between it and the bank's other consumer businesses. ''I think Wingspan is a bigger question mark,'' she said, expressing doubt about the wisdom of having two bank brands on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flannigan, who kept a ''near term neutral'' rating on the stock, said Mr. Dimon and his team had taken steps that should ensure smooth profitability in the short run. ''Certainly big upfront charges have the ability to pave the way for a nice bounce,'' she said. ''But in the long run, can they position this company to be a standout in an industry that is increasingly competitive?''</p>
        <p>Mr. May added: ''They face a long haul in getting there. Investors better be ready for more bumps in the road.''</p>
