        <p>An international organization that seeks compensation for Holocaust survivors said yesterday that it planned to pressure the Austrian government to acknowledge complicity during the Nazi regime and to improve reparations to Jews.</p>
        <p>Sixty delegates at a two-day annual meeting of the Claims Conference in New York voted unanimously to approach the Austrian government with three requests: to acknowledge that it had a role in the Holocaust; to make payments to survivors even before a final accounting report is completed, and to make some sort of restitution for property taken from Jews during World War II.</p>
        <p>''We've solved so many issues except for the Austrian issue that it sticks out like a sore thumb,'' said Israel Singer, chief negotiator for the group. ''This is an obligation on their part.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Claims Conference, which started in the 1950's, distributed $239 million to survivors. The group, officially known as the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, was instrumental in pressuring the German government and companies to create a $5 billion fund for Nazi-era slave laborers and forced laborers. Since its founding, the group has helped to get Germany to set aside $50 billion.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Austria agreed to give 70,000 schillings -- just under $5,000 today -- each to Jews from Austria who survived the war. It is also completing an agreement to make reparations for slave and forced laborers, in exchange for the United States' dropping all lawsuits filed on behalf of those victims. But the Claims Conference said yesterday that it disapproved of that agreement because it did not address the issue of seized property.</p>
        <p>The group estimates that 70,000 apartments and up to 30,000 businesses were taken from Austrian Jews.</p>
        <p>When Germany took over Austria in 1938, scholars say, about 180,000 Jews lived in the country. About 50,000 were sent to concentration camps, mostly in Poland.</p>
        <p>''It is more than a financial problem, it is a psychological problem,'' said Moshe H. Jahoda, the group's representative in Austria. Mr. Jahoda said 23 members of his family were killed in camps, including his parents and younger sister. Their apartment and printing business were taken, he said, and all he has received is the 70,000 schillings.</p>
        <p>George Kilzer, an Austrian consul in New York, said that his government had not heard of yesterday's vote by the Claims Conference. As for the slave labor reparations, he said that ''is more or less settled.''</p>
        <p>Austria has long said it was a victim of German aggression. But the government's agreement in 1990 to pay $200 million in benefits to Jews who suffered there during the Nazi era suggested to some Jewish groups that Austria had begun to accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>In February, Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of Austria sent a letter to Mr. Singer expressing his interest in settling quickly on reparations.</p>
        <p>The next month, Austrian officials appointed a special envoy, Ernst Sucharipa, to negotiate with the Claims Conference on speedier reparations and property restitution.</p>
        <p>So far, representatives from both sides have met only once, indicating Austria's reluctance to negotiate, Mr. Singer said.</p>
        <p>''The Austrians just keep trying to delay the issue,'' Mr. Singer said. ''They just need the willingness to deal with this.''</p>
