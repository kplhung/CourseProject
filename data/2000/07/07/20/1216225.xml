        <p>Re ''Freed Inmates Must Get Care if Mentally Ill'' (news article, July 13):</p>
        <p>It's unfortunate that a court had to impose common sense on the city administration when it comes to the treatment of mentally ill inmates released from the Rikers Island jail. For the last six months, my office has been working on a model for the Bronx that would serve the city administration well: Provide supportive housing placements as part of the discharge plans of mentally ill inmates, and increase coordination between the Department of Correction, the Department of Homeless Services and the Department of Mental Health to ensure that mobile crisis units are aware of the mentally ill inmates being discharged.</p>

        <p>Simple steps like these will keep safe those former inmates who might be a danger to themselves or others.</p>
