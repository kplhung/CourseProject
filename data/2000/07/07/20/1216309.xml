        <p>Seizing what he views as a golden chance to pierce the heart of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, Vice President Al Gore said today that he would ride into Governor Bush's backyard in Texas on Thursday to highlight the state's budget woes.</p>
        <p>The Gore entourage had planned to travel from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, back to Washington, but this morning Mr. Gore announced that he would diverting his campaign to San Antonio Thursday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign can hardly contain its glee over the daily headlines out of Texas describing a budget shortfall and its attendant problems. The Gore campaign can be expected to hit the air with television commercials on the subject soon, and will milk the budget problems for maximum publicity for some time to come, particularly as a competing story line about the Bush campaign in the days leading up to the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''We believe that how the governor runs Texas says important things about how he'd run the country,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani added that the Gore team perceives the Texas budget shortfall as politically devastating for Mr. Bush as the pollution of Boston Harbor was to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts when he ran for president in 1988.</p>
        <p>''It's a surprising weakness,'' Mr. Fabiani said. ''The thing that hurt Governor Dukakis the most is that people thought a Democratic governor ought to be strong on the environment, and when questions were raised about the harbor it undermined one of his strengths. If a Republican governor can't effectively manage his state budget in a period of tremendous prosperity, it is just as bad. This is his Boston Harbor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told reporters tonight that the Boston Harbor comparison ''never crossed my mind.'' But when asked whether he hoped his attacks on Mr. Bush would be as effective as the attacks on Mr. Dukakis, he did not answer directly. Instead, he criticized the administration of Mr. Bush's father, which he said ''squandered'' money on a tax cut that could have been used on a cleanup.</p>
        <p>There is a special irony for the Gore campaign in being able to turn the Boston Harbor strategy so forcefully against Governor Bush since his father, in seeking the presidency in 1988, had turned Boston Harbor into a weapon against Mr. Dukakis.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign has already been using bits of this strategy by pointing to a variety of problems in Texas, but the vice president's advisers said the budget offered a graphic opportunity to bring various threads of the Texas story together. These threads, as Mr. Gore described them today, run from Mr. Bush's ''unaffordable tax cuts for powerful interests, coupled with vague promises that the numbers will somehow add up in the future.''</p>
        <p>One Gore aide exclaimed, ''It's a metaphor for everything!''</p>
        <p>The announcement of Mr. Gore's trip to Texas comes amid growing fights among Texas lawmakers and public officials over the state's budget. Earlier this week Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander announced that the state would see an estimated $1.1 billion surplus -- more than enough, she said, to pay for the estimated $610 million in cost overruns that has pushed the state over budget.</p>
        <p>''There's not a shortfall,'' said Ms. Rylander, who will release a final figure for the surplus on Friday. ''There are budgeting adjustments.''</p>
        <p>She said she made the announcement to reassure Wall Street investors. But Democrats questioned the timing of Ms. Rylander's announcement of the surplus, noting that the comptroller usually projects revenue at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <p>The controversy became public last week when state budget officials confirmed that unanticipated cost overruns, particularly in Medicaid and in state prisons, had thrown the state $610 million over budget. Mr. Bush's aides quickly responded that cost overruns were routine during any two-year budget cycle, and that the surplus would more than make up the difference.</p>
        <p>But several Texas Democrats are pouncing on the issue, blaming the $1.7 billion in tax cuts championed by Mr. Bush for the shortfall, and portraying the governor as having put short-term political interests ahead of the state's fiscal stability.</p>
        <p>An internal memorandum leaked from the Texas Department of Health has only fueled the controversy by predicting that Medicaid shortfalls alone could reach $633 million by Aug. 31, 2001. Ultimately, the Legislature must approve an emergency appropriation next year to keep the state in the black.</p>
        <p>The sudden scrutiny of the Texas budget has also focused attention on the $84 million in the state's Rainy Day Fund, an account established in the 1980's after the oil boom ran out of steam. Dick Lavine of the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin said the Rainy Day Fund, as it stands, could pay for state government services for about 16 hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's spokesman, Dan Bartlett, said that the Rainy Day Fund had only $8 million when Mr. Bush took office in 1995 and that the account has since grown tenfold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been mentioning Mr. Bush's budget problems every day since the issue emerged last Friday, although his main focus has been another set topic.</p>
        <p>At the City Hall here, where he announced a proposal to help local communities hire 10,000 more prosecutors, Mr. Gore began with a minor tutorial on the Texas budget.</p>
        <p>''Several days ago, we learned that under Governor Bush's leadership, Texas has suddenly gone from its biggest budget surplus ever to a budget shortfall, the most serious budget problem in almost a decade,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech at the City Council chamber here.</p>
        <p>''Now, we learn at a time of national prosperity -- indeed, the longest economic boom in the history of America -- that Texas has saved less for the future than almost every other state in America,'' Mr. Gore continued. ''The state's so-called Rainy Day Fund could barely withstand a drizzle. It's now so small that by this fall there will be only enough money to run the Texas state government for a single day. You know, there'd be a real problem if Texas had a rainy season.''</p>
