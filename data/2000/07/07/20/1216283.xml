        <p>The Ford Motor Company said today that brisk sales of luxury cars and sport utility vehicles and growing profit from auto loans and leases lifted its operating earnings in the second-quarter. But a pair of one-time charges announced last week caused the automaker to post its first quarterly loss since the fourth quarter of 1992.</p>
        <p>Excluding the one-time charges, Ford's after-tax earnings from operations rose 8.5 percent, to $2.69 billion. Per-share earnings from continuing operations rose 10 percent, to $2.20, beating by 12 cents the consensus forecast of analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>After relying very heavily on profit from sport utility vehicle sales in the United States over the last several years, Ford managed a somewhat more diverse blend of earnings in the second quarter. Strong sales of the Ford Focus small car, the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable midsize sedans and the Mercury Grand Marquis large sedan meant that cars accounted for a growing percentage of overall profit, said Henry Wallace, the chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Ford Credit, a wholly owned subsidiary that issues auto loans and leases, posted a 16 percent gain in profit, to $388 million, continuing a turnaround that began late last year. And Ford's results improved in Latin America and East Asia, although profit eroded at the company's European operations.</p>
        <p>But the strong operating earnings were more than offset by one-time charges totaling $3.27 billion. Ford took a $1.02 billion charge for writing down the value of many factories and buildings in Europe to reflect their actual value and for covering the cost of early retirement incentives and other programs to reduce payrolls in Europe, where Ford's market share has been falling. Ford also took a charge of $2.25 billion for the spinoff on June 28 of the Visteon Corporation, its auto parts division, because the Visteon parts factories had been carried on Ford's books at a far greater value than the market value of the division when it became an independent company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace said the Visteon charge was purely a bookkeeping change that did not reflect on the company's financial health and had no cash implications. ''The Visteon thing is just a paperwork exercise to get our books in order,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Including the one-time charges, Ford reported a loss of $577 million, compared with a profit of $2.34 billion a year earlier, when Ford's only one-time charge was $146 million related to the acquisition of Volvo Car.</p>
        <p>Ford shares rose 50 cents today to close at $47.4375 even as broad market measures fell.</p>
        <p>The company is wallowing in cash, reporting today that it had $25.56 billion in cash and marketable securities. It plans to distribute $10 billion of that to shareholders next month in a complex recapitalization of the company. Though some institutional investors have suggested the plan is more advantageous to the Ford family, which holds a special class of stock, than to other shareholders, Mr. Wallace rejected such criticism today, saying that the plan was fair and would not be reconsidered.</p>
        <p>The robust results announced today by Ford Credit confirmed the growing perception in Detroit that the lending division has recovered from its difficulties two years ago, when decades of profit growth came to an abrupt halt. Ford Credit, like many other companies in the auto-leasing business, overestimated in the mid-1990's how much money it could make by selling vehicles returned by customers at the end of their leases.</p>
        <p>In response to losses on these leases, it created its own system for predicting the value of such vehicles instead of relying on published figures from industry associations. The lending subsidiary's executives said in interviews that the problems of the mid-1990's had been resolved.</p>
        <p>''We know a lot more than we did then,'' said Elizabeth Acton, the chief financial officer of Ford Credit. ''We have developed much more sophisticated computer modeling.''</p>
        <p>Gary Lapidus, an auto analyst at Goldman Sachs, said the improvement at Ford Credit was particularly impressive in view of the Federal Reserve's repeated increases in short-term interest rates over the last year, which hurt auto lenders. ''It was a good result, especially with rates going up,'' he said.</p>
