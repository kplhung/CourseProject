        <p>Earnings at the nation's two largest airline companies, the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, and the AMR Corporation, owner of American Airlines, handily beat Wall Street expectations yesterday. But the good news was tempered by United's warning of weaker earnings in the current quarter, igniting a large sell-off of airline stocks, led by UAL.</p>
        <p>In addition, US Airways, the No. 6 carrier, said its profit plunged 41 percent, excluding one-time gains, while T.W.A., which has continued to elude profitability despite the travel boom of recent years, narrowed its losses more than analysts had predicted.</p>
        <p>The strong showing by United and American came after similar reports by Continental Airlines and the low-fare leader Southwest Airlines on Tuesday. ''If the economy is slowing down, we don't see it in the airline business,'' said Tom Horton, AMR's chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>Operating profit at UAL rose 17 percent, to $408 million, or $3.47 a diluted share, compared with $349 million, or $2.86 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $5.11 billion from $4.54 billion in 1999. Analysts had expected the company to earn $3.24 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>United said that it had benefited from higher fares and a 6.8 percent increase in passenger traffic in the quarter, led by a 21 percent increase in the Asia-Pacific region. That more than made up for the surge in fuel prices, which is an airline's second-biggest expense after labor, thanks to an aggressive hedging program that locked in fuel costs before the big price increases.</p>
        <p>But United also suffered from several operational headaches in the quarter that gave it the poorest on-time record and most flight cancellations among the big airlines. Executives blamed unusually poor weather, the air-traffic control system and the refusal of many pilots, who are angry about the slow pace of contract negotiations, to fly overtime.</p>
        <p>Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said that the pilot action cost the company $50 million during the quarter. United has cut thousands of flights and is adding more time into its schedule to try to reduce cancellations and delays. Mr. Dutta said that revenue would continue to be strong in the current quarter but that the reduction in capacity along with higher fuel and wage costs would result in earnings between $2.60 and $3.20 a share, lower than analysts were expecting.</p>
        <p>The news caused shares of UAL to plunge $5.9375, or 10 percent, to $53.3125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>AMR reported a 32 percent surge in profit, excluding extraordinary items, to $285 million, or $1.75 a share, compared with $216 million, or $1.36 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 10.4 percent, to $5 billion from $4.5 billion last year. Analysts had expected AMR to earn $1.57, according to First Call.</p>
        <p>American also benefited from hedging its fuel costs, saving $105 million during the quarter, Mr. Horton said. He said that the airline also gained $10 million to $15 million in additional revenue by attracting passengers displaced by cancellations at United, its main competitor.</p>
        <p>In addition, American faced an easier comparison with results in the quarter a year earlier, when its bookings were weakened by the aftermath of a pilot sickout that crippled its operations. And a recent decision to remove seats from most of its airplanes to give passengers more legroom helped increase its average fare.</p>
        <p>Revenue at US Airways rose 6.4 percent during the quarter, to $2.43 billion from $2.28 billion in 1999. But profit fell to $80 million, or $1.17 a share, compared with $136 million, or $1.83 a share, in 1999, excluding one-time gains. Analysts were expecting US Airways to earn $1.36 a share.</p>
        <p>Passenger demand was strong at the airline, which agreed in May to be acquired by UAL for $4.3 billion,  but it was hurt more by the rise in the cost of fuel than were United and American. US Airways said that its fuel costs rose nearly 63 percent during the quarter, or $102 million, whereas American said its fuel costs rose only 37 percent. In addition, US Airways lost some lucrative business passengers who shied away from the airline because of the threat of a strike by its flight attendants.</p>
        <p>Rakesh Gangwal, the chief executive of US Airways, told analysts that the airline was focusing on winning back business travelers. But he predicted a further decline in unit revenue in the third quarter and another hit from higher fuel costs.</p>
        <p>T.W.A. also had record traffic during the quarter. Revenue rose 10.3 percent, to $954.9 million from $866 million. But the struggling airline, which does not aggressively hedge its fuel costs, was still in the red. T.W.A. said that it lost $4.2 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a loss of $5.3 million, or 17 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Still, analysts had expected the airline to lose 33 cents a share during the quarter.</p>
        <p>T.W.A.'s last profitable quarter was two years ago.</p>
