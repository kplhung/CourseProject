        <p>GLEN SENK and Keith Johnson call themselves ''dedicated urbanites.'' They are quick to reel off the years they have lived in Manhattan (13), in London (3), in San Francisco (3 more), and downtown here in a 1752 town house (5).</p>
        <p>''We see ourselves as city people; we never dreamed of moving to Chestnut Hill,'' said Mr. Senk, the president of Anthropologie, the chain of hip stores selling things like velvet pants trimmed with lace, mink tote bags and garden urns from Provence.</p>
        <p>But one day, about four years ago, they found themselves on a dead end in Philadelphia's turn-of-the-century garden district, Chestnut Hill, staring at an old stone mansion full of windows.</p>
        <p>''Now there's a house we'd move for,'' the men recalled saying. Built from local Wissahickon Schist, the two-story house stretched a good 60 feet across, its windows nearly buried in boxwood and rhododendrons. Tall trees towered over a yard that sloped down to the Wissahickon Creek, which flows for miles through the city's 4,400-acre Fairmount Park.</p>
        <p>Be careful what you wish for. A year later, on a cold December day, they stood in front of the house with a real estate agent. ''Before even going in, we knew this was it,'' Mr. Senk said. ''I think houses have energy. Every time we've bought a house, the decision has been literally made in seconds. Then you spend the next half-hour walking through the rooms, convincing yourself it's the right decision.'' They bought it that day, for $790,000.</p>
        <p>Two Scottish sisters, the cook and housekeeper for the owner, Frances Wolf, a widow who had died in her 90's, met them at the door.</p>
        <p>''Nothing had been touched,'' said Mr. Johnson, who scours the world for antiques and garden ornaments. ''There were photographs everywhere, like one of Mrs. Wolf as a child, or maybe her husband, standing in front of the Pyramids, and the same shot decades later of the whole family.''</p>
        <p>The closets were still full of old dresses and suits. The windows were heavily draped. The vast kitchen was built for butlers and maids, with pantries and glass cupboards and buzzers to all the rooms. The white walls were yellowed with smoke from the cigarettes smoked by the sisters, who spent most of their days drinking tea (and smoking, of course) by the stove.</p>
        <p>But a wall of windows let in northern light that a painter would die for. And every other room has a similar feeling -- of great space opening out into the country. There are 11 fireplaces, including one on the old brick terrace that faces the south gardens, a nice touch for chilly spring and fall evenings.</p>
        <p>Then there were the grounds, which were just as cluttered as the house. Soon the two new occupants were calling on the landscape architect Margie Ruddick, who had recently moved her small firm from New York to Philadelphia and is known for her naturalistic designs.</p>
        <p>''It was an editing job,'' Ms. Ruddick said as she stood in the front yard, where a giant Katsura tree and a towering redwood now command attention over an understory of newly planted woodland shrubs like deutzia, oakleaf hydrangea, mountain laurel and witch hazel. ''The trees are magnificent, but this was a big stew.''</p>
        <p>They made difficult decisions, like ripping out enormous boxwoods, and a beautiful old cyrptomeria that was simply too close to the front door. ''It was like having a big log in front of your nose,'' Ms. Ruddick said.</p>
        <p>They replaced the curving blacktop driveway with a wide, soft gravel forecourt that ends in a mossy footpath disappearing into arching witch hazels. And they planted dawn redwoods to make a grove around the old one at the top of the drive.</p>
        <p>But as the old boxwoods came out, so did the old neighbors.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was coming by, demanding, 'What are you doing!' '' Mr. Johnson said. ''They'd all been to parties here and loved the garden the way it was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Senk, who grew up in a modernist landscape designed by James Rose in Brookville, N.Y., was relieved by the empty spaces.</p>
        <p>''I found the boxwood and ivy kind of suffocating,'' Mr. Senk said by phone from California, where he was opening a new store. ''And I really don't like circular driveways, so we got rid of that immediately.'' Two specimen boxwoods were moved from the back of the house, to either side of the front door, in a tip of the cap to the past.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, on the other hand, was reluctant to let anything green go. ''And I love stuff,'' he said. ''I like clutter. But I really appreciate being edited.''</p>
        <p>Thus Ms. Ruddick's team and the project's gardener, Mary Costello, had the dream clients. The two men didn't know much about plants, but they showed the team images of what they liked.</p>
        <p>''They were big bold plants with dramatic foliage like yuccas, artichokes and thistles,'' Ms. Ruddick said. ''And many of them are drought-tolerant.'' The designers also took their cues from the colorful fabrics and simple, good furniture the men liked.</p>
        <p>The back of the house has a wide brick terrace shaded by wisteria (now tamed) and a series of terraced gardens, buttressed with stone walls, to keep them from literally sliding down the hill to the Wissahickon. ''To me, it feels a bit like Tuscany,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The house is staid and proper. The garden is full and overflowing.''</p>
        <p>But over the years, the sloping hill had been sliced up with zigzagging paths made of railroad ties, and lined with black railings to help the elderly widow walk down to the 1960's pool -- an aquamarine concrete rectangle, complete with diving board -- which seems to float on a raised plateau in the woods. The stone walls were built by Italian masons, who included a grotto for a Madonna-like figure that appears to be cemented in for eternity.</p>
        <p>Of course, a more naturalistic pool, and less aggressive terraces might suit the new owners better. But they are part of the karma of the place. So is the Madonna, whose blue shawl and eyes match the pool.</p>
        <p>''She's kind of a vestige of the Wolfs,'' Mr. Senk said. ''It's so clear how they loved the property. We feel they're still living with us.'' Indeed, their ashes are buried in the garden, so who knows what spirits might be floating about?</p>
        <p>Even so, some of this jungle had to be cut back. The tulip poplars in the woods around the pool have been limbed up, the ivy and vines pulled down. Stones from the pool's terrace have been removed here and there, and planted with creeping thyme and lemon mint. There are pots of verbena, rosemary and fragrant geraniums.</p>
        <p>The boxwoods and ivy were yanked off the stone terraces, the tight plantings removed, to make room for sun-loving plants like Arundo donax, which looks like corn, and towers over a huge planting of tall purple bee balm; six-foot, bright yellow Rudbeckia maxima; bronze fennel; and purple smoke bush. The pots and urns that Mr. Johnson brings home from his travels are filled with things like Nicotiana sylvestris, which stands four feet tall over rambling chartreuse and purplish-black potato vines.</p>
        <p>Most important, the zigzagging paths that chopped up the slope have been removed, and the land regraded to form gentle hills that flow naturally toward the woods. After their first night in the house, Mr. Johnson took a sledgehammer to the stockade fence that blocked off part of the back terrace, where the maids hung laundry. Now that spot, overlooking the gardens, is a favorite place to barbecue and sip a drink at sunset.</p>
        <p>He also uncovered an old curving shallow pool on the eastern slope of the property. ''I was digging out masses of ivy and rhododendrons,'' he said. ''And I hit stone. Then I realized there was a rhythm to it.''</p>
        <p>These days, the dedicated urbanites find it harder and harder to leave this suburb --  oops, garden oasis, which is somehow part of the city. ''I want to stay around and see what pops up,'' Mr. Johnson said. He takes his corgis, Cosmo and Orbit, for daily walks down to the Wissahickon. ''We only have an acre, but we don't need more. We have the park, which has thousands of acres that I don't have to take care of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Senk said: ''You get to the point where you don't want to live in the city anymore. But you still want to live like an urban person.'' Which is why Chestnut Hill was created almost a century ago.</p>
