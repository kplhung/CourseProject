        <p>Re ''Cell Phones and Safety'' (editorial, July 19):</p>
        <p>I was crossing Broadway, with the light, at 95th Street recently. I saw a car begin to turn, without signaling, as I was halfway across the uptown side of the street. Assuming that the driver was driving with his eyes open, I kept walking. And the car kept turning -- and turning -- faster.</p>

        <p>Re ''Cell Phones and Safety'' (editorial, July 19):</p>
        <p>I was crossing Broadway, with the light, at 95th Street recently. I saw a car begin to turn, without signaling, as I was halfway across the uptown side of the street. Assuming that the driver was driving with his eyes open, I kept walking. And the car kept turning -- and turning -- faster.</p>
        <p>As there was no place for me to go at that point and the driver's window was open, I yelled for him to stop. He didn't see me. He didn't even hear me. He was too busy talking on his cell phone. He missed me by about three inches. He just kept going.</p>
        <p>I urge a ban on cell phone use while operating a vehicle. If you have to use a cell phone, pull over to the side of the road and stop.</p>
        <p>Hands-free phones are not the point. The point is concentration.</p>
