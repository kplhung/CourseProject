        <p>Children's swimming lessons always used to have a buddy system, a pairing of two novices, so each would always know where the other was in the water and come to the rescue in case of trouble. But in ''Never Swim Alone,'' a peculiar theater piece by a Canadian playwright, Daniel Mac Ivor, at the SoHo Playhouse, the two designated buddies try to drown each other as they dog paddle through the troubled waters of life.</p>
        <p>At the outset the two buddies -- Frank Delorenzo (John Maria) and Bill Wade (Douglas Dickerman) -- enter from the back of the theater and make their way to the stage slowly, stopping to shake hands with members of the audience and thank them for showing up. Dressed in dark suits and white shirts (only the ties are different) and carrying briefcases, they could be corporate executives arriving to address a stockholders' meeting.</p>

        <p>Children's swimming lessons always used to have a buddy system, a pairing of two novices, so each would always know where the other was in the water and come to the rescue in case of trouble. But in ''Never Swim Alone,'' a peculiar theater piece by a Canadian playwright, Daniel Mac Ivor, at the SoHo Playhouse, the two designated buddies try to drown each other as they dog paddle through the troubled waters of life.</p>
        <p>At the outset the two buddies -- Frank Delorenzo (John Maria) and Bill Wade (Douglas Dickerman) -- enter from the back of the theater and make their way to the stage slowly, stopping to shake hands with members of the audience and thank them for showing up. Dressed in dark suits and white shirts (only the ties are different) and carrying briefcases, they could be corporate executives arriving to address a stockholders' meeting.</p>
        <p>The stage is bare except for an empty lifeguard stand and, directly downstage from it, what is clearly a human body covered by a beach towel. After repeating their welcome to the audience (speaking in unison like a Greek chorus, a trick they repeat several times during the hourlong show), they ceremoniously lift the blanket to reveal a girl in a blue bathing suit.</p>
        <p>The girl (Susan O'Connor) suddenly springs to her feet and tells a story in the third person about two boys and a girl on a secluded beach one summer, and hints ominously at some terrible consequence of the girl's challenge to the boys to a swimming race across a bay. If the details seem a little vague, don't worry; she will repeat this several times as well. There is quite a bit of repetition in ''Never Swim Alone.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacIvor then abruptly changes metaphors in midstream as the girl announces a 13-round bout between the two supposed bosom buddies; she will referee it from the lifeguard stand.</p>
        <p>Frank and Bill then square off in round after round of verbal punching and jabbing (each round announced by the referee as the name of a game like ''power lunch'' or ''walking like a duck'').</p>
        <p>Like fighters sparring in the opening rounds, Frank and Bill begin with light but pointed teasing and banter, then escalate to personal insults and slurs on each other's parents and spouses, and finally degenerate into fisticuffs and death threats. The girl announces a winner after each round, and every so often she returns to the story of the swimming race that day on the beach.</p>
        <p>Some of the rounds are amusing as commentaries on modern-day corporate one-upmanship, like the one of the power lunch or others in which the contenders vie over who is chummier with the boss or who is more touchy-feely sensitive. (In one they argue over who loves horses the most.) Other scenes are funny in a clownish way, like the duck-walking contest or another in which they compete over who falls dead the best.</p>
        <p>But as clever as some of this may be, the scenes seem like a series of skits that have been strung together to no particular purpose except to explore the possibility that one's best buddy from childhood may turn out to be one's worst enemy. As for the dark secret of that summer day at the beach, most people in the audience can guess what it is even as they take their seats and see the body onstage. What it has to do with the 13 rounds of vitriol that form the heart of ''Never Swim Alone'' is never really explained.</p>
        <p>The three-member cast deftly mines the humor in the skits, and each gives a winning performance. Mr. Maria and Mr. Dickerman are especially poised as a couple of killer sharks dressed in suits and disguised with confident smiles. Timothy P. Jones's fast-paced direction makes the rapid transitions of so many brief scenes in such a short time seem effortless.</p>

Jones; lighting by John Pinckard; stage manager, Monique Nottke; fight director, Ian Marshall; assistant stage manager, Simone Ferdinand; general manager, Darren Lee Cole.
