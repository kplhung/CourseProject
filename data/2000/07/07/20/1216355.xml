        <p>For the last several days, Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign staff and her surrogates have worked behind the scenes and in public to snuff out the controversy over an allegation that she made an anti-Semitic remark long ago, a charge she has denied.</p>
        <p>And according to a campaign aide's memo leaked to the news media by a recipient of it yesterday, the efforts to rebut the allegation included enlisting Jewish supporters to call reporters at Jewish publications this week to defend Mrs. Clinton. A new book accuses her of unleashing a slur  26 years ago at the manager of Bill Clinton's losing congressional race in Arkansas. Mrs. Clinton has vehemently denied making the remark, though the target, Paul Fray, stood by the allegation in an interview broadcast yesterday on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC.</p>
        <p>''I'd be glad to take a lie-detector exam,'' said Mr. Fray, who is a Baptist but says his paternal great-grandmother was Jewish. ''That's the bottom line right there in a nutshell. And if that doesn't satisfy the question, then let me take a truth serum.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's supporters have gone to great lengths this week to challenge Mr. Fray's credibility, and the Clinton campaign memo lists several talking points that do the same.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fray and his wife have acknowledged in a series of television and newspaper interviews that he lost his license to practice law years ago for altering court records and had suffered a brain hemorrhage that led to some memory loss, but insist that he remembers the remark clearly. He acknowledged in yesterday's television interview that he had leveled false accusations at the Clintons in the past.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, at a news conference in Albany, where she received the endorsement of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: ''I've said all I'm going to say about this. It wasn't true, it didn't happen and I'm not going to allow it to distract from the real issues of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>But just as Mrs. Clinton sought to move past the episode, her staff had to answer questions about the memo to Jewish supporters that disclosed how orchestrated their efforts were.  In the memo, an adviser on Jewish affairs urges supporters to call reporters at two Jewish publications to defend Mrs. Clinton, and implores them not to reveal that the campaign had requested them to do so.</p>
        <p>''I would appreciate it if you could call these people as concerned citizens, (It is important that you do not say that you calling because the campaign asked you to, but because you are outraged with what was said about her.),'' the memo, from Karen Adler, said. ''The most important thing is to let them know that you know Hillary and you know that she would never make these kinds of Anti-Semitic or racist comments.''</p>
        <p>One of the reporters, Rachel Donadio, of The Forward, said she received two calls Monday evening from people she does not normally talk to offering their unsolicited, positive views of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The other reporter, Adam Dickter of The Jewish Week, said he received seven calls -- some from usual sources, some not -- but he did not know if they were prompted by the memo.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said the memo was written to assist people who had called the campaign office angry over the charge and wanting to offer their support.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to know how they could be most helpful,'' said Mr. Wolfson, who initially declined to say why callers were asked not to reveal the Clinton campaign's involvement in their calls. But he later called back to say ''it was a mistake. It was not prudent to do.''</p>
        <p>The campaign staff of Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, which had already questioned Mrs. Clinton's denial of the remark, seized on the memo.</p>
        <p>''I think it is very sad that Mrs. Clinton would ask her supporters to lie for her,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, referring to the claim that recipients of the  memo had been asked not to say that they were asked to call reporters. ''The credibility of Mrs. Clinton and her camp suffered irreparable damage today, and increasingly New Yorkers have to wonder if they can trust her.''</p>
        <p>Some Jewish supporters, however, continued to rally behind Mrs. Clinton, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, who called a news conference in Washington yesterday with other Jewish lawmakers to express their support for Mrs. Clinton.</p>
