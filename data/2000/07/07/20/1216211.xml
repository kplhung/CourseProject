        <p>AMERICAN RHAPSODY  By Joe Eszterhas  432 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.95.</p>
        <p>At last we have concrete evidence that during the events leading up to President Clinton's impeachment trial, the level of national discourse really did reach the level of a Joe Eszterhas movie. Because in his new book, Mr. Eszterhas, author of the award-winning ''Showgirls'' (jacket copy cites its Sour Apple Award from the Hollywood Women's Press Association) has brought his screenwriting skills to bear upon imagining the deepest, darkest, sudsiest thoughts of this scandalous story's major and bit players. Harry Potter is the rare contemporary celebrity whose sex life does not come under lascivious scrutiny here.</p>
        <p>There are ways in which even the author's ''Basic Instinct'' pales by comparison to his ''American Rhapsody.'' After all, by Page 5 Mr. Eszterhas has the president smoking marijuana while wearing a girlfriend's dress, and this is quite a long-winded, excitedly profane book. And his most attention-getting move here is writing not just a speaking part, but also rap lyrics to be delivered to the president by the president's chatty penis, in verse that bespeaks either the author's professional death wish or his pathological nostalgia for junior high school. Sample rhyme: ''You want fame, I want a dame.'' Sample couplet: ''For better or worse, it's me and you/So stop feeling so low-down blue.''</p>
        <p>As this may suggest, sex is central to ''American Rhapsody.'' But it's sex as in ''sexagenarian,'' since the author is largely concerned with the presidential generation now crowding 60, and since reflections on his own heavily fraught sexual identity provide the book's galvanizing force.</p>
        <p>Something about this presidential scandal has rekindled the countercultural energy in Mr. Eszterhas, who was a gutsy, pioneering Rolling Stone reporter long before he hit Hollywood (and vice versa). He is reminded, sometimes ad nauseam, that behaving like a rock star around groupies was once (to his thinking) the mandate of the free-spirited male sex drugs and rock 'n' roller, and that a funny thing happened to those standards on the way to the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>So this loose, rambling sketchbook, which is both personal and political memoir, becomes the author's effort to understand what became of the sexual mores of his floridly evoked youth. ''We wore no underwear, and the funkier our bell-bottoms looked, the hipper they were, especially if there was a copy of Chairman Mao's Little Red Book in the back pocket,'' he writes, with a typical taste for generational slander. ''We swore by our genitals the way Nixon swore by his 'old Quaker mother.' ''</p>
        <p>Thus predisposed, and ready to embrace Bill Clinton as the poster president for 60's culture and idealism, not to mention as a kindred spirit whose ''mad priapic obsession'' he shared, Mr. Eszterhas found himself obsessed and enraged by recent White House scandals. In writing this book, he explains, he ''was thinking about the state of the union and the state of our hearts and privates as we tried not to stumble and slide on the treacherous Internet ice of the new millennium.''</p>
        <p>What that means, in more nuts-and-bolts terms, is a book that is interspersed with clearly fictitious, largely awkward monologues (ascribed to Bob Dole, Al Gore, Monica Lewinsky, etc.) but consists mostly of the author's rehashing and embellishing recent, familiar events.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eszterhas demonstrates, for instance, a sharp ear for dialogue in choosing telltale taped conversational snippets from Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, but anyone who followed these revelations as they unfolded is liable to have heard this material before. And not even his prodigious research into the writings of Gennifer Flowers has much news value by now.</p>
        <p>Though he has researched this material so thoroughly as to come up with trivia from Matt Drudge's high school yearbook, the story he tells is not easily improved upon. It was a bad enough movie before Mr. Eszterhas decided to use a nickname for the presidential penis (''Willard'') and write White House love scenes with feeling.</p>
        <p>Thus one-upped by the awful truth, Mr. Eszterhas winds up looking elsewhere for frissons of scandal. So his otherwise surprisingly tame account is punctuated by all manner of free-floating slurs, from Jay Leno's meanest Hillary Clinton jokes to casual asides. (''Her style was to eat fried chicken in the back seat of the limo with Bill when he was governor and to leave the chewed bones on the limo floor.'') And, as he says repeatedly, Mr. Eszterhas likes Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>He saves the real venom, and the cheapest shots, for those practitioners of Hollywood ethics whose behavior, as the book argues, is the model for the sexually exploitative power politics that real politics have come to mimic. He seems both shocked and amused to suggest that the distance between Bill Clinton and the producer Bob Evans (described here as the compleat party animal, in the book's least interesting revelation) is smaller than it seems.</p>
        <p>Beach-book fanciers will undoubtedly gravitate to the freely flung dirt here, from invidious suggestions that Sharon Stone is the kind of actress who sexually curries favor with the screenwriter, even if the screenwriter is Mr. Eszterhas, to a particularly cruel anecdote about Farrah Fawcett, to Larry Flynt's description of having sex with a chicken. (Mr. Flynt, unlike many of the more straight-arrow types described here, comes across as a well-evoked kindred spirit.) But this kind of reference is what demolishes the book's real passion.</p>
        <p>The author's fierce longing for a lost 60's idealism comes through even when he is not dropping the name of his friend Jimi Hendrix or noting that he was the only white listener to a speech given by Stokely Carmichael. But he can't easily rekindle that generational fire while dragging this memoir through the mud.</p>
        <p>''American Rhapsody'' is mercifully free of cynicism, though. It's easy to believe Mr. Eszterhas's assertion that he was genuinely roiled by national events to the point where this was a book he had to write. It's also easy to hear traces of the (by now) grand old Rolling Stone tradition of fearless, indignant first-person political reporting in the youthful outrage that he struggles to reinvent. Freed of all the excess (and excessive) baggage he piles onto ''American Rhapsody,'' perhaps that old voice could have been loud and clear.</p>
