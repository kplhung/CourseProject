        <p>What the world's top 10 players will have to overcome to win the British Open. By Clifton Brown</p>
        <p>1. Tiger Woods -- Has never won two majors in the same year. And it's hard being the favorite.  2. David Duval -- No victories since April of last year, and has never won a major.  3. Ernie Els -- May have peaked too soon. Until last week, he had not won since 1998.  4. Colin Montgomerie -- The longer he goes without a major, the harder it gets.  5. Lee Westwood -- Higher expectations now that people think he can win a major.  6. Davis Love III -- No victories since 1998, and his confidence is questionable.  7. Phil Mickelson -- In seven British Opens, his best finish is a tie for 24th.  8. Hal Sutton -- Has played in one British Open since 1988, and last saw St. Andrews in '84.  9. Vijay Singh -- One top 10 finish in 11 British Opens. Missed the cut last year.  10. Jesper Parnevik -- Could be hampered by a sore hip and past British failures.</p>
        <p>Prediction  Woods will win.  After what he did at the United States Open, it's hard to pick against him.</p>
