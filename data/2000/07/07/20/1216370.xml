        <p>They've been called the Cadets as far back as anyone can remember, but from now on Army's sports teams will be known as the Black Knights. Officially, that is.</p>
        <p>The Army logo of a kicking mule with the letter A is being replaced by one with a sword-wielding black knight astride a horse, with ''Army'' and ''Black Knights'' underneath in block letters. The logo was unveiled last night at the Hotel Thayer at the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Bob Beretta, spokesman for Army's athletic department, said his research showed that the Army football team had been called the Black Knights of the Hudson by some sportswriters as far back as the 1920's or 1930's.</p>
        <p>''Some coaches have even been using a black knight in their team's logo because they didn't like the one with the mule and the Army A, which has been around for about 25 years,'' Beretta said.</p>
        <p>Lest anyone fear that the legendary Army mules are about to be put out to pasture, Beretta said, ''The mule will remain as the Army mascot. That's a West Point tradition that's not going to change.''</p>
