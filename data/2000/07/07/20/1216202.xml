        <p>MARVIN GEORGE doesn't play for keeps.</p>
        <p>Mr. George, a soft-spoken postal worker from Bridgeport, W.Va., reasons that the youth of West Virginia would be well served if they played more marbles and if their parents and teachers held more marbles tournaments. A dozen years ago, when his daughter won a local tournament, he began to talk teachers and principals into sponsoring local events. As executive director of the West Virginia Marble Shooters Association, he now runs two statewide tournaments, one for children 14 and under and one for all ages.</p>
        <p>''We don't play for keeps in our tournament,'' Mr. George said. ''We provide the marbles to our kids, and we play for points.'' The winners get scholarships of up to $1,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. George's marbles site, www.marbles.net, gives the rules for  Ringer, the most popular tournament marbles game, and leads to his two tournaments and a third one in Maryland. The Mountaineer Marbles Tournament for children was held last week in Beckley, W.Va. Mr. George has sponsored eventual champions in the National Marbles Tournament (www.blocksite.com /wildwood), a 77-year-old event held in Wildwood, N.J., each Father's Day.</p>
        <p>West Virginia was the center of American marble making during this country's golden age of marbles, roughly 1920 to 1960. Those days are gone. Next door to Mr. George's town, in Clarksburg, the police routinely shoo away or arrest entrepreneurs and collectors who try to sneak onto a torn-up former factory floor of the Akro Agate Company, looking in old drainpipes and digging around the grounds for corkscrews and Popeyes and sparklers and fluorescents (from uranium salts) and other rare marble varieties. Akro Agate closed in 1951, and the building was razed three years ago.</p>
        <p>Asia and Mexico have taken over machine-made marbles, and today there are only a handful of American marble companies.</p>
        <p>Fewer children play marbles today, even in West Virginia, than during the golden age, Mr. George acknowledged. ''The experts say it's because of television and Little League and different organized sports,'' he said. ''It's my belief it's because adults don't want to organize tournaments anymore.''</p>
        <p>But marbles have had a curious resurgence, caused in part by the Internet. Colorful Web sites have spurred interest in marble collecting, and the Internet is full of advertisements. The collecting interest, in turn, has led to specialty marble making and to a increase in the number of organized marble tournaments.</p>
        <p>The two worlds of marbles, playing and collecting, are both represented at MarbleCollecting.com (www.blocksite.com), whose operator, Robert Block, writes about marbles and holds online marble auctions. Its reference section includes lists and links to rules for different games, major tournaments, a Frequently Asked Questions page with the history of marbles, a bibliography and an archive of articles from the Marble Mania newsletter. There are sections on marble auctions, shows, and clubs and membership information for the Marble Collectors Society of America.</p>
        <p>On the site, you learn that marbles have been found in Egyptian tombs and North American Indian mounds, and that William Blake painted three boys playing marbles for his poem ''The Schoolboy.'' You can also learn how to make a marble by hand, which, the site says, is now being done by 50 American artisans.</p>
        <p>The sites reveal marbles' fascinating contributions to the American language. Steelies. Cat's eyes. Aggies. No histing. No hunching, either. Playing for keeps and playing for fair. Slipses. And remember to knuckle down. Besides Akro Agate's varieties, there are the classics made by Marble King of Peyden City, W. Va.: bumblebees and wasps and rainbows and Spider-Men. Not to mention Swirls, Peerless Patches, Christmas Trees and Golden Rebels by Peltier Glass Company of Ottawa, Ill.</p>
        <p>Mr. George isn't particularly interested in promoting marble dealers or marble shows at his tournaments, although he is grateful to them for promoting interest in the game. ''The two worlds don't really mix,'' he said. Kids, especially the elementary school kids, they need to know about winning and losing and what it's like to lose, and what it's like to practice.''</p>
