        <p>In a dramatic turnaround, President Clinton announced early this morning that the Middle East peace talks that were described by his spokesman as having failed to reach an agreement, would remain intact, and that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders would stay at Camp David to continue meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K.

        <p>Mr. Clinton said that after the announcement late Wednesday that no agreement had been reached, there had been a substantial change of mind.

        <p>In a dramatic turnaround, President Clinton announced early this morning that the Middle East peace talks that were described by his spokesman as having failed to reach an agreement, would remain intact, and that the Israeli and Palestinian leaders would stay at Camp David to continue meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said that after the announcement late Wednesday that no agreement had been reached, there had been a substantial change of mind. ''We all thought it was over,'' Mr. Clinton said at an elementary school here, five miles away from Camp David. ''Then we discovered nobody wanted to give up. And that should be encouraging.''</p>
        <p>The president had met repeatedly with the Israeli prime minister,  Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, who were at Camp David for nine days. Mr. Clinton then left for Japan, where he is to attend a meeting of the leaders of the seven major industrial nations.</p>
        <p>The swing from announced failure to a renewal of talks came in just over two hours. The presidential spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said that the motorcade taking Mr. Clinton to the White House and then the airport was set to leave Camp David when word spread around the delegations who had never stopped negotiating that it really was over.</p>
        <p>''As we were getting ready to leave, it became clear there was a willingness to stay and an unwillingness to let it break down,'' Mr. Lockhart said. Mr. Barak, who was preparing to give a midnight news conference before leaving for Israel, cancelled his departure plans. Similarly, Mr. Arafat, who was ready to go too, decided to stay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat will meet with Dr. Albright over the next four days to try and close the gaps on the main issues, Mr. Clinton said. On his return from Japan, Mr. Clinton said he would assess the progress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who spoke in a hoarse voice, said the two sides had made an ''intensive effort'' and though the gaps remained ''substantial,'' there ''has been progress.'' He declined to say what the major stumbling blocks were, maintaining that the news blackout that has been in force would remain in his absence.</p>
        <p>The last hours before Mr. Lockhart's announcement just before 11 p.m. that the summit meeting had ended without agreement involved an intensive round of consultations by Mr. Clinton with the two leaders and a series of discussions with their delegations. Just before the public announcement of no agreement was made, Mr. Lockhart said that word was passed to the two parties.</p>
        <p>''The president made the judgment that it was time to leave,'' Mr. Lockhart said. Then in the following 90 minutes the reversal emerged, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton called the summit meeting in a sweeping effort to close the 52-year conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians and put on the table the major issues that the parties had been unable to resolve.</p>
        <p>The question of the sovereignty of Jerusalem was reported to be the main obstacle. And earlier in the evening, according to Radio Israel, Mr. Clinton unsuccessfully proposed that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat accept a partial agreement that did not include Jerusalem. This accord would have dealt with the territorial shape of a Palestinian state and brought a solution to the fate of three million Palestinian refugees scattered through the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and his aides appeared relieved that they had been able to pull the summit meeting from the brink and push it into a new, second phase. But Mr. Lockhart warned: ''I don't know if a few more days will help the process.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday was a day of high tension and rapidly shifting moods. Late into the evening Mr. Clinton was still making an effort to salvage the talks, shuttling between the two sides.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, President Clinton shuttled between Prime Minister Barak and Mr. Arafat -- who did not meet directly with each other -- fending off an Israeli initiative to leave early and turning repeatedly to his advisers and to the negotiators in search of some formula that would save the talks.</p>
        <p>During the nine days of talks, Mr.  Barak and Mr. Arafat apparently dealt with every issue in the conflict -- from borders and the fate of Jewish settlements to the right of return of Palestinian refugees to the status of Jerusalem. But it was unclear  whether the ultimate stumbling block was a single issue, like Jerusalem, or the trade-offs needed to fashion an overall agreement.</p>
        <p>Each side seemed to be gearing up to lay the blame for a failed summit meeting on the other, and each leader appealed privately to President Clinton in letters written in the last 48 hours.</p>
        <p>The mood of the high-tension, high-stakes day seesawed. At midday, it seemed certain that the talks were fizzling out.</p>
        <p>The day built to an unexpectedly quick first climax, when the Israeli journalists accompanying Mr. Barak were ordered in the afternoon to rush to their hotels for a security check so that their luggage could be shuttled to Andrews Air Force Base for an 8 p.m. departure for Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>As the clock ran down, expectations were rife that there had been a breakdown. Israeli television reported, and an American official later confirmed, that Mr. Barak had sent a letter to Mr. Clinton announcing the  Israeli prime minister's departure and laying the blame for the meeting's failure on the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>''The Palestinian side is conducting negotiations insincerely and is not willing to negotiate in a serious and practical manner for a permanent peace between us,'' an Israeli reporter cited as a direct quotation from the letter.</p>
        <p>But a senior Palestinian negotiator, Abu Mazen, who himself was heading to the airport to fly home to his son's wedding, brushed off what he saw as an 11th-hour Israeli tactic to increase pressure on the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said that Mr. Clinton had also received a letter from Mr. Arafat, which arrived on Tuesday, before Mr. Barak's. He did not characterize its contents, but Palestinian officials said that Mr. Arafat had reached a summit of frustration on the eighth day.</p>
        <p>If news of the letters lowered expectations of a deal, Mr. Lockhart reported that Mr. Clinton had managed by late afternoon to keep the leaders from walking out. ''They are still there, they are all still talking,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart made clear that the two leaders were having trouble making concessions on deeply emotional issues.</p>
        <p>''The leaders both want to go home with an agreement,'' Mr. Lockhart said. ''The problem is the substance and structure of the agreement.'' But he added that the extended deadline would have to stand. ''There comes a time when you have to put a time limit on discussions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>During the day, Mr. Clinton telephoned other leaders in the Middle East to brief them on the developments. They were the first such contacts since the meeting opened.</p>
        <p>Inside Camp David, cabin fever combined with exhaustion and the anxiety intensified as the day lengthened into night. Discussions went on, Mr. Lockhart said, at the ''leader level, the negotiator level, between teams and within teams.''</p>
        <p>It appeared that an ultimate sticking point concerned the future status of Jerusalem, the most divisive issue and one that has never before been negotiated by Israeli and Arab leaders. It was seen as the make-or-break issue, but it is possible that other stumbling blocks remained.</p>
        <p>The issue of Jerusalem, long regarded as the most emotive and difficult of the questions separating the Israelis and Palestinians, was brought up in detail for the first time in negotiations.</p>
        <p>After conquering East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel declared that the city would ''eternally'' remain united and under exclusive Israeli sovereignty.</p>
        <p>The visit of the Egyptian leader, Anwar el-Sadat, to Jerusalem in the fall of 1977 was interpreted by the Israelis as recognition of Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital. But a year later, at the first Camp David summit meeting between Mr. Sadat and the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, the question of Jerusalem threatened to scuttle the entire conference.</p>
        <p>President Carter tried to find some sort of symbolic solution -- such as flying Muslim flags on the Temple Mount -- but the suggestions were rejected by the Israelis.</p>
        <p>In the Oslo agreement of 1993, under which Israel recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinians renounced all violence against Israel, the future of Jerusalem, along with the fate of Palestinian refugees, final borders and some other issues, was left for ''final status'' talks. The official position of the United States has been that the fate of Jerusalem must be negotiated between the parties.</p>
        <p>Over the last seven years, diplomats, professors, demographers and officials from both sides have tried to come up with various arrangements that could satisfy the demands of both sides, including ideas that involved autonomy for Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem and would allow the Palestinians to claim the neighboring village of Abu Dis as their Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>But these ideas were dismissed by the Palestinians as a ''Jewish solution.'' Abu Dis, they argued, is not Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Those who have watched Mr. Arafat over many years say that he always set a benchmark: he would not be the Palestinian who went down in history as the one who gave up Arab claims to East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, they point out, was not asking for a divided city but rather shared sovereignty in an open and undivided city. Offering municipal control over some neighborhoods, they said, fell far short.</p>
        <p>Conversely, for Mr. Barak, making concessions on a city that many Jews regard as their capital by divine fiat was extremely difficult.</p>
