        <p>NO amount of scolding, begging or foot-stomping will keep most dogs home in their yards and out of the streets. So some frazzled owners try to turn their neighborhood travelers into docile homebodies with radio-controlled fences.</p>
        <p>These hidden fences consist of wire loops, buried an inch or two below the surface, that emit radio signals when connected to transmitters. Each dog wears a collar with a receiver; when the dog gets too close to the wire, the collar emits a warning beep. If the dog ignores the beep, the collar's two metal prongs give the dog a mild shock, or a series of shocks if the dog persists.</p>
        <p>Debby and Ed Christian have two Old English sheepdogs, who are so well trained by a hidden fence that they never leave the Christians' yard in Acton, Mass. ''I could probably not even use the collars anymore,'' Ms. Christian said, ''and the dogs would stay. Even when another dog comes into the yard, my dogs won't leave.''</p>
        <p>The Christians bought a version called Invisible Fence, made by ISCO Enterprises. Their 8-year-old male, Fletcher, and 2-year-old female, Phoebe, figured out the invisible barrier right away.</p>
        <p>When dogs are trained, flags are posted along the boundary wire and the dogs are walked toward them on a leash. As the dogs approach the flags, the dogs hear their collars beep. They are told ''no'' and are turned back toward the house. The final step in the process, which is repeated over several days, is to deliver a mild shock -- or correction, the euphemism favored by all the hidden-fence manufacturers -- to reinforce the idea that the dog should not cross the boundary line. Some dogs require only one shock to learn to stay within the hidden fence, while others need several.</p>
        <p>The shock hurts the dog, but it causes no lasting harm. The dogs yelp, said Dr. Melissa Bain, a resident in clinical animal behavior at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California at Davis, but the punishment has to be unpleasant to be effective.</p>
        <p>''I was petrified of what was going to happen when the shock was given,'' Ms. Christian said. ''Fletcher jumped in the air and never went near the boundary again.''</p>
        <p>''The shock works,'' said Dr. Katherine Houpt, the director of the Animal Behavioral Clinic for the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University, ''because it is simple aversion learning. However, it works best with those dogs that are not highly motivated to leave.'' Among the more difficult pupils she described are male dogs that are not neutered, dogs that like to hunt or chase cars and highly territorial dogs that are eager to cross boundaries to scare strangers.</p>
        <p>The Invisible Fence was invented in 1973 by Richard Peck, a traveling salesman and animal lover who was saddened by the number of dead dogs he saw on the side of the road. When his patents expired in 1990, several other companies joined the industry. Some of the products, like Invisible Fence and DogWatch, made by DogWatch Inc., are sold by independent dealers who install the product and usually train the dogs (and owners).</p>
        <p>While prices vary among dealers nationally, a system enclosing a quarter-acre costs about $600 from Invisible Fences and about $900 from DogWatch. Even the most expensive hidden fence is considerably cheaper than a chain-link or wood fence.</p>
        <p>Products that are installed by the customer, who has to bury the wire around the perimeter of the property and do the dog training, cost much less. The Radio Systems Corporation of Concord, Tenn., for example, sells a system, under the PetSafe brand, that will enclose 25 acres for just under $200.</p>
        <p>Some dogs are willing to endure the punishment in order to leave the property, especially when they learn that the shock is brief. One such dog is Teddy, a 3-year-old Pomeranian-and-terrier mix owned by Renee and Gregory Abel of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''If she sees a dog walking by the yard, she doesn't care about the zap,'' Ms. Abel said. ''She'll run through it. We have to go get her, take off the collar and carry her back over the wire.'' The fence system works about 85 percent of the time, Ms. Abel said. ''I feel bad about the shock, but we'd feel worse if she got lost or hit by a car.''</p>
        <p>A hidden fence may protect a dog that is prone to roam, but it does not necessarily protect strangers approaching the yard. The dog knows where the boundary is, Dr. Houpt said, but a visitor like a letter carrier may not know that there is a fence.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bain also says that is a drawback of hidden fences. If a stranger steps into the yard, she said, the dog can become aggressive because someone is in its territory. ''The aggression can range from chasing them to biting them, depending on the dog,'' she said. ''We tell people with aggressive dogs to get a real fence,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Hidden-fence companies can tailor their fences to the needs and quirks of individual dogs and owners. Most of the companies offer collars with different shock levels, and the fences can also be used to protect flowerbeds or pools. Invisible Fence has a three-sided wire system for lakefront properties.</p>
        <p>For owners who would rather not shock their dogs, PetSafe has a collar that emits a spray of citronella instead; most dogs do not like the smell. PetSafe also offers a wireless product that keeps the dog in a 90-foot radius around the transmitter.</p>
        <p>Some dogs can outsmart a hidden fence. They have figured out that if they stand near the boundary wire to trigger the beep, the battery will eventually run out and they can come and go without a shock. In December, PetSafe will introduce a collar that is designed to discourage escapees by progressively increasing the intensity of the shock as the dog approaches the fence.</p>
        <p>Dogs can sometimes be shocked even when they are on good behavior because of interference by television signals. DogWatch has switched from the standard AM radio signal to a more precise FM signal for its transmitters to avoid that problem.</p>
        <p>Still, no matter what the companies come up with, some dogs won't stay put -- a cat across the street can become just too enticing. ''It is always better to have the dog in the house unless you can walk it on a leash,'' Dr. Houpt said. ''Yes, it's true a dog needs exercise, but probably so does its owners.''</p>
