      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial questions whether General Electric chief executive Jack Welch is worth as author record $7.1 million advance Time Warner Trade Publishing has agreed to pay him for book he will write when he retires next year; notes book will be marketed as definitive text of modern American business practices; cites his successes at GE</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>When a magazine like Fortune or Forbes conducts a survey to determine who is the most admired businessman of the year, decade or even the century, Jack Welch of General Electric invariably finishes at or near the top of the list. In his 20 years as G.E.'s chief executive officer, Mr. Welch has generated enormous wealth not only for the company's stockholders but for hundreds of companies that do business with G.E. But is Mr. Welch worth $7.1 million as a writer? That is what Time Warner Trade Publishing has agreed to advance him for a book about his career, his business philosophy and whatever else Mr. Welch chooses to write about when he retires next year. It is the biggest advance in publishing history, exceeding the up-front money paid to Colin Powell and the pope.</p>
        <p>Paying off a $7.1 million advance will require North American hardcover sales of 1.6 million books. Only one or two titles a year sell more than a million copies. A recent best seller by Microsoft's Bill Gates sold about half a million. So this is a gamble, but to some publishing executives, not nearly the gamble it seems to be. The reason is that whatever Mr. Welch writes is going to be perceived as the bible of American business.</p>

        <p>When a magazine like Fortune or Forbes conducts a survey to determine who is the most admired businessman of the year, decade or even the century, Jack Welch of General Electric invariably finishes at or near the top of the list. In his 20 years as G.E.'s chief executive officer, Mr. Welch has generated enormous wealth not only for the company's stockholders but for hundreds of companies that do business with G.E. But is Mr. Welch worth $7.1 million as a writer? That is what Time Warner Trade Publishing has agreed to advance him for a book about his career, his business philosophy and whatever else Mr. Welch chooses to write about when he retires next year. It is the biggest advance in publishing history, exceeding the up-front money paid to Colin Powell and the pope.</p>
        <p>Paying off a $7.1 million advance will require North American hardcover sales of 1.6 million books. Only one or two titles a year sell more than a million copies. A recent best seller by Microsoft's Bill Gates sold about half a million. So this is a gamble, but to some publishing executives, not nearly the gamble it seems to be. The reason is that whatever Mr. Welch writes is going to be perceived as the bible of American business.</p>
        <p>People are not going to buy it for its plot, character development or sex appeal. Unlike Chrysler's Lee Iacocca, whose story sold an astonishing 2.6 million hardcover books, Mr. Welch did not rescue a large American company from bankruptcy, nor does he have Mr. Iacocca's promotional flair. People will buy Mr. Welch's book because it will be marketed as the definitive text of modern American business practices.</p>
        <p>Does he have enough managerial wisdom to write such a bible? Mr. Welch himself would say no. But a lot of people think he has all the answers, and Time Warner is betting that there are at least 1.6 million people willing to pay good money to find out what they are. There may be other factors at work here, too, including America's growing obsession with business and the stock market. But the real come-on is Mr. Welch and his mystique.</p>
        <p>That mystique is grounded in some hard realities. He took a company with a market value slightly in excess of $12 billion and turned it into a company worth $500 billion. Along the way he sold off underperforming divisions and fired about 100,000 people, thus earning himself the name ''Neutron Jack.'' He also introduced simplicity to an excessively cumbersome system of checks and balances. G.E. was famous for, even admired for its layers of sector managers, department managers, unit managers and supervisors, all of whom were thought to be essential to strategic planning and quality control. Neutron Jack threw some ordnance at this system, and when the dust cleared he had eliminated all but four of nine hierarchical levels -- and, more important, made sure that the bosses of each of G.E.'s various businesses reported directly to him.</p>
        <p>Freed of fuzzy paternalism, the people who remained were encouraged to think for themselves and question the corporate culture, resulting not only in technological innovation but in huge cost savings. At the same time, Mr. Welch was not at all shy about borrowing good ideas when he came across them. Companies like Hewlett-Packard and Toshiba gave him tips on productivity and customer relations, and from Allied Signal and Motorola he lifted an entire system of quality control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch is not without his critics. But in an era when C.E.O.'s seem to hang around for only two or three years (see Coca-Cola, or Mattel) before the directors decide they have made a mistake, Mr. Welch's 20 years of virtually uninterrupted success inspires curiosity -- enough, Time Warner hopes, to sell 1.6 million books.</p>
