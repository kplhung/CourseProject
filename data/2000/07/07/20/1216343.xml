        <p>Before the Camp David summit meeting, pronounced dead, was buried, it came back to life in a startling turnabout suggesting that the contemplation of failure raised prospects too grim for the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to accept.</p>
        <p>After nine stormy days in which each Middle Eastern leader threatened to walk out, it was President Clinton's bag-packing that drove home the unsettling possibilities of what the future without a peace effort could hold. Mr. Clinton did not label it brinkmanship, the assembling of his motorcade, the changing from casual to formal clothes, the preparations for sealing hope for a negotiated peace agreement.</p>
        <p>But in a way it was. And somehow, the rebirth of the talks, with no guarantees of any greater success, underscored a milestone in Middle East history that got lost in the brief pronouncement of failure. During nine days at Camp David, a Palestinian leader and an Israeli leader confronted the intractable issue of Jerusalem's sovereignty, a volatile, taboo issue that Middle Eastern leaders have never before dared to broach.</p>
        <p>It is hardly surprising that the issue was responsible for derailing the summit before it climbed back on track, an issue that could not even be discussed much less resolved previously. And it won't get any easier.</p>
        <p>But the status of Jerusalem needn't be a deal-breaker if Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestine leader, Yasir Arafat, are willing or able to go for a partial accord that delays decision-making on this subject. In the first nine days, they weren't, but that meant that, before it was given a new lease on life, one of the most momentous peace summits in modern history fizzled to a close on a rainy night that dampened spirits.</p>
        <p>Until the second announcement, it seemed that instead of ending a 52-year conflict, the summit might have put in jeopardy the whole notion of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking itself. It seemed barely possible that lower-level negotiators would have been able to return home and create a profitable dynamic when their leaders had visited and revisited every compromise possible and rejected them conclusively. Perhaps it is that eventuality that turned the leaders' heads around and convinced them to stay, abetted by the ''powers of persuasion'' of President Clinton, as his spokesman described it.</p>
        <p>At around 11 p.m. Wednesday here, the summit's supposed failure greeted the Middle East region, which was about to wake up when the talks broke down. It greeted them with an uncertain future at what was supposed to be the end of a seven-year peace effort, and it raised the specter of violent confrontations, of a genuine, street-level battle for Palestinian independence building toward Mr. Arafat's pledged deadline of Sept. 13 for declaring a state.</p>
        <p>Before the decision to stay on, people were already wondering if the summit had done more harm than good or more good than harm? It was impossible to know. The meeting, which the Israelis pushed for but the Palestinians resisted, was premised on the idea of averting a violent climax to the peace process. While the Palestinians predicted failure, saying the summit was premature, the Israelis, and the Americans who eventually convened the meeting, considered it better to try than not to try amid the political and social tensions building in the region.</p>
        <p>The language in Prime Minister Barak's closing letter to President Clinton did not offer any suggestion that the summit had brought the parties closer together, despite the fact that were locked up in a presidential retreat for nine days of intimate, emotional conversations. Instead, it demonstrated, as did statements by the Palestinians, that the mutual recriminations were not only still strong but perhaps stronger than ever during Mr. Barak's tenure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat met only three times during the nine days that President Clinton spent shuttling between them, and there is no evidence that their relationship grew stronger in the bucolic setting.</p>
        <p>''It's a sad day,'' David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who has chronicled the peace effort for the last decade, said after the first announcement, the one about failure. ''Camp David was high noon for the Middle East, time to finish all the business of the 20th century, but now we will be stuck there, in the past, for the foreseeable future.''</p>
