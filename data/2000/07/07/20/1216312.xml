        <p>Sift through the speculation about Carl Pickens and shuffle past the signing of Yatil Green, and there is Wayne Chrebet, spurting through a defense like a water bug on a caffeine high, running from the questions about his height and leaving behind him prognostications that the passing game is going to be stunted now that the team's primary receiver is about the size of your average Jets fans.</p>
        <p>In the opening week of training camp, it has been impossible not to notice that Chrebet is nearly always open and that, with increasing frequency, passes are thrown to him. He is, unequivocally, the Jets' No. 1 receiver. Keyshawn Johnson can, from Tampa, derisively dismiss his ability -- Johnson said he didn't see how the offense could work if Chrebet was the go-to guy -- but with his former teammate and onetime nemesis traded away, the ''team mascot'' from the neighborhood college has morphed into the big man on campus, complete with a Superman T-shirt he borrowed from a friend and a punkish pierced eyebrow.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'This is your chance, you get to be the go-to guy,' '' Chrebet said, recounting a conversation he had this spring with Coach Al Groh. ''I said, 'Listen, this is something I've been waiting for for a long time.' I didn't want to rock the boat the last handful of years, saying I wanted more passes. I certainly wanted more opportunity, and this has given me a chance to get those.''</p>
        <p>Last season, despite missing the first five games with a broken bone in his left foot, Chrebet finished with 48 receptions for 631 yards and 3 touchdowns. He has been especially proficient on third down.</p>
        <p>In his last full season, 1998, Chrebet was third in the American Football Conference and fifth in the National Football League in third-down receptions with 26 for 412 yards.</p>
        <p>In 1997, half of his 58 receptions were on third down. Of his 331 career receptions, 111 came on third down. On 80 of them, Chrebet picked up the first down and 10 of those were for touchdowns. Groh, who first encountered Chrebet when he had to figure out how to defend against him on third down as New England's defensive coordinator, said that Chrebet ''is a little worse than annoying'' for defenses. ''He's a problem.''</p>
        <p>But Chrebet's role will expand this season. That is clear from the number of balls that are thrown to him in practice, and he has already assumed Johnson's spot as the lone receiver on the field in goal-line situations to catch fade passes.</p>
        <p>With Johnson, who drew so much of a defense's attention, gone, Chrebet is sure to encounter double coverage more frequently as the designated No. 1 receiver.</p>
        <p>Anticipating Chrebet's larger role, Groh challenged him during the off-season, telling him that his potential was still in front of him, that as far as he had come from being a veritable walk-on from Hofstra, there was still much more to do.</p>
        <p>''He's definitely hungry to go out there and prove to people he can play with the best of them,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde said.</p>
        <p>''I think my potential is unlimited,'' Chrebet said. ''Every year I've progressed a great deal. When I get to see some film from 1995 when I was a rookie, it's almost embarrassing to see what kind of player I was. I think every year I should get better.''</p>
        <p>Of course, he also must confront daily questions about his stature. Listed at 5 feet 10 inches, Chrebet appears to be even shorter. With Dedric Ward listed at 5-9, Groh is repeatedly asked if the Jets need a big receiver like Pickens, who could be released from Cincinnati as early as today, now that a dispute between the Bengals and the players association has reportedly been settled.</p>
        <p>Today, Groh pointed to the years that Gary Clark and Ricky Sanders starred as two undersized receivers for the Washington Redskins as an example that size, in this case, might not matter. Chrebet contends that his lack of height is actually an advantage, because a small, quick receiver is able to get lost in a defense. Try telling that to Johnson.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I never much listened to anything he had to say,'' Chrebet said. ''But time will certainly tell.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Linebacker BRYAN COX sat out Wednesday's practice with back spasms and right defensive end ERIC OGBOGU is out with a shoulder that pops in and out of its socket. Groh gave no indication when Ogbogu, who is competing for a starting job, will return -- he said he would sit for ''a little while'' -- and JASON WILTZ will work at end while he is out.</p>
