        <p>Bread and design make a good marriage. Just ask Ibu Poilane, the designer, left, who married France's most famous bread baker, Lionel Poilane. He swept her off her feet and transplanted her from New York to Paris. With children now in school and her husband busy baking, she has opened a shop to sell her furniture and planters, which are bronze and coated in a dark brown finish. ''Bronze is a sensual material,'' Ms. Poilane said. She describes her pieces as heavy in weight but light in line and proportion. The side table below ($17,000) is five feet long and weighs 330 pounds. The shallow bowl ($2,900) is 15 inches across and 22 pounds.
