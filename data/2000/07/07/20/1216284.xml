        <p>A Brooklyn Heights arts center celebrated for its avant-garde productions is leaving the historic church where it holds its performances because of a dispute with the church's leaders.</p>
        <p>Officials at the St. Ann Center for Restoration and the Arts say that they hope the move is temporary and that they will be able to forge an agreement with the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island, which includes Brooklyn, to return to the church.</p>
        <p>The center's exit could mark the culmination of a longstanding feud between the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, a national historic landmark, and the center, which was formed in 1980 to expand public use of the church and generate money for its preservation.</p>
        <p>Since its formation, the arts group has earned a reputation for its innovative Arts at St. Ann's performances, which have included such disparate shows as a Velvet Underground reunion, a jazz suite featuring Elvis Costello and Deborah Harry, and operas with crooning puppets. The church's stained-glass windows, the first created in this country, served as a backdrop when Lou Reed and John Cale reunited for an Andy Warhol tribute and when the cartoonist Art Spiegelman's ''Three-Panel Opera'' had its debut.</p>
        <p>The partnership of church and arts center has been lucrative, with the center raising more than $4 million over the years to restore the magnificent but crumbling church building.</p>
        <p>But the marriage between the two institutions has also been a rocky one, with the diocese increasingly seeking to strengthen its grip on the independent, secular arts center. This week, the arts center board voted to leave the church temporarily and conduct its 2000-01 season in exile, at locations scattered throughout the city. Susan Feldman, the artistic director of the center, said she was looking at sites like Town Hall and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>The conflict dates to February 1995, when the rector at the time, the Rev. Dr. Patricia Wilson-Kastner, tried to evict the center, which has been housed in the church since 1983. The move drew the ire of parishioners, and Dr. Wilson-Kastner, who has since died, was restationed.</p>
        <p>Now, church leaders, including the bishop of Long Island, Orris G. Walker, and the new rector of the parish, the Rev. Joade Dauer-Cardasis, are requesting that the arts group sign an agreement that would recast its partnership with the church. But the arts center maintains that signing such an agreement would be tantamount to surrendering its autonomy.</p>
        <p>The agreement that the church is now proposing ''would essentially transform the center's nonsectarian public service mission into a sectarian one in which the center would become a functionary organization of the church and the diocese,'' the arts center said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feldman called the church's position ''self-destructive,'' adding, ''If that building closes or they're not taking care of it, all the millions of dollars that we've put into that place, all of the window restorations, the brownstone restoration -- it's all going to be for naught.''</p>
        <p>While center officials say they hope the church drops its demands, church officials say that is unlikely. Groups that use church space must recognize that the church is ''the primary reality in the relationship,'' said Archdeacon John Greco of Nassau County, Bishop Walker's deputy. ''If any group is unwilling to accept the fact, the reality, that the church is paramount in terms of its rights and privileges, then that group would be happier elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dauer-Cardasis said that the diocese has no interest in influencing the content of Arts at St. Ann's programs and that the agreement in question would merely cast the center as the church's tenant. According to canon law, any group that uses church property must have a lease of no more than five years with the option of renewal, she said.</p>
        <p>Some people suggest that the fight has more to do with real estate prices than artistic control, an assertion that Ms. Dauer-Cardasis dismisses as ''nonsense.'' Bob Mesnard, a member of the vestry, the governing body that parishioners elect, said he suspected that the diocese was planning to sell the historic building, which would likely fall into disrepair without the help of Arts at St. Ann's.</p>
