        <p>ALAIN DUCASSE is speaking through a translator -- his girlfriend, actually -- but you really don't need a lot of language to see that this is a subject of which he has grown fatigue.</p>
        <p>The money? (This would be the $160 prix fixe dinner, before drinks and tips and tax, at his new Essex House restaurant, the priciest place in town.) Why is everyone asking about money, he says, a shadow darkening his face. The question should be, what do you get at Ducasse? What about the luxury, the excellence of the meal?</p>
        <p>Right. So whose idea was the $160?</p>
        <p>He does that great dismissive thing with the face the French do so well. Who knows? In Paris, $160 is the middle price. The top is about $200.</p>
        <p>Another attempt: Mr. Ducasse, you grew up on a goose farm. What's the most you've paid for a meal?</p>
        <p>The face softens. Mr. Ducasse recalls apprenticing with the great French chef Alain Chapel. ''It was 1977, I was making $150 a month. Le Pere Bise. It was a three-star, near Lake Annecy. There were three of us from Chapel, we were working in the back, we wanted to see what it was in the front. One meal. And it took 20 days of work to pay for it. I still have a memory, very magical. The excellence of the table, the beauty of the cutlery, le service, le luxe.''</p>
        <p>Does he remember what he ate?</p>
        <p>''Ecrevisse, chicken from Bresse, foie gras to start. We didn't take very expensive wines.'' Then back to the Essex House again. ''You know, I had a client who came to me the day of the opening. He paid $500 and sat for four hours. He was happy. When you go see the Knicks to sit on the side it's very expensive, $500, c'est fou, c'est extraordinaire, but it's a wonderful moment. Perhaps you cannot afford to go to these places every day, but what is the point of life if there is not eccentricity, if you don't do these things?''</p>
        <p>A funny thing about Mr. Ducasse: he was the first chef in 60 years to win six Michelin stars at once, three each for restaurants in Paris and Monaco, but he looks more like a banker. Conservative suit, heavy glasses. At 43, he seems 20 years older.</p>
        <p>He has 11 restaurants and he's not in the kitchen at the Essex House rattling pots and pans. Do you expect St. Laurent to stitch every piece of clothing? he likes to say. Mr. Ducasse has a cooking school, books, a line of cooking supplies and endorsements, which gross $30 million a year. In the month since his new restaurant opened, he has been around the world twice. Even now he's off somewhere, leaving Gwenaelle Gueguen, 27, his girlfriend of five years, to make small talk, explaining how they met.</p>
        <p>HE was coming to do a dinner in New York and he saw me on the airplane,'' Ms. Gueguen is saying. ''For four months he was calling. Then he asked me to be his assistant in a dinner he was preparing in L.A. I was thinking, 'He really must think I'm stupid,' but he was a perfect gentleman. In that way, he was not really behaving like a chef. They do move very fast, I think.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ducasse arrives midway in this conversation, but as it does not stop immediately, he leaves.</p>
        <p>''He's always getting up,'' says Ms. Gueguen, unperturbed.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later Mr. Ducasse returns and sits down. ''Whose interview is this?'' he says drily.</p>
        <p>This done, he discusses his life. Growing up in the southwest of France. Becoming the youngest chef in France to be awarded three Michelin stars, at the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo. Yes, it is true that he insisted his contract with the hotel state that if he did not deliver three stars within four years, he could be fired. He did not want to wait 10 years. And there were other people who wanted that contract.</p>
        <p>There would also be the controversial notion that the chef not be shackled to the stove.</p>
        <p>''The role of the chef is to train people to take care of the clients, who live in the spirit which he develops over the years,'' Mr. Ducasse says. ''The walls of the restaurant sweat his philosophy.''</p>
        <p>This seems counter to the belief that the chef makes a meal memorable, that when the chef is in a bad mood, the food suffers.</p>
        <p>''We don't have moods,'' Mr. Ducasse says. ''If we make sure of every one of the details, it will not change, it will conquer the mood. We want to be organized like a Swiss clock.''</p>
        <p>It also brings to mind Gael Greene, who did a lacerating review of Mr. Ducasse's three-star restaurants in New York magazine three years ago. Referring to Mr. Ducasse, who had taken over the Paris restaurant formerly run by Joel Robuchon, she wrote, ''We have gone from Robuchon to Robo-chef.''</p>
        <p>Now at the mention of her name,  Mr. Ducasse stiffens.</p>
        <p>''She ate in Paris and in Monaco, full meals, she didn't like anything apart from the Perrier. Rien! But happily, I'm still there. Is this to be the history of Gael Greene?''</p>
        <p>Absolument pas! Let's move to happier subjects. What did Mr Ducasse do when he won his first big rating, the two stars? ''I said, 'O.K., now how long before three?' ''</p>
        <p>O.K., what did he do when he learned he'd won three? Nothing. He was at a meeting in Monaco. Something amusing did happen afterward, though. He was speeding to interviews in Paris and the police pulled him over. But when he explained he had just been awarded three stars, of course they understood.</p>
