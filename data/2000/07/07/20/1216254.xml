        <p>Editorial scores stealthy efforts by anti-environmental senators to block Interior Department's ban on snowmobiling in national parks, ban that enjoys widespread public support</p>

        <p>Late Tuesday afternoon, the subject on the Senate floor turned to snowmobiling in the national parks. ''You will see very little variety in wildlife in Yellowstone in the wintertime,'' Senator Conrad Burns of Montana remarked. ''If you have been there, you know that about the only thing you will see is bison. Let me tell you, you don't bother them with a little old snowmobile.'' Senator Larry Craig of Idaho agreed. ''Somehow,'' he mused, ''the wildlife of Yellowstone is going through some emotional problem as a result of snowmobiles.''</p>
        <p>Senators Burns and Craig were not alone in making fun of the Interior Department's sensible and long-overdue ban on snowmobiling in the national parks, which was announced in April. And Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming,  offered an amendment to the Interior Department appropriations bill that would have torpedoed the administration's ban by ordering up one of those endless ''studies'' of the situation and by denying Interior the funds it needs to carry out the ban. Mr. Thomas later withdrew his amendment. But the clear threat was that it would resurface later this summer when the House and Senate meet in conference to resolve their differing versions of the appropriations bill.</p>

        <p>Late Tuesday afternoon, the subject on the Senate floor turned to snowmobiling in the national parks. ''You will see very little variety in wildlife in Yellowstone in the wintertime,'' Senator Conrad Burns of Montana remarked. ''If you have been there, you know that about the only thing you will see is bison. Let me tell you, you don't bother them with a little old snowmobile.'' Senator Larry Craig of Idaho agreed. ''Somehow,'' he mused, ''the wildlife of Yellowstone is going through some emotional problem as a result of snowmobiles.''</p>
        <p>Senators Burns and Craig were not alone in making fun of the Interior Department's sensible and long-overdue ban on snowmobiling in the national parks, which was announced in April. And Senator Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming,  offered an amendment to the Interior Department appropriations bill that would have torpedoed the administration's ban by ordering up one of those endless ''studies'' of the situation and by denying Interior the funds it needs to carry out the ban. Mr. Thomas later withdrew his amendment. But the clear threat was that it would resurface later this summer when the House and Senate meet in conference to resolve their differing versions of the appropriations bill.</p>
        <p>This is a typical example of the legislation-by-stealth employed by anti-environmental senators. The senators who oppose an end to snowmobiling in the parks know that the ban enjoys widespread public support and is buttressed by careful, conscientious science. Their only hope to scuttle the ban is to do so out of sight. The Interior Department's rule is and has been open for public comment. That is a far more democratic procedure than the device of sneaking a piece of substantive legislation into an appropriations bill without hearings, which is what the Westerners clearly intend to do.</p>
        <p>As for the proposed ''study,'' the issue has already been fully investigated by the Air Resources Division of the National Park Service, which concluded that snowmobiles create a disproportionately large amount of atmospheric pollution in Yellowstone. But there are other compelling reasons to ban snowmobiles. Their numbers, their noise and their ability to disrupt wildlife contradict the National Park Service's mandate to maintain, unimpaired, the natural resources of the parks.</p>
        <p>One lone Westerner, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, made yet another telling argument. He pointed out that of the 130,000 miles of designated snowmobile trails in the United States, only 600 are in national parks. That leaves 129,400 miles for the machines. That seems sufficient.</p>
