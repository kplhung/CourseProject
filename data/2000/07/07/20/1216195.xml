        <p>Everything came together in ''. . . Still We Sit,'' a little jewel of a new duet presented by Maxine Steinman on Friday night at Joyce SoHo. Choreographed and performed by Raymundo Costa and Ms. Steinman, a former soloist with Eleo Pomare, the piece was inspired by a poem by John Fuller, quoted in the program. ''It's time to go, but still we sit, lingering in our summer,'' the opening lines read. And the fragile looking Ms. Steinman and solid Mr. Costa, a handsomely complementary pair dressed in white brocade robes and pants, perfectly evoked that mystical sense of timelessness.</p>
        <p>The movement was essentially simple, ranging from pensive walks and sits to arms opening out with quiet voluptuousness. But the piece built, quietly and inexorably with the score by Henryk Gorecki so that by its end the work seemed to have said everything that needed to be said about a relationship and a moment.</p>

        <p>Everything came together in ''. . . Still We Sit,'' a little jewel of a new duet presented by Maxine Steinman on Friday night at Joyce SoHo. Choreographed and performed by Raymundo Costa and Ms. Steinman, a former soloist with Eleo Pomare, the piece was inspired by a poem by John Fuller, quoted in the program. ''It's time to go, but still we sit, lingering in our summer,'' the opening lines read. And the fragile looking Ms. Steinman and solid Mr. Costa, a handsomely complementary pair dressed in white brocade robes and pants, perfectly evoked that mystical sense of timelessness.</p>
        <p>The movement was essentially simple, ranging from pensive walks and sits to arms opening out with quiet voluptuousness. But the piece built, quietly and inexorably with the score by Henryk Gorecki so that by its end the work seemed to have said everything that needed to be said about a relationship and a moment.</p>
        <p>There were similar passages in ''Inside the Green Wall,'' a more playful and ambitious duet choreographed and performed by Ms. Steinman and Mr. Costa to music by Marlui Miranda. But the suite of duets took too much time to make its points and reiterate them, particularly coming as it did after Ms. Steinman's ''Closet,'' a relentlessly harrowing portrait of madness. Ms. Steinman and Mr. Costa are a magical match, however, and one looks forward to more of their collaborations, judiciously edited.</p>
        <p>The company also included Inga Benson, Jaime Galindo and Columbine Macher.</p>
