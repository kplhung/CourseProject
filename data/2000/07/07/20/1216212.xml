        <p>It must get lonely for a disc jockeys, barricaded behind turntables and mixers with nothing but the history of recorded music for company. That must be why they keep seeking other options.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's disc jockeys have been backing up rappers and producing albums; in the 90's they started joining rock bands. They have become performers, showing off manual dexterity and arcane techniques of vinyl manipulation as turntablists; sequestered in studios, they have become electronica programmers, building sound collages from samples and snippets of their collections. And lately they have started to lead live bands, with the disc jockey at the center, using singers and musicians as accessories to a disc jockey's notions of how music should flow.</p>
        <p>Disc jockeys as bandleaders converged last week on New York City, in coincidental bookings that suggest that this kind of human-machine interface is spreading fast. Arling and Cameron, two Dutch disc jockey-producers, headlined the Bowery Ballroom; A Guy Called Gerald and his group were at the Anchorage under the Brooklyn Bridge on Thurday night, while Carl Craig led a trio at the Knitting Factory. (World-music disc jockey bands also came to town: Badmarsh and Shri playing South Asian-topped dance music at the Anchorage on Friday night and Frederic Galliano with African musicians at Summerstage on Sunday.)</p>
        <p>With live collaborators a disc jockey onstage gives an audience something to watch. Just as important, live performers tilt music toward the present; without it, disc jockeys, by definition, are working with recorded materials, music from the past. But performers also have the limitations of flesh and blood, while a lone disc jockey can leap eras, genres, rhythms and textures with the flick of a volume control.</p>
        <p>Disc jockey bands are still in the fledgling stage. At the shows by both A Guy Called Gerald and Arling and Cameron, human collaborators didn't bring much spontaneity.</p>
        <p>Arling and Cameron are kitsch connoisseurs, digging into 1970's film soundtracks, international bubble gum pop, lounge music and other subgenres that were among the cheesy-music rediscoveries of the 1990's. Their new album, ''Music for Imaginary Films'' (Emperor Norton), moves away from happy mix-and-match anachronisms to create counterfeit kitsch: nearly convincing theme songs for nonexistent television series and B movies, mostly of 60's and 70's vintage.</p>
        <p>There's smiley neo-hippie folk-rock, spy-film jet-set music and thumping early disco, complete with deadpan innocuous lyrics that Richard Cameron intoned along with recorded tracks for the stage show. Gerry Arling played bass, flanked by a flutist and a guitarist; there were campy vintage video clips. Yet despite a few speedy guitar lines, the music was tied to its synchronized tracks and, unlike Arling and Cameron's disc jockey collages, largely trapped in one era at a time. Amusing as it was, it was an inside joke, as if Arling and Cameron had gone to all that trouble just to imitate their record collection.</p>
        <p>A Guy Called Gerald, who has been a major figure in British dance music for more than a decade, brought a drummer, a bassist and singers with him but found only circumscribed ways to use them. He produced slow, breathy chords from his electronics; the rhythm section added reggae bass lines and double-time drums like drum 'n' bass tracks; the singers provided stray phrases of melody.</p>
        <p>Later the music perked up as Gerald switched to a house beat and used a sampled vocal instead of live ones, giving him more control. Yet the songs never became either straightforward pop or the kind of open-ended, danceable excursions a disc jockey can create on his own. They were stranded in a repetitive limbo.</p>
        <p>Carl Craig was better off. As D.J. Spooky worked the turntables, playing eerie 20th-century classical music and bits of jazz, and Francisco Mora played congas, Mr. Craig deployed drumbeats, bass lines, echoes and raw distorted sounds. The music would drift into meditative hollows, then slam back to earth with another pounding beat. And its through line came not from the recorded sounds but from the live ones: Mr. Mora's congas, with sputtering Afro-Cuban rhythms and the dynamic flexibility of a human improviser.</p>
        <p>For the moment disc jockey bands are still in the experimental stage, and the human element tends to hold them back. But Mr. Craig's streamlined little ensemble showed that disc jockeys don't have to play by themselves to cover plenty of territory.</p>
