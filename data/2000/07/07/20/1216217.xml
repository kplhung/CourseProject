        <p>Steve Jobs officially unveiled the new PowerMac G4 Cube at Mac World Expo yesterday. But even before his speech, Mac fans, never shy in their ardor, couldn't contain themselves.</p>
        <p>The Cube -- the nickname that enthusiasts immediately gave the new computer -- is a 450-megahertz computer encased in an 8-inch cube. About one-quarter the size of the G4 computer that is currently on the market, the Cube sits in a clear plastic display case.</p>
        <p>''Wow'' was the exclamation of choice among Mac fans at the Javits center in New York, as people pushed and shoved one another to grab for posters that had been placed, unannounced, in an unmarked corner of the Apple booth. They had been intended for distribution after the keynote address by Mr. Jobs, Apple's chief executive. But before he finished, no posters were left.</p>
        <p>The G4 Cube has 64 megabytes of memory, ports for U.S.B. and FireWire connections and a DVD player that opens through a slot on the top. It comes with a keyboard, speakers and an optical mouse, but it doesn't include one part that is typically required in computers of that speed: a fan. Engineers have designed the machine with an air channel in the middle so the processors can be kept cool without any fan noise.</p>
        <p>The Cube also comes with another feature: with a push of a button, a handle pops up from the belly of the machine, enabling users to pull it out of its plastic case and add or subtract parts at will.</p>
        <p>It will go on sale in August for $1,799; a 500-megahertz version will also be available, for $2,299, exclusively through the company's Web site.</p>
