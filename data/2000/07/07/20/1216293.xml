        <p>Saying he alone could repair his party's deep wounds and sweep Democrats back to control of both houses of the Legislature, Senator Robert G. Torricelli said today for the first time that he was eager to run for governor of New Jersey and boasted that he had already won the backing of most of the county Democratic organizations.</p>
        <p>But in a sign that last month's bitter Senate primary might merely be replaced with another bloody intraparty conflict, Mr. Torricelli and Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, the man who until a week ago had been the lone front-runner for the Democratic nomination, dispensed with intermediaries and sniped at each other.</p>

        <p>Saying he alone could repair his party's deep wounds and sweep Democrats back to control of both houses of the Legislature, Senator Robert G. Torricelli said today for the first time that he was eager to run for governor of New Jersey and boasted that he had already won the backing of most of the county Democratic organizations.</p>
        <p>But in a sign that last month's bitter Senate primary might merely be replaced with another bloody intraparty conflict, Mr. Torricelli and Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, the man who until a week ago had been the lone front-runner for the Democratic nomination, dispensed with intermediaries and sniped at each other.</p>
        <p>For the last two weeks, Mr. Torricelli has been jockeying for support behind the scenes, but not acknowledging his intentions publicly. Today, he still shrank from officially declaring himself a candidate, but he nonetheless said he was frustrated by the slow pace of change in Washington and had reached ''the point in life where I would like to actually achieve something.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, he said the governor's office had been a lifelong ambition and denied that he saw it merely as a stepping stone to the White House.</p>
        <p>For Mr. McGreevey, who has described Mr. Torricelli as a close friend, the senator had only faint praise today. He said Mr. McGreevey had a ''tremendous future in elective or appointive office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli also made several pointed references to perceptions that Mr. McGreevey was too dependent on a few powerful state legislators for support. ''I've made it clear that people should understand that if I become a candidate for governor, there'll be no deals, no arrangements, no winks, no nods,'' he said. ''There'll be no Rasputins, no one whispering through side doors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, responded tersely with a reference to past questions about Mr. Torricelli's ethics. ''Considering Senator Torricelli's track record, that indeed is a remarkable comment,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli said he would run only if he could unify the Democratic Party's northern-central and South Jersey factions, which exploded into all-out warfare during the Senate primary between Jon S. Corzine and former Gov. Jim Florio. But in the next breath he said that ''most of the counties in northern Jersey and almost all in southern New Jersey have come together of a common mind'' to support his candidacy.</p>
        <p>He added that his supporters included Mr. Florio and former Representative William Hughes, in South Jersey, as well as Representatives Frank E. Pallone of Monmouth County and Bill Pascrell of Passaic County, and Michael Murphy, a former Morris County prosecutor. The last three, he said, are interested in challenging Mr. McGreevey themselves.</p>
        <p>''I think I can unite almost all of them,'' he said. ''Otherwise I think there's likely to be a Democratic primary of four or five candidates.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey, who has refused to abandon his own candidacy, dismissed the senator's claims of overwhelming support as ''rhetoric'' and maintained that he would prevail in a primary with Mr. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey said the senator was putting his ambitions ahead of the party's goals in the presidential and Congressional elections. ''The irony is that while Bob Torricelli allegedly discusses unity, his actions will inevitably produce a very divisive primary,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''The self-serving actions of Senator Torricelli are not premised upon electing a Democratic majority on the federal level, but only serving his personal interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli said he had been approached for months by Democrats in New Jersey but became interested only after the Senate primary. ''If these wounds are not healed, the next gubernatorial election is going to be lost,'' he said. ''There are Democrats in the southern and northern Assembly caucuses who will not go in the same room.''</p>
        <p>He even went so far as to outline the makings of a campaign platform.</p>
        <p>''The United States Senate has been enormously rewarding, and I feel I've made a real difference, but we're not making a difference on a large enough scale,'' he said. ''The point I've made is, can we actually win a sufficiently convincing victory to do things like establishing statewide day care, mandatory school instruction at age 4, buying enough open space to limit suburban sprawl, expanding our prescription drug program to include middle-income people, and establishing clinics in the state where pregnant women can get care in rural and urban areas?''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 21, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about the contest between Senator Robert G. Torricelli and Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge for the Democratic nomination for New Jersey governor misstated the context for a statement by Mr. McGreevey. Responding to Mr. Torricelli's suggestion that he was too beholden to a few powerful state lawmakers, Mr. McGreevey said, ''Considering Senator Torricelli's track record, that indeed is a remarkable comment,'' but would not elaborate. Later Mr. McGreevey said he had been implying that the senator had been just as dependent on the same legislators for his election in 1996, and that the comment was not a reference to past questions about Mr. Torricelli's ethics.</p>
