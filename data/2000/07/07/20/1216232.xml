        <p>BRITAIN: IRISH BOMB SNARLS LONDON -- A bomb planted by dissident Irish republicans on a suburban rail line brought traffic gridlock to London. Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said the bombers used a known code word in telephone warning calls from Dublin. The police shut down the rail line and safely detonated the bomb. Renegade groups have pledged a bombing campaign to protest the cooperation of the Irish Republican Army and its political party, Sinn Fein, in the Northern Ireland peace pact.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: FALLING POPULATION -- An expected 20 percent drop in the population by 2050 could only be made up for by raising the retirement age and importing millions of immigrant workers, a study by the Federal Statistics Office said. The population is expected to drop by 17 million from 82 million now, even if 100,000 more people move to Germany each year than leave. In 1950 there were twice as many people under 20 as over 60, a ratio that will be reversed by 2050.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: BASQUE OFFENSIVE CONTINUES -- Armed Basque separatists continued an offensive with the bombing of a shopping center in Vitoria, the capital of the Basque region, and a failed bid to blow up a politician's car in Malaga as he took his wife and daughter shopping. There were no injuries in either incident, the fourth and fifth in a week tied to the E.T.A. group.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: FALKLAND SUIT THROWN OUT -- The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, has ruled that it is too late for relatives of Argentine sailors killed in the Falkland war to seek compensation from Britain. The court said a claim by relatives of 2 of the 323 sailors killed in the sinking of the Argentine Navy cruiser General Belgrano, should have been made their claims within six months of the sailors' deaths in 1982. No appeal is possible.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: POLICE CRACKDOWN -- Concluding an investigation into the embezzlement of $121 million budgeted for police salaries, the Mexico City auditor barred several dozen current and former police commanders from holding public jobs in the future. The sanctions virtually decapitated the Auxiliary Police, a 40,000-officer force that serves private companies and government agencies.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: AIRPORT ALERT -- Security forces have increased patrols at the country's airports after a small bomb exploded outside a terminal at Cape Town International. No one was injured, but it was another blow to the image of the city, a leading tourist destination. In the last two years, Cape Town has been hit by a string of bombings carried out, the police suspect, by a vigilante group.</p>

        <p>KENYA: ANONYMOUS CORRUPTION -- After weeks of rowdy debate, an investigative report on corruption in Parliament was diluted as members voted to delete names of top officials and their relatives involved in the theft of hundreds of millions of public dollars. The report was known in Kenya as the ''List of Shame'' because it made allegations by name, including the vice president, George Saitoti; Trade and Tourism Minister Nicholas Biwott; a son of President Daniel arap Moi, and nearly a dozen cabinet members.</p>

        <p>KOREAS: SUMMIT FOLLOW-UP PROPOSED -- The South Korean government proposed high-level talks with the North Korean government in Seoul July 27-29 to discuss how to carry out the accord reached in the summit meeting between the two leaders of the divided peninsula last month. President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea agreed with Kim Jong Il of the North to work toward reconciliation. The follow-up talks would be the first governmental talks between the two sides in Seoul in nine years.</p>

        <p>INDIA: 3 AIDES QUIT -- Three government ministers handed in their resignations in protest at a decision to arrest Bal Thackeray, the leader of their hard-line Hindu party, Shiv Sena. But Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee refused to accept them, a spokesman said. The Maharashtra state government gave the police permission to prosecute Mr. Thackeray for his writings in a party newspaper during 1992-93 religious clashes that left thousands dead.</p>

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG ARRESTS -- Armed policemen rounded up more Falun Gong followers in Tiananmen Square on the eve of the first anniversary of the government's crackdown on the spiritual group. Plainclothes officers converged on a man who tried to unfurl a banner, bustling him into one of the many police vans that are parked around the clock on the square. Dozens of others were rounded up and the square cleared for a visit by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p>

The 10 were convicted July 1 of spying for Israel and sentenced to prison terms of from 4 to 13 years. Three others were acquitted.
