        <p>Paul Young, a British rock singer who sang with the group Mike and the Mechanics, died on Saturday at his home in Altrincham, near Manchester, England. He was 53.</p>
        <p>The cause apparently was a heart attack, said a British representative of Mr. Young and the band.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, one of two British pop singers with that name (the other one is noted for the 1985 hit ''Every Time You Go Away''), sang with a number of blues-rock bands in the 60's and was a founding member of the Manchester group Sad Cafe in the mid-70's. The group's combination of bluesy romps and commercial soft rock earned a number of hits in Britain, including ''Run Home Girl,'' ''Babylon'' and ''Everyday.''</p>
        <p>In 1985 Mr. Young was invited by Mike Rutherford, the bassist in Genesis, then on hiatus, to sing in a new group, Mike and the Mechanics. The group would feature two lead voices, Mr. Young's conventional rock approach and the soulful croon of Paul Carrack, who had sung in Squeeze.</p>
        <p>Mike and the Mechanics' first album, released late in 1985, contained the hit song ''All I Need Is a Miracle,'' which featured Mr. Young and came to be his signature stage number. But the group's biggest hit was ''The Living Years,'' sung by Mr. Carrack on the group's 1988 album of the same name.</p>
        <p>The group has carried on sporadically over the years, releasing a total of six albums.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young is survived by his wife, three children and one grandchild.</p>
