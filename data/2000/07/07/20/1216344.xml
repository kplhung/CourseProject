        <p>A 10-year-old boy was critically injured yesterday when he fell five stories from a roof in Washington Heights while chasing a ball, the police said. The boy, Luis Santiago, underwent surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Center last night, said Lt. Dennis Cirillo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Luis was playing with his 9-year-old brother and two cousins on the roof of his apartment building at 598 West 177th Street around 5:30 p.m. when their ball went over the low wall of the roof, Lieutenant Cirillo said. Luis apparently thought there was a landing on the other side of the wall and climbed over to jump down to it and retrieve the ball, the other boys told the police.</p>

        <p>A cousin who knew that a sheer drop was on the other side of the wall ran over to stop Luis, Lieutenant Cirillo said. The cousin managed to grab Luis's sneaker, but it came off in his hand, the lieutenant said.</p>
        <p>Luis grabbed a cable as he started to fall, Lieutenant Cirillo said, but the boy still fell more than 50 feet to the ground.</p>
        <p>Luis suffered a fractured skull, a broken leg and arm, and internal injuries, Lieutenant Cirillo said. He was in critical but stable condition last night.</p>
