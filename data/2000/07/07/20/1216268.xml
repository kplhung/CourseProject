        <p>The Senate today overwhelming voted to permit pharmacies and wholesale distributors of prescription drugs to import and sell American-made medicine that originally had been exported to foreign countries.</p>
        <p>But in voting 74 to 21 to overturn the ban on such imports, the lawmakers also unanimously adopted an amendment requiring the Food and Drug Administration to certify that the action would pose no risk to public health and safety and would significantly reduce costs to consumers.</p>
        <p>The amendment sponsored by Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican, could delay lifting the ban by tying up the food and drug agency  in an extensive rule-making exercise to determine precisely how it would guarantee the safety and low cost of imported drugs that are reimported.</p>
        <p>Given the possibility of delay, supporters of the measure emphasized its symbolic importance. Regardless of whether it becomes law, the measure's backers say the vote in the Senate, along with a vote approving a similar measure in the House last week, sends a strong signal to the pharmaceutical industry that it must do something about its prices.</p>
        <p>''This is a shot across the bow,'' said Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican from Vermont who is the chief Senate sponsor of the measure.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Jeffords's legislation becomes law, drug manufacturers said, consumers might not see any savings because there was no assurance that pharmacists and wholesalers would pass on the lower prices.</p>
        <p>Today's action in the Senate and the similar action last week in the House came on amendments to a bill to finance the operations of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>The amendments vary slightly,  but would have the same effect. The differences are to be reconciled in a Senate-House conference.</p>
        <p>Because the legislation is an amendment to a spending bill, even its supporters acknowledge that it could be dropped in the give and take of negotiations with the White House at the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Both measures cover the importation into the United States of prescription medications that have been produced here or in foreign pharmaceutical plants approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Proponents of the measure have argued that pharmaceutical companies often get tax breaks for developing drugs, then charge much more in the United States than in foreign countries for the same drug.</p>
        <p>Opponents say that ending the ban would result in a flood of cheap, counterfeit imports because there is no way the food and drug agency can police the way drugs are stored, transported or produced abroad.</p>
        <p>''If it's coming from Canada, that's not a bad deal,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, a Democrat of Louisiana. ''But this amendment is not limited to Canada. We'd be importing from third world countries.''</p>
        <p>The Senate action responds to pleas by the elderly, the country's most politically active demographic group, which has in recent years expressed concern about the high cost of prescription medicine.</p>
        <p>Because countries like Canada subject prescription medicines to price controls, popular drugs like Lipitor, the anti-cholesterol medication and Prozac, the anti-depressant, cost much less there -- in some cases half as much.</p>
        <p>Federal law says that a prescription drug made in the United States and exported may not be reimported except by the manufacturer. The law, adopted in 1988, sought to choke off a ''gray market'' for drugs that were counterfeit, adulterated or too old to be used safely.</p>
        <p>The 1988 measure, introduced by Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, was widely seen as a consumer protection measure. Congressional investigators documented many cases in which counterfeit drugs, including birth control pills, had been imported.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Congress last year, Dr. David A. Kessler, the former commissioner of food and drugs, said, ''The dangers of allowing re-importation of prescription drugs may be even greater today than they were in 1986.'' With the rise of Internet pharmacies, he said, ''the opportunities for illicit distribution of adulterated and counterfeit products have grown well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jeffords tried to address such concerns. His amendment says that the Department of Health and Human Services, in allowing pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs, must establish safeguards to protect public health and to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the imported products.</p>
        <p>Support for such legislation has increased along with the cost of prescription drugs. In an interview, Representative Bernard Sanders, independent of Vermont, said, ''Safety is a legitimate issue, but because of the high price of drugs, hundreds of thousands of elderly sick people cannot afford to fill the prescriptions they receive.'' Mr. Sanders has been pushing legislation to allow access to low-cost foreign drugs since May 1999.</p>
        <p>In newspaper advertisements in the last few days, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, representing major drug companies, expressed alarm at Mr. Jeffords's proposal.</p>
        <p>Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, denounced the advertisements. ''The pharmaceutical industry wants to scare people into believing the legislation is bad for consumers,'' he said. ''We would assure the safety of the drug supply, but we would also assure consumers they can have access to drugs that are priced reasonably.''</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said tonight that the administration had not opposed Mr. Jeffords's amendment. But Mr. Jennings said Congress ought to provide money to the food and drug agency so that it can assure the safety and purity of imported drugs.</p>
