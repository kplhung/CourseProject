        <p>The Colosseum, the infamous arena of combat and slaughter, is back in business for the first time in 1,500 years. Only instead of cheering for gladiators and hungry lions, contemporary Romans are paying to see a more ancient and somewhat more high-minded form of entertainment, ''Oedipus Rex.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's world premiere, a new production of the Sophocles tragedy performed by the National Theater of Greece, was a daring experiment in putting Rome's most famous ancient monument in the service of culture. Just building a stage over the yawning pit of ruins required five years of study and restoration work by an international team of archaeologists and engineers, who reconstructed a wood floor over a portion of the ruined corridors and underground tunnels where gladiators, stagehands and caged beasts once waited for the show to begin.</p>
        <p>The experiment also required a leap of faith by Greek actors, accustomed to performing in smaller, more accommodating and acoustically correct theaters. ''The Colosseum was a place designed to kill people,'' Grigoris Valtinos, the actor who plays Oedipus, said somewhat nervously before Tuesday's dress rehearsal. ''And now it is killing us.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, however, the actors were clearly audible and visible tonight on a stage and narrow wooden crossing set like a bridge along the length of the Colosseum. But the V.I.P. audience had more difficulty. The lighting was too dim for the audience to read the Italian translation that was distributed. A few hardy souls fired up cigarette lighters in an effort to follow the plot. But just being inside the ghostly walls provided its own theatrical thrill.</p>
        <p>The idea of staging a performance at the Colosseum during 2000, a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church, came from Italy's Istituto Nazionale del Dramma Antico, an organization dedicated to staging classic works in ancient settings.</p>
        <p>''Sophocles,'' performed in modern Greek, is not the usual summer fare, however. ''We wanted to break away from the usual and stage something that would represent the voyage of mankind,'' Walter Le Moli, president of the institute, explained. When he and his colleagues first talked of using the Colosseum, they didn't know its floor was being restored, serendipity that made tonight's performance possible.</p>
        <p>For Italy's millennium celebrations, the institute selected what it calls the ''Sophocles Project,'' a series of plays by the Greek playwright starting with ''Oedipus Rex,'' which runs through Friday. Mr. Le Moli said it made thematic sense to have a Greek company perform what he described as ''man's search for identity -- the first play from which all other drama descends.''</p>
        <p>It will be followed by ''Antigone,'' to be performed in late July by an Iranian theater company, the Dramatic Arts Center of Tehran. The play stresses, as Mr. Le Moli put it, ''the conflict between religious and civil authority.'' The cycle ends in August with ''Oedipus at Colonus,'' an operatic version of Sophocles's play with music by Mendelssohn.</p>
        <p>''Oedipus at Colonus,'' a play that deals with Oedipus's death in exile, was originally supposed to be performed by the Kameri Theater of Tel Aviv. The organizers hoped to link the play's theme with the Jews' search for a promised land. Those ambitious cross-cultural notions ran aground, however.</p>
        <p>The Iranian government resisted committing to the project, apparently unwilling to have its players perform if Israelis were included in the program. The point became moot, however, after the Israeli company was forced to pull out because of translation delays and scheduling conflicts. Instead, Italian actors, accompanied by an Italian orchestra and chorus, will perform the play.</p>
        <p>The National Theater of Greece, which in past years has brought ''Medea'' and ''Electra'' to New York, will take ''Oedipus Rex'' to City Center in Manhattan in October. There, instead of relying on translations printed in librettos, audiences will be able to follow the play by reading English supertitles. That concession to American convenience puzzles some of the performers. ''Like a pop music show,'' said Jenny Gaitanapoulou, who plays Jocasta, the mother of Oedipus. ''Only I am not Celine Dion.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gaitanapoulou, who usually works at the National Theater of Cyprus, nevertheless displayed a shrewd sense of contemporary American culture. To prepare for her role as a powerful and at times ruthless matriarch, the actress explained, ''I based my interpretation of Jocasta on Elizabeth I, Queen Gertrude in 'Hamlet' and Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>The stage, set atop the new wood flooring that covers only one-seventh of the Colosseum's arena, is small and dwarfed by the vast marble and brick curves of the ruins beyond it. The archaeologists' concerns limited seating to 300 people. Another 400 spectators were allowed to stand. The set will come down at the end of the summer, but the floor will stay, and there is the possibility of staging more small cultural events. Government officials, however, rule out a large rock concert.</p>
        <p>Tonight's performance was a theatrical debut for the Colosseum, which was begun under Emperor Vespasian in A.D. 72 and finished under Titus in A.D. 80. The Colosseum last saw a Roman-style spectacle -- wild animals being slaughtered -- in A.D. 523. (Gladiator fights were ended in 407.) A series of earthquakes badly damaged the building, and at times it was used as a quarry. In the 18th century Pope Benedict XIV, who had a conservationist streak, put an end to such scavenging by consecrating the Colosseum to the passion of Jesus, which helped feed the legends of the Colosseum as a site of Christian martyrdom.</p>
        <p>Historians say there is no evidence that early Christians were martyred there, let alone fed to the lions. Many, however, are reluctant to rule it out. ''It was a prime place for public executions, and there is no reason to believe Christians were excluded from the slaughter,'' explained Adriano La Regina, Rome's superintendent of archaeology, who oversaw the reconstruction work. ''It may not show up in the texts because Romans took it for granted.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago the restoration unearthed a marble plaque with an inscription that had been covered over centuries ago. The plaque explained that the construction was paid for with booty taken from the sack of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</p>
        <p>Vassilis Papavasiliou, the director, said that while it was challenging to stage ''Oedipus Rex'' in the Colosseum, it was also oddly fitting. ''Oedipus is a deeply human story, the story of all of us, and we are all children of this society,'' he said. ''The Colosseum used combat as entertainment. Our chosen form of combat here is Sophocles, an effort to restore meaning to entertainment.''</p>
