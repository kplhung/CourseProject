        <p>A Sporting Chance</p>
        <p>Q. I have a 20-year-old euonymus plant whose leaves are green with an off-white border. Recently, I found three branches with solid green leaves -- and no border. What is the explanation?</p>
        <p>A. There is no particular cause; it's just a matter of odds. If you grow enough variegated plants long enough, you're bound to see it happen sooner or later.</p>

        <p>A Sporting Chance</p>
        <p>Q. I have a 20-year-old euonymus plant whose leaves are green with an off-white border. Recently, I found three branches with solid green leaves -- and no border. What is the explanation?</p>
        <p>A. There is no particular cause; it's just a matter of odds. If you grow enough variegated plants long enough, you're bound to see it happen sooner or later.</p>
        <p>The leaves on the ancestor of your euonymus were solid green. At the growing point of every branch are three well-organized cell layers that contribute to the growth of leaves, stems and fruit. A random genetic mutation in the middle layer, which controls production of chlorophyll, resulted in a sport -- a branch that differs from the rest of the plant. An observant plant breeder took cuttings and propagated the branch, resulting in a variegated euonymus.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the new sport, showing a reversion to all-green, isn't the result of another mutation. Dr. Dennis Werner, a plant breeding expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, said that occasionally in a branch, the lower-cell layer, with normal genes, swaps places with the middle layer, and the leaves go back to being all green. Perhaps the switch is just a reaction to the boredom that comes with doing the same job day after day.</p>
        <p>Salting the Roses</p>
        <p>Q. I read somewhere about putting Epsom salts around rosebushes. Is this a good idea and if so, how much should I use, how often and when during the year?</p>
        <p>A. While Epsom salts belong on every gardener's shelf, their primary use is in the bath after a hard day bending and digging.</p>
        <p>Now, there are many gardeners who swear by the salts for their roses or spinach. And perhaps they do help sometimes, because Epsom salts contain magnesium and sulfur, two essential micronutrients. Magnesium is found in chlorophyll, which helps plants turn sunshine into food, and sulfur is used to make several proteins. If your soil was deficient in one of these elements, Epsom salts might do some good, but most plant nutritionists say that average garden soil contains enough sulfur and magnesium in forms that are readily available to the plants to keep everyone happy and healthy.</p>
        <p>A Bud Off the Old Block</p>
        <p>Q. We have a large crab-apple tree with white flowers and tiny apples in late summer. Pictures show that it was already mature in 1944, but I think it is not in good health now. Last summer, a large bough died, and the bark on the trunk doesn't look good. If it dies I've no way to order a new one, because I have no idea what variety it is. I wonder if I can propagate a new small tree to replace it. Could you suggest how I might do it?</p>
        <p>A. Call your local county cooperative extension to find someone familiar with propagating roses or fruit trees, where bud grafting is common, to do it for you. That would be the best  method, said Tom Simpson, whose Simpson Nursery in Vincennes, Ind.,  has bred some favorite crab apples, including Indian Magic, Brandywine and Centurion. Starting a cutting from a branch would be difficult at best, requiring a greenhouse, misting system and luck. Many varieties just won't root, and without knowing what you have, Mr. Simpson didn't think that trying would be worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Bud grafting takes practice. A leaf bud (the small tissue structure from which a leaf grows) is carefully cut away and then inserted just under the bark on the trunk of a closely related tree, like another crab apple or an apple. This tree, called the rootstock, is chosen for its hardiness and provides support and a root system for the grafted bud, which grows up to be just like your original crab apple.</p>
