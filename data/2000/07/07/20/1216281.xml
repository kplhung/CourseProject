        <p>Edison Schools, the country's largest  school management company, and the Museum for African Art are negotiating with city officials to build a combined corporate headquarters, school and museum at the northeast corner of Central Park, at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street.</p>
        <p>The project would transform one of the few vacant parcels of land around Central Park. It calls for the construction of the multiuse building on the block of Fifth Avenue that stretches from 109th to 110th streets.</p>
        <p>Edison, which has contracts to operate 108 schools in 21 states, would move its headquarters there from Midtown Manhattan as well as open a public or charter school that it would manage; the museum would relocate from SoHo. Edison disclosed the proposal in documents filed with federal securities officials earlier this month.</p>
        <p>If the plan is successful, the development would extend Fifth Avenue's museum district further into Spanish Harlem, putting a unique cultural stamp on one of the four corners of Central Park, a site whose views of Harlem Meer make it one of the park's most beautiful and natural locations.</p>
        <p>The project would contribute economic muscle to a neighborhood that generally has not benefited from the boom enjoyed by the city and most of the country and make Edison, whose annual revenues are $225 million, one of the largest corporations to locate in a relatively poor section of the city.</p>
        <p>Negotiations by the company and the museum to buy four city-owned parcels of land at the site are in the early stages, city officials said, and the project faces several obstacles, including obtaining changes in zoning regulations for the site. The property is currently zoned for residential and community facility use, which would permit the development of the museum and the school but not the office space.</p>
        <p>But, officials at City Hall and city agencies involved in the negotiations say the project has significant merits.</p>
        <p>''This is a creative project that offers a lot for the neighborhood and the city,'' said Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor for planning, education and cultural affairs. ''We're interested in it but no final decision has been made.''</p>
        <p>For Edison, the project fills several long-term goals, said Benno C. Schmidt Jr., the company's chairman, as Edison has long wanted to have a school as part of its headquarters, giving its curriculum development experts and instructional training staff a laboratory in which to test ideas and allowing visitors a chance to see the company in action, he said.</p>
        <p>Currently, Edison operates no schools in New York City. Its first school in New York State, a charter school in Rochester, is scheduled to open in the fall. The school at the proposed development would not open until 2003 at the earliest, Mr. Schmidt said.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Schmidt said, the company has wanted to put its headquarters in a diverse, urban neighborhood like that in which many of its schools operate, and to create a partnership with a cultural institution that is relevant to those communities. Edison's agreement with the museum states its intent not only to raise money for the development, but also to help the museum raise $10 million for its endowment.</p>
        <p>''We're enthusiastic about the project, but also realistic about the complexity of working through the necessary approvals,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''That particular location stands as a crossroads between the Latino and the African-American communities, which made it a perfect location in terms of representing the communities that are our partners around the country.''</p>
        <p>That crossroads is best symbolized by the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, the location of Duke Ellington Circle, formerly known as Frawley Circle, where a statue of Duke Ellington towers over a public plaza. Later this summer, the City Council is expected to approve a resolution to rename West 110th Street after Tito Puente, the late band leader and percussionist known as El Rey, who grew up on the street.</p>
        <p>But that intersection of black and Latino cultures also symbolizes some of the controversy that is likely to swirl around the project. Philip Reed, the City Council member whose East Harlem district includes the site, said that he was impressed that a company like Edison recognizes the neighborhood as an attractive place to build its corporate headquarters. But he questioned whether the Museum for African Art is the appropriate cultural institution for a community that is predominantly Hispanic.</p>
        <p>While the Museo del Barrio is a few blocks south of the site, on Fifth Avenue at 105th Street, he said, ''there really hasn't been the proper acknowledgment of the Latino culture of the neighborhood'' in its cultural institutions and public spaces.</p>
        <p>But State Senator Olga A. Mendez, whose district encompasses the site, embraced the project.</p>
        <p>''This would be the kind of museum which people, whether they are African-American or not, could enjoy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A museum spokeswoman said it, like Edison, wanted to be located in a community with a significant population of African-Americans, and she noted that many immigrants to the United States from the Caribbean have roots in Africa.</p>
        <p>Edison and the museum are negotiating with the Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit development company that works closely with the city, for the purchase of the city-owned land.</p>
        <p>Situated on part of that land is the Nueva Esperanza Garden, a community garden sponsored by the city Parks and Recreation Department's Green Thumb project. Last spring, state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer obtained a state court injunction prohibiting the city from selling or physically altering any of the remaining community gardens.</p>
        <p>Edison has already signed a contract to buy the recently cleared portion of the property at 109th Street and Fifth Avenue for $10 million from Castle Senior Living, a company in Teaneck, N.J.</p>
        <p>Preliminary plans for the proposed project, which city officials say would create 400 permanent jobs and about 480 construction jobs, call for a building of up to 249,000 square feet, housing the museum, an elementary school and the offices of Edison and non-profit community organizations.</p>
