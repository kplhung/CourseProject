        <p>At no time was the D-word uttered during the Tour de France today. On a day when Lance Armstrong maintained his lead while two other well-known racers dropped out of the event, a handful of the 20 teams were tested for drugs. Armstrong and the race's eight other top riders passed the surprise blood test taken in their hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>The D-word was not voiced thereafter, so at least verbally in this 87th Tour de France, drugs are nonexistent. But in the next few months, urine samples that have been taken daily from the stage winner, the overall leader and two riders selected at random will be subject to a new examination developed at the French national drug testing laboratory. The samples, which are flown daily to the laboratory outside Paris, have been frozen.</p>

        <p>At no time was the D-word uttered during the Tour de France today. On a day when Lance Armstrong maintained his lead while two other well-known racers dropped out of the event, a handful of the 20 teams were tested for drugs. Armstrong and the race's eight other top riders passed the surprise blood test taken in their hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>The D-word was not voiced thereafter, so at least verbally in this 87th Tour de France, drugs are nonexistent. But in the next few months, urine samples that have been taken daily from the stage winner, the overall leader and two riders selected at random will be subject to a new examination developed at the French national drug testing laboratory. The samples, which are flown daily to the laboratory outside Paris, have been frozen.</p>
        <p>Once the new testing technique is medically, and thus legally, approved -- as it was not before the Tour started on July 1 -- the names of those detected using such illegal performance-enhancing drugs as EPO will be announced and the riders will be stripped of their honors, if any.</p>
        <p>The testing is the latest step in an understated official effort to prove the goodwill and integrity of the Tour and the cycling union after the drug scandal that plagued the race in 1998.</p>
        <p>But today the focus was on Erik Dekker. A Dutchman with the Rabobank team, Dekker won his third stage in a mass sprint finish into Lausanne, easily beating Erik Zabel, a German with Telekom, in second place, and Fred Rodriguez, an American with Mapei, in third.</p>
        <p>The way Dekker was rolling today, he might even win the customary sprint on the Champs-Elysees on Sunday. He completed the 155-kilometer (96.3-mile) run from Evian les Bains in 3 hours 24 minutes 53 seconds, a speed of 45 kilometers an hour (28 miles an hour).</p>
        <p>The stage began and ended on opposite sides, French and then Swiss, of Lake Geneva, which was dotted with sail and motorboats, their wakes shimmering in a hot sun.</p>
        <p>Armstrong, the American leader of the United States Postal Service team, continued in the yellow jersey of overall top dog, 5:37 ahead of Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom, and 6:38 ahead of Joseba Beloki, a Spaniard with Festina.</p>
        <p>Fifty-seven riders among the 130 left in the Tour finished in the same time as the leaders, with the rest left behind to admire the nearby vineyards climbing the hills on stone terraces in the Swiss manner.</p>
        <p>There were two significant dropouts: Marco Pantani, the Italian leader of Mercatone Uno, the winner of two mountain stages, the Tour champion in 1998 and the highest name on Armstrong's hit list, failed to start because of a reported case of dysentery. He faded badly in the mountains Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The other casualty was Alex Zulle, a Swiss with Banesto, who finished second over all to Armstrong last year. Seeking to move up a notch, he changed his entire training regime for the Tour and has been invisible since the start. As the stage passed Swiss alpine meadows where newly cut hay scented the air green, Zulle apparently thought of his nearby home and dropped out.</p>
