        <p>A man the police say killed the owner of a Korean nightclub in Manhattan early Saturday in an argument over a $980 bill has been arrested in California and was on his way back to New York last night, a law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>Less than 24 hours after the shooting at the popular Dae Tong Ryung club in Midtown, the suspect, Young Min Kwak, 26, fled to San Jose, officials said, but Manhattan detectives learned his destination and alerted the police there, who were waiting for him when he landed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, of 33-32 150th Place in Flushing, Queens, is expected to be arraigned today on second-degree murder charges in the killing of Sang Dal Choi, 43, inside his club in the basement of 6 East 32nd Street, the official said. Mr. Young waived extradition, and has made statements to detectives about his role in the killing, the official said.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Young was enraged by the bill, but one of his three companions paid the $980 tab with a credit card. Then Mr. Young drew a 9-millimeter pistol and fired six shots, hitting the club owner three times, the official said. One shot grazed Mr. Sang's wife. The club was pronounced dead soon after at Bellevue Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>One investigator said Mr. Young had consumed more than an entire bottle of Scotch and was so drunk  that he also tried to shoot a busboy from three or four feet away, but  missed. ''If he wasn't so drunk, he probably would have killed three or four people,'' the investigator said.</p>
        <p>Detectives from Midtown South Precinct and Manhattan South Homicide Task Force were unsure yesterday why Mr. Young shot Mr. Sang  after the bill had been paid, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>''What happened is, this kid has done this before, where he has refused to pay,'' the law enforcement official said, referring to Mr. Young. ''He did it this time, and the owner confronted him,'' even though a companion paid the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, who works in computer graphics and animation, told detectives that he threw the gun into an empty lot in Queens, but they were unable to find it, one investigator said. The police believe the gun was bought in Kansas or Missouri, and  are trying to trace its origins.</p>
        <p>Just hours after the killing, the police learned that Mr. Young was heading to San Jose, where his sister lives, the authorities said. The police in San Jose held him until New York detectives arrived later. Yesterday, Detective Anthony Castiglia of the Midtown South Precinct and another investigator were returning to New York with Mr. Young.</p>
