        <p>In an announcement intended to remove the prime rationale for an American missile defense plan, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said today that North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into space.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin announced the offer after a meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with that country's leader, Kim Jong Il. The visit was a first for a Russian president and was part of an intensive round of Asian diplomacy aimed at mobilizing opposition to the American antimissile plan. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin signed a joint statement with the Chinese denouncing the United States' plans for a missile defense.</p>
        <p>The United States responded to the announcement today by saying it hoped to clarify the North Korean offer when Mr. Putin meets Western leaders at a meeting of the world's leading industrial countries in Okinawa, Japan, starting Friday.</p>
        <p>A senior American official said Washington could not agree to the offer if it meant putting Western missile technology in North Korean hands. But he said the United States would be willing to explore an arrangement in which North Korea's satellites would be brought to other nations to be launched into space.</p>
        <p>After meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Putin implied that North Korea had offered to give up the testing, development and production of missiles. What North Korea is seeking in return was not entirely clear, but Mr. Putin suggested that it was not just launch services that would be provided by other nations, but foreign rocket boosters that would be brought to North Korea so that it could launch satellites into space.</p>
        <p>The United States has repeatedly urged North Korea to stop the development, production and sale of missiles. North Korea has halted flight tests as part of an understanding with Washington, but has not previously suggested that it might stop making missiles.</p>
        <p>Leon V. Sigal, a specialist on northeast Asia at the Social Science Research Council in New York, said the North Korean offer signaled a willingness to reach an accommodation with the United States. ''North Korea's basic strategy is to use its missile program to move its relationship with the United States away from one of hostility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>North Korea's missile offer, Mr. Sigal noted, appeared to be an echo of the nuclear deal North Korea had struck previously with the Clinton administration. Under that arrangement, North Korea agreed to shut down its plutonium-producing reactor at Yongbyon, which had been a major worry for Western experts who feared the plutonium was being used for nuclear bombs. In return, the West agreed to provide North Korea with two light-water nuclear reactors, which would supply electricity but are far less useful for making nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>But Kurt Campbell, a former senior Pentagon official with responsibility for Asia and the Pacific, doubted the West would provide rocket boosters to North Korea.</p>
        <p>''The technology would be transferable,'' he said. ''Japan would be anxious, and there is still much that we don't understand about what is going on in North Korea.''</p>
        <p>The North Korean offer comes at a critical time. The United States is nearing a decision on whether to build a missile defense system. It is engaged in sensitive talks with Pyongyang about its missile program. And relations have begun to thaw on the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere in recent missile talks between the United States and North Korea was businesslike, although there was no breakthrough. The Clinton administration has sought to persuade North Korea to abandon its sale of missile technology, offering assistance in agriculture and public health in return.</p>
        <p>North Korea, in contrast, has demanded $1 billion a year for stopping missile exports. And it has insisted that it will continue to develop missiles for its own defense, a stance that seemed at variance with the proposal announced today.</p>
