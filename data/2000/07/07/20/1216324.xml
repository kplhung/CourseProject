        <p>CNet Networks said yesterday that it would acquire Ziff-Davis, a trailblazer in the technology magazine industry, and its Internet subsidiary, ZDNet, for $1.6 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Executives at both companies characterized the deal as an outgrowth of their ''shared common vision'' to provide online consumers with critiques of the latest technology, a niche CNet has exploited to become one of the more profitable Internet companies. The combined company is expected to be the Internet's eighth-largest property, with 16.6 million users, roughly 22 percent of the United States audience.</p>
        <p>The deal signals the degree to which CNet, an upstart in the days when Ziff-Davis was a formidable presence in the technology industry, has managed to surpass its main rival, from which it took many of its early cues.</p>
        <p>Ziff-Davis, the onetime owner of PC Magazine and MacWorld, had an online presence a decade before CNet. In 1985, long before most Americans started going online, PC Magazine introduced an interactive reader service, which evolved into ZDNet by the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>CNet, by contrast, began with a television program on USA Networks in 1995, followed by its first foray onto the Web a few months later. But the company quickly went public in 1996, becoming one of the first Internet companies to do so, beating ZDNet by three years.</p>
        <p>That early offering, analysts say, helped CNet raise the money to buy 10 companies over the last year alone, including the $700 million purchase in January of MySimon.com, an online comparison shopping service.</p>
        <p>Acquiring ZDNet gives CNet a way to increase its audience at a time when the Internet is fast approaching saturation, analysts say. In addition to a widely recognized name, ZDNet is a leading technology portal in Europe, especially in France, Germany and Britain, where CNet wants to expand.</p>
        <p>''They're buying additional customers rather than trying to steal them away,'' said Robert Martin, senior Internet analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Company. ''It's a good way of extending their lead in market share.''</p>
        <p>Under the deal, CNet will exchange 0.3397 share for each share of Ziff-Davis and 0.5932 share for each share of ZDNet, a separately traded company in which Ziff-Davis is the majority owner. Softbank, a Japanese investment group, owns a majority stake in Ziff-Davis.</p>
        <p>Ziff-Davis was particularly ripe for acquisition, having become a shell of the company known for its magazines and for putting on Comdex, the giant computer trade show. Last year, Softbank said it intended to sell or spin off the company's non-Internet components, pursuing its strategy to become the world's largest Internet investor.</p>
        <p>Since then, a rapid, but piecemeal breakup of Ziff-Davis has ensued, starting with the $205 million sale of its cable television channel, ZDTV, last November. One month later, the company announced the sale of its magazine division to Willis Stein &amp; Partners L.P. for $780 million. Then, in March, Ziff-Davis executives disclosed plans to spin off the company's trade show business in an initial public offering scheduled for August.</p>
        <p>If the offering goes through, Ziff-Davis's remaining assets would be ZDNet, two technology magazines -- Computer Shopper and a stake in Red Herring -- and a Web site, SmartPlanet, all of which would be included in the sale to CNet.</p>
        <p>Because many investors see ZDNet and CNet both as catering to computer consumers, the deal raised concerns that advertisers would have less incentive to buy space on two Web sites owned by the same company. Advertising represents about two-thirds of CNet's revenue and roughly three-fourths of ZDNet's.</p>
        <p>The companies tried to assuage these concerns by pointing out that only 25 percent of their top advertisers overlapped and that they shared a relatively small percentage of the same users. Whereas ZDNet provides product information to technology-savvy computer users, CNet caters to a more mainstream audience that is often uncomfortable with highly technical terms.</p>
        <p>Still, some analysts raised objections to what appeared to be a deviation from CNet's effort to wean itself from conventional advertising like banner ads, a staple in ZDNet's revenue stream. In recent years, CNet has focused on building its capacity to link its customers directly to sales of the products it reviews, an income strategy that many regard as integral to its future, but one that ZDNet has been slow to adopt.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, Ziff-Davis was what CNet was trying to get away from,'' said Matthew Finick, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners L.L.C.</p>
        <p>One potential sticking point on the deal is content for ZDNet. When Willis Stein bought the magazine division, which then became Ziff-Davis Media Inc., the companies negotiated a three-year contract through which the magazines supply content for ZDNet exclusively. But yesterday, executives for Ziff-Davis Media, the sixth-largest magazine publisher in the United States, said that they were still in the dark on what provisions had been made to extend that contract to CNet once it took over.</p>
        <p>''We have not seen the details of the deal and so it is difficult to comment about specifics right now,'' Elizabeth Estroff, a spokeswoman for Ziff-Davis Media, said yesterday. ''But for now, it's go forward, business as usual.''</p>
        <p>But James D. Dunning Jr., one of the partners in the acquisition of the Ziff-Davis magazines, said, ''We had no contact in this transaction.'' He added that Daniel L. Rosensweig, the chief executive of ZDNet, who will become CNet's president, and Shelby W. Bonnie, the chief executive of CNet, had called to schedule meetings to discuss the issue.</p>
        <p>Ziff-Davis executives said that they expected Mr. Dunning, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, to press the two executives for a better deal. Ziff-Davis Media will receive at least $7 million this year for providing its content to ZDNet, at least $9 million next year and at least $11 million in 2002.</p>
        <p>Most important, Ziff-Davis Media executives said they must sign off on the final agreement between CNet and ZDNet, so their satisfaction with the terms is vital to the deal.</p>
        <p>Shares of CNet fell $2.50, or 8 percent, to $29.6875. Ziff-Davis rose $2.1094, or 18 percent, to $13.4844, while ZDNet climbed $4, or 31 percent, to $16.875.</p>
