        <p>HE is 68 now. He doesn't caddie anymore, but every day shortly before noon he is in the Dunvegan Hotel bar, perched next to the door. With a mischievous smile, he said, ''I try to get here eight days a week,'' and behind him was a small brass plate attesting to his stature.</p>
        <p>''This chair,'' it read, ''reserved for Tip and his friends.''</p>
        <p>In front of James (Tip) Anderson was a glass of dark rum and a glass of beer. He sipped each occasionally as he talked about the Old Course at St. Andrews, where he caddied since he was a lad and where the 129th British Open begins today with Tiger Woods a 9-to-4 favorite in the local Ladbrokes betting parlor.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Tiger will win,'' this sage of St. Andrews said. ''It's precision here. If you go in the boonker, it's bye-bye Delilah.''</p>
        <p>If you go into some of the 167 boonkers, you have to blast out sideways, if not backward. And for all his talent, Woods will be vulnerable to the most dreaded bunkers -- the Coffins on the 13th hole, the Beardies and the Hell on the 14th, the Principal's Nose on the 16th, and the Road bunker, shaped like a mine shaft, on the 17th.</p>
        <p>''Tiger should keep the driver in the locker room,'' the sage said. ''He only needs it at 5, 14 and 17. If you drive it too far, you run out of fairway and you're in the rough.''</p>
        <p>When Woods was asked later where he will spurn his driver, he said: ''It's dependent on the wind. If the wind is blowing on the first hole dead in your face, I'm going to go driver. Other times I've hit a chip 3-iron down there and a little sand wedge to the green.'' And the first, like the 18th, doesn't have even one boonker.</p>
        <p>Tip Anderson, whose nickname was handed down from his father, Tipper, who put tips on snooker cues, subscribes to the Scottish tenet, ''If it's nae wind, it's nae golf.'' And it's seldom nae wind.</p>
        <p>''When the wind is from the east off the North Sea, the course is more difficult,'' the sage said. ''When it's from the west, it makes the course easier because then the back nine is downwind.''</p>
        <p>Woods's caddie, Steve Williams, has been here before, usually with Raymond Floyd, for both the British Open and the Dunhill Cup matches. He knows the course. But none of the touring pros' caddies know it like Tip Anderson, who has collaborated with Desmond Muirhead to write ''How to Play the Old Course'' (Mainstream, $23.50).</p>
        <p>Anderson caddied in the British Open for 36 years, notably here for Arnold Palmer in 1960, when Palmer lost to Australia's Kel Nagle by one stroke, and also when Palmer won at Royal Birkdale in 1961 and Royal Troon in 1962.</p>
        <p>''There will never be another Arnold Palmer,'' the sage said. ''He listened to me.''</p>
        <p>At the Old Course's sixth green during a 1960 practice round, Palmer had a five-foot putt. ''I told him, 'It's one ball on the right, sir,' '' the sage recalled. ''He missed and said, 'Throw it back, Tip.' He missed again. 'Throw it back, Tip.' He missed again. He said, 'You gave me the wrong line, Tip.' I said, 'It took me 28 years to find that out.' He said, 'There's no way I'll beat you, Tip,' and I said, 'You got that right.' ''</p>
        <p>When Palmer didn't enter the 1964 British Open here, he told Tony Lema to hire Tip, and Lema won.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, Tip Anderson, with a tiny Arnold Palmer umbrella pin on his white Dunvegan Hotel cap, was inducted into the Professional Caddies Association Hall of Fame at a dinner, fittingly, at Rusacks Hotel overlooking the 18th hole.</p>
        <p>''I've lived in St. Andrews all my life except I didn't remember the first two weeks,'' he said with that smile. ''I forgot to remember.''</p>
        <p>But if he doesn't think Tiger Woods will win here this week, who will be able to master the Old Course's wind and boonkers?</p>
        <p>''Nick Price,'' he said. ''He's a very consistent golfer. He hits the ball far enough and if he holes a few putts, which everyone's got to do, he'll win. That's just a matter of opinion, of course.''</p>
        <p>The Old Course is only a block away from the Dunvegan, but Tip Anderson will watch the Open on the telly there from his chair in the bar. ''I think I've seen enough golf,'' he said. ''It took me a long time to know all this and I still don't know what I'm talking about, but I can read all the putts on the telly. The third green is the fastest.''</p>
