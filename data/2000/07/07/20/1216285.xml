        <p>In a move that advances the United States ambitions of Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone company, it has offered to acquire the VoiceStream Wireless Corporation for about $53 billion in cash and stock, according to a person close to the bid.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom this week offered an exchange ratio of 3.2 shares of its stock plus $30 a share in cash, which values VoiceStream at about $205.60 a share.</p>
        <p>Other large telecommunications companies, including Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, are interested in VoiceStream because they need to make acquisitions to provide a complete array of services for clients. But Deutsche Telekom's valuation of VoiceStream is already considered high.</p>
        <p>If the bid is accepted, it would value VoiceStream at more than $20,000 per subscriber, or more than three times the average for wireless carriers. Verizon, the largest wireless carrier in the United States, is valued at about $4,000 per subscriber, while Sprint PCS, which is smaller but faster growing, is valued at about $10,000 per subscriber.</p>
        <p>''It is very expensive,'' said Frederick Moran, a telecommunications analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company. ''You have to ask how they would get a return on an investment like that.''</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom is betting on the potential for growth by pushing to acquire VoiceStream, a company that has been on an acquisition tear of its own. Last year VoiceStream bought two wireless carriers, Omnipoint and Aerial Communications, for a combined $5 billion.</p>
        <p>''Valuations are extremely difficult to quantify when a company knows it has to grow and have pockets deep enough to do so,'' said Steven Yanis, an analyst at Banc of America Securities.</p>
        <p>Shares of VoiceStream, a wireless carrier based in Bellevue, Wash., rose 93.75 cents yesterday, to $145.50. The American depository receipts of Deutsche Telekom, based in Bonn, fell 87.5 cents, to $54.875.</p>
        <p>Operating on the global system for mobile telecommunications, known as G.S.M., the same standard in use in Europe, VoiceStream has ample room to grow in the United States, with licenses to cover about three-quarters of the population, or more than 200 million people.</p>
        <p>The possible merger of VoiceStream into Deutsche Telekom gives other carriers incentive to reach similar deals. Sprint's wireless arm, which has been a target for Deutsche Telekom, is left vulnerable after its parent company's $115 billion merger with WorldCom unraveled.</p>
        <p>''There's a good side and a bad side to deals like this,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst. ''At least it means that the psychology involved makes the deal ahead more expensive.''</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom may not stop with VoiceStream. It has previously tried to buy Qwest Communications of Denver, and might do so again. Or it could be eyeing Sprint PCS, the fourth-largest wireless carrier, as some analysts have suggested.</p>
        <p>In any case, Deutsche Telekom will probably face an uphill battle in any large acquisition it attempts in the United States after opposition emerged in Congress to the acquisition of American telecommunications concerns by companies controlled by foreign governments. The German government owns more than half of Deutsche Telekom.</p>
