        <p>The planned closing of Puck Holdings's $175 million purchase of the Devils has been delayed, but the deal is still alive. The sale had been scheduled to close July 12 but will not be final for a few weeks.</p>
        <p>''In my mind there is no doubt,'' said Harvey Schiller, chairman of YankeeNets, which would run the Devils as general partner. Puck Holdings was created by Lewis Katz and Raymond Chambers, part-owners of the YankeeNets, to acquire the Devils from John McMullen. ''Ray and Lewis have seen no problem, Schiller said.''</p>
        <p>Buying the Stanley Cup champion Devils is crucial to the YankeeNets' plan for an arena in Newark and a regional cable sports network to carry the Yankees, Nets and Devils.</p>
        <p>The delay in closing the Devils' purchase is being caused by the time needed for Katz and Chambers to assemble as many as six or eight additional investors.</p>
        <p>Schiller said he hoped the investment lineup would be completed by the end of July and the sale of the Devils made final then or soon after.</p>
