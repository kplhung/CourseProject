        <p>ASKING whether you need wireless Internet service for your handheld computer is like asking about the sound of one hand clapping. Just trying it out and seeing whether you like it is more practical. But then, when it comes to shiny new gadgets, I've always followed the path of  buy first, ask questions later.</p>
        <p>After testing wireless modems and Internet services for Palm organizers from both OmniSky and GoAmerica.net, I can see what all the fuss is about.

I've used the wireless Web connection for only a couple months, but I am seriously hooked. I may not need it, but I like it.</p>

        <p>ASKING whether you need wireless Internet service for your handheld computer is like asking about the sound of one hand clapping. Just trying it out and seeing whether you like it is more practical. But then, when it comes to shiny new gadgets, I've always followed the path of  buy first, ask questions later.</p>
        <p>After testing wireless modems and Internet services for Palm organizers from both OmniSky and GoAmerica.net, I can see what all the fuss is about. (Those opting for Microsoft's PocketPC platform aren't out of the wireless loop either: cell-phone connectors and the recently announced wireless service packages from GoAmerica and Aether Systems provide similar freewheeling possibilities.) I've used the wireless Web connection for only a couple months, but I am seriously hooked. I may not need it, but I like it.</p>
        <p>Although I live in New York, a major coverage area, I don't work in sales, and I haven't yet had to buy plane tickets when I was in a cab on the way to the airport, firing off e-mail messages as I went. But when I was out and about on a recent Friday night with the OmniSky modem in tow, I was able to check on the flight of a friend flying in, keep tabs on the score of the New York Liberty game, reply to e-mail that had just arrived and check bids on Ebay auctions. It may seem rather frivolous, but the fact that I didn't have to go home to my computer but could work these tasks into the dead spots of my evening saved me time that I could use later for other nefarious purposes, like reading a book or watching ''Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Wrong Trousers'' on DVD.</p>
        <p>The wireless service also saved my sanity and let me keep in touch with my editors when I was cooling my heels in June in the Manhattan Criminal Court building's jury assembly room, doing my civic duty. Incorporating the OmniSky product into my daily routine was similar to working my first Pilot 5000 into my daily life back in 1996. Once I remembered that I had the darned thing, it became, for better or worse, an appendage.</p>
        <p>Adding an external modem to the Palm is not the only option for wireless connectivity. Web-enabled cell phones have been around for months, and Palm Inc. recently announced plans for a software product called the Palm Mobile Internet Kit. It is supposed to let Palm users worldwide (with III's or later versions) connect wirelessly to the Internet using mobile phones or Palm-compatible modems. The company says the kit should be available later this year for less than $50.</p>
        <p>There is also, of course, the company's Palm VII, which offers built-in wireless access and streamlined Web content from its own service plan; users of the Palm mobile kits can enjoy the same service. For those who already own a Palm organizer or who don't want to buy a Palm VII, there are a couple of other enticing options.</p>
        <p>OmniSky began offering its wireless modem and Internet service package to Palm V and Vx owners in May, and its customized modem module for Handspring Visor devotees is due this fall. GoAmerica recently revamped its service and offers its own modem and access package for many types of Palm organizers, including the Palm Professional, the Palm III series and the Palm V series.</p>
        <p>Taking into account the monthly cost and the coverage and content offered, OmniSky comes out ahead in my book. OmniSky's Minstrel V modem (made by Novatell) clips neatly to the back of the slim Palm V organizer. Even though the modem doubles the thickness of the Palm, the service more than makes up for the added weight of the modem and antenna with a wealth of wireless features. Users can check their e-mail on as many as six accounts. They can also browse more than 1,000 Web sites streamlined for wireless surfing, and they can explore other sites around the Net as well.</p>
        <p>OmniSky, which mainly uses AT&amp;T's wireless network, is not available nationwide. It is concentrated around major metropolitan areas, particularly on the East and West Coasts.</p>
        <p>The company suggests that you have 1.4 megabytes of RAM free on your palmtop before using the OmniSky package, and the Palm V comes with a total of 2 megabytes. Two megabytes is probably enough for most people, who probably use only the organizer's standard functions, even with the OmniSky programs installed. I am one of those users, though, who insist on toting around a ton of space-eating Palm shareware programs, along with electronic copies of documents like the New York City subway map and the Tao Te Ching. (I like to think of those two as somehow complementing each other in the realm of daily urban life.)</p>
        <p>To satisfy my shareware cravings and need for space, I have been using a Palm Vx, with its beefy 8 megabytes of RAM. After I installed OmniSky, I also got a Palm Telnet program from the PalmGear H.Q. Web site (www.palmgear.com) so I could log in and read postings from my favorite online community, New York's technologically old-fashioned but always entertaining Echo bulletin board.</p>
        <p>When you sign up for the OmniSky service, the company ships you the modem and a CD-ROM with all the software you'll need to set everything up, including the modem driver for the Palm. While you run the installer program, you'll be asked to configure your POP3 e-mail accounts, including the omnisky.net address that is made available for you.</p>
        <p>The installer program on the CD also provides the Palm with a huge amount of useful links in stripped-down ''Web clipping'' form, with the links organized under category headings. These groupings include Finance (E*Trade, Fidelity and others), Travel (Travelocity, BizTravel, MapBlast and more), News and Sports ( ABCNews, Yahoo, MSNBC and others), Shopping, Living and Local Events. Once installed, the software works with your Palm's address book -- it will pop your e-mail address right into place when you are composing a message.</p>
        <p>GoAmerica's latest product and plan for Palm devices, while not as versatile as OmniSky's, has many of the same basic features and links, and it offers owners of older Palm models the same addictive wireless options. The addition of the modem to a Palm III makes it a little unwieldy, but navigating the service itself is easy. And the on-screen graphics displaying the modem's connection progress are more informative than OmniSky's are.</p>
        <p>After you install the software and tap the GoAmerica icon on the Palm screen, a new screen will pop up with two self-explanatory icons: Go.Web and Go.Mail. You can also configure existing POP3 mail accounts for the Go.America service.</p>
        <p>The modem usually costs $299, but the company is offering $100 off the price if the user will sign a one-year contract. The service costs $49.95 a month for unlimited use or $9.95 a month for the first 25 kilobytes of data. Details can be found at www.goamerica.net.</p>
        <p>A GoAmerica module for the Handspring Visor is under development, and the company also offers a variety of wireless options for pagers, smart phones and laptops.</p>
        <p>The OmniSky modem usually costs $299 as well, but the company is holding a half-price sale on the device through the end of August for people who sign six-month contracts for the monthly service. Unlimited usage is $39.95 per month. OmniSky's unlimited use plan is cheaper than the unlimited plan offered by Palm  for the Palm VII, which costs $44.99. More information is available at www.omnisky.com.</p>
        <p>The OmniSky installer software is designed for use with Windows 95, 98, 2000 and NT, but I was also able to coax the files onto the Palm with a Macintosh G3 running Virtual PC 3.0. GoAmerica's installer CD is also for Windows only.</p>
        <p>One quibble I have with the clip-on modems from OmniSky and GoAmerica is that there's no pass-through port incorporated into the modem design. That means you can't attach an external keyboard or other additional hardware device at the same time because the modem is camped out in the HotSync port. For users who need to enter a lot of text while maintaining the wireless connection, the Palm VII has the edge here.</p>
        <p>The price of the modem and the monthly service plan from either company is a bit of an investment, but if you need constant access to your e-mail or a constant flow of data into your hand, wireless service is well worth a look, especially if you already own a Palm device. I found it worth the price for the convenience and flexibility it offers.</p>
        <p>Yes, I know it's a guilty pleasure, but I think my Internal Rationalization Module will keep those feelings at bay until the early adopter's Next Big Thing becomes everyone else's Thing to Have.</p>
