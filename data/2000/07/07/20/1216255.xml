        <p>Howell Raines Editorial Notebook tribute to Sen Paul Coverdell on his death at age 61; holds he was part of demographic change that transformed Georgia politics in last third of 20th century, big surge of out-of-state Republicans who moved to Atlanta suburbs (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia was a mild-mannered Republican seasoned in political obscurity. As minority leader of the Georgia State Senate in the 1970's, he was part of a legislative bloc so small and impotent that it was ignored, steamrolled and sometimes openly ridiculed by the Democrats who controlled the legislature as if by birthright. None of us covering the Georgia Capitol in those days would have picked Mr. Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, as a future United States senator. Now, in retrospect, we can see him as part of the second of two transforming waves that swept Georgia politics in the last third of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>The first wave of change was driven by law. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 brought hundreds of black Democrats into office. The second wave of change was demographic, as exemplified by fast-growing Atlanta. Georgia's progressive Democrats had long dreamed of the day when Atlanta would be big enough to outvote the state's rural conservatives. What they had not foreseen was that thousands of the newcomers flooding into the Atlanta suburbs would be out-of-state Republicans who rejected both the Democratic power structure and the Goldwater Republicans then in control of the Southern G.O.P.</p>

        <p>Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia was a mild-mannered Republican seasoned in political obscurity. As minority leader of the Georgia State Senate in the 1970's, he was part of a legislative bloc so small and impotent that it was ignored, steamrolled and sometimes openly ridiculed by the Democrats who controlled the legislature as if by birthright. None of us covering the Georgia Capitol in those days would have picked Mr. Coverdell, who died Tuesday at age 61, as a future United States senator. Now, in retrospect, we can see him as part of the second of two transforming waves that swept Georgia politics in the last third of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>The first wave of change was driven by law. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 brought hundreds of black Democrats into office. The second wave of change was demographic, as exemplified by fast-growing Atlanta. Georgia's progressive Democrats had long dreamed of the day when Atlanta would be big enough to outvote the state's rural conservatives. What they had not foreseen was that thousands of the newcomers flooding into the Atlanta suburbs would be out-of-state Republicans who rejected both the Democratic power structure and the Goldwater Republicans then in control of the Southern G.O.P.</p>
        <p>They created a ready-made constituency for Mr. Coverdell, a classic mainstream Republican who was fiscally conservative yet moderate on social issues. ''That was what made the Republican Party attractive to these people who came in,'' said Bill Shipp, a veteran political commentator from Atlanta. ''Until Coverdell and Johnny Isakson [another Atlanta moderate] came along, Georgia Republicans were disgruntled segregationist Democrats.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the sprinkling of ultraconservative Republicans elected during the Goldwater boom, Mr. Coverdell was not hostile to black aspirations. Indeed, by the time he left the Georgia Senate in 1989, he had gained enough influence to make his mark as a reliable legislative advocate for Atlanta's black mayors. He was known as a policy wonk and a nice guy, traits that would mark his service as director of the Peace Corps under President George Bush. He worked hard in that position to promote a program that is unpopular with many Republicans because of its identification with President John F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>A similar earnestness would mark Mr. Coverdell's career in the United States Senate, but he did not get there by wearing a halo or emphasizing his credentials as a moderate. He won his seat from Wyche Fowler, a Democrat popular with liberals, by running to the right, especially on the abortion issue.</p>
        <p>It is, of course, always tricky to define political moderation among Southern Republicans. By any measure, Mr. Coverdell, a big booster of tax cuts and school vouchers, was plenty conservative. Lately he had grown close to Trent Lott, the Senate's tough-guy majority leader. But his primary alliances were with less hard-edged types like President Bush and his son George W. Bush, the Texas governor. He helped plan the coming Republican Convention. In the event of a Republican victory, according to Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, a Democrat, Mr. Coverdell ''would have played a big role in a Bush administration, in the cabinet or as a special adviser.'' But in a region that still tends to celebrate pols who are loud and flashy, Mr. Coverdell will be remembered for his general decency, his serious interest in good government and his unlikely leap from the back benches of the Georgia Capitol.</p>
