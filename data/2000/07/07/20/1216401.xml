        <p>SARLIN-Louis. Died on July 19, 2000 at 88 years of age. A native New Yorker and graduate of Stuyvesant High School, Cooper Union, The Bank Street College of Education and recipient of a Doctorate in Education from New York University, he was a gifted and influential teacher. As a young artist, he worked with the Federal Arts Project at the New York World's Fair. A beloved teacher at the Little Red School House in Manhattan, he specialized in eliciting creative writing from young people, and inspired the careers of many writers, a number of whom have dedicated books to him. As a respected professor of education at Baruch College of the City University of New York, he influenced a generation of teachers. He was married for 49 years to the late Lilian Bass Sarlin, and spent 13 years with his companion, the late Frances Hill. He will be deeply missed by his sons and daughtersin-law, David and Istar Schwager Sarlin, Bob and Peggy Sarlin, and Don and Ruth Sarlin. Perhaps his greatest legacies of all are his bright and compassionate grandchildren; Kay, Alex, Asher, Benjamin, Jesse and Jonathan Sarlin. Services at 11:30AM on Sunday, July 23rd at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76 St and Amsterdam Ave.</p>
