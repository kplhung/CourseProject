        <p>Ever since his post-punk band released its first compact disc in May, Ken Peterson, a guitar player and commercial dishwasher salesman, has been spending a lot of time on the Internet. The band, mi6, has never played outside the Kansas City area, and its self-financed CD is available only in local stores.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Peterson, determined to attract a wider audience, also released several of the new tracks on Web sites devoted to music. He has e-mailed anyone who has ever expressed an interest in mi6 and persuaded several online radio stations to play its music. So far, about two dozen people who otherwise would never have heard of mi6 have bought the CD -- not bad, Mr. Peterson considers, ''for a no-name band'' from Lawrence, Kan.</p>
        <p>But what really has him logging on lately is the rankings on garageband.com, where one of mi6's songs has claimed the top spot based on the reviews of visitors to the site. If it remains No. 1 through mid-August, the band stands to win  a $250,000 record contract.</p>
        <p>''The Internet has been very cool for us,'' said Mr. Peterson, adding that he has also been contacted by an executive at a major record label who came across mi6 on another Web site. ''The thing about our band is we just want to play. But a record contract -- yeah, that would be awesome.''</p>
        <p>As the recording industry and commercial artists like the heavy metal band Metallica try to stamp out the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted music in the form of computer files known as MP3's, tens of thousands of aspiring rock stars are happily using the technology to give their music away -- and more than a few are beginning to see some payoff.</p>
        <p>Most, of course, are not getting record deals from the major labels. But for some bands, that might no longer be the ultimate goal. The Internet's emerging role as an equal-opportunity jukebox is providing new ways to make a modest income from a relatively small base of fans.</p>
        <p>Unlike most of the MP3's available through popular services like Napster, it is unquestionably legal to download, play and copy with abandon those posted by unsigned artists on the growing cluster of Web sites intended for them.</p>
        <p>Somewhat to the surprise of the artists themselves -- and even to the proprietors of these sites -- millions of Internet users are doing just that.</p>
        <p>''On a lot of days the downloads of unsigned artists are right up there with the name acts in the music videos on our site,'' said Andy Schuon, president of Farmclub.com, a site owned by Universal Music Group. ''And they're not necessarily even looking at the ones we feature. People like to dig into the jukebox and type in 'G' and just see what's there.''</p>
        <p>MP3.com, the largest repository of free music on the Web, said it receives more than half a million visitors who listen to over a million items each day. The company is perhaps best known for its legal dispute with the record industry over adding thousands of copyrighted songs to its database, a case that it is in the process of settling. But its revenues are generated from advertising sales based on visitors who come almost exclusively to hear unsigned artists.</p>
        <p>Last November it began to pay all artists, signed or not, a small fee each time someone listens to one of their songs. And particularly since May, when the company expanded its monthly Payback for Playback pool to $1 million, it has become a source of significant revenue for those at the top of the MP3.com heap, and an incentive for the 75,000 or so others to promote their music.</p>
        <p>''It's been quite a victory for us after having a lot of record companies close doors on us for years,'' said Chris Geith, a jazz keyboardist in Madison, Conn., whose Chris Geith Group last month made more than $6,500 from MP3.com.</p>
        <p>Several of those consistently ranking in MP3.com's top 10 said they have little interest in a record deal. That may be just as well, since it is hard to imagine a major label promoting them.</p>
        <p>They include Ernesto Cortazar, a 60-year-old Mexican composer for films who has mainly performed in piano bars and who has earned more than $100,000 from his online efforts since last fall, about $80,000 from nearly 4 million downloads of his songs and the remainder from CD sales; Mikel Fair, a 26-year-old engineer who quit his job at Compaq Computer and built a home recording studio when he began making more than $20,000 a month from downloads of his electronic music; and Alex Smith, who just graduated from high school in Stillwater, Minn., and last month earned $10,239.08 from MP3.com.</p>
        <p>MP3.com, which says its program has safeguards against ballot-stuffing, has yet to turn a profit, and Michael Robertson, the company's chief executive, has made no assurances about continuing the payment program. But other sites, such as the Internet Underground Music Archive (www.iuma.com) and audiohighway.com, also have compensation schemes for unsigned artists.</p>
        <p>In any case, few of the 100,000 or so unsigned artists on the Internet participate in such revenue-sharing. Most say the main benefit of distributing their songs is the ability to attract an audience that may eventually buy CD's or T-shirts or come to a live performance.</p>
        <p>And the more experienced caution that none of that will happen without logging plenty of hours marketing themselves, online and off.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I did was ask my father to reply to all his e-mail,'' said Ernesto Cortazar Jr., who has taken a full-time job promoting his father's music on MP3.com. ''I am always motivating him. The first time he appeared on the charts I printed that paper, I showed it to him, I framed it. I was like, 'You're going up!' ''</p>
        <p>After persuading his father to put his music on the Internet last year, the younger Mr. Cortazar spent weeks scouring the MP3.com message boards and picking up tips from other artists. Mr. Cortazar Sr. sends out regular e-mail updates to a growing database of fans, asking in each one that if they enjoyed his piano playing that they recommend it to a friend. Since about half of Mr. Cortazar's CD sales come from outside the United States, his son recruited fans to translate his Web pages into Korean, Spanish, French, Slovenian, Romanian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Greek, Italian and Hebrew.</p>
        <p>The result has enabled Mr. Cortazar Sr. to quit his job playing in a restaurant in Sherman Oaks, Calif. and move into a larger home.</p>
        <p>Glenn Rubenstein of the Northern California band Headboard credits the Internet with vastly expanding the band's reach. Starting with an e-mail list of about 10,000 fans who had attended shows over the last three years, Mr. Rubenstein doubled the list over the last year despite taking a break from touring. Mr. Rubenstein stayed busy e-mailing fans of other bands like his own and offering T-shirts to those who drove the most traffic to his Web site.</p>
        <p>His efforts won the band a spot on Farmclub.com's television show on the USA Network a few months ago. But more important, Mr. Rubenstein said, after sending out an e-mail message informing fans of a new CD, he received 200 checks for $12 in the mail last week.</p>
        <p>''The postmaster said there was too much mail to fit in the box!'' crowed Mr. Rubenstein, who is also an editor at an Internet news site.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is so enamored of the Internet as a means of distributing or discovering new music. Traditional record executives mostly see the Internet as another repository for the demo discs that pile up unopened in their offices. And even bands that use all the right Internet marketing tricks can fail to find a way to get to the next level.</p>
        <p>Red Delicious, a Pasadena, Calif., band, spent several months at the top of MP3.com's charts last year. But several nibbles from record labels fell through.</p>
        <p>''At least in the record industry you have a chance to make money,'' said Rob King, the keyboardist for Red Delicious, estimating that Internet revenues bring in only about $1,200 a month for the band. ''We got tons of press. We were the Internet band, everyone knew who we were, but none of it helped us get a deal.''</p>
        <p>Internet companies are also beginning to forge new relationships with labels and artists. Emboldened by the idea of being able to obtain demographic information and e-mail addresses of thousands of potential customers who have become fans of an artist online, companies like Farmclub.com and garageband.com have already signed several bands to emerge from the Internet.</p>
        <p>''The major record labels are interested in artists that are going to come out of the chute and sell millions of records,'' said Tom Zito, chief executive of garageband.com. ''That is not really music that people deep in their gut embrace. Our process really allows people to find music that is more interesting to music lovers than the kind of stuff that people who work at record companies think they're going to like.''</p>
        <p>Just as the global network has seemed to tap into a near-universal desire to be a rock star, it appears to have unleashed the latent record executive in many a music listener.</p>
        <p>''It seems like with the radio once they get a hit song they play it over and over until you get tired of it,'' said Lisa Fields, 42, a manager for an apartment complex in Fitzgerald, Ga., who cites the unsigned Buzz Poets as her favorite new band. ''Going on the Internet you can constantly get new music, new sounds, new groups so you've got something new to listen to all the time.''</p>
        <p>Shane J. Strait, an accountant in Harrisburg, Pa., explains his hours on MP3.com and other Internet music sites another way: ''It's always better to find bands when they're just forming,'' he said. ''That's when they care more about their fans.''</p>
