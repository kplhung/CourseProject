        <p>O. J. Simpson will appear on a series of television programs next week, including ''Today'' on NBC and ''The View'' on ABC, to publicize a Web site on which he will take questions from the public.</p>
        <p>The interviews will be rare television appearances for Mr. Simpson, who, in the years since his acquittal on murder charges in 1994, has been extensively interviewed only on Black Entertainment Television in 1996 and on ESPN in 1998.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday Mr. Simpson will be interviewed on ''Today'' by the anchor Matt Lauer. On Wednesday he will appear on the ABC daytime show ''The View,'' talking mainly with Barbara Walters and Star  Jones.</p>
        <p>Later on Wednesday he will be seen in an afternoon segment on the Fox News Channel, and that night he will appear on the same channel on the program ''The Edge'' with Paula Zahn.</p>
        <p>In all the appearances, Mr. Simpson will discuss the start-up of the Web site AskOJ.com, established by the Entertainment Network, a company that operates adult-oriented Web sites. Internet users, who will be able to direct questions to him, will be charged a $9.95 fee to register for the site, said Brian Barry, a spokesman for the company and Mr. Simpson. They will also be able to purchase what Mr. Barry called ''O. J. memorabilia.''</p>
        <p>''O. J. will be donating all his potential earnings from the Web site to charity,'' Mr. Barry said, but he did not provide details of the financial arrangement.</p>
        <p>Jeff Zucker, the executive producer of ''Today,'' said Mr. Simpson was doing the interviews to ''publicize the start of this Web site.'' But both Mr. Zucker and Bill Geddie, the executive producer of ''The View,'' said no conditions had been placed on the interviews. Mr. Zucker said Mr. Lauer would ''ask the questions you'd expect him to be asked.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zucker gave some examples: ''How is he supporting himself? How are people treating him? How is he dealing with the financial judgment against him?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson lost a civil lawsuit over the deaths of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1997. He was ordered to pay Ms. Simpson's and Mr. Goldman's families financial judgments totaling $33.5 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Geddie emphasized that ''The View'' is ''an opinion program'' and said, ''The image of O. J. sitting in the center of our panel of women was too powerful to resist.'' He added, ''I think he knows he's going to be sitting with people who believe he's a murderer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zucker said he expected some viewers to be unhappy that ''Today'' was giving Mr. Simpson a forum to discuss his Web site, but said, ''It's certainly a newsworthy interview.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Geddie said Mr. Simpson had originally contacted Ms. Walters about doing an interview for her ABC News program, ''20/20,'' but said,  ''Barbara did not want to interview him on that show.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Geddie added that the scheduled NBC appearance influenced his decision to book the interview. ''Having him on the 'Today' show helped me,'' he said. ''I don't know if we would have gone out on a limb to be the first to put him on. Being on 'Today' gives it some legitimacy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barry said the Entertainment Network was based in Tampa, Fla. He described it as a ''company that creates voyeuristic Web sites.''</p>
