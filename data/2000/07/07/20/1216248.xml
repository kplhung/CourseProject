        <p>SINCE it first appeared in stores just four years ago with its lineup of unusual flavors and a distinctive double-lizard logo, SoBe has grown into a Godzilla of the noncarbonated drinks business.</p>
        <p>This year, the company expects to post $250 million in sales, up from $167 million last year and $67 million in 1998.</p>
        <p>Its products, which it prefers to call ''healthy refreshment,'' have names like Zen Blend, Tsunami and Strawberry Carrot Elixir, and feature ingredients like bee pollen, ginkgo and something called kava kava. It has established a customer base that ranges from middle-age women to radicalized teenagers, and its official alliances run the gamut from Wal-Mart to Biker Sherlock, a demigod of the extreme-sports racing circuit. Its marketing has been mostly grass roots, partly by handing out samples from old buses and milk trucks, and advertising has been mostly on radio.</p>
        <p>Now, however, with giants like Coca-Cola taking an interest in drinks beyond their traditional brands, pressure is growing to develop a more sophisticated advertising campaign and, to go with it, a more aggressive business plan. Many analysts say SoBe has to push itself to the next level, to become less a phenomenon and more a permanent player in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry.</p>
        <p>The company, founded by John Bello and Tom Schwalm in 1996 and named for South Beach, the trendy Miami neighborhood, has plans to put at least $12 million into advertising and sports sponsorship this year and will introduce several products in the coming months.</p>
        <p>It has also announced plans to sell a two-thirds stake to the Boston-based investment firm of J. W. Childs Associates, a development that many think will lead to an initial public offering of the company before long. SoBe's rival, Snapple Beverages, is planning to go public later this year in an offering estimated at $115 million.</p>
        <p>''SoBe right now is at a critical point,'' said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''It is on its way to becoming a very successful brand.''  Mr. Bello said his company had succeeded ''because we have a product that consumers want,'' and added that he planned to expand distribution in the coming year with a variety of products and packaging.</p>
        <p>Among those is a sports drink like Gatorade, fortified with additives and packaged in a reusable plastic sports bottle. There are also plans to introduce a chocolate drink, named ''Love Bus Brew,'' and a high-energy blend called Adrenaline. Child-friendly packages, containing a vitamin-fortified juice drink tentatively named Lizardade, are on the drawing board.</p>
        <p>The drinks are sold at mass merchandisers like Costco and Wal-Mart and this week were officially introduced in Britain.</p>
        <p>''We're everywhere, but we are not everywhere we need to be,'' Mr. Bello said. ''We have had some difficulty penetrating the major cities like New York, Philadelphia and Washington, where there are not a lot of distribution options.''</p>
        <p>SoBe's competitors, which include Snapple, Nantucket Nectars and Mistic, tend to be handled by the same distribution network, he added. ''Where do they put their focus?'' he said. ''That's the game we are playing at this point.''</p>
        <p>Many industry experts praise SoBe's development so far, saying it has carved out a particular place in the crowded beverage aisle. ''The marketing, the use of the lizard and the innovation have all been first rate,'' Mr. Sicher said. ''I really think the U.S. consumer is fascinated by a beverage that claims to do more than taste good and refresh.''</p>
        <p>SoBe has so far avoided television ads because Mr. Bello thinks they would be too defining for the brand. An ad aimed at teenagers could alienate other SoBe loyalists, or so the thinking goes. Too much emphasis on the ingredients might create another set of problems.</p>
        <p>''We've gone mainstream with a product that has all these nutrients and herbal additives and tastes great and has mystique,'' Mr. Bello said. ''The last thing we want to be is a medicine, or a castor oil, or something that doesn't taste good.''</p>
        <p>Besides, he added, television ads may not be as effective for SoBe as the fleet of buses, trucks and armored cars bearing the lizard logo.. ''You have to spend so much to cut through the clutter,'' he said. ''Our sampling really works to create a buzz around the product in local communities. We are trying to maintain the common touch.''</p>
        <p>The trick going forward, particularly with a new majority shareholder, will be to maintain all that. ''What John has done with the positioning, with his grass-roots marketing, has been to build a very dedicated following,'' said Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting company that tracks beverage sales. ''He has to not lose that as he gets more broad based.''</p>
        <p>The success of SoBe has not gone unnoticed by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the giants of the soft-drink business, which have declared their intentions to become involved in all kinds of beverages. ''Coke is going to be looking at that category very strongly,'' said Andrew Conway, a beverage stocks analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''They will look at developing brands on their own and at equity investment or ownership of existing brands.''</p>
