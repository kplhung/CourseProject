        <p>Editions Norma, a small French publishing house specializing in decorative arts, has brought out another beautiful book about a nearly forgotten interior designer or architect. The 320-page ''Maxime Old: Architecte-Decorateur'' is the coffee table book of the moment for design-conscious Parisians. Old was most prolific in the 1940's and 50's, best known for work like the 1938 dining room (with expandable table) above. He was a contemporary of Andre Arbus, Jacques Adnet and Jean Royere. A show and sale of 30 pieces of his furniture (from private collections, including his family's holdings) at the Yves Gastou Gallery on the Rue Bonaparte sold out in a flash. In New York, the book, in French only, is $150 at Archivia, 944 Madison Avenue (74th Street).</p>
