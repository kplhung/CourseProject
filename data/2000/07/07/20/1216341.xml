        <p>A painting by Egon Schiele that was taken from its owner by the Nazis during World War II cannot be seized by the federal government as stolen property, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled this week.</p>
        <p>This is the second time the painting, ''Portrait of Wally,'' has been released by the courts. The New York State courts rejected an attempt to hold it and another Schiele painting, ''Dead City,'' as stolen goods in 1998.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan district attorney's office subpoenaed the two paintings  when they were on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in early 1998.  ''Dead City'' was released, but prosecutors have been battling the owner of the paintings, a private Austrian museum, over ''Wally'' ever since.</p>
        <p>The district attorney's subpoena was quashed by the New York State Court of Appeals in September 1999. In a ruling that avoided questions of  ownership, the court ruled that the state's 30-year-old Arts and Cultural Affairs Law prevented seizure of artworks on loan to museums.</p>
        <p>But immediately after that ruling, the office of Mary Jo White, the United States attorney, moved to seize ''Wally'' under a federal law that forbids transporting stolen goods. Lawyers for the museum, the Leopold Museum of Vienna, argued that the paintings were not stolen.</p>
        <p>In a decision released yesterday, Judge Michael B. Mukasey of Federal District Court ruled that the paintings could not legally be considered stolen because they had been recovered by United States armed forces after the war.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, a spokesman for Ms. White said the office was reviewing the decision.</p>
