        <p>The notion of holding Israeli-Palestinian summit talks at Camp David gathered steam within the White House after the failure of President Clinton's meeting with Hafez al-Assad, the late Syrian leader, in Geneva in March.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel took office in mid-1999 believing he could pursue peace negotiating tracks with Syria and the Palestinians simultaneously. But after Geneva, both Mr. Barak and Mr. Clinton realized that the Syrian track was leading nowhere.</p>
        <p>Their focus immediately switched back to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and the looming deadline of Sept. 13, the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Oslo agreements. Mr. Arafat had said he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state by that time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's special Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross, began meeting again separately with Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat. Teams of Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in fits and starts, sometimes in Israel, sometimes in Washington. In the spring, back-channel talks in Stockholm between  senior figures -- Abu Ala, the leader of the Palestinian Assembly, and Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Israeli internal security minister -- became public.</p>
        <p>It was in these Stockholm talks that some progress was made in defining the territorial shape of a Palestinian state and what might be a possible solution to dealing with the three million Palestinian refugees who were forced to leave Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and have since been scattered around the Middle East. On Jerusalem, however, the talk in Stockholm was limited to a minimal exchange of ideas, an American official said. In early May, the Stockholm talks were suspended after violence broke out on the West Bank and in Gaza.</p>
        <p>Against this backdrop of slow-moving negotiations, Mr. Barak began to persuade the White House that a secluded summit meeting with Mr. Arafat, brokered by Mr. Clinton, was the best way to achieve the far-reaching peace agreement with the Palestinians that the Israeli leader had promised his electorate.</p>
        <p>On June 2, in Lisbon, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Barak and announced afterward that a Middle East deal was ''within view.''</p>
        <p>After two visits to Israel and the West Bank in June by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and phone conversations with Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak, Mr. Clinton decided over the July 4 weekend to take the plunge. Mr. Arafat was less enthusiastic than Mr. Barak but pledged that if Mr. Clinton called him, he would go.</p>
        <p>The president's advisers were not sure that the issues had been sufficiently prepared, but with less than six months left in his presidency and the apparent trust he had built up with the two foes, Mr. Clinton decided a summit meeting was worth the risk.</p>
        <p>Indeed, for Mr. Clinton the risk was limited. If the meeting failed, he could say that as a peacemaker he had tried his hardest. If the meeting turned out to be one more step toward an agreement, that was not such a bad outcome either. If the meeting achieved the grand goal -- a broad accord -- it would be a major achievement.</p>
        <p>In his announcement on July 5, Mr. Clinton laid out two goals for the summit talks, allowing him something of a soft landing at their end. He said the ''magnitude of the challenge'' lay in the two leaders' addressing the ''most profound questions, about beliefs, political identity, collective fate.'' The two leaders had to make historic decisions that only they could make, he said.</p>
        <p>But in the same statement, Mr. Clinton set out slightly lower expectations, saying Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat would ''start drawing the contours'' of a long-awaited peace.</p>
        <p>At the end of the nine days, Mr. Clinton, who had nudged and cajoled the two leaders, and even twice held meetings until 5 a.m., made his last appeals to the two leaders to grasp the opportunity.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 21, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about President Clinton's decision to hold a Middle East summit meeting at Camp David misstated the number of Palestinian refugees who fled Israel after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. The United Nations estimated that 725,000 Arabs fled Palestine or Israel between April and December 1948. (Israel declared independence in May 1948.) The number of refugees was not three million.</p>
