        <p>DISPEKER-Thea. The Board of Directors, Artists and Staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center note with great sadness the passing of Thea Dispeker, one of the most distinguished vocal artist managers of the twentieth century. A friend of the Chamber Music Society since its inception in 1969, she brought countless singers to the stage of Alice Tully Hall and to the attention of the Chamber Music Society's audiences. The impact of her work is immense; her legacy is immeasurable. Thea's rare gift for recognizing extraordinary talent and her tireless enthusiasm for developing young singers will be greatly missed. Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Chairman Peter Frelinghuysen, President David Shifrin, Artistic Director Norma Hurlburt, Exec. Director</p>
        <p>DISPEKER-GREIG-Thea. Mannes is deeply saddened by the loss of Thea Dispeker-Greig, colleague, beloved friend, guide, career-builder, and care giver to all she touched in her long life, imparting wisdom. She was at home wherever classical music was revered. The musical world is diminished. Mannes College of Music Joel Lester, Dean</p>
        <p>DISPEKER-Thea. New York City Opera mourns the passing of its good friend Thea Dispeker. She was an enthusiastic supporter and friend of City Opera who guided the careers of many of our young artists over the years. The music world has lost a unique and special friend. We will all miss her. Paul Kellogg General Director</p>
