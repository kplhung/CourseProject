        <p>Detroit automakers may be conducting research to figure out the personality profiles of the people who buy minivans versus those who buy sport utility vehicles, but they are ignoring all the other drivers on the road.

        <p>Re ''Was Freud a Minivan or S.U.V. Kind of Guy?'' (front page, July 17):</p>
        <p>Detroit automakers may be conducting research to figure out the personality profiles of the people who buy minivans versus those who buy sport utility vehicles, but they are ignoring all the other drivers on the road. Those who have had the blinding lights of an S.U.V. bear down on them at night or who cannot see through an S.U.V.'s rear window to the traffic ahead know what I mean.</p>
        <p>People will buy what is made desirable. The automobile designers have a responsibility to create vehicles that are not only user friendly but also other-driver friendly. Instead, they are giving in to the aggressive impulses of the few as they create vehicles that resemble ''weapons'' and ''armored cars for the battlefield,'' vehicles that terrorize the rest of us, vehicles that make the road a war zone.</p>

        <p>The writer is an associate professor of cultural and social anthropology at Stanford University.</p>
