        <p>Dean Baquet, the national editor of The New York Times, was appointed by The Los Angeles Times yesterday as managing editor and its No. 2 newsroom executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baquet, who won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 1988, is the second top editor appointed by The Los Angeles Times from outside its newsroom since March, when the Tribune Company announced its purchase of the newspaper's parent, the Times Mirror Company.</p>
        <p>A month after the Chandlers, The Times's controlling family, agreed to sell their holdings to the Tribune Company, which is based in Chicago, Tribune executives appointed John S. Carroll, the editor of The Baltimore Sun, to replace Michael Parks as editor in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The Sun was part of Times Mirror and is now owned by Tribune.</p>
        <p>For five years, The Los Angeles Times has been a site of controversial and continually revised experiments with newsroom management.  Mr. Baquet, 43, has a low-key, informal management style that matches Mr. Carroll's. Mr. Baquet will oversee all the newsroom departments.</p>
        <p>In making the appointment, Mr. Carroll said the newsroom was reverting to ''a more traditional management structure'' and jettisoning the top-heavy structure of the past four years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baquet won the Pulitzer as leader of a team of reporters for The Chicago Tribune that uncovered self-dealing and waste in the Chicago City Council. At the time, The Tribune's No. 2 editor was Jack Fuller, who is now president of the Tribune Company's newspaper division. Mr. Baquet joined The New York Times in 1990 as an investigative reporter and has been national editor for five years.</p>
        <p>''The New York Times is a hard place to leave,'' Mr. Baquet said yesterday, but added: ''I just think that The Los Angeles Times would be a fun, exciting place to be right now. It has a lot of talent. The thought of working with John Carroll and going to a paper that was good but was also about to take on new leadership was irresistible.''</p>
