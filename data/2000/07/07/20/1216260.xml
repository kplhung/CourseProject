        <p>China's central bank chief said today that the country's banks would be empowered to set their own lending and savings deposit rates within the next three years, an important step toward opening the tightly controlled Chinese financial markets.</p>
        <p>Most interest rates in this country are set by the central bank, one of many mechanisms used by the government to maintain a firm grip on its currency and keep foreign investors out of its domestic stock and bond markets. In some ways, that policy has served the country well: while Asian currencies collapsed during the financial crisis that began three years ago, China's fixed-rate currency, the yuan, remained steady and the economy chugged along largely unscathed.</p>
        <p>But China has also said it is committed to liberalizing its financial system as part of a transition to a market-based economy. A convertible currency, or one that can be freely bought and sold for other currencies, would make it easier for foreign investors to do business here and allow Chinese companies to raise money abroad. It would also increase China's influence in the global economy, where the country wants to be a major power.</p>
        <p>Dai Xianglong, the central bank governor, said there is still no timetable for making the currency fully convertible, but he said at a news conference here that loosening restrictions on interest rates, allowing them to move up and down based on market forces, would take place over the next three years.</p>
        <p>''The first step is to liberalize interest rates on foreign currency deposits and lending,'' Mr. Dai said. ''The next step will be to liberalize rates on rural credit, and then in urban areas we will start by expanding the floating band of lending rates,'' he said. Interest rates on bank deposits would be allowed to float to market value last.</p>
        <p>''This is a major step forward in improving the efficiency of the economy,'' said Dong Tao, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>But he cautioned that China must first clean up its banking system, which is riddled with bad debts, before allowing the kind of competition that floating interest rates would bring. With nonperforming loans estimated above 40 percent of some banks' portfolios, unleashing market forces too early could lead to costly bank failures and risk the kind of financial crisis that China's strict financial controls are intended to avoid.</p>
        <p>Because the central bank sets lending and deposit rates and all banks are state owned, there is little true competition between them. The interest-rate controls also allow the central bank to manage demand for the currency, which it has kept artificially pegged for years at a rate around 8.28 yuan to the dollar.</p>
        <p>The country has recently begun a partial recapitalization of its major banks through the creation of asset management companies that are supposed to take some of the bad loans off those banks' books. But the program is making slow progress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dai said the central bank would also support the restructuring of the country's banks into shareholding corporations that can later go public, something that would presumably increase their capital and force them to adopt more efficient and open management.</p>
        <p>Further steps to open the country's financial markets remain more distant, he said. For example, he said no decision had been made to allow foreign investors to buy Chinese stocks -- the class A shares traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets that are denominated in local currency.</p>
        <p>''The rationale for these constraints is that some enterprises are not sufficiently self-disciplined, the depth of the Chinese capital market is not sufficient, and we are not sufficiently capable of supervising the securities market,'' Mr. Dai said.</p>
        <p>Foreigners are now restricted to a small number of shares denominated in Hong Kong or United States dollars that are not available to domestic investors. The segregated market keeps foreigners from acquiring control of China's listed companies.</p>
        <p>And it insulates the stock markets from the sudden outflow of capital that has set off crises in other developing economies.</p>
        <p>''I would be happy if I could convert the yuan into U.S. dollars when I go to New York to attend meetings,'' Mr. Dai said, ''but now I think there is a long way to go.''</p>
