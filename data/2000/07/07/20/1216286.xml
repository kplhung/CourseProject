        <p>Allegations that an Orthodox rabbi in Paramus abused teenagers in his charge during a 30-year period continue to ripple through New Jersey Orthodox Jewish communities, with many people increasingly angry over allegations that his supervisors may have tried to cover up his abuses.</p>
        <p>Two congregations, Beth Aaron in Teaneck and Ohay Emeth in Highland Park, suspended their membership in the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, known as the Orthodox Union, to send officials a message that they should not just sweep the matter of Rabbi Baruch Lanner under the table, congregation officials said. And Tuesday night, about 100 youth leaders, parents and rabbis met at Congregation Israel here to discuss what changes in policies they want Orthodox Union leaders to adopt to prevent future abuses.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is very concerned about the allegations and what might have happened, and why these things, if true, were not caught or stopped,'' said Albert Hocchauser, president of Congregation Ohay Emeth in Highland Park.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Lanner, 50, was a ranking leader of the Orthodox Union for more than a decade. The union is the most prominent national organization in the Orthodox branch of Judaism. Among its many programs, it operates the National Conference of Synagogue Youth, which provides educational and recreational programs to 40,000 youths worldwide. About 5,000 of them are in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Last month, on the day that an article outlining the charges of abuse against Rabbi Lanner were published in The Jewish Week, the largest Jewish newspaper in the country, the union announced that the rabbi was resigning as director of regions of the youth organization.</p>
        <p>The union, based in New York City,  has formed an committee to investigate the charges, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Jewish Week quoted 10 people, most in their 30's and 40's, who said that as teenagers, they had experienced either violence or sexually aggressive behavior by the rabbi. Their accounts have been repeated in several other news articles. The allegations have reverberated in Jewish communities all over the country, but especially in New Jersey, where Rabbi Lanner came in contact with thousands of children in the decades he was in charge of youth programs.</p>
        <p>Charlene Rosenberg, the wife of an Orthodox rabbi in Edison, said that for years many in the community  had heard rumors about Rabbi Lanner. When The Jewish Week published accounts of people who said they had been victimized by the rabbi, it convinced many who already had been skeptical about him, she said. But what has angered people most, she said, is that some of those in the article said that they had reported the behavior to Rabbi Lanner's superiors, and that nothing had been done. In fact, the Orthodox Union promoted him over the years.</p>
        <p>''Now we know that they knew,'' Mrs. Rosenberg said of union leaders. ''They knew about it, and they hid it.''</p>
        <p>Today, on its Web site, The Jewish Week offered a first-person account by a young woman who said Rabbi Lanner regularly called her into his office, when she was a student and he was the principal of Hillel, a coeducational yeshiva in Deal, and became increasingly physical with her. (He left as principal about three years ago.) She said he touched her on her breasts and genitals throughout the school year, and he also called her home to tell her he loved her. Last week, she filed a formal complaint against Rabbi Lanner with the Monmouth County prosecutor's office, which is investigating.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Lanner has admitted in previous interviews that he made ''errors in judgment,'' but has maintained that he did nothing illegal. Today, in a telephone interview, he said that the latest account in The Jewish Week was not true.</p>
        <p>''It's ludicrous, he said. ''Emphatically, emphatically, emphatically it did not happen. This is a kid that came from a troubled background. I took her in and raised the tuition money for her to attend that school, and bus money, and this is the payback I receive?''</p>
        <p>At Tuesday night's meeting, those in attendance agreed to send the Orthodox Union a statement asking that parents be involved in setting any new policies for proper behavior from youth leaders.</p>
        <p>''What this person proved is that it can happen here,'' said Murray Sragow, the youth chairman at Rinat Israel Congregation in Teaneck and one of the organizers of the meeting. ''It tells us there should have been policies in place all along that would have prevented this. Now our eyes have been opened.''</p>
        <p>Some of those at the meeting also expressed skepticism about an investigation that the organization was conducting into itself. The union has hired a law firm and named a nine-member commission, three of whose members are on its own board, to investigate the Lanner matter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mandell Ganchrow, a retired surgeon who is president of the Orthodox Union, said that people would have to trust that the organization would not shy from the truth.</p>
        <p>''You can always have criticism,'' he said. ''We're doing it this way at significant expense to make sure the report sees the light of day and that our board acts on it and restores the dignity and credibility of the union.''</p>
