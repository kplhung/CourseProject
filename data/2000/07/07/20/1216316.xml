        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>GETTING PERSONAL WITH BUSH -- For voters who were not feeling up close and personal enough with the candidacy of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the campaign unveiled a redesigned Web site, www.GeorgeWBush.com, with a new feature, ''My George W'' yesterday. It lets users receive e-mail messages from the campaign about issues of specific interest to them. The revised site, which includes sections like ''GWB TV,'' which is devoted to video clips of Mr. Bush, is being promoted in a novel way, too. The campaign says it is running the first political TV commercial intended solely to advertise a candidate's Web site. The unnarrated, 30-second spot scans the campaign's home page and supplies the address of the Web site, where users can also answer a daily trivia question and win Bush campaign souvenirs.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>ANTI-ABORTION PLANK -- Supporters of abortion rights said yesterday that they had told Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Republican platform committee, that they had not ruled out a floor fight to change the platform's strong anti-abortion stance. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed nominee, has said he favors keeping that language. But Susan Cullman, co-chairwoman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, said she and her colleagues told Mr. Thompson that their struggle would not end with the platform committee vote. Ms. Cullman said her group was reviewing its options -- one of which is to try to assemble a majority of six state delegations, necessary to make a motion to try to bring the issue to the floor.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT SEAT -- None of the three candidates in Tuesday's Democratic primary in Georgia's Seventh Congressional District took more than 50 percent of the vote, so a runoff will be held on Aug. 8 to decide which of the top two finishers, Roger Kahn or Jim Williams, gets to challenge the incumbent Republican, Representative Bob Barr, in the fall. The district, stretching northwest from Atlanta, has been reliably conservative Republican but Democrats think they have a shot at picking it up because Mr. Barr drew only 55 percent of the vote two years ago when he defeated Mr. Williams to win a third term, and because they believe he has been weakened by his ties to the gun lobby and his scorn for President Clinton. Mr. Kahn, a wealthy liquor distributor, has the backing of a number of Democratic leaders and is favored to win the runoff with Mr. Williams, an insurance broker.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>GORE AVOIDING GALA -- Al Gore may be the most invited guest to parties during the Democratic National Convention, but there is at least one he will not attend: a gala at the Playboy Mansion. ''We're not attending, participating, supporting, condoning or giving our imprimatur in any shape, way or form,'' Chris Lehane, spokesman for the Gore campaign, said Tuesday. The party is billed as a fund-raiser for the Hispanic Unity Caucus, which promotes voter registration among Latinos and is led by Representative Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat and a close Gore ally. But the party at Hugh Hefner's playhouse, scheduled to coincide with the convention, has become a target of the Republicans, who have asserted that Representative Sanchez is out of touch with both her party and voters if she believes ''scantily dressed women and alcohol'' can help improve Latino participation in the electoral process. Representative Sanchez contends the party's ''high-profile venue'' will make it a sell-out event.</p>

        <p>UNEXPECTED GUESTS IN PHILADELPHIA -- Seeking to improve relations with the Republican Party and learn how to build a political party, emissaries from Russian's new president, Vladimir Putin, plan to attend the Republican Party's nominating convention in Philadelphia later this month. Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, who is arranging the trip, says the group is following his advice to not ''put all your eggs in either party's basket.'' He is helping with the visit, he says, out of concern that Mr. Putin is becoming so closely identified with President Clinton and Democrats that Russia could become ''a whipping boy'' in this year's presidential election. Actually, the visit is just the latest overture by Putin allies to reach out to the Republican Party. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met in April with Governor George W. Bush (much as Boris Yeltsin met with Democratic candidate Bill Clinton early in the 1992 campaign). Democratic officials say they know of no plans for Russians to visit their convention in Los Angeles.</p>
