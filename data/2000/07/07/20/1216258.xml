        <p>By now, most people have heard the sensational charge that Hillary Clinton let loose an anti-Semitic slur against her husband's Congressional campaign manager 26 years ago. The accusation appears in ''State of a Union,'' a book that purports to examine the Clintons' marriage and is yet another in a long line of books that delight in and profit from bashing the first couple.</p>
        <p>In researching my political biography of Mrs. Clinton in 1995, I conducted several lengthy interviews with the sources of this story, Paul and Mary Lee Fray. While they did describe in colorful detail a shouting match between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Fray in campaign headquarters, they never mentioned Mrs. Clinton's alleged -- and, one has to think, unforgettable -- use of an ugly anti-Semitic epithet against him. Apparently, in their dealings with Jerry Oppenheimer, a former National Enquirer reporter and author of the new book, the Frays' memory was somehow enhanced.</p>

        <p>By now, most people have heard the sensational charge that Hillary Clinton let loose an anti-Semitic slur against her husband's Congressional campaign manager 26 years ago. The accusation appears in ''State of a Union,'' a book that purports to examine the Clintons' marriage and is yet another in a long line of books that delight in and profit from bashing the first couple.</p>
        <p>In researching my political biography of Mrs. Clinton in 1995, I conducted several lengthy interviews with the sources of this story, Paul and Mary Lee Fray. While they did describe in colorful detail a shouting match between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Fray in campaign headquarters, they never mentioned Mrs. Clinton's alleged -- and, one has to think, unforgettable -- use of an ugly anti-Semitic epithet against him. Apparently, in their dealings with Jerry Oppenheimer, a former National Enquirer reporter and author of the new book, the Frays' memory was somehow enhanced.</p>
        <p>But this incident is about more than recovered memory; it's about authors anxious to make news in order to sell their books. The current flap reminds  me of my own difficult experience. My book, ''The Seduction of Hillary Rodham,'' was widely anticipated on the political right as the October surprise that would swing the 1996 election to the Republicans. Having whetted the appetites of the Clinton-hating audience with a lurid article in The American Spectator about the president's alleged past sexual infidelities, an article I now regret having written, and working under the pressure of justifying a huge advance, I struggled mightily with giving my readers what I knew they wanted: Hillary Clinton in leg irons.</p>
        <p>I couldn't do it. The facts weren't there, nor was I willing any longer to  use innuendo and unverified charges to spice up my material, which I had done in the past. After the book was published, I found myself picking up the pieces of a broken career as a right-wing muckraker, but I was proud of my book even though it had trouble in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>All authors of big nonfiction books face the arduous task of generating headlines to spur book sales. Too often, authors succumb to market pressures by trafficking in rumor, using unreliable sources or embellishing their material, all in the service of hype and buzz. Publishing houses are notoriously lax about fact-checking. Books are rarely retracted or even corrected. Most authors caught short, and I speak from experience, are able to bluster their way through the controversies incited by their shaky work. Sad to say, the controversies themselves are good for business.</p>
        <p>In writing about the Clintons, the phenomenon is magnified greatly. For one thing, it's incredibly hard to unearth new revelations about the first couple after a decade of examination by zealous prosecutors, Republican-led Congressional committees and a feverish press corps.</p>
        <p>Serious, respected authors do try to present new material. In ''The Choice'' a book on the 1996 presidential campaign, Bob Woodward portrayed what Mrs. Clinton said were unremarkable brainstorming sessions with friends as loopy imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>In ''Hillary's Choice,'' Gail Sheehy read immense psychological significance into Mrs. Clinton's father's absence from her Wellesley commencement speech. Oops: He was there, according to the first lady's aides.</p>
        <p>Other authors have sought to exploit a truth about the market: Anti-Clinton books sell. Gary Aldrich, a former F.B.I. agent, was the first to tap into this vein with ''Unlimited Access,'' a  1996 best seller filled with highly charged allegations that even the author conceded were ''hypothetical.'' His publisher, Regnery, then churned out a slew of anti-Clinton books, many nothing more than conspiratorial fantasy -- and sold them mostly through right-wing book clubs.</p>
        <p>Mainstream book publishers soon followed. In just the last year, three authors -- the biographer Joyce Milton, the Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan and Laura Ingraham, a conservative pundit -- jumped on the Hillary-bashing gravy train.</p>
        <p>By now, the self-promotion game is elementary, and Mr. Oppenheimer seems to be playing it expertly. In a way, you have to admire the man's ingenuity. Until now, no one has come close to Kenneth Starr's report to Congress for shocking Clinton news.</p>
        <p>But one leak about the Oppenheimer book to the Drudge Report, an anti-Clinton Web site, is all it took to reactivate the lucrative right-wing talk-show machinery and the New York tabloids. Then came the down-channel cable talk shows. Now, Mr. Oppenheimer's book is moving up the charts at Amazon. This is all depressingly predictable: The more implausible the charge, the more it runs counter to everything we know about the subject, the more news and sales it generates.</p>
        <p>For eight years, Hillary Clinton has been portrayed (by me, among countless others) as a bleeding-heart liberal. Now, she's suddenly a bigot.</p>
        <p>I don't buy it. And I hope we've read the last book bashing the Clintons.</p>
