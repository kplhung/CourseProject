        <p>Honor Bound  Ushering in a new annual accolade, the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music will present its first Brooklyn Conservatory of Music Award to the jazz pianist, composer and educator Billy Taylor. The unrestricted cash prize of $25,000 will be presented on Sept. 18 at a benefit for student scholarships at the Supper Club in Manhattan. The conservatory has been offering community music education since 1897.</p>
        <p>Tango Time  From composers like Astor Piazzolla, Carlos Guastavino and Dorival Cayimi come the tangos and other exotic rhythms that will be heard when the Bronx Arts Ensemble's SummerMusic 2000 series of concert doubleheaders opens on Sunday. The first of the day's free concerts will be offered at 2 p.m. in Van Cortlandt Park at Rockwood Drive Circle, near Mosholu Avenue and Broadway. The second takes place at 4 p.m. in Keating Hall Auditorium on Fordham University's Rose Hill Campus. Other doubleheaders in the series, these in Van Cortlandt Park and at McGinley Center at Fordham, include a Baroque concert on July 30 and popular marches and arrangements for brass quintet on Aug. 6 In the event of rain, the 2 p.m. concerts will move to the Church of the Mediator, West 231st Street and Kingsbridge Avenue.</p>
        <p>Ringmasters  Clowns, trapeze artists, acrobats and tigers under a crimson and gold-crested big top are making the rounds of Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens in the form of the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus. The troupe is appearing through Sunday in Marine Park at Avenue U in Brooklyn; from July 24 through 27 in Midland Beach Park at Father Capodanno Boulevard on Staten Island, and from July 28 through 30 at Victory Field in Forest Park, off Woodhaven Boulevard at Myrtle Avenue in Queens. Early birds who want to see the elephants help raise the circus tent in time-honored fashion are advised to turn up between 8 a.m. and 9:30.</p>
        <p>High Art  In the Swiss Alps, some of the world's foremost musicians will gather tomorrow, the opening of the seventh annual Verbier Festival and Academy. Among the highlights of this year's festival, running through Aug. 6, are James Levine and Evgeny Kissin in works for two pianos, and the pianist Martha Argerich joining the violinist Vadim Repin and Mr. Kissin for a chamber performance. The Verbier Festival Youth Orchestra will make its debut under the baton of Mr. Levine in a program of Mahler, Dvorak, Gershwin and Schubert.</p>
