        <p>The American Superconductor Corporation and Rockwell Automation, a division of Rockwell International, said yesterday that they had passed a key milestone in government-sponsored research to develop high-temperature superconducting motors by successfully operating the world's first 1,000-horsepower unit using such technology. American Superconductor said it was on track to test a 5,000-horsepower unit -- the prototype for its first commercial product -- next spring.
