        <p>Bill Clinton today was a president caught between two summit meetings, one in Camp David dealing with the oldest and thorniest problems in diplomacy, the other in Japan approaching the newest and vaguest issues of global inequity.</p>
        <p>The meeting on the Maryland mountaintop was grueling, but Mr. Clinton was not going to leave while there was even a glimmer of hope that he might achieve a legacy-enhancing breakthrough in the pursuit of Middle East peace.</p>
        <p>And for him, the Group of 8 meeting in Okinawa, in southern Japan, has less to recommend it -- save for the fact that he would be the star and the issues, from bringing the Internet to developing nations to funding a global battle against AIDS, resonate with the themes he has tried to place on the international agenda.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's mind this week has clearly been on the older issues, not the newer ones he came to office promising to tackle. In fact, he has yet to be briefed on his role at the meeting beginning on Friday of leaders of seven leading industrialized nations, and with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers preceded Mr. Clinton to Japan to warm the president's seat and reassure the Japanese that he would be there eventually. Traveling with him was the chief person organizing the American part in the talks, Lael Brainard, who was to have briefed Mr. Clinton on Air Force One.</p>
        <p>''So we'll wing it,'' one White House official said.</p>
        <p>Meetings of the group are notoriously disjointed, but the agenda for this session is particularly scattered.</p>
        <p>Leaders will discuss the ''digital divide'' between those nations taking advantage of the information revolution and those that are not; coordinated approaches to the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; and even a United States-backed proposal to create an international school lunch program.</p>
        <p>''You can't say the issues are unimportant, but they are a laundry list and some of them don't meet my criteria for being the top global concerns,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, for example, the leaders promised to focus on remaking the international financial system until safeguards were in place to prevent another economic crisis like the one that struck Asia in 1997 from radiating around world markets.</p>
        <p>But a recovery shortened the group's collective memory, and while modest progress has been made, one would have to dig far into the fine print to find that discussion on this year's agenda.</p>
        <p>On the national security front, the  meeting will grapple with more standard issues -- terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons, turmoil in Africa, Chechnya and the Balkans. But those conversations tend to be as scripted as the summit communique, a reason that Mr. Clinton appeared far less eager to meet his fellow leaders than to play out his role as potential Middle East peacemaker.</p>
        <p>That forced Mr. Clinton to postpone a meeting with the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, whose days are considered numbered because of his party's poor showing in an election last month.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton also skipped one of the unique aspects of this meeting -- a gathering of the leaders of developing countries such as Algeria, Nigeria, South Africa and Thailand, all of whom have long complained that they are excluded from the elite club of large economies. Mr. Summers will see them instead, but the smaller nations are bound to view Mr. Clinton's no-show as a snub.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton plans to hold meetings with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and a session with Mr. Putin that is expected to address Mr. Clinton's looming decision on a national missile defense system.</p>
        <p>''The president, I'm sure, will want to take advantage of having the leaders there to discuss the issues that are facing him,'' said James Steinberg, deputy national security adviser. ''I think that he will indicate that he is going to take into account the concerns that have been addressed,'' particularly ''four basic variables of cost, threat, technical feasibility and the impact on overall security.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's late arrival shows how much has changed since his first step into global diplomacy, also in Japan. It was July 1993, and world leaders took turns beating up on Mr. Clinton for the size of the American budget deficit and Washington's failure to stabilize the world economy.</p>
        <p>This time, America's economy is supreme and Mr. Clinton arrives as the indispensable peacemaker.</p>
