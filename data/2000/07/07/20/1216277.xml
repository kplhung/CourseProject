        <p>Despite declining sales, I.B.M. managed to surprise Wall Street yesterday with earnings of $1.9 billion for the second quarter, up 12 percent from the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>That works out to $1.06 a share, well above the $1 Wall Street expected.</p>
        <p>The company compensated for weak sales, especially of personal computers and mainframes, through strict cost controls. It also bought back $1.8 billion of its stock, increasing the per-share earnings.</p>
        <p>Analysts dismissed the share buybacks and cost cutting as necessary evils.</p>
        <p>''I.B.M. has not been getting credit for beating the earnings estimates,'' said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs. ''Their revenues are so sorry looking, you wouldn't want to give them the wrong idea. The truth of the matter is that the market needs to see revenue turn around and they know it.''</p>
        <p>But analysts took heart that I.B.M. did not back off its optimistic forecasts for the second half of the year, despite more negative assessments given in recent weeks by services companies like Electronic Data Systems and software companies like Computer Associates.</p>
        <p>''Investors were nervous that I.B.M. would back off from the second half and they didn't do that,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>In after-hours trading, I.B.M.'s shares rose to $109, after closing at $104.16, up $1.28, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>In a long conference call with analysts, I.B.M. executives detailed signs of improvement in most of its business lines.</p>
        <p>Most notably, I.B.M.'s fast growing Global Services division, which designs and operates computer systems for other companies, signed new contracts worth $20 billion over the next several years, far more than analysts had expected.</p>
        <p>Also, the company reduced the loss in its personal computer business to $69 million, from $100 million a year earlier, and John R. Joyce, the company's chief financial officer, told analysts the unit should break even by the end of the year. He said that in the second quarter, 24 percent of the company's PC sales were direct to customers, rather than through dealers, up from 19 percent in the previous three months. By the end of the year, he said, direct sales, the technique used to great effect by Dell Computer, should be 35 percent of I.B.M.'s PC sales.</p>
        <p>Other strong areas included Unix servers and storage systems, both in increasing demand by companies operating web sites.</p>
        <p>By contrast, I.B.M. said the rise in the dollar reduced sales overseas by 1 percent in dollar terms. And it said it was having continued difficulty with its hard disk drive business.</p>
        <p>Overall, hardware revenue fell by 4.9 percent, to $9.2 billion. Services revenue increased by 2.4 percent, to $8.2 billion. Software revenue advanced 1.7 percent, to $3.2 billion. And financing revenue rose by 10.1 percent, to $819 million.</p>
        <p>The company said its services revenue actually grew by 10 percent when it excluded figures for its network services unit, which I.B.M. sold to AT&amp;T last year, and for services related to the Year 2000 computer bug, demand for which has fallen off sharply.</p>
        <p>Sales declined in the Americas and Europe, but increased sharply in Asia.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  July 24, 2000, Monday  An article in Business Day on Thursday about the quarterly earnings of I.B.M. referred imprecisely to a warning issued recently by Electronic Data Systems. The company said last month that its revenue would be less than expected in the quarter ended June 30; the assessment did not refer to the second half of the year.</p>
