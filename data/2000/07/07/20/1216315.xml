        <p>Andy Morales, a standout with the Cuban national baseball team, has succeeded in his second attempt to flee Cuba for the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morales was being interviewed by the federal authorities here tonight after being smuggled with 8 others to the Florida Keys.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morales is a 25-year-old third baseman who hit a three-run home run in the Cuban national team's victory over the host Baltimore Orioles last year. Last month, he was refused asylum along with 30 others after they were intercepted at sea by the Coast Guard.</p>
        <p>This time, Mr. Morales, seven other men and a 16-year-old girl  reached the Marquesas, a group of islands west of Key West. Under federal rules, Cuban refugees who actually reach United States soil are usually allowed to stay, while those intercepted at sea are returned.</p>
        <p>''They made it to U.S. territory,'' a Border Patrol spokesman, Joe Mellia, said today.</p>
        <p>The Border Patrol interviewed each of the Cubans separately in its Pembroke Pines, Fla., office, Mr. Mellia said, and several said they had paid $5,000 each to be smuggled here.</p>
        <p>After being interviewed by the Border Patrol, the nine were taken to a detention center here for questioning by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>Rene Guim, a spokesman for Mr. Morales's agent, Gus Dominguiz of Los Angeles, said Mr. Morales had been harassed and beaten after he was repatriated.</p>
        <p>''Cuban security people were following him everywhere,'' Mr. Guim said. Mr. Guim said that a week ago, Mr. Morales got into ''a little push and shove'' with three security personnel. ''They pushed him in an alley and beat the heck out of him,'' Mr. Guim said. ''I think that's probably what broke the camel's back.''</p>
