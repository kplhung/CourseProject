        <p>A federal jury has awarded $1.55 million in damages to a former Nassau County correction officer who says his supervisors looked on as his co-workers at the county jail repeatedly tormented him because he is gay.</p>
        <p>The verdict, reached Tuesday night after a three-week trial in Federal District Court in Uniondale, is thought to be only the second in New York State in which a government  has been found liable for failing to stop harassment of a gay employee, legal experts said. In the other case, a federal jury also ruled against Nassau County, ordering it last year to pay $500,000 in damages to a gay county police officer.</p>

        <p>A federal jury has awarded $1.55 million in damages to a former Nassau County correction officer who says his supervisors looked on as his co-workers at the county jail repeatedly tormented him because he is gay.</p>
        <p>The verdict, reached Tuesday night after a three-week trial in Federal District Court in Uniondale, is thought to be only the second in New York State in which a government  has been found liable for failing to stop harassment of a gay employee, legal experts said. In the other case, a federal jury also ruled against Nassau County, ordering it last year to pay $500,000 in damages to a gay county police officer.</p>
        <p>The former correction officer, James Manning, 36, who joined the Sheriff's Department in 1990, sued the county, saying that the slurs and indignities began in earnest in 1992 when he was assigned to the visiting area of the Nassau County Jail, and continued almost daily over three years.</p>
        <p>He said his co-workers called him offensive names and hung photographic collages and cartoons on the walls of the visiting room depicting him as a pedophile, a transsexual and someone who engaged in bestiality. In one incident, he said, a co-worker threw a chair at him. Despite his complaints, his supervisors did nothing to stop the abuse, he said.</p>
        <p>The jury took about five hours to find that the Nassau County Sheriff's Department ''has a custom and practice of discriminating against homosexuals'' and that top officials in the department ''were deliberately indifferent to the constitutional right of correction officers to be free from sexual orientation discrimination.''</p>
        <p>Paul F. Millus, the lawyer representing Nassau County, issued a statement today saying that he thought the verdict was incorrect and that the county was considering an appeal.</p>
        <p>The award is a financial blow to the county, which is struggling to cut millions from its budget as part of a state bailout plan. The county paid the earlier award to the police officer only after the officer's lawyer froze $1 million in county assets.</p>
        <p>In the recent trial, Mr. Manning told the jury that he had pleaded with his supervisors to ''make the harassment stop.'' But not only did his supervisors do nothing to staunch the abuse, Mr. Manning testified, but they also watched and laughed as it took place.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Manning said the posting of the pictures turned his ordeal into a public humiliation. ''They put them up where the inmates could see them, where the public could see them and where the bosses could see them,'' he said. ''The bosses knew all about it. They laughed at it. They thought it was funny.''</p>
        <p>When no disciplinary action was taken, Mr. Manning quit. He says he became psychologically unstable, felt shooting pains in his arms, developed hypertension and twice attempted suicide.</p>
        <p>It is extremely difficult for gay men and lesbians in New York State to sue for harassment in the workplace because there are no federal, state or county laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, legal experts said.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Manning's lawyers, who also represented the gay county police officer, James M. Quinn, last year in his successful suit against the county, sued under the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. Judge Joanna Seybert of Federal District Court in Uniondale agreed that their interpretation of the Constitution held merit and allowed the case to go to a jury, the lawyers said.</p>
        <p>''There is a solid precedent set here,'' said Lenard Leeds, one of the lawyers. ''Today's award is three times greater than the last and it sends a clear message: homophobic attacks and slurs will not be tolerated in the workplace.''</p>
        <p>In his statement today, Mr. Millus, the Nassau County lawyer, said the county had had a policy prohibiting discrimination in the workplace since January 1996. Mr. Millus said the county was considering an appeal based on the grounds that the 14th Amendment prohibits discrimination based on sex but not sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>''While all discrimination in the workplace is unacceptable,'' Mr. Millus said, ''it is up to the Legislature and Congress to set specific prohibitions addressing sexual orientation and not to expand public employer liability.''</p>
        <p>Leaders of groups representing gay public employees were heartened by today's decision.</p>
        <p>''It's encouraging that there is a second case in Nassau County,'' said Lt. Don Jirak of the New York City Police Department and president of the Gay Officers Action League. ''It shows us that protection might not be spelled out for gay men and lesbians in the law, but that juries see fit to include protection for all employees.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 27, 2000, Thursday  An article last Thursday about a Nassau County jail guard who won a lawsuit contending that he was harassed for being gay misstated his reason for filing under the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. No federal, state or Nassau County law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. But such laws indeed exist in some jurisdictions in the state: 17 other municipalities, including 10 counties, have them.</p>
