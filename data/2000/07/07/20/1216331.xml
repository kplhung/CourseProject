        <p>The utility man Lenny Harris is leading off and starting at third base for the Mets, and he may soon take on another role: recruiter.</p>
        <p>If the Mets make a deal for the Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin, Harris could entice him to accept the trade.</p>
        <p>Harris and Larkin were teammates for five years, and they remain close friends, speaking frequently by telephone. When they talked a couple of days ago, Larkin mentioned he had heard his name linked to the Mets in trade rumors.</p>
        <p>The Dayton Daily News is reporting in its Thursday editions that Reds General Manager Jim Bowden said he believes he is very close to trading Larkin, possibly in the next couple of days. Larkin, who is hitting .329 with 10 home runs and 34 runs batted in, has more than 10 years in the majors and the last five with the Reds, so he must approve any deal.</p>
        <p>Harris could make the Mets' case, but the Mets must do most of the work. Larkin, who can be a free agent at the end of the year, wants a contract extension.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't feel he's in that renting situation,'' Harris said. ''I know he doesn't want to come here or anywhere else to visit for two months. He'd want to stay for a while.''</p>
        <p>Larkin said on Tuesday that Reds Chief Operating Officer John Allen told him in a meeting that he did not want to re-sign him. Larkin's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, could not say for certain if Larkin would require a new contract to approve a trade.</p>
        <p>''Right now, he's just planning on playing out the season with the Reds,'' Goldschmidt said.</p>
        <p>''If a couple of options get presented to us, we'd have to look at the circumstances involved with the trade. Does the team want to talk about a contract, or just rent him for two months?''</p>
        <p>Today, Larkin told reporters: ''I'm not done yet. If the Reds don't want me, I know I could go play well somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>The Reds recently traded pitcher Denny Neagle to the Yankees, and Eric Goldschmidt, Larkin's agent, said New York's other team would have a lot to offer the shortstop.</p>
        <p>''They have a lot of good qualities,'' he said. ''They play on grass, they're competitive, there's a big gate and they play in front of big crowds. There are a lot of attractive features about a lot of the clubs.''</p>
        <p>Other teams that may be pursuing Larkin include the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips does not talk about specific trade plans. But when asked if he could use most of his best trading chips on one player, he said, ''That's possible.''</p>
        <p>Phillips, who said the Mets' main need continues to be pitching, added: ''We have enough to be involved in some major discussions.''</p>
        <p>Larkin reportedly wanted a three-year, $27.9 million extension from the Reds, and Goldschmidt said those numbers were close to accurate. The Mets already owe $16 million over the next three years to shortstop Rey Ordonez, who is out for the year with a broken left arm, and they are enticed by the idea of signing Alex Rodriguez as a free agent this winter.</p>
        <p>But Larkin would steady the Mets' infield now. Phillips has consistently acknowledged that he is exploring deals for a shortstop, and he said the performance of Ordonez's replacement, Melvin Mora, has done nothing to change his stance.</p>
        <p>''You have to look at it and say, Mora's done a heck of a job,'' Harris said. ''I think we can do it without Barry Larkin. It'd be nice to have him, but we've got to win with what we have here.''</p>
        <p>Phillips, who has not made a trade since early June, does want to do something before the July 31 trading deadline, as does Manager Bobby Valentine. ''I wouldn't mind if a deal could improve our team,'' Valentine said. ''But I haven't discussed those things.''</p>
        <p>Harris knows a player like Larkin would help the Mets, and he thinks Larkin would welcome the chance to do so.</p>
        <p>''I would think he wants to win,'' Harris said.</p>
        <p>Protest Denied</p>
        <p>The Mets were told today that Major League Baseball denied their protest of the first game of the July 8 doubleheader with the Yankees. Jimmie Lee Solomon of the commissioner's office told Phillips the umpires believed Chuck Knoblauch would have been safe at second base on his first-inning double had first baseman Todd Zeile not obstructed his path to the base.</p>
