        <p>ON a hectic Friday morning, the first stop for the white plumbing van was . . . the beach. ''Sometimes it helps to pay a visit to the waves before I start dealing with the people,'' said Bob Donohue, one of a handful of veteran air-conditioning repairmen in the Hamptons.</p>

        <p>ON a hectic Friday morning, the first stop for the white plumbing van was . . . the beach. ''Sometimes it helps to pay a visit to the waves before I start dealing with the people,'' said Bob Donohue, one of a handful of veteran air-conditioning repairmen in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>But on this particular morning, Mr. Donohue found no time for reflection.</p>
        <p>There was a knock on the van's door.</p>
        <p>''Excuse me, but are you a plumber?'' asked a kindly looking middle-aged man, out walking his springer spaniel. ''I'm having a problem with the -- what do you call it? -- thermostat.''</p>
        <p>Ah, this must be summer. And in the summer here, it is not the homeowners who reign. Underpinning almost every house is a network of people, a veritable phalanx of well-paid but indefatigable workers.</p>
        <p>These are the Heroes of the Hamptons: The air-conditioning men, the electricians, the rose pruners, the hedge trimmers, the house watchers and the rest of the men and women who keep every weathered shingled cottage -- owned or rented -- ticking away like a gold Rolex.</p>
        <p>Tree man, anyone?</p>
        <p>''You've got to have a tree guy,'' said Jeffrey Fisher, the homeowner who knocked on Mr. Donohue's van door. ''Then there's the hot-pot person -- the one who plants your pots on the terrace. Now, who else do we have? The plumber, the boiler man, the house watcher, the house cleaner, the pest control guy, the lawn mower guy, the turf guy, the irrigation guy, the pool person and the pool heater person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher questions the competence of a plumbing company that did recent work, but he's afraid to say anything negative.</p>
        <p>''I might scare them away,'' he said timidly. Because the savvy homeowners know that money can't buy everything, even in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>''One very well known man arrived here to find his air-conditioning wasn't working,'' said Diane Saatchi, a local real estate broker. ''He called up the air-conditioning man and started screaming. When he stopped, the repair man, without raising his voice, said: 'Listen, pal, there are hundreds of millionaires like you out here. There are only two air-conditioning repairmen.' ''</p>
        <p>Then the repair guy hung up, she said. ''He didn't need the work.''</p>
        <p>Nan Noel, a jacqueline-of-all-trades, often turns down clients.</p>
        <p>''Just this week, someone called who had been referred by someone else and asked if I could come over,'' said Ms. Noel, who arranges for house cleaning, car washing, dog grooming and just about anything a lord or lady of the manor could need. ''These people wanted me to stay there -- right then -- while the movers came.'' She declined the job. ''I could see in advance what they would expect. These people had no boundaries!''</p>
        <p>For others, however, she provides a big chunk of the good life.</p>
        <p>''One woman is an editor in New York, and she doesn't get here until 2 or 3 in the morning,'' said Ms. Noel, who, among other things, boards the editor's dog during the week. ''She likes to sleep until 11:30 Saturday morning, so I never disturb her. But on Saturday afternoon, I arrive with her dog, her newspaper -- and her strawberry muffins.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Noel charges $35 an hour for her own time, and works mainly with regular clients. Then she passes on the charges of the maintenance people she employs. This week, she picked up a reporter in a black BMW with the top down. Was it her car? ''No,'' she replied. ''It belongs to a client. I'm getting it fixed.'' What's wrong with it? She pointed to a two-inch black speaker cover. ''It fell off,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As tiny rocks the color of butterscotch pudding crunched beneath her wheels, she turned into one of those long Hamptons driveways; the house invisible through the white-painted security gates. ''See that broken gate?'' she said. ''Bashed by a big truck delivering the dryer.'' Farther along, she waved to a man getting out of another black BMW convertible. The owner? No, one of her employees. The car had to be washed before the owners returned. A shiny burgundy-colored minivan gleamed. ''The staff car,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>Besides their automobiles, Hamptonites like their grass to be perfect.</p>
        <p>One oceanfront cottage was surrounded by swathes of ferns and naturalistic plantings. But there was something odd -- too perfect -- about the lawn on the hillside. ''It's all sod,'' said Craig Socia, a garden designer, who supervises the maintenance of 33 houses in the Hamptons. ''We had it laid this spring.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Socia, who also designs twig follies, declined to discuss how much he charges. He has seven men working for him but insists on doing the delicate pruning himself.</p>
        <p>Just mowing the lawn on the most palatial of these estates can run $500 a week, Mr. Socia said.</p>
        <p>Gregory P. Kirwan, a partner in Casual Water, charges $49.95 a week to service an average pool. ''When I visit my parents in Florida, my relatives in Arizona, I check out the prices,'' he said. ''For what we charge for one week here, they can get a whole month of service there.''</p>
        <p>After the quick stop to look at the waves last Friday, Mr. Donohue, an avid surfer, headed for the first service call.</p>
        <p>There, up a curving gravel driveway, stood the shingled home of Steve and Diane Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson came out the side door to greet Mr. Donohue, who works for Schenck Fuels here. Mr. Donohue bustled into the basement.</p>
        <p>''I had a problem in the basement and I was trying to find the fuse box,'' Mr. Jacobson explained. ''And I walked through some water. A puddle, on the floor.'' He laughed. ''There's no way the city slicker can do without these guys. It'd be better to sell the house and buy a condominium. This company responds right away, but most of the time, they say 'See you in two weeks.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobson, a real estate lawyer, who retired in 1995 to write films and plays, said he was in a bad way because his wife had left their list of tradespeople in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''You're supposed to be out playing tennis and you have to call all these people,'' he grumbled.</p>
        <p>In the basement, Mr. Donohue adjusted the thermostat on the boiler, which someone had turned up to 240 degrees. ''It wasn't me,'' Mr. Jacobson insisted, with a laugh. ''There are spider webs down there; it's scary.''</p>
        <p>LAST year, eight Hamptons houses sold for between $2 million and $3 million in the first three months, according to Cook Pony Farm Real Estate. In the first three months of 2000, there were 20.</p>
        <p>A lot of the new homeowners in the Hamptons are first-time owners.</p>
        <p>''They are so young,'' Ms. Noel said. ''One woman said: 'What do I know about a house? The last place I lived was a dorm.' ''</p>
        <p>What was the problem?</p>
        <p>''There was a fly in her refrigerator,'' Ms. Noel said.</p>
        <p>The young homeowner -- she just closed on her house last week -- was anxious. ''She also was saying her fiance couldn't sleep in the bedroom because it was bright. Well, any hardware store sells blackout blinds. But how would she know that? I asked her where the entrance to the basement was and she said: 'I don't know. Is there a basement?' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Noel pulled into another driveway. ''This house is very old, and there are problems with mold,'' she said. ''I have to check on the dehumidifier. A lot of times, they don't leave it running, and when they come back on a weekend, the basement is filled with spiders.''</p>
        <p>At her clients' homes, Ms. Noel reads the notes left for the staff to troubleshoot any possible hitches.  ''It's all about saving time,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The next stop was a house with a pool, its baby-blue water bebopping in the peekaboo sunlight. ''I get a lot of complaints about pools,'' she said. ''Last year, this pool was almost destroyed. When these people moved in, there was black mud, almost up to the top.''</p>
        <p>One thing the maintenance people dislike is homeowners who try to do their pools -- or anything else -- themselves. ''One client tried to do it himself,'' Ms. Noel said. ''And he stored all these chlorine tablets in the basement; it says right on the bucket you're supposed to store it outside.''</p>
        <p>After struggling with possibly toxic fumes and an unopenable plastic bucket, she gave up and told him to hire a pool service. ''It's people like him who give customers a bad name,'' she said. ''Here he is trying to save $1.50 on this multimillion home.''</p>
        <p>''It's the ones who live in fear of getting ripped off who always get ripped off,'' she added. ''They end up getting second-rate people -- and they probably do get ripped off.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kirwan, the pool man, says he gets most of his angriest calls when new homeowners receive their first bill. ''They call up screaming, because they've gotten a bill for $500 to open their pool,'' he said. ''They don't realize how many chemicals we use. They think we're making money on all these chemicals and they don't really need them.''</p>
        <p>For these customers, who, Ms. Noel said, ''grew up in concrete,'' it is wisest to itemize the bills, especially for the newest homeowners.</p>
        <p>''They ask: 'How could it cost so much?' '' she said. ''I tell them to ask for a detailed bill, that way they can really see how long it takes to do a lot of these things.''</p>
        <p>Over a cup of coffee at the Golden Pear here, Rodney Herrlin and Christopher Schenck, whose great-grandfather started Schenck's, assessed how things have changed. ''It used to be that we knew a lot of our customers 25 or 30 years,'' Mr. Schenck said. ''Now, it's two or three years, they're selling their homes and moving; they aren't setting their roots. It used to be, you'd say: 'You need a new furnace' and they didn't ask 'Why?' and run around getting other estimates.''</p>
        <p>Today's customers are apt to be more impatient, too. ''It gets a little vicious,'' Mr. Herrlin said. ''Especially in the midst of the summer. People just keep calling: 'I called 25 minutes ago and nobody's here yet.' ''</p>
        <p>But those people may be cutting their own throats, maintenance-wise.</p>
        <p>They may not know that it takes several seasons to cultivate a crew. ''Until the tradespeople know you're going to pay the bills and not be abusive to their staff,'' Ms. Saatchi, the real estate agent, explained, ''they may be a little tough to find out here.''</p>
