        <p>Final Notes From Streisand</p>
        <p>New York and Hollywood made BARBRA STREISAND a household name with the stage and screen versions of ''Funny Girl.'' Now her manager, MARTIN ERLICHMAN, says that she will end her live singing career with four performances in those cities -- two concerts at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 20 and 21, and two concerts at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 27 and 28.</p>
        <p>Tickets will be sold through Ticketmaster starting July 30 for the Los Angeles appearances and July 31 for the New York concerts. Prices are not yet set. Tickets for her New Year's Eve concerts in Las Vegas ranged from $500 to $2,500.</p>

        <p>Final Notes From Streisand</p>
        <p>New York and Hollywood made BARBRA STREISAND a household name with the stage and screen versions of ''Funny Girl.'' Now her manager, MARTIN ERLICHMAN, says that she will end her live singing career with four performances in those cities -- two concerts at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sept. 20 and 21, and two concerts at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 27 and 28.</p>
        <p>Tickets will be sold through Ticketmaster starting July 30 for the Los Angeles appearances and July 31 for the New York concerts. Prices are not yet set. Tickets for her New Year's Eve concerts in Las Vegas ranged from $500 to $2,500.</p>
        <p>She may be retiring, but only from singing live in public: Mr. Erlichman issued a statement saying that Ms. Streisand was considering directing another film.</p>
        <p>There are those who wonder whether she can stay retired. ''There are many artists in contemporary music who retire and un-retire,'' said BOB GROSSWEINER, a concert industry analyst. ''There's the Elton John syndrome, the Tina Turner syndrome, who both retired and then came back.''</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for Ms. Streisand, KEN SUNSHINE, said that she was serious about the four concerts being her last. ''This is not somebody who retires every couple of years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Obliged to Grin And Bear It</p>
        <p>When the comedian JACKIE MASON began savaging MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI as usual on Tuesday, he did not know the mayor was in the audience.</p>
        <p>Catching Mr. Mason's one-man show, ''Much Ado About Everything,'' before it closes on July 30, the mayor tried to slip into the Golden Theater with JUDITH NATHAN, the woman he has called his ''very good friend.''</p>
        <p>But his arrival was noticed: the audience gave him an ovation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason did not know that, though. ''I was backstage,'' Mr. Mason said after the performance, ''and I thought, 'I'm such a hit, they're applauding me even before I show up.' ''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Mason went on stage and began his jokes about the mayor, and people in the audience began shouting, ''He's here!'' Not knowing whom they were talking about, Mr. Mason kept telling Giuliani jokes, and people kept shouting.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Mason got the message, and after welcoming Mr. Giuliani, he unleashed yet another round of Giuliani jokes. Then, ''because I am an equal opportunity insulter,'' as he put it afterward, Mr. Mason did some jokes about HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.</p>
        <p>Several audience members said that the mayor laughed at Mr. Mason's punch lines, as did Ms. Nathan and the others who were with them, including DENNISON YOUNG JR., the mayor's counsel, and the lawyer RAOUL FELDER. (The mayor's office did not return a call yesterday seeking comment.)</p>
        <p>After the show, the mayor took Ms. Nathan to Mr. Mason's dressing room, where he said he thought he had come off looking pretty good.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason's response? ''We had to run downstairs to save my car because the mayor's security detail wanted to tow it away.''</p>
        <p>Forget the Car; Save the Pillow!</p>
        <p>FORMER MAYOR EDWARD I. KOCH gets around town during the week (and out to Connecticut and the Hamptons on weekends) in a 1998 Lincoln Town Car. Or he did until it was stolen last week from the street in front of the Queens home of his driver, HOWARD GEARY, a retired police detective.</p>
        <p>The police found the car on Tuesday in Hunters Point, Queens. The windows had been smashed and the battery, tires and mirrors removed, along with a set of keys to Mr. Koch's Greenwich Village apartment. (Note to thief: Forget it. He had the locks changed.)</p>
        <p>Left behind was Mr. Koch's special leather sleeping pillow, which he said he bought last month in East Hampton, on sale, reduced to $32 from $116.</p>
        <p>He uses it for catnaps during the day, which he needs because he gets up at 5 a.m. to hit the gym. ''I'm one of the very few people who can fall asleep instantly anyplace and anytime I want to,'' he said. ''Do you know who else could do that?'' Not pausing for a reply, he gave not one but three answers: ''Churchill, Napoleon and my father.''</p>
