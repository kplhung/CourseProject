        <p>Aetna Inc. has agreed to sell its international and financial services units to the ING Group of the Netherlands for $5 billion in cash, people close to the deal said last night.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, which ING planned to announce before the opening of the stock markets in Europe today, Aetna will create a new health care company that will keep the name Aetna. Aetna's shareholders will receive $35 in cash and one share of the new company in exchange for each share of the old Aetna. ING will also assume $2.7 billion of Aetna's long-term debt.</p>
        <p>ING plans to operate its growing United States financial business from its existing headquarters in Atlanta. It also plans to keep a strong presence in Hartford, where Aetna is based, and in Minneapolis, the headquarters of ReliaStar, another recent purchase by ING, people close to the deal said.</p>
        <p>They said ING had agreed to maintain the number of Aetna employees at close to current levels, with future reductions mainly from attrition as employees retire or leave.</p>
        <p>ING, the Dutch financial giant based in Amsterdam, has made a series of offers to buy parts of Aetna as part of its strategy of becoming one of the 10 largest insurance companies in the United States. Earlier this year, Aetna rejected a tentative offer of $70 a share for the entire company from ING and Wellpoint Health Networks of California. Under that deal, Wellpoint planned to absorb Aetna's health care business.</p>
        <p>Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurance company, has been struggling with unexpected increases in medical costs, which reduced its profits. The company surprised investors on Tuesday by announcing that its second-quarter earnings per share would fall short of Wall Street expectations.</p>
        <p>The company said it would tighten its operations and raise its rates as soon as current contracts expire. Aetna promised to disclose details of its finances when it reports second-quarter profit on Aug. 4.</p>
        <p>Aetna has also been wrestling with money-losing operations of its big Prudential Health Care unit, which it bought last year.</p>
        <p>Investors have been pressing Aetna to sell off units to generate immediate value for shareholders.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said the sale to ING could reduce shareholder value over the long run. Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said before the deal was reached that a sale for less than $12 billion would dilute the value of Aetna's stock.</p>
        <p>The company said on Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings would be 85 to 95 cents a share, well below analysts' estimates of $1.20, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings.</p>
        <p>Aetna said medical costs in its core commercial health maintenance organizations rose 10 percent to 12 percent in the second quarter as members spent more time in hospitals, emergency rooms, outpatient surgery centers and doctors' offices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abramowitz said Aetna would have to raise its rates by 12 percent or more next year to fix its problems, even if resistance to the increase by customers stalled the growth of its membership.</p>
        <p>William H. Donaldson, who took over as chief executive of Aetna in February had said he would split the company into health care and financial units. Several senior health care executives have departed, and Aetna is seeking a new chief executive to run the health care business.</p>
        <p>Several Aetna health care executives left the company this year, and analysts said that absence of experienced senior leaders might have added to the company's operating problems.</p>
