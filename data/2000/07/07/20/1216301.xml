        <p>Acknowledging that the city's projected deficits were ''too large,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would severely curtail tax cuts he planned for this year, impose a partial hiring freeze and reduce some agency spending.</p>
        <p>The most immediate impact of Mr. Giuliani's proposals would be the delay of a planned reduction in the city's personal income tax, originally scheduled to go into effect retroactively to July 1. That was to save city taxpayers an average of about $99 a year, city officials said. Now, the tax cut would most likely be put off until January, city officials said, and even at that point, it might be smaller than planned.</p>

        <p>Acknowledging that the city's projected deficits were ''too large,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would severely curtail tax cuts he planned for this year, impose a partial hiring freeze and reduce some agency spending.</p>
        <p>The most immediate impact of Mr. Giuliani's proposals would be the delay of a planned reduction in the city's personal income tax, originally scheduled to go into effect retroactively to July 1. That was to save city taxpayers an average of about $99 a year, city officials said. Now, the tax cut would most likely be put off until January, city officials said, and even at that point, it might be smaller than planned.</p>
        <p>The announcement came after a growing chorus of criticism by budget monitors of Mr. Giuliani's spending plan for the just-started 2001 fiscal year, which anticipates unusually large budget deficits of about $3 billion a year starting in 2002 and extending through 2004 -- after the mayor leaves office.</p>
        <p>The city, at least three years into an economic boom, remains in good financial condition, the mayor told Gov. George E. Pataki and the other members of the New York State Financial Control Board yesterday at its annual meeting on city budget affairs. The city has had record surpluses in the last three years that have wiped out projected deficits, and no one anticipates that the city will actually wind up, in the near future, in the red.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani -- not wanting to leave the city in the same financial bind he inherited when he arrived in office in 1994 -- said he felt compelled to take steps to reduce the projected deficits, which he attributed in part to actions by the state to increase pension benefits for government employees.</p>
        <p>''Whatever gaps that you see, we could make disappear by playing a game,'' the mayor said, noting that he could merely increase revenue estimates -- reducing the projected deficits -- for future years. ''But it would be a dangerous game, but it is a game the city has played in the past.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the mayor wants to lower those deficit numbers by eliminating about 75 percent of the about $410 million worth of tax cuts proposed for this fiscal year, City Council finance staff estimated yesterday.</p>
        <p>Aside from postponing any reduction in the personal income tax, the city also may scale back or delay a reduction in the tax paid by businesses that rent office or other commercial space, city officials said. Details of the changes in the tax cut plan must be negotiated with the City Council and approved by it.</p>
        <p>The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, who in recent months has gone to great lengths to avoid budget squabbles with the mayor, made clear late yesterday that he disagreed with Mr. Giuliani and wanted the tax cuts the mayor and Council agreed to last month adopted as originally planned.</p>
        <p>''I just spoke with the mayor and told him I was perplexed by the reversal on tax relief,'' Mr. Vallone said in a statement. ''New Yorkers deserve these tax cuts now.''</p>
        <p>Additionally, Mr. Giuliani announced yesterday that he had told city department heads -- with the exception of the schools, police, fire and sanitation -- to temporarily fill only one of every four vacant positions, except jobs supported by grants, mandated by law or necessary to maintain health or safety. The hiring freeze will remain in effect until agencies identify about $200 million worth of cuts in their budgets through June.</p>
        <p>Officials from the New York Public Library, the Parks Department, the Health Department and the Human Resources Administration said yesterday they had not had time to evaluate the hiring freeze and would not comment on the impact it would have on services.</p>
        <p>But Adam L. Barsky, Mr. Giuliani's director of Management and Budget, said he was confident the hiring freeze and spending reductions -- which are similar to measures imposed in previous years of Mr. Giuliani's tenure -- would have a limited effect on city government.</p>
        <p>''We do not expect any reduction in services,'' Mr. Barsky said.</p>
        <p>The city has for many years had a practice of projecting deficits in future budget years, predictions that for at least two decades have proved to be unfounded, as the city has ended up collecting more tax revenues or grants or has cut its spending to ensure that the budget has been balanced.</p>
        <p>The challenge in 2002, the mayor said, results from the fact that tax cuts that he, the Council and the State Legislature approved in past years have reduced revenues expected in the next several years. Additionally, the Legislature voted last month to give retired government workers automatic annual increases in their pensions, a package that is projected to cost the city $98 million this year and $586 million by 2005.</p>
        <p>Given these and other actions, the city's projected deficits have jumped by 70 percent since April, deficits that the mayor yesterday said ''can be remedied, but they are going to require a pretty strict financial plan.'' He has proposed a series of cuts and revisions in this year's $37.6 billion budget that would reduce the projected deficit by $1.1 billion for 2002.</p>
        <p>The mayor's actions came yesterday after several budget monitors -- including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi -- had expressed concern about the rate of spending growth  projected for next year, which they estimated would be at least 7.5 percent, a figure the mayor disputes.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall said yesterday that he welcomed the mayor's plan, but wanted to see if the mayor actually followed through. ''This is a proposal; the question is does it become a fact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Control Board, set up during the fiscal crisis to oversee the city budget, did not hesitate to unanimously approve its annual resolution declaring the city financially fit enough to maintain its financial independence.</p>
