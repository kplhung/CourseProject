        <p>Coca-Cola Co says its second-quarter earnings slightly beat analysts' expectations; net income fell to $926 milion from $942 million a year ago; revenue rose 5 percent, to $5.62 billion from $5.33 billion (M)</p>

        <p>Declaring that its six-month-old ''think local, act local'' strategy was working in some parts of the world, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings slightly beat analysts' expectations, mainly because of savings from a sweeping reorganization this year.</p>
        <p>Net income fell to $926 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, from $942 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $5.62 billion from $5.33 billion, mostly because of price increases in some countries and improving economic conditions in others, the company said.</p>

        <p>Declaring that its six-month-old ''think local, act local'' strategy was working in some parts of the world, the Coca-Cola Company said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings slightly beat analysts' expectations, mainly because of savings from a sweeping reorganization this year.</p>
        <p>Net income fell to $926 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, from $942 million, or 38 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $5.62 billion from $5.33 billion, mostly because of price increases in some countries and improving economic conditions in others, the company said.</p>
        <p>Excluding charges of $191 million, or 5 cents a share, for the reorganization, in which 5,200 employees were laid off, and 2 cents a share to reduce inventory of concentrate, profit was $1.2 billion, or 44 cents a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 41 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>The inventory reduction, in which Coke stopped selling concentrate to bottlers that had bloated inventories, was announced in January as part of Coke's efforts to rebuild its global business. That was when Coke officials also said they would decentralize many of the company's operations and put more authority into the hands of local management.</p>
        <p>One money manager questioned the inventory charge, saying it was not accompanied by a dollar amount on the company's income statement and therefore could not be properly analyzed by investors.</p>
        <p>''They are trying to give themselves credit for business they did not do,'' said James S. Chanos, who runs the Kynikos Fund. ''To say that their business would have been X if they had been able to ship the concentrate that they shipped and booked last year is an unbelievable example of accounting arrogance. Where is the audit committee?''</p>
        <p>A Coke spokesman, Rob Baskin, said the charge amounted to $80 million. ''We don't have it as a line item because it is a reconciling charge,'' he said. ''We are noting that we did not ship that concentrate in the second quarter of this year. We did ship it in the second quarter of 1999.''</p>
        <p>The company said its volume, measured in cases of soft drinks, grew 7 percent in the quarter, including volume growth from the Cadbury Schweppes brands acquired last year. Without the Cadbury brands, volume rose about 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Local marketing efforts in Germany, where a campaign is directed at German teenagers, produced volume growth of 9 percent, the company said. Germany is Coke's fourth-largest overseas market. In the United States, where Coke's biggest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, said on Tuesday that volume would be flat or rise just 1 percent this year, Coke plans an intensive marketing effort in the second half of this year. The company will also introduce certain brands regionally, like Fanta, and emphasize ''pervasiveness'' of its products in places like convenience stores and offices, said Coke's president, Jack L. Stahl.</p>
        <p>Douglas N. Daft, the chairman and chief executive, told analysts during a conference call, ''I'm happy with the improving trends in the business, and to see and feel and touch the improvement in the mindset of our people around the world.''</p>
        <p>Investors lifted shares of Coke $2.31.25, to $60.50.</p>
        <p>Analysts seemed positive, too, though they noted that Coke's second quarter last year was one of its worst, including a big product recall in parts of Europe.</p>
        <p>''I am more encouraged than I was after the April meeting,'' said Jennifer Solomon at Salomon Smith Barney, referring to a meeting in New York where Coke's senior management presided over a five-hour marathon of commercials and presentations on marketing efforts around the world that generally fell flat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daft said then that he expected volume to increase 5 to 6 percent this year, and 7 to 8 percent over the long term. In the conference call yesterday, he and other Coke executives said they were ''comfortable'' with those projections.</p>
        <p>Several analysts questioned Mr. Daft about possible changes in Coke's bottling system. With the emphasis on local decision making, some analysts expect Mr. Daft to break up some of the larger bottlers or find alternatives to what one called the ''pan-regional'' system now in place, in which Coca-Cola Amatil, based in Sydney, Australia, oversees operations stretching from there to the Philippines, and Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, has 74 percent of Coke's business in the United States and five Western European countries.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Daft outlined what he called ''a broad-based, broad-front approach to what is a very complex issue,'' saying that technology and an emphasis on building relationships were enabling changes in Coke's dealings with its bottlers. At another point in the call, he said that volume growth would mean improved results for Coke and the bottlers, which he described more than once as ''interdependent.''</p>
