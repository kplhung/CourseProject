        <p>Almost seven decades after the end of Prohibition, 75 of Kentucky's 120 counties remain dry by local choice, but the pressures to go wet -- or ''moist,'' the new limited imbibing option devised by frustrated state legislators -- are mounting against the state's temperance leaders.</p>
        <p>The question of going wet will be  back before voters on Tuesday in dry Grant County, once rural but now rapidly suburbanizing, with this community one of the fastest growing. Civic leaders have been wondering what mysterious force conducted the discreet petition drive that put the issue on the ballot with 1,115 signatures, something of a local shock. Was it, as many townspeople speculate, a cabal of business executives wary of being denounced in this rigorously Christian bluegrass county?</p>
        <p>''No, it was just me,'' said Dara Florek, a 29-year-old native of these rolling hills. ''I've done it all by myself.''</p>
        <p>An office worker impressed by the growth and arrival of young people, Mrs. Florek said she just decided it was time that the options of modern life be fully faced.</p>
        <p>''I kind of kept this hush-hush because I wanted to sneak up on the dry side,'' she said in an interview after  being identified as the organizer of the petition in the fine print of a pro-wet advertisement in the local weekly newspaper. She collected 300 more signatures than required.</p>
        <p>The ballot question of permitting the sale of alcoholic beverages in Grant County is of no small moment, as only 30 of the state's 120 counties have opted to go wet since Prohibition was repealed in 1933. But the pro-dry ramparts appear to be weakening, as indicated by close margins in various county votes. Over the years, 15 other counties have evolved as mixed, or moist, with the largest cities authorized to go their own way within dry counties.</p>
        <p>But a new state law, passed in the closing hours of this year's Legislature, is designed to promulgate the  ''moist'' option down to small jurisdictions and might considerably liberalize life in dry counties. The law permits even the smallest communities to vote on whether to end the alcohol ban in local restaurants with 100 or more table settings, even if the surrounding county stays dry.</p>
        <p>The House Speaker, Larry Clark, said he had moved the measure as a relatively conservative response to complaints that various regions were losing out in the competition for tourism and convention business.</p>
        <p>''Progress can be a wild ride,'' said the Rev. David Tucker, pastor of the Sherman Baptist Church here and one of the leaders of KIDS (Keep It Dry and Safe), the anti-wet coalition hurriedly organized by local church and civic leaders when the ballot petition surfaced last month.</p>
        <p>''We're at a crossroads,'' Mr. Tucker said of Grant County's growth rate, one of the state's highest. Grant's population has more than doubled in the last decade to close to 25,000, with a flood of newcomers from Lexington, 50 miles  south, and Cincinnati, 35 miles north. ''If we set the tone now for raising our children, we'll grow into that community,'' he said, of the importance of setting high standards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tucker, 35, insisted the issue  was a modern one of family values and nuisance-free neighborhoods, and not that of the old-fashioned pulpit-thumping denunciation of drink that once resounded in the area's hilltop churches.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Florek, denying that she is fronting for any business conglomerate, says the issue is one of convenience, not morality. She started her petition drive before the new moist option took effect on July 14.</p>
        <p>''Why should I have to drive 20 miles out of my way to Florence to buy a reasonably priced bottle of wine for dinner guests?'' she asked, contending that the nearest liquor stores in Kenton County, a wet oasis to the north, were not only fueling  Grant County's rate of drunken driving but price gouging as well.</p>
        <p>Intent to the last, Mrs. Florek worked this week on a 5- by 8-foot sign calling for residents to vote on Tuesday. She planned to put the sign  up across from the local Wal-Mart. All the while, she worried that the birth of her first child was four days overdue and that Tuesday might find her bedridden and unable to vote.</p>
        <p>''It took a lot of guts for her to do this,'' said her husband, Jeff, describing a low-key, six-month, one-woman petition drive. ''And, no, we're not naming the baby 'Jack Daniels' or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>A raft of elected officials and local business leaders are firmly opposed to going wet.</p>
        <p>''This is a very safe livable county, with almost no crime rate,'' said County Judge-Executive Darrell Link, predicting a dry victory, although perhaps by a smaller margin than the last such vote 15 years ago when wet forces were turned back by 2 to 1. Dry Ridge, he noted, is a name that predates Prohibition and was coined in the days of early railroading.</p>
        <p>''Life here is slow, it's wholesome, it's safe,'' Mr. Link said, emphasizing that this is a community of new housing developments sprouting in old farm fields, not of glasses clinking in the sort of new strip club that opponents point to over in Gallatin County.</p>
        <p>''I kind of put my head on the chopping block but it's worth it,'' declared Mrs. Florek, saying she simply grew fed up with the inconvenience and political passivity on the subject. ''People talk around here,'' she said, describing some rough and righteous letters she said she had received after her name surfaced in the advertisement that she said cost her $500.</p>
        <p>''It's time for truth,'' read the  headline on the ad, which noted that drunken driving rates were higher in Grant County than in three neighboring wet counties.</p>
        <p>For all of Mrs. Florek's stealth and industry, some will go to the polls on Tuesday convinced that a larger wet force has been at work in raising the issue. ''I think the business community is somehow behind this,'' said the Rev. Willie Ailstock of the Dry Ridge Baptist Church. ''And in a small town like this, nobody wants to be known as a troublemaker.''</p>
