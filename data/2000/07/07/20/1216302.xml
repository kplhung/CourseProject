        <p>THE temptation, watching the dust-up over an anti-Semitic slur that Hillary Rodham Clinton might or might not have hurled at a Baptist campaign worker 26 years ago in Arkansas (as reported in a book by a former reporter for The National Enquirer) is to say hey, what took so long?</p>
        <p>We refer not to 26 years but to the passage of months before the eruption of something distracting, improbable and usually ethnically sensitive in a New York campaign.</p>
        <p>Inevitable. Running for office in New York takes a good sense of the absurd. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan said when he first campaigned for the Senate in 1976, politics in New York is so complex it can cause ''cognitive dissonance.'' He said that in Brooklyn, where candidates quickly learn many a cultural intricacy. For instance, it's inappropriate for a male candidate to shake the hand of a Hasidic woman, but insulting for him not to shake the hand of a less observant Jewish woman.</p>
        <p>We digress.</p>
        <p>Back to the point, which is that this brouhaha has precedents, if imprecise ones because they involve remarks candidates made for sure.</p>
        <p>There was the Robert Abrams ''fascist'' remark in 1992 when he ran against the incumbent senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. After D'Amato supporters noisily heckled Mr. Abrams, the state attorney general, he told some students in Binghamton that Mr. D'Amato was ''a fascist.''</p>
        <p>The senator, so offended that he rushed to the television cameras, accused Mr. Abrams of insulting him with a slur. He demanded an apology (which took the annoyed Mr. Abrams several days to deliver), and even made a television ad featuring sepia-toned film of Benito Mussolini.</p>
        <p>''Our polls collapsed,'' Mr. Abrams's campaign director, Ethan Geto, recalled.  ''We were significantly ahead of D'Amato and within 48 hours, Abrams tanked. He made lot of mistakes. I made a lot of mistakes. It was not the greatest campaign. But the D'Amato people had the same polling. It was the saving grace for them.''</p>
        <p>Six years later, Mr. D'Amato gave a similar gift of offensive gab to his next opponent by labeling him with a Yiddish vulgarism at a private meeting, and denying he ever uttered the word until a television tape turned up. Oops.</p>
        <p>Senator Schumer said yesterday that his campaign polls were already showing him the victor, but he won by a larger margin than they predicted.</p>
        <p>It's not always an ethnic thing. When he ran for governor in 1982, Mayor Edward I. Koch patronized upstaters in an interview, saying that they drive 20 miles in a pickup truck to buy gingham dresses and Sears, Roebuck suits. He never recovered.</p>
        <p>A slip of the tongue tends to do the most damage if it reinforces the public's general impression of a candidate. Mr. D'Amato's Yiddish insult may have struck a chord because he had shown a crude streak before. ''It hit home,'' Mr. Schumer said.</p>
        <p>SO did the disparaging of upstate New York by a city mayor who used to say he got the bends beyond the five boroughs. And though Mr. Abrams, a lifelong liberal Democrat, was hardly anti-Italian, he could be self-righteous, a trait reinforced by his grudging apology.</p>
        <p>Anti-Semitism does not fit Mrs. Clinton's history and so this episode will not hurt her, Mr. Schumer predicted. Then again it may fit for some Jewish voters, unnerved by her hug of Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha, and Mrs. Clinton's remark in 1998 that she would favor creation of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>That position is in line with today's Israeli policies. But not with the politics of more conservative Jewish voters in New York, where a candidate has to be mindful about everything from upstate gingham to the foreign policy of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''New York is just more intense,'' said Mr. Schumer. ''When I walk through the Senate they are utterly amazed at New York politics. Every week when I come down on Tuesday, I go to a lunch with other senators and they say: 'Soooo, what's doing this week in New York? Tell us another one we can't believe.' ''</p>
        <p>Well, there's the one about a new book that accuses the first lady of sandwiching the word ''Jewish'' between two profanities in 1974 and lobbing them at a Baptist man who had a Jewish father (or maybe a great-grandmother) during a fight. And then when Mrs. Clinton was deep into the very tight race for United States Senate from New York, this guy with the Jewish father or maybe great-grandmother decided to unburden himself to a writer working on this new book about the ''complex marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton . . .''</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed. Cognitive dissonance.</p>
