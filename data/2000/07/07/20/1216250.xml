        <p>WITH daylong sun to stoke his fire and a coastal breeze to cool his jets, John McEnroe's decision to deploy himself as a Davis Cup doubles player remains a point in progress, a mental rally in which his brazen side is attempting to reach the net for a winning volley.</p>

        <p>WITH daylong sun to stoke his fire and a coastal breeze to cool his jets, John McEnroe's decision to deploy himself as a Davis Cup doubles player remains a point in progress, a mental rally in which his brazen side is attempting to reach the net for a winning volley.</p>
        <p>''Closer to 50-50, maybe a little more,'' McEnroe rated his chances yesterday of teaming with somebody, anybody, for Saturday's doubles against heavily favored Spain, smack dab in the middle of the Davis Cup semifinals in this beach-endowed resort city.</p>
        <p>For the third leg of his maiden voyage as skipper of the United States team, McEnroe finds himself in a typically tormented place, only without the enviable options to hit his way out. He has no Pete Sampras, no Andre Agassi and no fountain of youth from which to drink.</p>
        <p>This may not be The Perfect Storm that Captain McEnroe finds himself in. It could be worse, much less dramatic, a topspin torture under a broiling sun on thick, red clay. It could be death by indifference, with only Ma and Pa McEnroe, and maybe brother Patrick, caring enough to watch back home.</p>
        <p>From the American point of interest in sporting events playing out in Europe this week, this Davis Cup event can rate no better than third, behind the unparalleled golfer and the inspirational biker. McEnroe surely won't change that from a courtside chair and probably not from a doubles alley either.</p>
        <p>Yet it is against the man's nature to compete in anything less than a cacophonous state and, for the life of him, he hasn't been able to think of two better American doubles players or one good reason he absolutely should not put himself in.</p>
        <p>When McEnroe played four sets of doubles with three different partners Tuesday evening at the beachfront club alongside the temporary stadium that looks like a giant erector set, he won three and the other was called at five-all.</p>
        <p>Better yet, the practice drew fans away from the nearby Spaniards, a diverse crowd of sunbathers and celebrity worshipers who rabidly supported every angled winner off McEnroe's racquet.</p>
        <p>Even Juan Balcells, one of the Spanish doubles players, said it would be ''great, a thrill'' to play against the cranky legend. Never the most artful ambassador, McEnroe was unfortunately on record already regarding the quality of the likely doubles opposition.</p>
        <p>''To me, doubles are our best bet, on paper,'' he said. ''I'm not saying we'll do it but if we win the doubles and lose 4-1, I don't consider that a victory just because I stepped on the court and beat Balcells and, you know, somebody. I mean, who the hell is Balcells?''</p>
        <p>Whoever he is, Balcells and his probable partner, the rock-solid Alex Corretja, will be about 15 years younger and likely to make McEnroe miserable with those heavy ground strokes that are the foundation of the clay court game.</p>
        <p>When McEnroe looks in the mirror, he still sees the serve-and-volley genius, the short-point artist, more than the gray-haired 41-year-old who in his prime bragged about a conditioning program that began with his self-titled ''Haagen-Daz diet.''</p>
        <p>Of course, he would only have half the court to cover; points in doubles are shorter and the Spaniards are not going to serve and volley anyone off the court.</p>
        <p>Based on what he saw of McEnroe on Monday night, Todd Martin, the most experienced American singles player here, said: ''The only thing keeping him from being a real viable candidate to play is his second serve. His first serve is still very effective and his play at the net is superb. But you have to make your second serve penetrate on clay and I don't think that was easy for him even in his prime.''</p>
        <p>At Wimbledon, Martin said he did not think McEnroe should vacate his captain's chair but yesterday admitted that he had to ''hedge,'' now that Sampras and Agassi are injured and out, putting Martin in a position to play two singles matches.</p>
        <p>Martin is 30 and has fought off various ailments the last few years. To play doubles with Jan-Michael Gambill would mean three straight days in the sun, on the clay.</p>
        <p>McEnroe might have brought another doubles player, an Alex O'Brien, a Jared Palmer, but he played it straight in Zimbabwe and Los Angeles, resisted the temptation to nominate himself and lost the doubles in both events.</p>
        <p>McEnroe, with a career 18-2 record in the Davis Cup doubles, can't do any worse and there is nobody to make a case for who is certain to do better.</p>
        <p>When he assumed the captaincy, McEnroe's stated goal was to raise the visibility of the Davis Cup, which he has done to a degree. On the other hand, he already sounds frustrated by the bailouts of the stars and he knows that, with the possible exception of Gambill, there are none on the rise. He holds the job on a year-to-year basis, and said that he would have to assess his availability for next year.</p>
        <p>''This has not worked out the way I planned it but I still believe that Davis Cup is an event worth fighting for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He should take the fight to the court, one more time. He should put himself in, go to the net, strike a few winners for the sport that he loves. If he drowns under a tidal wave of topspin, well, disasters sell at the box office, too.</p>
