        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, took up the cause of the manufactured-housing industry in 1998, introducing a bill based on a proposal that its lobbyists provided that would change regulations, industry executives say. He has chaperoned the bill and subsequent versions, sometimes over the objections of groups worried that the changes would weaken consumer protections, and the House and Senate have approved versions of the measure.</p>

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, took up the cause of the manufactured-housing industry in 1998, introducing a bill based on a proposal that its lobbyists provided that would change regulations, industry executives say. He has chaperoned the bill and subsequent versions, sometimes over the objections of groups worried that the changes would weaken consumer protections, and the House and Senate have approved versions of the measure.</p>
        <p>All the while, Mr. Lazio has been pursuing the industry's donations.</p>
        <p>He has collected more than $95,000 from industry executives and political action committees, records show.</p>
        <p>But industry officials and Mr. Lazio's aides said donations from the industry were unrelated to his decision to champion the legislation. Mr. Lazio believes outmoded regulations have hampered the industry, preventing the creation of more inexpensive housing, aides said.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say that it has anything to do with the legislation,'' an industry official said of Mr. Lazio's fund-raising. ''He is not like that.''</p>
