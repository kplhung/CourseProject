        <p>Walk through Gov. George W. Bush's campaign headquarters here and you encounter a remarkable sight: virtually the same lineup of senior advisers that he had a year ago and, at the uppermost echelon of the operation, an inner circle of trusted friends that is wholly intact from the days when Mr. Bush won his first race for Texas governor in 1994.</p>
        <p>Listen to these advisers and you hear something equally arresting: unvarying, self-effacing odes to the governor's talents that attribute all credit for the campaign's successes to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Publicly acknowledged disagreements? Leaks? These are almost nonexistent in Bush world, because most of the people who are allowed to enter it have declared or demonstrated their loyalty, an ethos as precious to Mr. Bush as any other, the coin of his political realm.</p>
        <p>''Loyalty is the No. 1 criterion for him,'' said one Republican official who has known Mr. Bush for more than a decade. ''He would have loyalty over any other skill or characteristic in the people around him.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Bush, the de facto Republican presidential nominee, nears the announcement of his running mate, unanswered questions swirl around what type of political and professional pedigree that person will have. But Mr. Bush and his advisers have made clear that one of the litmus tests the person will have passed is that he or she can be utterly faithful to the governor.</p>
        <p>For this reason, most Republican operatives chalk up Senator John McCain of Arizona, a political maverick who loves the spotlight, as improbable, even if his publicly stated lack of interest could be overcome and even though his presence on the ticket could be a powerful lure for independent and swing voters.</p>
        <p>Conversely, Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has maintained his position as one of the most-talked-about contenders largely because his mild manner and long friendship with Mr. Bush suggest that he would never try to contradict, usurp or eclipse the Texas governor, Republican officials said.</p>
        <p>Even by the standards of politics, where discretion is always desired, Mr. Bush places an extremely high premium on loyalty, and it drives his important decisions -- helping to determine who gets his ear, who gets the top jobs around him and the terms of their relationships with him. Many of the senior people affiliated with his campaign had proven their commitment to him by forswearing other political allegiances or taking low salaries. Others had long histories with the Bush family.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Bush's request, his chief strategist, Karl Rove, sold his consulting business so that his attention to the candidate would be undivided. Maverick Media, the advertising firm that produces Mr. Bush's television commercials, was brought into existence solely for the purpose of the Bush campaign and has no clients other than Mr. Bush, an unusual arrangement in presidential politics.</p>
        <p>In an interview aboard his campaign plane on Tuesday, Mr. Bush said that what he had tried to do was build an efficient team, and that loyalty was its glue, binding people together so that they could focus on common goals without fear that colleagues would work against their interests.</p>
        <p>''A disloyal person in the wrong position can undermine an administration,'' said Mr. Bush, seemingly alluding to the lessons that his friends and advisers said he learned from watching his father, former President George Bush, prevail when the lieutenants around him were true and struggle when they were not.</p>
        <p>But several political analysts said that there was a potential downside to Mr. Bush's penchant for loyalists. One Republican strategist questioned whether Mr. Bush received advice that was tough and critical enough and whether he exposed himself to a wide enough range of opinions.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen a single decision made by this campaign that looked to me like they had to force the candidate to do it,'' said the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''That's not necessarily a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Another Republican official, describing Mr. Bush's closest advisers, observed: ''I've never seen a campaign where people don't sit around and psychoanalyze the guy. They never do that, even if you're having a drink with them. They never call him anything other than governor, and they never say anything even remotely close to disparaging.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers say that their united public front should never be mistaken for a private acquiescence to his wants and whims.</p>
        <p>''I feel absolutely free to disagree with him,'' said Karen P. Hughes, the campaign's director of communications. Other advisers said that they, too, spoke their minds around Mr. Bush, but that the vigorous debates behind closed doors stayed there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes and other advisers said that Mr. Bush had earned their loyalty, supporting them as strongly as they support him.</p>
        <p>''When we lost New Hampshire by 20 points,'' Ms. Hughes said, referring to the Republican primary, ''the easy thing for him to do, to silence the critics, would have been to give them a sacrificial lamb. He didn't do that. He said, 'We're in this together.' ''</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane recently, Mr. Bush said, ''There was never any question in my mind'' about changing his team. ''These are friends,'' he said. ''I know they're there for the right reason.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush struggled in the primaries to turn back the insurgency of Mr. McCain, some analysts speculated that he would turn to a conventionally seasoned political operative to supplement the so-called iron triangle -- Mr. Rove, Ms. Hughes and Joe Allbaugh, the campaign manager -- who had also guided Mr. Bush's career in Texas.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Bush asked one of his best and oldest friends, Donald L. Evans, an oil and gas company executive, to be the campaign chairman.</p>
        <p>The tightness and endurance of Mr. Bush's advisers stand in contrast to the gyrations in Vice President Al Gore's operation, which Mr. Bush has monitored with a disapproving eye. During a taping of the television news program ''Hardball with Chris Matthews'' a month and a half ago, Mr. Bush predicted that Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, would not survive Mr. Gore's persistent disadvantage in most polls.</p>
        <p>''They're going to dump him,'' Mr. Bush told Mr. Matthews during a commercial break. ''Mark my words. Oh, they'll dump him. There's no loyalty in those guys.'' (Mr. Coelho later stepped down after being hospitalized with an inflamed colon.)</p>
        <p>The unity of the Bush team differs as well from the revolving door that afflicted Bob Dole's presidential campaign four years ago, and it has enabled Mr. Bush to keep the news coverage of his campaign focused on the policies he is unveiling or the voters he is courting.</p>
        <p>It also reflects Mr. Bush's lingering ire over the behavior of some aides and allies during  former President Bush's failed re-election effort. Mr. Bush said that when the going got tough, ''I saw them jumping out the windows in 1992, looking for the next campaign. And that influenced me. Yeah, that influenced me.''</p>
        <p>Friends said that Mr. Bush also learned to value loyalty from the example of his father, who swallowed ideological differences with Ronald Reagan to serve as his vice president from 1981 to 1989. After his father was elected to the presidency in 1988, George W. Bush was asked to head a committee with the task of making sure that people who had helped his father win were not overlooked for jobs.</p>
        <p>''George W. opened the meeting by saying, 'The purpose of this occasion is not to punish our enemies but to identify our friends','' recalled Chase Untermeyer, who became the director of personnel in the White House.</p>
        <p>And friends are not being forgotten -- or forgetting the Bushes. Condoleezza Rice, a Russia specialist on the National Security Council under President Bush, is his son's chief foreign policy adviser. Richard B. Cheney, the defense secretary during the Bush administration, is supervising the process by which the Texas governor selects a vice president.</p>
        <p>And when the governor discusses these teammates, the words loyal or loyalty are bound to pop up, as they do even when he talks about the less political people in his life.</p>
        <p>During a recent interview about his wife, Laura, Mr. Bush said: ''The other thing about Laura is that she's fiercely loyal. She's loyal to me. She's loyal to my dad. She's loyal to her children.'' It was clear, in the tone of his voice, that there was no praise any higher.</p>
