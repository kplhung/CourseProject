        <p>The speaker hanging on a pole has been replaced by an FM broadcast for the dialogue and soundtrack, but drive-in movie theaters still have huge screens, concession stands and children in pajamas in the back of the car.</p>
        <p>Fans can find a state-by-state list of drive-ins at the Drive-In Theater Web site (www  .driveintheater.com). Some listings -- like that of the Transit Drive-In in Lockport, N.Y., run by the Cohen family for three generations -- include their own history, pictures and a current film schedule.</p>
        <p>The site also has a history of drive-ins since the first one opened in 1933, a sampling of animated intermission advertisements (with juggling popcorn and talking hot dogs) and links.</p>
