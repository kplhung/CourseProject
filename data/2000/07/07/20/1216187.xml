        <p>IMITATION straw rugs for the kitchen and beautiful pebbles for the shower are just two new stylishly textured options that can perk up a floor. Even when materials are not natural, the effect always is.</p>
        <p>1. Indoor-outdoor Quartzstone tiles are 90 percent quartz and 10 percent cement, without any chemicals or resins. The highly polished version resembles terrazzo; honed, it resembles granite; sandblasted, it looks like flagstone. Tiles can be grouted, or installed with the metal strips used on terrazzo floors. They come in 16 colors and three sizes -- 12-inch squares (half an inch thick); 16-inch squares (seven-eighths of an inch) and 24-inch squares (seven-eighths of an inch). At $7 to $9 a square foot, they're much less expensive than stone. Sold at Tiles -- A Refined Selection, 227 East 59th Street or 42 West 15th Street. 2. Rock Island Pebbles are mounted on mesh like mosaic tiles and come in white, pink, aqua (shown), gray, speckled, tan and black. Each 12-inch or 16-inch mesh square has handpicked stones that are comfortable to walk on indoors or out. Stones come in thicknesses from five- to nine-sixteenths of an inch; $16 a square foot at Alan Court &amp; Associates, 34 Park Place, East Hampton, N.Y. (631) 324-7497. 3. Natural Lonwood vinyl flooring looks like large sheets of wood. The six-foot-wide rolls come in eight colors; $5 a square foot. Store locations from Lonseal, www.lonseal.com, or (800) 832-7111. 4. Italian marble tiles, designed by Kevin Walz, have inlaid bronze and resin shavings that make patterns -- crosses (shown), dots and arcs. The 18-inch squares are only three-eighths of an inch thick; $15 a square foot at ExInc, 155 East 56th Street. 5. The Verso carpet, from Finland, is woven of birch slats with linen, in four color combinations. A six-by-nine-foot rug is $3,080, a five-by-seven is $2,030, at ICF, 920 Broadway (22nd Street). Since they have no pile, they may be ideal for those with allergies. 6. RugMats, also without pile, look like straw but are woven vinyl with rubberized backs, in three textures and six colors: aluminum, bronze, silver, straw, bark and stone. A 2-by-3-foot mat is $90, a 4 1/2-by-6-foot rug is $260; a 2-by-9-foot runner is $220. Available next month at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>
