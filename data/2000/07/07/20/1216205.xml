        <p>MARIO BUATTA was watching the new CBS show ''Big Brother'' the other night, and he did not like what he saw. As a decorator to New York's moneyed classes, Mr. Buatta is not usually squeamish about Darwinian social experiments. But even so, he found himself discomfited by the show, which throws 10 strangers into a house for three months and records their every move. Mr. Buatta, like many viewers, was troubled by the show's intrusive peeping. But more than that, he had decor issues. ''It suffers from a lack of chintz,'' he said, getting right down to cases. ''It's like watching animals in an experiment. Chintz would help.''</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' which made its debut on July 5, has been a tenuous hit among viewers, starting strong and then fluttering in the ratings. Some fault the odious cast members, some the paint-drying pace. But for the heavies of the home business, the real problem lies elsewhere. In a word, it's the house, a 1,800-square-foot box built on a studio lot in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The first time she saw the show, the interior designer Victoria Hagan said, she felt she had descended to the fifth circle of decor hell. ''I was just struck by how cruel it was to make people live in this house,'' she said. ''It looks like Pee-Wee's Frat House. It seems psychologically so damaging.''</p>
        <p>The house, created by a team of Dutch set designers and Sony engineers, is less a home than a prefab collision of loud colors and electronic surveillance gear. ''It's supposed to be a back-to-basics house,'' the executive producer Paul Romer said. ''Comfortable, but without luxury. It's designed to make the possibilities for group interactions as high as possible.'' Equipped with 28 cameras, 60 microphones, two bedrooms and only one bathroom, and filled with candy-colored dishes and furnishings, it is a biosphere of cartoon taste.</p>
        <p>Instead of mimicking the stagey domesticity of shows like ''The View,'' the producers designed a dwelling with no human points of reference: no crammed bookshelves, no art, no furnishings that suggest a historical context beyond last week. The house conjures what the social critic George W. S. Trow, writing of post-TV American pop culture, called the context of no context, a media universe with no bearings outside itself.</p>
        <p>''What they did is let the people become the featured tchotchkes,'' said Lee F. Mindel, of the New York design firm Shelton, Mindel &amp; Associates. ''But unfortunately the backdrops are more colorful than characters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer, the executive producer, admitted that he would not want to live in the house. ''It's a little too basic for me,'' he said. ''I'm a Dutch guy, and the word 'cozy' means a lot in Holland.''</p>
        <p>For the five men and five women living in the house, as for the millions viewing at home, this is what the world comes down to. They cannot see beyond the garden wall, and have no contact with outside society, aside from the disembodied voice of Big Brother. Every two weeks, the TV audience votes one member out of the house, until only the winner is left; the first loser gets the bad news tonight. Mr. Buatta allowed that such a proposition might not go over well among his well-heeled clients, even if the network did lay on the chintz.  ''They'd either eat or drink or smoke each other out of the place,'' he said. And worse, he added, ''there's no golf course.''</p>
        <p>They would also have to contend with the house's color scheme, a kind of Ikea of the ethers: yellow walls meet blue tiles to frame blood-red couches and white-pine bunk beds. The effect is intended to be soothing, Mr. Romer explained. ''The yellow colors are there to make them feel more comfortable,'' he said. ''We deliberately made the small room this dark red to make them feel comfortable so they'd open up about their emotions.''</p>
        <p>The house, like the show, was originally created for Dutch television, where it was a runaway success. Mr. Romer said the designers had done some tinkering as they recreated it in Germany, Spain and now here. For American audiences -- and perhaps to reconfirm European estimates of American taste -- the producers added a ribbon of screaming purple wainscoting and more yellow surfaces. ''Purple wainscoting,'' Ms. Hagan harrumphed, rising to the challenge. ''I find it unsettling.''</p>
        <p>She is not alone. The ''Big Brother'' Web site, which offers 24/7 surveillance into the house, hints at potential chromatic troublemaking to come. Yellow, the site imparts, ''can be inappropriate and confusing in the living room.'' Tucker Viemeister, of the hip design firm Razorfish, saw the color palette as ripe with potential, most of it sinister. ''I like the bold colors,'' he said, ''but I also think it's set up to cause friction as opposed to comfort, in the same way they paint the insides of fast-food restaurants orange to make people leave fast. The color combinations are cartoony as opposed to relaxing. You think a big stick of dynamite is going to show up any minute now.''</p>
        <p>For David Rockwell, who designed colorful, theme-ish environments at restaurants like Nobu and Ruby Foo's, these tensions are not inevitable. Given the chance, he said, he'd allow in more natural light and vary the textures of the surfaces to create different moods for socializing. ''People should be lit in ways that don't make them look so horrible,'' he said. ''Yellow paint, gray carpet, blue tiles -- no one looks good against that.'' Beyond that, he'd set the cast to work on art projects.</p>
        <p>But such stress relievers miss the point. The role of the house is to foster dramatic conflict, not to sap it. In this suburban update of ''Lord of the Flies,'' it is not humankind's nature, but its design choices that point the way to atavism and destruction. Though the show plays loosey-goosey with reality, in this respect at least it is right on the money. As any homeowner knows, this is the way the world ends: not with a bang but a bad paint sample.</p>
