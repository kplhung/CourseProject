        <p>''Des Canyons aux Etoiles . . .'' is Messiaen's specifically American piece. Its putative subject is Bryce Canyon in Utah, but this 12-part, richly populated instrumental work was commissioned to be played at Lincoln Center, surrounded by the skyscrapers he detested.

        <p>''Des Canyons aux Etoiles . . .'' is Messiaen's specifically American piece. Its putative subject is Bryce Canyon in Utah, but this 12-part, richly populated instrumental work was commissioned to be played at Lincoln Center, surrounded by the skyscrapers he detested. Its first performance was in 1974, as a musical prelude to the Bicentennial. It was successfully resurrected a year ago and appeared again at Avery Fisher Hall on Tuesday night, put on by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center before a large and enthusiastic audience.</p>
        <p>The title translates, ''From the Canyons to the Stars,'' and indeed worship of nature was a form of transportation, bearing the composer and the listener to more altitudinous contemplations of God. Messiaen's personally invented version of Roman Catholicism (by which he was presiding priest and a congregation of one) expresses a kind of dazed fervor that for even the slightly skeptical borders on the zany.</p>
        <p>Yet the transfers of geological phenomena, shapes, colors and especially bird song from one set of senses to another remain unapologetic and unequivocal. Listen to my music, his elaborate program descriptions imply, and you will hear the sights of rock formations, the smells of fir and birch, the feel of strong winds on the face and desert sand between the toes.</p>
        <p>Translations like these, along with the fanciful syntheses of birdcalls, require faith on the listener's part, but then faith is Messiaen's stock in trade. Abandoned necessarily are old connections of music and landscape: Beethoven in the woods or Liszt in the Alps. Messiaen's sound world, for all its aspirations toward God's creations in their natural state, belongs paradoxically to a man-made environment. The woodwind combinations have an industrial shrillness. The wind machine sounds endearingly fake. The instrumental colors, whether they represent rock faces or the cries of red-shafted flickers, are acrylic in their brightness.</p>
        <p>Paradox is indeed at work in ''Des Canyons.'' For Messiaen's music is both unforgiving (with brutal, assaultive chord clusters) and at the same time quite ready to draw listeners to redemptive, triumphant conclusions with simple major triads. The new stands beside the nostalgic. The final movement, ''Zion Park et la Cite Celeste,'' sums up with a near-traditional chorale, decorating it however by bird song wholly oblivious to European music. What truly set this composer apart from the 20th century was his view of consonance not as the one God or the anti-Christ, but as an important member of a larger pantheon.</p>
        <p>Messiaen's birds are freely translated. The real white-browed robin and blue grouse are a world apart from orchestra instruments or tempered tuning systems. What we have are slow-motion approximations, capturing the basic shapes of rhythm and interval of various calls but bearing as much resemblance to their originals as a Cubist depiction of a photographed nude. Messiaen's birds don't fly, and they sing only in the composer's voice.</p>
        <p>Reinbert de Leeuw conducted an orchestra of about 45. The distribution of instruments is fairly traditional, but with piccolo trumpet and bass trombone to explore extremes, and bells, gongs and tam-tams to variegate the sound. Such exoticisms as the xylorimba (Richard Fitz) and glockenspiel (Jeffrey Milarsky) are introduced along with the sounds of shifting sand.</p>
        <p>There are more elaborate solo parts for piano and for horn. Peter Serkin took the first with wonderful concentration and skill in music that is extremely difficult. William Purvis played the elaborate and exposed horn passages with fortitude and considerable subtlety.</p>
        <p>Fisher Hall was not filled, but then this is a space inappropriately big for a Lincoln Center Festival 2000 event like this one.</p>
        <p>If seats to the rear were empty, the sounds of enthusiasm at the end, a lot of them from young people, indicated that in the generation succeeding him Messiaen has found friends.</p>
