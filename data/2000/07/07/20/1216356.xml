        <p>More than 20 percent of the new single-family homes sold annually in the United States are made in factories and installed on site, ready-to-live-in realty born of assembly-line technology. This industry is governed by an obscure series of regulations that its lobbyists have long pressed Congress to overhaul. Now, the industry is close to its goal, in large part because of Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York, took up the industry's cause in 1998, introducing a bill based on a proposal that the lobbyists provided, industry executives say. He has chaperoned the bill and subsequent versions since then, sometimes over the objections of groups worried that the changes would weaken consumer protections, and the House and Senate have approved versions of the measure, with a compromise likely.</p>
        <p>All the while, Mr. Lazio has been pursuing the industry's donations.</p>
        <p>He has collected more than $95,000 from industry executives and political action committees, campaign records show. He began receiving  this money in 1995, soon after he let it be known that he was considering sponsoring the bill, which would revamp construction and safety standards for manufactured housing. He has collected most of the donations since introducing the measure.</p>
        <p>Executives at manufactured-housing companies across the nation have responded to his entreaties, from Spirit Homes of Conway, Ark., to Chateau Communities of Elizabeth, Colo., and Homes of Merit of Lake City, Fla. Mr. Lazio has raised $12,550 alone from companies in Indiana, a center of the industry.</p>
        <p>''He has been very aggressive and has had a lot of fund-raisers,'' said Danny Ghorbani, president of a trade group promoting the legislation, the Manufactured Housing Association for Regulatory Reform, which notes that its factories have become increasingly sophisticated, churning out homes that are sometimes indistinguishable from those built from the ground up. ''You cannot compare Mr. Lazio to the average congressman,'' Mr. Ghorbani said. ''Everybody involved with Congress has probably been tapped for these aggressive fund-raisers by Mr. Lazio.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghorbani added: ''I wouldn't say that it has anything to do with the legislation. He is not like that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said the donations from the industry were unrelated to his decision to champion the legislation. Mr. Lazio believes that outmoded regulations have hampered the industry, preventing the creation of more inexpensive housing, the aides said.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is that Rick was fighting for affordable housing, and manufactured homes are more affordable in many instances than built homes,'' said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Lazio campaign. ''Many first homes and homes for senior citizens are frequently manufactured homes. This is serving populations that often times find it difficult to afford housing.''</p>
        <p>It is perfectly legal to collect money from donors with legislative interests, as long as there is no explicit promise of official action for contributions.</p>
        <p>The contributions from the manufactured-housing industry help illustrate why Mr. Lazio has been one of the most successful fund-raisers in Congress: he has excelled at harvesting money from donors with legislation before him, particularly those involved in housing issues, according to an examination of his campaign records. Mr. Lazio is well positioned to do so. He is the only member to serve on the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee, both of which are fertile ground for fund-raising as they oversee many wealthy industries. More important, he is chairman of the housing subcommittee, so builders, real estate agents, mortgage lenders and other housing interests often need his assent to get bills passed.</p>
        <p>Having raised so much money from these donors, Mr. Lazio is turning to them again because he is under considerable pressure to collect money for his Senate campaign, given his late start in the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton. In fact, soon after becoming a candidate, Mr. Lazio named Lewis S. Ranieri, a pioneer in the mortgage finance field who is one of his biggest contributors, as his finance chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio declined to be interviewed for this article.</p>
        <p>He is by no means alone in raising money from donors with interests before him, though most members of Congress have generally not been as successful. As of March, before he entered the Senate race, Mr. Lazio had $3.5 million in his campaign account, more money than any other House member.</p>
        <p>''Rick has been successful raising money from individuals across the board,'' said Mr. McLagan, the Lazio campaign spokesman. ''He is a housing chairman who actually understands the issues, and has a well-documented passion for affordable housing. The people who share that goal and share that passion support him. That's democracy.''</p>
        <p>Contributions from housing interests have not just flowed to Mr. Lazio's official campaign committee. A PAC that he set up in 1995 in New York has also benefited.</p>
        <p>For example, in 1998, Mr. Lazio waged a fierce battle to defeat a bill to expand a federal program that helps first-time home buyers secure mortgages. The bill would have raised the limit on the size of mortgages that the Federal Housing Administration guarantees by 33 percent to 163 percent, depending on the geographic area. The bill was opposed by private mortgage insurance companies, which said that the federal government was taking business away from them by enlarging the program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, chairman of the Banking Committee, wrote a letter to the speaker at the time, Newt Gingrich, saying that the bill would ''move us toward a socialization of the financial mortgage markets'' and represented ''perhaps one of the greatest government expansions and intrusions into the private sector since the Republicans have been in the majority.''</p>
        <p>Some Democrats said at the time that they were puzzled by Mr. Lazio's opposition, noting that the increase was intended to make it easier for people to get F.H.A. loans in expensive areas, including his district on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, allied with some other Republicans, was able to scale back the proposal before it passed in October 1998. The loan limit increased by 16 percent to 26 percent.</p>
        <p>Less than a month later, on Nov. 2, just before Election Day, Mr. Lazio's New York committee, Friends of Rick Lazio, received a total of $23,500 from six of the largest private mortgage insurance companies. The industry trade group, the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, coordinated the donations. ''Our contribution to him was our way of supporting him in all the important work that he is doing that directly affects our industry,'' said Glen Corso, a spokesman for one of the companies, PMI Mortgage Insurance Company, which donated $5,000.</p>
        <p>Asked whether there was a connection between the donations and the fight over the loan limit, Mr. McLagan said, ''No, of course not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has also collected sizable contributions from donors with interests before the Commerce Committee, particularly Wall Street and the broadcasting industry. Since joining the committee in 1997, he has raised more than $50,000 from executives and PAC's connected to Citigroup, the financial services conglomerate that lobbied heavily on legislation to modernize the industry, and more than $43,000 from executives and PAC's at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>But at the heart of his fund-raising success has been the housing industry.</p>
        <p>Take manufactured housing. For years, the industry has agitated about a 1974 federal law that establishes construction and safety standards. Company executives point out that the industry largely built mobile homes back then, but these days their products are far more advanced. ''The law was originally written for trailers and mobile homes,'' said Edward J. Hussey, an industry executive who is vice president of Liberty Homes in Goshen, Ind., and has given Mr. Lazio $5,000 since 1996. ''We are now building homes that go on foundations and look like any other house. We are dealing not only with different building materials, but different products.''</p>
        <p>Interest groups on all sides of the issue agree that the law is obsolete, but consumer groups repeatedly complained that the industry was trying to push through new regulations that would water down consumer protections and essentially allow the industry to regulate itself.</p>
        <p>In 1998, after being determinedly lobbied by the industry since the Republicans gained control of Congress three years earlier, Mr. Lazio introduced his bill, and one of the most influential groups involved in the issue, AARP, which represents older Americans, said the bill was unacceptable. Roy Green, an AARP lobbyist, said the bill would have established a committee to make  regulations that would be dominated by industry. The bill would have also scaled back the Department of Housing and Urban Development's oversight of the industry.</p>
        <p>Around this time, donations from the industry were pouring in to Mr. Lazio's campaign. In June 1998, Mr. Lazio collected nearly $13,000 from executives of manufactured-housing companies.</p>
        <p>After negotiations with some Democratic lawmakers, AARP and other  groups, Mr. Lazio agreed to modify the legislation, reducing the industry's ability to control the rule-making committee. The 1998 bill passed the House, only to stall in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio introduced the legislation again in February 1999, and it underwent further changes in talks with opponents. In February and March 1999, Mr. Lazio raised a total of nearly $22,000 from the industry.</p>
        <p>In later negotiations, Mr. Lazio agreed to establish a process to allow consumers to settle disputes with the manufacturers or the companies that installed the housing. He wrapped the legislation into a larger housing bill, and it has now passed the House. The Senate approved a slightly different bill.</p>
        <p>Several opponents of the original Lazio legislation favor the changes in the House version, and no longer are fighting the measure.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan said the original legislation had been fair to both the industry and consumers, explaining that Mr. Lazio believed that H.U.D. had not supervised the industry properly. Housing agency officials disputed that criticism, saying Mr. Lazio was making the department a scapegoat.</p>
        <p>As for the donations, Mr. Hussey said they had not helped the industry obtain special treatment. ''He is a very bright young man and works very, very hard at what he does,'' Mr. Hussey said of Mr. Lazio. ''I think that he is a rising star, and that is why people are contributing.''</p>
