        <p>Re ''Building a Better Web With Content Blueprints'' (July 13): Colin Furness's description of the distinctions between graphic designers and so-called ''information architects'' is a bit simplistic, although he is not alone in his lack of knowledge concerning graphic design.</p>

        <p>Re ''Building a Better Web With Content Blueprints'' (July 13): Colin Furness's description of the distinctions between graphic designers and so-called ''information architects'' is a bit simplistic, although he is not alone in his lack of knowledge concerning graphic design.</p>
        <p>While I do admit that there are many ''graphics designers'' who, as Mr. Furness says, simply ''decide what the window will look like,'' that does not adequately represent the contribution of many educated professional graphic designers.</p>
        <p>Both the visual characteristics and structure of content must be simultaneously considered. Graphic designers, or at least the ones I know, understand the principles of syntax and semantics that users depend for a consistent visual language.</p>
