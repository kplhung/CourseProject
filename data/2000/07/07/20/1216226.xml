        <p>Re ''Housing Crisis Confounds a Prosperous City'' (news article, July 9):</p>
        <p>Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's direction, the New York City Housing Development Corporation has made direct investments of more than $1 billion that have produced 11,000 units of housing at more than 150 sites throughout the city. In addition, for the first time in more than 30 years, the city has a nationally recognized, middle-income housing program, the New Housing Opportunities Program. This program alone has generated more than 2,000 units of affordable middle-income housing since its inception just over two years ago.</p>

        <p>Providing the financing for those homes is the challenge for this agency. It is unfortunate that you made no mention of the mayor's or H.D.C.'s role in the city's housing market.</p>
