        <p>WHEN Matthew Bregman, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's development director, initiated a marketing plan to spur neighborhood real estate development for use by the performing arts, he searched for a way to project accurate images of the borough's landmarks, potential sources of financing and residential areas lacking access to the arts.

        <p>Presenting the project to BAM's board without visual aids would have been ineffective, Mr. Bregman said. ''It's kind of like if you tried to play chess without a chess board,'' he said. ''The visual difference is extraordinary.''</p>

        <p>WHEN Matthew Bregman, the Brooklyn Academy of Music's development director, initiated a marketing plan to spur neighborhood real estate development for use by the performing arts, he searched for a way to project accurate images of the borough's landmarks, potential sources of financing and residential areas lacking access to the arts. He found the solution in the New York Public Interest Research Group's computer mapping software.</p>
        <p>Presenting the project to BAM's board without visual aids would have been ineffective, Mr. Bregman said. ''It's kind of like if you tried to play chess without a chess board,'' he said. ''The visual difference is extraordinary.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, the research group, known as Nypirg, began the Community Mapping Assistance Project (www.cmap.nypirg.org) to provide customized computer mapping services to nonprofit groups like the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Web-based program generates detailed maps using sophisticated Geographic Information Systems software. Since the project's inception, Nypirg has been engaged in more than 250 projects for almost 100 nonprofit clients.</p>
        <p>Although many federal government agencies and for-profit corporations regularly use Geographic Information Systems software to present statistical data visually, nonprofit organizations do not often rely on the costly software mapping programs because those groups lack the financial and highly specialized technology personnel resources, Steve Romalewski, CMAP's technology director, said. Nypirg's service fills this need by providing the technology that can plot an organization's data and provides computer-generated maps, graphs and reports tailored to the needs of New York State's nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>''These maps are not just a convenience,'' Mr. Bregman said. ''It's a necessity to have this technology.''</p>
        <p>Nonprofit organizations use the G.I.S. mapping technology primarily to facilitate their advocacy work. The United Hospital Fund of New York, for example, uses the technology on its Web site to display the locations of ambulatory care sites, hospitals and nursing homes (www.uhfnyc.org). By entering a ZIP code, people can find phone numbers and other information to get the help they need, said plained Amy Cohen, the United Hospital Fund's technology editor.</p>
        <p>''People want to return to our site when they see how easy it is to find these locations for their elderly family members,'' Ms. Cohen said, ''and it's easily accessibly for volunteers who want to help out in local centers.'' The Web site receives 400 to 500 hits per month.</p>
        <p>CMAP also serves as a political tool for nonprofits lobbying for increased political or financial support by creating digital images of an organization's membership, demographic patterns and legislative districts.  Interactive sites that use the CMAP technology include Who Represents Me? New York City residents can enter their address to find representatives at the federal, state and city levels.</p>
        <p>''The Council Finder is extraordinarily helpful. Lobbyists in the nonprofit community could spend two hours just to locate the right people to contact and to find out who your representative is,'' Mr. Bregman said.</p>
        <p>Converting data from a raw statistical database into a visual image makes it easier for nonprofit groups to find sources of financing. The mapping software also helps advocacy groups mobilize public opinion. Arnold Cohen, president of the Partnership for the Homeless, a nonprofit that operates  homeless shelters in New York City, uses maps on the organization's Web site to show lobbyists which representatives to focus on  to increase New York City's financing of homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>''On a detailed map, we can see our network of 140 shelters sprinkled throughout the boroughs,'' Mr. Cohen said, ''which makes us more informed when we speak to congressional or City Council representatives. We also see where there are gaps in our network so we can push for more funding.''</p>
        <p>On its own Web site, CMAP creates maps that draw on its databases of research stored during the past 10 years from Nypirg's environmental and consumer projects. Once the figures are converted to digital form, nonprofit organizations can translate the numbers into vivid visual displays that increase public awareness. The visual images of demographic and income patterns retrieved from 1990 census data enable some organizations to examine the locations of social service centers. Similarly, a Top 21 Dirty Power Plants in NY link on CMAP's Web site draws users from Nypirg's environmental research projects to a map with the location of power plants and emission reports for each plant.</p>
