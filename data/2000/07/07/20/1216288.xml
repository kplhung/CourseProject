        <p>House, by surprising 401-25 margin, approves bill to spur retirement savings by raising amount workers can contribute to 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred retirmement plans and making it easier to transfer savings in employer-sponsored plans from job to job; bill, which would cost $52.2 billion over 10 years, would raise maximum contributions to IRA's and Roth IRA's to $5,000, in phases, by 2003, with workers over 50 allowed to make $5,000 contribution beginning in 2001; maximum contribution to 401(k) would rise to $15,000 (M)</p>

        <p>By a surprisingly lopsided margin, the House voted today to strengthen retirement savings plans by permitting workers to make larger contributions to them and making it easier to transfer savings in employer-sponsored plans from job to job.</p>
        <p>The legislation, passed by 401 to 25, is intended to encourage Americans to save more for retirement. Many Democrats objected to it, saying it would benefit high-income employees but do little to help low-income workers. Still, just 24 Democrats voted against the measure, an indication of its broad appeal to voters.</p>
        <p>The bill's future appears uncertain, though. For one thing, it is unclear whether the Senate will have time to take it up before the end of the current Congress. And the Clinton administration, sharing the concerns of House Democrats, strongly opposes it. The administration instead wants legislation that would  help those of more modest income -- many of whom are among the 75 million Americans not covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans -- rather than those financially able to make contributions above the current limits.</p>
        <p>Sponsors of the House bill, which has the strong backing of some trade unions, said they hoped its resounding approval today would better its chances both in the Senate and at the White House. ''Frankly I didn't expect such a strong vote,'' said Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who co-sponsored the bill with Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland.  ''That was an extraordinary vote of confidence. A strong message is being sent to the Senate and the president that this House is committed, on a bipartisan basis, to provide more retirement security this year.''</p>
        <p>The legislation, whose cost to the government is estimated at $52.2 billion over 10 years, would raise the amount of money that workers can contribute to 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred retirement plans.</p>
        <p>Under current law, workers can set aside no more than $2,000 a year in individual retirement accounts. That amount, applying to both the traditional I.R.A. and the newer Roth I.R.A., would rise to $5,000, in phases, by 2003. An exception would be made for those older than 50, who would be permitted to make a $5,000 contribution beginning next year. The exception is meant as a catch-up tool for older workers who may not have saved enough for retirement.</p>
        <p>In 401(k) plans, which permit workers to set aside savings from their pay and allow employers to take tax deductions for adding to those amounts, the annual limit on tax-deferred employee contributions would rise in phases to $15,000 by 2005, from the current maximum of $10,500. Again an exception would be made for those over 50, who would be permitted to save an extra $5,000 a year. And employers could contribute as much as 20 percent of a worker's salary, up from 15 percent.</p>
        <p>In an era of frequent job-hopping, the legislation would also make it easier for workers to transfer their savings in employer-sponsored plans  from one job to the next. One provision, for example, would speed employees' ability to become fully vested in 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>In addition, the bill would address a longtime concern of carpenters, plumbers and other trade workers, whose wages often fluctuate from year to year, leaving many with less in pension benefits than they would otherwise receive. Under a 1974 law, multiple-employer pension plans for trade workers calculate benefits on the basis of the three consecutive years of highest pay; the bill would change the basis to the three highest-paid years, regardless of whether consecutive.</p>
        <p>Underlying the broader legislation are a desire to spur an American savings rate that is now at Depression-era lows, and lawmakers' concern that more needs to be done to supplement Social Security benefits,  particularly since only half of all workers in the private sector have pensions. ''While we must save Social Security, we must remember that Social Security was never intended to meet all the financial needs of retirement,'' Mr. Cardin said. ''Employees need to understand that they need to take greater responsibility in saving for retirement.''</p>
        <p>But other Democrats, even those who support some aspects of the bill, complained during the debate that it should do more to help low- and moderate-income workers. They are the ones who have the hardest time setting money aside for the future, Democrats said. As it is, few workers with I.R.A.'s and 401(k)'s save the maximum permitted by law, a point Democrats used to illustrate that the bill favored the affluent.</p>
        <p>Addressing that concern, Democrats offered an amendment, based on a White House initiative, to provide tax credits to workers of modest income. For every $2,000 those workers saved, the government would match it with $1,000. That proposal was rejected today on a vote of 221 to 200.</p>
