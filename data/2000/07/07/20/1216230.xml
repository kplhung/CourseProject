        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Lawmakers Seek Way to Note Slaves' Role in Building Capitol'' (news article, July 13):</p>
        <p>Slave labor was used not only in the construction of the United States Capitol, but in its decoration as well.</p>
        <p>Atop the building's dome stands a Statue of Freedom, designed by Thomas Crawford (1813-1857) as a figure of Liberty wearing her traditional Phrygian cap. However, a member of the committee in charge of decoration of the Capitol, Jefferson Davis (later to become president of the Confederate States of America), objected on the basis of the cap's association with emancipation from slavery.</p>
        <p>Crawford revised his sculpture, substituted a helmet with stars and a cockade of feathers, and the final version was inaugurated on Dec. 2, 1863, with Abraham Lincoln presiding.</p>
        <p>This Statue of Freedom was cast under the direction of a slave, Philip Reed, in Chester Hill's foundry in Maryland. This account is highlighted in a current exhibition I curated for the New-York Historical Society, ''The Changing Face of Liberty: Female Allegories of America.''</p>
