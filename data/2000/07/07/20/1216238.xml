        <p>For the second time this week, a damaging memo from Prime Minister Tony Blair's inner circle has been leaked to major newspapers and caused acute embarrassment to his government as it struggles to keep its once-high popular appeal from continuing its swoon.</p>
        <p>''Our current situation is serious,'' said the confidential message published today and written by Philip Gould, the government's pollster. ''The New Labor brand has been badly contaminated. It is the object of constant criticism and, even worse, ridicule.''</p>
        <p>The note echoed many of the concerns raised in a secret memo written by Mr. Blair himself that found its way into newspapers Monday. That message, composed on the prime minister's own personal computer, reflected his anxiety that New Labor, as he calls the party he recast from its old socialist model, was losing touch with ordinary voters and was failing to convince them that it shared their worries over crime, the family, defense and patriotism.</p>
        <p>The first leak caused distress at 10 Downing Street because it portrayed Mr. Blair as a politician consumed with short-term popularity gains rather than as a reformer with a long-range vision, the image he and his handlers like to put forward.</p>
        <p>Today's disclosure upset Labor strategists because of its timing, coming right after Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, announced a $65 billion cash injection into public services intended to put the Conservatives on the defensive as attention focuses on the national election expected next year. Newspapers changed their front pages late Tuesday night to accommodate the leak story and subordinated the coverage of the new investments, Labor's first good news in months.</p>
        <p>In his own leaked message, dated April 29, Mr. Blair complained that the government was perceived as weak on crime, asylum seekers, defense and family issues. ''It is bizarre that any government I head should be seen as anti-family,'' said the prime minister, whose wife, Cherie, was eight months pregnant at the time with their fourth child.</p>
        <p>''The government -- and this even applies to me -- are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts,'' he wrote. He called for a series of tough ''eye-catching initiatives,'' concluding, ''I should be personally associated with as much of this as possible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gould's memo, written in May, said: ''The government has been drifting and growing almost monthly weaker and more diffuse. Above all else, I have a sense of a government which started with great strength but has seen that strength ebb away and erode as the months and years have passed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair has asked Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary, to try to find the source of the leaks, but past investigations of this kind have proved fruitless.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the memos were given to the chief political correspondents of The Times of London, a major broadsheet, and The Sun, the best-selling daily tabloid.</p>
        <p>The Blair government has been dogged by six other leaks in the last three months. They ranged from an internal note from Britain's ambassador to Japan to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook about Britain and European monetary union to a request from Mr. Blair to his staff researchers for ''killer facts'' he could use to defeat the Conservative leader, William Hague, in the weekly Prime Minister's Questions debate in Parliament. They also included two other Philip Gould warnings about Labor's losing ground to the Tories on populist issues like law and order and the handling of asylum seekers.</p>
        <p>All the leaks have benefited the Conservatives, and Labor officials accused the party of being behind the disclosures. But the Conservatives' chairman, Michael Ancram, said he believed they were being orchestrated by dissidents within the government. ''This latest leak is a further indication of the bitter internal war that is raging in the heart of the Labor government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Blair has seen the 20-point lead that his government had steadily held over the Conservatives since coming to power in 1997 fade to single digits. The most recent canvass, an I.C.M. poll published in The Guardian on Tuesday, showed Labor only seven points ahead of the Tories, and Mr. Gould's memo predicted it could soon go down to five.</p>
        <p>While those figures are worrisome to the government in light of how recently they were much more favorable, they still reflect a higher popularity rating for the Blair government than any other British government has ever recorded after three years in office. Labor gained a majority of 179 seats in Parliament in the May 1997 election, and its current poll numbers would still translate into a comfortable majority of 127.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gould, 50, is one of the five-man group associated with the creation of New Labor that also includes Mr. Blair, Mr. Brown, Peter Mandelson, now the Northern Ireland secretary, and Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's chief spokesman.  He is a former advertising man who was brought into the party in 1985 by Mr. Mandelson, then the communications director, to equip it with modern marketing and media techniques and give it a brand identification that would be acceptable to the electorate.</p>
        <p>He regularly tracks attitudes through focus groups that aim to find out what people think in greater depth than opinion polls do. He distills their comments into the phrases used to guide strategists in coming up with policies that respond to public mood. Critics of New Labor have complained that this approach favors image over substance and that the public has consequently lost faith in the party as one of any convictions of its own.</p>
