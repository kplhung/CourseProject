        <p>President Clinton has told friends and associates that two of his favorite choices for Vice President Al Gore's running mate are former Senator George J. Mitchell and Senator Bob Graham, both of whom he considered picking eight years ago.</p>

        <p>President Clinton has told friends and associates that two of his favorite choices for Vice President Al Gore's running mate are former Senator George J. Mitchell and Senator Bob Graham, both of whom he considered picking eight years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has gone out of his way to stay clear of the selection process, people close to him said, because he wanted to avoid appearing as though  he was imposing his preferences on Mr. Gore or injecting himself into his vice president's campaign.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Clinton is regarded by many Democrats as his party's most brilliant strategist. And when he is questioned privately at party functions about who he thinks would make sound choices, he has not been reluctant about offering his opinion.</p>
        <p>''The president is a political brain attached to a body,'' said a Democratic lobbyist who has heard Mr. Clinton rattle off vice presidential possibilities recently. ''He can't help himself. It's how he's wired.''</p>
        <p>People close to Mr. Clinton said he sounded most animated when he was discussing Mr. Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader from Maine whom he picked to preside over the peace negotiations in Ireland. Mr. Clinton has told people that Mr. Mitchell would bring a weight and dignity to the ticket, has no skeletons in his closet and would be particularly appealing because he is Catholic.</p>
        <p>''Clinton loves him,'' said a strategist close to the president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton had considered Mr. Mitchell as a potential running mate in 1992, but he was not on the final short list, people involved in the process say.</p>
        <p>The president also tells people he has quite high regard for Senator Graham of Florida, who aides at the time said he came quite close to selecting eight years ago. The president has long been deeply interested -- some of his aides say obsessed -- in winning Florida for the Democrats and has told people that could happen if Mr. Graham were on the ticket.</p>
        <p>One person who worked closely with Mr. Clinton eight years ago said he remembered that the then-Governor of Arkansas said more than once that Mr. Graham, who had been Governor of Florida, ''was the best governor I served with.''</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Mr. Graham said that after undergoing the background checks and interview with Mr. Clinton in 1992 he was not sure whether he would be picked. But he said he had been ''anxious'' because he was seeking re-election that year and wanted the matter settled. In Florida, candidates cannot run simultaneously for the Senate and on the national ticket.</p>
        <p>''Did I feel as if I was going to get a call to join the ticket or definitely not going to get one? I didn't know,'' Mr. Graham recalled.</p>
        <p>Asked if he discussed his prospects for helping Mr. Clinton win Florida that year, Mr Graham said: ''I'm sure we did. He has told me personally that he feels one of the major mistakes that was made in '92 was that they gave up on Florida too early.''</p>
        <p>Friends of Mr. Clinton said he is also intrigued with Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana because of Mr. Bayh's involvement with the Democratic Leadership Council -- a centrist group that Mr. Clinton once headed -- and because he would evoke a energetic and vibrant image, similar to when Mr. Clinton picked Mr. Gore in 1992.</p>
        <p>One person close to Mr. Clinton said the president spoke positively early on about William S. Cohen, a former Republican senator who is defense secretary. But Mr. Cohen is not discussed much anymore by people close to Mr. Gore. Some Gore loyalists said they had been disturbed about nice things Mr. Cohen said about Gov. George W. Bush in a television interview in May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton can be considered an expert on the selection of a running mate. He sometimes says that his choice of Mr. Gore will be an important part of his legacy.</p>
        <p>The president's musings are very sensitive in Mr. Gore's circles. People who have discussed the No. 2 slot with the president said he has been careful not to push one prospect above another.</p>
        <p>''He's smart enough not to say, 'My first choice is . . . ' '' said one Democratic official who has talked with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>That official also said he believed that Mr. Gore was so concerned about being viewed as independent from the administration that he might change his mind on a choice if it looked like he was following the president's counsel.</p>
        <p>Like his vice president, Mr. Clinton seems to enjoy keeping up the suspense. At a fund-raising reception last month for Senator Christopher J.  Dodd of Connecticut, Mr. Clinton joked about the selection process in a hotel ballroom full of senators.</p>
        <p>''It's an amazing crowd of people here tonight,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And not all of them want to be vice president. But a lot do.''</p>
        <p>Among those in the audience were Senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Harry Reid of Nevada.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Gore Won't Name Names</p>
        <p>(By The New York Times), CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, July 19 -- Mr. Gore said tonight that he wanted a vice president who would be much like himself, someone who has helped the president carry the load of a job so heavy that it ages the occupants of the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>''I have been able to help my country by strengthening President Clinton's hand and helping him in a thousand ways carry the heavy load that sometimes is pretty crushing for a president of the United States,'' Mr. Gore said here in response to a question at a town meeting.</p>
        <p>''You see it up close,'' he said of his spot at the president's side. ''Have you ever noticed how all of them seem to age in office? You know? That's because the burdens really are heavy, and I'm excited about the opportunity but I've seen it close enough to know that it's a hard job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore still refused to discuss any names publicly. ''I'm trying to keep the process as private and dignified as possible,'' he said, ''so that the ones that aren't picked aren't accidentally hurt in the process.''</p>
