        <p>Zen is out, personal is in. Or at least that is what two new Paris clothing shops, Eric Bergere and Antoine &amp; Lili, are saying with their anything-but-minimalist interiors. For Mr. Bergere's shop, left, near the Tuileries and around the corner from Colette, he asked the interior designer India Mahdavi to help personalize the space with black lacquer shelves and drawers, bright red furnishings, a kitschy wallpaper-panel forest scene and, for a touch of the Gothic, an iron chandelier. ''I wanted to tell a story and not just display products,'' Mr. Bergere said. The shop is at 16, rue de la Sourdiere; (011) 33-1-47-03-33-19.</p>

        <p>A couple of miles east, in the 10th Arrondissement, the sixth Antoine &amp; Lili in Paris (there is also one in London) sells hip, casual clothes and offers a bright cafe (below right top and bottom) in three storefronts painted pink, green and yellow. Trinkets and furnishings are for sale, including the flea market finds, below, painted in Day-Glo colors (the upholstered chair, $170; the table, $500) and plastic floor mats from Africa, $40. The store has the ambience of a sunny, hot climate. In the cafe, plastic tablecloths from Morocco and cushions in printed fabrics from China add lively touches. ''There is no calculated concept,'' said Alexandre Gattegno, one of the three creators of Antoine &amp; Lili. ''It is just stuff we like or find in our travels.'' A shop and cafe are planned for New York. In the meantime, there's www.antoineetlili.com. The new Paris shop is at 95, quai de Valmy; (011) 33-1-40-37-41-55.</p>
