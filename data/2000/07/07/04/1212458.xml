        <p>In late June 1776, British ships from Halifax appeared off Sandy Hook, N.J., just beyond the Narrows from the tip of Manhattan. The ships' masts resembled ''a wood of pine trees trimmed,'' one observer wrote. Soon British soldiers had landed on Staten Island and their flotilla was anchored offshore. On July 9, a Tuesday, Gen. George Washington mustered his troops in New York City for the reading, ''with an audible voice,'' of the Declaration of Independence, which had been signed five days earlier. The purpose was to inform each soldier gathered there that ''he is now in the service of a State, possessed of sufficient power to reward his merit, and advance him to the highest Honors of a free Country.''</p>
        <p>There is a martial cast to that last phrase, naturally. The highest honors, given the context, were military honors, the reward of courage and sacrifice in defense of the world's newest state. Yet in a sense the highest honor of a free country is really freedom itself. It is hard to recapture the turmoil in the colonies during the months leading up to the Declaration of Independence, the sense of upheaval and exhaustion. What Washington's soldiers heard that day -- the fresh sound of those now-familiar phrases -- was the news of their collective freedom.

        <p>In late June 1776, British ships from Halifax appeared off Sandy Hook, N.J., just beyond the Narrows from the tip of Manhattan.

        <p>There is a martial cast to that last phrase, naturally. The highest honors, given the context, were military honors, the reward of courage and sacrifice in defense of the world's newest state. Yet in a sense the highest honor of a free country is really freedom itself. It is hard to recapture the turmoil in the colonies during the months leading up to the Declaration of Independence, the sense of upheaval and exhaustion. What Washington's soldiers heard that day -- the fresh sound of those now-familiar phrases -- was the news of their collective freedom. Perhaps they also hoped for the return of mundane times in which to savor it.</p>
        <p>It would have been sharp in those soldiers' minds just what they were suddenly independent from, for it was visible across the bay, symbolized by that forest of British spars near Staten Island. It was visible, too, in the streets of Manhattan, in an equestrian statue of George III that was overturned on Bowling Green that night. But for most Americans now, it takes a conscious act of memory and imagination to sense our independence, to become aware of our collective freedom. It has been a long time since there were hostile warships in New York Harbor, a long time since the independence of this nation was seriously at risk, the way it was in its first days.</p>
        <p>Historians have often noted that the most ringing phrases in the Declaration of Independence -- the assertion of self-evident truths -- are really philosophical propositions rather than actual descriptions of the human condition in late-18th-century America. But over time the proposition that all men are created equal has become, fitfully, a more and more accurate account of what life really looks like in America. The meaning of that phrase has been extended to include those whom it implicitly excluded, linguistically and politically, when it was first written.</p>
        <p>The unintended irony of American history is that every group that comes to the equality of collective freedom for the first time, whether emancipated slaves or enfranchised women or newly arrived immigrants, has reinstructed the rest of us in its value. They remind us of the stirring that Washington's soldiers would have felt as the declaration was read aloud to them in the streets of Manhattan. They remind us also that the highest honor of this free country is just what it has always been, a freedom to be shared equally, without prejudice.</p>
