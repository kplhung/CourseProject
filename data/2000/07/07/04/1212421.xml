        <p>Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, warned today that inflation is rising an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend economists say could severely strain incomes of ordinary Russians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who is making his first attempts at formulating economic policy, was quoted as suggesting at a Kremlin meeting that the government should take steps to slow the pace of inflation.</p>
        <p>The president met with cabinet ministers and with the chairman of the Russian central bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, according to the Interfax news agency, and it was unclear from the accounts of the meeting what such anti-inflation steps might be.</p>
        <p>But the possibilities included restricting the sharp growth in the supply of money. ''The money supply is more than what the economy can consume,'' Mr. Putin said. ''If these processes continue, every citizen will feel the consequences.''</p>
        <p>Inflation is a pressing concern for Russian households, which have suffered devastating losses in the value of their savings because of price spirals and currency devaluations since the collapse of Communism in 1991.</p>
        <p>Although the exchange value of the ruble has risen markedly the last few months, many Russians are still suffering the effects of a ruble devaluation nearly two years ago, when the government defaulted on billions of dollars worth of debt payments.</p>
        <p>Russian exporters, conversely, have benefited because a cheaper ruble has lowered production costs at home and increased sales abroad.</p>
        <p>Russia's problem today, paradoxically, is that its economy is doing too well. The trade surplus, a barometer of export strength, is nearing $30 billion, and economic growth exceeded 8 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Now with the economy growing quickly, the high demand for rubles has expanded the money supply, spurring inflation. Industries may now lose some of the benefits of the devaluation if the government tightens monetary policy.</p>
        <p>''The clock is ticking,'' said Roland Nash, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. ''The window of opportunity they have from the devaluation is closing -- more quickly than the government was expecting.''</p>
        <p>Preliminary inflation figures showed that June consumer prices rose 2.5 percent from May. That is an annual rate of about 35 percent, which economists say is unsustainable for Russia's economy. The money supply is up about 29 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Still, company profits have improved sharply. Oil companies, the country's main exporters, have reported strong 1999 profits, in part from the rising price of petroleum.</p>
        <p>''It's a great problem to have,'' said Peter Boone, director of research here at the brokerage firm Brunswick Warburg. ''Companies are so cash-rich at the moment that even a 10 percent appreciation of the ruble wouldn't make that much difference in their daily lives.''</p>
