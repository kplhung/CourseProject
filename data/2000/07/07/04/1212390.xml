        <p>James Houpt was practicing magic tricks in front of his mirror recently, making coins disappear, when a reporter called to ask about his health. Mr. Houpt said he was fine. In fact, he had walked two-thirds of a mile that day. ''What's the big deal?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Less than a week before, Mr. Houpt, a 51-year-old cab driver and magician, lay on an operating table at the veterans hospital in Pittsburgh having coronary artery bypass surgery -- and chatting away, albeit groggily, with the surgeons working on his heart.</p>
        <p>The operation, by doctors from the University of Pittsburgh and the V.A. Health-Care System, is thought to be the first in the United States in which a patient had heart surgery without general anesthesia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houpt was able to do so because doctors worked through a small incision in his chest and did not need to stop his heart to operate. Instead of being put into a deep sleep, he had his chest numbed by epidural anesthesia, an injection of painkillers near the spine, outside the spinal canal, similar to the type used for women in labor.</p>
        <p>He was also sedated mildly, but with much smaller drug doses than are used in general anesthesia. As a result, he was awake during parts of the four-hour operation on June 15.</p>
        <p>Unlike patients who receive general anesthesia, which can suppress breathing, he did not need to be put on a respirator or have a breathing tube inserted into his throat.</p>
        <p>''He was sitting up at the end of the surgery and was talking to everyone,'' said his anesthesiologist, Dr. Juhan Paiste, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, because of the sedation, Mr. Houpt has little memory of what went on. ''I was just vaguely aware,'' he said, adding that he had no pain during the operation.</p>
        <p>The procedure was the latest step in doctors' efforts to make heart surgery safer, less invasive and less daunting to patients.</p>
        <p>''Why expose the patient to the risks of general anesthesia and the trauma of intubation, if we can eliminate it?'' said Mr. Houpt's surgeon, Dr. Marco Zenati, director of minimally invasive cardiac surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to make bypass surgery an outpatient procedure.''</p>
        <p>Not only will that be better for patients, he said, but it will also benefit surgeons, who are seeing more patients decline bypass in favor of angioplasty, a procedure often performed by cardiologists rather than surgeons, in which a tiny balloon is inflated to open a clogged artery by squashing the deposits that block it. Many patients prefer that procedure because it is far less invasive than surgery and does not require general anesthesia. But often, Dr. Zenati said, the vessels close up again and people eventually need surgery anyway.</p>
        <p>That happened to Mr. Houpt, who was then scheduled for ''beating-heart surgery.'' Unlike a traditional heart operation, in which the patient's heart is stopped and his  blood circulated by a heart-lung machine, in beating-heart surgery doctors work on the heart while it is still pumping, and no heart-lung machine is required. Dr. Zenati said he had performed 500 beating-heart operations since 1995.</p>
        <p>But beating-heart surgery is controversial, because of evidence that its benefits do not last as long as those from traditional bypass operations. Dr. Steven Gundry, head of cardiothoracic surgery at Loma Linda (Calif.) University Medical Center, led a study showing that patients who had beating-heart surgery in 1989 and 1990 were more likely than those who had traditional operations to develop blockages in the arteries that doctors had worked on. But Dr. Gundry said surgical techniques had changed since then, and he thought long-term results would improve, though more studies were needed to find out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houpt was a candidate for epidural anesthesia because he needed a bypass of just one vessel, which could be done in a ''minimally invasive'' way, with a few small incisions, without cutting open the chest.</p>
        <p>The beating-heart technique can be used for bypass surgery because a bypass does not require doctors to cut open the heart itself. To reroute blood around clogged arteries, surgeons simply stitch replacement vessels, usually taken from the patient's  legs or chest, onto the outside of the heart.</p>
        <p>Dr. Zenati said he began thinking about using epidurals for bypass surgery in January, after seeing a videotape of the procedure being done by Dr. Haldun Y. Karagoz of Guven Hospital in Ankara, Turkey.</p>
        <p>''It made a lot of sense to me,'' Dr. Zenati said. ''We thought there is no down side in doing an epidural, in starting that way, and if the patient does not tolerate it, we will put him asleep and put the tube down.''</p>
        <p>The surgical team was fully prepared to switch to general anesthesia and the heart-lung machine if necessary. Doctors feared that Mr. Houpt might feel pain or nausea when surgeons cut the pericardium, the sac around the heart, which would not be numbed by the epidural. But he did not.</p>
        <p>They also worried about breathing problems because, they knew, the incision on the left side of his chest would cause one lung to collapse. If he could not breathe, a respirator would be needed.</p>
        <p>In addition, if the epidural was even the tiniest bit off the mark, the painkiller could have paralyzed Mr. Houpt's diaphragm, leaving him unable to breathe on his own.</p>
        <p>But the procedure went smoothly. Dr. Zenati and Dr. Paiste said they expected to try it again. But they were not sure how quickly other surgical teams would, or should, try it. Both said the team had to be highly experienced with beating-heart surgery and epidurals. And Dr. Paiste said some surgeons did not like to wait the 15 or 20 minutes needed for an epidural to take effect, and some were not comfortable operating on a patient who is awake.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gundry said he might consider using the epidural technique, but not anytime soon. He said it could be risky to do heart surgery on a patient who did not have a tube in his windpipe to give doctors immediate access in case of an emergency. ''When and if we prove beating heart is as good or better than traditional surgery, then is the time to start branching out,'' he said.</p>
