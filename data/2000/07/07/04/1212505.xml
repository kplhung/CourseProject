        <p>The Mets will start Bobby M. Jones against the Marlins on Tuesday afternoon, giving the left-hander his first start in the majors this year.</p>
        <p>Jones pitched once for the Mets in June, working a scoreless inning, and he has not started for Class AAA Norfolk in about three weeks. But he has worked two side sessions in that time and pitched once in relief, and General Manager Steve Phillips said over the weekend that Jones would be able to throw 120 pitches if he started on Tuesday.

        <p>The Mets will start Bobby M. Jones against the Marlins on Tuesday afternoon, giving the left-hander his first start in the majors this year.</p>
        <p>Jones pitched once for the Mets in June, working a scoreless inning, and he has not started for Class AAA Norfolk in about three weeks. But he has worked two side sessions in that time and pitched once in relief, and General Manager Steve Phillips said over the weekend that Jones would be able to throw 120 pitches if he started on Tuesday. The left-hander was held out of his scheduled start at Norfolk tonight.</p>
        <p>The Mets also considered Norfolk right-hander Grant Roberts, who was held to 70 pitches on Friday so he would be able to pitch on short rest. But Roberts struggled that night, and is 4-5 with a 4.69 earned run average this year.</p>
        <p>''That didn't impact the decision,'' Phillips said of Roberts's last start. ''It's not that he's not ready; we could have gone that way with it. We just thought right now, this was the better way to go.''</p>
        <p>Pat Mahomes was another consideration, but Manager Bobby Valentine said he wanted Mahomes to stay in the bullpen, especially with four games in three days against the Yankees this weekend.</p>
        <p>Jones, who was acquired from Colorado in January in the trade that sent Masato Yoshii to the Rockies, is 7-3 with a 4.11 E.R.A. at Norfolk. On the Mets' roster, he replaces Rick Reed, who has a fractured bone in his left wrist, and after Tuesday, his next turn would come against the Yankees on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Phillips said there was ''always a chance'' that Mike Hampton could come back on short rest for that start.</p>
        <p>After the game, the Mets returned the right-hander Jim Mann to Norfolk and promoted Jones.</p>
        <p>Payton Plays It Safe</p>
        <p>Mets center fielder Jay Payton missed his second start in a row tonight when his sprained left wrist did not heal as quickly as he hoped. Joe McEwing replaced him and batted eighth, then moved to left field and replaced Benny Agbayani in the Marlins' ninth when Payton was inserted into center field.</p>
        <p>Payton, who suffered the injury on a routine swing Saturday, did not attempt to swing when he arrived at Pro Player Stadium today. He has a 12-game hitting streak but has missed much of the last four seasons with injuries and knows when the time is right to back off.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to lose playing time,'' he said. ''I want to go out there and play. But at the same time, I know what it's like to play with injuries and make things worse than they are. I have to make sure that I'm all right.''</p>
        <p>Payton estimated that he felt 50 percent better than he did on Sunday, and said he was hopeful he would show the same improvement by Tuesday and be able to hit.</p>
        <p>Abbott's Freakish Injury</p>
        <p>Two Yankees, Jason Grimsley and Chuck Knoblauch, got sick last week because the air-conditioning in their Detroit hotel made their room too cold. The Mets also have an air-conditioner-related injury, though this one was more severe.</p>
        <p>Infielder Kurt Abbott, whose back has been bothering him since an awkward slide at the end of May, felt a pop in his back when he bent down to adjust the air-conditioner in his apartment on Saturday night. He went to bed, woke up in intense pain, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list today with a bulging disk.</p>
        <p>''It sounds bizarre,'' Abbott said, ''but it was a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>The Mets recalled infielder David Lamb from Norfolk. Lamb, a former Tampa Bay Devil Ray, who was batting .230 for Norfolk, is the first switch-hitter the Mets have had this season.</p>
        <p>One Fewer Possibility</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips said that while the Minnesota Twins had told the Mets they would put them on the list of teams interested in the right-hander Brad Radke, the Twins never made him available. Radke signed a four-year contract extension with Minnesota today, ending months of trade speculation.</p>
        <p>''It's always about supply and demand,'' Phillips said. ''The supply has been lessened by one potential guy, and presumably the demand remains the same.''</p>
        <p>The Mets will be without Rick Reed for part of the time before the trade deadline, weakening the rotation, but Phillips said nothing could change to seriously alter his strategy.</p>
