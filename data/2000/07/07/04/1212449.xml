        <p>Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization decided late tonight in Gaza City that a Palestinian state should be declared by mid-September, whether or not a permanent peace deal has been reached with the Israelis.</p>
        <p>In so doing, the Palestinian Central Council was expressing the general Palestinian frustration with the peace effort that has been voiced frequently and pungently by Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>But it was also locking Mr. Arafat, with his assent, into a tight, potentially explosive time frame. A unilateral declaration of statehood in September could set off a conflagration. Israel has already said that it might respond to such a declaration by annexing swaths of the West Bank, and the subsequent dynamic could engender serious extended violence.</p>
        <p>A unilateral declaration could also complicate Mr. Arafat's pursuit of international recognition for his state and complicate his standing domestically.</p>
        <p>Yet in the Middle East peace effort, deadlines have proved flexible.</p>
        <p>And tonight's decision is part of the latest maneuvering, a move that aims to pressure Israel to consider the consequences of a failure at the negotiation tables. Few think that Mr. Arafat would consider himself bound by the P.L.O. decision if the talks were moving at full speed in a direction that pleased him but were not concluded by mid-September.</p>
        <p>For now, though, he is frustrated.</p>
        <p>Eight days ago, at a rally in Nablus in the West Bank, Mr. Arafat was saying, ''Palestine is ours, ours, ours,'' and telling cheering supporters that he would declare a state ''in a few weeks.''</p>
        <p>And in a speech to the Central Council on Sunday, Mr. Arafat told the more than 100 members that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel ''has no intention to reach an agreement but rather wants confrontation.'' He said that Mr. Barak had directed the Israeli Army chief of staff, Shaul Mofaz, to threaten the Palestinians with talk of tanks and helicopters and that the Palestinians must be prepared to deal with such tactics as an Israeli cutoff of electricity and water.</p>
        <p>''We are at a dangerous crossroads,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Israelis and the Palestinians had set a target of Sept. 13 to achieve a final peace accord that would end their conflict, resolve the thorny issues of Jerusalem and refugees, and settle borders for the future Palestinian state. Mr. Arafat said frequently that the Palestinians reserved the right to declare statehood unilaterally after that date if the accord was not accomplished.</p>
        <p>Israel has been pushing for an immediate three-way, retreat-style summit meeting in the United States to move the stalemated peace talks into a higher gear.</p>
        <p>But the Palestinians have resisted, saying that such a meeting now would be doomed to failure.</p>
        <p>Both Israeli and Palestinian news media reported today that they expect the Americans to convene a summit meeting the third week of July and to consider it an intermediate summit meeting that would be followed by another or others.</p>
        <p>American officials say President Clinton has not yet decided to propose such a plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's population has endured increasing frustration as it awaits the supposed fruits of the peace effort. If the path toward peace ends in violent conflict, many Palestinians would direct their anger not only at Israel but at Mr. Arafat and his government, experts say.</p>
        <p>The internal tensions have been on full display in the last few days in the West Bank. The Palestinian-governed city of Ramallah was shuttered for the third day in a row today after a spasm of violence that grew out of a gang feud and turned into a volatile situation for the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>The American Consulate today issued an unusual travel ban for its American employees, warning against travel to Ramallah until the situation calms.</p>
        <p>A 25-year-old woman, Ahlam Dokmak, caught in the middle of a feud between her brother and a rival over a stolen car, was shot dead on Saturday in her family's butcher shop in Ramallah. That act of violence spiraled into a couple of days of rampaging in the streets, including looting, shooting and the burning of two restaurants.</p>
        <p>At a nearby refugee camp, the Palestinian police arrested the man they said did the shooter and his accomplices, and in a summary trial early this morning, a Palestinian security court sentenced the man to death by hanging. That provoked more demonstrations. Refugees marched from the Amari camp into Ramallah, where they clashed with Palestinian troops. An exchange of gunfire left 15 wounded, four of them seriously.</p>
        <p>Residents of Ramallah were saddened and angry by what they saw as lawlessness on the one hand, and an overreaction by the authorities on the other.</p>
        <p>The violence highlighted the sensitive relationship between the Palestinian government and the refugees, with whom they are trying to avoid any conflict.</p>
