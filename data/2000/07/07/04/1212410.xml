        <p>It sounds like something out of a 1940's film archive: a group of Americans, driven by great human suffering, travel to a strange foreign land to offer succor to the needy. But this isn't a movie, though it is humanitarianism, Hollywood style.</p>
        <p>The project is called Filmaid International, and its mission is to aid refugees worldwide, albeit in a way that has little to do with such basic needs as water or medicine. Instead, Filmaid's goal is to import Hollywood's most plentiful natural resource: movies.</p>
        <p>Founded last year by Caroline Baron, a film producer, Filmaid's mission is to bring feature films, children's cartoons and other  screen entertainment to refugee camps, where the horrors of war are often succeeded by bad memories, isolation and tedium.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barron's group, organied in just eight weeks, traveled to five refugee camps in Macedonia last summer, toting several small movie screens, a pair of video projectors and a generator. At each camp, the group's volunteer technicians and projectionists assembled a makeshift open-air  movie house and screened movies like ''Titanic,'' ''Mrs. Doubtfire'' and ''E.T.'' for crowds ranging in size from 300 to 4,000.</p>
        <p>Working with such aid organizations as the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filmaid also branched out into other services, screening educational films on AIDS and domestic violence and employing camp members as projectionists and technicians.</p>
        <p>To pay for all of this, Ms. Baron, 38, turned to the film industry, a source not exactly known for global philanthropy. Ms. Baron said she found a remarkably receptive audience. In its first six weeks of operation, Filmaid received donations of cash and supplies from industry sources including Universal Studios, cobiMGM and Miramax Films. Some high-profile names also lent  support. Robert DeNiro, who worked with Ms. Baron on the film ''Flawless,'' joined the group's advisory committee, as did the actresses Susan Sarandon and Julia Ormond, and Harvey Weinstein, Miramax's  co-founder.</p>
        <p>By the time their trip ended in mid-August, Ms. Baron's group had also been invited to visit the troubled Kosovo region, screening the silent films of Charlie Chaplin  and Tom and Jerry cartoons to audiences of recently repatriated Kosovars. Along the way, Filmaid had drawn praise from several more established aid operations.</p>
        <p>''We were surprised by how successful they were, really pleasantly pleased,'' said Reynold Levy, president of the International Rescue Committee. ''One of the major issues for refugees and particularly children is sheer boredom. They have no routine, they have no school, their parents are clearly distracted. The opportunity to engage in group activities helps restore a sense of normalcy. And that's exactly what Filmaid provided.''</p>
        <p>So successful was Filmaid's first endeavor that the rescue committee has formally adopted the organization as an official project and authorized its next mission: a six-month expedition, beginning in October, to Guinea in West Africa, which is home to estimated 500,000 refugees from civil wars.</p>
        <p>And so it is that Ms. Baron, a veteran of the fantasyland of movie sets and film shoots, has found herself in the unlikely position of de facto international aid expert.</p>
        <p>''It is funny to me sometimes,'' she said. ''I mean, I had to look up Guinea in the atlas.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Baron says that the idea for Filmaid came to her last year after she saw a photograph of a mother clutching her dying son on a street in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''I just began to go, 'What I am doing about this?','' Ms. Baron said in a recent interview. ''I just thought there's got to be something I can do.''  So she began to make calls.</p>
        <p>What she found was an enormous outpouring of support. One of the first people Ms. Baron called was the producer Jane Rosenthal (''Wag the Dog,'' ''Analyze This''), who had also been following the refugee crisis in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''She said, 'What if we send movies over there?,'' Ms. Rosenthal recalls. ''I said, 'Count me in.' It was really all Caroline. All I did was second the  motion.''</p>
        <p>Working with Jeffrey Silver, a Los Angeles film producer, Ms. Baron began to solicit donations: a projector here, a generator there. The group also received support from more traditional nonprofit organizations like the William Jelin Memorial Trust and George Soros's Open Society. Tower Air, which is now bankrupt, donated free flights for the support crew needed to run the project's projectors and generators.</p>
        <p>There were skeptics. ''People were worried that it could be viewed as frivolous,'' Ms. Baron said. ''We're talking movies here, after all, not food or shelter.''</p>
        <p>But aid officials say that especially for refugee children, entertainment is a much-needed resource, helping to distract them and dull the psychological impact of war and displacement. Large aid organizations like Unicef and Save the Children try to supply toys and sports equipment for that reason.</p>
        <p>''People think of relief as shelter, food, water, and in truth, it's not  really that hard to raise money for projects like that,'' said Robyn Groves, the senior external relations officer for the United Nations High Command. ''But not a lot of people  think what happens after the basic necessities are taken care of.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Groves was one of several aid officials who attended a party last week in celebration of the project's first anniversary, an event that drew a mix of foreign aid officials and film people like Mira Nair, the Indian director of ''Mississippi Masala,'' and ''Salaam Bombay.'' (Ms. Baron was co-producer of Ms. Nair's 1995 film ''Kama Sutra'' and is producing her next project, ''Monsoon Wedding,'' which begins filming in India next month.)</p>
        <p>''I think there's a lot of Hollywood do-gooders,'' Ms. Rosenthal said. ''There's a new generation giving back to the community in a significant way. I think we're far more socially and politically active.''</p>
        <p>The celebration was also the informal kickoff for Filmaid's fund-raising for the Guinea project. Budgeted at approximately $350,000, that expedition will face far more difficult logistical challenges, including poor  roads, a lack of vehicles and a high crime rate.</p>
        <p>In preparation Ms. Baron visited Guinea earlier this year with Mary  Soan, a British director who serves on Filmaid's executive committee,  and met with aid workers, teachers and organizations like Doctors without Borders.</p>
        <p>''It was amazing to me,'' said Ms. Baron. ''They said, 'We want to see hopeful films.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Groves, who has visited camps in Angola, Iran, Macedonia and parts of Southeast Asia, said, ''Refugee camps are really appalling places,'' but films can make them better.</p>
        <p>''It's like relief for the soul, relief from the boredom, trauma and anxiety of those places, she said, adding, ''Two hours of fantasy can go a long way.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 6, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Filmaid International, which shows movies at refugee camps, misidentified a supporter of the organization in one reference. It is the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, not the High Command.</p>
