        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio began a five-day bus tour across the state today, balancing an effort to direct his United States Senate campaign toward issues against consistent attacks on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>At times, he managed to do both.</p>
        <p>After beginning his tour with a visit to a Long Island health clinic, where he called for more money for breast cancer research and took credit as the ''point man in the House'' on cancer issues, he labeled Mrs. Clinton's effort to come up with a universal health care plan a ''monstrosity.''</p>
        <p>At times, he overlooked apparent incongruities.</p>
        <p>At a rally in Yonkers before about 75 supporters, Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton ''can't get out of the motorcade'' to empathize with drivers frustrated by high gasoline prices. But he did so while standing in front of his large, idling, customized campaign bus -- hardly a model of fuel economy -- which had just been escorted by motorized police through city streets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, a Republican, is on his second such bus tour since beginning his campaign May 20. He is making the most of a Congressional recess after a few weeks of being largely pinned down in Washington while Mrs. Clinton went on the offensive with strident language on the stump and a barrage of attack television advertisements. She, too, plans a  tour upstate later this week, as both candidates court voters in a region campaign officials see as crucial to victory in November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's tour, orchestrated down to the kind of attire he will wear at certain stops, will include campaign staples like parade appearances, including three planned for Independence Day. But as he rides a bus named ''Mainstream Express,'' he will also use campaign stops to highlight legislation he has sponsored or supported and make pointed contrasts to Mrs. Clinton. Mixed in will be traditional party rallies, like one here tonight that drew about 50 people to a park under a steady drizzle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio used strong language today, but some of the strongest words came from his surrogates, including Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers, a Republican who at the rally in his city railed against ''elite Democratic liberals looking down the nose of the people of Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>And as he boarded his bus, Mr. Lazio's campaign aides blasted a snippet from a Ray Charles song, ''What'd I Say'': ''Tell your ma, tell your pa, going to send you back to Arkansas.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Lazio said he was merely reciprocating the negative campaigning that Mrs. Clinton had started, a claim the Clinton campaign disputes. ''We were in the race for less than a month before she personally went on the attack and began airing these negative distortion ads,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>He continued tonight, telling supporters at the Schenectady rally that ''character does count,'' as well as integrity, without directly accusing Mrs. Clinton of lacking either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's theme today was health care, and he toured a hospital in Suffern, in Rockland County, and a clinic in Brentwood, on Long Island, to speak on women's health issues. He referred to legislation he co-sponsored last year that provides Medicaid to poor women needing treatment for breast and cervical cancer. He counts the bill, which eventually passed, among his signature achievements, although House Democrats often assert that the Republican leadership stalled its passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also urged the passage of a bill he introduced last week that would continue financing for breast cancer research through the sale of postage stamps. ''We need to make sure we put the foot on the research accelerator,'' he said in Brentwood.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign office issued a statement deriding Mr. Lazio's record on health care and criticizing him for not supporting a ''patients' bill of rights'' backed by Democrats last fall that would have allowed people more latitude to sue their health maintenance organizations over mistreatment.</p>
        <p>''Carefully staged photo ops won't change the fact that Rick Lazio has  committed legislative malpractice,'' Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in the statement. ''He voted against a real patient's bill of rights, against a prescription drug plan that will cover all seniors, and voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion. For New Yorkers looking for real health care solutions, Rick Lazio's rhetoric is a bitter pill to swallow.''</p>
