        <p>In a move to bring down stubbornly high oil prices, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, announced plans yesterday to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.</p>
        <p>The decision will go into effect within the next few days ''if the price doesn't decrease,'' according to a statement from the Saudi Arabian oil minister quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency.</p>
        <p>The unilateral step by the Saudis comes less than two weeks after the 10-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader, decided to increase production by 708,000 barrels a day, hoping to rein in crude oil prices that exceeded $30 a barrel. The price of crude instead rose, driven by the disappointment in the market that the production increase was not greater, as had been widely expected.</p>
        <p>The announcement came after commodities markets in London closed, and the first United States reaction will only become apparent after the Independence Day holiday. Analysts believe the new increase in output will dampen crude oil prices. The increase most likely comes too late to affect United States gasoline prices this summer, analysts said, but they are cautiously optimistic that it will push down prices for heating oil, which have jumped 10 percent the last month.</p>
        <p>''Any additional oil supply is good news for the American consumer,'' said John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington trade group. ''But demand continues to grow, so it's not clear how much prices will decline.''</p>
        <p>The 500,000 barrels a day constitute a small fraction of the 75 million barrels a day the world consumes. Typically, for every $1 decrease in the price of crude oil, there follows a 2.5 cent decline in the price of gasoline and other petroleum products.</p>
        <p>The United States market will not see the first of the new oil until early August or so, because it takes about 40 days for Persian Gulf crude to reach American ports. By that time, gasoline prices should be tapering off on their own, as vacation season winds down and people begin to drive less. But the oil would arrive just as refineries begin to build stocks of heating oil for the winter.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department reported last week that inventories of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, were 21 percent lower than last year. Surging demand for diesel has drawn distillate out of refineries as quickly as it flowed in, leading to a rapid rise in heating oil prices. New Saudi oil could ease the supply shortage and help drive heating oil prices lower, though perhaps only slightly.  But recent production increases by OPEC have failed to reduce crude oil prices, primarily because robust economies, especially that of the United States, demand more oil than the cartel has so far offered. After weathering years of depressed oil prices, OPEC cut production drastically in March 1999 to boost prices. But once crude oil surpassed $30 a barrel earlier this year, OPEC came under pressure from the world's industrialized nations to raise output. The high crude prices also worried some OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, which have seen worldwide recessions unfold because of costly oil.</p>
        <p>OPEC increased output significantly this spring, with little impact on crude prices. When cartel members met again in Vienna 10 days ago, the oil market had been primed for a second increase, on the order of one million barrels a day. It was widely known that cartel members were producing an estimated 500,000 barrels a day more than they had agreed to in spring. So an increase of one million barrels a day would have brought on the market an additional 500,000 barrels of so-called new oil.</p>
        <p>When OPEC announced a more modest increase of 708,000 barrels that would release only about 200,000 barrels of new oil, the market rejected the gesture and crude prices jumped to more than $32 a barrel.</p>
        <p>''OPEC was really surprised that prices went higher after Vienna,'' said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London research group. ''Most people expected one million barrels a day. That would have been enough for the soft landing that people had sought. But that seemed a bridge too far for the hawks in OPEC.''</p>
        <p>Hawkish OPEC members have little to gain by a more substantial increase. Of the 10 active members, all but three -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- are producing at full capacity. The other seven countries lose revenues with any increase in output because they lack the capacity to make up for the fall in crude prices by pumping more oil. That may explain why Saudi Arabia acted swiftly and apparently unilaterally, though in their statement the Saudis said they would raise output ''in consultation with other producers.'' Some observers expect Kuwait and the emirates to also increase production.</p>
        <p>The lopsided decision could increase tensions within the cartel, but that is unlikely to affect Saudi Arabia's decision. ''They were getting really antsy about prices not coming down and about their inability to affect market psychology,'' said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington consulting group. ''Now, the Saudis have taken the oil bull market by the horns and pulled it down.''</p>
