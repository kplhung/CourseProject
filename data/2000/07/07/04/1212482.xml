        <p>It has become an almost weekly routine. Reporters press Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for details on his cancer treatment deliberations. The mayor, sometimes in an irritated voice, other times in a stern but calm way, then tells them, in essence, to bug off.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the matter flared yet again,  prompted by a report in The Daily News on Saturday, citing unnamed sources. The newspaper said that Mr. Giuliani, who announced in April that he had a treatable form of prostate cancer, had started a preliminary hormone therapy.</p>
        <p>''This is a media, press-created craze,'' Mr. Giuliani said, staring down from a City Hall Park stage toward the familiar pack of reporters gathered for his daily news conference. ''The invasion of my privacy, the invasion of my doctor's office, the almost-crazed atmosphere that's created is not conducive to good medical treatment, either for me or for anyone else.''</p>
        <p>The lashing was so intense that while the mayor did not confirm or deny the news, no one asked a follow-up question. Instead, the mayor indicated that he would disclose his decision only when it meant he had to disrupt his work. And there are few hints that that has happened yet, with Mr. Giuliani scheduled to rush today from a late-morning inspection of the New York Harbor parade of tall ships for OpSail 2000 to a Fourth of July parade on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>''When I'm ready and I believe it is in my best interest to announce something, I will,'' the mayor said yesterday, before moving to other topics. ''So far, nothing that I'm doing or not doing has any impact on my work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's approach to the news media regarding his prostate cancer has been relatively consistent from the start. He was praised in April for his immediate and forthright disclosure of the diagnosis. But when it came to discussing details of the disease, he has declined all questions other than to acknowledge, about the time he dropped out of the Senate race in May, that choosing from among the treatment options had been extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>In the early-stage cancer that the mayor has said he has, the most frequent alternatives are surgery or radiation treatment, said Dr. William G. Nelson, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and an oncologist who has not been involved in the mayor's care. The report that the mayor is undergoing hormonal therapy with a drug called Lupron does not necessarily mean he has made up his mind, Dr. Nelson said.</p>
        <p>By reducing the testosterone levels, Lupron merely slows cancer growth and sometimes shrinks the prostate cancer tumor in anticipation of a more intense treatment, Dr. Nelson said. It is more frequently a precursor to radiation treatment than it is to surgery, he said.</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that the mayor's reticence has led to friction between Mr. Giuliani and the news media, several medical ethicists said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The public's expectation that certain elected officials will divulge private and even non-life-threatening health matters dates at least to 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson, after gallbladder surgery, proudly showed off his scar.</p>
        <p>During President Ronald Reagan's tenure, a small spot of cancer on his nose inspired regular news updates with headlines like ''President's Nose 'Terrific' '' and ''Reagan's Nose Unbandaged.'' In New York, a similar type of cancer, considered rarely life-threatening, was found on Mayor Edward I. Koch's nose in 1988, again drawing a flurry of news reports.</p>
        <p>But three experts who have studied issues related to politicians and their health said yesterday that as far as they could determine, the mayor appeared to be justified in declining to answer questions about his treatment.</p>
        <p>Given that there are no signs his condition or any possible treatment is affecting his performance as mayor, he is not currently obliged to discuss the matter further, said Dr. James F. Toole, a professor of neurology at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., and co-chairman of a group that released a report titled ''Disability and U.S. Presidents.''</p>
        <p>There have been times when politicians have not been forthcoming about the seriousness of their conditions. Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, a presidential candidate in 1992 who concealed that he had had a recurrent cancer, died in 1997, as his first term would have been ending. But Dr. Toole said that even if the mayor's case was somewhat more severe than he had indicated, it would not be relevant because he remained on the job and was not seeking a new term or any other elected office.</p>
        <p>George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at the Boston University School of Public Health, and Dr. Joseph J. Fins, director of medical ethics at the New York Weill Cornell Center, said yesterday that the mayor should be allowed to decide on his treatment privately.</p>
        <p>But Professor Annas said that the mayor's reaction to the news media's questioning seemed somewhat naive, given an era of intense fascination with politicians like Mr. Giuliani and the public's heightened interest in matters related to health.</p>
        <p>''This is mostly what you can kindly refer to as gossip, voyeurism,'' Professor Annas said. ''The public wants to know as much as it can about celebrities, and he is a celebrity politician.''</p>
