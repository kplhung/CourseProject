        <p>Pope John Paul II has chosen a son of Newark and a longtime educator to be the spiritual leader of Roman Catholics in Essex County, N.J., the Archdiocese of Newark announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Msgr. Arthur J. Serratelli, the rector of St. Andrew College Seminary at Seton Hall University, was named regional bishop for Essex County, one of four counties, along with Hudson, Bergen and Union, that make up the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Bishop Serratelli, 55, was appointed to fill a vacancy created last summer, when Auxiliary Bishop Nicholas A. DiMarzio was made bishop of Camden, one of the state's five dioceses, with Trenton, Metuchen, Paterson and the Newark archdiocese.</p>
        <p>In his regional role, Bishop Serratelli is essentially the spiritual and administrative head of the county's Roman Catholic parishes and church programs, said Jim Goodness, a spokesman for the archdiocese. He is also one of five auxiliary bishops in the archdiocese who assist Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick, New Jersey's highest Catholic official.</p>
        <p>Apart from the regional bishops, a fifth auxiliary, Bishop Paul Bootkoski, serves as vicar general and moderator of the diocesan curia, handling the day-to-day affairs of the archdiocese. While the regional bishops assist Archbishop McCarrick, who turns 70 on Friday -- five years short of the mandatory retirement age for bishops -- they do not form a line of succession, and a new archbishop will be appointed by the pope regardless of geography.</p>
        <p>The new bishop grew up in Newark and attended Seton Hall Prep in nearby West Orange. He then studied philosophy at Seton Hall University in South Orange, before attending the Immaculate Conception Seminary in Darlington, N.J.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Archbishop McCarrick referred to him as ''a renowned scripture scholar, a beloved seminary rector and most of all a dedicated and holy priest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodness said that Bishop Serratelli had not been chosen to deal with any particular church issue in Essex County. ''I think this is one of those things where a guy was recognized by the Holy Father as someone special, and we have a need for someone to run the day-to-day operations of the diocese,'' he said.</p>
