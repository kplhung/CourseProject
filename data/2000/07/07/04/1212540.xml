        <p>One of the Rangers' most perplexing problems this past season was that they could not seem to find a defenseman to play with the team captain, Brian Leetch. They were working on a possible solution to that issue yesterday, but Glen Sather's plans fell through.</p>

        <p>One of the Rangers' most perplexing problems this past season was that they could not seem to find a defenseman to play with the team captain, Brian Leetch. They were working on a possible solution to that issue yesterday, but Glen Sather's plans fell through.</p>
        <p>Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manager, spoke yesterday to Mark Witkin, the agent for the free-agent defenseman Don Sweeney. Last night, however, Sweeney decided to re-sign with the Boston Bruins, with whom he has spent parts of the past 12 seasons.</p>
        <p>As Witkin said earlier in the day, ''Things change very quickly.''</p>
        <p>They sure did.</p>
        <p>And so Sather's quiet summer stayed that way -- and may continue until next Monday or Tuesday, when Ron Low is expected to be announced as the Rangers' new head coach.</p>
        <p>Low, a former goaltender, was Sather's coach for a spell in Edmonton, where he succeeded George Burnett during the 1995-96 season and continued through the 1998-99 campaign.</p>
        <p>After Sather could not guarantee Low a raise for last season, Low stepped down and coached Houston in the International Hockey League. With Madison Square Garden's backing, Sather can now pay Low better. He is believed to have offered Low a deal worth about $700,000 annually. Low also interviewed with the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a no-comment mode,'' the 50-year-old Low said from his summer cottage in Manitoba yesterday. ''Everything is in freeze frame. It's likely I'll be able to say something next Monday or Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>By then, Low could be speaking from a dais at his introductory news conference in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The team he inherits, right now, will look much like the one that failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season this spring. Unlike last season, when the Rangers went out and signed every available big-name free agent, it has been a silent summer in the hockey offices at Madsion Square Garden thus far.</p>
        <p>Other than the June 1 news conference to announce Sather's appointment, that is.</p>
        <p>Not that Sather isn't trying. Sweeney would have given Leetch someone to play with on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>The Rangers were not the only metropolitan-area team interested in the veteran defenseman. The Islanders' Mike Milbury has always been high on Sweeney, who turns 34 on Aug. 17, dating to Milbury's days in the Bruins' organization, where he was a player, a head coach and an assistant general manager.</p>
        <p>Milbury entered into negotiations with Witkin this week regarding Sweeney. But, according to one league official, the Islanders bowed out because Sweeney's asking price was above $2 million a season. Instead, the Islanders went younger and signed 29-year-old Kevin Haller to a three-year deal that averages about $1.7 million a season.</p>
        <p>St. Louis, meanwhile, signed 30-year-old defenseman Sean Hill, who played for Carolina last season, to a four-year, $9 million contract.</p>
        <p>Sweeney, a Harvard graduate with a degree in economics, was looking for figures closer to what Hill signed for. The Bruins, known for being tight with their purse, ended up giving Sweeney enough for him to stay.</p>
