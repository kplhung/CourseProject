        <p>The rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, will give proof tonight that America's trade deficit with China is still there.</p>
        <p>The United States celebrates its declaration of independence from England by blowing up tons of ornamental ordnance put together in China, the world's last major Communist power. So with every oooh and aaah that Americans utter tonight, with every strontium nitrate starburst (red) or chlorine-laced copper salt flare (blue), that trade deficit increases.</p>
        <p>Even many of the little American flags that people wave at Fourth of July parades are made in China.</p>
        <p>''America is our biggest market,'' says Liu Donghui, head of the Liuyang Fireworks Development Company in Hunan province, birthplace of Mao Zedong, the patriarch of Chinese Communism.</p>
        <p>Fireworks represent only a sliver of the American trade deficit with China, which so far this year exceeds $18 billion. But Americans spent $122.4 million on Chinese fireworks last year and are buying more this year, just as they are buying more Chinese toys, clothes and electronics. And imports from China could increase dramatically when China gains normalized trading relations with the United States and membership in the World Trade Organization, expected later this year.</p>
        <p>The pyrotechnics are most often prepared in cramped Chinese workshops, where low-paid workers put together by hand ''cakes'' of roman candles or ''display shells,'' the largest of which look like brown-paper-wrapped bowling balls sitting on squat cardboard cylinders of black powder. The shells shoot 100 feet into the air for every inch of their diameter, with some reaching 1,200 feet before detonating in a spray of colored fire.</p>
        <p>Most of the fireworks come from Hunan province. Fireworks were invented in China, of course, and the Hunanese have been making them for 1,300 years. In Liuyang, officially designated China's fireworks capital, more than 400,000 people work in the industry, or about a third of all the people in the city.</p>
        <p>The workers are typically separated from each other by a thick wooden partition in case of accidental detonation, though such precautions do not matter much when a combustion gets rolling: an explosion ripped through a southern Chinese fireworks factory last week, killing 36 people and injuring 160. As many as 30 more are missing and thought dead; their bodies have yet to be recovered.</p>
        <p>Chinese fireworks present other dangers. Residue from the poisonous compounds that give the colors their brilliance sift down through the atmosphere after a blast. Scientists in Liuyang say they are looking for ways to clean up their shells because the United States is banning imports of lead-bearing fireworks beginning in August. ''Everyone has been urged to stop using lead,'' said Mr. Liu, the fireworks company chief.</p>
        <p>For those Americans whose hearts beat patriotic at the sight of a skyrocket exploding in the shape of a star, they should know that this display was perfected to honor the People's Liberation Army, whose emblem is a red star, not to represent the stars that spangle America's banner.</p>
        <p>Those Americans opposed to increased trade with China might want to forgo the flags and the fireworks displays and perhaps stick to hand-held sparklers. High antidumping duties, meant to protect United States manufacturers, have kept Chinese sparklers out of the country for the last few years, and cities including New York have banned the unlicensed use of fireworks.</p>
        <p>Then again, sparklers were popularized in England, where they were first used to celebrate the wedding of King Henry VII, so lighting them might be seen as a gesture to America's old colonial rulers.</p>
