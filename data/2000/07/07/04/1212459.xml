      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Vice President Al Gore today accused drug companies of ''price-gouging'' and ''special interest schemes'' to keep drug prices high, and he pledged to a crowd of the elderly to ''fight for you, not for the powerful drug companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's appearance at a community center in the swing state of Missouri began a weeklong Gore drive to highlight an issue that has emerged as one of the most potent this election season: the spiraling cost of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>The vice president worked to tie his main opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, and the Republicans in Congress to the drug industry. ''It is not all that complicated,'' Mr. Gore said at a news conference. ''Governor Bush is with the big pharmaceutical companies.''</p>
        <p>He also contended that drug companies had written the House Republicans' recently passed bill that provides a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients. The Republican bill would rely on private insurance companies to sell drug coverage polices to the elderly, backed by government subsidies and incentives.</p>
        <p>''I think they crafted the actual words,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats support a more expansive measure, relying directly on the Medicare system. Mr. Bush generally supports the House Republican plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has a history of taking on the drug companies, dating to his years in Congress, although some of his friends and advisers now represent the pharmaceutical industry as lobbyists. His campaign advisers believe the issue allows him to draw a sharp contrast with Mr. Bush, who received more campaign contributions from the industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides distributed a list of contributions that drug companies had made to Republicans. Separate figures, provided by the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research organization, showed that Republican Party committees have received $4 million in unregulated ''soft money'' contributions from pharmaceutical companies since January 1999, while Democrats received $1.4 million.</p>
        <p>In response to Mr. Gore's speech, the Bush campaign released a statement by Representative James M. Talent, Republican of Missouri, asserting that the Clinton administration had been ''an obstacle'' to overhauling Medicare for eight years.</p>
        <p>''After eight years of failing to propose a solution,'' Mr. Talent said, ''the vice president is now saying he wants reform.''</p>
        <p>For several years, Democrats have put the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly at the top of their agenda. With drug prices rising faster than the rate of inflation, President Clinton a year ago proposed an expansion of the 34-year-old Medicare program to cover drugs. House Democrats have been riding the issue hard in their quest to regain control of the House -- even running bus trips for the elderly to Canada and Mexico, where drug prices are lower.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, who was at Mr. Gore's side today, said House Democrats would campaign on the issue across the country this week.</p>
        <p>Republicans originally denounced Mr. Clinton's plan as a costly expansion of a program that already faces fiscal difficulties and said they would not take it up unless it was part of a broader overhaul of Medicare.</p>
        <p>But trying to blunt the Democrats' drive, House Republicans just before the July 4 recess pushed through on a near-party-line vote their own measure costing $40 billion over five years, changing the debate to which party's plan is better. John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said Republican House members were also told to conduct town meetings this week to promote their plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feehery said the Republican bill avoided ''a government takeover of health care'' and did not rely on a ''huge government bureaucracy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore pointed to assertions by insurance companies that the Republican bill would not work. He said the Republican bill reminded him of a story about a veterinarian and taxidermist who ''go into work together and they put up a sign saying, 'Either way, you get your dog back.' '' He added, ''There is a difference.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore today heard stories from hard-pressed elderly people, including a woman who told of buying 16 boxes of macaroni and cheese dinners because they cost only $4, saving her money for medicine.</p>
        <p>''You've been eating macaroni and cheese for every meal?'' Mr. Gore prompted her.</p>
        <p>''I can save a little bit of it for the next day, too,'' said Jacqueline Steele Johnson, 72.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to have a system where you are completely at the mercy of the big drug companies and no one is standing up for you,'' the vice president said. ''I want to stand up for you.''</p>
        <p>The drug companies had too much power over drug costs, the vice president said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturer of Claritan D, a top-selling allergy medication, because it is circulating legislation to extend its patent. He said drug patents were not designed to create a situation ''where we can be just exploited forever by the wealthy and the powerful.''</p>
        <p>The Republican drug bill would offer a drug benefit to Medicare recipients that would use private insurance companies to sell drug coverage polices to the elderly, backed by government subsidies and incentives.</p>
        <p>The difference between the Democratic and Republican approaches on prescription drugs involves philosophy and detail. The Democrats rely on the Medicare program, while the Republicans rely on incentives to private insurers to sell policies to the elderly.</p>
        <p>Under the Republican plan, the government would set the parameters of a standard drug policy for the elderly, but premiums and co-payments could vary from one private drug plan to another as long as the overall values met the government standard. The plan envisions premiums of $35 to $40 a month. After a $250 deductible, the policies would pay for half of a recipient's annual drug costs, up to $2,100.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, like other Democrats, has proposed a more generous benefit than the Republicans, which would cost $255 billion over a decade. It would carry no deductible and would cover half of the costs of drugs, up to $5,000. The premium would start at $25 a month.</p>
        <p>The vice president's plan and that of the House Republicans would both contain subsides for low-income seniors and protections for those with high drug costs. The Republicans would provide 100 percent drug-cost coverage after an individual's out-of-pocket costs reached $6,000. Mr. Gore would pay for all expenses after out-of-pocket costs reached $4,000.</p>
        <p>The drug industry is the second industry that Mr. Gore has gone after in recent weeks, having just finished a series of broadsides against the oil companies. Today, he hailed news that Saudi Arabia was raising oil production and called on the ''big oil companies'' to pass along price reductions.</p>
