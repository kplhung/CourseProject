        <p>The Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed Mexico since 1929, was formed to bring order out of the chaos of the Mexican Revolution.</p>
        <p>Its hallmarks were an iron hand, military discipline, and total control wielded by a maximum leader, the president. It used political force and fraud to win elections, from the smallest mayoralty to the presidency.</p>
        <p>It became a machine assembled to keep itself in power, many Mexican and American historians say. By the 1990's, the party had been in power for so long that it became indistinguishable from power itself.</p>
        <p>An endless succession of new presidents -- each chosen by the previous one -- made the government, the party and the president synonymous. This process of choosing the new leaders was called ''el dedazo'' --  tapping the candidate -- and Mexicans joked bitterly that they lived under ''dedazocracy,'' not democracy.</p>
        <p>Without the presidency and its perquisites, which traditionally included millions of dollars in political funds, the party is a machine without its engine, its fuel, its oil and grease.</p>
        <p>''The party had become a mindless tool of the president,'' said John Bailey, a professor of government at Georgetown University in Washington. ''What held it together was winning.''</p>
        <p>Now the presidency is lost, and the party may be lost without it. Out of power, the party may fly apart, break into factions and cease to exist in its present form, Mr. Bailey said.</p>
        <p>Historians often point out that the name of the Institutional Revolutionary Party contains a contradiction. The party's many critics say it has lost its old political ideals and simply become an institution.</p>
        <p>But in the first half of its life, from the 1930's into the 1960's, the party's ideals were alive. The PRI, as it is called, created something out of nothing: it made modern Mexico. It built roads, schools, hospitals and libraries. It gave land to the poor. It nationalized Mexico's oil. It gave power to labor unions and money to peasant groups and received loyalty in return. Through the 1960's, Mexicans had a stable economy and a strong peso, though millions remained dirt poor.</p>
        <p>The party made a peaceful transition from military rule to civilian power in the 1930's. Ever since, Mexico has been free of the military coups and dictatorships that have made life miserable in so many Latin American nations.</p>
        <p>A turning point came, though, when the government turned its guns on protesting students in 1968 in the Mexico City neighborhood of Tlatelolco. Hundreds died. Mexicans today compare the massacre to the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. What happened in Tlatelolco is still shrouded in official secrecy. But it left millions of Mexicans believing that the governing party would use violence, rather than voluntary reform, to preserve its power.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, when President Jose Lopez Portillo ran the economy aground and nationalized the banks, his missteps gave rise to the National Action Party, which began winning elections across Mexico. That led to a pattern of apparent election fraud by the governing party.</p>
        <p>When a mysterious computer breakdown appeared to alter the results of the 1988 presidential elections, giving victory to the governing party, millions more came to believe that it would steal an election to stay in power.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's, political killings, an economic crisis and a succession of corruption cases suggested that the old order in the party was decaying. In 1994, its presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, appeared to break with the old guard, including President Carlos Salinas, promising sweeping reforms that would separate the party from the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colosio was assassinated on the campaign trail, a killing whose intellectual authorship remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>His campaign manager, Ernesto Zedillo, received the dedazo from President Salinas. He would be the last so chosen. To the praise of all but the party stalwarts, he ended the dedazo and consolidated political and electoral changes that opened up the system. Those reforms led on Sunday to the cleanest election in Mexican history, the National Action Party's victory and the governing party's defeat.</p>
        <p>Election returns and polling data suggest that millions of young, educated and globally minded Mexicans voted against the party in the belief that the nation would never be a modern democracy while in the grip of the party's old guard.</p>
        <p>And no less an authority than Mr. Colosio seemed to have believed that something sinister thrived behind the closed doors of the old leadership.</p>
        <p>According to the historian Enrique Krauze's definitive ''Mexico: Biography of Power'' (HarperCollins, 1997), Mr. Colosio was asked shortly before his death what he thought of President Salinas and his circle.</p>
        <p>''Have you seen 'The Godfather?' '' he replied.</p>
