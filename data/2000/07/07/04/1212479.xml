        <p>Music to Hail A First Lady</p>
        <p>So now HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (the first lady, not the United States Senate candidate) has a march. CAPT. KENNETH R. FORCE, the director of music at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., composed it last month.

        <p>Music to Hail A First Lady</p>
        <p>So now HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (the first lady, not the United States Senate candidate) has a march. CAPT. KENNETH R. FORCE, the director of music at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., composed it last month. ''The nation's first lady,'' it begins, ''a symbol to our land of grace and dedication, of hope to all at hand.''</p>
        <p>The piece began as a tribute to ''all the first ladies from Martha Washington to the present time,'' he said, not as an endorsement of her Senate campaign. When asked what he thought of Mrs. Clinton, he sidestepped the question. ''I'm a federal employee,'' he said. ''I like working. I've been here 31 years and would like to play at the next presidential inauguration.''</p>
        <p>He said he composed the march for the Merchant Marine Academy's graduation ceremony last month, which Mrs. Clinton attended. ''I tried to find appropriate music to play,'' he said. ''There is no music that I know of specifically for the first lady. There's the 'Hail to the Chief' for the president, and 'The Red, White and Blue' or 'Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean' for the vice president.''</p>
        <p>Finding the right music was not the only thing on Captain Force's mind. ''I hope, honestly, it will lead to a president coming here,'' he said, adding that the Merchant Marine Academy was alone among such institutions: no president has ever attended a graduation there. As for the march, Mrs. Clinton clapped along and told him after the ceremony that  she had liked what she heard. ''Maybe,'' he said, ''she liked it so much she'd want to return and bring the president.''</p>
        <p>Knot Waits Years for the Tying</p>
        <p>NORMAN SIEGEL, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a frequent critic of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, married SARALEE EVANS, a civil court judge. JUSTICE EMILY JANE GOODMAN officiated at the ceremony in their apartment on the Upper West Side and, the bridegroom said, ''made a little fun of the state having to approve our relationship, which I appreciated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel and Ms. Evans have lived together for more than 20 years. Why marry now? ''When people ask me why I waited so long,'' Mr. Siegel said, ''I tell them this should dispel any rumors that I'm a knee-jerk personality. As the Supreme Court said, I made my decision with all deliberate speed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Evans's son, MATTHEW, and her daughter, RACHEL, who are in their 30's, had something to do with the timing. ''The reason we got married is they're now having children,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''Saralee told me, so I'm repeating hearsay here, that Rachel said she didn't want to have to explain to her child our nonmarital status. So interesting how the next generation is perhaps a little more conservative on social issues than the 60's children.''</p>
        <p>The Flight Of the Comet</p>
        <p>The actress OLIVIA de HAVILLAND turned 84 over the weekend as she reminisced about another de Havilland, the one who put his name on the world's first jet airliner 51 years ago.</p>
        <p>Miss de Havilland, who played Melanie Wilkes in the 1939 film ''Gone With the Wind,'' was in Hertford, England, at a groundbreaking ceremony at the University of Hertford, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>During the ceremony, she cut a cake in the shape of an Oscar.</p>
        <p>The new campus is being named for her cousin, Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, whose company built the pioneering airliner, the Comet, nearby. The campus is scheduled to open in 2003 on land near the factory.</p>
        <p>''I knew Sir Geoffrey well and he was a brilliant man and a very human one,'' Miss de Havilland said.</p>
        <p>''I think that he would have welcomed with enthusiasm the concept of a campus rising on the land from which his airplanes flew,'' she said.</p>
