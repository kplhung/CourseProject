        <p>When I spotted my new patient in the psychiatry ward in the small hours of the morning, she was in the custody of two police officers and was naked except for a toga made of brightly flowered sheets.</p>
        <p>I instantly knew the diagnosis. When the patient informed me irritably that she was a famous European artist, I thought to myself, ''Right, and I'm Georgia O'Keeffe doing my night job.'' I completed a perfunctory history and physical, gave the orders for medication, and wrote up my summary: mania characterized by delusions of grandiosity, impaired judgment, sleeplessness, irritability. Then I went to bed.</p>
        <p>Several hours later, I found my new patient angrily snapping photos with a disposable camera given to her by the occupational therapist. She was clicking away at us through the glass partition of the nurses' station and shouting at us to call her agent. The head nurse rolled her eyes as we proceeded with morning rounds.</p>
        <p>At 9 a.m., however, the daily routine came to a grinding halt. The phone lines in the nurses' station all lit up simultaneously and my beeper went into its equivalent of intractable seizure activity. An ambassador, two lawyers (one on each side of the Atlantic), the agent and a non-English-speaking psychiatrist all urgently needed to talk to me, the admitting psychiatrist, about the care of the new patient.</p>
        <p>It quickly emerged that the patient was, in fact, a famous artist. Her ''grandiose'' version of her life was correct and my scribbled version of her story had been, in part, wrong. She was indeed manic and in need of hospitalization and medication. She was not, however, psychotic and delusional.</p>
        <p>For me, it was an early lesson in a complex but pervasive problem in psychiatry. It can be frustrating and, at times, nigh impossible, to sort out where ''reality'' lies in the no man's land between the patient's preconceptions and distortions of reality and those of the therapist. In the strange, delicate, dyadic relationship between patient and therapist, the events of the outside world can become surprisingly elusive.</p>
        <p>In some contexts, distortions are an inevitable and even productive part of the therapeutic process. There are areas of insight-oriented therapy, for example, where exact historical truth is neither attainable nor necessary. It has become widely accepted by psychotherapists that a patient's narrative of her past is constructed in the present and therefore necessarily influenced by it. The remembered past is in constant flux.</p>
        <p>In many situations, however, an accurate assessment of the patient's life is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment. With the manic artist, outside sources of information were all too abundant. By the end of her first day in the ward, the place was a circus. The horde of visitors had supplied us with ample information about her life.</p>
        <p>But with many patients such crucial data are in short supply. The situation is particularly perilous for the therapist when information is not just distorted, but omitted. Patients may consciously wish to deny or hide aspects of their lives. More commonly, they simply do not see the elided area as important or problematic.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most common and worrisome omission in psychotherapy is information about alcohol abuse. I learned this the hard way when I first began my practice. An internist called to ask me how I was handling the severe alcohol abuse of the patient he had referred to me. Three months into therapy, the patient was happily exploring memories of her narcissistic father, and I had no notion that he was an alcoholic.</p>
        <p>For the patient as well as for the therapist, bringing outside sources of information into the therapeutic dialogue can add useful new vantage points and can often overturn prior assumptions and beliefs. It can be information from family members or physicians; it can be patients' year-end work evaluations, or even their old report cards.</p>
        <p>After the artist was discharged, she provided the hospital staff with just such a new, outside vantage, but it was one from which to view our own therapeutic world. She sent a photo to hang in the ward.</p>
        <p>The image is one that I often recall when I am forcibly brought up against the limits of psychotherapy. In the picture, the ward staff sits huddled over a table surrounded by the plexiglass bubble of the nurse's station. A pale reflection of the patient stares back from the surface of the glass.</p>
