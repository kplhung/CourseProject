        <p>A forthcoming biography of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says that the mayor's father, Harold Giuliani, served a year and a half in state prison for robbing a milk deliveryman.</p>
        <p>According to the book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, the elder Giuliani pulled a gun on the milkman in 1934 in the corridor of a building on East 96th Street and, with an accomplice, robbed him of $128.82.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett is a reporter for The Village Voice. The book, which is to be published Monday by Basic Books, was excerpted on the Voice's Web site yesterday.</p>
        <p>Harold Giuliani, who later owned a bar and grill in Brooklyn, was sentenced to two to five years at Sing Sing Correctional Facility and served a year and a half, the book states.</p>
        <p>The mayor, through his chief spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment on the account.</p>
        <p>''He has not read it,'' she said. ''He has no plans to read it. He has no comment on it.'' Asked specifically if the report was true, Ms. Mindel again would not answer. A longtime aide of the mayor also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Officials in the Correction Department and the district attorney's office could not be reached last evening.</p>
        <p>The elder Giuliani died in 1981.</p>
