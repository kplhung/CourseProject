        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your June 29 news article about graduation ceremonies for preschoolers, an early-childhood educator says: ''We can't just throw them into a new environment. We have to tell them they are ready for it, they are going to succeed.''</p>
        <p>A child's ability to succeed is not based on one big day of fanfare. A child's level of self-confidence is something that develops over time with the help of loving, nurturing family members and qualified professionals who realize what is developmentally appropriate for preschoolers.</p>
        <p>What's important is that a preschool's philosophy include the acceptance of everyone regardless of ability. Preschool is about making sure that children learn how to feel good about themselves; how to be a good friend; how to take turns; and to remember to use the words ''please'' and ''thank you'' whenever possible.</p>
        <p>HELAYNE COHEN  Highland Park, Ill., June 29, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a preschool teacher.</p>
