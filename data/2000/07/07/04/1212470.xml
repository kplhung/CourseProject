        <p>The wicked edges that typically mark the corners of Martina Hingis's mischievous Garfield smile suddenly vanished. At the mention of Venus and Serena Williams today, Hingis was less biting and all but cuddly as she unveiled a humble front.</p>
        <p>She was respectful and complimentary and credited both sculpted sisters for pointing her in the direction of the gym. Just after Hingis advanced to the quarterfinals by dismantling a beleaguered Anke Huber, 6-1, 6-2, she refused a chance to snip at the Williams sisters, fully aware of her predicament.</p>
        <p>To reach the Wimbledon final, she will have to escape the sling-blade ground strokes of Venus Williams in the quarterfinals and potentially Serena in the semifinals. With straight-set victories in the Round of 16 as a kick start to the second week of Wimbledon, Serena and Venus Williams began closing in on Hingis like walls in a claustrophobic nightmare.</p>
        <p>''You're happy you make it through one of them,'' Hingis said. ''And then the next day, the other one is waiting. Hopefully, if I can beat one, I'll get a day off. Definitely they're not easy, but anything is possible.''</p>
        <p>Usually, Hingis fancies herself too clever on the court to be vulnerable, but after Venus Williams drained her during a three-set semifinal at the United States Open and Serena Williams finished her off in the final last year, her increasingly fragile confidence was cracked in half. So although Hingis is No. 1 in the world, she could not have been surprised at the response Venus Williams gave when reminded of her next opponent's top ranking.</p>
        <p>''So what?'' the elder Williams said.</p>
        <p>It was not a day for the American to show any fear. Although she had to overcome the current reincarnation of her fellow hard-hitting countrywoman, Jennifer Capriati, Lindsay Davenport pummeled the lines in a 6-3, 6-3 victory on Center Court. Joining Davenport and the Williams sisters to form a quarterfinal assembled by Uncle Sam, Monica Seles and Lisa Raymond also advanced.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it is,'' Serena Williams said. ''Maybe it's McDonald's. Definitely their cheeseburgers. Not too much the fries, but the cheeseburgers, yeah.''</p>
        <p>There was a fast-food feel to the day. Wasting little time, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras pulled away with their fourth-round matches in straight sets. And Jan-Michael Gambill, the giddy, effusive American once billed as the next Agassi or Sampras, finally greeted high expectations with a karate-like kick and a pumped fist when he advanced to his first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam event with a 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 upset of ninth-seeded Thomas Enqvist.</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old Gambill eliminated the last seeded player in Sampras's half of the draw, and became the next opponent for the top-seeded Sampras.</p>
        <p>Moving freely with tendinitis in his lower left shin and uncoiling his body to hit 17 aces, Sampras oozed health. That image only fed into the skepticism around what some of Sampras's peers are referring to as his ''so-called injury.''</p>
        <p>''They can believe or read what they want to read,'' Sampras said. ''It's still two guys playing out there.''</p>
        <p>After match point, Sampras felt as if he had a brush with such a skeptic when his opponent, Jonas Bjorkman, barely shook his hand.</p>
        <p>''I could tell by the way Jonas shook my hand today that, you know, he was thinking whatever he thinks,'' Sampras said. ''For the first time, the pressure is kind of on my opponent a little bit. They know I'm a little bit injured. The pressure is on them. They're not liking it.''</p>
        <p>Bjorkman described his limp handshake as merely a sign of his disappointment with losing but side-stepped the issue of Sampras's health.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if he's faking it or not,'' Bjorkman said. ''I just go out and be prepared to play a guy who has been dominating Wimbledon for the last seven years.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, Sampras has been viewed as a drama major when injured. Slumped-shouldered by nature, he once punctuated his bedraggled appearance when he became physically ill on the court during the 1996 United States Open. At the time, John McEnroe and Jim Courier reportedly said Sampras was faking it.</p>
        <p>''Usually when it's a tough moment, I kind of carry it in my pocket, the vomit,'' Sampras said when reminded of McEnroe's and Courier's comments. Then Sampras smiled a little more when he was asked why so many doubt him. Could it be envy over his ability to play hurt?</p>
        <p>''We have to go, don't we?'' Sampras said as he left the interview room. ''Cry me a river.''</p>
        <p>However painful his shin, Sampras's chase of a record 13th Grand Slam men's singles title has the potential to overshadow the women. But on Tuesday, with a women's-only day of singles to showcase the quarterfinals, the attention will be on Hingis and Venus Williams, as well as another intriguing match between the second-seeded Davenport and a fit Seles. Playing as a survivor of a sometimes emotionally difficult and tragic career, Seles believes she still has a shot at a Wimbledon title that has always eluded her.</p>
        <p>''Right now, I can't say I'm a shade below the top players because I'm playing one of them tomorrow,'' Seles said. ''That's would be a terrible way to go into the match. But up to this moment, I'd have to say I'm probably behind. Martina and Lindsay have beaten me the last couple of times I've played them.''</p>
        <p>Today, Hingis, who has bounded through the tournament with ease, appeared a step ahead of Venus Williams. In her match against Appelmans, Williams had to persevere through 12 deuces before slamming a forehand winner to break Appelmans's serve in the first game of the second set. Williams was not displeased with the 6-4, 6-4 outcome, but she was not happy about how she has allowed her last couple of opponents second chances.</p>
        <p>''It really is annoying,'' Williams said. ''But I can raise the level of my game. I just have to get my mind there. There's no way these girls should be competing like that against me in these sets, unless, of course, I let them.''</p>
        <p>Hingis will search for any crack. She is quick to exploit the weaknesses of her opponent and sneak inside her head by chasing down every point. In 53 minutes, she picked apart the psyche of the 11th-seeded Huber's by staying in every point and breaking her opponent's serve on 7 of 11 chances. For now, her confidence is beneath the surface. If she believes she can take the Williams sisters, she was not letting on.</p>
        <p>''When they came into women's tennis, with a lot more power and physical abilities, everybody had to improve,'' said Hingis, who holds a 9-5 lead in head-to-head matchups with Venus Williams. ''So I had to improve. I feel very good. Now the tournament begins.''</p>
