        <p>The cost of watching the latest Mel Gibson or George Clooney blockbuster has not risen much in the last year. But the price of a night at the movies for New Yorkers is mounting, mainly because the price of soda and popcorn has shot up an average of 6 percent citywide, according to an annual survey of movie theaters across the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>The cost of that night out for a family of four rose an average of 3 percent in the last year, to $38.90 from $37.69, according to a city Department of Consumer Affairs survey of 78 theaters, which was conducted in May and released yesterday.</p>

        <p>The cost of watching the latest Mel Gibson or George Clooney blockbuster has not risen much in the last year. But the price of a night at the movies for New Yorkers is mounting, mainly because the price of soda and popcorn has shot up an average of 6 percent citywide, according to an annual survey of movie theaters across the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>The cost of that night out for a family of four rose an average of 3 percent in the last year, to $38.90 from $37.69, according to a city Department of Consumer Affairs survey of 78 theaters, which was conducted in May and released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ticket prices increased only 2 percent across the city, to an average of $8.58 for one adult ticket and $5.50 for the elderly. But prices for snacks rose more steeply. In Manhattan, for example, popcorn and soda prices  were up 7 percent.</p>
        <p>The study found that a 32-ounce soda cost $3.01 at a theater, compared with $1.72 at a local McDonald's. A 4-ounce bag of M&amp;M's that sold for $1.05 at Duane Reade was $2.96 in the theater, the survey found.</p>
        <p>Jane S. Hoffman, the consumer affairs commissioner, who released the results, said moviegoers have two solutions: eat before going to the movies and compare prices at theaters, even those near one another.</p>
        <p>''If you move four blocks you can save $5,'' Ms. Hoffman said, noting that a family of four would pay $41 for tickets and snacks at the Angelika Film Center on West Houston Street but $36.05 at Film Forum just a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>The annual survey has irked theater operators, who have long noted the high cost of operating in New York, especially in Manhattan. They contend that going to the movies remains an affordable form of entertainment at a time when prices for sporting events and other attractions have risen sharply.</p>
        <p>Marc J. Pascucci, senior vice president of marketing for Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which operates theaters with a third of the city's movie screens, said his company had invested heavily in Manhattan in the last year, opening up multiscreen theaters on 32nd Street and in Times Square that helped revitalize those areas.</p>
        <p>''We are a good company doing business in a big city, a big, expensive city, and for two hours-plus of solid entertainment we offer a good value,'' Mr. Pascucci said.</p>
        <p>Elliott Kanbar, owner of Quad Cinema on West 13th Street, which is known for its independent and foreign films, said that moviegoers do not have to nibble on popcorn and drink soda to enjoy a night at the movies. In fact, Mr. Kanbar said, film buffs who frequent his theater, which he has owned for 27 years, tend to forgo concessions.</p>
        <p>Still, having a movie -- and your popcorn, too -- does not need to be prohibitively expensive for a family, the survey found.</p>
        <p>At the Canarsie Triplex at Avenue L and East 93rd Street in Brooklyn, the cheapest theater surveyed, the owner, Joe Silverstone, lowered ticket prices from $7 to $5 last year. Because popcorn and sodas are also  cheaper there than in many other movie houses, a family of four can spend less than $25 in an evening, about $15 less than at most Manhattan theaters, and still see first-run movies like ''The Perfect Storm.''</p>
        <p>''People are trying to save money; they work hard and they don't have money,'' said Andrzej Jeglinski, the manager. ''Here, they're paying $20, $25 for a movie and popcorn and candy. People see that, and they're coming.''</p>
        <p>SURVEY  Moviegoing: The Cheapest and Costliest</p>
        <p>The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs surveyed movie theater prices to determine which theaters were the most and least expensive in each borough. The survey counted the total costs of tickets for two adults and two children, a large popcorn and two medium sodas.</p>
        <p>The survey results are to be posted later this week at www.nyc.gov/consumers.</p>
