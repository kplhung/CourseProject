        <p>Austria's frustration over European Union sanctions, which had largely degenerated into a long-distance cat fight between Austria and France, led over the weekend to threats to block European expansion.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of Austria said today that the sanctions would have to be lifted before the 15-member European Union could admit any new countries. Approval of any of the dozen countries seeking admission must be unanimous, and other reforms are planned for December, so Austria could play spoiler if it does not get its way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schussel's remarks echoed some made earlier today by Jorg Haider, the dominant figure in Austria's rightist Freedom Party, which is in a coalition government with Mr. Schussel's party.</p>
        <p>The sanctions were imposed last February, to punish the country for letting Mr. Haider's party into government. The party opposes immigration, and some charge that it is racist and xenophobic. Mr. Haider, a popular governor of a southern province, is best known for making several offhand remarks in the past that seemed to defend the Third Reich.</p>
        <p>The sanctions have had no serious economic effect on Austria and amount to a refusal by cabinet ministers from 14 European countries to meet publicly with their Austrian counterparts. But the sanctions rankle with Austrians.</p>
        <p>In elections last October, running on an anti-big-government platform, Mr. Haider's Freedom Party got 26.9 percent of the vote, ending in a virtual tie with Mr. Schussel's People's Party. After negotiations broke down between Mr. Schussel and the Social Democrats, which had the largest percentage of votes, he formed a government with the Freedom Party. Many Austrians are openly infuriated that other countries, led by France and Belgium, felt that they could punish a fellow country that -- in the eyes of those Austrians -- had done nothing illegal or anti-democratic.</p>
        <p>The issue has been simmering since the sanctions were imposed five months ago, but flared again over the weekend, when France took over the rotating presidency of the European Union. Both Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and President Jacques Chirac, putting aside their usual snide disagreements with each other, said they did not expect the sanctions to be lifted this year.</p>
        <p>In a response today, Mr. Haider  said on Austrian national radio: ''Now that France has said nothing will change during the French presidency, we say quite bluntly that nothing will move either.'' And, with his habitually unguarded tongue, he said France, as president, would find itself ''a noisy giant, like Gulliver, held in chains by many dwarfs, unable to move.''</p>
        <p>The Austrian government is making plans to hold a referendum in October asking voters how they feel about the sanctions. Mr. Schussel recently dropped his objection to the idea.</p>
        <p>Last month, European Union officials suggested a face-saving way out of the quandary created when the union applied the sanctions with little warning and virtually no public debate. A group of ''three wise men'' appointed by the European Court of Human Rights would examine the human rights record of Austria and the Freedom Party, particularly on immigration matters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schussel said Austria would cooperate. The country has strong laws against espousing Nazi ideals and virtually no recent history of racist, anti-Semitic or neo-Nazi violence. It has also, he contended, accepted more refugees per capita than any other country.</p>
        <p>He did ask that the court's inquiry be finished by September. Today, Mr. Chirac declined to set a deadline, saying, ''It's up to them to take the necessary time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider has complained that submitting his party to an inspection of its political correctness is insulting.</p>
        <p>Other Austrians have pointed out that France has a tarnished record on its treatment of immigrants and minorities and that it also has a xenophobic political party. And they say that Germany and Britain have many more violent neo-Nazi incidents and that Austria's immigration policies are in line with policies of other European Union members even though it is especially vulnerable because it borders on impoverished Eastern Europe.</p>
