        <p>Around the gym here, 17-year-old Cheryl Haworth goes by the nickname Fun. She merrily sings a ''Simpsons'' ditty about our most ineffective presidents, rattles off the polysyllabic names of the body's most obscure muscles, knows most of ''The Raven'' by heart and is an award-winning artist whose lifelike drawings resemble photographs.</p>
        <p>Not yet a senior in high school, Haworth is also the best American hope, man or woman, for an Olympic medal in weight lifting at the Summer Games in September, and she has picked up two phrases of Chinese that may help in communicating with her top competition in Sydney, Australia. The problem is, she learned the words from television's most irreverent character, Bart Simpson, who taught her to say, ''Here are your eyes, sir,'' and ''You can never have enough slave laborers.''</p>
        <p>So maybe this is not exactly in keeping with the Olympic spirit of international brotherhood. She might as well slip a whoopee cushion to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the Olympic president, at the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>''No, I won't be saying those things to anybody,'' Haworth said with a laugh. ''How do you know if they're true? I heard them on 'The Simpsons.' ''</p>
        <p>Women's weight lifting will be a medal sport for the first time in Sydney, and at 5 feet 9 inches and 300 pounds, Haworth will provide a riveting presence in the superheavyweight division with her size, agility, speed, balance and ballistic strength. She took a bronze medal at the 1999 world championships and won a preliminary Olympic event four months ago in Sydney, having deftly translated her raw power into the technique and velocity necessary to succeed in international weight lifting.</p>
        <p>She can run the 40-yard dash in 5.5 seconds, has a 30-inch vertical leap, has the flexibility to do a full split and, from a standing start, jumps on and off wooden boxes standing two and a half feet high to increase the fast-twitch explosiveness in her legs.</p>
        <p>''A lot of football coaches come in here, and I think they would die for someone that fast, flexible and strong,'' said Michael Cohen, Haworth's personal coach, who will also coach the American women in Sydney. ''I've never seen another woman that strong.''</p>
        <p>Beth Haworth, 19, was sitting in a restaurant with her family, urging a visitor to squeeze her sister's arm.</p>
        <p>''Feel her biceps,'' she said.</p>
        <p>If there is one city in which a woman flexing her biceps in a family restaurant would not be considered out of place, it is Savannah, immortalized for its florid eccentricities in the book ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'' A tour group had just trooped through the restaurant, looking for the tunnel that pirates once used to smuggle forced laborers onto ships in the Savannah River.</p>
        <p>''Go ahead, feel,'' Beth Haworth insisted.</p>
        <p>Haworth flexed her left arm, and the muscle was as hard as the restaurant's peach cobbler was soft. Her left arm is the smaller, Haworth said, but the biceps still measures 17 inches in circumference, the same size as the visitor's neck.</p>
        <p>''Now feel her quads,'' Beth Haworth said.</p>
        <p>Haworth flexed her thigh muscles, which felt as sturdy as the moss-draped canopy oaks that tower over Savannah's historic district.</p>
        <p>''Thirty-two inches,'' Beth Haworth said proudly. ''Bigger than my waist.''</p>
        <p>Haworth wears her hair pulled tightly behind her head, and sometimes, she said, people see her wide face and dark features and ask whether she is Samoan. Once, for television cameras, she hoisted her sister overhead as if she were a barbell. Another time, she and a group of friends lifted another friend's car and moved it across a parking lot. People are always asking her to pick them up. On ''The Tonight Show,'' the actor Damon Wayans jumped into her arms.</p>
        <p>Good-naturedly, she declines to lift people when they ask. She is an athlete, not a sideshow performer. Yet she also appears to be extremely comfortable with her size in a society that often demands that women be sliced as thin as corned beef.</p>
        <p>''I know a lot of 17-year-olds don't weigh 300 pounds, but I was never really discouraged because I was so big,'' Haworth said. ''It's who I was, who I am. I knew I wasn't the right size or shape for certain things, but I didn't let it bother me. I decided to look for something else.''</p>
        <p>A sickly child, Haworth had her tonsils and adenoids removed when she was 6, and as she grew healthier, she began to gain weight, says her mother, Sheila, a registered nurse. Sheila Haworth consulted dietitians, but she decided that it was not proper to put a young girl on a diet.</p>
        <p>''When my daughter sits down and says she is still hungry, I'd feed her again,'' Sheila Haworth said. ''I don't want her hating me or for this to be a battleground. I give her fat-free milk at home, fruit, good food. If she's going to be big, she'll be big.''</p>
        <p>At 13, looking to increase her strength for playing softball, Haworth visited the Paul Anderson-Howard Cohen Gym, where Team Savannah, a weight lifting club, does its training. The Haworths are an athletic family. Bob Haworth, the father, played freshman football and wrestled at the University of Nebraska in the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>Haworth always appeared to be strong as a young girl, her father said. She built treehouses in the family's rural neighborhood. ''And she arm-wrestled boys on the bus -- once,'' he said, laughing. But it was her first day in the gym that showed him just how extraordinary her strength could be. Haworth lifted 110 pounds to her chest ''like it was a broomstick,'' said Cohen, who would become her coach.</p>
        <p>His wife, Sheryl Cohen, worked with Haworth for 10 minutes and then reported to him, ''She's the strongest girl I've ever seen.''</p>
        <p>As her weight lifting skills improved, so did her self-confidence, Beth Haworth said.</p>
        <p>''I remember people would pick on her, call her fat, and you could tell her feelings were upset,'' Beth Haworth said. ''Now, I don't think anyone would be caught dead calling her a bad name.''</p>
        <p>Three years after she began lifting, Haworth entered the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg. During the competition, she grabbed the bar with 246 pounds attached and moved it slightly, away from a stationary television camera. The crowd gasped. She won the event. Her coach said a veteran Colombian lifter, Maria Isabel Urrutia, was so inconsolable, she vowed to retire.</p>
        <p>''I quit,'' Urrutia said, according to Cohen. ''I let a 16-year-old beat me.''</p>
        <p>A Healthy 300-Pounder</p>
        <p>In competition, Haworth has lifted 264 pounds in the snatch and 319 in the clean and jerk, the two types of Olympic lifting. This combined weight of 583 pounds is about 20 pounds short of the world record. If she remains with the sport through the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Cohen said, he expects that she will be lifting 700 pounds.</p>
        <p>On an afternoon in early June, Haworth was simply warming up for a state competition the next day. She placed 100 pounds on the bar and snatched it over her head with little effort, then did several lifts with 150 pounds. In a snatch lift, the bar is brought from the floor to overhead in one ballistic motion lasting seven-tenths of a second, which requires remarkable speed, flexibility and balance in getting under the bar, along with tremendous strength in the legs, hips and back.</p>
        <p>''Look at her hamstring,'' Cohen said as Haworth rested in a chair between lifts, the muscle hanging like a hammock on the back of her right leg. ''In a normal person that size, that would be fat. But that is muscle dripping off her leg.''</p>
        <p>In the clean and jerk, the bar is brought first to the shoulders, then propelled over the head with an explosive scissoring of the legs. Speed and position are not as important as in the snatch, but strength is far more important.</p>
        <p>''She's just playing with it,'' Cohen said as Haworth lifted 255 pounds over her head. ''She's never missed a jerk. If she gets it to her chest, she'll get it over her head.''</p>
        <p>Is she in good health at 300 pounds? Yes, said Mike Popson, the head trainer for Team Savannah and the USA Weightlifting. Haworth received a clean bill of health on a thyroid checkup, and while weight increases the risks for diabetes and heart problems, Popson said, Haworth is being monitored. ''She's healthy and strong as an ox, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The staff at Team Savannah would like Haworth to lose some weight eventually, and she will begin working closely with a dietitian, Popson said. As she gets older and continues to train vigorously, Popson and Cohen also expect Haworth to replace some of her body fat with lean muscle. Her only health concern at the moment is a bulging disk in her back -- a chronic weight lifting concern -- for which she receives weekly treatment from a chiropractor.</p>
        <p>Cohen is a former high school health teacher, and he believes that anorexia and bulimia pose a bigger hazard than overeating does for teenage girls. ''Girls are taught that they've got to be under 100 pounds and wafer thin,'' Cohen said. ''That's ridiculous. That's dangerous. If a child is healthy and comfortable, that's what you want. Cheryl says: 'I'm bigger than most people and I don't care. Like me or not for what I am.' If you're not healthy, you're not going to be lifting that kind of weight.''</p>
        <p>Twin Passions</p>
        <p>The Haworths live on the southwestern edge of Savannah, in a bucolic neighborhood that was once the Wild Heron Plantation. Behind the family house in a fenced-in, overgrown area is a slave graveyard. Overlooking the backyard, in her father's home office, is a drawing board at which Haworth excels at her other passion, art.</p>
        <p>In the fourth grade, she stunned her mother with a reproduction of Van Gogh's ''Starry, Starry Night.'' She will be a senior in the fall at the Savannah Arts Academy, and with a pencil drawing of one of her training partners, she recently won first place in a contest sponsored by the Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>
        <p>She has an I.Q. of 135, and like many highly intelligent children, she said she found herself growing unenthusiastic about things that did not interest or challenge her. But art and weight lifting have engrossed her, because she is good at both, because they are alike and because they are different -- one wholly subjective, the other completely objective.</p>
        <p>''They both take a lot of concentration, and technique, and they both force you to finish something,'' Haworth said. ''In weight lifting, you are always improving. It's always structured. You never wonder if you're good or not.''</p>
        <p>In Sydney, she could be good enough to be called the strongest woman in the world.</p>
