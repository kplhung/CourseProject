        <p>A guard at the women's jail on Rikers Island was arrested yesterday and charged with the rape of a 34-year-old inmate on Friday. He was suspended without pay pending the outcome of the case.</p>
        <p>The inmate said the guard, Pablo Rodriguez, 44, of Manhattan, overpowered and raped her in a small staff dining room called the Blue Room, according to officials with the City Department of Investigation and the Department of Correction. The inmate immediately complained, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>The case was turned over to Michael Caruso, the inspector general for the Department of Correction. Mr. Rodriguez turned himself in to Mr. Caruso's office yesterday afternoon. If convicted, he faces up to 25 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The inmate worked in the mess hall of the Rose M. Singer Center, which houses women awaiting trial or serving sentences shorter than a year. Her duties included serving meals to supervisory personnel.</p>
        <p>Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the Department of Correction, said Mr. Rodriguez supervised inmates who worked in the mess hall and the kitchen, which typically generate the most jobs for inmates in the city's jails. He said there was no rule preventing a guard from being alone with an inmate. He also said there was no policy preventing correction officers from working in jails holding inmates of the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>''The only policy that deals with same-sex issues are strip searches,'' he said, meaning officers of one sex cannot strip search inmates of the other sex. ''Otherwise, an officer is an officer is an officer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Antenen said he had no information yet on the job performance record of Mr. Rodriguez, who has been working as a correction officer since 1995 and whose annual salary is $38,052. Mr. Antenen said that Mr. Rodriguez had undergone a criminal background check and psychological evaluation when he was hired.</p>
        <p>Mr. Antenen, who has been with the agency 15 years, said neither he nor anyone he had spoken with could remember a similar case. ''There have been allegations in the past,'' he said, ''but not to the point of someone being arrested. It's very rare.''</p>
