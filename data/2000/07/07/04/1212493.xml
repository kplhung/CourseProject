        <p>Local law enforcement officials were skeptical yesterday that the fan who was arrested for throwing a baseball onto the Shea Stadium outfield near John Rocker would be prosecuted. But prosecutors in Queens said they had not yet reached a decision on the merits of the case.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the police charged Gregory Sweeney, 25, of Prospect Heights in Brooklyn, with second-degree reckless endangerment after he threw back to the grass a ball Rocker had tossed into the stands. Rocker, who had been warming up left fielder Reggie Sanders, had left the field before the ball landed in the outfield. It did not land near any other player.</p>
        <p>Under the state penal code, second-degree reckless endangerment is any ''conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person.'' It carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison.</p>
        <p>But some police officers quietly scoffed at the charge yesterday, saying the arresting officer had mistaken for a crime an action that clearly resembled the baseball tradition of throwing back a visiting team's home runs as a sign of disgust. They also noted that Sweeney had been handed the ball by a police captain that it had accidentally struck, and, as he held it, fans were chanting for him to unload it. The ball landed harmlessly in the outfield.</p>
        <p>''Rocker was already out of the way when the ball came down,'' one police supervisor said. ''It wasn't even near him.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at City Hall yesterday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the Police Department, saying that it had handled with great skill the security issues surrounding Rocker, who antagonized people across the country with remarks in Sports Illustrated last year about members of minority groups, gays, single mothers and foreigners.</p>
        <p>But even Giuliani, a former prosecutor, suggested that the charge might not hold up.</p>
        <p>''It is understandable that if a ball came down on the field in a situation like that, they arrest the person who threw it and then have to sort it out afterwards,'' the mayor said. ''If it turns out to have an innocent explanation, it will work out.''</p>
        <p>For the moment, the fate of the charge rests with Richard Brown, the Queens Country District Attorney. Brown's office said yesterday that it had gathered footage of Sweeney's toss and had not decided how to proceed.</p>
        <p>''We're going to review our videotapes and make the decisions accordingly,'' said Sherry Hunter, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Because Sweeney was issued a desk appearance ticket, he is not expected in court for about a month. And another official said that before Sweeney appears, the prosecutors will probably drop the charge.</p>
        <p>''It would appear that the criminal activity, if any, was minimal,'' the official said. ''But we do have an obligation to review it.''</p>
        <p>Sweeney did not return two phone messages yesterday.</p>
