        <p>Editorial hails fact that in Mexico, presidential power will be passing peacefully to opposition party for first time in living memory; credits outgoing Pres Ernesto Zedillo for giving Mexico its cleanest election ever, and calls on him to make further contribution by working closely with his successor, Vicente Fox Quesada, through crucial months ahead</p>

        <p>Never before in the memory of living Mexicans has presidential power passed peacefully to an opposition party.

        <p>Never before in the memory of living Mexicans has presidential power passed peacefully to an opposition party. But just such a transition is now under way, following the decisive victory of Vicente Fox Quesada and his center-right National Action Party, or PAN, in Sunday's Mexican elections. It is a great advance for democracy in Latin America's second-largest country and Washington's second-biggest trading partner.</p>
        <p>Mexico began prying lose the authoritarian grip of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, more than a decade ago, as its citizens came into contact with the democratic currents sweeping Latin America and the world. Initial electoral challenges were repulsed by intimidation and fraud, or bought off with patronage. But opposition parties persisted, and during the six-year term of President Ernesto Zedillo important reforms opened up the electoral system. Statehouses fell to opposition governors. Three years ago the combined opposition won a congressional majority. That allowed scrutiny of the federal budget and cabinet ministers. But Mexico's Constitution concentrates power in the presidency. Its passage into opposition hands is a transforming event in the political life of Mexico.</p>
        <p>Mexico's transition toward a modern democracy also has significance for the United States. No major policy differences divide Mr. Fox's PAN from the long-ruling PRI. But the inauguration of democratic competition at every level of Mexican politics can have a salutary effect on a wide range of issues. It can provide a check on official corruption in Mexico and mitigate the feelings of political and economic powerlessness that have driven so many Mexicans to emigrate illegally to the United States. Some officials in Washington may miss the predictability of permanent rule by the PRI. But wiser heads will see the positive potential in this week's change.</p>
        <p>Besides winning the presidency, the PAN will also be the largest party in the Congress. But to command a majority, it will have to make deals with other political groups. This need for a broadly based government should prove healthy, encouraging the PAN to reach out to members of the center-left opposition as well as the PRI.</p>
        <p>Catholic intellectuals formed the PAN more than 60 years ago to fight the secularism and land reform programs of Mexico's post-revolutionary governments. More recently, the PAN has evolved into a moderate pro-business party, well represented by Mr. Fox, a former chief executive of Coca-Cola in Mexico. In building his victory margin, Mr. Fox attracted considerable support from left-of-center voters, many of whom felt that ending the PRI's enduring grip on the presidency was the most important issue in this year's election.</p>
        <p>The PRI, associated with so many electoral manipulations in the past, behaved wisely and  responsibly in defeat. Its candidate, Francisco  Labastida Ochoa, conceded early and gracefully, getting the lengthy five-month transition period  off to a firm start. The PRI's constructive new attitude owes much to Mr. Zedillo's enlightened leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo correctly understood that the only way to restore public confidence in elections was to create an independent electoral institute to supervise campaigning, balloting and the tallying of votes. Without that crucial reform, this year's generally clean campaign and Sunday's reliable count might not have been possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox will not take office until Dec. 1. Past presidential transitions have been marred by economic turmoil. In 1994, the administration of Carlos Salinas failed to coordinate its financial policies with Mr. Zedillo's incoming team, badly undermining international confidence in the peso. The result was a painful recession, which cost Mexicans dearly. Mr. Zedillo should draw the appropriate lesson from that experience. Having given Mexico its cleanest election ever, he can make a further contribution by working closely with Mr. Fox and his advisers through the crucial months ahead.</p>
