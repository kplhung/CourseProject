        <p>About 100 miles west of London, Cheltenham grew up two centuries ago as a spa town, for which purpose it acquired fine public buildings, a few comfortable hotels and street after street of modestly handsome houses faced with honey-colored stone from the local Cotswolds. Behind those regular, flat facades it would be easy to imagine families of Jane Austen characters who have arrived to take the curative waters, stroll in the parks and dance with young officers. Now, though, the place has to find other ways to attract visitors and to serve its permanent population, which includes a high proportion of retired people.</p>
        <p>Hence its festivals, among which the music festival is the oldest and most distinguished, having been started right after World War II. This year's program is typical. The opening weekend included a recital by Alfred Brendel, an orchestral concert, and chamber-music mornings with young and established ensembles. It also included the world premiere of an opera based on a classic novel, not one of the Austen books that might have suited the location (if not the operatic form), but rather Charlotte Bronte's ''Jane Eyre.''</p>

        <p>About 100 miles west of London, Cheltenham grew up two centuries ago as a spa town, for which purpose it acquired fine public buildings, a few comfortable hotels and street after street of modestly handsome houses faced with honey-colored stone from the local Cotswolds. Behind those regular, flat facades it would be easy to imagine families of Jane Austen characters who have arrived to take the curative waters, stroll in the parks and dance with young officers. Now, though, the place has to find other ways to attract visitors and to serve its permanent population, which includes a high proportion of retired people.</p>
        <p>Hence its festivals, among which the music festival is the oldest and most distinguished, having been started right after World War II. This year's program is typical. The opening weekend included a recital by Alfred Brendel, an orchestral concert, and chamber-music mornings with young and established ensembles. It also included the world premiere of an opera based on a classic novel, not one of the Austen books that might have suited the location (if not the operatic form), but rather Charlotte Bronte's ''Jane Eyre.''</p>
        <p>This was a second opera for the British composer Michael Berkeley and his librettist, the Australian novelist David Malouf. Like their first -- ''Baa Baa Black Sheep,'' based on episodes from the life and writings of Rudyard Kipling -- ''Jane Eyre'' is an attempt to use late-20th-century means to understand the minds and situations of Victorian characters. The mixed perspectives suit Mr. Berkeley's music, which sometimes consorts with the 19th century (even to the extent, unwisely, of quoting liberally from the mad scene in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'') and sometimes sounds resiliently contemporary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malouf concentrates the capacious narrative into a compact and fluid psychological drama for Jane and the Rochester couple, with their housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax and the ward Adele on the fringes. He makes it possible for the central characters to be present almost throughout, often seen when they are not heard (Mrs. Rochester pacing in the attic of the set) or heard when they are not seen (Jane disturbed by words from Rochester that he will not utter directly to her).</p>
        <p>One big problem is that the resulting atmosphere of unease, and of an outsider's gradual recognition of malignancy within a household, brings the opera close to two models it cannot match. A scene from Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' is closely recalled when Jane questions Adele. More generally the piece evokes Britten's ''Turn of the Screw,'' not only in its subject but in its scoring for a few voices with a chamber orchestra of soloists.</p>
        <p>While he cannot come near Britten in expressing sinister erotic appeal,  Mr. Berkeley is good at murky scene-setting, as in the opening low glissando figures, and at moments of exasperation, like the passage where Rochester's baritone seems to be pushed up and tightened by an insistent piccolo. But continuity is lacking, and the final catastrophe comes suddenly out of nowhere.</p>
        <p>Nor does the main musical tension serve the subject. When the instrumental weave is broken by percussion sounds, the effect is not so much to suggest the hedonism and otherness of the Rochesters' Caribbean existence as to hint, rather wistfully, at an opera ''Jane Eyre'' is not: an opera cut loose from period costume and waltz tunes. Perhaps Mr. Berkeley's and Mr. Malouf's next enterprise, ''A Winter's Tale,'' will be that piece.</p>
        <p>The performance, by Music Theater Wales, was up to this company's high standards, with Michael Rafferty conducting and Michael McCarthy directing. Natasha Marsh provided everything the title role needed: a strong but quiet beautiful presence, sensitive acting and a finely handled lyric soprano voice. Also excellent were Andrew Slater as Rochester, Emily Bauer-Jones as Mrs. Rochester and Tabitha Watling as Adele.</p>
