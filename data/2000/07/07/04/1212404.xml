        <p>Facts of Life for Whales</p>
        <p>Q.  Is a third whale involved in positioning whales for mating?</p>
        <p>A.  In some whale species, a third whale may have a role in courtship, but it is now thought to involve competition, not assistance.</p>
        <p>The California gray whale, Eschrichtius robustus, has many more males than females, according to ''Gray Whales'' by David G. Gordon and Alan Baldridge (Monterey Bay Aquarium Press). ''Two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that remain intact right up to the moment of conception,'' the book says. The cow slows down, signaling a willingness to mate, and the bulls use their flippers to slow her down even more. The bulls swim upside down beside her, each trying to mate. When one succeeds in rotating his underside alongside that of the cow, copulation occurs.</p>
        <p>There was some speculation that an extra male, or males, held the mating pair together to brace them for mating. However, Mr. Baldridge said, this idea is now mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is difficult to study. A female may have multiple partners, ''but the relationship between the males is one of competition, not collaboration,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As for getting into position to mate, Mr. Baldridge said, the female usually floats rightside up and the male comes up from below. ''What you do see in mating whales is a lot of rolling around,'' he said, ''and if a female does not wish to mate, she will roll belly up.''</p>
