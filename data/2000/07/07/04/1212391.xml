        <p>Last February a friend and I (both 60-ish women who walk about three miles every morning) flew to Tucson for a week of hiking. We went prepared with sunscreen, sun-blocking shirts and hats, several water bottles each and a first-aid kit in our backpacks, plus an ample supply of ibuprofen just in case.</p>
        <p>Each morning before heading for the hills we filled sealable plastic bags with orange and grapefruit sections for rest-stop refreshment. After a substantial breakfast of cereal and fruit and a vigorous morning hike of about four hours, a light lunch of soup or salad sufficed. A late afternoon swim helped to relax tense muscles and prepare us for dinners that were replete with vegetables complemented by chicken or seafood and hearty bread.</p>

        <p>Last February a friend and I (both 60-ish women who walk about three miles every morning) flew to Tucson for a week of hiking. We went prepared with sunscreen, sun-blocking shirts and hats, several water bottles each and a first-aid kit in our backpacks, plus an ample supply of ibuprofen just in case.</p>
        <p>Each morning before heading for the hills we filled sealable plastic bags with orange and grapefruit sections for rest-stop refreshment. After a substantial breakfast of cereal and fruit and a vigorous morning hike of about four hours, a light lunch of soup or salad sufficed. A late afternoon swim helped to relax tense muscles and prepare us for dinners that were replete with vegetables complemented by chicken or seafood and hearty bread.</p>
        <p>Several things amazed me. First, my ability to get to the end of what seemed like endless uphill trails, and then down again. Second, the lack of aches and pains either during the hikes or after them. Third, the fact that I came home about four pounds lighter, despite having eaten out two meals a day for a week. My parting words to my friend were, ''When are we going to do this again?''</p>
        <p>Hiking is more than a wonderful sport, it's an uplifting experience. The desert scenery, wildlife and vegetation enhanced the exhilaration of accomplishment. We encountered many hikers younger and older (including a few with babies on their backs) trekking up and down the Tucson hills, each at his or her own pace, all having a grand time.</p>
        <p>But you rarely have to go so far from home to reap the joy and health benefits of a hike. Wherever you happen to live, there is probably an ideal place for a day hike within an hour's drive of home. The American Hiking Society maintains a nationwide list of hiking clubs; most have local trail maps and operate organized guided hikes. For more information, visit the society's Web site at www.americanhiking.org or contact the society at 1422 Fenwick Lane, Silver Spring, Md. 20910, (301) 565-6704.</p>
        <p>As with any physical activity, the secret to a pleasurable hike is to know how to accomplish it free of injury and illness. But because accidents and upsets can happen even to the most accomplished hiker, the wise trekker is prepared. Dr. Albert P. Rosen of  New Jersey, who for years has been writing a health column for the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference newsletter, has compiled much useful information in a book, ''Health Hints for Hikers,'' published in 1994 by the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference. The $5.95 volume (plus 80 cents for shipping and handling) is available at 232 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016 or on its Web site, www.nynjtc.org.</p>
        <p>Before you go hiking, check local maps (including changes in elevation) and select a trail appropriate to your age and ability. If you are not used to long walks or hills, start with something relatively flat at an altitude of no more than 5,000 feet and only a few miles long. Save longer, higher climbs for later, when you're in better shape.</p>
        <p>Buy or prepare a first-aid kit that is compact and waterproof. Dr. Rosen says it should contain adhesive tape, sterile gauze pads, alcohol preps, clear tape (Dermiclear or Transpore), bandages, Telfa sterile pads, antihistamines, aspirin or acetaminophen or ibuprofen, safety pins and Moleskin or Molefoam. Optional items include a triangular bandage or large bandanna that could be used as a sling, an Ace bandage, Second Skin, duct tape and tweezers (for removing ticks and splinters).</p>
        <p>Take along -- and use -- plenty of sunscreen and insect repellent (30 percent DEET is adequate for mosquitoes, gnats and ticks). If anyone in the group is allergic to insect stings, a preloaded syringe of adrenaline should always be handy.</p>
        <p>If you expect to become a regular hiker, you'd be wise to take an American Red Cross first-aid course that includes instruction in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>
        <p>Don't underestimate the amount of water you'll need. Dehydration is the curse of endurance activities. It impairs performance and can be very dangerous. It is best to carry in purified water, at least two cups for every hour of activity. If that is not possible, bring some method of water purification (do not drink straight from a stream, no matter how pristine it may look) and know how to use it properly.</p>
        <p>Wear ankle-high hiking boots -- not sneakers -- and break them in before you take them trekking. A seasoned hiker warned me years ago about ankle protection. She always wore boots, except one time, the time she broke her ankle. Be sure your boots are long enough to keep your toes from jamming as you go downhill. Tighten the laces and stand on a downhill slant; if your toes slide into the tip of the boot, you can permanently damage the nail bed, not to mention the crippling pain of an injured toe.</p>
        <p>Check on expected climate conditions -- mountaintops can be frigid, even in mid-summer -- as well as the local weather report. Even in Tucson, I found that in the early morning I needed gloves and ear covers. Avoid cotton clothing if you expect cold temperatures. Wool or polyproylene fabrics are better at retaining insulating properties when wet. Your backpack should be big enough to allow you to shed and stow extra clothing. And don't forget a brimmed hat to protect you from sun and heat. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke (a life-threatening condition) are common in summer and can quickly become medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>Falls and accompanying injuries are possible even for the most careful hiker. A walking stick (Europeans often use an umbrella, not a bad idea if rain is a possibility.) can help hikers of any age remain upright. Don't walk on ice without crampons. Avoid stepping on mossy areas, wet leaves and wet rocks, and step over logs, not on them.</p>
        <p>If you have a heart condition or a breathing disorder, you'd be wise to limit your hikes to relatively low altitudes, say, below 5,000 feet, unless you can allow time to get acclimated to higher altitudes before you start hiking. Be sure to stretch your leg muscles before and especially after your hike to reduce the risk of leg cramps.</p>
        <p>If you have allergies, a nonsedating antihistamine (available only by prescription) is a good preventive. If you use an over-the-counter antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, let someone else drive to your destination.</p>
        <p>Tick protection is a common problem in many areas of the country, and not just to prevent Lyme disease. Ticks also carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borrelia and other illnesses. Many experts advise wearing long sleeves and long pants that are tucked into socks, then spraying the clothing with DEET, which offers protection for days.</p>
        <p>Others who find hiking in long clothes very uncomfortable spray their skin; protection lasts for six to eight hours. Even with DEET, however, it is critical to shower and rub your skin with a cloth soon after your hike, and inspect your skin (better yet, have someone else inspect it) for any sign of ticks, which should be promptly removed with a tweezer.</p>
