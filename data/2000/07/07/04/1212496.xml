        <p>For three generations, Juan Quiroz Romero's family has run a fruit-and-vegetable stand in the market that sits in the shadow of the presidential mansion, Los Pinos. But Mexican politics seemed so impenetrable, he said, that he has never felt close to it.</p>
        <p>But several hours after he had cast his vote on Sunday, Mr. Quiroz said he realized that he had touched power for the first time. His choice for president, Vicente Fox Quesada, would be the first man in 70 years to oust the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, known as the PRI, from the presidency.</p>
        <p>''I never thought that Fox would win, even if all the votes were for him, because the PRI was so powerful,'' Mr. Quiroz said with his voice still full of shock. ''The people finally showed that we are more powerful than any political party, even a dictatorship like the PRI. Now the people are in control.''</p>
        <p>That euphoric feeling of empowerment was echoed across Mexico today among people of various backgrounds, professions and political stripes; in newspaper columns and radio commentary; and in bookstores and cafes. A day after the most historic election in recent Mexican history, this nation seemed stunned and excited by Mr. Fox's decisive triumph over one of the longest ruling political machines in the world.</p>
        <p>The victory, people said, was more than a challenge for the president-elect. In words mostly filled with optimism, people expressed pride in the peaceful way the votes were cast and counted and in the way that they overcame their fear of change and embraced it and in the feeling that their country would be more widely viewed as a sophisticated world player.</p>
        <p>Many of those interviewed, no matter which candidate they had supported, emerged with some personal feeling of triumph.</p>
        <p>''For me, it is as if I had a new child,'' said Sergio Garcia, 50, who owns a photo shop in a barrio close to the Mexico City airport. ''One hopes with great anxiety that he will be a good child.''</p>
        <p>The owner of a stationery store next door said he hoped that the new government would pay more attention to the needs of the people like him, those who live and work in dilapidated crime-ridden neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''We ask for many things,'' the store owner said, ''safety, food, sidewalks, and we don't get them. We shouldn't have to demand these basic things. But we have to. I hope that with this change we can now ask for the potholes to be filled, and that they do it quickly.''</p>
        <p>Along with the hopefulness, however, there was also reticence among people on the street. The manager of a department store worried about the possibilities of a financial crisis. A tortilla maker wondered whether Mr. Fox could live up to promises to fight corruption rather than become enmeshed in it. A university student worried about how his fervent Catholicism -- he opposes abortion -- would infringe on the rights of women.</p>
        <p>One steadfast supporter of the PRI said she did not believe that Mr. Fox even knew how to be presidential. ''I feel like if he were in his own house he would not know where to find the plates, the spoons or the knives,'' said the PRI supporter, Grisel Camacho, 22, an accountant. ''He is the kind of person who, in his own house, he would not know how to do anything because he has no experience.''</p>
        <p>At a popular bookstore, Ghandi, filled with people who supported the left-wing candidate for president, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, there were just worries in general.</p>
        <p>''History certainly has been changed, but I am a little worried about which way things will go,'' said Patricia Garrido Elizalde, 40, a psychoanalyst who was browsing a table of discounted best-sellers. ''Fox is part of the right wing, and I am not sure that will be very good for the country. I just disagree with many of his views.''</p>
        <p>Still, even she made sure to emphasize something about Election Day that left her encouraged about her country. ''I was at a restaurant, and usually it is packed at lunch,'' she said. ''But it was empty. I was thinking there must be a soccer game or something. Then I realized it was because of the election. People everywhere went to vote. I saw signs of it. It was a very positive change.''</p>
        <p>Outside the store, Francisco Rosales, 50, stopped picking through a stack of classical literature to say he had also voted for Mr. Cardenas, who came in third place. But, Mr. Rosales said, he had few feelings of remorse.</p>
        <p>''This is a new day for me,'' said Mr. Rosales, an English teacher. ''For me, the most important thing is that the PRI is finished, and once they are gone, everything else in our lives will be easier. There will be less corruption, less manipulation, less fear and more participation.''</p>
        <p>Back at the market near Los Pinos, people like Luis Manuel Dominguez Orijuela said that they did not expect all of Mexico's troubles to vanish quickly and that they would be happy with slow steady steps toward progress.</p>
        <p>Mexicans took the first step on Election Day, said Mr. Dominguez, 38, a telephone repairman. ''For the first time,'' he added as he ate stewed chicken at a lunch counter, ''we are entering a government that was really created by the people. This is not a cosmetic victory. It is real.''</p>
        <p>Along a commercial strip in the working-class town of Nezahuacoyotl, just east of the capital, the celebration of Mr. Fox's victory stretched into the late afternoon. Students waved at passing cars, holding up their first two fingers, now a well-known gesture from Mr. Fox's campaign.</p>
        <p>''My parents used to say it was better to vote for someone who is bad but familiar rather than someone who is good but unknown,'' said Alejandro Robles, a student of veterinary medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who stood smiling among a group of Fox supporters even though he had voted for Mr. Cardenas. ''I think young people are ready to try something new.''</p>
        <p>The manager of a clothing store showed off the ink that was rubbed on his thumb at the polls to indicate that he had voted. He had voted, he said, for Mr. Fox, but he saw the election as a victory for many.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Fox became president,'' the manager said, ''but the people of Mexico became a democracy.''</p>
