        <p>New studies offer first solid evidence that fish larvae tend to remain in coastal areas and settle back where they were born, in a closed population model, rather than shuttling great distances in an open population model; studies were led by Stephen Swearer of University of California at Santa Barbara and James Cook of University of Townsville, Australia; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The typical saltwater fish's childhood is something of a lost time, at least for scientists trying to study it. Not much is known about what happens during most fishes' larval stages, when they are tiny and floating in the plankton in the swirling waters. And that has led to a great question in marine ecology: are fish populations open, with young fish shuttling in and out across great distances, or closed, with juveniles largely settling back where they were born?</p>
        <p>Now, research offers the first solid evidence that larvae can, and do, go home again, that a population of fish retains many of its offspring. The findings have great implications for managing ocean fish stocks and developing marine reserves.</p>
        <p>''I think the results are incredibly surprising,'' said Stephen Swearer, a researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the lead author of a study of reef fish on St. Croix in the Caribbean. ''The paradigm was that marine populations were open. But it seemed to me more logical that this is what larvae were doing.''</p>
        <p>The St. Croix study and a study of fish on the Great Barrier Reef by scientists at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, shed light on what happens to the larvae during the pelagic phase, when they are out in the plankton amid ocean currents. It is like finding out what happens to a needle in a haystack swept up in a tornado.</p>
        <p>The researchers in both studies made use of a tiny ear bone found in fish larvae to help trace their whereabouts. The bone, called the otolith, is no larger than a grain of sand and adds layers of calcium carbonate as the larvae develop, like a daily version of a tree ring.</p>
        <p>But the two groups' approaches were vastly different. The Australian scientists used brute force, tagging some 10 million damselfish embryos collected around one island by soaking them in a tetracyline solution. Fifteen of 5,000 juvenile fish collected over the ensuing weeks had the tetracycline marker, which shows up as a fluorescent stain under a microscope.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't seem like a lot,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Jones, the Australian team's lead researcher. But since only a tiny fraction of the embryos around the island were tagged -- less than 2 percent by the researchers' estimate -- the numbers mean that 15 to 60 percent of juveniles may be returning to the island. ''It tends to suggest that these larvae have some sort of mechanism for staying in the same area,'' Dr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>The Santa Barbara team, by contrast, ''tried to let nature do the tagging for us,'' Mr. Swearer said.</p>
        <p>Using extremely sensitive mass spectrometry techniques, he analyzed otoliths of bluehead wrasse fish for trace-metal content. Coastal waters tend to be rich in trace metals -- from erosion and pollution, among other things -- while the open ocean tends to be depleted of such elements. So the trace-metal content of an otolith tells a tale something like a flight recorder, showing in what waters the larvae developed.</p>
        <p>The St. Croix results showed that many of the fish spent their time in coastal waters, meaning that the larvae were retained locally and did not cross the open ocean from somewhere else. ''We found that retention is much more prevalent,'' Mr. Swearer said.</p>
        <p>The two studies, published in the journal Nature, ''were essentially the first empirical evidence that fish with pelagic larvae come back to natal areas,'' said Dr. Robert R. Warner, a professor at Santa Barbara who worked on the St. Croix research.</p>
        <p>Dr. Warner has formed a group to study the issue, particularly the question of how a fish larva, often thought of as a passive lump, accomplishes the feat of returning home.</p>
        <p>One scientist studying the behavior of fish larvae is Dr. Robert K. Cowen, a biologist at the University of Miami. In a recent paper in Science, he argued that after they develop swimming ability, some larvae can adjust their depth, avoiding strong offshore currents and drifting in deeper water headed toward shore.</p>
        <p>''Small larvae aren't going to have much effect trying to swim against a strong current,'' Dr. Cowen said. ''But by going 10, 20, maybe 30 meters in the vertical, they can end up in a current going in a different direction. It doesn't take much behavior of the larvae to get in that onshore flow.''</p>
        <p>How do they know which direction is toward shore, toward where they were spawned? Dr. Cowen said that sense of hearing might play a role. ''Reefs are very noisy places, with waves, snapping shrimp and bubbles,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The larvae might also be able to smell the reef through the water. ''They might have the ability to pick up relatively small gradients in these cues to be capable of finding where they want to go from some distance away,'' Dr. Cowen said.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how larvae do it, the evidence that they are retained locally may result in a rethinking of how to manage fish stocks and design preserves, said Dr. James Bohnsack, a research biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in South Florida. In the past, a fish spawning area might have been thought of as helping to populate areas far away. But if a spawning reef is largely repopulating itself, there may be a need for more preserves.</p>
        <p>In fact, Dr. Bohnsack said, the new research is already being used to formulate a fish conservation plan for the Tortugas area west of the Florida Keys.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to take the science and apply it to practical problems,'' Dr. Bohnsack said. ''Now we understand a little bit more about it, so hopefully we can do a little bit more about it.''</p>
