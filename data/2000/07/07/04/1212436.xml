        <p>Napster, the embattled Internet music start-up, today asked a federal judge not to shut down its service, asserting in a court brief that individual Napster users are doing nothing illegal by making personal collections of copyrighted music they download over the Internet.</p>
        <p>In the brief filed in federal court in San Francisco, Napster lawyers also argued the service enhances record sales rather than erodes them, an assertion that the record industry strongly disputes and one that could be central to determining the outcome of the case.</p>
        <p>On July 26, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the Federal District Court here is scheduled to consider whether to grant the recording industry's request for a preliminary injunction that would shut down Napster pending a trial. The trial is being closely watched by policy makers and businesses because it may give some shape to amorphous copyright law on the Internet, a medium in which data can be swapped easily.</p>
        <p>The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major record labels in the suit, asserts that millions of Internet users have downloaded Napster's software and are sharing millions of files of copyrighted music using the MP3 format. Napster users swap files they keep on their home computers.</p>
        <p>The recording industry argues that the practice is costing the recording industry irreparable damage in the form of lost sales. It is suing Napster for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, alleging the company's technology abets in, and profits from, consumers infringing copyrights.</p>
        <p>In its brief, Napster's legal team, led by David Boies, who argued the government's antitrust case against Microsoft, said people who use Napster are permitted to download files under the federal Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. Mr. Boies said the act permits copying of files for personal, noncommercial use.</p>
        <p>''If a consumer can copy an MP3 file from his or her hard drive without violating the copyright laws, it is self-evident that Napster's Internet directory service does not violate the copyright laws either,'' according to the brief.</p>
        <p>In turn, if individual users are not guilty of copyright infringement then the company cannot be guilty of contributory infringement, Mr. Boies said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Generally, the first line of defense in a contributory copyright case is to assert individual users are not guilty of copyright infringement. In this instance, the recording industry does not concede that the Audio Home Recording Act permits such copying. But, moreover, the industry asserts Napster has created a commercial enterprise to capitalize on the copying and to promote it.</p>
        <p>''Whether or not it is lawful for users to share music one on one, it is entirely different for a commercial entity to create a business that induces users to do that,'' said Cary Sherman, the R.I.A.A.'s general counsel, in a statement today. ''Napster cannot hide behind what consumers might be able to do, individually and on their own, to build its own commercial business.''</p>
        <p>The two sides are wielding competing studies to illustrate the impact of Napster on record sales. According to a survey the R.I.A.A. commissioned from Field Research Corporation, a San Francisco-based research firm, 22 percent of Napster users said that because of Napster, they did not buy CD's any more or they buy fewer CD's.</p>
        <p>Not so, according to a Napster-backed study, prepared by Peter S. Fader, Associate Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>''Over 91 percent of Napster users buy as much or more music than before they used Napster, with 28 percent purchasing more,'' the brief asserts, citing Mr. Fader's survey of Napster users.</p>
