        <p>I'm Brassy, a 12-1 long shot racing for only the fourth time, won the $150,000 Prioress at Belmont Park yesterday in a race in which three outsiders got to the finish line first, while the two favorites were striking out.</p>
        <p>I'm Brassy rushed into the lead, stayed there and won by the length of her neck over Dat You Miz Blue, who was 6-1. Lucky Livi was 2 1/2 lengths back in third place at 10-1.</p>

        <p>I'm Brassy, a 12-1 long shot racing for only the fourth time, won the $150,000 Prioress at Belmont Park yesterday in a race in which three outsiders got to the finish line first, while the two favorites were striking out.</p>
        <p>I'm Brassy rushed into the lead, stayed there and won by the length of her neck over Dat You Miz Blue, who was 6-1. Lucky Livi was 2 1/2 lengths back in third place at 10-1.</p>
        <p>Then came the stragglers, both better regarded by the betting public: Dream Supreme, owned by George Steinbrenner, was fourth at 5-2, and Cover Gal, imported from California after finishing first or second in all eight of her starts, was ninth and last at 2-1.</p>
        <p>''She was spinning her wheels,'' said John Velazquez, who rode Cover Gal. ''I thought if she could pass horses on the far turn, she would get confidence, but that didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>What did happen was that I'm Brassy took the lead by the time they had run a quarter of a mile and held it by a narrow margin against Dat You Miz Blue. Closing to third place, Lucky Livi couldn't catch the leaders. And Dream Supreme, after breaking awkwardly, had nothing left in the homestretch.</p>
        <p>The winner raced the six furlongs under Mike Luzzi in a snappy 1:09 2/5, paid $25.40 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000. Her trainer, Kristina Dupps, who bagged her first stakes victory, said: ''I wanted her to go to the front and set the pace. We had to try stakes company while we could run against 3-year-old fillies instead of waiting to go against older fillies.''</p>
        <p>In the 108th running of the Tremont for 2-year-olds, City Zip won for the second time in five starts. The colt, a son of Carson City, was bought for only $9,000 in February by Charles R. Thompson and Carl Bowling, and has run in the money in all five of his races.</p>
        <p>City Zip ran the five and a half furlongs with Jose Santos riding in 1:034/5  after shooting the first quarter-mile in 214/5  seconds. At the finish, he had three lengths on The Goo, trained by Nick Zito, with a D. Wayne Lukas colt, the favored Scorpion, finishing third. The winner paid $15.80 for a $2 bet to win as the fourth choice in a five-horse field.</p>
        <p>Linda Rice, who also trained the winner of the Tremont in 1995, Rosie O'Greta, said City Zip lost his left front shoe during the race.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>JERRY BAILEY, who rode four winners on Sunday and increased his leading total in the jockey standing to 52, missed all of yesterday's races because he was contending with a kidney stone. His agent, RON ANDERSON, said it was unlikely that Bailey would handle Almutawakel today in the $500,000 Suburban Handicap.</p>
