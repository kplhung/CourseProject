        <p>As playgrounds go, it is rather old-fashioned. The rest of North Beach has gone trendy, with neon-signed bistros edging out spaghetti joints and old tenements transformed into condos. But the playground is still the basic city model: two and a third acres of asphalt, with swings and monkey bars, basketball courts and a baseball diamond. Its main attractions are a pool no one would be caught dead in past age 10 and a boccie court where the same men have been playing for decades.</p>
        <p>The playground probably looks a lot as it did 50 years ago, even 75. That would be when Joe DiMaggio the fisherman's son was learning how to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball into a whirling dervish. He played baseball here with three brothers, good players in their own right, and made North Beach Playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great baseball players of all time.</p>

        <p>As playgrounds go, it is rather old-fashioned. The rest of North Beach has gone trendy, with neon-signed bistros edging out spaghetti joints and old tenements transformed into condos. But the playground is still the basic city model: two and a third acres of asphalt, with swings and monkey bars, basketball courts and a baseball diamond. Its main attractions are a pool no one would be caught dead in past age 10 and a boccie court where the same men have been playing for decades.</p>
        <p>The playground probably looks a lot as it did 50 years ago, even 75. That would be when Joe DiMaggio the fisherman's son was learning how to turn a bat into a lightning bolt and a hard ball into a whirling dervish. He played baseball here with three brothers, good players in their own right, and made North Beach Playground famous as the humble beginning of one of the great baseball players of all time.</p>
        <p>So when DiMaggio died last year, it seemed natural to rename the playground in his honor. Then kids who played in Joe DiMaggio Playground would know that this was a special place, where Hall of Fame athletes could be seeded. It also seemed fitting to choose a place DiMaggio would have recognized from the old days. Whenever he slipped into town to escape his legend, it was to the old haunts. He avoided the neon signs and the menus with double nonfat lattes and headed to the wooden bars with grizzled men who knew that Joe DiMaggio the Yankee baseball star who married the biggest movie star of his day (if for a little while) was the same Joe who once wore hand-me-downs and blushed in the presence of girls.</p>
        <p>What DiMaggio would make of the fight over the renaming of the playground is anyone's guess. He would ignore all requests to appear at ceremonies in his honor. He was embarrassed, his old friends say, by the attention. But Morris Engelberg, the Florida lawyer in charge with guarding the Joe DiMaggio name, apparently believes his old friend deserves more. Bigger. An airport, at the very least. Or a freeway. Last week, when a federal judge tossed out Mr. Engelberg's lawsuit blocking the renaming of the playground, Mr. Engelberg vowed to appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engelberg's lawsuit, filed on behalf of DiMaggio's estate, says the city wants to use the DiMaggio name to raise property values in North Beach. This accusation makes San Franciscans laugh. Dot-comers have already raised the property values in North Beach to the stratosphere. Studios rent for $1,800, and one-bedroom condos are in the $700,000 range. A playground, even one with a ballplayer's name on it, could only raise values higher if its courtyard were turned into a parking lot or its pool into a cafe.</p>
        <p>Last week, however, Mr. Engelberg added a new reason for objecting to Joe DiMaggio Playground: the city charges 50 cents to use the park's pool. ''Joe DiMaggio,'' he said, ''would never tolerate and stand for his name being used on a public facility where you charge children to use the pool there.''</p>
        <p>Joe DiMaggio's grandchildren, who live in the Bay Area, are said to be behind the lawsuit, and of the opinion that a playground is too small a tribute. But in San Francisco, the consensus is that the lawsuit is rather petty.</p>
        <p>''It just seems silly,'' said Carole Suskind, who was sitting on a bench here this afternoon watching her 3-year-old son, Todd. ''Doesn't the family, or whoever, realize how conceited it makes them seem?''</p>
        <p>Gavin Newsom, a San Francisco supervisor who sponsored the resolution last year to rename the park, goes further.</p>
        <p>'' 'Consensus' is a great adjective to use in this case, because it is so rare to have consensus in this city,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''But in this case, the consensus is that the playground is an appropriate site for a tribute and that the lawsuit against the city is an absurd waste of time, money and attention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Newsom said the city would be having a big renaming ceremony at the playground as soon as Dom DiMaggio, Joe's surviving sibling, could arrange to come here from his home in Florida. Dom, it turns out, is very happy that the playground will be named after his brother. Joe, Dom DiMaggio said, would love the tribute, too, in his own quiet way.</p>
