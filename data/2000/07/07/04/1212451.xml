        <p>Jan-Michael Gambill was too numb from his victory today to let the reality of playing Pete Sampras in the quarterfinals on Wednesday crash his feel-good moment.</p>
        <p>For years, Gambill has played under the burden to be the next great American player. Early this evening, he levitated above the Wimbledon grass after serving 33 aces and upsetting ninth-seeded Thomas Enqvist, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>

        <p>Jan-Michael Gambill was too numb from his victory today to let the reality of playing Pete Sampras in the quarterfinals on Wednesday crash his feel-good moment.</p>
        <p>For years, Gambill has played under the burden to be the next great American player. Early this evening, he levitated above the Wimbledon grass after serving 33 aces and upsetting ninth-seeded Thomas Enqvist, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''I'd say I'm one of the luckiest people on earth,'' said the 56th-ranked Gambill, 23, who makes his home in Colbert, Wash. ''I get to go out there in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and play on Center Court, play Pete Sampras, the king of Wimbledon, the best player to ever play the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to go out there and have a lot of fun. I'm going to play great tennis. It's something to look forward to.''</p>
        <p>He has arrived at this point after a so-so year. In the spring, Gambill tried a new racket, ditched it to return to his old one and then regained his confidence. Now, his performance at Wimbledon might land him on the Davis Cup team.</p>
        <p>''Davis Cup is something I hold very special,'' Gambill said. ''There are a lot of players who could play. To be named to the team is huge. It would be very exciting.''</p>
        <p>There has always been a lot of buzz around Gambill. Named after the actor Jan-Michael Vincent by his mother, who liked the ring of the name, Gambill was at the center of some hype when his ranking popped up to 31 in March 1999. From there, he slipped down the ranking and out of sight, until this week. Before Wimbledon, he had never advanced past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament.</p>
        <p>Now, he's all the rage. In a tabloid report, he was linked to the pop singer Britney Spears and was asked about another teen idol, Christina Aguilera.</p>
        <p>''I never met either of those girls,'' said Gambill, who recently signed a contract with the Ford Modeling Agency. ''That's really funny. I have a girlfriend. My girlfriend lives in Connecticut. She's a model, not a singer.''</p>
        <p>Philippoussis' New Life</p>
        <p>In the months since Mark Philippoussis toned down his night life, his energy and focus have given him a new life on the court. This evening, he continued his march through the men's draw with a 6-1, 5-7, 6-7 (9), 6-3, 6-3 victory against Britain's last hope, Tim Henman. Philippoussis' victory came just two days after his five-hour third-round match.</p>
        <p>''I just got a couple of massages,'' said Philippoussis, who ripped 43 aces on Saturday and 34 today. ''I stayed relaxed. I just wanted to leave everything on the court again.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Philippoussis will take his big serve and face the best returner in the game, Andre Agassi, during a quarterfinal match. Mentally and physically, he said, he is prepared to go another five sets if necessary.</p>
        <p>''I'm 23, and I feel pretty young,'' Philippoussis said. ''I'm sure I've got a few more in me.''</p>
        <p>A Brief Interruption</p>
        <p>A streaker interrupted play on Court 14 during a doubles match between the teams of Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva and Amy Frazier and Katie Schlukebir. With a slogan off a Kournikova ad for sports bras written across his chest, the streaker was quickly grabbed by security as he darted across the court. In response, Kournikova buried her head into a towel.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't paying attention,'' said Kournikova, whose team advanced to the fourth round, 6-2, 6-1. ''That's why we probably are professional athletes. We kind of are used to everything around. I was just trying to think about the match and about the next game especially because it was important.''</p>
