        <p>Americans bought fewer autos from General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler than expected in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they own.</p>
        <p>Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Industrywide sales rose 0.2 percent, to 1.61 million cars and light trucks, according to the Autodata Corporation, based on reports from 17 of 24 carmakers and estimates for the rest. Monthly records by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and gains from other overseas makers, including Volkswagen, helped surprise analysts who expected United States sales to fall 1.4 percent. First-half sales rose 6.1 percent, to a record 9.12 million.</p>
        <p>Asian and European automakers have ''competitively priced, attractive product'' that is luring buyers, said David Garrity, an auto analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
        <p>Record gasoline prices, rising interest rates and stock market declines may be starting to take the wind out of a yearlong buying spree, analysts said. Even so, the estimated annual selling rate in June of 17 million is in line with record sales of 16.96 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>The United States auto sales boom began in earnest in May 1999, when the annual selling rate hit 17.3 million. Until last year, 15 million was considered a strong performance.</p>
        <p>Toyota, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, reported a 7.8 percent gain, while Honda, the No. 5 maker, said sales rose 16 percent; it was the best June ever for both companies. Volkswagen of Germany said its sales rose 9 percent.</p>
        <p>Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose $1, to $53.0625, today, while G.M. rose $1.5625, to $59.625. Shares of Ford rose 93.75 cents, to $43.9375. Sales were announced after trading closed at 1 p.m. for the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>General Motors sold 459,994 North American-built cars and light trucks, a bigger decline than the 5.2 percent average analyst forecast. Total sales including imports and large trucks fell 5 percent, to 472,078. Total car sales fell 2.3 percent, while total truck sales slid 8.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Car sales in June were hurt by declines at its Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Cadillac divisions.</p>
        <p>Ford sold 401,680 North American-built cars and light trucks in June, down 3.1 percent, compared with the  2.3 percent decline forecast. Total sales including Volvo, Jaguar and heavy trucks fell 2.6 percent, to 419,932. Total car sales declined 5.5 percent while total truck sales slipped 0.3 percent.</p>
        <p>Ford is phasing out production of its Mercury Mystique and Ford Contour cars to build a new compact sport utility that goes on sale later this year. Sales of the Taurus car were unchanged.</p>
        <p>The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler sold 215,597 cars and light trucks in June, missing forecasts that sales would fall 5.9 percent. Car sales fell 20 percent while sales of trucks, minivans and sport utilities declined 5.8 percent. Total sales including Mercedes-Benz fell about 8.6 percent, to 233,516.</p>
        <p>Sales of DaimlerChrysler's minivans, which will not be redesigned until later this quarter, fell 25 percent, even though discounts increased on some of the longer models.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect United States auto sales to cool the remainder of the year because of higher interest rates and declines in the stock market, the source of some car-buyers' wealth.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve's six interest rate increase in the last year ''have definitely hurt, as has the market's reaction to the moves,'' said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.</p>
        <p>The United States average retail price of regular gasoline hit a record $1.681 a gallon in June. Some automakers reported softer vehicle demand in Midwest, where the average price was highest, but said gas prices did not affect sales nationwide.</p>
