        <p>The headquarters of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, with its titanic statues of dead leaders and its monumental political machinery, was going to be the site of a grand election fiesta on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the party's stage set became the scene of a political funeral.</p>
        <p>When the first televised returns came in, showing the party being crushed in the provincial races, four political operatives watching the news physically recoiled from the screen, screwing their eyes shut, as if hit by a blinding flash. One, a young woman in a white polo shirt emblazoned with the party's red, white and green insignia, opened her eyes wide and began to cry.</p>
        <p>Like frolickers at a company picnic struck by a thunderstorm, party supporters called off the festivities. They furled their flags and banners and hugged one another for comfort. Yuppie lawyers wept into their cell phones. Budding politicians stared into space, seeing their futures evaporate in a flash.</p>
        <p>''It's the will of the people,'' Pedro Haces, an attorney and a lifetime adherent of the governing party, known as the PRI, said in a voice filled with sadness, bitterness and resignation. ''We live in a democracy.''</p>
        <p>The vote against the PRI was in part a rejection of their oldest and wisest leaders, known universally in Mexican political circles (except inside party headquarters) as ''the dinosaurs.''</p>
        <p>The dinosaurs and their offspring were holed up in the party's headquarters on Sunday night when the bad news started flooding in. They listened in silence as their candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who was to have proclaimed the latest in an unbroken string of victories reaching back a lifetime, told them that things looked grim.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida and the old guard filed into the auditorium to face the party faithful before the television cameras. As he made a short, bittersweet speech, the dinosaurs who took the stage stood as far away from him as physically possible. The crowd stood and applauded, cheered and wept, shouted and punched the air with their fists.</p>
        <p>Then the faithful dimmed the lights and, by the hundreds, walked out, marching silently past the black-shirted security guards and the bronze statues of the old heroes, through the gates of what had until that moment been the world's longest ruling party, out into the streets of the capital.</p>
        <p>And out in the streets, thousands of people were shouting for joy in the heart of a transformed nation.</p>
