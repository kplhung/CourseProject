        <p>With their competing array of policy speeches, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush seem to be turning this election into a referendum on which candidate can best reshape government to meet the challenges of the New Economy.</p>
        <p>From health care to education to tax cuts to Social Security, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are placing before the voters significant questions about how some of the most fundamental public institutions should be shaped for a global, digital age that offers the prospect of sustained prosperity -- and enormous uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers say the technology-based economy and the growth of a middle-income investor class will make voters far more responsive to Republican ideas for decentralizing government and reshaping the New Deal and Great Society programs for the elderly. Governor  Bush would like the private sector to provide more government services and make people less dependent on one-size-fits-all federal programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, on the other hand, wants to expand the traditionally Democratic entitlement programs. His aides argue that the lower and middle classes need more government assistance with education and health care and retirement pensions at a time when knowledge is ever more important to success and when employers offer less generous and less secure health and pension plans.</p>
        <p>Those differences were on display again today as Mr. Gore promoted his plan for a Medicare prescription-drug benefit and attacked a House Republican version, supported in concept by Mr. Bush, that subsidizes private insurers to offer the coverage. [Page A10.]</p>
        <p>''It's a misnomer,'' Mr. Gore said here in Clayton of the Republicans' plan. ''It's nothing. It doesn't work.''</p>
        <p>The face-off may not have the same high drama of the cold-war era. Nor have the two candidates focused in a sustained way on hot-button social issues the way the presidential rivals did in 1988 when crime, welfare and flag-burning were the agenda. But analysts in both parties say the stakes are high.</p>
        <p>''The party that seizes the wave of change sweeping our economy is the one that is destined to lead for the coming generation,'' Peter Ross Range, the editor of The New Democrat Blueprint, a magazine of the centrist Democrats, wrote in its latest edition.</p>
        <p>Stephen Goldsmith, Mr. Bush's chief domestic policy adviser said, ''There's a big fault line here.''</p>
        <p>Some talk of the new economy is as much about symbolism as about substance. It allows Mr. Gore to try to capitalize on what should be his greatest strength, the extraordinary economic expansion of the Clinton years. And for Mr. Bush, analysts say, presenting himself as a managerial reformer lets him look less ideological than other Republicans, particularly those in Congress.</p>
        <p>But it is also true that since the last presidential election, the economy has changed sharply. Robust growth has turned deficits into surpluses. Internet use and electronic commerce are exploding. And the stock market, while cooling somewhat in recent months, has generated huge new pools of wealth.</p>
        <p>At the same time, new issues have arisen about the divide between the winners and losers in the New Economy, one that has produced less stable jobs and less stable benefit plans and left millions of Americans without health insurance.</p>
        <p>''The challenge of the New Economy, one of the biggest challenges, is to expand the winners' circle so you don't leave people behind,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist Democrat organization. ''Because one of the dangers of the New Economy is if you leave too many people behind and you have a backlash.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush agree on some broad themes. They both embrace free trade in the increasingly global economy, in contrast to the third-party contenders, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, and many Congressional Democrats.</p>
        <p>They also each call for the federal government to take a stronger role in education policy at a time when the knowledge-based economy rewards the higher educated. And they each speak frequently of helping those whom prosperity has left behind.</p>
        <p>Still, the two have fundamental differences about how to shape government.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Gore would expand three government entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He would bring more of the uninsured under the auspices of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. He would create a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit for the elderly. And he would offer more Social Security benefits to women.</p>
        <p>In addition to Social Security, he would also create a new retirement benefit for the working poor and the middle class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush argues for more individual choice. So he would allow workers to divert an unspecified part of their Social Security payroll tax to private investment accounts. He would turn Medicare from a fee-for-service guaranteed benefit program to one that lets people buy different levels of health insurance.</p>
        <p>And while he too would create a prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, he wants to create subsidies for private insurers so that they, not the government directly, would offer the benefit. He would give tax credits for health insurance but send people to the private market to buy it.</p>
        <p>A similar contrast concerns education. Both men would invest in schools and teachers -- Mr. Gore putting in about 10 times more money than Mr. Bush -- and both have plans for how to improve accountability and performance. But two proposals are particularly telling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would extend the reach of public-school systems by giving states grants to create public pre-schools. Mr. Bush, as a lever against failing schools, would give low-income parents whose children attend such schools vouchers that could pay for private-school tuition.</p>
        <p>And while both candidates favor tax cuts, they differ in method and degree.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush calls for a $1.3-trillion across-the-board tax cut over a decade, saying, ''A government with unlimited funds soon becomes a government of unlimited reach.'' Mr. Gore offers $500 billion in tax cuts intended to reimburse people for particular needs -- like child care or college tuition -- and phasing out as income rises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides call the top-down, big-government structures outmoded relics of the Great Depression. ''Governor Bush will put more control over decisions -- whether they are health, retirement or savings -- in the hands of individuals,'' Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said. ''The vice president will maintain them in the hands of government.''</p>
        <p>Democrats respond that Mr. Bush's ideas would erode the common commitment to many government institutions.</p>
        <p>''The big danger with a lot of the Bush programs is what we call cherry-picking,'' said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. ''The healthy, the wealthy or the well-educated will be the first to opt out, leaving the poor, the sicker and the lesser-educated behind in the general insurance pools or in the education system. This is a sure-fire recipe for social stratification.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides are also trying to turn the debate to the issue of whom the competing plans help, particularly pointing to the tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''Bush takes the old-fashioned approach of cutting everybody's rates which ends up really, really, really helping wealthy people because they pay so much and being of marginal help, if any, to people in lower brackets,'' said Elaine Kamarck, Mr. Gore's policy director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush promotes his tax cut by saying it would remove six million low-income families from the tax rolls. Critics say it would also give most of its benefits to higher-income groups simply because those pay the most taxes.</p>
        <p>An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal public policy group, found that Mr. Bush's plan would give the top 1 percent of tax payers 42 percent of the tax cuts, while the bottom 20 percent of tax payers would get less than 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides counter that their approach to tax cuts gives individuals more choice on how to use their money. ''Gore views government's roles as manipulating people and uses people's own tax money to manipulate their behavior,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. ''Bush says it's your money. You keep it. Do what you think is best with it.''</p>
        <p>A similar debate is brewing over Social Security. Depending on how it is structured, Mr. Bush's plan to switch some Social Security payroll tax to individual savings accounts could prove more lucrative for upper-income groups.</p>
        <p>If two percentage points of payroll tax were diverted to individual investment accounts, someone earning $76,000 annually would have slightly more than $1,500 a year to invest in private markets. Someone earning $25,000 would have $500 to invest. Critics of the idea say it is not hard to see which taxpayer is likely to build up the better retirement account.</p>
        <p>Some plans on Capitol Hill try to address this by cutting the basic Social Security benefit more for higher-income individuals than lower-income ones or by giving extra contributions to low-income workers. Mr. Bush has said the idea of matching funds for the lower incomes should be considered. But he has not committed to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would preserve the current Social Security system, and create a new retirement plan in addition to it. This plan would be similar to a 401 (k) plan and geared toward helping lower-income groups.</p>
        <p>For example, the government would give couples earning less than $30,000 a year $3 for every dollar they put in this savings account; the government match would then reduce as income grew. The program would not be available to couples earning more than $100,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides also say Mr. Gore would make Medicare and Social Security more expansive and costly at a time when the boomer generation's impending retirement threatens to bankrupt the systems.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental challenge facing the next president is to solve this problem,'' Mr. Lindsey said. ''What Gore just proposed is layering another new unfunded entitlement on top of what's already out there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides also prefer to steer the debate to how people are helped. They say they want to give people with lower incomes the same kinds of choices the wealthy have -- whether it is the choice of attending a private school or the choice of investing their retirement money in the stock market.</p>
