        <p>An article in Business Day yesterday about criticism within NBC of the performance of Scott Sassa, president of the NBC television network's West Coast division, imprecisely summarized a portion of an article in The New York Post about him last Friday. The Post article cited an unidentified person as saying that Mr. Sassa might leave his job within days, and it quoted an NBC spokeswoman as denying reports that Mr. Sassa had been asked to resign. The Post article did not say conclusively that Mr. Sassa would be out of his job within days.</p>
