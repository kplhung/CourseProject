        <p>Sales in June for Big Three Were Less Than Expected  Americans bought fewer autos than expected from General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they already own.</p>
        <p>Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent. Industrywide sales rose 0.2 percent, to 1.61 million cars and light trucks. Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose $1, to $53.0625, while G.M. rose $1.5625, to $59.625. Shares of Ford rose 93.75 cents, to $43.9375. [Page C2.]</p>

        <p>Sales in June for Big Three Were Less Than Expected  Americans bought fewer autos than expected from General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they already own.</p>

        <p>Start-Ups Struggle in Silicon Alley  These are trying days for Silicon Alley, an industry made up of as many as 7,000 enterprises, most of them tiny start-ups. They tend to specialize in content rather than technology, making them more vulnerable to gyrations on Wall Street. Several high-profile Internet companies in New York have gone under or are barely hanging on, and more are expected to succumb in the coming months. [B1.]</p>
        <p>Napster Seeks to Forestall Closing  Napster, the Internet music start-up, asked a federal judge not to shut down its service, asserting in a court brief that individual Napster users are doing nothing illegal by making personal collections of copyrighted music they download over the Internet. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Growth in Manufacturing Slows  Manufacturing expanded in June at the slowest pace in 17 months, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management, which said its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June from 53.2 in May. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 0.1 percent in May after falling 1.1 percent in April. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Rise in Sluggish Trading  Stocks rose broadly in light trading before the holiday as investors reacted to a lower-than-expected reading for manufacturing activity in June. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,560.67. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 25.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,991.93, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.72 points, or 1 percent, to 1,469.32. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Treasury prices rose as the yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.98 percent from 6.01 percent and the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.87 percent from 5.89 percent. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Microsoft Bolsters Defense Team  Microsoft added more firepower to the defense team in its antitrust case by hiring Carter G. Phillips, a leading appellate lawyer. [C5.]</p>
        <p>An Inflation Warning for Russia  Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, warned that inflation is rising at an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend economists say could severely strain the incomes of Russians. Mr. Putin, who is making his first attempts at economic policy, was quoted as suggesting at a Kremlin meeting that the government should take steps to slow the pace of inflation. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Shareholders Back Telephone Deal  Minority shareholders of Cable and Wireless voted overwhelmingly to be acquired by Pacific Century Cyberworks, an Internet company run by Richard Li. The deal needs to be ratified by a judge on July 25, but analysts say the vote guarantees that Mr. Li, 33, who runs Pacific Century, will soon own Hong Kong's flagship telephone company. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Wireless Venture May Sell Stake  A British wireless venture backed by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchinson Whampoa and Telesystem International Wireless of Canada, is in talks to sell about a third of the company to NTT DoCoMo and Royal KPN for as much as $2 billion. [C15.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Financial Markets Closed  The stock market and other financial markets in the United States will be closed today in observance of the Fourth of July. Most overseas markets, however, will be open. United States markets will reopen tomorrow.</p>
