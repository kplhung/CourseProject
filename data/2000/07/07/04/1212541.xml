        <p>The Devils added a little more muscle yesterday to an already physical team by signing Jim McKenzie, a free-agent left wing, who is 6 feet 4 inches, weighs 230 pounds and has firmly established a reputation for fighting.</p>
        <p>McKenzie, who played 61 games last season with Anaheim and Washington, has surpassed 200 minutes in penalties three times in his 10-year N.H.L. career. Originally drafted by Hartford in 1989, McKenzie has played 623 games, with 38 goals and 1,321 minutes in penalties. He has also played for Dallas, Pittsburgh, Winnipeg and Phoenix.</p>
