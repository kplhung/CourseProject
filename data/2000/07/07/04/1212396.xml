        <p>WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN  By Simona Vinci  155 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.</p>
        <p>This slender novel by the Italian writer Simona Vinci plunges with such stylistic quiet into forbidden territory that one almost fails to hear the barriers collapsing. Ms. Vinci's forbidden territory in ''What We Don't Know About Children'' is sex among children. The novel tells a shocking story, mostly through the muddled perceptions of a girl named Martina whose desire to be included leads her to become a member of a clandestine club led by a disturbed 15-year-old. But ultimately Ms. Vinci's theme is the normative cruelty that lies within the human soul and the fragility of individual defenses against it.</p>
        <p>Though it is a shocking story, it is, as the author notes in a brief afterward, a plausible one. Still, a question arises about the purpose and the effect of Ms. Vinci's depictions of sexually explicit acts among children. I found myself torn between two contrary reactions.</p>

        <p>WHAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHILDREN  By Simona Vinci  155 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.</p>
        <p>This slender novel by the Italian writer Simona Vinci plunges with such stylistic quiet into forbidden territory that one almost fails to hear the barriers collapsing. Ms. Vinci's forbidden territory in ''What We Don't Know About Children'' is sex among children. The novel tells a shocking story, mostly through the muddled perceptions of a girl named Martina whose desire to be included leads her to become a member of a clandestine club led by a disturbed 15-year-old. But ultimately Ms. Vinci's theme is the normative cruelty that lies within the human soul and the fragility of individual defenses against it.</p>
        <p>Though it is a shocking story, it is, as the author notes in a brief afterward, a plausible one. Still, a question arises about the purpose and the effect of Ms. Vinci's depictions of sexually explicit acts among children. I found myself torn between two contrary reactions.</p>
        <p>One can admire Ms. Vinci for drawing aside the curtain that normally veils this subject and to treat it bravely, unapologetically and with psychological subtlety. But I also wondered whether she transcends the sexual and psychological disturbance that she describes, or, via her book, participates erotically in it. In the end, perhaps, the discomfort one feels in reading this novel points to  its underlying message: that moral behavior, civilization, is based not on the denial of forbidden impulses but on restraint, on governing those impulses when they disrupt the falsely smooth surface of repression.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vinci, described on the dust jacket as a 30-year-old writer who lives near Bologna, provides an arid setting for her tale, a bland, featureless apartment building on the edge of a town called Granarolo, a spot so remote that the courtyard faces a field of corn. Martina stands alone in the middle of the courtyard singing, remembering when the other children, absent now, used to play there.  Ms. Vinci introduces us to two other characters, Luca, who spends his days sleeping in a dark room, and Matteo, who runs, ''methodical and steady,'' although until recently he was inactive, ''like a dead pine cone.''</p>
        <p>Something, in other words, has happened inside the spare and standardized environment of the apartment building and the courtyard, whose cement parking lot, green benches, lampposts, tubular fencing and iron gates suggest a false and empty normality. What is missing is an adult presence. Parents play walk-on roles in the story, but in essence are as distant from the children's emotional lives as the crows circling the cornfields. If Ms. Vinci's story has any practical message to offer, it would be similar to that of the antidrug poster displayed at New York City bus stops, on which a teenage girl wears a tattoo saying, ''Stay involved in my life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vinci's children live in their own culture, careering around on in-line skates, talking about intergalactic travel and playing a game called nuclear war in which ''they simulated nuclear blasts with firecrackers that left a cloud of smoke and made the whole yard stink.'' A subtle, implicit eroticism hangs over the playground like a mist. While there are no parents in evidence, a vague sort of adult evil hovers in the form of two men who pick up Mirko, the 15-year-old leader, in their car from time to time and give him things in plastic bags.</p>
        <p>That was before. Now, the children have gone elsewhere and Martina sings by herself, Luca sleeps and Matteo runs. Five months earlier, Mirko began showing the contents of the plastic bags to Martina, a 14-year-old boy named Luca and Matteo and Greta, both 10. As if these magazines depict models to emulate, the five of them engage in a secret rite led by Mirko, who has a troubled ''Lord of the Flies'' aura of command about him. They go to a shed to engage in the sexual experimentation that is at the prurient heart of Ms. Vinci's story.</p>
        <p>''On the way home Martina sat on Mirko's scooter,'' the narrator writes after the first visit to the shed, ''hanging on to him, with the unpleasant feeling that somehow she had lost something, and that she couldn't do anything about it. All that countryside around them, and something forgotten or lost.''</p>
        <p>Each of the children has a story. But Martina, tormented, powerless and compliant, remains the central figure, the embodiment of the confusion and longing involved in protean sexuality. The blending of disassociated images is psychologically brilliant, from Martina's memory of early auto-erotic desires to a vision of Greta's hands on her desk, ''her filed nails with their chipped, dark-red nail polish,'' that somehow disgusts her.</p>
        <p>''There are horses running through the snow, the stars above,'' Ms. Vinci writes of Martina's fantasy life. ''There's a leap into emptiness, like rounding a hill at full speed in a car.''</p>
        <p>As the children, in thrall to Mirko, extend their explorations, matters hurtle toward tragedy. The two men who call Mirko into their car exercise a strange power; they are an invisible force that leads the children to carry out their prescribed roles not so much because they derive pleasure from them but because they don't know how to escape. But the world the children have created is too complex, too mysterious, for Ms. Vinci's novel to be seen as a parable about the corruption of childhood innocence by adult malice. Innocence does not exist in her world of pubescent and adolescent desire and cruelty, although the corrupting influence of evil grown-ups who step in when parents are absent is clearly a theme of the book.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vinci's book, translated from the Italian by Minna Proctor, is like nothing else you have read. In its way it is more disturbing than ''Lord of the Flies'' because the action takes place not on some abandoned island but in the midst of ordinary life, surrounded by civilization.</p>
