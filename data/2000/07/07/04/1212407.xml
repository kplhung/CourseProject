        <p>Beset with injuries and illness, American Ballet Theater performed valiantly and superbly throughout the season.

        <p>This new ballet by Twyla Tharp, previously called ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' was replaced by George Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' while Marcelo Gomes replaced Mr. Corella in Harald Lander's ''Etudes.''

        <p>Beset with injuries and illness, American Ballet Theater performed valiantly and superbly throughout the season. The closing night on Saturday at the Metropolitan Opera House ended on the same note. Angel Corella suffered a back injury and could not perform in ''The Brahms-Haydn Variations,'' scheduled for its first performance since May 10.</p>
        <p>This new ballet by Twyla Tharp, previously called ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' was replaced by George Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations,'' while Marcelo Gomes replaced Mr. Corella in Harald Lander's ''Etudes.'' The bedroom duet from Kenneth MacMillan's ''Manon'' featured Vladimir Malakhov with Julie Kent, who replaced Susan Jaffe.</p>
        <p>The ''Corsaire'' pas de deux, however, turned up with its announced cast intact: Nina Ananiashvili and Jose Manuel Carreno. Ms. Ananiashvili, a regular member of Ballet Theater in its New York seasons, had been touring the United States with the Bolshoi Ballet, her home company, and returned for the single performance. She is rarely paired with Mr. Carreno, and they both knew how to bring out the dazzle of a familiar showpiece.</p>
        <p>Like Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, who made this pas de deux their signature, Ms. Ananiashvili and Mr. Carreno worked in harmony but banked on contrast. But unlike the first partnership, theirs reversed dynamics. It is Ms. Ananiashvili who has the flourish and Mr. Carreno, with no loss of brilliant bravura in his many turns and high leaps, who has a quiet center. Silken but exciting, he was every inch the slave, as his role demanded, ready to throw himself at the ballerina's feet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili, in top form, conveyed the musical climaxes in all her phrasing, springing into her partner's lifts and giving her polished pirouettes a fillip as she slid her raised foot down to the other ankle. Her fouettes in the coda had variety, and there was a wonderful moment in the adagio when both partners threw their heads back. Dancing the  solo from the full ''Corsaire'' (not the Fonteyn version), Ms. Ananiashvili exuded the boldness that colored the entire performance.</p>
        <p>The ''Manon'' excerpt held its own immediately after because Mr. Malakhov, with his eloquent line, and Ms. Kent, rushing into every embrace with perfect form as a delicious tease, gave the choreography full expression. The performance was profound: the image was of still-innocent lovers, swept into persuasive passion within seven minutes.</p>
        <p>''Theme and Variations'' was choreographed for tall bodies, and Joaquin De Luz at this performance, seemed too short. When Ashley Tuttle extended her leg under his arm she had to flex her foot and bend the leg. Balanchine deserves better.</p>
        <p>''Etudes,'' well led by Mr. Gomez, Maxim Belotserkovsky and Gillian Murphy, was the right closing ballet. The hard-working corps was applauded by Mr. Gomes onstage at the end. The generosity of gesture continued when Ms. Murphy gave a rose from her bouquet to the conductor, David Lamarche. He, in turn, threw the flower to the orchestra, which had been conducted earlier by Ermanno Florio.</p>
