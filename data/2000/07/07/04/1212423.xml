        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter H. Cressy, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (letter, June 28), dismisses alcoholism as a moral failing. Ironically, his industry profits most from sales to heavy and addicted drinkers.</p>
        <p>Numerous studies show that up to 90 percent of all alcohol is consumed by just one-quarter of the drinkers. ''Responsible'' or moderate drinking accounts for no more than 25 percent of the alcohol market.</p>
        <p>Most alcohol is consumed in hazardous quantities, resulting in widespread harm to individuals, families and society. Industry public relations efforts, like ''responsible drinking'' appeals, have done little, if anything, to reduce such problems.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the American Medical Association has long classified alcoholism as a disease, and not a moral inadequacy.</p>
        <p>GEORGE A. HACKER  Washington, June 29, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is director, Alcohol Policies Project, Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>
