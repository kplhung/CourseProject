        <p>The colorful mayor of the chronically depressed upstate city of Utica, Edward A. Hanna, resigned last night.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Hanna, 78, has been fending off allegations of sexual harassment by four male city employees, he said in a statement that the move was ''strictly a health decision,'' prompted by ''my serious heart condition along with my age, the execution of and stress in the regular routine as mayor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna, whose efforts to re  build Utica were often overshadowed by the publicity he got for actions like calling the city ''a lousy place to live,'' bolstered the contention that his decision to resign was health-related by including a list of his daily medications in his news release.</p>
        <p>He also stated that he had been having increasingly frequent chest pains in recent months.</p>
        <p>The mayor also attached a 1992 note from his cardiologist stating that he had blocked arteries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna, a Democrat-turned-Republican who made a fortune off a photo developer he perfected, governed Utica, an old factory town of 64,000 along the Mohawk River 240 miles north of New York City, from 1975 to 1977 and again from January 1996 until 11:59 last night. He also served as city comptroller in the early 90's.</p>
        <p>Under Utica's charter, the Council president, Tim Julian, now becomes mayor and a special election for mayor will be held in November, The Utica Observer-Dispatch reported.</p>
        <p>The sexual harassment accusations against Mr. Hanna, who has been married for more than 50 years, came June 14 in notices of intent to sue him and the city, according to the  Observer-Dispatch.</p>
        <p>The men contend that the mayor threatened their jobs if they refused his sexual advances, the paper said.</p>
        <p>The charges were filed by Mr. Hanna's former executive assistant, 23; a 24-year-old Parks Department employee; a 22-year-old former development administrator; and a 35-year-old former executive assistant with the city, the paper reported.</p>
        <p>In a fax to the Observer-Dispatch, Mr. Hanna called the accusations ''a scam, loaded with outrageous lies.'' The men's lawyer, Joseph Policelli, countered by telling the Observer-Dispatch, ''People don't blackmail people by claiming that they had homosexual activities with somebody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna's statements and actions included the brash and the mysterious. On one hand, he proposed closing down the city government. On the other, he built a Tower of Hope next to City Hall to honor Bob Hope, who has no particular connection to Utica.</p>
        <p>But he nurtured a reputation as a watchdog against fiscal incompetence and corruption, and his many supporters credited him with forcing Utica to confront its difficult situation. When the city's bonds received the poorest rating of any city in the country in 1996, the mayor opined, ''We got just what we deserved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna's resignation statement ended with an epitaph-like sentiment: ''I would hope to be remembered as a mayor who had eyes that could see what needed to be done and a heart that cared.''</p>
