        <p>Greg Easley, the chief executive of a Silicon Alley company called Bottle Rocket, had high expectations for his four-year-old venture, and with good reason. Unlike other high-tech start-ups, his had actual revenues and a client roster that included big names like Major League Baseball and the National Football League.</p>
        <p>But that was before the recent volatility of the Nasdaq market, where many technology and Internet stocks are traded. Now, like many New York new media companies, Bottle Rocket, which makes custom interactive games for sports and media Internet sites, is being forced to scale back its ambitions just at the moment when it thought it would soar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley had hoped to double his workforce, to 70 from 35. Instead, he is riding his young employees harder and praying that they will not be lured away. (He has already lost four of them.) And instead of getting the $8 million infusion of cash that he was counting on, he finds himself struggling to raise a small fraction of that sum.</p>
        <p>''What I've learned,'' said Mr. Easley, 30, during a recent interview at Bottle Rocket's modest Flatiron District offices, ''is that you need to raise money when you don't have to. When you get to the point where you need it, it's much harder.''</p>
        <p>These are trying days for Silicon Alley,  made up of as many as 7,000 enterprises, most of them tiny start-ups. Unlike California's Silicon Valley, New York's new media industry tends to specialize in content rather than technology, making it more vulnerable to gyrations on Wall Street because few of these companies are likely to show a profit any time soon.</p>
        <p>Several high-profile Internet companies in New York, like Brandwise.com, have gone under, or, like APBnews.com, are barely hanging on, and more are expected to succumb in the coming months. This spring, several dozen companies canceled plans to go public. Venture capital companies are becoming more selective and keeping a closer eye on their investments. And landlords are increasingly reluctant to rent to risky Internet companies, with some demanding huge security deposits.</p>
        <p>''The party's over -- to an extent,'' said Andrew J. Brust, 34, who is trying to raise capital to start an Internet company that would focus on business travel.</p>
        <p>That also happens to be true in a literal sense, as Silicon Alley's raucous party scene has quieted down. ''I used to get a dozen invitations in the mail a day,'' said Andrew Rasiej, the chief executive of Digital Club Network, a live music Internet site. ''Now it's more like one or two a day or a couple a week. No one has the money to spend on marketing.''</p>
        <p>Even successful Internet veterans are having a tough time. Kimbal J. Musk, 27, is a founder of Zip2, a company that builds city guides on the Internet (including  NYToday.com, part of New York Times Digital) that was acquired by Compaq earlier this year for $307 million. Mr. Musk's new venture is not faring as well. About 18 months ago, he said, he was able to raise $2 million from early-stage investors for FunkyTalk, a fledgling entertainment Web site, but the money has since dried up.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing is very cutting edge,'' Mr. Musk said. ''The market may not be ready for it. It's a very different world.''</p>
        <p>Other entrepreneurs say capital is still available, but with a trade-off. ''You have to be prepared to give away a much larger percentage of equity in your company,'' Mr. Brust said.</p>
        <p>James L. Marciano, 33, the founder of TheSquare.com, an online network for graduates of prestigious universities, said he got in just under the wire, closing on $6 million in venture capital on April 12, two days before Black Friday, when the Nasdaq index plunged nearly 10 percent. ''It was one of those things where you rub your hand across your brow and say, 'Whew, that was close,' '' Mr. Marciano said. Since then, he said, he has been getting close scrutiny from his investors, probably more than he would have had before. ''They're really anxious to help,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Despite its recent setbacks, Bottle Rocket is not on the casualty list. It gets revenues from its licensing agreements with nearly three dozen clients. And it had no immediate plans to go public. Instead, like many other Silicon Alley businesses, it was counting on partnerships with larger media companies to propel it forward. What happened, however, was that some of the bigger players got hammered by the stock market and could no longer invest in these smaller enterprises.</p>
        <p>''A lot of strategic investors coming into these rounds have pulled out because their stock has plummeted,'' said Kathryn S. Wylde, the chief executive of the New York City Investment Fund, a private company whose goal is to stimulate job growth.</p>
        <p>In Bottle Rocket's case, it was Eidos, Britain's largest game publisher, that backed out of the deal after agreeing in principle to invest $6 million in the New York company. Eidos's withdrawal also cost Bottle Rocket a $2 million investment from Ms. Wylde's fund, which is barred from serving as the lead investor.</p>
        <p>By Internet standards, Bottle Rocket can almost be regarded as venerable. It was founded in 1996 by Mr. Easley, a Richmond, Va., native who had worked at Voyager, a pioneering multimedia developer in SoHo, and a partner, Kelly Moulton. After bringing in a design team from Downtown Digital, a division of AT&amp;T, they were able to raise $500,000 in start-up money from family members and friends.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Bottle Rocket struck a deal with Electronic Arts, a Redwood City, Calif., gamemaker, to license what Mr. Easley describes as its ''flagship'' product, FanSlam, an online trivia contest that pits sports fans against one another. But Electronic Arts, which made a deal last year with America Online to become its exclusive provider of games, needed more time than anticipated to get the game up and running, so Bottle Rocket's upgraded FanSlam was unavailable on AOL during the baseball season. ''A partnership with a huge company works much more slowly than we're used to,'' said Mr. Easley, who had hoped the co-venture would thrust his company into the limelight.</p>
        <p>The deal with Eidos was supposed to give Bottle Rocket a lucrative foothold in Europe and allow the company to develop interactive games for its own Web site. But video game sales have declined precipitously because consumers are waiting until October, when Sony will release its PlayStation 2, a more advanced console than what is on the market now. In March, Eidos's stock fell by 50 percent. The two companies have had no contact in at least two months, Mr. Easley said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Easley, the last few weeks have been sobering -- a lesson that it is not just the ''snake oil salesmen,'' as he describes them, who are getting pounded by market forces. Avoiding the hype and grandiosity that pervades the industry, Bottle Rocket did not hire an outside public relations firm, throw lavish launch parties or promise its employees that it would go public. ''We did not participate in the excess and decadence of this industry,'' said Mr. Easley, who is also a former media reporter for Spy magazine.</p>
        <p>Though Bottle Rocket and many other companies are having a hard time right now, other people in Silicon Alley maintain that the shakeout is a welcome reality check. ''Some people feel relieved,'' Mr. Rasiej said. ''There were a lot of bad business plans out there.''</p>
        <p>Nell Cote, the chief executive of Hudson Williams, a company in Lower Manhattan that makes Web sites run faster, said she had observed a new-found respect among new media entrepreneurs for people with solid business experience.</p>
        <p>''I'm not dyeing my hair right now,'' said Ms. Cote, who is 39.</p>
