        <p>Sure, the fireworks tonight will be spectacular. They're spectacular every year, and this time they're supposed to be bigger than ever.</p>
        <p>But four centuries ago, when people really had imagination, they staged fireworks displays on the Arno River in Florence in which mock battles between dyers and silk weavers vying for the queen's favor ended with the weavers' getting tossed in the river and the god Vulcan erupting in the form of a huge fireball.</p>
        <p>Good clean mayhem and educational, too! That and other historical nuggets can be learned from ''Fireworks!,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through Sept. 17. I suggest you spare yourself the happy crowds, the bombs bursting in air, the balmy breezes of a long summer evening. Stay home watching reruns tonight after spending a few hours this afternoon in the Met perusing old prints and drawings of long-forgotten pyrotechnical displays.</p>
        <p>Please don't thank me. It's my job to tell you these things.</p>
        <p>Some history should enhance your inevitable pleasure. As nearly every child who has ever dreamed of lighting a bottle rocket in the backyard knows, the Chinese, probably by the ninth century, hit on the crazy idea of mixing sulfur, charcoal and potassium nitrate to create gunpowder. It took hundreds of years more, maybe until the 14th century, for backward Europeans to catch up, whereupon they celebrated as often as they could by destroying things.</p>
        <p>A print illustrates what happened in Munich in 1530 after the coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. The Bavarian dukes invited Charles to a big field outside the city where a group of mock Turkish-looking buildings had been built. A battalion of cannons fired at the buildings, and ka-boom! So much for the Turks.</p>
        <p>What fun. Pretty soon, whenever any king or prince was born, married, conquered somebody, issued a decree, took religious vows, recovered from the flu or passed through town, civic leaders lighted dangerous explosives in crowded places. When the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, the younger brother of Philip IV of Spain, visited Antwerp in 1635, Peter Paul Rubens, no less, was enlisted to organize the two-day celebratory spectacle, which ended with fireworks at the cathedral. A print of the occasion (not by Rubens) shows the cathedral spire in silhouette against a burst of streamers.</p>
        <p>It is very scenic. Many of the prints and drawings of fireworks are naturally scenic, artists taking on a subject like this to demonstrate their own pyrotechnical skill. There is, for example, a Russian book of color lithographs and wood engravings commemorating the coronation of Alexander II in 1856 that is three feet tall.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Piranesi's colored etching of the Girandola, the annual fireworks extravaganza atop the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, is a striking example of lighting effects and depicted aerial acrobatics, capturing the experience Dickens described after he saw the Girandola half a century later.</p>
        <p>''The show began with a tremendous discharge of cannon; and then, for 20 minutes or half an hour, the whole castle was one incessant sheet of fire and labyrinth of blazing wheels of every color, size and speed,'' he wrote in 1845. ''In half an hour afterwards, the immense concourse had dispersed; the moon was looking calmly down upon her wrinkled image in the river, and half a dozen men and boys, with bits of lighted candle in their hands, moving here and there, in search of anything worth having that might have been dropped in the press, had the whole scene to themselves.''</p>
        <p>By Dickens's era, fireworks had become so commonplace that artists interested in social interaction, like Daumier and Winslow Homer, began to focus on faces in the crowds rather than on the explosions. Then photographs started to outpace prints as popular documents of notable firework displays. Times were changing.</p>
        <p>But that wasn't quite the end of the story. Anyone who goes to the Guggenheim's ''1900'' show, which is based on the art that was in the Paris Exposition Universelle, will especially want to see the prints and a so-called Chinese toy theater in the Met show that lovingly simulate the fireworks over the Seine when the exposition opened.</p>
        <p>And no red-blooded New Yorker should miss the bird's-eye view of the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883. People crowd the bridge and river. Ships choke the harbor. Rockets blast from the bridge and from the docks. The celebration reportedly lasted more than an hour. In the lithograph, orange and yellow streaks across the gray sky make half the image look almost abstract.</p>
        <p>What more could you want to celebrate the holiday? So forget going to see the real fireworks.</p>
        <p>Besides, the lines in the cafeteria at the Met are bound to be shorter than the ones for hot dogs at the celebration tonight.</p>
