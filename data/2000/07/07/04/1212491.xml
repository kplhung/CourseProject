        <p>At 11 p.m., with the returns showing that Vicente Fox Quesada had seized the presidency from the governing party, the man who went before the nation to concede defeat was not the losing candidate, but President Ernesto Zedillo.</p>
        <p>He said he had telephoned Mr. Fox to congratulate him on ''his triumph'' and promise him a ''transparent, clean and efficient'' handover on Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>In another country, a president whose crowning achievement was an election in which his party was humiliated would be regarded as a flop. But in Mexico, where the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, had been in command for seven decades, the loss won Mr. Zedillo a much greater war to transform this country into a working democracy.</p>
        <p>''Today we have shown for all to see that ours is a nation of free men and women who believe in the means of democracy and law to achieve progress,'' Mr. Zedillo told viewers astonished by Mr. Fox's showing.</p>
        <p>In his six years as president, Mr. Zedillo has been dogged in pursuing the goals of political reform that he set forth early in his term, knowing that they could ultimately lead his party into a political winter. Enrique Krauze, a historian of the Mexican presidency, recalls a meeting in 1995 at which Mr. Zedillo, still fresh in the job, asked him to look over the draft of the speech in which he would propose a broad change in the Mexican electoral system.</p>
        <p>Mexicans had long settled for the appearance of democracy. During decades when the PRI was untouchable, it held ritual elections every six years. When real parties formed in the 1980's, the PRI responded with bribery, influence peddling and sometimes, critics said, outright fraud to hold onto its power. Mr. Zedillo's own rise to office began in tragedy, the assassination of the PRI nominee in 1994. In these circumstances, Mexican democracy was always described as ''artificial'' or ''useless'' or ''dictatorial.''</p>
        <p>Looking over his notes, Mr. Krauze recalled, Mr. Zedillo mused, ''I am going to take all the adjectives out of Mexican democracy.''</p>
        <p>Five years later, he did. Mr. Fox owed his victory in no small measure to Mr. Zedillo.</p>
        <p>In his inaugural speech in 1994, the new president had implied deficiencies in his own election and said Mexico needed a fairer voting system. Two years later he pushed those electoral reforms through Congress, often over the furious objections of the opposition parties, like Mr. Fox's, who eventually benefited the most.</p>
        <p>The reforms created the independent elections agency that organized the voting on July 2, the fairest election in Mexico's history. They also provided nearly $1 billion in public financing for the parties' campaigns, so Mr. Fox was able to buy broadcast advertising time to blanket the country with his message of change.</p>
        <p>All along it was clear that the big loser in the reforms was Mr. Zedillo's own party. His policies amounted to an ultimatum. No longer was it the domineering PRI elite's job to spread the spoils. The president wanted the party to work for its votes.</p>
        <p>The need for an opening in Mexico was seared into Mr. Zedillo's awareness before he took office. His predecessor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, became president in 1988 in an election most Mexicans believe he won by fraud. The tainted mandate came back to haunt Mr. Salinas after his term ended when the currency collapsed and his legacy was instantly shattered, sending him into exile.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the man Mr. Salinas chose to succeed him, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was assassinated during his campaign when Mr. Zedillo was his manager. Although the homicide was never solved, there was no doubt that it came in the midst of a buildup of tension in the PRI because of the arbitrary method of the succession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo, 48, has always been an outsider in the PRI system. He was never part of what Mexicans call ''the revolutionary family,'' the  PRI elite. He comes from a family in the sand-blown border town of Mexicali, far from the power centers. Bookish, he rose through the government by discipline and hard work rather than the traditional clever upward manuevering through competing cliques.</p>
        <p>An economist by training, Mr. Zedillo kept his distance from the day-to-day horse trading in Mexico City, and so was often criticized as politically maladroit.</p>
        <p>''He is a quiet man, withdrawn from the palace politics,'' Mr. Krauze said. ''It gave him a lot of time to think.''</p>
        <p>Luis Tellez, the energy secretary who was Mr. Zedillo's chief of staff for three years, recalled that he had read every biography of Benito Juarez, a Zapotec Indian who became a great reformist Mexican president in the 19th century. Both presidents, Mr. Tellez said, were convinced that economic change had to go hand in hand with political opportunities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo has imposed some limits. Last year, he abandoned the practice of picking his party's presidential candidate. At his behest, the PRI ran its first competitive primary. Although four candidates ran, it was clear that Mr. Zedillo favored Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who had been his interior minister, the president's top political operator.</p>
        <p>The party faithful had no doubt who was supposed to win, and at the end of the race they piled on against the other three candidates. In a bizarre show, the PRI rank and file turned on their own brethren with the same vote-buying and pressure tactics they long had used on the opposition.</p>
        <p>While he remained largely aloof from Mr. Labastida's presidential drive, in the final weeks before the election Mr. Zedillo stepped in with some sharply partisan attacks on Mr. Fox and other contenders.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Zedillo emerged remarkably unscathed from the PRI's debacle at the ballot box. The Reforma newspaper, citing interviews with voters as they left the polls on Sunday after trashing Mr. Labastida, reported that 66 percent of them gave Mr. Zedillo a favorable review as president.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Zedillo is managing to end his term in a surprisingly strong position. His party's demise is being hailed as evidence of his democratic conviction.</p>
        <p>Jorge Castaneda, a close adviser to Mr. Fox, said that the winning candidate initiated the call to the president on Sunday night. Mr. Zedillo came right on the line to congratulate him.</p>
        <p>''From the first moment of contact Zedillo was careful, but relaxed,'' Mr. Castaneda said. ''He was very statesmanlike.''</p>
