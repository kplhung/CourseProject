        <p>One hundred and thirty-seven years after Union troops bested Gen. Robert E. Lee and his Confederate legions in their desperate gamble known as Pickett's charge, the National Park Service today demolished an observation tower that has been a magnet for criticism from historians, park officials and battlefield preservationists.</p>
        <p>At 5:02 this afternoon, after four minutes of delay and two countdowns, a group of Civil War re-enactors, some dressed in Confederate gray and others in Union blue, fired dummy charges toward the tower. Less than 10 seconds later, 15.5 pounds of demolition charges that had been placed on the tower exploded, collapsing the structure.</p>
        <p>Taking down the 307-foot structure, the Gettysburg National Tower, is the first step in an effort to restore the battlefield to its appearance in 1863, Park Service officials said.</p>
        <p>''This is sacred ground,'' the secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt said. ''Americans come here to learn of their past, to understand how it was in those days when we remade ourselves as a new nation.''</p>
        <p>Last year, while observing Earth Day at Gettysburg, Mr. Babbitt promised: ''This tower is coming down on my watch.''</p>
        <p>For nearly three decades, the tower, which was a privately operated tourist attraction, loomed over the battlefield. Union troops had once gathered near the site of the tower, setting up defensive positions on what was known as Cemetery Ridge. For years, preservationists and Civil War enthusiasts have criticized the tower as an intrusion on the historic setting.</p>
        <p>''It has been our long-term wish to get rid of what we consider a major eyesore,'' said Dr. Walter L. Powell, the president of the Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association.</p>
        <p>Controlled Demolition Inc. of Baltimore, donated its services and explosives to raze the tower, a donation the Park Service valued at $1 million. Park officials said the donation was the largest corporate contribution toward preservation in the park's 105-year history.</p>
        <p>In return, the company retained media and salvage rights for the collapsed steel tower. The company recently demolished the Kingdome in Seattle and the ruins of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</p>
        <p>A lawyer representing the company that had owned the tower, Overview Limited Partnership of Baltimore, criticized the demolition.</p>
        <p>''The government, for reasons yet to be articulated, has chosen to destroy a classroom in the sky,'' the lawyer, Irwin W. Aronson, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aronson said the demolition would actually cost only about $40,000, arguing that the $1 million government figure was grossly exaggerated.</p>
        <p>The strategy behind decisions made by the Union commander, Gen. George G. Meade, and General Lee, he said, could be appreciated only from the tower, which had opened in 1974 and included photographs and maps of the park.</p>
        <p>''It's the only vantage point to see the entire spectrum of the battlefield,'' Mr. Aronson said. For about $5, visitors could view the battlefield, which covered about six acres, from the tower.</p>
        <p>Betsy Hower, 52, an executive for a tour company in Adams County, Pa., where the battlefield is situated, said the demolition had caused ''more unrest than I've seen in the 22 years I've lived here.''</p>
        <p>''The citizens of this area don't believe that we need to take down the tower,'' Ms. Hower said.</p>
        <p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had tried to prevent construction of the tower because of its proximity to historic land. Then, in December 1999, the Department of Justice filed suit to acquire the property. The court granted the Park Service ownership in June, laying the groundwork for today's demolition.</p>
