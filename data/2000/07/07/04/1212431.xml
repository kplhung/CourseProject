        <p>Skirting a Vatican order to withdraw from a gay pride seminar on religion and homosexuality, Bishop Jacques Gaillot sat on a couch outside the hotel conference room today and explained where he thinks the Roman Catholic Church has erred.</p>
        <p>''The church should not have second-class citizens,'' said Bishop Gaillot, who is from France. ''Homosexuals have the same right to tolerance and dignity as any other group.'' He said he was called on Sunday by his French superiors and told that the pope had asked that he not take part in the seminar, just one event in the seven-day gay pride festival called World Pride Roma 2000.</p>
        <p>''I am being loyal and obedient to the pope,'' said Bishop Gaillot, who skipped the seminar but instead discussed the order with the news media. ''But the pope has done me a great service in creating an event out of me.'' The bishop, who was removed from his diocese in Evreux in 1995 for his leftist views, added with a twinkle, ''Nobody would be asking me for interviews had it not been for the pope' s intervention.''</p>
        <p>World Pride Roma 2000, which opened on Saturday, was timed to coincide with a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church. Vatican opposition elevated the gay event into a tense political battleground, pitting church leaders and many right-wing groups against organizers and defenders of gay rights.</p>
        <p>The Vatican's efforts to postpone the festival, and most recently, its effort to silence a bishop whose  views do not reflect its own, have focused attention less on gay pride than on the state of tolerance inside the Holy See.</p>
        <p>''There is a big difference in how the Vatican and American church leaders approach homosexuality,'' said Francis De Bernardo, a member of New Ways ministry, a religious association for gay Catholics. ''U.S. bishops want outreach.''</p>
        <p>He said he was not surprised by Rome's cold shoulder, citing the Vatican's efforts to silence Jeannine Gramick and Robert Nugent, a nun and priest who were ordered to end their ministry to gay men and lesbians in 1999. ''But this thing with Bishop Gaillot is disturbing. It shows there is not going to be even the hint of a conversation between the church and the gays gathering here.''</p>
        <p>So far, there has mainly been conflict between the two sides.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, as the Italian movie star Maria Grazia Cucinotta cut a rainbow-colored ribbon, alongside Vladimir Luxuria, Italy's best known drag queen, at the opening ceremony in the garden of the Philharmonic Academy in Rome, about 700 demonstrators marched trough central Rome with the neo-Fascist group Forza Nuova. As the riot police looked on, the group paraded noisily,  with Fascist salutes and and banners that read, ''no gay pride.''</p>
        <p>A Catholic association, Centro Culturale Lepando, and a right-wing party, National Alliance, organized a torchlight seven-mile walk by 1,000 people to offer ''penance'' for the gay pride event.</p>
        <p>At the Church of Saint Teresa of Avila in Rome, a small group of believers organized by the Committee for a Christian Rome recited a rosary to atone for the city's decision to allow the gay pride event.</p>
        <p>Today, riot policemen and bomb squads lined the entrance of the Hotel Cicerone, near the Vatican, where gay pride meetings were being held.</p>
        <p>The event, which organizers expect to draw more than 200,000 gay men and women to Rome, was planned three years ago and initially won the support of the city. But after the Vatican protested earlier this year, Mayor Francesco Rutelli tried to persuade World Pride organizers to postpone the event for a week. He contended that its schedule -- which includes conferences, drag fashion shows and a parade through Rome this Saturday -- could disturb the church's events for this Jubilee year.</p>
        <p>When the organizers refused, Mr. Rutelli said the events would go on as planned, but he withdrew the city's endorsement and its logo from the banners. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato broke with many leaders of his center-left coalition by saying the timing of the gay pride festival during a Holy Year was ''inopportune.''</p>
        <p>The Catholic Church does not teach that homosexuality is a sin, but that homosexual acts are sinful, just as adultery is. And the Vatican views the timing of the gay pride event as an offense to the church and to family values -- as well as a political cudgel.</p>
        <p>''It pains me to see that young people are being told that the church is their enemy,'' said Cardinal Ersilio Tonini, an emeritus archbishop who was one of the few church officials to address the issue on television over the weekend. ''For us, they are always our brothers and sons. But shouting about pride in this public event is not right. The church has to tell the truth, even if that truth is not fashionable.''</p>
        <p>The event expected to draw the most protest is the gay pride parade on Saturday, and the Colosseum has become the focus for the controversy.</p>
        <p>Organizers say they will march to the Colosseum and form a ring around it in defiance of the city, which refused to approve the streets around it as part of the parade route.</p>
        <p>Right-wing groups have said they will block marchers from surrounding the structure, which they view as a shrine to Christian martyrs. The Colosseum has also been adopted this year by human rights groups and the Catholic Church as a symbol in their fight against the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Historians say that no early Christians were actually fed to the lions in the Colosseum, but church lore and Hollywood movies have kept the legend alive. At the neo-Fascist counterdemonstration on Saturday, protesters held banners reading, ''Gays at the Colosseum? Only with Lions!''</p>
