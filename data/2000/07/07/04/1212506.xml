        <p>The Mets got six shutout innings from one struggling pitcher. Another followed by striking out the side.</p>
        <p>It was not Bobby J. Jones or Dennis Cook who allowed the runs in the game tonight, a 2-0 loss to the Florida Marlins. Turk Wendell, who has been one of the more reliable pitchers on the staff, surrendered a two-run homer to Derrek Lee with one out in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
        <p>Lee drilled a slider over the center-field fence after Mike Lowell had singled. ''I thought it was a pretty good pitch,'' Wendell said. ''I didn't get to admire it very long.''</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza extended his hitting streak to 21 games with a double in the eighth inning for the Mets, but his streak of 15 games with a run batted in ended. Piazza was two games away from tying a major league record set by Ray Grimes of the Chicago Cubs in 1922.</p>
        <p>Wendell (4-4) had been scored on only once in his previous seven appearances. But while he has had a fine season, he has been prone to allowing home runs. Lee's was the fourth game-winning home run Wendell has given up this year. San Francisco's Jeff Kent, Colorado's Bubba Carpenter and Los Angeles's Kevin Elster beat him with homers in May.</p>
        <p>''I've already had stuff like this happen this year, and tomorrow's a new day,'' Wendell said. ''It's just the way you kind of have to look at it.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' offense was shut out by three Marlins pitchers, including the former Mets prospect Jesus Sanchez, who worked eight scoreless innings. Armando Almanza (2-0) became the winning pitcher in relief after retiring Todd Pratt and Melvin Mora with a runner on second in the top of the ninth. The Mets were 0 for 11 with runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Piazza reflected on the end of his R.B.I. streak. ''It was just one of those weird kind of streaks,'' he said. ''It's obviously a point of interest, but it was a very frustrating night for us as a whole offensively.''</p>
        <p>Jones was one Met who was not frustrated. He has been a much different pitcher since accepting a 10-day assignment to Class AAA Norfolk in the middle of June. He started twice there, adjusted his delivery and came back with a sharper curveball and a fastball with better downward movement.</p>
        <p>In three starts since returning, Jones has pitched 20 innings, allowing 16 hits and 5 runs while striking out 16 and walking 3. Jones was magnificent tonight, overcoming an aggressive Marlins running game that put men in scoring position in the first, fourth, fifth and sixth innings.</p>
        <p>By paying less attention to mechanics, Manager Bobby Valentine said, Jones has been able to concentrate on simply making his pitches.</p>
        <p>''I'm definitely pitching better than I did in my first few starts, and I feel good out there; I feel I can make the pitches that I need to,'' Jones said. ''But I also believe my next start is just as important as this start. I never have that frame of mind where I sit back and say, 'O.K., I've got my good stuff now.' ''</p>
        <p>The Marlins stole four bases off Jones, including two by Preston Wilson. Wilson singled with two out in the fourth, then stole second with  Lowell batting. But Jones dropped to a sidearm delivery with two strikes, and Lowell bounced a breaking ball to first for the final out.</p>
        <p>Lee doubled off the left-field wall to open the fifth, then advanced to second when Alex Gonzalez bunted for a single. Jones tried to field it but slipped, and Gonzalez stole second. It was a dangerous spot and Jones survived, striking out Paul Bako, Sanchez and Luis Castillo, who fanned on a nasty slider.</p>
        <p>Jones gave way to Cook in the seventh, and Cook -- who has a 6.10 earned run average -- struck out all three Marlins he faced. John Franco pitched a scoreless eighth.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully it's something I can build on,'' Cook said. ''I threw the ball pretty good my last couple of outings, but you never know when you're back to wherever 'back' is.''</p>
        <p>The problem for Jones and Cook was that Sanchez was just as sharp. He had a live arm, Piazza said, and he succeeded by throwing his fastball up in the strike zone and changing speeds well.</p>
        <p>Piazza came up with runners at first and second and one out in the first inning and in the third. Both at-bats had the same result: a popout to short right field that advanced no runners. Both times, Sanchez retired the next hitter, Todd Zeile, to end the inning.</p>
        <p>While Piazza's streak has ended, he has established one record with his torrid run production. During the Mets' weekend split in a four-game series with the Atlanta Braves, he set a Mets record for runs batted in before the All-Star Game break. Piazza has 71 R.B.I., two more than Dave Kingman had at the break in 1976.</p>
        <p>Piazza was not the only Met to squander a chance to drive in runs tonight. Robin Ventura doubled to lead off the second inning, but Benny Agbayani popped up, Joe McEwing grounded out and Jones fanned.</p>
        <p>In the fifth, after Sanchez hit Jones to start the inning, Melvin Mora and Derek Bell struck out and Edgardo Alfonzo flied to left, ending another threat before it could really start.</p>
        <p>Sanchez lasted through the eighth, when he survived another Mets charge. Piazza lofted a two-out double off the left-field wall, and Zeile was intentionally walked. Then Sanchez got Ventura to fly to center, ending the inning.</p>
