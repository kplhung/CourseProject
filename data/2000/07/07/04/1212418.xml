        <p>After the 46 shows that made up the spring 2001 men's wear collections ended in Milan on June 29, one was tempted to calculate just how much it costs the fashion industry, and the press that brings back news of it, to present men with the possibility of pairing hot pants with knee socks, wearing metallic leather jumpsuits unzipped to the navel or styling their hair so that they look like female extras on ''The Dukes of Hazzard.''</p>
        <p>The bill -- a rough estimate -- is in the vicinity of $5.9 million. The figure takes into account about $60,000 to produce a catwalk show (more for those with the swankiest production values). It also considers the few thousand dollars in expenses that dozens of buyers and 312 journalists from 18 countries incur during a five-night stay.</p>

        <p>After the 46 shows that made up the spring 2001 men's wear collections ended in Milan on June 29, one was tempted to calculate just how much it costs the fashion industry, and the press that brings back news of it, to present men with the possibility of pairing hot pants with knee socks, wearing metallic leather jumpsuits unzipped to the navel or styling their hair so that they look like female extras on ''The Dukes of Hazzard.''</p>
        <p>The bill -- a rough estimate -- is in the vicinity of $5.9 million. The figure takes into account about $60,000 to produce a catwalk show (more for those with the swankiest production values). It also considers the few thousand dollars in expenses that dozens of buyers and 312 journalists from 18 countries incur during a five-night stay.</p>
        <p>What the number does not account for is the cost of lavish promotional dinners and parties given by the fashion houses, like the one Gucci held in Milan's main railroad terminal last week, which had Tom Ford dancing with Heather Graham. Nor does it account for the cost of luring celebrities like Ms. Graham to Italy in the first place. Nor does it include mini-bar raids made after hours at the Hotel Principe di Savoia, center of fashion-week social activity and home of the $15 airline-size bottle of Absolut.</p>
        <p>All this spending results in little with which the modern man might build a broad and efficient wardrobe. This is not to say that there are not some labels that still respect the notion of wearability. At Burberry, Roberto Manichetti again turned out handsome jackets in plaid and quietly patterned leather. He also managed a memorably arch tuxedo, in shiny cotton with pointy lapels, which nonetheless bore no traces of goofiness. Prada showed narrow, short-cropped pleated trousers and uncomplicated beachwear, all of which stayed within the realm of the smart and sensible. And Neil Barrett, a former Prada designer now on his own, proved with boxy zippered jackets of waxed linen and leather, among other styles, that he is not simply out for a lark.</p>
        <p>But what is ultimately played out each season on runways devoted to men is something else: the frivolous resurrection of one male archetype or another from a preciously thin catalog. What will it be this time, one wonders? The pinky-ringed Harvard senior? The aspiring biker? The seemingly neutered Carnaby Street lad? The disaffected Midwestern stud with a tenure at Dairy Queen on his resume?</p>
        <p>Or as it happened last week, the airily coiffed man-boy, whose open shirts, tight sweaters and gold accessories suggest that he is for sale?</p>
        <p>When fashion spectacles offer so little that can be taken seriously, there is really no other way to judge them than by the self-parody they achieve. The Versace show, by this measure, was the week's most entertaining. It put the archetypal male hustler in shirts with wild prints and plunging necklines, tight pink and purple shantung suits and zigzag-pattern knit briefs. Nor did it forget to give him big sunglasses and bigger hair. The overall image was absurd enough to overshadow the sordidness at its root.</p>
        <p>With this show Donatella Versace accomplished something more purely Versace-esque than she did with her last ''Fight Club'' collection. ''If Gianni is looking down,'' said Stefano Tonchi, Esquire's fashion director, ''he is smiling.''</p>
        <p>At Fendi, where models wore wide-leg, beltless, low-slung pants, small purses and tight-fitting knits as they slouched down the runway, another editor commented that the hustler on view seemed of a very particular sort: Via Veneto, circa 1973. Eric Wright, who is Karl Lagerfeld's primary creative hand at Fendi and who designed the men's wear line for the first time, said his inspiration came from the typical Roman, so infatuated with his own good looks. ''They are all hustlers in a sense,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
        <p>And at Byblos, models in gold chain belts and bracelets made a similar point.</p>
        <p>Last season, D Squared, the cultish, five-year old label designed by Dean and Dan Caten, Canadian twins, paraded models wearing exceptionally low-slung jeans, who were chauffeured down the runway in monster trucks. This season they held their show in an open-air Milan discotheque and offered drinks, fruit kebabs and models in gold leather jeans, tight gold basketball shorts and sliced leather shirt-vests.</p>
        <p>''The theme was Tony Monero in Mykonos,'' Dean Caten said, referring to John Travolta's character in ''Saturday Night Fever.'' ''That's where he'd go after he won the dance contest,'' Mr. Caten added. ''Maybe he ran out of money on the vacation.''</p>
        <p>And Dolce &amp; Gabanna showed men in tight tank tops and caps, gold thong sandals and gold- and silver-embellished pants.</p>
        <p>However cliched the hustler reference might seem, it is one that never seems to lose its aptness to the fashion business, a world where favors are really exchanges and the beautiful always get more. Last week, Gucci flew in celebrities to grace the front row of its men's show for the first time. It played host to Ms. Graham, who brought a friend, the comedian Molly Shannon. Dylan McDermott came. And so, too, did the actor Matthew McConaughey, who also brought a friend, another actor, Cole Hauser. All were put up at the Principe, wined and dined and, one evening, toured around Lake Como.</p>
        <p>Mr. McConaughey's late-night exploits provided much of the week's chatter, directing more attention to him than to the company that paid the tariff. At one point, he remained at the Principe's bar till 11 in the morning, two fashion people said. At 8 a.m., he called his official Gucci handler and asked to have the Gucci retail store opened so that he could do some shopping. The weary young woman explained he would have to wait until the scheduled opening at 10.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Ford hoped to gain from the presence of an actor arguably less famous than he is remained one of the week's presiding mysteries. In fact, Mr. McConaughey's peripheral antics were so entertaining that few editors seemed to find time to discuss Mr. Ford's collection.</p>
        <p>Which was fortunate, in a way. Throughout his career, Mr. Ford has given birth again and again to the somewhat degenerate 1970's glamour boy that so many designers embraced last week. Although it was smart for him to move on, what he delivered instead were incomprehensible clothes lacking his usual keen irony. There were kimono-inspired shirts, baggy drawstring leather pants, baggy, painted jeans and swimming trunks that looked like the male answer to the string bikini. It felt as though Mr. Ford had thrown this together the morning after an all-nighter of kung fu movies.</p>
        <p>''It's all a bit twisted, no?'' Mr. Tonchi, the Esquire editor, said of the hustler look that typified the season. ''A bit corrupt.''</p>
        <p>Nearly a decade of sustained affluence has led fashion people to grow bored with the commodification of genteel sensibilities that has attended it. Prada's spring 2000 ''Belle du Jour'' collection, with its allusions to the bourgeois woman who longs to come undone, subversively tapped into such a mood. By the time the fall 2000 collections took place last February, fashion was selling well-to-do women an image of themselves bordering on the vulgar and predatory. The reference was the 80's and the brittle Alexis Carrington sort determined to sleep her way into a destiny grander than the one life was going to provide. It only makes sense that men would eventually receive the same treatment.</p>
        <p>But do the wealthy truly hunger for the decadence that fashion would prescribe for them? If you were to use as a yardstick ''The Millionaire Mind,'' a best-selling study of how the real rich live and think, there appears to be no yearning for life styles more piquant than the mundane ones people already lead. Research on what millionaires do with their off-hours concludes that the No. 1 favorite activity is ''consultling with a tax expert.'' Casino gambling and yachting rank 17th and 20th, respectively.</p>
