        <p>Internet executives hire their parents and traditions fall; it has become less unusual, among Internet start-up companies, for chief executives to hire their parents; two main causes for this reversal of tradition: typical start-up CEO is 30 years old, and labor shortage in this sector is pronounced; article profiles examples of parents working for their children; photos (M)</p>

        <p>In some ways Lucille Lee is typical of many people who have cast their lot with Silicon Valley start-ups. Early last year, after many years as a software systems architect at I.B.M., she joined eCircles.com, a service based in San Mateo, Calif., for building virtual meeting places, where she puts in 60 to 70 hours a week as director of applications development.</p>
        <p>But almost every week Ms. Lee has the company's chief executive over for Sunday dinner. Although she does not report directly to him, she often brings up work-related concerns, but when she does this, he squirms, telling her he would rather not discuss work. This usually goes on a bit until Ms. Lee's husband chimes in to admonish their guest: ''Prescott, listen to your mom.''</p>
        <p>At age 67, Ms. Lee is working for her son, who is 38. And her situation is not all that unusual anymore. In the world of Internet start-ups, where a typical chief executive is 30 and a labor shortage continues even as some Web companies fail, in many cases dot-commers are recruiting their own parents.</p>
        <p>These 30-somethings belong to a generation that came of age comfortable with both technology and the risks that come with entrepreneurship. Most of their parents are still in the work force, many of them years from retirement.</p>
        <p>Some say they decided to work for their children's companies because their skills and experience were a good fit. A few say they find the potential financial rewards attractive. But most do it for the most time-honored of reasons: who can say no to a child who needs you?</p>
        <p>In the process, this curious form of reverse nepotism is upending traditional notions about family businesses, where the younger generations work their way up the ladder. It is also bringing a new dimension to child-parent relationships and the questions of authority and approval that usually define them.</p>
        <p>''This is really new,'' said Mary J. Waller, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who studies organizational behavior.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waller noted that except in smaller, family-owned businesses, nepotism has generally been frowned upon in American companies. But many young and inexperienced dot-com executives, she said, are the children of successful entrepreneurs who can offer valuable advice and experience.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most famous recent example of a parental recruit is William H. Gates Jr., father of Microsoft's chairman. The elder Mr. Gates, a 74-year-old lawyer, is co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropic foundation.</p>
        <p>The position grew out of a conversation a few years ago with his son and daughter-in-law during a night at the movies. After that evening, the elder Mr. Gates offered to help his son with his philanthropic efforts.</p>
        <p>For many other parents, it starts with a more active call for help.</p>
        <p>Such was the case with Josie Herron, a 55-year-old database designer who uprooted herself from West Palm Beach, Fla., last January to join the payroll of Mercury2, an e-commerce company in San Francisco. Her daughter, Christine Herron, a former venture capitalist and graduate of Stanford Business School is the company's founder and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Over lunch recently at a cafe close to Mercury2's offices south of Market Street, the elder Ms. Herron, looking slightly out of place amid the relentless hipness of the restaurant, and her daughter, a 30-year-old clearly in her element, talked about how the recruitment took place.</p>
        <p>''There was a shameless lobbying,'' said Josie Herron. ''Heavy guilt on the 'Mom, I need you.' ''</p>
        <p>''You use what works with different people,'' responded Christine Herron, a broad, mischievous smile on her face. ''I know what works with you.''</p>
        <p>Marc H. Bell, 32, who is chairman and chief executive of the Globix Corporation, an Internet infrastructure concern in New York, was also in need of help. Both of Mr. Bell's parents -- who have been amicably separated but not divorced for more than 10 years -- now work for him.</p>
        <p>The first to join the company, in 1995, was Mr. Bell's father, Robert, 61, an experienced real estate lawyer who started giving informal advice as the company was being started and eventually signed on as executive vice president of business development.</p>
        <p>That has not always been an easy situation to adjust to. ''When my father came on board, the dynamic was a little weird because my father was working for me,'' Marc Bell said. ''It required finding boundaries. There are definitely some tense moments. ''</p>
        <p>Yet, he said, at the same time, ''there's no one you can better trust than family.''</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Bell did not ask for any shares when the company was formed. He later took options, the company went public in 1996 and today he is a multimillionaire. Now 600 employees strong, Globix has made Marc Bell far wealthier; his stock in the company is worth about $185 million today.</p>
        <p>''What you have in our situation is a pendulum where it's swung from one end to the other,'' said the elder Mr. Bell. ''It evolved from son coming to father for advice to a father taking total direction from his son.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell's mother, Ruth, 58, who coordinates events for the company, was a more difficult recruit. It took several years before Mr. Bell finally convinced her to join the company. She was happy running her own small business producing what her son calls ''crystal tchotchkes'' and what she describes as ''hand-crafted personal accessory items.''</p>
        <p>Finally, in 1998, she relented. Her nickname around the company is the Corporate Mom.</p>
        <p>When a company is just starting out, and one's parents get involved, the financial and emotional stakes can be enormous, and young entrepeneurs may want more than a parent's expertise.</p>
        <p>''It means a lot to me to have not just my mortgage on the line but my mom's mortgage as well,'' said Courtney Rosen, 33, chief executive of eHow.com, a how-to Web site with 80 full-time employees and 200 freelancers. Ms. Rosen's mother, Roberta Kramer, 61, works there as a senior editor.</p>
        <p>Understandably, investors and colleagues are often skeptical of such arrangements at first. ''Everyone wants to know, 'Is this a family business I'm getting involved in, or what?' said Matthew Josefewicz, 27, chief executive of Chapbooks.com, a start-up in Boston that produces books in small quantities. ''The answer is definitely 'or what,' '' Both his parents now work for him.</p>
        <p>But, say many chief executives, the skepticism usually fades once a parent's credentials are trotted out. Further, it doesn't hurt to demonstrate that at least one highly experienced ''gray-hair,'' as employees over the age of 40 or so are generally referred to at start-ups, can be found in the company's ranks.</p>
        <p>That same experience, however, can breed discord. Mr. Bell, who describes his father as a ''strong-headed person,'' recalled several disagreements over the years. Gradually, the elder Mr. Bell has come to defer more readily to his son. ''This is a Marc company, this is not a Bob company,'' said the elder Mr. Bell. ''He is the brains behind it, and I accept that and I respect it. Some fathers don't want to let go.''</p>
        <p>In a variation on the theme of recruiting one's parents, said Mr. Josefewicz, his father and a small group of friends had the idea for Chapbooks.com and turned to him in 1998 when they were seeking someone to run it. ''My parents have run their own business and don't want to be doing that again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Josefewicz said that early in the company's life, he and his parents had ''one or two major disagreements I'm not comfortable sharing in print.'' But those differences were quickly resolved, he said, and all has since gone smoothly.</p>
        <p>Compensation negotiations can be awkward. Mr. Bell said that neither parent seemed pleased with the stock options he offered them. ''Everybody always wants more,'' he said. Both parents, however, say they are perfectly happy with their compensation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosen of eHow.com said her mother was surprisingly tough. ''She negotiated really well,'' said Ms. Rosen. ''She did a great job.'' The negotiations did not take place directly between mother and daughter, said Ms. Rosen, but with the company's vice president of operations, who happens to be Ms. Rosen's husband.</p>
        <p>Josie Herron refused to negotiate altogether. ''She said, 'Just pay me what I'm worth,' '' recalled Christine Herron.</p>
        <p>Many chief executives of companies still in their infancy and short of cash are offering their parent-employees the choice of salaries or stock options. Ms. Lee, for instance, has chosen to take more of her compensation in options and less in salary, which she considers an extra vote of confidence for her son.</p>
        <p>Deeply rooted patterns that can be found in most parent-child relationships are also difficult to shut out completely. Mr. Lee, for instance, often criticizes his mother for her pessimistic tendencies, he said, adding that it isn't until his co-workers tell him that he is being too judgmental that he rethinks his position. ''Part of the problem we all have with our moms is we expect them to be perfect,'' Mr. Lee confessed.</p>
        <p>For parents, pride in one's children, as natural an instinct as a parent can have, is hard to avoid when working together so closely.  ''Sometimes we're at the same meeting and every once in a while I'll get that rush, that motherly pride thing mixed with love,'' said Josie Herron. ''But I only let that last a second, and I say to myself, 'that's enough now, we can't do that at work, and I focus right back to where we were.' ''</p>
        <p>And, not least, there is the question of what to call Mom or Dad, in meetings or the workplace. For a while, Mr. Bell tried saying ''Ruth'' and ''Bob'' but soon gave up. ''I realized that was just silly,'' he said. ''No matter how much I want to deny it, it's a fact -- they're my parents.''</p>
        <p>His difficulties are typical, as is the tendency to revert to habit. Mr. Lee said that in more formal settings, such as meetings, he usually addresses his mother as ''Lucille.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''when we start disagreeing on something, I switch right back to 'Mom.' ''</p>
        <p>And what if, in the midst of the current wave of dot-com failures and layoffs, it becomes necessary to hand a pink slip to the very person who used to set your curfews and order you to clean your plate?</p>
        <p>''If I had to lay my mom off, I would be in a horrible situation,'' said Mr. Lee. ''My mom would understand but I know that deep down she would also be hurt.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Herron said she, too, had thought about this. ''If something were to happen to the business, though I feel responsible for the well-being of the entire team here, naturally there's more angst associated with letting down your mom.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Herron said that given her mother's experience, she would have no trouble finding another job. All the same, she said, ''Until she was settled into something else, I would be quite on edge -- more so than if I was unsettled myself.''</p>
