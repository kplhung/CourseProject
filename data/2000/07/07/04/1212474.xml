        <p>Does the Americans With Disabilities Act trump the authority of golf's organizing bodies to make their own rules? Or are professional golf organizations exempt from the act because the competitive nature of the sport would be forever changed?</p>
        <p>The PGA Tour has asked the United States Supreme Court to review these questions in its petition seeking review in the Casey Martin golf-cart lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The Tour said it needs clarification of the Americans With Disabilities Act because this year two federal appeals courts interpreted the act differently. The Tour argues that the golf's governing bodies oversee the rules of their competitions.</p>
        <p>The cases centered on two professional golfers, both with congenital degenerative circulatory diseases that prevent them from walking in tournaments. Golf's organizing bodies are hoping the Supreme Court will resolve the conflict the Tour and the United States Golf Association now face in the many states where their tournaments are held and where different rulings apply.</p>
        <p>In one case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco permitted Martin, who now plays on the PGA Tour, the right to use a cart because he has a rare disorder that has deformed his right leg. The act applied to Martin, the appeals court said, because PGA Tour events, even ''within the ropes'' and involving the most elite players in the world, are held at a public accommodation.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago ruled that Ford Olinger, a golf pro from Indiana who has a degenerative hip, was not entitled to a cart for qualifying events for the United States Open because a cart would change the nature of the competition. These decisions, the court ruled, were ''best left to those who hold the future of golf in trust.''</p>
        <p>This unsettled state of affairs became even more complicated in May when a Texas resident who has polio, JaRo Jones, sued the U.S.G.A. in federal court in Austin for the right to use a cart to qualify for the United States Senior Open.</p>
        <p>Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of Jones, in a case that is similar to Olinger's. Texas is part of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and thus the Olinger decision did not apply. Even with a cart, Jones shot an 84 and did not qualify.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently denied Olinger's request for a rehearing before its entire bench. The stage is now set for Olinger to appeal to the Supreme Court. Olinger's lawyer, John C. Hamilton, has said he will do so.</p>
        <p>At least three members of the Supreme Court are known to be golfers -- Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony M. Kennedy. Four votes are needed to accept a case for review. The court may act by October.</p>
