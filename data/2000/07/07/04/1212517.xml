        <p>As the sun was setting last Wednesday, two hours after the lifeguards had left their perches along Rockaway Beach in Queens and whistled everyone out of the water, the Atlantic Ocean, wild and menacing as it can be on that vast sandy stretch of New York City, was still too tempting for some to resist.</p>
        <p>Among the handful of people still in the sea were a couple from Flushing, who had walked down to the water's edge about 8 p.m., jumped in, swam about 30 feet offshore, and bobbed and splashed in the water for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>After the woman came out of the water, she said she found the beach too crowded during peak hours and was desperate for a swim that night. ''I don't know if it's safe or not,'' she said. ''But I'm not afraid.''</p>
        <p>Yet she was braving the ocean's fierce waves just four days after a Manhattan woman and her 6-year-old daughter had drowned several miles west on that same beach, in an area that is so rough with riptides that the lifeguards call it the ''death trap.'' And last Friday, an 11-year-old Queens boy drowned after swimming in an area of Jamaica Bay called Norton Basin, on the other side of the peninsula in Far Rockaway, where swimming is not allowed and lifeguards are never stationed.</p>
        <p>The drownings underscore a dark but seemingly inevitable side to summer: some people tempt their fate in the water, whether unwittingly taking risks or brazenly defying the rules, and lose their lives every year.</p>
        <p>The number of deaths may ebb and flow. Local parks departments may strengthen their patrols, hire more lifeguards -- although New York City has struggled with a shortage -- or post more warning signs around their beaches in response to a drowning. But as officials face the grim possibility of more drownings this summer, they say that the ocean cannot be locked up or the seduction of the water stamped out.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen people have drowned in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut since Memorial Day, most after venturing into the ocean, lakes or ponds when lifeguards were off duty or after swimming into areas that were off limits .</p>
        <p>On Long Beach in Nassau County, where the three miles of beach is easily accessible from a boardwalk, like Rockaway and Coney Island, three people drowned last year while swimming after the lifeguards were off duty, and three weeks ago, 15 minutes after lifeguards left at 6 p.m., a 12-year-old boy from Canarsie, Brooklyn, was lost in the water and drowned.</p>
        <p>Bruce Nyman, city manager of Long Beach, said there are one or two drownings at the beach a year, typically when the lifeguards, who work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., are off duty. ''I think that the U.S. Army couldn't keep people off our beaches at night,'' he said. ''I wish there was a way we could close our water.''</p>
        <p>While many people heed the warning signs, like those along Rockaway Beach that say swimming is prohibited without a lifeguard, those who take the risks think, ''It won't happen to me,'' said a Rockaway Beach lifeguard, Omar Santiago.</p>
        <p>Typically more drownings occur on ocean beaches, like Rockaway, which stretches seven miles along the eastern edge of the city, and Coney Island in Brooklyn, which has many entrances along the street that make it easy to walk onto the sand and jump in the water at any time of day or night. But rivers, lakes and basins beckon thrill seekers and people escaping the heat or the crowds of the guarded beaches. In Connecticut, several drownings have occurred this year in rivers and ponds.</p>
        <p>In the city last year, three people drowned off city beaches, two of them when there were no lifeguards on duty. Both drowned in the morning, before lifeguards went on duty at 10, one at Coney Island and the other at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, said officials from the City Parks and Recreation Department. The department is in charge of safety on the city's 12 miles of public beaches, including Coney Island, Rockaway and Orchard Beaches and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Last month, Orchard was the scene of another death when a teenager jumped off his boat for a swim, 200 feet offshore, and drowned.</p>
        <p>In response to the Rockaway drownings, the Parks Department has extended beach patrols to 8:30 p.m. from 6 p.m. Rangers in four-wheel drive vehicles roll across the sand at Brighton Beach, Coney Island and Rockaway Beach to order defiant bathers to leave the water. The patrols were not deployed to Orchard Beach, parks officials said, because the Police Department covers that area.</p>
        <p>Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, said that rule-breaking in city pools and beaches ''is an issue we've been plagued with for years,'' but that he is aware that the evening patrols, which were begun this year, can do only so much.</p>
        <p>''You do what you can to prevent tragedies,'' he said, ''but unfortunately, people simply motivated by the desire to cool off can jeopardize their lives. It's very sad.''</p>
        <p>It was easy to see on Wednesday night that Rockaway, because of its expanse and easy access, is a difficult beach to patrol. Five girls were playing in the surf, and the rangers had to ride up to them three times before they finally left. When the couple from Flushing was bobbing in the water, the rangers' vehicle was crawling along the eastern end of the beach, miles away, and the officers did not discover them.</p>
        <p>At Brighton Beach on Saturday night, between 7 and 8, the beach was still packed, and the water filled with dozens of swimmers. They had either been chased out by lifeguards or told to leave by the park patrol, but they had simply waited until the lifeguards and rangers were out of sight and had returned to the water.</p>
        <p>Kathy Santana and her three children, who live in the George Watston Houses on East 97th Street in Manhattan, ventured to the beach by subway to have dinner -- spaghetti and meatballs out of a large thermos -- and take an evening swim. It was about 7:30, and Ms. Santana kept an eye on her children, especially her 9-year-old son, Edwin Espinosa. Edwin announced, ''I like the waves and I go far,'' wolfed down some spaghetti and rushed back into the water.</p>
        <p>''I know it's dangerous,'' Ms. Santana said. ''But they like to play. And I watch to make sure they don't go too far.''</p>
        <p>She turned to the water, spotted her son and screamed, ''Edwin!''</p>
        <p>He turned to look at her and paddled back toward the shore.</p>
