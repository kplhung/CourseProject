        <p>With a rebounding deficiency having paved their way to an early postseason exit, the Knicks hope to secure a menacing power forward during this month of shopping and recruiting in the National Basketball Association. While Sacramento's Chris Webber, who is not a free agent, would be a dream acquisition, the Knicks have their eyes set on two more realistic possibilities, Portland's Brian Grant and Boston's Danny Fortson.</p>
        <p>Grant is the top choice, and an official in the Eastern Conference  said the Knicks have offered to send Marcus Camby and Chris Childs to the Blazers in a sign-and-trade deal for Grant. Mark Bartelstein, Grant's agent, said no such offer had been made, but said the Knicks have shown interest in his client, who recently opted out of the final four years -- $38 million of his contract -- because of his lack of playing time behind Rasheed Wallace.</p>

        <p>With a rebounding deficiency having paved their way to an early postseason exit, the Knicks hope to secure a menacing power forward during this month of shopping and recruiting in the National Basketball Association. While Sacramento's Chris Webber, who is not a free agent, would be a dream acquisition, the Knicks have their eyes set on two more realistic possibilities, Portland's Brian Grant and Boston's Danny Fortson.</p>
        <p>Grant is the top choice, and an official in the Eastern Conference  said the Knicks have offered to send Marcus Camby and Chris Childs to the Blazers in a sign-and-trade deal for Grant. Mark Bartelstein, Grant's agent, said no such offer had been made, but said the Knicks have shown interest in his client, who recently opted out of the final four years -- $38 million of his contract -- because of his lack of playing time behind Rasheed Wallace.</p>
        <p>''The Knicks have inquired about Brian, but I wouldn't go much further than that,'' Bartelstein said. ''They obviously think the world of him as a player but it's just very preliminary at this point.''</p>
        <p>One of the ways the Knicks and other teams show interest in a player is by sending him a team jersey with his name on the back. Fortson received his white, blue and orange Knicks jersey this weekend and grew almost giddy about the idea of yanking down rebounds for the home team in Madison Square Garden, according to a person close to the Celtics forward.</p>
        <p>A sign-and-trade deal involving Fortson is unlikely because of base-year compensation issues, but the Knicks may be able to sign him for the $2.25 million exception.</p>
        <p>While Grant and Fortson received jerseys, Grant Hill, the free agent the Knicks most covet, is expected to receive royal treatment whenever he visits the Knicks. The club hopes to entertain Hill within the next week and a half, and some of the celebrities who sit courtside during games at the Garden are expected to make personal pitches.</p>
        <p>It will likely all be for naught as Hill will probably go to Orlando or remain in Detroit for one season, but the Knicks must attempt to improve themselves at all costs. The feeling around the league is that, after sitting idle for much of last season, General Manager Scott Layden feels the need to make a major move.</p>
        <p>One member of the Knicks organization said the club had recently inquired about a sign-and-trade with the Los Angeles Clippers involving Derek Anderson, their free-agent shooting guard, and Camby. Acquiring Anderson makes no sense for the Knicks, who are well stocked at shooting guard, so they may be looking into a three-team deal.</p>
        <p>What seems clear is that the Knicks are shopping Camby, who had a disappointing regular and postseason after emerging as a force during the 1999 playoffs.</p>
        <p>If any sign-and-trade deals are made, they will not be made official until Aug. 1, the first day that free agents can sign new contracts.</p>
