        <p>Stocks rose broadly in light preholiday trading yesterday as investors digested the first important data of the month, a lower-than-expected reading for manufacturing activity in June.</p>
        <p>The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June, below analysts' expectations and May's number of 53.2. The latest number signaled that the economy may be slowing and provided further evidence for those who think the Federal Reserve will not have to extend its string of interest rate increases.</p>
        <p>The figure slightly buoyed a session of sluggish trading that ended early, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m. The three main gauges all rose, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 112.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,560.67; the Nasdaq composite index edging up 25.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,991.93; and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index climbing 14.72 points, or 1 percent, to 1,469.32.</p>
        <p>Volume was one of the slowest for a trading session this year, with 452 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. Five stocks rose for every two that fell on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. 500 received a lift from Conseco, the beleaguered insurance and financial services company, whose shares slid 45.3 percent in the first half of the year as its chief executive and chief financial officer resigned. Last week, Conseco named a former General Electric executive, Gary C. Wendt, as its chief executive, and its stock rose 1 5/16, or 16.7 percent, to 11 3/16.</p>
        <p>Shares of other financial services companies rose on the manufacturing report. J. P. Morgan rose 5 5/8, to 115  3/4, and Citigroup gained 2 1/16, to 62 7/16.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq was held back by Oracle, which fell 3 7/8, or 4.6 percent, to 80 3/16, after the resignation over the weekend of its president and chief operating officer, Raymond J. Lane.</p>
        <p>The market will be closed today in observance of the Fourth of July, but investors will be keeping an eye on critical employment data coming out on Friday and the beginning of the earnings season. Next week, companies like Yahoo and General Electric will report results and the closely watched Producer Price Index will be released.</p>
        <p>So far, opinions are mixed on whether signals of slowdown seen in the first half of the year will continue.</p>
        <p>''The Federal Reserve has labeled the signs of deceleration as tentative,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Bank of America Securities. ''Therefore, all eyes will be on the numbers to see if they'll confirm the trend of deceleration, or if they will concern the Fed. The Fed is clearly uncomfortable in indicating they are moving to the sidelines.''</p>
        <p>The disposition of the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, toward interest rates is key to the direction of the market. As one prominent technology investor, Alberto W. Vilar of the $7.5 billion Amerindo Investment Advisors, put it, ''Tell me a money manager that doesn't listen to Uncle Alan.''</p>
        <p>The June manufacturing number of 51.8 should be more palatable to the Fed than earlier results, said Joseph Liro, chief economist for Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates. Though a reading above 50 signals that the manufacturing economy is expanding, the June number was the lowest since January of last year. Mr. Liro thinks the ideal range for the index is between 52 and 54.</p>
        <p>''That's a range everybody would be happy with,'' he said, adding that it is a level with ''strong enough growth to keep incomes high,'' but not so much growth to aggravate inflation. The question, Mr. Liro says, is whether or not the manufacturing number will stay in that range, continue to shrink or revert back to its higher levels.</p>
        <p>While the manufacturing data indicated a continued slowdown, news about earnings did not. About 57 percent of the 312 companies that have preannounced their results have said they would be lower than expected. That, says Charles L. Hill, director of research for First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings, is a ''business as usual'' figure. More positive is the forecast of a 19.2 percent growth rate for second-quarter earnings for the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>''The earnings numbers don't indicate things are cooling off,'' said Mr. Hill, adding that the effects of the most recent rate increase would not be felt until next year.</p>
        <p>''We're in a period of some confusion right now, trying to sort all this out,'' he said.</p>
