        <p>The Islanders continued their active off-season yesterday by signing Kevin Haller, a free-agent defenseman who played with Anaheim last season.</p>

        <p>The Islanders continued their active off-season yesterday by signing Kevin Haller, a free-agent defenseman who played with Anaheim last season.</p>
        <p>''I did not want to get through the first day of free agency without snaring one of the three guys on my hit list,'' Islanders General Manager Mike Milbury said of Haller, 29, who has played 11 seasons in the National Hockey League and was a member of the 1993 Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you right now we're thrilled we are able to accomplish what we set out to accomplish in terms of a defenseman,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 67 games with the Mighty Ducks last season, the hard-hitting Haller had 3 goals, 5 assists and 61 penalty minutes. Haller, who also played for Buffalo, Montreal, Philadelphia and Hartford-Carolina, has 40 goals and 132 points in his career, along with 849 penalty minutes.</p>
        <p>The Islanders also signed center Mike Stapleton, who spent last season with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers.</p>
        <p>Haller was signed to a three-year contract with a club option, while the 34-year-old Stapleton, who had 10 goals and 12 assists in 62 games last season, was signed to a two-year contract, Milbury said.</p>
        <p>''I was a little surprised Kevin jumped on board without testing the waters,'' Milbury said. ''In previous years when we've gone to take a look at various free agents, they may have been high on our list but we weren't necessarily high on their list. Kevin clearly had options.''</p>
        <p>Haller, who has seen his ice time dwindle somewhat over the past few seasons, said he was looking forward to next season.</p>
        <p>''I enjoy the role of coming to a team that's on its way up,'' he said.  ''There's new ownership, new excitement to the team. I'm excited about that.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders, who finished last in the Atlantic Division at 24-49-9 last season with an austerity budget of $16.9 million, were sold this spring to Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates, who pledged to improve the team by spending with a purpose.</p>
