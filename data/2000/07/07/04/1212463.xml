        <p>Two star football players at the United States Naval Academy were charged today with raping a female midshipman at a party off-campus, the police and officials at the academy said.</p>
        <p>The football players, Cordrea Brittingham and Arion Keith Williams, both 21, were charged with raping and committing other sexual offenses against a fellow student who had passed out after drinking at a party in suburban Arnold, Md.</p>
        <p>The woman, whose name was not released, awoke to find herself being assaulted and pushed the men away, said Sgt. Joe Jordan, a spokesman for the Anne Arundel County Police. She was treated at a local hospital after midnight Friday.</p>
        <p>The two midshipmen, who had just completed their sophomore year at the academy in Annapolis, were being held on $250,000 bond. If convicted of second-degree rape, they would face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, Sergeant Jordan said. It was unclear whether the women knew the men, he said.</p>
        <p>The incident is likely to revive a new round of soul-searching at the academy, which has grappled with a prominent cheating scandal and various crimes over the last decade.</p>
        <p>The case could also renew debate over what some critics view as a climate of privilege and leniency that surrounds the academy's most valued athletes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, a cornerback from Detroit who is studying naval architecture, is considered one of the team's best athletes, according to a Web site of the Naval Academy's sports programs. Known by the nickname Bas, he started in 11 of Navy's 12 games last season and had more than 60 tackles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brittingham, a running back from Berlin, Md. who is studying economics, is known as one of the fastest players on the team and has ''an impressive 40-inch vertical leap,'' the team site says.</p>
        <p>An academy spokeswoman declined today to say whether the academy had taken any action against the two midshipmen. She referred inquiries to the police.</p>
        <p>Although local police officials said they could not recall similar incidents at the academy recently, the campus was rocked by a series of scandals during the 1990's. The most prominent case involved the theft of an examination for electrical engineering in December 1992, in which 133 midshipmen were found to have violated the honor code by lying to cover up the theft.</p>
        <p>During one three-week period in 1996, a midshipman was arrested for assaulting four female students, another student was charged with sexually abusing a toddler, and two midshipmen and three former academy students were indicted for operating a car theft ring.</p>
        <p>Investigating the series of problems, a 20-member panel led by the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Adm. Stansfield Turner, later concluded there was no ''systemic flaw'' at the military college.</p>
