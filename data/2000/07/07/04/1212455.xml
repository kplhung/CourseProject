        <p>The pilot of a small plane towing an advertising banner was killed yesterday in a crash at a municipal airport near the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>The pilot, Robert Lewis, 44, of Omaha, was pronounced dead at Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J., shortly after his plane crashed at 12:30 p.m. on the runway at Lakewood Airport, said Chief Michael Lynch of the Lakewood police.</p>
        <p>A Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, Jim Peters, said initial reports indicated that there might have been a passenger, but Chief Lynch said the pilot was the only one on board.</p>
        <p>The cause of the crash is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, Mr. Peters said.</p>
        <p>Greg Sakowitz, the first assistant Ocean County prosecutor, said he had been told that the plane was taking off when it crashed. The plane, an Aeronca Champion single-engine propeller craft that seats three, was used to tow the kinds of advertising banners seen along beaches in New Jersey and elsewhere, Chief Lynch said. Officials said they did not know what the banner said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters said the airport, which is owned by Lakewood Township, serves small aircraft and does not have a control tower to guide takeoffs and landings, so there were no recordings of last-minute radio calls from the plane. Without a tower, the pilot would have been taking off or landing under his own authority, using visual sighting and general radio broadcasts to inform any other aircraft in the area of his intent, Mr. Peters said.</p>
        <p>The airport is about six miles west of the shore, and a company known as O'Brien Aviation runs a banner towing operation from there. O'Brien's telephone number is the same as the main number for the airport; no one answered the telephone yesterday.</p>
        <p>The plane is registered to Aimada Corporation of Wilmington, Del., said Mr. Peters, the F.A.A. spokesman. Another spokesman for the agency, Roland Herwig, said Aimada had no outstanding violations or any record of crashes or other significant incidents. Mr. Herwig said he could not immediately provide information about the pilot.</p>
        <p>Chief Lynch said that yesterday's accident was the first fatal plane crash that he could remember in his 31 years with the department.</p>
