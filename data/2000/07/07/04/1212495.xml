        <p>Murray Chass Sports of The Times column discusses obscure major league record for driving in runs in 17 consecutive games held by Chicago Cubs first basemen Ray Grimes since 1922; as New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza approaches record, Chass compares importance of it to New York Yankee Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak; holds that RBI streak is as important and clearly more difficult to achieve, but has been obscured because Grimes was not well-known player; photo (M)</p>

        <p>AT first glance, the streak seems to be one of those arcane achievements that only a statistics freak could know or care about. How significant could it be that Mike Piazza was approaching the major league record for driving in runs in consecutive games when the record-holder wasn't Hack Wilson or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth or anyone else of that stature?</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the importance of the streak record is judged by who holds it rather than by what it represents,'' said Steve Hirdt, an executive with Elias Sports Bureau, keeper of Major League Baseball statistics and records. ''I think there would be general unanimity in baseball that driving in runs is at least as important as getting a hit. Yet there are 5-year-olds who would know chapter and verse of Joe DiMaggio's hitting-streak record, while people who make their living playing or covering baseball try to belittle this record simply because the guy who holds it is someone whom they have never heard of.''</p>

        <p>AT first glance, the streak seems to be one of those arcane achievements that only a statistics freak could know or care about. How significant could it be that Mike Piazza was approaching the major league record for driving in runs in consecutive games when the record-holder wasn't Hack Wilson or Lou Gehrig or Babe Ruth or anyone else of that stature?</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the importance of the streak record is judged by who holds it rather than by what it represents,'' said Steve Hirdt, an executive with Elias Sports Bureau, keeper of Major League Baseball statistics and records. ''I think there would be general unanimity in baseball that driving in runs is at least as important as getting a hit. Yet there are 5-year-olds who would know chapter and verse of Joe DiMaggio's hitting-streak record, while people who make their living playing or covering baseball try to belittle this record simply because the guy who holds it is someone whom they have never heard of.''</p>
        <p>Ray Grimes was not Joe DiMaggio, or Lou Gehrig, or Babe Ruth, for that matter. In 1922, Grimes, a first baseman with the Cubs, drove in runs in 17 consecutive games. Chances are no one thought much about it at the time, but nobody had produced such a streak before Grimes did it and no one has done it since.</p>
        <p>Grimes was an unexceptional player. He had a relatively short career, playing 432 games in five seasons after getting into one game in 1920. The season in which he established the record was a career year for him, because he produced 99 of his career 263 runs batted in. But Grimes's record stands 78 years later. DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak is only 59 years old.</p>
        <p>When Wilson knocked in what remains a major league-record 191 runs in 1930, he did not threaten Grimes's record. Elias research found that the longest stretch in which he drove in at least one run was 11 games. The next season Gehrig drove in what continues to be the American League record, 184 runs. His best streak: 10 games. In 1937, Hank Greenberg drove in 183 runs. He knocked in runs in 11 successive games at one stretch.</p>
        <p>More recently, Sammy Sosa drove in 299 runs for the Cubs the previous two seasons, and each season his longest consecutive-game R.B.I. streak was 5. Five games (twice) was the limit, too, for Manny Ramirez last year when he knocked in 165 runs for Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Surpassing Ramirez, Mike Sweeney of Kansas City made it to 13 games in succession a year ago today, tying the A.L. record set by Taffy Wright of the Chicago White Sox in 1941.</p>
        <p>Piazza reached 13 last Friday when he beat Atlanta with a dramatic three-run home run in the eighth inning. A two-run home run in the third inning the next day extended the streak to 14, and he reached 15 Sunday by lashing a home run in the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>That's where the streak ended as the Marlins shut out the Mets, 2-0, last night in Florida. Piazza batted in the first and third innings with runners at first and second but hit a fly ball to right field each time. In the eighth, he came close to hitting a home run, but the ball landed at the base of the left-field fence for a double.</p>
        <p>DiMaggio's hitting streak is often cited as the record least likely to be broken. But why has it received so much attention over the years while Grimes and his record have been completely ignored? Is Steve Hirdt right, that the identity of the player determines the perceived importance of the record?</p>
        <p>A reasonable argument can be made that maintaining an R.B.I. streak is harder than running off a hitting streak. A batter needs no help in building a hitting streak. A single here, a double there, and a streak continues. To build an R.B.I. streak, a player needs teammates to get on base so he can drive them in. He can do it himself occasionally with a home run, but no one has ever hit home runs in 17 consecutive games.</p>
        <p>Many of Piazza's R.B.I. in the 15 games were critical to the outcome. He won the Friday  game against Atlanta, he gave the Mets the lead in six other games, and he knocked in the tying run in three games. The home run Piazza hit Sunday was his eighth in his R.B.I. streak and raised his R.B.I. total in that span to 28.</p>
        <p>The streak has catapulted him to the front of the race for the National League Most Valuable Player award. Although one view might have it that Piazza has been the league's M.V.P. the first half of the season, some more cautious people might want to slip in the hedge word ''perhaps,'' leaving open the possibility that someone else has been the M.V.P. It says here without equivocation that if there were a half-season award, Piazza could step right up and collect it.</p>
