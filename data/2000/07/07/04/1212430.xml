        <p>The Microsoft Corporation added more firepower to the defense team in its antitrust case yesterday by hiring Carter G. Phillips, one of the nation's leading appellate lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips, 47, a partner in the Washington office of Sidley &amp; Austin, is one of the elite group of lawyers who regularly argue cases before the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In the recent term, Mr. Phillips was on the winning side in three cases before the court. In one, he argued on behalf of a health maintenance organization in a case in which the court ruled that the financial incentives placed on doctors to hold down costs do not make H.M.O.'s liable for violating a duty to put patients first. He was a member of the winning legal teams in two other cases: the court's reaffirmation of the Miranda rule and its decision to strike down a New Jersey hate crime law as unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips's first assignment for Microsoft will be to work on a Supreme Court brief, due on July 26, in which the company will argue that the court should allow a federal appeals court to review the antitrust case first. The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft are seeking to have the Supreme Court take the case directly to speed up the appeals stage of the case.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is appealing the ruling of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in a Federal District Court that the company is a monopolist that repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws. Judge Jackson ordered that Microsoft be split in two and that it make a series of changes in its business practices. But soon after, he stayed all of the sanctions until the completion of the appeals process, which could take a year or two.</p>
        <p>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, which presented Microsoft's defense in its setback before the district court, will remain the software maker's lead counsel. ''But we're moving to the next phase of this case, and Sullivan &amp; Cromwell will benefit from the experience of Carter Phillips and Sidley &amp; Austin,'' said James Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft.</p>
        <p>After suffering a courtroom defeat in a major case, it is not unusual for a defendant to bring in additional expertise for the appeals, according to legal experts. Mr. Phillips will work on Microsoft's appeal whether the Supreme Court takes the case directly or not, Mr. Cullinan said.</p>
        <p>Before joining Sidley &amp; Austin, Mr. Phillips was a law clerk to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and he served as assistant solicitor general in the Reagan administration.</p>
