        <p>There has been a significant change in Bernie Williams's life since he became the highest-paid player in Yankees history, he thinks: how others are observing him.</p>
        <p>He senses they are watching to see if the $87.5 million contract he signed 19 months ago will change him. He believes that whatever he does will be viewed through the prism of his salary. If his performance suffers, or if he says or does something disagreeable, all of it will somehow be tied to his wealth.</p>
        <p>''It's more that people around you who, more than not, change their attitude toward you,'' he said in an interview in May. ''They're looking for me to act like I'm royalty. And it seems like everything you do and everything you say, around town and everywhere you live, wherever you go, goes off like gunpowder. So it really makes you aware of the things that you do, and the repercussions.''</p>
        <p>Nothing has changed about Williams's approach to the game. He continues to work diligently on his swing, he runs out every ground ball, and every year he seems to get better. Williams won a batting title in 1998, and in 1999 he became the first Yankee since Lou Gehrig to collect at least 200 hits and 100 walks in the same season.</p>
        <p>But his production this year is staggering, of historic proportions. At 31 years old, Williams has 76 runs batted in through the Yankees' first 76 games, and he is in position to destroy the major league single-season R.B.I. record for switch-hitters: 130, set by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and matched by San Diego's Ken Caminiti in 1996. Williams is on a pace to drive in 162 runs, which would be the most by a Yankee since Joe DiMaggio drove in 167 runs in 1937.</p>
        <p>Williams, who is expected to be one of the Yankees' representatives in next week's All-Star Game, is hitting .329 over all, and .351 with runners in scoring position -- .381 when there are runners in scoring position with two outs.</p>
        <p>He has seven hits in nine at-bats with the bases loaded for a .778 average. He is hitting .375 after the sixth inning. During the recently completed road trip, he carried the Yankees' offense, batting .481 with 15 R.B.I. in 13 games. He scored at least one run in each of the last 13 games, something that no player has accomplished in four years.</p>
        <p>''What he's done is pretty amazing,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>Catcher Jorge Posada said: ''He's just been unbelievably hot the whole year. He hits the ball so hard.''</p>
        <p>The other Yankees have not seen a change in Williams's personality. The center fielder has been as amiable as always: unfailingly friendly and, at the same time, distant, introverted. He is more likely to watch television in the players' lounge or practice on his guitar. The only outward appearance of increased wealth, Posada said, might be that Williams drives a Mercedes now; on the other hand, Williams could have bought a Mercedes before he got his seven-year contract.</p>
        <p>He feels a sense of responsibility to play hard -- the same responsibility, he said, he has always felt.</p>
        <p>''The game is no different,'' Williams said, ''playing and preparing for it. I've been doing it so long, it doesn't change because of the contract. The joy and the sorrow of playing through the year is a whole world within itself. What's going to happen in a year is going to happen no matter what, no matter how much money you're making. I think it really helps to keep myself in check, making sure I'm the same player and I'm the same person, because it doesn't really have to change.''</p>
        <p>Each year, the challenges are the same, refining his left-handed and his right-handed swings. He is naturally right-handed, naturally more comfortable from that side of the plate, more powerful. He has had to learn how to hit left-handed, the adjustments precise.</p>
        <p>In the first weeks of the 1998 and the 1999 seasons, opposing pitchers would blow high fastballs past Williams when he batted left-handed. He worked on his left-handed swing enough that by late May, he would either hit the high fastballs or recognize that they were out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>It is part of the reason Williams has been known as a notoriously slow starter: his left-handed swing wasn't quite as far along as his right-handed swing.</p>
        <p>Williams did not take much batting practice before spring training. He and his family spent their first winter in their Westchester County home -- bought after Williams signed his long-term deal -- and he mostly worked out indoors and avoided the cold.</p>
        <p>But early in spring training, Williams was hitting high fastballs with his left-handed swing.</p>
        <p>''He's a better hitter left-handed now,'' said Posada, who is also a switch-hitter. ''He's got more power right-handed, but he's a better hitter left-handed.''</p>
        <p>Shane Spencer said: ''He hits the ball hard all the time, and I'll sit there and wonder how he does it. It's obvious; he's patient and he's not afraid to fall behind in the count. He'll look for a particular pitch, and if he gets it, he'll get the good part of the bat on it.''</p>
        <p>Williams is batting .333 as a left-handed hitter, .313 as a right-handed hitter.</p>
        <p>His on-base percentage from both sides of the plate is identical: .398. He feels others are watching him, to see if he has changed since he got that big contract.</p>
        <p>And he has changed. He has gotten better.</p>
