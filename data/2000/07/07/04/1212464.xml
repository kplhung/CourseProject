        <p>A British wireless telephone venture backed by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa and Telesystem International Wireless of Canada is in talks to sell about a third of the company to NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, and Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator, for as much as $2 billion, executives close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>The venture, TIW UMTS, owns one of the five highly coveted so-called third-generation wireless licenses in Britain, allowing it to offer consumers high-speed Internet access over mobile telephones and other portable devices. The venture recently won the license for $6.4 billion in a fierce bidding war that raised $35.5 billion for the British government, which auctioned off the licenses.</p>

        <p>A British wireless telephone venture backed by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa and Telesystem International Wireless of Canada is in talks to sell about a third of the company to NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, and Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator, for as much as $2 billion, executives close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>The venture, TIW UMTS, owns one of the five highly coveted so-called third-generation wireless licenses in Britain, allowing it to offer consumers high-speed Internet access over mobile telephones and other portable devices. The venture recently won the license for $6.4 billion in a fierce bidding war that raised $35.5 billion for the British government, which auctioned off the licenses.</p>
        <p>If the sale proceeds, it would give NTT DoCoMo and Royal KPN a foothold in the highly competitive British mobile market. NTT DoCoMo bought a 15 percent stake in Royal KPN's mobile unit, KPN Mobile, for about $4.5 billion a month and a half ago, hoping to create an alliance that would, in part, allow it to pool its resources to aggressively buy third-generation mobile telephone licenses across Europe. The two companies were expected to bid for Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest mobile telephone operator, but were outmaneuvered by France Telecom, which bought Orange for $37.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Executives close to the talks said NTT DoCoMo would acquire about 20 percent of the venture and that Royal KPN would acquire about 15 percent. Hutchison Whampoa would retain a controlling stake.</p>
        <p>The executives cautioned that the negotiations could still break down.</p>
        <p>NTT DoCoMo is aggressively seeking to expand in Europe, which is considered to have the greatest potential for growth in the global mobile market over the next several years. NTT DoCoMo is especially eager to enter the European market because it wants to introduce the market here to its widely popular i-mode technology, which allows customers to gain access to the Internet over their mobile telephones.</p>
