        <p>MONGOLIA: FORMER COMMUNISTS WIN  The country's former Communist rulers won a landslide victory in elections on Sunday and vowed to push ahead with economic reforms while doing more to combat the social costs of the painful 10-year transition from Soviet satellite to a free market. Unofficial results showed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party won 72 out of the 76 open parliamentary seats. The party had ruled Mongolia from the 1920's until 1996, when it was ousted by a democratic coalition.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: WHITE FARMERS' BID  Zimbabwe's white farmers union said more than 200 white-owned farms would be offered for immediate sale to President Robert Mugabe's government for black resettlement.

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: DISPUTE ON CAUSE OF AIDS SWIRLS  President Thabo Mbeki's administration fired back at 5,000 scientists who signed a letter affirming H.I.V. as the cause of AIDS, saying their declaration was a ''waste of time'' and a distraction days before the International AIDS Conference opens in the South African city of Durban. Mr. Mbeki, whose country has more H.I.V.-positive people than any other, has angered many AIDS researchers and activists by his position.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: MILITARY EXEMPTION BILL  After long debate, Parliament passed a preliminary bill that would legalize a practice of granting draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox seminary students. The bill, sponsored by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, would change the present system, which keeps some religious men in school and out of the workforce well into middle age to keep their exemptions. It would allow religious students who left school to serve four months in a special unit in place of three years of mandatory service.</p>

        <p>FIJI: CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT  Defying the gunmen holding the deposed government hostage, the military leader appointed a temporary civilian government but said he would retain power until the captives are freed. Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who took power 10 days after rebels stormed Parliament on May 19 and seized top officials, appointed the new government without consulting the gunmen, who demanded a role.</p>
