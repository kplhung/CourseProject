        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Rocker was in town for the first time after expressing negative stereotypes about New Yorkers Sports pages, July 3. Officials feared that there would be violence. But you can count on New Yorkers to offer the right response. Shea Stadium was filled with placards and chants to tell Rocker, and others like him, how wrong he is.</p>
        <p>The weekend ended with the arrest of Gregory Sweeney for throwing back a ball that Rocker tossed into the stands. At Wrigley Field, fans throw the opposing team's home run ball back as an expression of disdain. Sweeney's action was understood as a statement of rejection of Rocker and his views. It did not create a ''substantial risk of serious physical injury.''</p>
        <p>Arresting Sweeney was an ''error,'' and the district attorney should ''toss'' the criminal charges.</p>

        <p>The writers are, respectively, executive director and legislative director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
