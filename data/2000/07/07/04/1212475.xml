        <p>Editorial says Congress is threatening to reclaim part of supplemental grants it promised to states in exchange for their relinquishing their 60-year-old entitlement to additional federal money when their welfare rolls rise; says at time when federal treasury is flush with cash, Congress need not deprive states with high rates of child poverty of money they were promised</p>

        <p>Congress made a welfare deal with the states in 1996 that it now threatens to tarnish. Under the deal, the states relinquished their 60-year-old entitlement to additional federal money when their welfare rolls rise. In exchange, every state received a big fixed annual grant to cover its welfare costs. Congress also gave 17 needy states extra help in the form of supplemental grants. Congress now threatens to reclaim part of these supplemental grants.</p>
        <p>This misguided proposal would punish poor states with high rates of child poverty. It would also send the terrible message that states will be better off if they spend money quickly and foolishly rather than slowly and well.</p>

        <p>This misguided proposal would punish poor states with high rates of child poverty. It would also send the terrible message that states will be better off if they spend money quickly and foolishly rather than slowly and well.</p>
        <p>Congress provided the supplemental grants partly to help states that were paying low benefits  to existing enrollees. The idea was to close some of the huge gap in benefits paid by rich and poor states. But as a soaring economy and stiff welfare reforms drove down welfare rolls by 30 percent in the years following the 1996 law, states found they did not need to spend every last federal dollar. In addition, the families left behind were often the most disadvantaged and hardest to help. Some states, needing time to figure out how to reach them, held on to their money until they could develop the right strategy.</p>
        <p>The administration proposed many months ago to raise revenue for budget purposes by reclaiming some of the unspent supplemental grants -- an idea embraced by the House and now under consideration by the Senate. But according to the Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, the supplemental grants are essential in helping poorer states achieve parity in federal grants. In the beginning, these poorer states spent  a smaller portion of their federal allotment than  the wealthier states, creating the impression that they did not need the extra money. But their  hesitancy was temporary. Now, according to the center, the states receiving supplemental grants are using more of their federal dollars than other states.</p>
        <p>Money is not the sole answer to poverty. But a recent evaluation of an ambitious program in Minnesota shows that it can produce startling results. The Minnesota welfare program combined generous work incentives with child-care assistance and support for enrollees after they find work. The result was a decline in the number of poor people living solely on welfare and a rise in employment and marriage rates among enrollees. At a time when the federal treasury is flush with cash, Congress need not deprive states with high rates of child poverty of the money they were promised. It is also money they desperately need to help the families left behind by prosperity and facing federally imposed time limits on cash assistance.</p>
