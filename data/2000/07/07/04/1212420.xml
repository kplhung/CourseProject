        <p>For Richard Li, the 30-something tycoon whose deal-making has riveted Hong Kong, Act I ended today.</p>
        <p>Minority shareholders of Cable and Wireless HKT voted overwhelmingly to be acquired by Mr. Li's Internet company, Pacific Century Cyberworks. The deal needs to be ratified by a judge on July 25, but analysts say today's vote guarantees that Mr. Li, 33, will soon own Hong Kong's flagship telephone company.</p>
        <p>Now comes Act II.</p>
        <p>Having won the largest takeover battle in Asian corporate history, Mr. Li must demonstrate that he can run an empire as effectively as he acquired it. On Friday, at an uncharacteristically modest news conference in London, Pacific Century introduced its new television and online service. Known as Network of the World, it is the centerpiece of Mr. Li's effort to combine broadcasting with the Internet.</p>
        <p>It is also the first product from Pacific Century, which has become one of the most celebrated Internet companies in Asia largely on the reputation of its brash founder. Analysts say they will now evaluate Mr. Li's company on the performance of the new service, which will be rolled out the next 18 months to a potential audience of 136 million households in Asia. It will later expand elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''He has to succeed at rolling out the broadband service, and the economics of that haven't been illustrated yet,'' said Greg Feldberg, a communications analyst at Indosuez W. I. Carr Securities here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldberg recently lowered his rating on Pacific Century to a hold from a buy because he believes the company's assets -- even after the acquisition of Cable and Wireless HKT -- do not justify its market value of $20.8 billion.</p>
        <p>Analysts are struggling to assess Network of the World because its ambitions are so great and its starting point is so modest. Pacific Century, which owns no programming and has only a handful of licenses for sporting events like Indian cricket, plans to develop a service that, it declares, will be a ''revolutionary new medium for the new generation of consumers in the digital age.''</p>
        <p>At the moment, however, Network of the World, or NOW, consists of four hours of original programming a day on a single television channel, beamed by satellite to Asia and the Middle East. The companion Web site (www.now.com) has five portals that contain information that builds on the video programming.</p>
        <p>For example, one program features computer-game players squaring off against each other as a host offers play-by-play commentary. Viewers can apply to be contestants by going to a portal, where they will be interviewed by one of the show's ''virtual'' producers. If they prefer to sit on the sidelines, they can create an electronic persona to be inserted in an audience of spectators.</p>
        <p>The network's top producer, who works in London, acknowledges that such programming ideas may seem odd. But he is confident that young viewers will respond in droves.</p>
        <p>''Young people watch TV and surf the Internet at the same time,'' said the executive creative director, Michael Johnson. ''This is a very comfortable space for the computer literate, and it is completely incomprehensible to older viewers.''</p>
        <p>As the network's shaky debut illustrates, however, even traditional television programming is challenging. NOW had hoped to roll out the service last weekend with simultaneous TV and Internet coverage of the Wimbledon tennis championships. But Mr. Johnson said the network canceled the plan at the last minute because it feared problems with the production quality.</p>
        <p>''We'll be there next year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century plans to invest $1.5 billion in Network of the World over the next five years. Some of that will go to opening studios in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Bombay. The rest will go to securing distribution. Mr. Li plans to beam Network of the World to cable operators in China, India and other Asian countries. They would then offer it to their subscribers.</p>
        <p>In building an interactive service, Pacific Century is trying to succeed where other, much larger companies, have failed. Time Warner shut down its cable service in Orlando, Fla., in 1997, after spending millions of dollars and signing up fewer than 10,000 customers. Several regional Bell companies teamed up to start interactive media companies -- only to abandon them a few years later.</p>
        <p>Some analysts contend that NOW will fall to the same weaknesses: inadequate technology and programming that does not beguile viewers. The service's Web site, for example, currently cannot be accessed by an Apple computer or with a Netscape browser.</p>
        <p>''What people want are reliable, high-capacity networks for accessing existing content,'' said Joseph Sweeney, the research director of the Hong Kong office of the Gartner Group, a research firm. ''The NOW network is probably ahead of its time. It's very hard to see how it is going to make money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, a longtime television producer who helped start the Star TV cable network for Mr. Li, rejects these comparisons.</p>
        <p>''The Time Warner TV project really focused on technology,'' he said, ''and the attempt to push movies down phone lines was done by phone companies, which are not famous for knowing audiences.''</p>
