        <p>The leaders of the two national teachers unions today harshly criticized the movement to raise academic standards in public schools for misplaced priorities, each saying at their union conventions that politicians and educators should focus more on developing challenging curriculum and less on testing students.</p>
        <p>Opening the American Federation of Teachers biennial convention here this morning, Sandra Feldman, the president, said her members were the only professionals expected to invent ''their most basic tools'' while practicing their craft and called for a national consortium to develop curriculums on all subjects.</p>
        <p>Nearly 800 miles away in Chicago, Robert Chase, the president of the National Education Association, told some 10,000 convention delegates that enactment of standards had been ''absurd'' and ''perverse'' in some cases and urged ''a massive infusion of common sense -- common sense based on real classroom experience.''</p>
        <p>The American Federation of Teachers has more than 1 million members, the National Education Association some 2.5 million.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Chase and Ms. Feldman said they supported the drive to create higher standards for all students that has swept statehouses and schoolhouses in the last decade. But, they added, they had begun to worry about a backlash against the high-stakes standardized tests intended to monitor progress of the effort.</p>
        <p>''State standards do not curricula make,'' Ms. Feldman told some 4,000 school employees gathered at the gleaming Pennsylvania Convention Center here. ''No test, no matter how good -- and all too many of them are not -- can possibly capture the sum of education, let alone be a substitute for real education.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that the federal government is prohibited by law from writing curriculum, Ms. Feldman instead proposed that the Department of Education invite states into a consortium that would solicit plans to develop and evaluate curriculum and educational software.</p>
        <p>A few hours after Ms. Feldman spoke, Richard W. Riley, the secretary of education, told a group at the convention that he would play host to a national forum intended to address the alignment of curriculum with the new standards and tests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley also expressed support for Ms. Feldman's proposal, made public today, to create a ''transitional'' year of high school to help teenagers who lack basic skills in reading and mathematics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feldman said states and local districts had abandoned curriculum development, handing teachers thick sets of ''frameworks,'' which offer guidelines of what children should know, but no map of how to get there. She also said there should be more uniformity of what was taught nationally.</p>
        <p>''Arithmetic in the third grade in Georgia, kids should be taught at the same level as third-grade arithmetic in California or New York,'' she told reporters after her speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chase, too, complained that teachers were ''being required to teach an entirely new curriculum without textbooks or other resources -- or without training,'' according to a text of his speech.</p>
        <p>He quoted a teacher who wrote to him, saying ''I have never been so overwhelmed in my 32 years of teaching,'' and said ''testing mania'' was overtaking schools ''like some education-eating bacteria.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chase also criticized some of the standards themselves, like California's requirement that fifth graders memorize the elements of the periodic table, and Virginia's expectation in its guidelines that third graders ought to be able to ''describe the ancient civilizations of Greece and Rome in terms of geographic features, government, agriculture, music, art, religion, sports and roles of men, women and children.''</p>
        <p>During a discussion of the standards movement among American Federation of Teachers delegates here, several teachers described how these problems played out locally.</p>
        <p>''Fourth-grade teachers want transfers -- they don't want to teach fourth grade anymore,'' said Jeffrey Rozran, president of the union's local in Syosset, N.Y. ''For those of you who don't know, fourth grade is the testing year.''</p>
        <p>Steve Spence, a geometry teacher in Volusia County, Fla., proudly said that no school in his district received failing grades under the state's new accountability system, then admitted. ''We all taught to the test,'' Mr. Spence said. ''I'm kind of embarrassed to say that.''</p>
        <p>Many teachers called for increased professional development to support the new standards, and Maryann Graczyk, president of the union in Mississippi, received an ovation when she said teachers needed  more parental support.</p>
        <p>''They vote in the survey they want standards,'' she said. ''Try sending more homework home. Try keeping them after school for remediation. Try getting them to pay as much attention to math, science or all the academic areas as they do to football, basketball or cheerleading.''</p>
        <p>At both conventions, the coming presidential election loomed large, with many delegates wearing political buttons and several speakers urging support for Vice President Al Gore, who is scheduled to address each group later this week. Though Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee, has made public education a focus of his campaign, Ms. Feldman said his real goal was to ''demonize it, starve it, and privatize it.''</p>
        <p>''Our choice is very clear,'' Ms. Feldman. ''The outcome is not. And that is why it is so important to vote and get out the vote.''</p>
        <p>Both unions support Mr. Gore and are expected to play an important role in the election through advertising and organizing.</p>
        <p>Beyond the candidates, Mr. Chase said gun control was a crucial election issue, and promised to push for legislation requiring trigger locks on firearms, mandatory background checks on gun purchases and bans on certain high-powered guns and ammunition clips. The conventions held a joint moment of silence for Barry Grunow, the Florida teacher shot to death by a 13-year-old boy on the last day of school this spring.</p>
        <p>''A child is killed by a gun every two hours in our country,'' Mr. Chase said. ''That's 12 children killed by guns every 24 hours. That's the equivalent of one Columbine a day. That's a public health crisis.''</p>
