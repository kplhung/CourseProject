        <p>Shares of the Informix Corporation fell nearly 37 percent yesterday, hitting a 52-week low, after the company, a software maker, said its second-quarter earnings would be below expectations. The stock closed at $4.6875, down $2.75, in Nasdaq trading. In addition, Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said its acquisition of Ardent Software, which was completed on March 1, would not add to earnings for 2000, as previously expected. Informix said it expected to earn 1 to 3 cents a share for the quarter ended June 30, well below the 12 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
