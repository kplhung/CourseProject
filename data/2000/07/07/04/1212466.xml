        <p>The Yankees' pitching staff crumbled in the past month, and the epicenter of the problems formed in Tampa, Fla., when Ed Yarnall hurt his back and then bombed in his audition for the role of No. 5 starter. Yarnall's struggles sent shock waves throughout the staff.</p>
        <p>Because Yarnall did not win the job, Ramiro Mendoza was shifted from the bullpen to the rotation. He  has battled arm trouble, and the remaining relievers have been used a little more often, for a little longer, than usual -- and all have suffered for it from time to time. But Yarnall figures to join the Yankees' rotation Thursday against Baltimore, and it stands to reason that if Yarnall does well, he could stick around a while.</p>
        <p>If the left-handed Yarnall does well against an Oriole lineup stacked with left-handed hitters, then he could remain in the rotation. Mendoza could rejoin the bullpen after being activated from the disabled list later this month, and that would add  depth in the Yankees' relief.</p>
        <p>Yarnall has pitched well for Class AAA Columbus in the last two weeks after recovering from tendinitis. He started Sunday against Toledo and was removed after only 59 pitches -- probably to keep him fresh in the event he starts against the Orioles Thursday. ''I'm looking forward to it, if it happens,'' Yarnall said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''If I do get the chance, go up there and throw a good game, then get some more opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Trey Hillman, the Columbus manager, is convinced that Yarnall's early season troubles stemmed from a lower-back injury he sustained early in spring training. His upper back began to bother him after spring training, and then his shoulder, and ''it all just screwed him up mechanically,'' Hillman said. ''He couldn't pull through on the slider, his changeup wasn't as good, his command wasn't there. He's entirely different now.''</p>
        <p>Yarnall noticed that when he resumed throwing, his fastball had more life to it -- very important to the left-hander, who does not overpower hitters but must have enough velocity to jam right-handed batters with his cut fastball, the way Andy Pettitte does.</p>
        <p>''Everything is good now, the back doesn't bother me and the shoulder feels good,'' Yarnall said. ''When I came back and started throwing, I was back to normal.''</p>
        <p>Assuming that David Cone, Pettitte and Yarnall start the three games against Baltimore this week, then Orlando Hernandez would be in line to pitch Friday against the Mets, in Shea Stadium, and Roger Clemens presumably would throw one of the two games of the day-night doubleheader Saturday.</p>
        <p>Based on Clemens's statistics since joining the Yankees, it would make more sense for him to pitch the night game, at Yankee Stadium: While with the Yankees, Clemens is 13-8 with a 3.82 earned run average in home games, and 6-8 with a 5.62 E.R.A. on the road. Clemens has lost both of his regular-season starts in Shea, allowing 11 earned runs in 12 innings.</p>
        <p>Unless the Yankees dig deep into their bullpen over the next four days, Jason Grimsley, or perhaps the right-hander Ben Ford, could start in one of Saturday's games against the Mets. The Mets' lineup is predominantly right-handed hitting and Grimsley does much better against lefties, but on the other hand, Torre may be reluctant to use a rookie like Ford in such a high-pressure situation.</p>
        <p>Dwight Gooden is also a possibility for the Saturday doubleheader. Recently signed to a minor league contract, Gooden pitched well in a rookie league game yesterday, throwing five shutout innings and striking out six. ''I was very pleased,'' Gooden told The Associated Press. ''I've been working on my mechanics and I'm thinking positive again about my mechanics. Once you start feeling good about your mechanics, everything else will take care of itself.''</p>
        <p>But the possible promotion of Gooden would promise great debate in the Yankees' organization, because once called up, Gooden could not be returned to the minors without his permission. The Yankees would have to have a defined role for Gooden, and they may be more inclined to try Yarnall in the rotation. It figures that they would not promote Gooden until they were absolutely sure he will be part of their plans.</p>
        <p>Cone is in line to pitch Sunday's series finale, in what would be his first start in Shea Stadium since the Mets traded him during the 1992 season.</p>
