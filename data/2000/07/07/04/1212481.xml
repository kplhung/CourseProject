        <p>HOW TO BURN $73 MILLION  With George W. Bush breaking all fund-raising records, a lot of people in the political consulting and media business are reaping a windfall. A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics shows exactly how Mr. Bush spent the $73 million raised for his primary bid. The big-ticket item was $21.7 million in campaign advertising, mostly for television. Air charters came in second at $4.7 million, and other forms of travel expenses -- buses, cars, parking and hotels -- added an additional $1.4 million. Then came direct-mail expenses at $4.2 million, with $4.1 million on postage, printing and delivery of those direct-mail pieces, plus $2.9 million for payroll, $135,741 for consultants and -- of course -- $672,210 for fund-raising. ''Bush's spending seems more fitting for a small corporation than a campaign for president,'' said Holly Bailey, who wrote the study. Put another way, since Mr. Bush announced his presidential candidacy in March 1999, he has rolled up a money ''burn rate'' of $1.3 million a week, or $180,000 a day.</p>

        <p>LONG RUNNING MATE LIST  Gov. George W. Bush met with the head of his vicepresidential search team yesterday and said he still had a long and varied list of potential running mates to consider. At his ranch north of Waco, Tex., the Texas governor met with former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and said he had not even decided whether to announce his choice before or at the Republican National Convention, which begins in four weeks in Philadelphia. Mr. Bush again said that he was not ruling out supporters of abortion rights and that women were being considered. ''The main test will be, Can the person be president and will the person be loyal to this administration and will the person bring added value to the Bush administration,'' he said.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BIG LEAD MISLEADING?  Although most national polls have shown Gov. George W. Bush with a healthy lead over Vice President Al Gore, a new survey by Newsweek magazine has found them in a dead heat. In a two-way race, Mr. Gore has the support of 46 percent of voters, with Mr. Bush at 45 percent, the survey found. A four-way race also produced a deadlock with Mr. Bush at 41 percent, Mr. Gore at 40 percent, Ralph Nader at 6 percent and Patrick J. Buchanan at 2 percent. The survey polled 752 people in late June and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>WEB VOTING FOR PRIMARY  The Reform Party's presidential primary will feature not only traditional paper ballots but also voting via the Internet, yet another sign that balloting on the Web, once only a topic of discussion, is slowly becoming a reality. In the March primary in Arizona, more than 45 percent of the 85,970 votes cast were sent via computers from homes, schools and Internet connections at polling places. For the Reform primary, party members will be mailed a ballot packet with a traditional ballot and instructions for online voting, to be conducted at www.eballot.net. The packet gives voters a personal identity number and a guide to locate the ballot on the Web. Electronic votes can be submitted for a limited time before the party's Aug. 9 convention. ''A mixed-media election provides our nationwide constituency with greater choice,'' said Michael Farris, chairman of the party's election committee.</p>
