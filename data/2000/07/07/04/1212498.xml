        <p>To Police Commissioner Howard Safir, the release of details yesterday of the department's investigation of its handling of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade and the Central Park sex attacks was a forthright and scalding self-analysis, a case of the police pursuing their own faults with vigor and speed.</p>
        <p>To some of the victims, it was something less.</p>
        <p>Susan M. Karten, a lawyer for Anne Peyton Bryant, one of 59 women who have reported being attacked on June 11, said the police action to date was insufficient on its face.</p>
        <p>A dozen police officers or emergency dispatchers face administrative charges or reprimands for their actions that day, when groups of young men attacked scores of women along the southern edge of Central Park after the parade had ended and officers were heading home. The officers are accused of a variety of offenses: failing to properly classify 911 calls, inadequately supervising their subordinates, dismissing officers too early in the day, and in two cases, not helping victims when they reported the crimes.</p>
        <p>Four commanders have been censured, Mr. Safir said yesterday, while four officers face administrative charges that could lead to their dismissal. A fifth police officer and three 911 operators could lose vacation time.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Safir said investigators had not completed their work, Ms. Karten said the first results spoke for themselves: the department had not rooted out enough of the offending police officers, she said, and was not exposing most to serious punishment. ''This, to me, shows that the police commissioner did the very least to save face in a horrible situation,'' she said, adding that her client alone had reported being attacked to eight police officers and received no help.</p>
        <p>Ms. Karten said she was particularly concerned about the decision to bring a moderate form of punishment against Officer Scott Hyndman, who is accused of not taking a police report from Ms. Bryant at the 17th Precinct station house on East 51st Street. Ms. Karten called his worst possible penalty -- the loss of 10 vacation days -- ''a slap on the wrist for someone who had absolutely no compassion and did not follow police procedures.''</p>
        <p>Sanford A. Rubenstein, a lawyer representing two victims -- Ashanna Cover, a sophomore at a New Jersey technical college, and Josina Lawrence, a senior at Howard University -- also said the report was disappointing. One of the accused officers, Michael Bonefant, had been identified by Ms. Cover and Ms. Lawrence as an officer who did not help them after they reported being attacked, a police official said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rubenstein said the department had not done enough to identify other officers who did not assist the victims, including another one who turned away his clients. Still, he said, the report did have some value. ''It certainly substantiates the comments made, not only by my clients but by others as well, about the failure of police officers to take action,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not everyone was critical yesterday. One woman, the mother of a Long Island teenager who was assaulted in the park near Central Park South and Avenue of the Americas said she thought investigators would continue to make headway.</p>
        <p>She said Internal Affairs investigators visited her daughter three times, showing her photographs of police officers who were posted in the area at the time of the attacks. Her daughter, a high school junior, identified one officer who refused to help her, picking him from his peers by his distinctive glasses.</p>
        <p>The officer was not among those charged, but the victim's mother said she remained patient and hoped he soon would be. ''Internal Affairs seems to be being very thorough,'' she said. ''I can't say anything bad about them. They seem to be covering all the bases.''</p>
