        <p>''Childhood is the first, inescapable political situation each of us has to negotiate,'' says the writer June Jordan. ''You are powerless. You are on the wrong side in every respect. Besides that, there's the size thing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan, a poet and essayist who has written on topics like apartheid, rape and her mother's suicide, has now ventured into the territory of childhood with ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood,'' recently published by Basic Civitas Books.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan, 63, was in New York recently as part of a tour to promote the book. She is a professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley, where she also directs the Poetry for the People project, a course for Berkeley undergraduates that includes a program to introduce poetry to local high school students.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Jordan is perhaps most identified with the leftist political battles and feminist foment of the 1960's and 70's, she has endured as an artistic force. Dozens of people, many of them young, had to be turned away at a recent reading she gave at New York University. At that event, Toni  Morrison introduced her in a kind of literary coronation.</p>
        <p>''When I first met June Jordan, my familiarity with the lives of activists-artists led me to wonder what would shrink first: her art or her progressive activism,'' she told the audience. Neither has, Ms. Morrison said. Ms. Jordan is ''as responsive to slaughter in Baghdad as she is to rape in the kitchen, as outraged by state lies as she is made delirious by love,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan's oeuvre includes poetry, plays, novels, essays, children's books and the libretto for John Adams's 1995 opera ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.'' While her work has been criticized at times as politically strident, it has also been praised as frank and mellifluous.</p>
        <p>A brief review by Johanna Berkman for The New York Times faulted her 1998 book, ''Affirmative Acts: Political Essays'' (Anchor/Doubleday), for example, for ''a far-fetched attempt to extract political significance from her oral surgery,'' as well as ''frequent use of the overwrought prose of politically correct cliche.'' But the reviewer concluded, ''Still, her lyric writing is a powerful mix of the inspirational and the dispiriting.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan writes by hand at her dining room table. ''Soldier'' was a sometimes wrenching journey, she said, because many of her memories were painful. It took three months of reviewing notebook jottings about characters and structure before she wrote her first sentence. She decided that the best approach was to write the book with the consciousness of a child, without the filter of adult perceptions and judgments.</p>
        <p>She reports beatings at the hands of her father, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, this way: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: ''Daddy! What did I do?!</p>
        <p>''And now he lays on a belt, slapping the leather and the buckle hard against the blankets or my arm exposed by short-sleeve teddy-bear pajamas. ''And I am trying to cover my face and he tears away the blankets and I can barely recognize this man, my father.''</p>
        <p>There are happier memories, too. She recalls her first date in a torrent of words: ''And then there was Herbie Wilson Jr. ringing the bell. And I went to the gate to open it and he was wearing a tie and a new suit and the old lace-up shoes he always liked to wear and we went to the city and we watched this play about a white girl with her Negro ''Mammy'' looking after her and at one point the girl uses this huge knife to slice at something on her foot and that made the biggest impression on me about ''Member of the Wedding'' except for afterward when Herbie Wilson Jr. took me to the Times Square Crossroads Cafe and we sat at this tiny table with a blue-and-white checkered tablecloth and he ordered strawberry shortcake for both of us and a bottle of beer for himself and a glass of milk for me and I felt pretty sure I must look all right.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan said: ''I feel very proud to try to contribute to the literature on girls. We have a lot about boys. This story of a black child, a poet, a girl, is claiming space for those various groups.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan grew up in Harlem and Brooklyn, reading Shakespeare and Edgar Allan Poe before she turned 5, she says. Her family moved from a Harlem housing project to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area in Brooklyn because it seemed like a better place to raise a family.</p>
        <p>''Soldier'' is a sparely written kaleidoscope of the young June at school and at home, learning about love and books, about being smart and being a girl. She recalls her father's using a pot of boiling water to scald an annoying, howling cat under their window. And she remembers savoring the feeling of escape in climbing an apple tree at Robin Hood Camp in ''the country.''</p>
        <p>The memoir ends with her scoring high on an intelligence test and winning a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls, (now the coed Northfield-Mount Hermon School) in Massachusetts. Her father takes her to Track 22 in Grand Central Terminal and tells his little soldier, ''You gwine make me proud.''</p>
        <p>Her mother, Mildred Maude Jordan, is depicted in ''Soldier'' as a mysteriously troubled woman in retreat from herself and the world. Her mother did not assert herself when her husband beat their only child or insistently referred to his daughter as ''he,'' Ms. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jordan does not call her father abusive. He also forced her to memorize long passages of literature and poetry. The book is dedicated to him, the man who inadvertently paved the way for her entry into her own world of words.</p>
        <p>That is not what her parents intended, she laughed. Doctors, not poets, are what first-generation immigrant families want, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan's parents came from Jamaica. Her father, a postal clerk, was half Chinese, a self-taught ''race man'' who admired Marcus Garvey but made derogatory comments about the darker skin of his wife and his daughter. Her mother was a nurse. The parents often fought over money, manners and their daughter.</p>
        <p>''I love my father,'' Ms. Jordan said. ''And he was crazy. He associated social humiliation with racial identity. He didn't want what happened to him to happen to me, and it would happen if I was black and if I was female.''</p>
        <p>Asked about the beatings, she said: ''Anyone can come up with an adjective, a pejorative. I had committed myself to writing this in the consciousness of a child, which meant making no judgments. I hope in a way this is very good news: I'm O.K. One can reasonably say some pretty dire things about my folks, but I love my father. I'm here to say, I'm here; I'm O.K.''</p>
        <p>Writing from a child's perspective was difficult because it involved shutting out the day-to-day demands of adulthood, said Ms. Jordan, who has a grown son. It was challenging to reconstruct her life in prose rather than poetry, she added.</p>
        <p>''I was winding up, ready to sing,'' she said. ''I was afraid if it was poetry, people wouldn't read it.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing should be a poem,''except that too many people fear poetry, Ms. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>In her ''Poetry for the People'' course (Ms. Jordan calls it a ''movement'') students study the poetry of three different cultures each year and the ways those cultures shape writers. This year they are surveying Arab, African-American and Chicano cultures.</p>
        <p>''It's only in the African-American segment of poetry that you find people talking about freedom, over and over again,'' she said. ''Why is that? Why do you find the incredible emphasis on the fact that you exist, the 'I am.' You can't understand that until you understand the history.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jordan describes herself as a soldier trying to see the world anew and report her sightings.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident that things are changing in a way that is profound and helpful,'' she said. ''Those of us who have mothers and fathers who came over here are the children of unlimited expectations, and those expectations attach themselves to the abstract idea that is the United States.''</p>
        <p>''Otherwise, that would be dishonoring what motivated them -- despite extraordinary contempt and disregard'' for who they are in their adopted land, she said.</p>
