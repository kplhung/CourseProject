        <p>Catching Meteor Flashes</p>
        <p>A mosquito hitting a bug zapper goes out, if not in a blaze of glory, at least in a flash of light.</p>
        <p>Small meteors hitting that giant rock zapper known as the Moon should go out in a flash of light as well, since their speed at impact is on the order of tens of thousands of miles an hour. But no unambiguous evidence of a lunar meteor flash has ever been recorded.</p>
        <p>Now, however, astronomers have reported detecting five impact flashes last Nov. 18, during the annual Leonids meteor storm. The flashes were observed using an eight-inch telescope in Monterrey, Mexico (viewing time had been reserved on other, larger scopes, but bad weather intervened), that was focused on the part of the Moon that was in darkness. A report on the observations was published in Nature.</p>
        <p>The flashes were very brief, less than two-hundredths of a second, and occurred within a 90-minute span when the Moon was closest to the Leonid stream of rocks and dust. The astronomers calculated that the brightest of the impacts was caused by a rock with a mass of 2.5 pounds to 20 pounds.</p>
        <p>In preparatory observations in July 1999, the astronomers recorded what they said was possibly another impact flash. If it was an impact, and not electronic noise in the digital recording device attached to the telescope, it was caused by a 30-pound meteor, the astronomers said.</p>
        <p>Up, Up and Away</p>
        <p>The people of New Mexico know about balloons. After all, it was the crash of an experimental balloon in 1947 (according to the military) that burned the name Roswell into the minds of U.F.O. believers everywhere.</p>
        <p>Given that history, it's hard to imagine what residents might have thought recently when a huge pumpkin-shaped balloon lifted into the skies near Fort Sumner, N.M. The flight, which lasted 30 hours and reached 93,000 feet, was a test of a new type of research balloon designed to carry telescopes and other instruments to over 115,000 feet and stay there for at least three months. The balloons are meant to be a cheaper way to get such instruments to the edge of space.</p>
        <p>When fully developed, the long-duration balloons should be almost as big as a football field, and able to carry payloads of close to two tons (the prototype was only about one-tenth as big). The balloon owes its pumpkin shape to tendons running along the thin polyethylene surface that take most of the load. There were no reports of Cinderella sightings, however.</p>
        <p>Fruit Fly's New Role</p>
        <p>If there were a Research Insect Hall of Fame, the fruit fly would be among the first inductees. Drosophilae, as the flies are more formally known, have been smeared, stained, injected, dissected, mutated and extracted by the gazillions. They even had their genome sequenced before humans (though without quite as much fanfare).</p>
        <p>Now scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Whitehead Institute have come up with a new laboratory role for fruit flies: as a model for studying malaria.</p>
        <p>The parasite, Plasmodium, is normally carried by mosquitoes, which transmit it to people through bites. While in the mosquito, the parasite goes through several stages of its life cycle. But studying exactly how the parasite affects its host is difficult, in part because not all that much is known about mosquitoes' genetic makeup or basic biochemistry.</p>
        <p>That is where the fruit fly comes in. The researchers have figured out a way to grow the parasite in Drosophila. And because so much is known about fruit flies, including their entire DNA sequence, they make a good laboratory model for studying the effects of Plasmodium. Already the researchers have identified elements of the insect's immune system that attack the parasites, helping to explain why some mosquitoes effectively fight off infection.</p>
