        <p>The new jail inmate had intimidating arms, thick as thighs. But he extended one meekly when a nurse, Jean Graves, told him: ''I have to give you a tuberculosis skin test. I also have to draw blood for syphilis, O.K.?''</p>
        <p>As she slid the needle into his skin, the City of Nashville took one more small step in a sweeping national program: a push by health authorities to rid the country of the scourge of syphilis, spirochete bacterium by spirochete, chancre sore by chancre, once and for all.</p>
        <p>Even here, where the syphilis rate is the second highest in the country among major cities, topped only by Indianapolis, the numbers are less than staggering. Only 250 cases of new -- and thus still infectious -- syphilis turned up last year. Nationwide, they dropped below 7,000, down from the most recent peak of 50,000 in 1990.</p>
        <p>But that is the very point, health officials say. Now, when new cases are at an all-time low and so concentrated that about half of them come from just 25 of the country's 3,100 counties, is the time to try to wipe it out altogether. They are prosecuting a multipronged attack that includes heavy reliance on community activism and stepped-up detective work to track down carriers and those at risk, as well as expanded clinical and laboratory services.</p>
        <p>Up close, however, this campaign, which officially started last October, sometimes appears more a slog than a fast strike, a lesson in the painstaking process of fighting sexually transmitted diseases even when, like syphilis, they have a cure as easy as a couple of shots of penicillin.</p>
        <p>At a briefing this week in Atlanta, local health officials reported lessons and patches of progress from the three metropolitan areas where pilot anti-syphilis programs are already under way: Nashville, Raleigh, N.C., and Indianapolis, all places where rates are high. They included word from North Carolina that the state had begun to see a sharp drop in syphilis rates, by 36 percent last year compared with 1998, and a report that nationwide, the striking racial disparity in syphilis rates had diminished as well, from a 43-to-1 ratio of blacks to whites infected in 1997, down to less than a 30-to-1 ratio in 1999.</p>
        <p>The local officials also called for continued federal financing for their program, which is expected to cost $37 million a year through 2005 but has been allocated only about half that to date. In his current budget, President Clinton is requesting an additional $15 million for the anti-syphilis effort in 2001. But the Senate, seeking to funnel more money instead toward chlamydia prevention, is considering providing only half that amount for syphilis.</p>
        <p>''Everything I know about the epidemiology of syphilis tells me this elimination effort is dead in the water if we're not able to sustain the president's budget request,'' warned Dr. Judith N. Wasserheit, who directs the Division of Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Without an elimination program, which health officials say must be full-fledged or it will fail, federal health officials project, syphilis, which tends to rise and fall in 7- to 10-year cycles, could reach 23,000 new cases in 2005. As it is, they said, treatment for syphilis and its consequences cost nearly $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>For all their focus on money, however, they also emphasized that money is not enough: that syphilis elimination takes commitment and energy.</p>
        <p>In Nashville, that means it needs workers like Pam Pitts, who persuades new inmates at the jail to have tests and, if infected, identify their sexual partners; and Tina Lester, who coordinates the anti-syphilis campaign among dozens of community groups and churches in the poor neighborhoods where the disease is most prevalent; and Princesita A. L. Hawkins, who ventures out into those same neighborhoods every day to track down carriers and talk them into getting help.</p>
        <p>It can be a hard and frustrating job, Ms. Hawkins said: ''A lot of your patients, you're going to be more concerned about their health than they are.''</p>
        <p>But it is a job that must be done, health officials say, as they struggle to learn how best to eliminate a disease that is easy to test for and cure but not as easy to prevent.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, we don't have vaccines for the majority of infectious disease now,'' Dr. Wasserheit said. ''So a strategy like this, that allows us to eliminate a disease through a multifaceted approach, is a new thing and a really important concept that goes way beyond syphilis itself.''</p>
        <p>The United States has tried before to eliminate syphilis, but never reached the near-total success of European countries -- in part, experts say, because the efforts failed to reach the poor areas most affected. This new approach, health officials say, emphasizes heavier community involvement than ever, from church sermons to screenings in local libraries, along with more tracking and clinical services. It seeks to bring syphilis cases below 1,000 nationwide, which is not total eradication but low enough to be considered elimination.</p>
        <p>Here in Nashville, that strategy has translated into innovative moments, from anti-syphilis church sermons last Valentine's Day to a graphic ''Syphilis is Scary'' exhibit at a university last Halloween, to talks by Ms. Lester in which her advice to teenagers considering a sexual encounter includes, ''Turn on the light, look at people, don't just trust!''</p>
        <p>(In its early stages, syphilis shows up as painless genital sores, which go away by themselves, and weeks or months later as rashes, which also tend to heal untreated.)</p>
        <p>In Nashville, some things are already becoming clear. One is that focusing syphilis prevention efforts on the city jail is highly effective.</p>
        <p>More than half the cases that the city has picked up in recent months came from the program to screen new inmates and try to get them treatment quickly, before they get bond or move on, officials say. Overall, about 70 percent of people found to have syphilis have a criminal record, said Dr. Jesse Huang, the city's chief epidemiologist. Rates in homeless shelters are also disproportionately high, he said.</p>
        <p>Pam Pitts, the public health worker now stationed full time in the city's main jail, said that perhaps 10 percent or 20 percent of new inmates refuse to be screened, for all her persuasive powers. Women tend to refuse out of belligerence, men because they're scared of the needle, she said. But over all, she is more convinced than ever that she is stationed in the right place.</p>
        <p>''I think without a corrections process you're not going to eliminate syphilis in your community, you're just not,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Another lesson is that word does get around; several public health workers said that recently, they had begun encountering a few people who said they had heard that there was a syphilis problem in Nashville.</p>
        <p>But only a few. More typical was Ricky Carr, 38, a construction worker who had been lured into a public library for a free screening the other day. He had mainly wanted an H.I.V. screening to dispel the rumors that, because he had been looking bad as he recovered from surgery recently, he had AIDS. But he agreed to a syphilis test as well, though he had heard nothing of the epidemic and knew no one who had it.</p>
        <p>''I know I ain't got no syphilis, I think I can pretty much tell that,'' Mr. Carr said. But ''it's free, and I'm off today, and I don't mind looking after me.''</p>
        <p>In most ways, health officials acknowledge, syphilis has not been as worrisome as some other diseases since penicillin came into use, and to this day the bacteria have developed no resistance to antibiotics, in sharp contrast to gonorrhea and other diseases.</p>
        <p>But if left untreated for years, it can damage the brain, heart and other organs; if a pregnant woman is infected and left untreated, it can prove deadly for her baby; and its sores raise significantly the chances of transmission of H.I.V.</p>
        <p>The question remains: If syphilis tends to affect the poorest of the poor, the homeless, the drug users, the prostitutes, people who tend to be alienated enough from government and even medical officials that some resist even efforts to test and cure them, can it really be eliminated as health officials plan?</p>
        <p>Ms. Lester and others in Nashville say it can.</p>
        <p>''I think that it can be done,'' she said. ''It's just that we really need to get to the core of the infection, just keep tracking down those contacts.''</p>
