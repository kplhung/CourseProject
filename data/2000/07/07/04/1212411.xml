        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Mr. Nader's Misguided Crusade'' (editorial, June 30):</p>
        <p>Is Al Gore's candidacy so fragile that it should be insulated from challenges by third-party candidates, as you suggest? If my candidacy as the Green Party's nominee for president subtracts more from Mr. Gore, it is because the Democratic Party under this administration has become little more than a corporate shadow of its former self.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the thesis of your editorial, setting aside posturing, there are very few major differences between the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates and even fewer differences in the sources of funds that overflow their parties' campaign chests. The corporate power structure dominates both parties and determines the limits of their meager initiatives.</p>
        <p>Major problems, like concentration of corporate power, corporate crime and corporate welfare, health care, continued degradation of inner cities and child poverty, linger on election after election without solution, regardless of which party captures the White House. Facile rhetoric becomes a substitute for leadership. The Clinton-Gore record offers no real hope for changing the concentration of power by the few over the needs of the many.</p>
        <p>You suggest that adding new voices to the political debate is cluttering the playing field. Your desire to limit the national political campaign and the ensuing debate to two lookalike parties is most remarkable in its disdain for genuine competition.</p>
        <p>RALPH NADER  Washington, June 30, 2000</p>
