        <p>In its day, which was 1593, it was wildly popular. By the Victorian era, it was considered too scandalous to perform. The work was Shakespeare's bawdy epic poem ''Venus and Adonis,'' in which the love goddess tries without success to seduce the young Adonis.

        <p>Tanglewood Time</p>
        <p>For devotees of summertime music, Friday is a red-letter day. That's when the 2000 Tanglewood season opens in Lenox, Mass., with Seiji Ozawa leading the Boston Symphony Orchestra in a program that ushers in a summerlong centennial tribute to Aaron Copland and features Yo-Yo Ma as soloist in Haydn's Cello Concerto in C. Other highlights include the orchestra's performance of Britten's War Requiem (Aug. 6) and an appearance by Van Cliburn, playing Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 with Mr. Ozawa and the orchestra (Aug. 4).</p>
        <p>Leading a Library</p>
        <p>Effective Sept. 11, Jacqueline Z. Davis is to become the executive director of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Established in 1965 at Lincoln Center, the library combines circulating, reference and rare archival collections. Ms. Davis, whose appointment was announced by Paul LeClerc, the president of the New York Public Library, and William D. Walker, director of its Research Libraries, is executive director of the Lied Center at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, a leading university arts presenter. The Lincoln Center library is undergoing renovation, and its components are to return next spring from temporary locations.</p>
        <p>Briefs</p>
        <p>Among the playwrights are Amiri Baraka, Ed Bullins, Alice Childress, Charles Fuller, Langston Hughes, Ron Milner and Douglas Turner Ward. The event is a five-week festival of one-act plays by 18 eminent black writers. Beginning tomorrow and continuing through Aug. 6 at the Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Art Center at 466 Grand Street on the Lower East Side, ''Great Black One-Act Plays'' is a production of Woodie King Jr.'s National Black Touring Circuit. Six directors and 24 actors will stage plays like Mr. Baraka's ''Skin Trouble'' and Hughes's ''Soul Gone Home.''</p>
