        <p>A 5-year-old Connecticut boy who nearly drowned on Saturday after riding an amusement park water slide remained in critical condition yesterday at a children's hospital in Hartford.</p>
        <p>The boy, Devon M. Alexander, spent 25 minutes underwater after sliding off an inner tube that he had ridden down a 375-foot-long water chute at Lake Compounce, an amusement park in Bristol, Conn.</p>
        <p>Park officials said the boy, who was with his stepfather at the time of the accident, had met the 46-inch height requirement for the ride, called the Lake Plunge, but did not know how to swim.</p>
        <p>A sign near the entrance to the water slide warns: ''Strong swimmers only. Deep water. Strong current.'' The stepfather, Damon Comeaux, told a park attendant that the boy could handle the slide, park officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comeaux could not be reached by telephone.</p>
        <p>Lake Plunge riders sit in an inner tube and race down the enclosed water chute into a 28-acre natural lake. Double tubes are available for parents who want to ride with their children.</p>
        <p>Park officials said that Devon and his stepfather did not want to use the double tube when they got to the ride shortly after 7 p.m. Instead, Mr. Comeaux planned to ride the slide after Devon in a separate tube.</p>
        <p>But as Devon's tube hit the lake, he slid off it and disappeared underwater. When he did not resurface, Mr. Comeaux notified lifeguards.</p>
        <p>At least one lifeguard saw the boy fall and jumped in after him. The ride is monitored by four lifeguards, and within minutes they were joined in the search by at least 18 others.</p>
        <p>The boy was found about 25 minutes later, in water 15 feet deep, about 100 feet from where the tube had landed. He was being treated yesterday at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Richard Bisi, a spokesman for Lake Compounce, said the Lake Plunge would remain closed as investigations continued.</p>
        <p>Local police and the state fire marshals, who license amusement park operators, are investigating the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bisi said that life vests are available throughout the water park but their use is not required.</p>
