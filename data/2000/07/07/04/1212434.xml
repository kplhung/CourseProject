        <p>My fellow Americans.</p>
        <p>We stand here today on the bridge to the 21st century. Some may decry this bridge as unnecessary, and argue that since we have already been in the 21st century for some months now, no new infrastructure is needed.</p>
        <p>To them I say: Consider the feelings of the many Americans who believe that the new century does not really begin until Jan. 1, 2001. We have not heard their voices recently. They cower silently in our midst, fearing that one careless word might trigger a new flood of millennium roundups. But they are out there, and they deserve their bridge.</p>
        <p>Yes, there are dawdlers on the road to the future, milling sullenly like frequent fliers at La Guardia Airport during a monsoon. However, even they must know that we are on the brink of something new, something so unique it has not even been stolen from European TV programming. It is a new era, and to begin it, we will be electing a new president. That campaign has already begun -- indeed, it has been going on for longer than the combined administrations of William Henry Harrison and James Garfield.</p>
        <p>It is hard to believe that this is still the same race as the one that had Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes in it, in which Lamar Alexander once frolicked and Orrin Hatch romped. And where are they now, my friends? Not gone, surely, but only on summer hiatus, like the Sopranos.</p>
        <p>Soon we will bid farewell to Bill Clinton, our companion through so many civic adventures, from the New Covenant to the V-chip. We can be confident that his successor will be a man who listens to the lessons of the past. In fact, both Al Gore and George W. Bush are so soaked in the lore of bygone elections that they might well be called the metaphorical equivalent of history's drowned kittens.</p>
        <p>We all realize that Mr. Bush is the son of one former president. But how many of you know that he is also a direct descendant of another? Yes, some of Mr. Bush's genomes were once worn by Franklin Pierce -- the man known as ''Young Hickory'' to his supporters in New Hampshire and ''The Fainting General'' to his troops in the field. He was also called ''the victor over many a hard-fought bottle,'' but only by political opponents wishing to harp on isolated incidents, all of which I believe occurred before his 40th birthday.</p>
        <p>Our candidates are both the products of great traditions of public service. Mr. Gore is the son of a senator, Mr. Bush is the grandson. America has been blessed with many presidents who spring from such well-hoed political truck gardens. Perhaps this year's winner will find it in him to become another John Quincy Adams or Benjamin Harrison, or even a second, smaller, William Howard Taft.</p>
        <p>There are some among you, I know, who feel that electoral politics are not what they once were. Where, you may ask, are the election rallies of yore, the bonfires, the parades?  Whatever happened to the old-fashioned civic spirit that once inspired our citizens to raise incredibly tall poles or roll extremely large balls from town to town in support of a favorite candidate? When people ask, as they so often do, ''Where are the Grover Clevelands for the new millennium?'' I can only shake my head and say that we get the leaders we deserve.</p>
        <p>Some people go further and claim that there are not even any issues worth fighting for in this flaccid new era. They miss the days when the mere mention of ''free silver'' or ''Remember the Maine'' or ''Save Checkers'' set passions quivering. Today, our blood runs cooler. Still, who among us did not feel a twinge of excitement as we watched the Al Gore Prosperity and Progress Tour? Who did not feel relief at the news that George W. Bush intends to be a Reformer With Results?</p>
        <p>No issues? Speak on, you prophets of doom -- what say you of Mr. Bush's war against the ''tollbooth on the road to the middle class,'' a loathsome structure he intends to destroy with copious tax reductions? Mr. Bush hates that tollbooth, even on the days he refers to it as ''toolboth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore says he would use our excess money to pay down the national debt, and make the nation totally solvent for the first time since 1835, an era when Franklin Pierce was just a pup and America was preparing to celebrate the Panic of 1837.</p>
        <p>''The precedents are not particularly instructive,'' the vice president said recently. It is a sentiment we can all take to heart.</p>
