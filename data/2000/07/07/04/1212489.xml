        <p>The confirmation of his election as president of Mexico was still hours away, the victory real only in the computers of his pollsters, but Vicente Fox Quesada was already three steps down the road. There would be a quick sip of Champagne, a victory speech, and then he would get to work.</p>
        <p>''Right tomorrow I want to be working,'' Mr. Fox told an American journalist in between nonstop interviews handled over his ever-present cell phone. ''My hobby is work. It enchants me. I thoroughly enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, who turned 58 on the day that Mexicans elected him the first president in the nation's modern history from an opposition party, is nothing if not a man of considerable ambition and energy. He is a politician who once told his political marketing strategist to ''sell me'' like any other product.</p>
        <p>By background he is a rancher's son whose career has traversed business and politics. A manufacturer of cowboy boots and a former Coca-Cola executive, Mr. Fox entered politics by being elected a congressman and later was a governor.</p>
        <p>But perhaps more than anything else, Mr. Fox is a maverick. In Congress half of his votes followed the line of his conservative, pro-business party. The other half were leftist positions, many of them backed by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which he vanquished on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>Even before his campaign began, he was careful to manage expectations. ''Ending 70 years of dictatorship will be a great heroic exploit for Mexico,'' he said, ''something like when you Americans put a man on the moon. Reaching the moon took a decade of work, and defeating the ruling party will also require lots of time, talent and money.''</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Mr. Fox sought to allay fears that turmoil might result were he to prevail by pledging to form what he has called a government of transition. After his victory, he reiterated those promises, extending friendly messages to his rivals and calling for unity.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as governor of Guanajuato in central Mexico from 1995 until he resigned to campaign for president, Mr. Fox appointed a woman with ties to the PRI as his state auditor and enlisted the help of a member of the largest leftist party to devise programs to benefit rural women.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly the government he will lead will contrast sharply with those of the 13 consecutive PRI presidents before him, partly because he is likely to bring his business instincts to the job.</p>
        <p>When he formed his campaign team last fall, Mr. Fox asked a headhunting firm to locate superstar executives to act as his top aides. He is unabashed at using marketing techniques for political communication.</p>
        <p>''Look at me as a product, and figure out how to sell me,'' Mr. Fox said to Francisco Ortiz, the former Procter &amp; Gamble marketing wizard he hired to direct his broadcast campaign, Mr. Ortiz recalled in an interview.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Fox ran as the candidate of the center-right National Action Party, he reached out to leftist intellectuals across Latin America, and in discussion groups he demonstrated considerable political flexibility, said Jorge Castaneda, a liberal New York University professor and author who lives here part-time.</p>
        <p>''These people were from a different world, ideologically and socially, and he was learning how to get along,'' Mr. Castaneda said. ''These were establishment and leftist intellectuals. They dressed differently; they liked different things. To put it mildly, he was not in his element. But he'd sit down and he'd manage.''</p>
        <p>Dick Morris, the American political consultant, who worked for Mr. Fox, said: ''Vicente Fox is a phenomenon. This has not been a situation where the consultant runs the campaign. Fox has a chemistry with the people of Mexico that is beyond belief.''</p>
        <p>Born on July 2, 1942, in Mexico City, Mr. Fox spent his childhood on an 1,100-acre ranch in San Francisco del Rincon, Guanajuato, purchased during the Mexican Revolution by his paternal grandfather, an immigrant to Mexico of Irish descent.</p>
        <p>His mother, Mercedes Quesada, was born in Spain, a legal impediment for Mr. Fox's eventual political ambitions until a clause barring the children of immigrants from serving as president was eliminated from the Mexican Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has eight siblings. His father was a prosperous landholder, although not vastly wealthy in Mexican terms.</p>
        <p>''Something I'm proud of is that I became good friends with the children of the smallholders and peasants,'' he wrote in a campaign autobiography. ''With them I shared my infancy, my playthings, my house and my food. From that time I began to understand our country's painful inequalities.''</p>
        <p>A Catholic, he was educated by Jesuits and spent a year at an academy in Prairie du Chien, Wis., learning among other things how to speak fluent but accented English.</p>
        <p>He could be the most unapologetically religious of Mexico's modern presidents. The governing party that coalesced after the Mexican Revolution of 1917 had a strong anticlerical bias, and the armies of the revolutionary governments that ruled during the 1920's carried out a violent counterinsurgency against Catholic rebels in the west-central region that surrounds Mr. Fox's birthplace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has expressed historical fascination with the legacy of the Catholic insurgents, known as Cristeros, and during his campaign often ended rallies with a Cristero war cry: ''If I advance, follow me! If I stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!''</p>
        <p>If his predecessors have learned the country's local idiosyncracies as military men or as bureaucrats, Mr. Fox's sense for the texture of grass-roots life came as a route supervisor for Coke, working in six cities in seven years. After his transfer to Mexico City in 1971, he climbed to the top of Coke's corporate hierarchy, serving as its chief executive in Mexico from 1975 to 1979.</p>
        <p>''What I hated most about those years at Coca-Cola was the time I had to spend dithering with the government,'' he said recently, recalling how the president would convene meetings of Mr. Fox and hundreds of other business executives to the presidential palace ''so we could listen to a lot of foolishness.''</p>
        <p>In 1979, Coke offered to make Mr. Fox the head of its Latin American operations, which would have required that he move to Miami. Instead, he quit and returned to Guanajuato to work with his brothers.</p>
        <p>While at Coke, Mr. Fox married his secretary, Lillian de la Concha, and the couple adopted four children. They were divorced in 1991.</p>
        <p>The early 1980's saw many devaluations of the Mexican peso, and Mr. Fox has said that the harrowing experience of running a small business with a chaotic economy helped convince him of the need for political change.</p>
        <p>During that economic turmoil, Mexico's opposition forces were achieving their first major victories in local elections in the north, and in 1988 dozens of entrepreneurs ran for Congress representing the National Action Party, including Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>He won, served one term and then ran for governor in 1991, losing an election marred by fraud. Four years later he won. Three years into his governorship, he began his quest for the presidency.</p>
