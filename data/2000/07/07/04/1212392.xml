        <p>Like a new image suddenly materializing on a tapestry, a new species of bird has emerged from research in the sagebrush ecosystem of western Colorado and eastern Utah, according to scientists working there.</p>
        <p>The bird, the Gunnison sage grouse, named for the area of Colorado where it was discovered, has been in plain view all along -- seen, hunted as a game bird and, most spectacularly, heard at sunrise every spring as part of one of the avian world's oddest courtship rituals.</p>
        <p>The Gunnison sage grouse had long been assumed to be the same species as the related northern sage grouse, even though the two differ starkly in size, appearance, behavior, and now, it turns out, DNA.</p>
        <p>The discovery is rare news in the world of avian taxonomy. This appears to be the first instance in decades that a wholly new species of bird has been described in the continental United States.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Banks, an ornithologist with the Biological Resources Division of the United States Geological Survey, said, ''People find new species from time to time in South America, for example, on an isolated mountaintop no one's been to before. But reporting a new species in the U.S. is extremely unusual.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Banks, who manages the official catalog of bird species for the American Ornithological Union, said that no such event had occurred in his career, and might well reach back to the end of the 19th century.</p>
        <p>It is no small matter for bird-watchers seeking to add new species to lists of species viewed. A few of the most savvy have already begun pilgrimages to Colorado's Gunnison Basin in hope of being among the first to add a new species to their life lists. That trickle could turn into a flood after the bird is officially listed as a new species by the American Ornithological Union in its journal,  The Auk, later this month.</p>
        <p>''Word has only barely gotten out,'' Dr. Banks said. ''It really hasn't been publicized very much in public or in the popular journals that get to the bird-watchers -- that will happen in very short order, and people will be going en masse to add the bird to their lists.''</p>
        <p>Eager bird-watchers may not want to wait too long. Even before its status as a new species becomes official, scientists studying the species say it has suffered sharp declines in this century, and some environmentalists are already calling for the Gunnison sage grouse to be listed as an endangered species.</p>
        <p>Taxonomists acknowledge that the very process of deciding when a form constitutes a separate species can sometimes be a judgment call. In the past, physically distinct but closely related forms have either been ''lumped'' into one species, with each form classified as a subspecies, or ''split'' into two species.</p>
        <p>A scientific committee of the American Ornithological Union performs such hairsplitting based not only on differences in physical appearance, but on evidence of free interbreeding between two groups.  Two groups that are not freely interbreeding are presumed to be on separate evolutionary paths.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the Gunnison sage grouse was never even considered a subspecies of the more widely distributing northern sage grouse. There now appears to be little room for doubt that it is, in fact, a wholly distinct species. The creature not only does not interbreed with the northern sage grouse, the two are so strikingly different in both appearance and behavior that it seems almost a wonder that they could have ever been considered birds of the same heritage.</p>
        <p>In 1999, even more definitive evidence piled up, when detailed studies of the two groups' DNA showed that they were far too distantly related to be considered the same species. The findings were reported by Dr. Tom Quinn and Dr. Sara Oyler-McCance of Denver University.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the strongest cases that's ever been,'' says Dr. Jessica Young, a biologist at Colorado's Western State College, whose studies have been crucial to defining the species.</p>
        <p>Both the more common northern sage grouse and the Gunnison species indulge in one of the animal world's most peculiar mating routines. Male sage grouse are equipped with air sacs on their breasts, which they use in the early predawn hours  each spring, making a racket as they congregate in large groups, called leks, or strutting grounds. Their mating call, audible a mile or more away, has been compared to the sound of bubbles, or gulps, underwater.</p>
        <p>Typically, the most dominant and aggressive males position themselves in the center of the lek, fending off all pretenders to this throne. One by one, females visit the lek, choosing a mate based, as nearly as biologists can tell, on the quality of his bubbly noise-making and vigor and quality of a rapid head-shaking, strutting dance that accompanies it. The winner, almost always, turns out to be one of the most dominant males at the center of the lek, with one or two males often fathering almost all of the chicks born in a given year.</p>
        <p>It was sound from the strutting grounds that provided some of the first strong hints that the two groups might in fact be separate species. As an undergraduate at the University of California at San Diego in the 1980's, Dr. Young had found herself listening to and trying to analyze hundreds of tapes of northern sage grouse as part of a biology project. When some new tapes of sage grouse arrived from the Gunnison Basin, Dr. Young was startled at the differences in vocal patterns. While northern sage grouse consistently pop their air sacs twice in each of the many brief strut displays they perform, the Gunnison birds pop their air sacs nine times, and the sounds they produced are notably deeper.</p>
        <p>Dr. Young said that once she heard the tapes, she rounded up video and audio recorders, a mini-van, a portable bird blind, and her mother, who drove with her directly to Colorado to make more recordings. That outing turned into a career.</p>
        <p>Dr. Young continued to specialize in studies of the Gunnison grouse while receiving a Ph.D. at Purdue  and, later, after being named to the faculty at Western State, which is in Gunnison.</p>
        <p>Her chief collaborator, Dr. Clait Braun, recently retired as avian research program manager for Colorado Division of Wildlife, says he began to suspect that the Gunnison grouse were a separate subspecies, but not a full species, as early as the late 1970's, when his surveys of sage grouse wings turned in by hunters proved that grouse in the Gunnison Basin were remarkably smaller than sage grouse shot elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Braun says he was ''too conservative'' to come to the extraordinary conclusion that the Gunnison grouse was indeed a separate species. He says Dr. Young, in time, simply compiled too much evidence, including ''exquisite behavioral findings,'' to conclude otherwise.</p>
        <p>Physically, aside from the differences in size, the Gunnison grouse have different coloration and patterns in their feathers, including white bands on their tail feathers. Beyond the differences in vocal performances, the Gunnison males perform a different sort of strut, tossing their elaborate neck feathers, or filoplume, over their heads like pony tails, and wagging their tail feathers at the end of the display. When Dr. Young tried to play Gunnison grouse sounds in the territories of northern sage grouse, the northern females actively shunned the area, repelled.  And the same occurred when she tried to romance Gunnison females with the sounds of northern sage grouse males.</p>
        <p>''She really made the case that under all the concepts of what makes a species, these birds were really different,'' Dr. Braun said. ''Her case eventually became overwhelming.''</p>
        <p>But the two researchers also found that the species they had just discovered was in serious peril. ''At the same time we realized we had a distinct species, we also realized we had fewer than 5,000 of them left,'' Dr. Young said.</p>
        <p>Word of the bird's survival problems preceded even its formal designation as a species. In January, American Lands, an environmental group in Portland, Ore., petitioned the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for an emergency listing of the Gunnison sage grouse as an endangered species, and that agency has begun a review of the petition.</p>
        <p>Dr. Randy Webb, a consulting biologist and lawyer in Eugene, Ore., who prepared the petition for the environmental group, said he was shocked at the state of sage grouse in general when the group first asked him to look at the bird's status. Dr. Webb said historical accounts suggested that across the great sweep of the arid intermountain West, sage grouse were once extremely abundant.</p>
        <p>''There are stories about them blackening the skies,'' he said. ''Of kids going out with a stick to round up grouse for dinner, and of market hunters loading them up by the wagonload. This is a species that in its ecosystem used to be an ecological dominant, like buffalo or salmon.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Webb estimates that numbers of the more abundant northern sage grouse have decreased by 90 percent or more, from somewhere beyond one million birds in the West to perhaps 100,000. But the status of the Gunnison sage grouse, he said, ''is much, much worse.''</p>
