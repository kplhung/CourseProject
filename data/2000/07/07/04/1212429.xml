        <p>The man who sold the Declaration of Independence: now there's one the Colonials could not pin on Benedict Arnold, a frustrated careerist angry at being passed over for a promotion.

        <p>It was the second time that Mr. Redden had sold that particular copy of the declaration, one of 25 surviving from a batch printed on July 4, 1776.

        <p>The man who sold the Declaration of Independence: now there's one the Colonials could not pin on Benedict Arnold, a frustrated careerist angry at being passed over for a promotion. David N. Redden, auction-house careerist, sounds neither frustrated nor angry: he got the promotion, to vice chairman of Sotheby's, in February. Last week, he sold the declaration, for $7.4 million.</p>
        <p>It was the second time that Mr. Redden had sold that particular copy of the declaration, one of 25 surviving from a batch printed on July 4, 1776. The first time, in 1991, it went for $2.2 million. Before that, before the well-tailored auctioneer was involved, it was a $4 flea-market item hidden in a the frame behind a bargain hunter's second-rate painting.</p>
        <p>Another coup for the careerist, but no traitorous thoughts, please -- Mr. Redden, 51, was too busy to think about defecting to, say, Christie's. ''The auction process to me is almost magic,'' declares the man who has sold everything from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' belongings to a Tyrannosaurus rex fossil to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's furniture. Along the way, he also did some big spending, but that wasn't his $50 million, it was $50 million from Scenic Hudson, a preservation group of which he was chairman.</p>
        <p>''We bought the mountaintops,'' he says, as well as land opposite Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y. ''It was going to be a Wal-Mart,'' he says in his English accent, a legacy of several childhood years in London. ''A Wal-Mart!''</p>
        <p>Not Mr. Redden's kind of place -- he spends his days in a quiet, carpeted cubicle at Sotheby's glass-box headquarters at York Avenue and 72nd Street. His is not a world with public-address announcements that begin, ''Attention, shoppers.''</p>
        <p>He was born in Canton, China, nine months before the Communists evicted the family -- his father had been the American consul. The English accent masks the drama: ''We were fired on as we left.''</p>
        <p>A few postings later, London. ''There was my father representing the United States,'' he says, ''and I was becoming solidly English.'' A history teacher named Plantagenet Somerset Fry made an impression. Is it a surprise that when Mr. Somerset Fry quit teaching, he went into antiques? Or that Mr. Redden has collected 20 books his teacher wrote when he quit the antiques business?</p>
        <p>''I'd had a museum when I was 10 years old -- bird's eggs, shells,'' he says. Seashells? No, artillery shells from World War II. He found one -- ''a canister with fins'' -- on a heath next to an aunt's and uncle's ''rather grand house.''</p>
        <p>''I carried it back,'' he says. ''The butler grabbed it, it was that kind of establishment. There was a lake, and he threw it into the lake.'' There was no explosion, no drama and, in Mr. Redden's telling, no reprimand. It was that kind of establishment.</p>
        <p>AT Wesleyan University, he says, ''I became deeply engaged in the activities of the time.'' The time was the late 1960's, and once again, the English accent serves as a mask: he is talking about antiwar demonstrations and how he simply picked up the phone and called Mark Rudd, who led the 1968 student strike at Columbia University and later spent seven years as a Weather Underground fugitive.</p>
        <p>''There was some consternation in the dorm that he called me back and invited me to come down,'' Mr. Redden says. He remembers seeing the police attack demonstrators at Columbia and sitting in on a strategy session at Sarah Lawrence College: the demonstrators debated smashing the fine-looking French furniture in the building they had just taken over. ''I'm sure it was all reproduction,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Back at Wesleyan, he studied art history (''a great handle on civilization, but it's not necessarily going to lead to an obvious career''). In his case, though, it did: Sotheby's hired him as an $8,500-a-year catalog trainee. Within six years, he was running PB-84, a short-lived satellite at which Sotheby's sold lower-price art and antiques. ''I became an auctioneer very quickly in a way that wouldn't happen nowadays: I was told to go up to the podium and get going,'' he says. ''I was terrified, so terrified I forgot to write down the sale prices of the first 20 lots I sold.''</p>
        <p>Still, he was hooked on the excitement and, he says, the ''public benefit'' of what Sotheby's does.</p>
        <p>Public benefit? How does he reconcile that with a federal antitrust investigation into whether Sotheby's colluded with Christie's on commissions? ''Not well,'' he said. ''I was stunned by that and remain bewildered. All I know is two people resigned amid allegations of what to me is inconceivable behavior.'' (The two were Sotheby's chairman, Alfred A. Taubman, and its chief executive, Diana D. Brooks. Sotheby's has denied the allegations.)</p>
        <p>Sotheby's credits Mr. Redden with developing its Internet strategy, but the dot-com world surged ahead of his expectations. No under-$3,000 bargains here. When he sold the Declaration of Independence to the television producer Norman Lear and the Internet entrepreneur David Hayden last week, he was off by a factor of almost 2,500.</p>
        <p>''The Declaration of Independence is just a piece of paper,'' he says. ''In determining its value, you can explain it to other people, and it becomes precious to them, too, and you've done more than just make the document worth $4 million or $5 million, you've actually done something significant. That's the irony in a capitalistic society: by conferring value on an object, you save it.''</p>
