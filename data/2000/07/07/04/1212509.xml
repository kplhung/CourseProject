        <p>Mike Meehan, a geologist who once explored for coal in the Appalachian Mountains, is supervising a crew of four men and a canary yellow backhoe, clawing away at the cliffs of the country's only operating brownstone quarry, trying to fill the orders that pour in every day.</p>
        <p>''See those chunks with the CU on 'em?'' he asked a few weeks ago, pointing to some big rocks the color of fudge and the size of a Doberman's doghouse. ''They're for the Cooper Union in New York City. And those over there are going to the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Providence, and that's a stoop going to Yale. Those pieces there are for the cornice trim on a new house going up in the Farmington Valley.''</p>
        <p>Brownstone is back. That somber yet elegant cloak for more than 50,000 row houses, from Baltimore to Boston, was revered during the so-called Brown Decades of the mid-19th century, then reviled by the century's turn, when gleaming white limestone and marble captivated the public.</p>
        <p>For the last six decades, Portland's quarries -- which produced an estimated 80 percent of New York City's brownstone -- have been largely forgotten by the outside world. Already moribund by the start of the Great Depression, they filled with water after the flood of 1936 and the hurricane of 1938, were discovered by teenagers as a make-out spot and were adopted by fishermen who stealthily hunt big bass near the towering brownstone cliffs.</p>
        <p>But preservationists and planners are beginning to see a new future for the formidable stone. Architects have started using it to give a touch of historical sobriety to new suburban palazzos, and conservators have begun restoring the elegant facades of grand monuments like the Cooper Union on  Astor Place in Manhattan, where Abraham Lincoln addressed crowds before the 1860 election. On May 16, the Department of the Interior gave three Portland quarries (two defunct) status as a national historic landmark.</p>
        <p>But just as this Connecticut River town in the center of the state is sponsoring brainstorming sessions on how to lure visitors, the re-opening of the third Portland quarry has set off a debate on whether brownstone should be used at all.</p>
        <p>Because the terrible secret is that brownstone -- ''the very blood and fiber of New York City,'' in the words of Vincent Scully, a professor emeritus of the history of art at Yale University -- is not really much good as a building material. The same quality that gives brownstone its charm, making it easy to quarry and easy to carve, also makes it exquisitely vulnerable to harsh weather and the passage of time, especially if the stone is installed improperly, and even worse, is maintained poorly.</p>
        <p>At the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Albany, built in 1848 from Portland stone, its preservation architect, John Mesick, said, ''you can take your hand and pull off chunks as big as apple pies.''</p>
        <p>Throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, many of the most magnificent brownstone houses, the ones that date from the Civil War era, are in danger of losing their sweeping balustraded staircases and their entire facades. At the National Arts Club, in Gramercy Park in Manhattan, the brownstone, like a chocolate bar left on the dashboard on a summer day, just seemed to melt.</p>
        <p>Alex Herrera, director of technical services at the New York Landmarks Conservancy, said that the brownstone veneer on the facades on some of the houses began to fall off a few years after they were built. ''Historical records state that some started deteriorating 10, 20, 30 years later,'' he said. ''Brownstone is not a consistent material: some of it is O.K., and some is perfectly awful.''</p>
        <p>Not that anyone is building all-new brownstone houses; the architect Philip Johnson was the last to use it in a major way, for the Bobst Library at New York University back in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Today, it is brownstone repair and replacement that is being debated in classrooms, at special seminars and landmark commissions. Should the real brownstone be used, or a cheap ''cut and cover'' brown stucco coating favored by contractors?</p>
        <p>''It's a very controversial subject right now,'' said Paul Byard, director of Columbia University's preservation program, and the architect for the Cooper Union's $12 million brownstone restoration, the largest  in history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byard has chosen Portland brownstone, which he says is authentic and should last for at least six decades if maintained, with the joints kept properly full of mortar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesick says he will not use it on the Albany Cathedral and is combing southern Scotland and the Ruhr Valley in Germany for brownstone that does not spall, or flake off, the way he says the Connecticut stone does.</p>
        <p>There is even a long-running debate on whether it is aesthetically pleasing. While many still find the stone beautiful, Edith Wharton could not stand the stuff. In a memoir published four years before the Portland quarries shut down, she told of her childhood return to New York from Europe, her writer's voice dripping with disappointment at ''this low-studded rectangular New York, cursed with its universal chocolate-colored coating of the most hideous stone ever quarried.''</p>
        <p>The brownstone of the Portland quarries was formed roughly 200 million years ago, when Connecticut was a hot and humid savanna, with a major rainy season that created streams and rivers that eroded the Paleozoic rocks of the Eastern Highlands.  As the rains tapered off, the dinosaurs lumbered through, leaving their footprints in the mud -- footprints that are still being uncovered by Mr. Meehan's crew at the quarry, who spend part of their time each day showing off the prints to schoolchildren and other visitors.</p>
        <p>The streams left deposits of mudstone, shale and sand. This sediment, composed of quartz, mica and feldspar, became brownstone.</p>
        <p>The English first settled Portland in the 1600's, using the reddish-brown stone -- far easier to carve than granite -- for gravestones. During the 1700's, the town operated one of the quarries and offered the stone free to its inhabitants. By the mid-19th century, the quarries were controlled by three main companies, and they employed 1,500 workers, a third of them Irish. Over the years, the quarries sent more than 5 million cubic yards of brownstone down the Connecticut River.</p>
        <p>While some blasting was involved, much of it just fell away from the cliffs, not unlike the way it is now falling from facades.</p>
        <p>Ralph Lewis, a geologist who was in Portland for a recent seminar on the quarries, said brownstone ''erodes very quickly, it's very soft.'' He added, ''And if you build with the wrong layer, it flakes off.''</p>
        <p>That is what happened with so many of New York City's brownstones -- they were built with the wrong layer.</p>
        <p>Everett H. Ortner, who in 1968 helped found the Brownstone Revival Committee in New York City, said, ''In the beginning, they selected the very best material.'' But with the speculative rush in the post-Civil War years, the quality went downhill fast.</p>
        <p>''Stone had always been the material of the aristocracy, and wood or brick that of the middle class,'' Mr. Ortner said. ''Suddenly the middle class could have the permanence -- an impression of permanence that wood never could have.''</p>
        <p>In the brownstone heyday, quarries operated up and down the East Coast, from Paterson, N.J., to Longmeadow, Mass., and beyond. Portland's were the biggest, but alas, its stone was one of the softest.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities bluntly declared in a brochure on brownstone care, ''Portland brownstone is notorious for its poor durability.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Meehan, who owns the quarry, and the local town officials here, dispute that contention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meehan, 50, plans to ship 1,250 tons from his small quarry this year, about $500,000 worth of stone. He just sent out 11 truckloads of brownstone to add decorative accents to a 40,000-square-foot house going up in Michigan. A new saw from Italy is on order, designed to bore down into the rock after he has exhausted the cliffs.</p>
        <p>Asked about brownstone's reputation as a fragile building material, Edward L. Kalinowski, Portland's first selectman, said, ''I don't believe it.'' His grandfather worked in the quarries until the mid-1930's, when a giant slab of rock crushed his leg.</p>
        <p>The reason that Portland stone did not last, Mr. Kalinowski and others say, was either because it was installed improperly, or because bad stone was used.</p>
        <p>When the quarries were running at a normal pace, half of the brownstone was thrown away, used for railway embankments or crushed for gravel.</p>
        <p>But in the mid-1800's, the pressure was on to produce more and more stone for building facades in America's major cities. According to historians, Portland began shipping some substandard material.</p>
        <p>''In the brownstone heyday, the speculators didn't care,'' said Alison Guinness, the curator of the Connecticut River Museum and the author of a paper on the history of the Portland quarries. ''They just wanted it, and they slapped it up.''</p>
        <p>The brownstone was meant to be installed with its striations facing out and the flat side facing up. Unfortunately, it was easier, quicker and cheaper (and better looking, too) for the builders to place it on the front of a building with its flat side facing out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meehan explained: ''It's like a book; if you put it out in the rain with its spine facing up, the water will run down the pages. If you lay it down flat, the water won't get inside.''</p>
        <p>That is why there are so few gravestones left: they were stuck in the ground with the flat side facing the front. The rain soaked into the striations, and the stone fell apart.</p>
        <p>Over the last century, decaying stone was largely repaired by chipping it off and applying a brown-colored stucco. How many row houses have been treated this way? ''Are you kidding?'' Mr. Herrera responded. ''Thousands.''</p>
        <p>As the patches fade and change color, they begin to look like camouflage. The stucco mixture also must be perfect, he said, ''otherwise, it's like chocolate pudding.''</p>
        <p>Increasingly, experts say, masonry contractors are persuading some homeowners to chip away everything and replace the whole facade with a stucco, at a cost that can range from $20,000 to $60,000, depending on the contractor. This approach, which critics say lasts 20 years at the most, makes preservationists tremble.</p>
        <p>''Especially since they re-opened the Portland quarry, I like to see real stone for replacement,'' said Ivan Myjer, a stone conservator from Boston who directed the restoration at St. John the Divine in New York City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myjer, who hand-picked the stone for the Cooper Union and is supervising its use, argues that real brownstone can be installed for probably no more than $60,000 and lasts longer than a concrete job, between 60 and 100 years, he says.</p>
        <p>Yet the favored method in New York City is still concrete, even for the rich.</p>
        <p>Marc Adami, a masonry contractor who specializes in brownstone restoration, recently finished a brownstone-colored concrete job and total renovation on Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which he said cost over $1 million.</p>
        <p>''The guy's in the stock market -- he makes $300,000 a minute -- and he had his own face, his wife's face, his two daughter's faces cast and put at the top of columns in front of his house,'' the contractor said. ''Now that's a brownstone restoration job!''</p>
