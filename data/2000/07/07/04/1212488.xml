        <p>Voters in Mexico End A Monopoly on Power  Election returns showed that Mexican voters handed the opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox Quesada a substantially more decisive victory over the governing party on Sunday than any poll had predicted. With almost all ballots counted, Mr. Fox had 43 percent, to 36 percent for Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the party that has governed Mexico for 71 years. But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of power in Mexico's history, no major party, including Mr. Fox's center-right party, will control either house of Congress.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mexicans seemed stunned but excited by Mr. Fox's triumph, and a feeling of empowerment echoed among people of many backgrounds.</p>

        <p>Austrian Warning to Europe  Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said sanctions imposed by the European Union five months ago to punish the country for letting the far-right Freedom Party into the government would have to be lifted before Austria would clear the way for the 15-member body to admit any new countries. Such admissions require unanimous approval.</p>

        <p>In Rome, Pride and Conflict  Bishop Jacques Gaillot of France, whose superiors had told him the pope wanted him to withdraw from a seminar that is part of a major gay pride event in Rome this week, said he believed that the church had erred in its treatment of homosexuals. The event, World Pride Roma 2000, is timed to coincide with a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church. Vatican opposition has elevated the event into a tense political battleground.</p>

        <p>P.L.O. Plan for Statehood  Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization decided in Gaza City that a Palestinian state should be declared by mid-September, whether or not a permanent peace deal had been reached with the Israelis. The move expressed general Palestinian frustration with the peace effort while also locking Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, into a tight, potentially explosive time frame.</p>

        <p>Gore Links Drug Makers And G.O.P. to High Costs  Vice President Al Gore accused drug makers of ''price-gouging'' and ''special interest schemes'' to keep prices high, as he began a weeklong drive on an issue that has emerged as one of the most potent this election season -- the rising cost of prescription drugs. His speech to an elderly crowd in Missouri also sought to link Gov. George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
