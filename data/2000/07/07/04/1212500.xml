        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The coverage of the genome announcement (June 27) has included relatively little about the most dangerous potential of our new knowledge about human genetics: the fast-approaching ability to manipulate the genes we pass on to our children.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, a number of well-known scientists and others have recently made strong statements advocating this application of human genetic engineering. They acknowledge that developing this technology may well lead to an unprecedented kind and degree of inequality, to the emergence of a genetic overclass and underclass, but claim that its development and use are inevitable.</p>
        <p>Many countries have passed or are considering legislation to ban this kind of manipulation. The United States should do the same.</p>
        <p>It would take a tin ear to miss the hopes for medical innovation embedded in the task that geneticist scientists have accomplished. But it's a blind eye that fails to see the profound dangers we face.  DR. MARCY DARNOVSKY  Rohnert Park, Calif.</p>
