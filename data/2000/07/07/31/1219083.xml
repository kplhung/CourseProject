        <p>Almost everything for sale in Turkey has two prices: a sticker price, for goods sold with an invoice or receipt, and a much lower price, if the buyer pays cash. The consumer avoids the hefty 17 percent value-added sales tax and the seller can hide the income and escape corporate and income taxes.</p>
        <p>The only obvious loser is the government and, indirectly, society as a whole. The losses to the Turkish treasury from the flourishing cash economy and other schemes to conceal income are impossible to calculate. But new government statistics have hinted at the vast scale of tax evasion among business owners and self-employed people in this country of 65 million.</p>
        <p>Based on income reported to the government, the best-paid professionals in Turkey are notaries, who stamp official documents. Last year, the average income declared by the country's 576 notaries was about $53,000, more than 10 times the reported earnings of lawyers and doctors, nearly 30 times as high as dentists. Even artists said they were paid more than engineers, lawyers, doctors and dentists.</p>
        <p>Shoe manufacturers, furniture dealers and clothing store owners were among the categories in which people reported earning less than the minimum wage of about $138 a month.</p>
        <p>Obviously, nobody believes the figures, sensing that they reflect the fact that notaries must provide a receipt for every transaction, just as artists must provide provenance and valuation of their works. Other self-employed people routinely accept cash without an invoice or shift payments to offshore bank accounts.</p>
        <p>Another new statistic raised questions about how many people even report their earnings. In the last 15 years, Turkey's population has grown 30 percent and the number of taxpayers has risen only 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Tax evasion is certainly not unique to Turkey, but it is challenging the country's efforts to control inflation and pay civil servants a decent wage and thus to try to complete the transformation from developing to developed nation.</p>
        <p>''If a government can't raise taxes, they can't run a proper government or pay their civil servants enough to keep them honest,'' said Jeremy Pope, executive director of Transparency International, an organization that tracks government corruption.</p>
        <p>As is often the case when governments collect only a fraction of the taxes they are owed, tax rates are high in Turkey. Corporations pay about 40 percent in income tax and individual rates go as high as 55 percent. The Ministry of Finance has estimated in recent years that 5 percent to 10 percent of taxes due go unpaid, but most experts view those figures as conservative.</p>
        <p>Under prodding from the International Monetary Fund as a condition for a $3.9 billion loan, Turkey is working on reforms. New rules were adopted in 1998 to increase compliance by basing taxes on declared earnings instead of the former assessment of standard of living, but the results are widely ridiculed.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance agreed that tax evasion is a serious problem and that reported income is often far lower than actual earnings.</p>
        <p>For now, cash transactions -- and accompanying discounts -- are prevalent, from the restaurant owner who increases the bill for patrons paying by credit card to the lawyer who instructs foreign clients to pay fees into an offshore bank account.</p>
        <p>''The commercial ethic has disappeared and honesty is called stupidity,'' Mehmet Yildirim, chairman of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, was quoted as saying in a local newspaper recently.</p>
        <p>From the doorway of his men's clothing shop near the bustling Misir Carsisi, or spice bazaar, Sabri Kefeli sees the issue in terms of economic survival. Surrounded by sidewalk vendors with no overhead and other competitors, he said he has little choice but to please the customer.</p>
        <p>''Customers say: 'I am not going to take a receipt. What can you do for me on price?' '' he said. ''I must go along.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, Mr. Kefeli said, he is left to make up receipts to account for his sales.</p>
        <p>Metin Tozlu has no such options, he explained as he sat in his second-floor office on the same street. Unlike his neighbor, Mr. Tozlu must provide receipts for every transaction and make detailed reports to the authorities. He is a notary.</p>
        <p>Asked if notaries make more than doctors and lawyers, Mr. Tozlu,  chairman of the city's 193 notaries, gestured to his modest quarters. ''What do you think?'' he asked. ''If everybody paid as a notary pays, then we wouldn't be at the top of list.''</p>
        <p>There is a dispute about who are the biggest tax cheats. Labor union representatives argue that civil servants and other types of workers whose taxes are deducted from their paychecks pay more than their share. Representatives of big business blame small shop owners and the self-employed for shifting too much of the burden to the corporate side of the ledger.</p>
        <p>''Many segments of society lack the discipline of paying taxes,'' said Erkut Yucaoglu, chairman of an association representing the country's 2,000 largest businesses. ''The problem is creating the resources to enlarge the tax base through enforcement.''</p>
        <p>More than revenue is at stake. When laws are flouted, it breeds distrust in government and resentment in the social order. ''If there is no justice in the tax system, the divide will widen and society will lose confidence in the state,'' cautioned Yahya Arikan, chairman of the city's association of accountants and financial consultants.</p>
        <p>A lawyer at a top Istanbul firm  said that in addition to many lawyers' asking that fees be paid into offshore accounts, proceeds from major business transactions are often deposited in foreign banks. ''My suggestion is to audit everyone who bought a Jeep Cherokee or Range Rover last year,'' the lawyer said.</p>
