        <p>Yesterday turned out to be a day to kick the tires, check the oil and generally make sure everything was ready for the big event -- and to see how many times on how many channels Dick Cheney could be asked the same half-dozen questions before he would reach over and strangle his interrogator with his microphone cord.</p>
        <p>Many of the Web sites threatening round-the-clock coverage of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia had not yet begun streaming, but the Sunday morning television talk shows were filled with nothing else -- and already there was not an hour in the day when some sort of convention-related snippet could not be found on one or another channel.</p>

        <p>Yesterday turned out to be a day to kick the tires, check the oil and generally make sure everything was ready for the big event -- and to see how many times on how many channels Dick Cheney could be asked the same half-dozen questions before he would reach over and strangle his interrogator with his microphone cord.</p>
        <p>Many of the Web sites threatening round-the-clock coverage of the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia had not yet begun streaming, but the Sunday morning television talk shows were filled with nothing else -- and already there was not an hour in the day when some sort of convention-related snippet could not be found on one or another channel.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia, you know, is home to cheesesteaks. Its downtown has had a major renaissance. Under Democrats! Cheesesteaks are made with thinly sliced rib-eye steak and served  with or without onions. The first televised presidential convention was also held in Philadelphia, 52 years ago. And now, the city is host to the first convention to be given the full Internet treatment. This point was made several times, on several channels. Indeed, a whole new news media area has been set up for Web journalists at the convention. It is being called Internet Alley. Tours were available on at least two networks.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's vice-presidential choice, Mr. Cheney, was on  ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, ''This Week'' on ABC, ''Fox News Sunday'' and ''Late Edition With Wolf Blitzer'' on CNN (which bills itself as ''the last word in Sunday talk,'' would that it were true).</p>
        <p>Displaying none of the puppy-dog enthusiasm that former Vice President Dan Quayle exhibited when chosen by Governor Bush's father in 1988, Mr. Cheney was an ostentatiously subdued presence in his marathon of interviews.</p>
        <p>On Fox, he described President Clinton as an ''enormous embarrassment to the country,'' who was also a ''tragic figure'' with fundamental flaws. This was about as close to controversy as Mr. Cheney allowed himself to get. He complained about being interrogated about Congressional votes he had cast two decades ago -- opposing bans on plastic guns, for example, and against the Clean Water Act -- and said it was all part of a Democratic plan to demonize him.</p>
        <p>''This is exactly the sort of thing we've seen in the Gore campaign,'' Mr. Cheney told the host of ''Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert. ''Attack, attack.''</p>
        <p>''Meet the Press'' had the Democratic strategist James Carville and the Republican strategist William J. Bennett to kick things around. Mr. Bennett said that the soon-to-be Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore, had been exhibiting ''several personalities'' in recent months, including ''affable Al'' and ''Uncle Al the Kiddies' Pal,'' none of which were catching on with voters. Unfair, Mr. Carville said, ''the vice president has not yet had a chance to emerge.''</p>
        <p>On ''This Week,'' they went with a tag-team format. First, Sam Donaldson did a semi-aggressive number on Mr. Cheney, to little effect.</p>
        <p>''So far, I am not bleeding from any part of my body,'' Mr. Cheney observed. Then, Cokie Roberts was ingratiating and chatty with Lynne Cheney, the candidate's wife, who got her back up when the questions turned to the sexual orientation of one of their daughters. ''I am appalled at the media interest in my two daughters,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Face the Nation'' had what it called an ''exclusive'' talk with Senator John McCain, Governor Bush's chief opponent in the primaries (although Mr. McCain had already been heard from on Sunday morning's edition of ''Today'').</p>
        <p>Some had wondered, somewhat optimistically, whether Mr. McCain would enliven the otherwise cut-and-dried convention by saying something intemperate, but he made it clear he would be a good boy. ''Governor Bush has been running exactly the sort of campaign I would be running,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest display of emotion came during ''Late Edition,'' when a Democratic strategist, Robert Shrum, and the former Republican Party chief Haley Barbour took each other on. For a few moments, there was such partisan rancor that it was like a blast from a previous decade.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, even the Internet offered little escape from drama-free reasonableness.</p>
        <p>The party's official convention site, www.gopconvention.com, included items like a ''Test Your G.O.P. I.Q.'' quiz (How many times has the party met in Philadelphia? Six.) and a discussion of how the ''convention experience'' has changed since Republicans were last in Philadelphia, in 1948 (''One of the biggest changes: The first-ever free shuttle service for convention participants'').</p>
        <p>A section marked ''Why conventions?'' could be bookmarked for later, when it may come in handy. There was also an advertisement that said, ''Ask for G.O.P. rates at aruba-rentals.com,'' and a secure on-line connection for those wishing to make immediate campaign contributions.</p>
        <p>On C-Span, one segment included a woman using a felt-tipped pen and a map to show exactly where each of the delegations would be sitting on the convention floor, one by one. Later, Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, showed up to take calls from C-Span viewers. Had Mr. Cheney appeared on CBS that morning, he was asked?</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' he said, a little ruefully. ''Everywhere.''</p>
