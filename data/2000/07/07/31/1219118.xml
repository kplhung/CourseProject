        <p>The Olympic swimming star Claudia Poll and her longtime coach, Francisco Rivas, both laugh when they share memories of their early days together at a country club in Costa Rica. Poll, 7 years old at the time, was hardly the model student.</p>
        <p>''Claudia was not a good swimmer,'' Rivas said. ''She was slow, very slow. She would always come late to practice or not come at all.''</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, Poll provides an explanation. ''I was having fun at that age,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Poll is a little more serious these days. She is busy training for the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, where she will try to retain the gold medal -- the first ever for Costa Rica -- that she won in the 200-meter freestyle in the 1996 Atlanta Games. So far, so good. During the Janet Evans Invitational this month in Los Angeles she established a meet record in the 200 meters at 1 minute 58.02 seconds. She also won the 400-meter freestyle in 4:09.04.</p>
        <p>At 27, Poll is getting old for a world-class swimmer. Yet she remains as passionate about her sport as ever, which she largely attributes to her belated start; Poll did not get serious about swimming until she was 13 or 14.</p>
        <p>''It was good not to push me at an early age,'' said Poll, who will also swim in the 4x100-meter freestyle at Sydney and may even enter the 800-meter competition. ''Many swimmers, when they begin at 8 or 9 years old, get bored when they're 15 or 16. I'm 27 and I still want to continue.''</p>
        <p>No wonder. She has a whole nation behind her.</p>
        <p>''People in Costa Rica love Claudia,'' Rivas said. ''She's more famous than the president.''</p>
        <p>Her path to fame, however, has had its obstacles. First, she had to overcome the loss of her father, Bernado, an agricultural engineer who died of a heart attack when she was 10. Even today, the pain is not too far from the surface.</p>
        <p>''When I swim, I always remember him,'' said Poll, tears quickly welling up in her eyes. ''Whether I swim well or swim poorly, I think he would be proud of me.''</p>
        <p>Poll also had to deal with the inevitable comparisons with her older  sister, Silvia, who preceded her to Olympic glory by winning the silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle at the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea, and was also coached by Rivas. Many younger siblings of great athletes falter under such pressure; Poll flourished.</p>
        <p>''We had different careers with different expectations,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Just to be safe, Rivas moved Poll along slowly so she would not have to compete against her sister, who is older by two and a half years.</p>
        <p>''When Silvia was done, it was Claudia's time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rivas and Claudia have formed a special relationship in their 20 years together.</p>
        <p>''He's a father to me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At first, Rivas, who was close to Poll's father, corrected his student's interpretation. ''We're good friends,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when he was asked if she feels like a daughter to him, Rivas, who has two children of his own, took only the slightest pause and then smiled. ''Maybe,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Their bond comes in handy when it becomes necessary to make adjustments in the middle of a meet. The Evans event was a perfect example.</p>
        <p>During the preliminaries for the 400-meter competition, Rivas, armed as usual with his camcorder, noticed that Poll had gotten off to a poor start. When he first told her, she did not believe him. But, hours later, the two watched the videotape together at their hotel. Poll had no argument.</p>
        <p>Rivas told Poll she needed to concentrate better, that, at this level, anybody could beat her. That night, nobody beat her. Her time in the final established a meet record. A day later, she won the 200-meter freestyle, breaking the meet record set by her sister.</p>
        <p>With Sydney less than two months away, Poll is planning to train six hours a day, six days a week. The pressure, though, is not as intense this time.</p>
        <p>''This is different from Atlanta,'' she said. ''I already have the gold medal.''</p>
