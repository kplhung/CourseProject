        <p>The Democratic Party released a television advertisement yesterday that criticizes the conservative legislative record of Dick Cheney, the Republicans' presumed vice-presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>The Democratic message is that Mr. Cheney's votes as a member of Congress from Wyoming in the 1980's are inconsistent with Gov. George W. Bush's promise of ''compassionate conservatism.'' The commercial is scheduled to be broadcast beginning Monday in 17 battleground states.</p>

        <p>The Democratic Party released a television advertisement yesterday that criticizes the conservative legislative record of Dick Cheney, the Republicans' presumed vice-presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>The Democratic message is that Mr. Cheney's votes as a member of Congress from Wyoming in the 1980's are inconsistent with Gov. George W. Bush's promise of ''compassionate conservatism.'' The commercial is scheduled to be broadcast beginning Monday in 17 battleground states.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Governor Bush, said the advertisement continued the Democratic strategy of ''selectively distorting a good man's record.'' He said the commercial would hurt Vice President Al Gore because the American people disliked negative campaigning.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second spot opens with a tight shot of Mr. Bush then widens to show Mr. Cheney standing by his side. The rest of the commercial simply shows a still picture of Mr. Cheney with text about his votes on education, the environment and health care legislation.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- A narrator reads: ''George W. Bush chose Dick Cheney to help lead the Republican Party. What does Cheney's record say about their plans? Cheney was one of only eight members of Congress to oppose the Clean Water Act. One of the few to vote against Head Start. He even voted against the school lunch program; against health insurance for people who lost their jobs. Cheney, an oil company C.E.O., said it was good for OPEC to cut production so oil and gasoline prices could rise. What are their plans for working families?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercial accurately reports Mr. Cheney's votes on these issues, but Mr. Cheney says several of them were cast during a time of large budget deficits when he believed the government could not afford to expand social programs. He also said his record on the environment reflected the views of his constituents in Wyoming.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Democrats believe that Mr. Cheney's voting record and his background as an oil industry executive offer rich targets for attack. This hastily produced spot is an effort to define Mr. Cheney as a rock-hard Republican conservative before Republican image-makers at the convention that opens tonight can soften the edges. It intensifies a week of attacks on Mr. Cheney's record, which began the day Mr. Bush announced that Mr. Cheney would be his running mate. But polls taken since the announcement have shown Mr. Bush increasing his lead over Mr. Gore.</p>
