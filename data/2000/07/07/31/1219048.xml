        <p>The forerunner of bridge was whist, in which there was no bidding and no dummy. The 19th-century authority on that game was Henry Jones, an Englishman who took the pseudonym Cavendish.

        <p>The forerunner of bridge was whist, in which there was no bidding and no dummy. The 19th-century authority on that game was Henry Jones, an Englishman who took the pseudonym Cavendish. Wishing to prove to unbelievers that whist was a game of skill rather than luck, he had a clever thought. He set up a table with two experts playing against two moderate performers. At another table he arranged for the play of the same deals, with two other experts playing with the opposite cards against two lesser lights.</p>
        <p>As he predicted, the four experts took considerably more tricks than the opposition. He had accidentally invented duplicate play, which has been the backbone of the game ever since.</p>
        <p>The whist players developed three rules of thumb: cover an honor with an honor, third player play high, and second player play low. Bridge players, who have the advantage of seeing a dummy, know that the first two are highly unreliable, with many exceptions. But the rule for the second player is well founded. The exceptions are not obvious, and the beginner who plays second-hand-high is wrong far more often than not.</p>
        <p>If the declarer leads a low card from his hand toward a doubleton honor in the dummy, the second player should never play the ace. Never? No, never. Never? Well, hardly ever, as the captain of H.M.S. Pinafore was wont to say.</p>
        <p>The exceptions are hard to spot, even for experts. The diagramed example, from a recent California tournament, was noted and analyzed by Michael Lawrence, one of the world's great player-writers. South landed in four spades as shown after East had opened with one heart and his partner had raised.</p>
        <p>When a heart was led, South put up dummy's queen and won with the ace when the king appeared. Perhaps he now regretted having played the queen, which would have protected him against further heart leads from East. His only hope was to find East with a doubleton trump king, but to take advantage of that possibility he needed an entry to the dummy. And that had to come from a club ruff.</p>
        <p>He led a low club, West made the normal play of the three, and East captured the 10 with his king. Hearts were continued, and South ruffed the third round and led the club eight. This did not fool West, who knew from the earlier club play that the declarer held the queen-jack. He put up the ace, but the defense was helpless. West tried to cash the diamond ace, but South ruffed. He ruffed a club, holding his breath, finessed the spade queen, and made his long-shot game.</p>
        <p>Lawrence spotted the winning defense. When the first club was led it was vital for West to take his ace, breaking the second-hand-low rule. Then hearts can be continued, and it will be East who wins the second club trick. A fourth round of hearts will then promote a trump trick for the defense and defeat the contract.</p>
        <p>Should West have solved this problem? Perhaps, but it was very difficult. He could reason that South would be unlikely to lead a low club from any holding that included the king. With a king-queen combination he would lead an honor, and otherwise he would no doubt lead something else.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that South's play of the heart queen at the first trick was by no means an error. If he had preserved the queen, West would have been tempted to win the first club trick to continue hearts, so defeating the game.</p>
