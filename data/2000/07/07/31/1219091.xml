        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan has vowed to disregard a vote by Reform Party leaders to remove his name from their presidential ballot because of how he collected voters' signatures in the nominating process.</p>
        <p>''We plan to ignore it,'' Bay Buchanan, chief strategist for her brother's campaign, said yesterday, responding to a unanimous vote taken on Saturday in Dallas by a group of party officers.</p>
        <p>''It is of no consequence to us, and we plan to stand very, very strongly against the handful of mean-spirited dissidents who have refused to recognize that at every single turn of the process, they have been whupped,'' Ms. Buchanan said, signaling that conflict within the party was likely to endure.</p>
        <p>The vote to disqualify Mr. Buchanan came just over a week before the start of the Reform nominating convention in Long Beach, Calif., on Aug. 9. This latest controversy almost ensures that the convention will unfold in an atmosphere of contention and uncertainty with two distinct camps fighting for control of the party and the $12.6 million in federal campaign money that will be available to the party's nominee.</p>
        <p>One side has lined up behind Mr. Buchanan, who bolted from the Republican Party last year to expand his right-wing conservative base as a Reform Party leader. The other is not so much aligned behind his only rival, John Hagelin, as it is united in its zeal to stop Mr. Buchanan from using a party founded eight years ago by Ross Perot as a platform for his own conservative agenda.</p>
        <p>The result has become something of a political train wreck for a party that once projected pride in offering a new approach to government and optimism in a belief that Reform Party members could change a system dominated by the two mainstream parties.</p>
        <p>This latest round of intrigue follows accusations that Mr. Buchanan defrauded the process of collecting signatures for his nomination by turning in names of people who would otherwise not be qualified to vote in the Reform primary. Unlike Democrats and Republicans, who choose their nominee through state primaries, the Reform Party counts votes cast during a five-week period by party members, by people who have requested a ballot or by people who have signed petitions for the current election year.</p>
        <p>To investigate accusations of impropriety by the Buchanan campaign that first came from Mr. Hagelin's supporters, the party's Presidential Nomination Committee appointed a subcommittee to audit names submitted by both campaigns, along with supporting material. The Hagelin campaign complied with requests for information; the Buchanan campaign refused, asserting that the mere appointment of such a subcommittee violated party rules.</p>
        <p>Without all the necessary paperwork, the committee adjourned without voting, leaving the matter to the three members of the full committee. With two other party leaders unexpectedly joining them on Friday in an ex officio capacity -- the acting chairman, Gerald R. Moan, and the treasurer, Tom McLaughlin, both Buchanan supporters -- the committee voted 3 to 2 against imposing sanctions on the Buchanan campaign.</p>
        <p>A day later, a group of party officers that was large enough for a quorum but that did not include Mr. Moan and Mr. McLaughlin met in Dallas, where they reversed the committee vote by saying Mr. Buchanan's failure to cooperate with the subcommittee was grounds for removing him from the primary.</p>
        <p>''The burden to prove the names are valid rests with the candidate,'' said Russell J. Verney, the original party chairman who no longer holds a leadership position but remains a leading force against Mr. Buchanan by virtue of his close association with Mr. Perot.</p>
        <p>''Therefore,'' Mr. Verney added, ''the candidate disqualified himself.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Buchanan denied that her brother's campaign did anything wrong, unethical or illegal. ''There was absolutely no fraud,'' she said. ''I dealt very closely with the nominating committee and followed its instructions to the letter. To come back now and say anything we did was flawed is a malicious and outrageous representation of the facts.''</p>
        <p>Both camps agree that the swirl of activity last week is by no means fatal to Mr. Buchanan's quest for the nomination and the federal campaign money. Ultimately, a vote by delegates at the convention may decide the nomination. By party rules, a two-thirds vote of delegates could suspend the primary process, after which the delegates would vote, with a simple majority determining the nominee.</p>
        <p>But it is not clear whether the Buchanan forces have the necessary delegate votes yet. A final count will not be possible before a meeting on Aug. 8, a day before the convention is to start, when forces for and against Mr. Buchanan are expected to fight over challenges to seat delegates that could affect hundreds of them, and set the tone for the days that follow.</p>
