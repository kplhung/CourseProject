        <p>SKIN cancer rates are rapidly increasing, and many aging baby boomers may discover that sun exposure in early childhood will lead to dangerous lesions as adults. Health care providers and the public have been taught in recent years to follow the A B C D rule -- to watch for and inspect skin spots that are Asymmetrical, have Border irregularities, Color variations and a Diameter greater than six millimeters.</p>
        <p>But those features are not always visible to the naked eye. Dr. Marek Elbaum, a New York physicist and engineer, says he thinks a computer with a light-and-vision system that he and a group of colleagues have patented will be much better at detecting melanoma in its earliest stages.</p>
        <p>''A clinician has to be trained in differentiating between malignancy patterns of tissue and benign patterns,'' said Dr. Elbaum, who is also president of Electro-Optical Sciences, in Irvington, N.Y. ''With melanoma,'' he said, ''that is very difficult indeed, so difficult that thousands of patients die because the melanoma is not detected early enough. And there is a huge overbiopsy rate because physicians try to play it safe.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Elbaum said four million people had high risk factors for melanoma and must have moles and other growths tested once or twice a year. Those patients, he said, would be better served by a computer system that doctors could use as an outpatient tool to determine whether a lesion is cancerous</p>
        <p>''Central to the computer vision system are ways of analyzing melanoma lesions, imaging them and then quantifying those images,'' Dr. Elbaum said.</p>
        <p>First, a sensor shines light from the visible, invisible and infrared spectrums onto a lesion. Light from these different wavelengths is reflected back from the skin. Ten images are taken of each lesion.</p>
        <p>Software based on a mathematical formula called wavelet maxima processes the data from those images to weed out irrelevant information. The software creates a score for each lesion, indicating the probability of cancer, Dr. Elbaum said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Elbaum's company is conducting clinical trials in hopes of winning approval for the device from the Food and Drug Administration. He wants to have a device on the market that can be used by specialists or even nonspecialists by the end of the year. Dr. Elbaum and his colleagues, Dina Gutkowicz-Krusin, of Princeton, N.J.; Michael Greenebaum of Brooklyn; Adam Jacobs of Glen Ridge, N.J.; and Alexandru Bogdan of New York City, won patent number 6,081,612.</p>
        <p>Lasers That Pinpoint Lethal Buried Objects</p>
        <p>Bell Laboratories was in the news last week with the announcement of the first so-called plastic laser -- one that could be less expensive and have a wider variety of uses than the metal semiconductor lasers commonly used in consumer electronics and commercial products.</p>
        <p>But two inventors from Mississippi recently received a patent more in keeping with the original, matter-piercing, science-fiction notion of lasers.</p>
        <p>When introduced in the 1950's, the laser -- shorthand for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation -- were popularly conceived as scorching rays of red light that could slice through sheer rock or solid steel. Yet nearly half a century later, the most common use of lasers is to read digitally stored media like compact disks, CD-ROM's or DVD's. And lasers have found their way into countless medical, engineering, computer and agricultural devices.</p>
        <p>But the one patented last week by James Sabatier and Kenneth Gilbert of Oxford, Miss., is intended to find potentially millions of land mines buried in war zones and former battlefields around the world.</p>
        <p>The patent covers a method of using lasers and sound signals to detect buried objects. The system is based on the fact that sound will reflect back from hard objects buried a few inches to a few feet under a porous surface like dirt. Sound signals bounce between such buried objects and the surface, and off the objects and into the air.</p>
        <p>The inventors say the vibrations generated by an object like a land mine are 3 to 20 times as strong as those coming out of empty soil. A laser is used to detect those vibrations from a distance, and to reveal the location of the buried object.</p>
        <p>First, a beam of laser light from a sensor called a laser-Doppler vibrometer is scanned over the ground. The seismic vibrations cause upper-  and lower-side band signals to form in the laser's frequency, and those signals increase in strength when the laser passes over a hard, buried object. Laser light is scattered back to the sensor, where the frequencies are separated and analyzed to pinpoint the buried object's location.</p>
        <p>''The presence of a buried object, such as a mine, is detected by the increase in the amplitude of the side bands,'' the inventors write in their patent. They say their device can be mounted on a tower or an airplane, so wide areas can be surveyed. Mr. Sabatier and Mr. Gilbert received patent 6,081,481.</p>
        <p>Lasers That May Add New Twist to Bowling</p>
        <p>Patrick Ciniello says that lasers will help bowling compete with interactive electronic and computer games. He has patented a method of using lasers projected across a bowling lane to increase the number of points a player can win for a strike or a spare, and to make the speed and timing of a rolling ball a factor.</p>
        <p>The object is to win additional points by timing the roll of the ball so that it keeps pace with moving spots of laser light. The spots, from a laser suspended from the bowling alley ceiling, are beamed across the lane in a sequence as the ball rolls toward the pins.</p>
        <p>A sensor along the side of the lane detects the ball as it moves, and bowler wins the extra points if his ball passes that spot at the same time the laser lights hit it. Various spots along the lane are given extra points to add to the traditional strike or spare score.</p>
        <p>The timing of the lights can be varied depending on the skill of the bowler, so better ones might be challenged by faster light sequences, for example.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ciniello, who lives in Bonita Springs, Fla., won patent number 6,077,167.</p>
