        <p>President Clinton said today that the Republican majority in the Senate was purposely slowing action on his nominees to federal appeals courts and in some cases blocking people solely because they are black or Hispanic.</p>
        <p>Speaking to trial lawyers who are holding a convention here, Mr. Clinton compared what he said was the Republicans' refusal to consider some minority nominees for judicial posts to the 1986 vote in Congress  when Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, and other conservatives voted against a resolution asking, among other things, that Nelson Mandela be released from jail in South Africa.</p>

        <p>President Clinton said today that the Republican majority in the Senate was purposely slowing action on his nominees to federal appeals courts and in some cases blocking people solely because they are black or Hispanic.</p>
        <p>Speaking to trial lawyers who are holding a convention here, Mr. Clinton compared what he said was the Republicans' refusal to consider some minority nominees for judicial posts to the 1986 vote in Congress  when Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, and other conservatives voted against a resolution asking, among other things, that Nelson Mandela be released from jail in South Africa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said Mr. Cheney's vote on the Mandela resolution was so amazing, ''it takes your breath away.''</p>
        <p>But he said Mr. Mandela had managed to get out of jail and help transform South Africa despite that vote.</p>
        <p>''I'm worried about the people now whom I've tried to put on the court of appeals who are African-American and Hispanic who are being held in political jail because they can't get a hearing from this Republican Senate,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>In complaining about the refusal of the Senate Judiciary Committee to schedule a hearing on a Hispanic judge from Texas, Mr. Clinton also managed to criticize Gov. George W. Bush for not supporting the nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The president said Republican senators had also refused to consider two black nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. Although the circuit has the most black residents of the nation's 11 regional appeals courts, it has never had a black judge, Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>As often happens in presidential election years, the party that controls the Senate but not the White House, in this case the Republicans, slows the confirmation process hoping to preserve judicial slots that carry lifetime tenure for their own candidates.</p>
        <p>In appearing before the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the first president to do so since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Mr. Clinton paid tribute to a group that has been one of the Democratic Party's most reliable sources of campaign donations in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who has been the party's principal fund-raiser in recent years, will leave office in January and told an audience yesterday in New York that he would never run for office again.</p>
        <p>His appearance before the annual convention of trial lawyers was not only about gratitude for the recent past but also about the importance of the trial lawyers in the current election.</p>
        <p>So far this year, campaign contribution figures showed that donations from trial lawyers to Democratic candidates have served as a counterforce to the corporate donations that go largely to Republicans, producing a kind of complicated financial ecosystem.</p>
        <p>In this election cycle, law firms have donated more than $57 million, said Sheila Krumholz, the research director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. Of that, more than $38 million went to Democrats with less than $19 million to Republicans.</p>
        <p>''The trial lawyers are somewhat critical to Gore,'' Ms. Krumholz said.</p>
        <p>Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, a group that monitors campaign spending, said the money from trial lawyers had brought some balance to the enormous battle in state legislatures and Congress over the issue of limiting lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''You're having fundamental values being played out here and the trial lawyers are only trying to level the playing field,'' Mr. Harshbarger, a former attorney general of Massachusetts, said in an interview. And there is perhaps no more stark difference between the presidential candidates than on the issue of so-called civil justice reform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has made attacks on trial lawyers a centerpiece of his campaign and has vowed that if elected, he would push a program similar to the one he helped enact in Texas. He has pointed with pride to his record in Texas of curbing civil litigation, capping legal fees and limiting jury awards.</p>
        <p>Mary Alexander, a San Francisco trial lawyer who is the vice-president-designate of the trial lawyers' association, said today that Vice President Al Gore, on the other hand, had been a reliable supporter of the effort by trial lawyers to maintain the right to sue corporations as a counterweight to corporate power.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Gore is someone who believes in consumers, someone who believes they should have their day in court,'' Ms. Alexander said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Gore did not address the convention and has seemingly resisted emphasizing the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harshbarger said that corporations have been successful in their effort to ''paint lawyers as the bad guys.'' He said it was not surprising that Mr. Gore had tried to keep some distance between himself and the lawyers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's appearance at the convention is, in a sense, as a surrogate for Mr. Gore and, to a lesser extent, for other Democrats, notably Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the United States Senate from New York.</p>
        <p>Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer advocate who has been closely allied with trial lawyers on the issue of civil litigation rules, said Mr. Gore was allowing the president to take the heat of associating with the lawyers while he was reaping the benefits.</p>
        <p>''He's just slinking around taking money like crazy from these guys, and at the same time he's not really standing up for the civil justice system,'' Mr. Nader, a candidate for president from the Green Party, said.</p>
        <p>He cited as an example, that Mr. Gore did not respond to a speech in  February in which Mr. Bush told a South Carolina audience of business people that Mr. Bush would immediately seek changes in litigation rules if elected.</p>
