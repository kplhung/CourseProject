        <p>In hindsight, success tends to look easy, even predictable. That's as true in business as it is in sports, politics or other fields. Yet things often look decidedly more unnerving from the vantage point of the executive on the firing line.</p>
        <p>In a lengthy interview last week, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., talked mostly about a management reorganization that the company announced on Monday. But Mr. Gerstner, who is often portrayed as blunt, gruff and seemingly arrogant, also candidly described his early, uncertain days at I.B.M. -- when he arrived as an outsider suddenly in charge of a corporation that was both an American icon and in deep trouble.</p>
        <p>After he took over in 1993, Mr. Gerstner ran the company for more than a year in a style he called ''survival mode.''</p>
        <p>''We had to cut $9 billion a year in expenses. We had to bring the company back, literally, from the brink of death. We had to deal with cultural and personal tragedies that resulted. And we had to reassert that we were for real in the marketplace. That was a very centralized, personalized leadership and organizational style. It was focused on the short term, and it was very intuitive.''</p>
        <p>''So it was a benevolent dictatorship,'' he continued, ''with me as the dictator and hoping -- just hoping -- that I was getting some good advice from my colleagues who knew a heck of a lot more about I.B.M. and this industry than I would ever know.''</p>
