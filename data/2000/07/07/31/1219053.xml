        <p>DEALINGS between agencies and advertisers are improving after two years of strained relations, according to an annual survey. But difficulties remain in some important areas.</p>
        <p>The results of the survey, which asked executives at agencies and client companies to evaluate their working relationships, show that tensions have eased, thanks to efforts to bridge the gap between the two sides. ''We're seeing a lot of steps in the right direction,'' said Nancy L. Salz, president at Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview of the 2000 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Salz, who has sponsored the survey annually since 1986, said she was most pleased by this finding: When agency executives were asked for what percentage of their clients were they able to do their ''best advertising,'' the mean percentage was 65.4 -- the highest figure ever in that category. ''We hypothesize that this is related to a renewed appreciation for advertising'' among marketers, Ms. Salz said, generated by the recent spate of extensive campaigns for dot-coms, which ''allowed agencies to feel they were doing better, more creative work.''</p>
        <p>''Even though there are a lot of opinions that such advertising was not as strong as it should have been in building brands rather than just name awareness,'' she added, ''for better or worse dot-com advertising has created an increased focus on advertising'' and ''how it must be used to work most effectively.''</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, the 2000 survey sought to determine for the first time whether there were differences in the relationships marketers have with interactive and traditional agencies. The advertisers responding to the survey said there was more tension in their dealings with interactive shops and more focus on money; in addition, they said they provided more strategic direction to their interactive agencies.</p>
        <p>The agency executives, for their part, said working with dot-com clients was more tense and time pressured but offered more teamwork.</p>
        <p>The results of the Salz Consulting survey have seesawed in recent years. In 1996 and 1997, there were strong suggestions of improved relationships, followed by widespread signs of setbacks in 1998 and 1999.</p>
        <p>In working together to create campaigns to turn consumers into customers, ''the agency people are often very focused on using creativity to get attention,'' Ms. Salz said, ''while the advertisers are very focused on hammering home the benefits, making sure the strategic message comes through.'' The resulting tensions are manifested in divergent answers to survey questions.</p>
        <p>For instance, when asked if there has been more teamwork in relationships in the last year, 54 percent of the advertisers responding to the survey said yes, compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.</p>
        <p>When asked if they agreed that there was more focus on money in the last year, 54 percent of the agency executives said yes, compared with 32 percent of the advertisers.</p>
        <p>And when asked if there was more or less focus on how they work with each other, 57 percent of the advertisers said ''more,'' compared with 38 percent of the agency executives.</p>
        <p>Still, there were several indications of better relations. When asked if there were more or fewer hassles -- dude, that's the way the question was worded -- in their dealings with each other, only 12 percent of the agency executives said ''more,'' while 12 percent said ''fewer'' and 73 percent said they saw no change. The results were similar among advertisers as 23 percent said there were more hassles, 20 percent said there were fewer and 57 percent said they saw no change.</p>
        <p>When asked to rate the quality of work from their agencies on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 highest, the mean rating from advertisers was 7.2, an increase from 7.0 in 1999.</p>
        <p>Tellingly, advertisers that compensate their agencies based on performance criteria like sales rather than conventional commission or fee methods ranked the quality of their advertising higher, a mean rating of 7.5 compared with 7.0 for those who use conventional methods. That was the first time advertising created under performance-based compensation plans was deemed superior.</p>
        <p>And after three years of declines, advertisers indicated that advertising was becoming more important to them. When asked how much sales could improve if their agencies were always able to do the best possible work, the mean figure the respondents gave was 26.1 percent. By comparison, last year the mean figure was 21.4 percent, the lowest response since the recession year of 1991.</p>
        <p>Speaking of economic conditions, Ms. Salz was asked if the record boom in ad spending as the American economic expansion enters its 10th year was serving as a lubricant to reduce friction between advertisers and agencies.</p>
        <p>''We're all very happy when budgets are increasing and advertising is driving sales, but I don't think it's the budgets that have affected what the agencies are feeling,'' Ms. Salz replied. ''It's more about the work they're producing.''</p>
        <p>The survey was conducted in April and May for Salz Consulting by Thurm Marketing and Consulting in Princeton, N.J. Salz Consulting sponsors training seminars in agency relations and advertising development for marketers like American Express, Clorox and Compaq.</p>
