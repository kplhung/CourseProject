        <p>The biggest cheers and the deepest sigh of relief in the Jets' preseason victory over New Orleans on Saturday night were reserved for quarterback Vinny Testaverde.</p>
        <p>But the goose bumps belonged to Vaughn Sanders.</p>
        <p>''I opened my own eyes,'' Sanders said.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's successful return to live action with his surgically repaired Achilles' tendon was the most critical development for the Jets' fortunes. But it was Sanders's debut -- he, too, is recovering from a devastating injury -- that cast a warm glow on what was otherwise the antiseptic feel of exhibition football at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''The happy story, the feel-good story, was Vaughn Sanders running the ball,'' Coach Al Groh said. ''I'm very happy for him. He has a toughness and heart we want to be part of all our players.''</p>
        <p>Sanders, the rookie free agent running back from Hofstra, was the Jets' leading rusher Saturday, gaining 61 yards on 13 attempts and scoring a touchdown, the game-winner. He also caught 4 passes for 13 yards.</p>
        <p>The crowds at Lawrence High School in Cedarhurst on Long Island, where Sanders played scholastically, could not compare to those at Hofstra. And the football stadium at Hofstra could fit neatly into Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>And so Sanders, whose college career ended when he broke his left leg and tore ligaments in his ankle during the fifth game of Hofstra's 1999 season, embraced the moment like a Little Leaguer skipping around the bases after his first home run. When Sanders scored on a 1-yard run with 1 minute 17 seconds left, capping a 77-yard drive in which he ran for 30 yards and caught a pass for 3 yards, he spiked the ball and then practically levitated on his way back to the sideline.</p>
        <p>''It's everything you dream about from when you're a little kid, since you start playing football,'' Sanders said, his words running together in an ebullient stream. ''You dream about scoring a touchdown in front of the crowd, playing in your hometown. I can't even describe how excited I was. I was beat from celebrating more than from running the touchdown in. It was a great feeling for me. Coach Groh said he wanted players who play hard and love the game of football, and that fits me perfectly. I can't fake this. When I score a touchdown or a make a big play, I'm just excited about it.''</p>
        <p>Sanders is still more likely to make the Jets' roster -- if he makes it at all -- as a special-teams player, not as a running back. He showed power running straight up the middle but got jammed several times before turning the corner when he tried to go outside. But certainly, Saturday's performance raised his profile, though he had already caught the eye of Curtis Martin.</p>
        <p>''Curtis and Richie Anderson brought me in like I was a little brother,'' Sanders said. ''They gave me pointers, and I love them for it. I thank them for it every day. They told me things that will make me better in my future. Curtis is a great person. He said, 'Here's an opportunity for you to take it and run.' I listened to him.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, there was another free agent from Hofstra, a long shot to make the team. Wayne Chrebet is now the Jets' No. 1 receiver. Sanders went a long way Saturday toward repeating that feat.</p>
        <p>''It must be something in the water,'' Sanders said.</p>
        <p>Special Teams</p>
        <p>Dave Meggett, the former Giant and Jet and the N.F.L.'s leading career punt returner, will tutor the Jets' kick returners today and tomorrow. Coach Al Groh said he is committed to giving Windrell Hayes more chances as a punt returner despite Hayes's difficult night in which he muffed a punt return in the third quarter that led to a Saints touchdown. His three return opportunities went for a total of 6 yards. . . . Groh emphasized yesterday that although the Jets had an edge in offensive yardage of 191 yards, they won by only 4 points because the Saints had to drive a total of just 22 yards for all of their scores. The Saints returned an interception and a punt for a touchdown and got the ball on the Jets' 22-yard line after Hayes's muffed punt return.</p>
        <p>Held Back</p>
        <p>Running back Bernie Parmalee was held out of the game to give him a rest and because his role is set. Receiver Yatil Green, who played but did not catch a pass, was omitted from the game plan because the Jets had to pare how many receivers got passes to evaluate them, Coach Al Groh said. . . . Groh declined to comment on quarterback Ray Lucas's thinly veiled criticism of how the team treated him during the off-season. . . . Running back Robert Farmer, in a battle to make the squad, got an earful from Groh after he fumbled his second handoff of the night. ''It's not the most positive evening that a player in that circumstance can have,'' Groh said. . . . With defensive end Eric Ogbogu still out with shoulder problems, Shane Burton got the edge in the battle for the right end job, although Groh said the race with Anthony Cook is still close.</p>
        <p>A Slow-Starting Rush</p>
        <p>The pass rush got going a bit late, but ended up recording five sacks, one each by John Abraham, Rick Lyle, Tony Scott, Dorian Boose and Shaun Ellis. Boose, who is battling for a spot, also forced a fumble. Abraham drew special praise from Al Groh. He was credited with three tackles, had one sack and a forced fumble. For part of the evening, he was lined up against Saints tackle Willie Roaf, who was named to the all-decade team last week. . . . Scott Frost, who is battling for the free safety job, had an interception.</p>
