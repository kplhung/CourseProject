        <p>Phone Workers Threaten A Strike Against Verizon  In what would be one of the biggest strikes in a decade, 85,000 telephone workers on the East Coast are threatening to walk out next weekend in a struggle that pits old-line labor against the New Economy.</p>
        <p>The workers are facing off with Verizon Communications -- the name that Bell Atlantic adopted last month after acquiring GTE -- in large part because they fear the company's widespread use of lower paid, nonunion workers in its fastest growing businesses, most notably wireless phones, will endanger the wages and benefits of unionized workers.

        <p>Auto Parts Industry Fights Back  After several big auto insurers stopped requiring body shops to use lower-priced generic car parts because of lawsuits, sales in the $1.5 billion business plunged by 30 percent. Now, the generic parts industry is fighting back, starting with a lawsuit in California. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Good earnings reports for some of the biggest names in commercial insurance suggested that long-depressed prices for coverage were beginning to rise, and investors lifted the shares of several big insurers. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Report on Organic Food Challenged  A report by the ABC correspondent John Stossel on ''20/20'' in February cited research that showed organic food seemed more likely than conventional food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He also said that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce. But the researchers who were hired to do the testing said they never tested for pesticide residue. And ABC executives are looking into whether the statement about produce was made without any basis in fact. [C11.]</p>
        <p>A Glimpse of the Graphic Future  At the Siggraph convention, the most important annual gathering for computer graphics and interactive technologies, the biggest names in the industry and many start-up companies introduce their newest products.

        <p>Lack of Data in Deal for Seagram  Since Vivendi announced that it was buying Seagram for $34 billion, many analysts are still trying to figure out what Vivendi is up to with Seagram. And their puzzlement has made them reluctant to offer investors guidance, which has translated into a listless Seagram share price. Market Place. [C12.]</p>

        <p>Gerstner on Early Days at I.B.M.  In a long interview, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., candidly described his early, uncertain days at the company -- when he arrived as an outsider suddenly in charge of a corporation that was both an American icon and in deep trouble. Mr. Gerstner, who took over in 1993, ran the company for more than a year in a style he called ''survival mode'' as a benevolent dictator. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Dot-Com Recruiting Woes: Part 2  For dot-com companies, the number of available workers has grown, but as employees jump off sinking ships or swim away from ones already capsized, they are being much more selective about where they dock next. Instead of stock options and promises of revolution, employees now want two things from prospective employers: a good salary and good prospects for corporate longevity.
