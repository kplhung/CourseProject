        <p>The majority of delegates assembling here today to nominate Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president are notably conservative in thought and spirit, even at a time when Mr. Bush has sought to portray the Republican Party as increasingly moderate, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of delegates.</p>
        <p>On a host of important issues, from affirmative action to environmental concerns to abortion, the poll found that delegates stand significantly to the right of much of the nation and even to the right of rank-and-file Republican voters.</p>
        <p>In fact, a majority of the 2,066 delegates described themselves as somewhat or very conservative, and their views on a variety of topics reflected that.</p>
        <p>The delegates by and large supported large tax cuts and school vouchers, and opposed gun control, curbs on trade, environmental safeguards, abortion rights, prescription drug subsidies for the elderly and campaign finance regulation.</p>
        <p>In one notable example of the contrast between the delegates and Republican voters, The Times/CBS poll found that fewer than half the delegates said they supported mandatory child safety locks on firearms, a measure that was supported by 8 of 10 registered Republican voters.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush has sought for much of this year to distinguish himself from his party's conservative wing and history, most delegates interviewed today considered him conservative, if not necessarily as conservative as they considered themselves.</p>
        <p>They are also, overwhelmingly, enthusiastic about the qualifications and political skills of the man they will nominate for president on Thursday night, and confident about his chances against Vice President Al Gore in November.</p>
        <p>''The party has a conservative wing and a moderate wing and both sides are comfortable with him,'' Eric Melgren, a delegate from Kansas, said of Mr. Bush. ''Republicans are hungry enough that there is, to at least some degree, things that are all willing to overlook.''</p>
        <p>The finding in The Times/CBS poll, as well as in follow-up interviews conducted today with delegates, suggested one of the tasks Mr. Bush faces this week: Convincing independents and moderate Democrats, in particular, that his is the face of the Republican Party, rather than of the delegates who will be celebrating his nomination.</p>
        <p>The poll of the delegates was conducted by The New York Times and CBS News by telephone, mail, fax, e-mail messages and over the Internet from June 26 through July 28. Of the 2,066 Republican delegates, 1,055 responded to the questionnaire. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.</p>
        <p>The delegates who began arriving here this weekend are, the poll found, overwhelmingly white -- almost 90 percent -- and mostly male and middle age. By profession, they are more likely to be lawyers and business executives than teachers or farmers. They are relatively wealthy: one in five put their net worth as $1 million or more.</p>
        <p>Nearly one in five said they belonged to the National Rifle Association, and over half said they or someone in their house owned a gun.</p>
        <p>For much of this campaign, Mr. Bush has sought to draw some distance between himself and conservatives in the party -- and, it seems, he has paid little price for that among the Republicans here.</p>
        <p>In contrast to surveys of rank-and-file Republican voters, the poll of the delegates found that they were more apt to describe Mr. Bush as conservative. In a tribute to his political skills, delegates who described themselves as moderates viewed him as one, too, while self-described conservatives called him conservative.</p>
        <p>Georgia Buxton, a delegate from Maine who described herself as moderate, offered this description of Mr. Bush: ''I see him as a moderate with some conservative areas.''</p>
        <p>But another delegate from Maine, Elaine Bridge, who described herself as conservative, challenged the description almost as soon as it left Mrs. Buxton's mouth this afternoon.</p>
        <p>''I think he's a conservative,'' Ms. Bridge said. ''More so than his dad.''</p>
        <p>As a rule, people who attend political conventions tend to be more informed and more partisan, and past polls have noted similar differences in views between the delegates and the public.</p>
        <p>Still, this year's poll suggested a wide disparity between voters and delegates at a time when Mr. Bush has been trying to pull the party to the center as Republicans seek to win the White House for the first time since 1988.</p>
        <p>''We're a conservative party,'' Mike Davis, an alternate delegate from South Carolina, said this afternoon as he sat on a bench outside Independence Hall. ''We want lower taxes. Less government.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to the prevailing national sentiment found in other polls, the delegates supported using the nation's budget surplus to cut taxes, rather than assure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>They overwhelmingly opposed a ban on the largely unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money. They also opposed a proposed plan to help make prescription  drugs more affordable to the elderly by having the federal government pay subsidies to insurance companies.</p>
        <p>Four out of 10 delegates said they believed the federal government was doing too much when it came to regulating the environment and the safety practices of business.</p>
        <p>And the delegates were also more likely to support the death penalty, and oppose life in prison without parole, as an appropriate punishment for murderers.</p>
        <p>Nearly 80 percent of the delegates said their views on the death penalty had not been changed by recent reports of people being convicted for murder who are later found to be innocent.</p>
        <p>Although the delegates were overwhelmingly opposed to abortion rights, only 2 in 10 said that Mr. Bush would consider the issue when choosing judges for nomination to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Jan Howard, 48, a delegate from California, said that Mr. Bush's views of government closely hewed to her own.</p>
        <p>''He believes in less government and more individual responsibility,'' Ms. Howard said. ''He probably leans toward the conservative side, but he's accepting of people and he doesn't focus on areas where we disagree.''</p>
        <p>''Bush sees a lot of potential and wants to keep government out of the way,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Finally, reflecting the spirit of the occasion, the delegates viewed Mr.  Bush's candidacy with enthusiasm -- indeed, with more enthusiasm than had been voiced by registered Republicans.</p>
        <p>Forty-two percent of Mr. Bush's supporters across the nation said they supported him with reservations. Only four percent of the delegates said they felt the same way.</p>
