        <p>Bobby J. Jones's final pitch of the game looked so tantalizing, leaving his sweaty fingers and floating to the plate as if it were a Frisbee. Fernando Tatis might as well have been a character in a Bugs Bunny cartoon since he could have waved his bat once and then twice as he waited for the ball.</p>
        <p>Eventually it reached him, and Tatis swung mightily and missed. The pitch was a curveball, and the scoreboard said it had traveled 65 miles an hour. Some fans were going to drive home faster than that. Some Little Leaguers throw pitches that are harder than that.</p>
        <p>But Jones is that kind of baffling pitcher, someone who can toy with hitters when he is at his most effective. Jones, who had a stint in the minor leagues last month, tossed a complete game, and Bubba Trammell did a splendid imitation of Mike Bordick by smashing a three-run homer in his first at-bat with the Mets to guide them past the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-2, yesterday at Shea Stadium for their sixth straight victory.</p>
        <p>Jones struck out nine, including Jim Edmonds three times, walked one and gave up four hits.</p>
        <p>It was the Mets' second three-game sweep of the Cardinals in nine weeks, it gave them a 6-0 record on their homestand and it came on the day they honored their past by announcing the 10 greatest moments in team history.</p>
        <p>So, with Tom Seaver, Willie Mays, Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and about 30 other former Mets at Shea, Jones created his own special moment with his first complete game since 1997.</p>
        <p>Trammell did the same by going deep and hearing New Yorkers chant: ''Bub-ba! Bub-ba!'' for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Sure, it's special,'' Jones said. ''I'm just glad I showed them the good Bobby Jones and not the early on, struggling Bobby Jones.''</p>
        <p>Trammell, who played right field while Derek Bell rested, joined the party a day later than Bordick and Rick White and earned the first curtain call of his Mets career in the second.</p>
        <p>Garrett Stephenson tried to pump an 0-2 fastball past him. and Trammell bashed it to left field, easing the nerves that had plagued him so much before the game that he avoided talking to any former Mets.</p>
        <p>''I was in awe of being on the same field as those guys,'' Trammell said. ''If I could have half the career of what they had, that would be outstanding.''</p>
        <p>Jones's career seemed to be on life support when the Mets asked him to go to Class AAA Norfolk on June 13 because he was 1-3 with a 10.19 earned run average. Jones accepted the demotion, scrapped a new delivery he was working on and has been a more aggressive pitcher since his 10 days in the minors, going 4-2 with a 3.03 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>His record now stands at 5-5, with a 5.76 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>''I showed up at the park when I was struggling knowing that I was a lot better than I had shown this season,'' said Jones, who pitched his first complete game since May 1997.</p>
        <p>Still, Jones had to prove it, and he did that yesterday by retiring the first 14 batters he faced. The Mets have never had one of their pitchers throw a no-hitter, and it would have been appropriate if Jones had done so on their greatest moments day. Would they have immediately tossed it into the top 10?</p>
        <p>It proved irrelevant because Tatis laced a single to left with two outs in the fifth, and a walk and Jones's error allowed the Cardinals to load the bases. The Mets had a 4-0 lead and Jones still felt relaxed, which showed when he struck out pinch-hitter Thomas Howard with a 1-2 fastball.</p>
        <p>''The good thing is he's doing it when we need it most,'' Mike Piazza said.</p>
        <p>And he does it with breaking pitches and precise location, elements that make his 85-mile-an-hour fastball seem as if it is at least 90.</p>
        <p>''That's what I do,'' Jones said. ''That's what I'm trying to do.''</p>
        <p>With the trade deadline looming at 4 p.m. today, it is unlikely that the Mets will add another starter. General Manager Steve Phillips pushed hard to acquire Curt Schilling, who would have bounced Glendon Rusch or Jones out of the rotation. Since Jones is no longer a wayward sort, the Mets have confidence in a rotation that is 5-1 with a 2.61 E.R.A. in the last 10 games.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure Bobby Jones is who we were trying to deal or upgrade, but I'm very confident with him,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He can pitch, man.''</p>
        <p>Benny Agbayani led off the first with a homer off Stephenson (11-7), but it was quickly overshadowed by what happened in the bottom of the second. With runners on first and second, Trammell became the seventh Met to homer in his first at-bat in the team's 39-year history and the second in two days.</p>
        <p>After Trammell rounded the bases, he gave high-fives to everyone in the dugout except Bordick. The two new players, owners of homers in their first at-bats with the Mets only 24 hours apart, hugged.</p>
        <p>''We knew what each other was thinking,'' Trammell said.</p>
        <p>When Valentine was asked the odds of what Bordick and Trammell had achieved, he said: ''Kind of like getting in early on an I.P.O. Immediate returns. It's great.''</p>
        <p>With a 4-0 lead, Jones avoided a speed bump in the fifth, gave up one run in the sixth and then stifled the Cardinals until Ray Lankford homered with two outs in the ninth. That merely gave him the chance to mesmerize Tatis one final time. Jones threw the fluttering 65-m.p.h. curveball, Tatis missed it and the Mets had one more important moment in this evolving season.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long time,'' Jones said, ''since I got the last out in a game.''</p>
