        <p>With the words of the Old Testament to guide them, Jewish settlers on the West Bank have never been much concerned about their image in the world, nor even, for the most part, about how their hard-line ways and beliefs are viewed by their fellow Israelis.</p>
        <p>Avoiding provocation of their adversaries -- whether Palestinians, fellow Jews or American peacemakers -- has rarely been their way.</p>
        <p>So when Avi Dobuler strapped his pistol on his waist today and led a family of American tourists to the marble-topped grave of Dr. Baruch Goldstein, the settler who massacred 29 Palestinians in a hail of rifle fire in one of Islam's holiest places of prayer in February 1994 and who was then shot to death himself, Mr. Dobuler was not inclined to be diplomatic.</p>
        <p>To him, and to many of the 200,000 settlers on the West Bank, it has mattered little that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are moving ever closer to decisions on the settlements' future.</p>
        <p>Although the negotiations faltered last week at Camp David, the issue that caused the impasse was not so much the settlements as the future Palestinian role in Jerusalem, about 25 miles north of here.</p>
        <p>On the settlements, according to Israeli, Palestinian and American versions of the discussions, the two sides moved closer than ever to agreement, and part of that consensus was that the 7,000 Jews living in and around Hebron, the most explosive of all the West Bank hot spots, will be among about 40,000 settlers who will have to live under Palestinian rule in any final peace pact.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobuler, now 45, came to Israel in 1970 from his home in New York and now lives in Beit El, a settlement near the West Bank city of Ramallah that may also be marked for eventual Palestinian rule. To him the news from Camp David seemed like a good text for a homily -- at the grave of Dr. Goldstein, whom he called a good man and a friend -- on ''a make-believe peace process.''</p>
        <p>The grave and its graveled surroundings, carefully tended by the settlers, have become a shrine since the massacre by Dr. Goldstein in a mosque at the Tomb of the Patriarchs, a sacred place for Jews and Muslims that lies close by the settlement of Qiryat Arba where Dr. Goldstein lived and lies buried.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobuler, like many of the settlers, rejects the official Israeli finding that Dr. Goldstein was ''solely responsible'' for the massacre and depicts him as the victim of a government frame-up intended to isolate the settlers.</p>
        <p>''People say we've no right to be here, but the purchase of this land by Abraham nearly 4,000 years ago is in the Bible,'' Mr. Dobuler said, raising the carefully annotated Old Testament he carries on his guided tours.</p>
        <p>To the family of David and Nonie Vonnegut-Gabovitch from Indianapolis, touring Israel with their four children, Mr. Dobuler's exculpation of Dr. Goldstein seemed deeply disturbing. ''Had I known that the grave was on the itinerary beforehand, I would have said no,'' said Mr. Vonnegut-Gabovitch, 41, a real estate agent.</p>
        <p>Still, the occasion served as a powerful illustration of the complex and darkening world in which the settlers in places like Qiryat Arba live as the moment nears when they will have to choose whether to stay on under eventual Palestinian rule or accept whatever compensation a final peace agreement offers for a return inside the sovereign borders of Israel.</p>
        <p>It is a world that is easy for outsiders, including other Israelis, to disparage, but it is also one that at first hand lends a powerful element of poignancy to the settlers' plight.</p>
        <p>In a day spent touring Qiryat Arba, on heights to the east of Hebron, and the three tiny Jewish communities that live a beleaguered existence inside the town itself, the complaint most frequently heard from the settlers was that outsiders, particularly journalists, represent them as extremists out of touch with reality.</p>
        <p>''Why is it that people always represent us as some kind of loonies?'' said David Wilder, the spokesman for the Association for the Renewal of the Jewish Community in Hebron.</p>
        <p>''Believe me, I'm not crazy, and neither are any of the settlers living here,'' said Mr. Wilder, 46, a migrant from New Jersey. ''We are living an ideal. We are not criminals or killers. We came here to re-establish a Jewish community that existed in Hebron for 2,000 years, and we did so in the face of enormous hostility from our Palestinian neighbors, and that's no more crazy than somebody who takes the subway in New York at 11:30 at night.''</p>
        <p>The other side of the settlers' story, as set out by Mr. Wilder and a dozen other settlers, is one of courage in pursuit of a biblical vision, of moving into the unpromising terrain made accessible by Israeli conquests in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, of building communities from scratch, of nurturing large families and deep attachments to neighbors.</p>
        <p>Now, in Hebron and perhaps 20 or 30 other settlements that seem likely to become part of an eventual Palestinian state, the settlers sense that an Israel that once saw them as pioneers rejects them as liabilities.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the Camp David talks last week, members of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government took few pains to disguise their readiness to abandon settlements like Qiryat Arba.</p>
        <p>Details of the maps put forward, and what they would mean for the settlements, appeared on the front pages of Israeli newspapers, and sympathy for the settlers was scant.</p>
        <p>''The settlements are towns of Israelis and not Israeli towns,'' Justice Minister Yossi Beilin told the newspaper Maariv.</p>
        <p>He added, ''The option that 20 percent of the settlers are going to have in the end is either to stay there under full Palestinian sovereignty or accept compensation and leave.''</p>
        <p>To the settlers' argument that previous Israeli governments encouraged them, Mr. Beilin replied, ''We aren't dealing with historic justice at present.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak faces chronic political problems in winning acceptance for a peace pact, even if his shaky coalition survives a parliamentary vote on Monday on a motion of no confidence in his government. He is calculating that the settlements saved would weigh decisively with Israeli opinion, against those that would be lost.</p>
        <p>But to many Israelis, even those who favor the Camp David proposals, the attempt to anchor settlements that would remain part of Israel -- perhaps 120 of the 145 settlements, according to Camp David negotiators -- has a distinctly chimerical, not to mention expensive, touch.</p>
        <p>Most of the settlements are armed encampments on the rocky hillsides, often close by or even inside the West Bank towns and villages where more than a million Palestinians live.</p>
        <p>The Israeli settlements would be linked, as now, to the rest of the country by a spaghetti of so-called security roads patrolled by Israeli troops, with each settlement likewise provided with its own defense units, as well as secure supplies of water and electricity.</p>
        <p>Jobs, higher education and even limited recreation would involve a commute to cities like Jerusalem, through potentially hostile territory.</p>
        <p>In Qiryat Arba and the Jewish communities in Hebron, opinions differed as to whether staying on under Palestinian rule would be possible.</p>
        <p>A 16-year-old high school student, Lital Danon, pausing to eat an ice-cream at Elitzur's, a combined bakery and soda fountain that is a favorite Qiryat Arba meeting spot, hailed an approaching stranger.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to Zion!'' she said. But when asked about the Barak plan to hand over Qiryat Arba to a Palestinian state, she replied briskly: ''It's ugly. It would be impossible to live with Arabs. But it's also not so easy to find a place to flee to.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dobuler, leading his tour, offered an apocalyptic vision. ''To stay here would be a death sentence, because the Palestinians would pick us off one by one,'' he said. Mr. Wilder, in his role as the settlers' spokesman, concurred on the risks but said most settlers would remain, trying to guard against Palestinian threats.</p>
        <p>Israeli paratroopers patrolling Qiryat Arba, within earshot of the settlers, endorsed the settlers' sense of biblical purpose. But as soon as the settlers moved away, young conscripts from cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reverted to the more common view among Israelis: that the settlers have been living an unsustainable dream.</p>
        <p>''Of course they'll have to go,'' said a 21-year-old sergeant who gave his name as Oren. A companion chipped in: ''There's no religious significance here. They are Jews like us, and they can live in Israel.''</p>
        <p>In Hebron the prospects of the settlements surviving a peace agreement seemed still more improbable. The 600 Jews living in the city, surrounded by at least 150,000 Palestinians, rely for protection on SWAT teams of Israeli police and jeeploads of soldiers on 24-hour patrols -- together with the men deployed around Qiryat Arba, an armed force of about 2,500, according to published Israeli accounts.</p>
        <p>On one short street divided between Jews and Palestinians, the Jewish homes are protected against the stones and firebombs that have been a frequent menace by a 60-foot-high, street-wide fence.</p>
        <p>Mention of Mr. Barak invites torrents of vituperation. ''He's a traitor through and through,'' said one old woman tending to a flower box on the windowsill of her home, who declined to give her name. ''Barak thinks he can play God, but he is not God, and God will punish him.''</p>
        <p>A block away, in the teeming Kazazeen bazaar, Palestinians waved away talk of the Jewish settlements coming under Palestinian rule, saying they had little faith that that could ever come about.</p>
        <p>''The Jews have treated us like donkeys, not like men,'' said Amer Zalloum, 19, tending his father's food stall. ''But they won't go, anyway. Have you seen Qiryat Arba? It's a city, and the Jews will never give it up.''</p>
