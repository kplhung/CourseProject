        <p>Of the various stories about their relationship that Laura and George W. Bush like to tell, not one gets a more frequent and thorough workout than this: she married him only after they had reached an agreement that she would never, ever have to make a political speech on his behalf.</p>
        <p>She must have been skeptical. It was the end of 1977, and Mr. Bush was gearing up for what would turn out to be an ill-fated campaign for a Congressional seat from West Texas, and his father was laying the groundwork for his own ill-fated presidential bid in 1980. These were the Bushes -- politics was in their plasma. Her vow of silence was doomed from the start.</p>
        <p>Laura Bush's appearance at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday night will be the latest -- and by far the most nerve-frazzling -- illustration of that. She is scheduled to deliver the first major address of the event, with thousands of people spread out before her, the invisible eyes of a national television audience on her and the responsibility for properly jump-starting a four-day jubilee in her hands.</p>
        <p>''I get butterflies a little bit, thinking about it,'' she said in a recent interview, adding that she remained a bit baffled by how she got from there to here, from a placid career as an elementary-school librarian back in the 1970's to the turbulent reality of a presidential campaign that has put her on a national stage, whether she wanted to be there or not.</p>
        <p>Her husband, too, marveled at that trajectory. ''If I'd have said, 'Honey, you'll be the kickoff speaker at the Republican convention in the year 2000,' she would have said, 'You've totally lost your mind, and I'm not marrying you,' '' he told several reporters at the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Tex., late last week.</p>
        <p>The couple's remarks point to one of the most intriguing aspects of Laura Welch Bush, a trait that sets her apart from many of her predecessors on this path: she never aspired to it, never planned on it, never looked out across the broad expanse of the future and saw herself in a wash of light, with a microphone under her chin. Even now, several of her friends and acquaintances say, she could trade it all for long afternoons of reading or mornings of gardening and be utterly happy -- perhaps even happier.</p>
        <p>And yet, friends and relatives say, she has adapted to her role in the limelight and her part as a political spouse with relative ease and remarkable vigor, drawing on a serious (albeit quiet) intellect to become an active first lady in Texas and to develop a public voice and style more mellifluous than her husband's, and maybe even more assured. Many of the voters who take note of Mrs. Bush for the first time on Monday night will undoubtedly be surprised and impressed by that, and will get little sense of the reluctance she openly expressed before Gov. George W. Bush began his campaign for the White House last year.</p>
        <p>Barbara Bush, the former first lady, said in a recent interview that her daughter-in-law adhered to ''a great philosophy in life -- you can either like it or not, so you might as well like it.''</p>
        <p>Laura Bush said that her convention speech was, in fact, a harbinger of more activity and a higher profile for her. With the couple's twin 18-year-old daughters, Jenna and Barbara, heading off to college around Labor Day and leaving the Bushes with an empty nest, Mrs. Bush plans to hit the campaign trail full time, at her husband's side and on her own.</p>
        <p>''An unbelievable life experience,'' she called it in one of several interviews in Austin over the last two months.</p>
        <p>But there were ever-present hints, in her words and gestures and the observations of those who know her best, that her attitude about this whole crazy pageant was much more complicated than that. After her husband literally got choked up when he talked about her during an event in Greensboro, N.C., three months ago, he explained in an interview, ''I know she's making a huge sacrifice.''</p>
        <p>And Mrs. Bush made it clear that her interest was in helping him, not promoting herself, and that she was not offering voters two for the price of one.</p>
        <p>''I'm not running for office,'' said Mrs. Bush, 53. ''George is running for office. I don't really even want to talk about issues that much. I'm not that knowledgeable about most issues.''</p>
        <p>''I know about education,'' she added, mentioning the topic of her convention speech. ''I know about things that I've worked on. But, you know, most other issues I don't know that much about. And just to put in my two cents to put in my two cents -- I don't think it's really necessary.''</p>
        <p>What a difference from four years ago, when Elizabeth Dole, roaming among the delegates at the Republican convention with a mobile microphone and an Oprahesque panache, was not simply singing the praises of her husband, Bob Dole, the party's presidential nominee, but also strutting her own political stuff. It turned out to be a prelude to her short-lived bid for the presidency last year.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the aisle hovered Hillary Rodham Clinton, a first lady who had never been timid about throwing in her thoughts and who also had a candidacy in her future.</p>
        <p>But their counterparts this time around, Tipper Gore and Laura Bush, seem to be more ambivalent recruits, as content in the background as in the foreground, yanked by their husbands' desires into races and places they might never have chosen for themselves.</p>
        <p>Contrasting Personalities</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush, an intensely private woman, shares none of her husband's showmanship or garrulousness; toward the end of an interview with her aboard his campaign plane, when the governor exuberantly jumped in to compete for the attention of the reporter seated beside her, she promptly turned away, pulled out several pieces of stationery and began writing thank-you notes to acquaintances.</p>
        <p>''George is always bouncing off the walls,'' observed Anne Johnson, who has known the couple for decades and whose husband, Clay, is the chief of staff in the governor's office. ''Laura is so quiet.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush says that contrast is one reason that their union, both personally and politically, works well.</p>
        <p>''I think I temper that personality,'' she said, referring to her husband's brashness, ''but I also think that he makes life much more exciting for me.''</p>
        <p>But both she and her husband's advisers seem unsure at times of how exactly to cast Mrs. Bush's degree of reserve.</p>
        <p>On one hand, they clearly see her detachment from the messier, more vainglorious dimensions of politics as an advantage: evidence to support her husband's assertion that he, too, is a grounded, down-to-earth person not driven by an insatiable ego or a partisan blood lust. The way Mr. Bush praised her in a recent interview was telling.</p>
        <p>''She cuts right through, through the posturing and positioning,'' Mr. Bush said proudly. ''America's starved for something. I'm telling you: they're starved for something real. And that's what she brings. She's a real person.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Bush campaign also does not want to present her as a bashful throwback or blandly dutiful helpmate -- an inaccurate portrait that might not play well with female swing voters and that decidedly sells Mrs. Bush short.</p>
        <p>In interviews with other journalists in the past, Mrs. Bush readily called herself shy, but she now emphatically rejects that label. Some of her friends go out of their way to do likewise. It is as if they all received the same memo.</p>
        <p>And an expression of distaste swept over her face recently when a New York Times reporter brought up a story, which had appeared elsewhere in print, that she had once answered a question from Mr. Bush's paternal grandmother about what she did with her life by saying, ''I read, I smoke and I admire.''</p>
        <p>''That's totally made up,'' Laura Bush said. ''I'm sure I said 'I read.' But I certainly didn't say 'I admire.' '' (As for smoking, Mrs. Bush eventually quit.)</p>
        <p>But Barbara Bush said in a recent interview that she remembered both her daughter-in-law's three-part answer and her mother-in-law's reaction.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Bush darn near collapsed,'' Barbara Bush said, recalling the response of the former president's mother.</p>
        <p>A Lover of Literature</p>
        <p>In truth, Laura Bush had a busy professional life as an elementary school teacher and librarian for a decade before she began dating George W. Bush, and she remained single, without pangs of worry, longer than any of her close female friends. She was 31 when she and Mr. Bush married in November 1977, three months after they met.</p>
        <p>Her avidity for reading is really an abiding love of literature, and when she and Mr. Bush were living in Dallas in the 1980's and raising their two daughters, Mrs. Bush, who had given up her career around the time of her wedding, used her spare hours to take classes on William Faulkner, Greek tragedy and other literary topics.</p>
        <p>During the Republican primaries earlier this year, she was on a Truman Capote binge, but had to interrupt it because she found herself in the middle of ''In Cold Blood'' just as Mr. Bush lost the New Hampshire contest to Senator John McCain of Arizona.</p>
        <p>''It's so foreboding,'' Mrs. Bush said of Mr. Capote's masterwork, ''and I was reading it during the most anxiety-provoking time and I had to quit.''</p>
        <p>Asked to name her favorite book, she cited part of one: the ''Grand Inquisitor'' section of ''The Brothers Karamazov'' by Dostoevsky.</p>
        <p>Although she said that she moved into the first lady's office in Austin in 1995, after her husband was first elected governor, with the expectation that ''cobwebs would grow on the phone,'' she did not let that happen.</p>
        <p>Right away, she became a driving force behind the inception of the annual Texas Book Festival, which has raised about $900,000 for the state's public libraries, and in 1998 and 1999, she helped write, lobby for, and secure the passage of legislation that allocated $17 million over two years to improve programs to teach preschool children in Texas to read.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush also has a sassy streak that gets scant attention.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Mr. Bush occasionally joked in public speeches that his wife had a librarian's narrow concept of oratory, and it amounted to a single syllable: ''Shhhh!'' Mrs. Bush was not amused.</p>
        <p>''In a speech, to kid him, to get back at him, I said he was a gregarious businessman who thought that a bibliography was the biography -- the story -- of the person who wrote the Bible,'' she recalled. She laughed heartily at the memory of her little act of revenge.</p>
        <p>And she has an adventurous impulse: for both her 40th and 50th birthdays, she went river rafting with four or her closest female friends, including a Democratic state senator in Kansas and a midwife in San Francisco who recently visited Indonesia to teach classes on childbirth. Around Austin, Mrs. Bush maintains a similarly eclectic mix of social acquaintances.</p>
        <p>Relatives and friends say that Mr. Bush often solicits her advice, asking for her gut read on people and situations, and she serves as his filter for much of what is written about him in newspapers and magazines, which she seems to monitor more closely than he does. He often tells reporters not what he thought of their articles, but what she did.</p>
        <p>Respecting Needs</p>
        <p>It is not at all clear that she shares his positions on significant issues. He opposes abortion; she declines to elucidate her feelings. He has presided over more executions than any other governor; she takes a pass on the topic of the death penalty as well.</p>
        <p>Still, in so many ways, she has followed his lead. He ran for governor despite her expressed fears about the privacy that their family would lose. Then he upped the ante by running for president, even though she had talked publicly about her trepidation.</p>
        <p>''I would never say to George, for something that he really wanted to do, that he couldn't do that,'' Mrs. Bush said, adding that he, too, would never deny her something that she deemed important. People who know the couple well have said that his decision to quit drinking 14 years ago was partly a response to her entreaties and to a growing worry that he was endangering his marriage and family life, which he cherished.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bush said that her own family life had been a stable and deeply loving one. She grew up as an only child in Midland, where her father, Harold B. Welch, was a successful home builder and her mother, Jenna Welch, kept his books. Although neither of her parents had finished college, they let Laura know early on that they expected her to go, and she was a conscientious, excellent student who never got into trouble.</p>
        <p>She was acutely aware of her mother's other failed attempts to have a child, several of which ended in premature babies who died within days, and she said that perhaps, as a result, ''I felt very obligated to my parents. I didn't want to upset them in any way.''</p>
        <p>She and Mr. Bush, who also grew up in Midland, went to different elementary schools but were in the seventh grade together at the same middle school, although neither of them remembers knowing the other very well. She stayed in Midland while he went to Philips Academy in Andover, Mass., and she and her friends described her high school years as happy and generally uneventful.</p>
        <p>But one day in 1963, when she was 17, she drove through a stop sign and hit another car. Its occupant, a boy who happened to be a close friend, was killed in the collision, which was deemed an accident; no charges were filed against her. Mrs. Bush said that she was steeled for the incident to come up during her husband's presidential campaign, as it did earlier this year, but she nonetheless tensed at the mention of it.</p>
        <p>''It was a terrible, terrible thing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the fall of 1964, she headed to Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where her major was education. It was a conventional choice, and one she briefly doubted in the years after her graduation in 1968. Feminism had come into vogue; she was reading some of the books that the movement had spawned, and she said she told her father that he should not have ''programmed'' her to be a teacher when she could have been a lawyer.</p>
        <p>''And Daddy almost immediately pulled out his wallet,'' she recalled, ''and said, 'I'll send you to law school.' He would have loved to.''</p>
        <p>But, she remembered, ''I had to admit, when he did that, that I didn't want to be a lawyer. I wanted to be a teacher.''</p>
        <p>She taught in racially mixed elementary schools in Dallas and Houston for three years, living at one time in the same apartment complex in Houston as her future husband, then a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. But her place was on the quiet wing, and his was on the rowdy one, and they never crossed paths.</p>
        <p>After getting a master's degree in library science from the University of Texas in 1973, she settled in Austin, where she worked as an elementary school librarian. She said that she never wanted for dates but had not found the right man until, in the summer of 1977, she paid a fateful visit to Midland, where Mr. Bush was making his way in the oil business. A couple who knew them both invited them over for a backyard barbecue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush talked and talked. Laura Welch listened and listened. The next night, he took her out for a game of miniature golf. And soon after that they said ''I do.''</p>
        <p>Adjustments were necessary. She was persuaded to make her first political speech the next year, when he waged his unsuccessful campaign for Congress. He learned to conform to her standards for tidiness and order, which were so high that one of her friends, Jan O'Neill, recalled that Mrs. Bush organized the books in the couple's bedroom in accordance with the Dewey decimal system.</p>
        <p>At Bush family gatherings, she made an unusual addition to the sometimes rambunctious clan. Her husband recalled his parents and siblings sitting around the table in Kennebunkport, Me., their plates clean, while they watched and waited patiently for his wife to pick her way through her meal.</p>
        <p>Finally, Their Own Family</p>
        <p>The couple wanted a large family of their own, tried for several years without success, and had already begun the adoption process when Mrs. Bush learned that she was finally pregnant with fraternal twins. Even then, the outlook was uncertain; she developed toxemia, and her doctor told her that she would be lucky to deliver one healthy child. Mrs. Bush said that whenever she went to the grocery store, she avoided the aisle with diapers and baby-related items, because she did not want to stoke her hopes.</p>
        <p>But everything turned out fine, and friends say she has been a fiercely devoted mother. They also say she has been an integral part of her husband's success, not because she is a second engine of his ambition, but because she is a shock absorber, keeping him calm, keeping him steady and, occasionally, keeping his mischievous and arrogant streaks in check.</p>
        <p>''Rein it in, Bubba,'' she told him one day on his campaign plane, as he held forth at length in front of reporters. Privately, when she catches him ribbing people mercilessly or strutting shamelessly, she simply murmurs, ''Bushieee,'' her voice rising at the end. He knows what that means.</p>
        <p>She says she has not given extensive thought to what kind of first lady she might make, but her mother-in-law has some ideas. Barbara Bush said her daughter-in-law would be different from Hillary Clinton because she would ''not get into foreign affairs or controversial subjects.''</p>
        <p>''I think she would rather make a positive impact on the country,'' Barbara Bush said. ''And I'm not criticizing Mrs. Clinton. But it's like oil and water. We're talking about two different subjects. They're two different people. I think Laura thinks of others.''</p>
        <p>She also said her daughter-in-law would be ''better, much better'' in the role than she was. ''She won't be a fat, white-haired old lady,'' Barbara Bush said.</p>
        <p>She would also be less voluble, and in many ways less accessible, because there are tight boundaries around what Laura Bush is willing to offer for public consumption.</p>
        <p>That was evident last September, when she accompanied her husband to an outdoor memorial service for the seven people killed by a gunman at a church in Fort Worth. She wore sunglasses, which she never took off. But every so often, she lifted a tissue to her face, delicately tucked it behind her dark lenses and then quickly put it away.</p>
        <p>The gesture was easy to miss, as she clearly intended it to be. Campaign or no campaign, Laura Bush was not about to share her tears.</p>
