      <abstract>
        <p>Noam Grunes letter on Alan Wolfe's July 24 article questions his argument for estate tax repeal</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alan Wolfe (Op-Ed, July 24) poignantly observes broad interest in repealing the estate tax, but justifies it by misrepresenting a large school of thought. Sociobiologists would be hard pressed to identify sacrificing for one's children as ''the very definition of altruism.'' True altruism extends beyond family.</p>
        <p>It does not require a follower of Immanuel Kant to appreciate the societal benefits of distributed wealth. Incentives to create foundations -- to give to a society flowing with both inequity and opportunity for the well-off to grow rich -- are incentives to altruistically further the public good.</p>

        <p>Contrary to Mr. Wolfe's intimation, Republicans have neither the high road nor the unanimous support of wealthy Americans on the estate tax issue.</p>
