        <p>Speculation that Mike Bordick will play two months for New York Mets and then sign free-agent contract to return to Baltimore Orioles discussed; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Mike Bordick said he had no idea where he would play baseball next season, but there has been a belief that Bordick will play two months for the Mets and then sign a free-agent contract to return to the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>Still, one baseball official said the Mets had had internal discussions about trying to re-sign the 35-year-old shortstop. That means that they would have to trade Rey Ordonez and, more important, that they would not get involved in the uncertain sweepstakes for Alex Rodriguez, a free-agent-to-be. The Mets do not have to make a decision yet, but they are mulling keeping Bordick because he is such a steady offensive and defensive player.</p>

        <p>Mike Bordick said he had no idea where he would play baseball next season, but there has been a belief that Bordick will play two months for the Mets and then sign a free-agent contract to return to the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>Still, one baseball official said the Mets had had internal discussions about trying to re-sign the 35-year-old shortstop. That means that they would have to trade Rey Ordonez and, more important, that they would not get involved in the uncertain sweepstakes for Alex Rodriguez, a free-agent-to-be. The Mets do not have to make a decision yet, but they are mulling keeping Bordick because he is such a steady offensive and defensive player.</p>
        <p>Since Ordonez has three years and $16 million left on his contract after this season, the Mets would have to unload him and eat part of the contract. But the Mets are concerned about the protracted negotiations that are likely to take place with the agent Scott Boras to sign the 25-year-old Rodriguez, who could command as much as $20 million a year, and there is no guarantee he will wind up with them.</p>
        <p>One reason the Orioles traded Bordick is because they offered him a multiyear deal at $4 million a year and he asked for $6.5 million. Some Mets officials think paying Bordick close to $6 million is a lot more appetizing than having the light-hitting Ordonez back or possibly chasing Rodriguez in vain. The shortstop question is one the Mets will continue pondering, and Bordick will be a major part of the discussion.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's a decision that has to be made in season by our organization or on Mike's part,'' said General Manager Steve Phillips, who also said the Mets had not talked about re-signing Bordick.</p>
        <p>Bordick and his wife have four children, and he spoke about the importance of some stability in his family life, leading observers to believe he would return to Maryland. But Bordick is from Maine, which is a short flight from New York.</p>
        <p>''At this point, I have no idea what might happen,'' said Joe Bick, Bordick's agent, who said he had not yet been contacted by the Mets.</p>
        <p>Bordick has been noncommittal about his future and simply said, ''I don't know what's going to happen at the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Top 10 List</p>
        <p>The Mets held a ceremony yesterday to announce the 10 greatest moments in club history, based on fans' online voting. In what is obviously attributable to the youth of the voters, the 1986 world champion Mets beat out the 1969 world champion Mets for first place. Because the 1969 team was a huge underdog to the Baltimore Orioles and won a title only seven years after the Mets made their debut with 120 losses, historically that season was surely more magical.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura's grand slam that was officially scored a single to win Game 4 of the 1999 National League Championship Series over the Atlanta Braves in the 15th inning finished third in the voting. The acquisition of Mike Piazza in 1998 was eighth, and Piazza was both flattered and embarrassed. ''I wish I would have a hit a big homer or something, not just have been traded,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Dykstra Wants to Manage</p>
        <p>Believe it or not, Lenny Dykstra, a member of the 1986 Mets who owns a car wash in California blandly called Lenny Dykstra's Car Wash, has aspirations to manage in the major leagues some day. ''I would go to the minor leagues and pay the price,'' said the 37-year-old Dykstra, who last played in 1996. ''We're in the entertainment business. Throw somebody in there with a little personality who knows how to win.''</p>
        <p>Trades: Watch This Space</p>
        <p>General Manager Steve Phillips said ''nothing is imminent'' as he discussed whether the Mets would make any moves before today's 4 p.m. nonwaiver trade deadline. Phillips could not identify a priority for the Mets since he acquired shortstop Mike Bordick, reliever Rick White and outfielder Bubba Trammell in two trades last Friday.</p>
