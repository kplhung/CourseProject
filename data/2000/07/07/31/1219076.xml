        <p>Sometimes a talented young person is pointedly discouraged from a professional career, as was Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna, called Nannerl, who was thought to be hardly less talented than he.

        <p>People who wish they had artistic talent usually find it hard to understand why anyone with such a gift would not use it. But there can be many complex reasons.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a talented young person is pointedly discouraged from a professional career, as was Mozart's older sister, Maria Anna, called Nannerl, who was thought to be hardly less talented than he. Typical of women of the period, she was not permitted to make music, except at home, after she turned 18. She married a magistrate, had three children, gave piano lessons and after her brother's death became a valued resource for Mozart biographers.</p>
        <p>Others may be stymied by internal conflicts, a situation poignantly captured by David Auburn's play ''Proof,'' which just closed at the Manhattan Theater Club. The central character, Catherine, whose father is an ingenious mathematics professor, drops out of college to care for him after he suffers a mental breakdown. As she turns sullen, cynical and isolated, it becomes clear that she, too, is a mathematical genius, although she has kept her work secret and shuns a career.</p>
        <p>Of course, most cases of forsaken talent rarely become public. Until now this has been true of the pioneering record producer Teresa Sterne, 73, Tracey to her friends and colleagues. From 1965 to 1979, as the director of Nonesuch Records, Ms. Sterne turned a budget classical label into one of the most adventurous companies in the business. But most of the young artists she nurtured, and even many of her close friends, had no idea that in her own youth she had been a piano prodigy.</p>
        <p>While keeping her past musical life to herself, Ms. Sterne made news at Nonesuch. She recorded repertory that other, bigger companies ignored: vernacular American song, world music and, especially, works by living composers. She set off a nationwide craze for ragtime with some popular recordings of Scott Joplin, performed by Joshua Rifkin. She sought out great though less well-known artists and helped establish their careers, among them the pianist Paul Jacobs, the mezzo-soprano Jan DeGaetani and the pianist Gilbert Kalish.</p>
        <p>But in 1979 she was dismissed, in a move that anticipated the current cutback on classical labels, in which innovative, smaller companies have been gobbled up by profit-minded conglomerates. The action brought howls of protest from critics and musicians in the United States and Europe and turned her into a sacrificial symbol of artistic principle.</p>
        <p>Some of her colleagues knew that Ms. Sterne had once been a serious pianist but assumed that she was a talented young musician who could not make it professionally and had wisely chosen another path.</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Sterne was a spectacularly gifted prodigy who made a notable New York debut at age 12, playing Grieg's Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden in 1939.</p>
        <p>For her debut with the New York Philharmonic the next year, she played Tchaikovsky's daunting Piano Concerto No. 1 at Lewisohn Stadium in Harlem before nearly 6,000 cheering people. And although several critics noted that the 13-year-old Ms. Sterne lacked the strength to fully handle the work's thundering octave passages, they uniformly praised her temperament, singing tone and impressive technique.</p>
        <p>Soon, thanks to the loyalty of a small group of friends and the commitment of Robert Hurwitz, the current director of Nonesuch Records, Ms. Sterne's early work as a pianist may become better known. In October, Nonesuch, the company from which she was once so publicly ousted, will release a two-disk recording in her honor. One disk will feature selections from some of the important albums she produced while directing the label. The other will present her as a young pianist in live performances. The deteriorating original tapes have been in Ms. Sterne's private collection for years. Although this archive is not large, it makes clear the depth of her gifts.</p>
        <p>There is a vibrant performance of Bach's ''Italian'' Concerto, made in 1939 when she was 11, and a mature and fleet account of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20, made just after she had turned 14. There is also an entire recital at the Brooklyn Museum in 1944, when she was 16, with works by Bach-von Bulow, Medtner, Debussy, Chopin and Beethoven, capped by a brilliant performance of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 13.</p>
        <p>There is a confident and rhapsodically lyrical Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, performed with the New York Philharmonic, again at Lewisohn Stadium, when she was 19. And more.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sterne and Mr. Hurwitz have been considering which performances to include on the fall recording. But Ms. Sterne has insisted on one: the sonata written for her by David Broekman, a Dutch-born composer and conductor who became her most important mentor. The recording is from a WNYC live studio recital in 1951, essentially her last public performance.</p>
        <p>So why did she not continue a career that had begun so splendidly? Sadly, she is now unable to explain.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sterne is suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the progressive deterioration of the motor nerves commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. She is confined to her apartment on the Upper West Side, with its Oriental carpets, rows of books and records, a grand piano stacked with music, photographs on the walls of grateful artists she has recorded and a letter from President Jimmy Carter, thanking her for championing American music, that hangs inconspicuously in the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Other than health care aides, she will see no one except a small circle of close friends. Having never married, and with no surviving relatives, she has appointed a longtime friend, Norma Hurlburt, who recently became the executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, as her health-care proxy. The once voluble Ms. Sterne, who was famous among her friends and colleagues for filling up their telephone answering machine tapes, is now barely able to speak.</p>
        <p>Obviously she is unable to take part in interviews. But in a letter she wrote a few years ago to a friend, the music critic Richard Freed, which was passed on to this reporter, she spoke at length about what led her to abandon a concert career. And during a series of talks with Ms. Hurlburt, who visits daily, Ms. Sterne was able to articulate a few answers to questions posed for this article.</p>
        <p>She was born in Brooklyn to a cultured family with a toehold on the middle class. Her mother was a cellist who had been part of a trio that played in movie houses and fancy restaurants, but she stopped working to devote herself to her talented daughter's development. Ms. Sterne's father, a violinist, deserted the family when she was 14. Her paternal uncle, Robert Sterne, also a professional violinist, provided musical counseling and financial support.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sterne studied piano with a series of local teachers and from the age of 10 was educated at home by private tutors.</p>
        <p>''We managed to live in a kind of aristocratic poverty,'' Ms. Sterne wrote to Mr. Freed. ''The Brooklyn house was long paid off, and expenses like oil heat, etc., were quite minimal. My little aunt, who lived also at that beautiful house, was 'moonlighting' after her daytime job at the New York State Attorney General's office as a legal secretary.'' Ms. Sterne's ''poor dear mama,'' she added, did what she could, working as a nanny or sewing and taking odd jobs.</p>
        <p>The program booklets and faded press clippings from Ms. Sterne's years as a prodigy are contained in a large scrapbook with crumbling black pages. Several early profiles indicate how constrained her childhood was.</p>
        <p>''Teresa looks not very different from a thousand other pretty, chubby 12-year-olds in Brooklyn,'' one article in PM's Weekly reported. ''But she doesn't go to school and doesn't play with the other girls in her neighborhood.'' The interviewer also noted that young Teresa did not have time to pay attention to ''the modern swing music,'' then the rage.</p>
        <p>''That's all right for children who don't understand the classics,'' young Teresa is quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sterne's career progressed steadily through her teenage years. At 20 she auditioned for the powerful manager Arthur Judson, who offered to arrange a European tour for her, at a cost: $10,000.</p>
        <p>''People in our circumstance couldn't even visualize that much money,'' she wrote in the letter to Mr. Freed. Still, it was not just the expense that stymied her, as she explained recently to Ms. Hurlburt.</p>
        <p>''I lacked the sophistication about how to build a career,'' Ms. Sterne said. ''My conscience drove me to join the working world. I didn't want to be a parasite.''</p>
        <p>She took courses in touch-typing and stenography and decided to ''change her image'' by enrolling in a low-budget modeling school, where she learned to walk like a lady and wear makeup. ''I had grown up not knowing there were boys and girls, just people and pianists,'' she wrote in the letter. ''I needed terribly to get out into 'the city' and find some kind of life for myself.''</p>
        <p>She took a job as a secretary and  model in a knitwear showroom in the garment district, where she typed ''about 100 letters a day and got propositioned by various young fellows,'' she wrote. For a time she worked in the offices of Sol Hurok, the famous manager, helping to promote the careers of other young pianists. Eventually she spent six years at Vanguard Records, ending up as personal secretary to the director.</p>
        <p>So in 1965, when Jac Holzman, the head of Elektra, the parent company of Nonesuch Records, offered her the directorship of the Nonesuch label, she was full of idealism, hardened by the realities of the record business and ready.</p>
        <p>In an elegant assessment of Ms. Sterne's missionary zeal as a record producer, written in 1980 following her dismissal, the New Yorker critic Andrew Porter commented, ''When a promising new composition has been billed, when a new ensemble -- Renaissance, Baroque or contemporary -- has made its debut, Teresa Sterne has been there in the hall, eager to ensure that the best of what and who deserve recording and dissemination do get recorded.''</p>
        <p>But during her tenure in the 1970's, Elektra and Nonesuch were acquired by Warner Communications. Nonesuch, the company's only classical label, was losing money, Joe Smith, the head of Elektra/Asylum/ Nonesuch, declared.</p>
        <p>''Nonesuch is in business, and it is losing its credibility in its marketplace,'' he said in a blunt interview with The Boston Globe. ''We can't make records that sell only outside the Russian Tea Room.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sterne's defenders argued that sales of Nonesuch recordings had suffered from poor marketing and distribution by the parent company. Yet rather then oust the marketing director, the company dismissed Ms. Sterne and put the marketing director in charge.</p>
        <p>The label drifted for several years, until late 1984, when Mr. Hurwitz took over. Today, he asserted in a recent interview, he works with popular artists like the soprano Dawn Upshaw and the Kronos Quartet and has the freedom to record unusual fare, like Louis Andriessen's opera ''Rosa'' and Stephen Sondheim's first musical, ''Saturday Night.'' Still, he acknowledges that he has not matched Ms. Sterne's commitment to the most complex, serious contemporary music.</p>
        <p>Though she never would have anticipated becoming a record executive when she was an adolescent pianist practicing for five and six hours a day, Ms. Sterne now sees her Nonesuch work as a logical outgrowth of her artistry and idealism.</p>
        <p>As she recently told Ms. Hurlburt, ''I felt I could do more to disseminate music at the highest level through recording artists I felt the whole world had to hear than through my own performances.''</p>
