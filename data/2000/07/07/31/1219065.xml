        <p>Caught like a subway train in a system with malfunctioning signals, San Francisco's newspapers have been stuck in place for almost a year. Last week, a federal judge threw a switch, and the city's leading newspaper owner, the Hearst Corporation, moved quickly forward.</p>
        <p>Legally freed to complete its deals to buy The San Francisco Chronicle and sell The San Francisco Examiner, Hearst did both in 26 hours.</p>
        <p>Now, with the antitrust battle apparently behind it, Hearst has important decisions to make. Having promised that all Examiner employees can work at The Chronicle, it must consolidate two newsrooms. It must select a publisher and a top editor and it must decide what battles to fight in a several-front war.</p>
        <p>There will be a new and different Examiner. Ted Fang, the new owner, is free to remake it in the image of his family's other publications as an emphatically local community paper that wears its political agenda on its sleeve. Should The Chronicle, which sells more copies outside San Francisco than in it, go ultra-local in city coverage to compete?</p>
        <p>Jay T. Harris, the publisher of The San Jose Mercury News, (circulation 289,000) The Chronicle's Silicon Valley competitor to the south, has taken the battle for readers into San Francisco, where he now has 2,000 readers. Mr. Harris has added 200 newspaper boxes and 70 retail sales outlets -- all the better to sell the new edition, which drops ''San Jose'' from its name plate.</p>
        <p>Should The Chronicle (circulation 465,000) respond in kind, expanding its coverage of Santa Clara County, and of the Silicon Valley business empires that are the showpiece of the national economy?</p>
        <p>National newspapers like USA Today, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are a growing presence. Metro, the Swedish-based company that brought its free tabloid product to commuters on Philadelphia's bus and subway system earlier this year, is hoping to start up in San Francisco. Should The Chronicle offer more news digests, like Metro, or its own national and international coverage?</p>
        <p>San Francisco is going to be more competitive than it has ever been, said William Dean Singleton, chief executive of the MediaNews Group, whose papers in Alameda County are an irritant on the Chronicle's southeast flank. P. Anthony Ridder, chief executive of Knight Ridder, which owns The Mercury News as well as The Contra Costa Times, east of San Francisco Bay, suggests dryly that readers would be well served by the competition and better served if they bought his newspapers.</p>
        <p>Some journalists in The Chronicle's old newsroom are eager to compete regionally. With enough invested by Hearst, they think The Chronicle can rise to heights that have eluded it. Ken Conner, an assistant city editor, welcomes competition with The Mercury News. ''We are serious,'' he said. ''They are serious. It would be a great newspaper war.''</p>
        <p>But decisions usually require planning, and while the antitrust case brought by Clinton Reilly, a multimillionaire real estate executive, remained undecided, Hearst forbade Examiner and Chronicle executives from talking about the future. Now they can talk. But who will lead the discussions? The career of Timothy O. White, the Examiner's onetime publisher is in limbo. Testimony during the antitrust trial disclosed that Mr. White had suggested ''horse-trading'' with Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. (I support your campaign, you stop opposing Hearst's plans.)</p>
        <p>Perhaps Steven Falk, the president of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, the business arm of both papers, which have had a joint operating agreement since 1965. Perhaps someone like W. Lawrence Walker Jr., a decade ago the No. 2 executive at the San Francisco agency, and now a seasoned publisher at Hearst's San Antonio Express-News with practical experience in shutting down a joint operating agreement.</p>
        <p>It is unclear who will be picked first, an editor or a publisher. It is also unclear if candidates include people at other newspapers. But soon, someone has to decide if the home-delivery schedule needs to be moved up, to compete with The Mercury News. Someone will have to tell the reporters what jobs they will be doing. If only one television critic is needed, what happens to the second one? How many metropolitan columnists should there be?</p>
        <p>For Gerald J. Roberts, The Chronicle's current managing editor, the top three priorities are creating a robust Sunday paper, expanding coverage of local news, and coverage of collegiate and high school sports.</p>
        <p>For Phil Bronstein, The Examiner's executive editor, city and suburban news coverage are crucial, but the most-pressing priority is business coverage (''this is the center of a universe, if not the universe, in technology.'') Both men want some foreign coverage; both mention Asia and Mexico.</p>
        <p>For Jay Harris, at The Mercury News, everything matters. ''As the impact of Silicon Valley expands,'' he said, ''we want to expand with it.'' And the richest readership lies northward, in The Chronicle's heartland.</p>
