        <p>He is not your garden-variety homeless guy.</p>
        <p>Sitting on a plastic lawn chair in a grubby white T-shirt and jeans as his two dogs wrestle nearby, John Schultheis looks more like a rugged camper than a homeless man battling the brutal city streets.</p>
        <p>His version of a park bench is a grassy field on Shelter Island, where he sleeps in a tent he bought for $55 at Kmart. He cooks meals of chicken or hamburgers on a mini-grill, talks to his wife on a cell phone and even manages to run his own business. Every few weeks, he mows.</p>
        <p>But as far as Mr. Schultheis is concerned, he is homeless. He said he and his wife, Maria, were kicked out of their rental home last month when someone made an offer to buy it that the couple could not match.</p>
        <p>''Believe me, I really have nowhere to live,'' said Mr. Schultheis, 36, who moved into his tent July 7. His wife is living with a nearby family for whom she works as a caretaker. Mr. Schultheis was invited to stay there, too, but declined, saying he did not want to be a burden.</p>
        <p>''This was my last possible option,'' Mr. Schultheis insisted. ''This was the only way my wife and I could both survive, save some money until we find a more permanent place to live.''</p>
        <p>But in his sleepy hometown of Shelter Island, nestled between the North and South Forks on the eastern end of Long Island, where his family roots date back five generations, his decision has raised the eyebrows of a few town officials, who have recently ordered him off the property.</p>
        <p>The island is hardly the place for crime -- the first and only recorded murder in its 350-year history took place in 1998 -- or the homeless.</p>
        <p>To those who call Shelter Island home, it's a place where almost everyone knows everyone else's business, where an old couple sit out on the porch in rocking chairs waving to passers-by, where shop owners leave  freshly cut flowers unattended outside their stores, trusting that their customers will pay.</p>
        <p>So, Mr. Schultheis became sort of an oddity when he billed himself as ''Shelter Island's first homeless man'' at a recent Town Board meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis's longtime friend Daniel Calabro, a local businessman who owns the lot that he is living on, was issued a summons two weeks ago for allowing him to live there. According to the summons, Mr. Calabro is violating a town code that says landowners can allow someone to camp on their  property only temporarily.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis says he is a bit surprised at the fuss the town is making and the attention he is receiving from the local press. Two weeks ago, his story landed on the front page of The Shelter Island Reporter, the town's weekly newspaper.</p>
        <p>Vocal town officials have called Mr. Schultheis's actions an embarrassment to the town.</p>
        <p>William Banks, the town's building inspector, who issued the summons, says this is the first time he has ever heard of such a thing. He has lived here since 1960. And the town has received at least 50 complaints about Mr. Schultheis's tent, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banks says that if one person were allowed to camp indefinitely on the island, then more people, homeless or not, could start pitching their tents. Mr. Banks also scoffs at the idea that Mr. Schultheis is really homeless because he has a job and money in the bank.</p>
        <p>''It's a very bold, in-your-face move,'' he said. ''I think he's a fool. He's trying to prove some kind of a point, but this is no way to go about doing it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schultheis says that is all bunk; he is doing only what any homeless man would do, he argues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis says he is just one of many of the native islanders caught in the battle between the island's wealthy summer visitors and year-round residents, most of whom make a modest income working in family stores or operating the ferries that take people on and off the island.</p>
        <p>Shelter Island has fewer than 3,000 inhabitants year-round. But during the summer, the island becomes a cozy vacation spot to those with money to spend who shun the glamour of the celebrity-saturated Hamptons to the south, and the population exceeds 7,500.</p>
        <p>Real estate costs have skyrocketed in recent years. Summer rents for two- or three-bedroom houses average $10,000 a month, which Mr. Schultheis says he does not have.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, he says, finding a place where his two beloved Labradors, Daisy and Finneas, can stay was next to impossible. Mr. Schultheis says the homes he could afford to rent were already snatched up by outsiders, and none allowed pets.</p>
        <p>''People have asked me, 'Why don't you put them in kennels?' '' he said. ''I don't know how you feel about animals, but these dogs are my children. It's like telling me to adopt my kids out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis says his family has been unable to help. His father died two months ago, and his mother, who was married to his father for 53 years, is still grieving.</p>
        <p>He gave up searching and asked Mr. Calabro to allow him to pitch a tent on his vacant parcel. Mr. Calabro agreed, provided that he mowed the grassy lot every few weeks and found a bathroom elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Maria Schultheis then moved in with Glenn and Gail Heinze and their three children. The Heinzes also invited Mr. Schultheis to stay, but he said he was afraid of putting additional strain on his wife's employers, so he opted for the tent.</p>
        <p>''I may be homeless, but I have manners,'' he said. ''I didn't want to get in the way. The dogs wake up early in the morning and bark. I don't want anything to reflect badly on my wife.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis grew up on the island in a well-to-do family, his father a prominent dermatologist. He said that as a teenager, he went off to boarding school in Dublin, N.H., then attended a college in Switzerland for a year before transferring to a technical college in New York, where he graduated. He says he is fluent in French, German and Italian.</p>
        <p>Seven years ago, he and his wife moved to Shelter Island, with hopes of making it a permanent home.</p>
        <p>''I had dreams of living and dying here,'' he says. ''But now it looks like I may have to go some place I can afford.''</p>
        <p>He and his wife have stored all their belongings in the Heinzes' basement. Each morning, Mr. Schultheis walks to the Heinzes' house with his dogs to wash up and change into clean clothes before heading to work.</p>
        <p>His wife's salary has been the  Schultheises' main source of income since they were kicked out of their home. Mr. Schultheis also has a business he started a few months ago called Honey-Do Homecare, doing chores and odd jobs, like moving furniture or cleaning out the garage, for people who are not physically able.</p>
        <p>At some point or another, most town residents have seen Mr. Schultheis's tent pitched off Ferry Road, the main road that winds through the island. Most either giggle at his eccentricity or sympathize with his plight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schultheis hopes to find a place to live by September, when rental prices go down. If not, he is planning to leave the island to find a place where real estate prices are a little cheaper.</p>
        <p>He plans to accompany his friend Mr. Calabro to court sometime in the next week to try to get a judge to let Mr. Schultheis stay on the lot longer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calabro shook his head at the turn of events during the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>''I'm just trying to help the guy out,'' he said. ''No one wants to live like this forever.''</p>
