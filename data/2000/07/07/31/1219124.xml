        <p>It was a pro-democracy rally against the ouster of the lawfully elected government of an entire American city, taking place across the river from the cradle of liberty, practically within earshot of the thousands of journalists gathered for the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>But when Camden's leaders took to the streets for the first time yesterday to denounce New Jersey's plan to take over their crumbling city of 85,000, only about 45 people showed up.</p>
        <p>''Democracy for Camden'' was the protest's theme, but its purpose seemed blurred, with some placards demanding reparations for slavery and an end to the Navy bombing of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.</p>
        <p>Despite the national attention bound to be drawn to what would be the largest municipal takeover since the Great Depression, and despite the assertions of several of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's fellow Republicans in the State Legislature that the takeover plan is dictatorial, it was a tiny crowd that turned out to march politely down Admiral Wilson Boulevard, a police escort in the lead and a string of vehicles from news organizations filling in the rear.</p>
        <p>Mayor Milton Milan, who is under federal indictment on corruption charges, did not attend, nor did Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the City Council and a fierce opponent of a state takeover. But Ali Sloan-El, a Council member and the organizer of the march, said that even a small number could get its message to the Republicans gathering this evening on the Camden waterfront for a reception held by Mrs. Whitman.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to get the nation to see that Camden is dealing with some serious issues,'' Mr. Sloan-El said. ''The governor says she wants to take over the city and take our vote away without telling us anything about what we will get in return.''</p>
        <p>Camden has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, and has been subsisting on state revenues to fill the gap in its budget.</p>
        <p>But years of state supervision of the city has failed to produce results, Mrs. Whitman has said, and she introduced legislation earlier this month that would permit the state to take over city government.</p>
        <p>Brother Zawdie Abdul-Malik, a member of Camden's elected Board of Education, also marched and carefully corrected reporters' spelling of his name (''My father was a mister,'' he said. ''I'm a brother.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdul-Malik, whose school board is also under state scrutiny, said the demonstration was meant to warn state officials not to take the city's leadership for granted.</p>
        <p>''This march is intended to let the country know that there's just a high level of dissatisfaction with the way the state is proceeding on this takeover,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdul-Malik and the protesters may have more friends in the Legislature in Trenton, in the short run at least, than they imagine. The takeover bill was introduced in the last days of the current legislative session's spring term, and many lawmakers read about the proposal's management plan without having first heard much from administration officials about the urgency for action that the governor perceives in the city.</p>
        <p>Legislative Democrats, who are in the minority in both houses, are broadly opposed to a complete takeover of a Democratic-voting city. They said their members would probably wait to see how the majority modified the bill before deciding how to act.</p>
        <p>Many of those Republicans are also uncomfortable with the idea of voting to usurp the right to self-representation in a mostly black and Hispanic city, and putting an unelected state official in charge of an entire city.</p>
        <p>That uneasiness is particularly strong among the many members of the Legislature who also hold, or who have held, elected municipal office themselves.</p>
        <p>Senator Leonard T. Connors Jr., a Republican, is the chairman of the Community and Urban Affairs Committee, through which the takeover bill would presumably have to pass. He has also been the mayor of Surf City since 1966, and he said he had serious reservations about taking away municipal authority.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a pretty strong bill to impose on people, to disenfranchise the voters of a municipality,'' Mr. Connors said. ''If there's corruption, it can be dealt with in the courts of law, but the operation of local government should not be summarily dismissed and turned over to the bureaucrats in Trenton. I don't think they are going to do any better than those folks.'' Without yet taking a formal position, the New Jersey League of Municipalities, which represents 560 New Jersey local governments in Trenton, has also made members' feelings clear.</p>
        <p>''We're basically opposed to the whole concept of having some state-appointed administrator go into Camden or any other municipality,'' said William G. Dressel Jr., the league's executive director. ''Quite frankly, we may be talking about Camden today, but we could be talking about any other municipality tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, partly to avoid seeming to single out the state's most stricken city, the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, Senate Bill S1507, does not even mention Camden.</p>
        <p>Jane M. Kenny, the commissioner of the state community affairs department, which oversees local government, acknowledged that her office had a way to go in persuading legislators and municipal groups of the dire nature of Camden's problems. Ms. Kenny said she had been focusing her efforts on urban legislators.</p>
        <p>''I very pleased that they are engaging in a discussion with us, and I think that, obviously, we need to engage further and make sure the legislators fully understand the deep problems we are facing in Camden,'' Ms. Kenny said. ''I don't think all of them do at this point. I don't think they fully understand the insidious nature of the problems we face.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kenny said that the state was prepared to accept some modifications in the bill, particularly, she said, for changes that would give the Camden City Council a more prominent role under a state manager.</p>
        <p>But the commissioner made it plain that the state would fight to keep most legislative and administrative powers in the hands of a ''chief management officer,'' as the legislation puts it, selected by the state.</p>
        <p>''We have to have a strong hand,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Senator Martha W. Bark, a Republican from the Camden suburb of Medford and the bill's sponsor, also said the legislation's perceived anti-democratic elements may be softened.</p>
        <p>''This bill will go through a thorough hearing and it will be modified,'' Senator Bark said. ''People have reached out to me and told me what they feel are right and wrong approaches. I will listen to all of those. However, I still feel very strongly about the opportunity to do something for Camden.</p>
        <p>''The state has put in a lot of time and money and the city is still not turned around.''</p>
        <p>As for being anti-democratic, Ms. Bark said, the state has been taking over urban school districts and usurping the powers of ineffective but elected school boards for years without much of an outcry beyond the districts in question. Yet that argument hardly satisfied Senator Connors, the chairman of the Urban Affairs Committee.</p>
        <p>''Is there is a crisis in Camden? Damn right there is -- I'm not going to say there isn't,'' Mr. Connors said. ''But it isn't any bigger crisis than in Newark, and didn't we take over the Newark schools and run them into a $58 million deficit that the taxpayers now have to pick up? So what makes the bureaucrats think they will be the super wizard that can run Camden any better?''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Kenny said that a takeover would ''open up'' the city government to new faces and new skills from Camden residents. She might have had someone like Jeff Slaton in mind, a young construction supervisor currently working on Newark Airport projects. He said he was at the march because his wife wanted him to come -- she is a city ward committee member -- but as he stood at the fringe of the demonstration, he said a state takeover might not be such a bad idea.</p>
        <p>''We've seen the old way of doing things, and we can see it's not working,'' Mr. Slaton said. ''I think it may be time to try the state takeover as a temporary thing, to give the citizens a chance to elect someone who's capable of running this city.''</p>
