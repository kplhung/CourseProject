        <p>A gray, windy morning, late November to the core.</p>
        <p>Office workers on downtown Market Street push through the billows of fog, holding their trench coats against the chill. Newspaper vendors keep their kiosk windows closed. An old man selling red roses ($2 a stem) outside the Bay Area Rapid Transit train station is wearing wool gloves and a ski cap pulled way down.</p>
        <p>Courtney Schirmer is standing on a corner of First and Market Streets, waiting for a bus to ferry her across town to her job at a graphics design company. She is wearing a leather motorcycle jacket, Army green corduroys and heavy black boots.</p>
        <p>''I hate being cold,'' she says, pulling a canvas hat and a pullover sweater from her backpack to show she means it. ''I'm from Orange County. Three summers here, and I've learned how to pile dress.''</p>
        <p>Yes, it is summer in San Francisco, the country's capital of cool. That's cool as in temperatures, in the 50's morning and night, 60's at high noon. Cool as in a daily mist that gnaws at old bones and bum knees. The cool justifies the cafes at nearly every corner and the sweatshirts in the souvenir shops off Union Square.</p>
        <p>Lately, it has been so cool in the city -- 4 or 5 degrees cooler, at an average of 63 degrees, than is typical in July -- that the heat that has scorched much of the South seems as foreign as beach days and backyard pools. Planes get fogged in at the airport and there is no going out at night without a jacket. A hat is a good move, too. But San Franciscans simply say ''groovy'' and stroll along.</p>
        <p>They say this is just the way it is here. Summer bypasses this place as if there is not enough heat to go around. In Oakland, 10 minutes over the Bay Bridge, it is 10 degrees warmer, with the sun a notch brighter and the breeze as light as baby's breath. And for every 10 miles inland from San Francisco, the conventional wisdom goes, the weather gets warmer and warmer.</p>
        <p>Yet San Franciscans worth their chest-thumping civic pride are proud of this paradise of perpetual spring. They boast about the city's foggy bottom as though there were nothing to be said for the tropical sun of Oahu or the autumn leaf show in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>''This is the best weather in the country,'' said Skye Fernandez, a Web page designer who has lived in San Francisco virtually all her 30 years. She was standing on trendy Valencia Street in the city's Mission District, wearing a furry wool sweater as she waited for a lunch table. Her friend Bobbi Greene braved the breeze in a T-shirt.</p>
        <p>''People who complain about the summer here have forgotten how bad it is everywhere else,'' said Ms. Greene, who moved here from West Hartford, Conn., 12 years ago. ''The fog burns off by late morning, usually. It doesn't come back until late afternoon. In between, it's perfect.''</p>
        <p>Tourists beg to differ. ''Horrible,'' said Corinne Gulon of Lyons, France, as she surveyed the day in Chinatown. ''I arrived here, and no one can swim. I tried yesterday at 12 and had no luck because of the fog.''</p>
        <p>Locals love trotting out the line Mark Twain supposedly said about the coldest winter he ever spent being a summer in San Francisco. (Historians say he never said it, but it is too good to resist. Every San Francisco weather story uses it.)</p>
        <p>All city residents have learned (as Jan Null, a meteorologist with the Golden Gate Weather Service, explained to this outsider) that the natural air-conditioning is caused when California's interior Central Valley heats up in the summer, creating lower air pressure that causes a sea breeze. The water off the coast is about 55 degrees, and as the air blows over the top of the water it creates the cool city residents love.</p>
        <p>''You must be from the East Coast if you think you miss 90 degrees,'' said J. J. Bunce, a software engineer and recovering New Yorker who has lived here 15 years. ''Summer is just a state of mind.''</p>
