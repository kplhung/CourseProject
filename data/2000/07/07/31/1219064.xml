        <p>Next year, Viacom's UPN television network is changing its name. As of January, it will be called the Paramount Network.</p>
        <p>Executives made the change to go with the corporate flow. Chris-Craft Industries Inc. has sold its 50 percent share of the network, which was originally named for Viacom's Paramount Television Group and Chris-Craft's United Stations.</p>
        <p>But executives say they did not like the way UPN sounded anyway. And, according to their research, it did not mean anything to viewers. Paramount seemed a better fit because of its identification with a major movie studio, they said.</p>
        <p>Adam Ware, the network's chief financial officer, said, '' 'Paramount' meant Hollywood, it meant movies, it meant television.''</p>
        <p>The timing for the name change would seem strange. After years of struggling, UPN finally saw a big increase in ratings this past year, thanks in large part to its Thursday night World Wrestling Federation program. By changing names, executives admit, they run the risk of confusing viewers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ware said that every effort will be made to make them aware of the change before it happens.</p>
        <p>He added that executives hope that the change helps attract more ads. Though its ratings have improved, the network is still not profitable.</p>
        <p>Viacom's new chief executive, Mel Karmazin, has said that if it does not become profitable soon, he will get rid of it.</p>
