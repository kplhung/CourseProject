        <p>The Alltel Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest wireless communications carrier, is expected to announce today the acquisition of wireless operations in Louisiana from SBC Communications for about $400 million.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Alltel, which is based in Little Rock, Ark., expects to gain about 165,000 wireless customers and 300,000 paging customers in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The transaction also includes some rural services.</p>
        <p>SBC is selling the properties to eliminate overlap resulting from the linking of its wireless operations with BellSouth's. Alltel, which already has about 6 million wireless subscribers in 22 states, is trying to expand along the Gulf Coast.</p>
        <p>''Unlike some other companies in this industry we're interested in buying and not being bought,'' Joe Ford, Alltel's chief executive, said in a phone interview.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the wireless industry in the United States has been gripped by acquisition fever, most recently with Deutsche Telekom's planned acquisition of the  VoiceStream Wireless Corporation for more than $50 billion, which was announced last week. But Alltel, larger than VoiceStream though still a relatively small wireless player, has been strangely absent from the speculative talk on which wireless companies will be the next takeover targets.</p>
        <p>Instead, companies like Nextel Communications, of Reston, Va., a provider of wireless services for corporate customers, and Powertel, a consumer-oriented wireless company based in Statesboro, Ga., have been mentioned as likelier consolidation candidates.</p>
        <p>That may reflect the low profile of Alltel, which has made more than 250 landline and wireless acquisitions since it began as a local telephone company in Arkansas in 1947.</p>
        <p>''The whole world is looking at wireless now, but we've been in this business for a long time now,'' said Mr. Ford. ''We're happy to keep blending together other companies into our own because that's just what we do.''</p>
