        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a July 24 front-page article, you report that 96 percent of high school seniors had passed the English Regents exam as of January, and that educators are concerned about the new scoring system that makes it possible for students to pass the exam with ''barely comprehensible'' essays.</p>
        <p>But why can't these students write proper essays? The reason is simple. Students do not receive enough preparation for the Regents exams. As a recent graduate of the public school system, I can attest that writing courses are not mandatory.</p>

        <p>The curriculum should be adjusted to include writing classes during the early years. In the meantime, schools should add courses to the programs of current high school students. Regents exams were introduced to create uniform standards for New York's graduating seniors. But by lowering the tests' standards, aren't we continuing to allow students to float through?</p>
