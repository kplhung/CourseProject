        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a July 26 news article, you report that the police wrenched a false confession from a suspect in an assault case after ''20 hours of grilling in a precinct house,'' and that, on the basis of new evidence indicating the suspect was elsewhere at the time of the assault, the Manhattan State Supreme Court ordered his release.</p>
        <p>Before she learned that the suspect had been released, the victim, Tiffany F. Goldberg, said, ''It would really compound my suffering to see him handled in merely a punitive way.'' More charity was forthcoming from the victim than from the Police Department, which is charged with, among other things, protecting people.</p>

        <p>This practice of ''grilling'' is torturous and a clear violation of human rights. It often leads to false confessions and must be banned.</p>
