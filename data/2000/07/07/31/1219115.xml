        <p>Trying to portray her opponent in the Senate race as out of touch with mainstream voters, Hillary Rodham Clinton described Representative Rick A. Lazio yesterday as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry for taking contributions from drug makers and voting against a bill to subsidize prescription drugs for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters yesterday afternoon in the courtyard of the Municipal Building, Mrs. Clinton voiced her support for the Democrats' prescription-drug bill. She reiterated her own proposal to legalize the importing of medicine from abroad, where drugs are frequently cheaper.</p>
        <p>''My opponent is on the side of drug companies and the Republican leadership,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who was ringed by a small group of elderly and disabled New Yorkers assembled by a consumers group, Citizen Action. ''Time and time again he has demonstrated where his heart and his allegiance really rests.''</p>
        <p>As she has in several recent appearances, including an address to an enthusiastic audience of churchgoers in Harlem yesterday morning, Mrs. Clinton tried to draw, sometimes with tart sarcasm, a sharp line between herself and Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''My conservative Republican opponent often says he's mainstream,'' she said. ''But it's neither compassionate nor mainstream to leave millions of your fellow citizens without the guarantee of affordable prescription drug coverage, especially when you're a member of Congress and you get top of the line medical coverage, including prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Lazio voted for a Republican prescription-drug plan that looked to private business to provide new coverage. Under that measure, federal subsidies would be used to encourage insurance companies to offer drug coverage to the elderly and offer Medicare beneficiaries a choice of two drug plans.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Bryan Flood, denounced the Democrats' plan as a ''one size fits all'' approach that did not offer consumers a choice. He scoffed at Mrs. Clinton's suggestion that donations from drug makers had colored Mr. Lazio's views.</p>
        <p>''It's a desperate charge by an increasingly desperate campaign,'' Mr. Flood contended. ''As a legislator, Congressman Lazio votes in the best interests of New Yorkers. It's absurd to suggest that his votes are related to who gives him campaign contributions.''</p>
        <p>Lazio campaign aides did not try to refute Mrs. Clinton's charge that he had benefited from $30,000 in donations from the pharmaceutical industry. They simply pointed out that his campaign had raised more than $9 million so far.</p>
        <p>They also used Mrs. Clinton's comments on prescription drugs to recall her unsuccessful bid for universal health coverage in the early years of President Clinton's administration. ''Hillary Clinton doesn't have a record on very much; she does have a record on this,'' Mr. Flood said. ''It wasn't too long ago she was trying to socialize our nation's health care system.''</p>
        <p>Public opinion polls show that drug prices and the need for prescription drug coverage are major concerns of many voters. And Mrs. Clinton, joined yesterday by elderly New Yorkers angered by steep monthly increases in prescription drug expenses, has a potentially huge base among senior citizens, an important voting bloc. Beyond that, Mrs. Clinton's attack on her opponent's position on prescription drugs appeared to be part of a larger effort to cast him as a far-right Republican concealed in moderate garb.</p>
        <p>''I hear a lot of talk about compassionate conservatives,'' she said sarcastically yesterday at Metropolitan A.M.E. Church in Harlem. ''I guess that means somebody who feels really bad when your doctor doesn't give you the treatment you need because he's been told he can't by the H.M.O.''</p>
        <p>Attacks like this one got her a good response from the crowd. There were shouts of ''Amen'' and loud murmurs of affirmation. And every time her name was mentioned by a speaker, the people in the pews rose for a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>Her audience included several members of the city's black Democratic leadership, from Bill Lynch, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, to United States Representative Charles E. Rangel.</p>
        <p>''Compassion without action is not enough,'' Mrs. Clinton bellowed, as the crowd erupted in applause.</p>
        <p>''We have to hear the real tune that's being played,'' she added.</p>
