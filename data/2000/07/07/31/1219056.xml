        <p>On Feb. 4, the ABC News correspondent John Stossel hosted a report on ''20/20'' that probably surprised many viewers. It made the case that organic food is not necessarily healthier than conventional food -- and might actually be dangerous.</p>
        <p>Citing research he said was commissioned by ABC News, Mr. Stossel said that organic food seemed more likely than conventional food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He also said that conventional produce does not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce, contradicting one of organic food's primary selling points.</p>

        <p>On Feb. 4, the ABC News correspondent John Stossel hosted a report on ''20/20'' that probably surprised many viewers. It made the case that organic food is not necessarily healthier than conventional food -- and might actually be dangerous.</p>
        <p>Citing research he said was commissioned by ABC News, Mr. Stossel said that organic food seemed more likely than conventional food to be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. He also said that conventional produce does not necessarily have more pesticide residue than organic produce, contradicting one of organic food's primary selling points.</p>
        <p>''Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report.</p>
        <p>But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing -- Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia, and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of Georgetown University's Center for Food and Nutrition Policy -- said they never tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC. ABC executives are now looking into whether the statement about produce, a key premise on which Mr. Stossel built his case, was made without any basis in fact.</p>
        <p>''All I agreed to do was test for indications of pathogens,'' Dr. Doyle said. ''I didn't do tests for pesticides.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Crawford said that while he did not test produce for pesticides, he did test chicken -- and found residue on the samples of conventional poultry but not on samples of organic poultry. Those findings were not mentioned in Mr. Stossel's report.</p>
        <p>The doctors' denials were first brought to light by the Environmental Working Group, which supports the consumption of organic produce. Members talked to the doctors after the report. In a letter to Mr. Stossel, the group asked for an explanation.</p>
        <p>The producer of the segment, David W. Fitzpatrick, responded in a letter by saying that the pesticide tests were done and that the results had been forwarded to the Organic Trade Association, a group that spoke in defense of organic produce in the segment. The executive director of the association, Katherine T. DiMatteo, said Friday that the organization had not received results from any tests for pesticide residue on produce.</p>
        <p>Despite being told by the environmentalists of the doctors' denials, ABC showed the report again on July 7. During an on-the-air conversation with Cynthia McFadden, a ''20/20'' anchorwoman, Mr. Stossel said, ''It's logical to worry about pesticide residues, but in our tests, we found none on either organic or regular produce.''</p>
        <p>Last week, ABC News executives still could not address the questions raised in February. They, at first said pesticide tests were performed on produce by Dr. Crawford. Told that Dr. Crawford maintains he did not do such testing, they later released a statement saying they would look into the matter and ''if a mistake was made, we will correct it.'' Mr. Stossel had no comment and Mr. Fitzpatrick was on assignment in Africa and unavailable.</p>
