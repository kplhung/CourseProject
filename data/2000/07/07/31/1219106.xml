        <p>In its eagerness to end what it sees as a cycle of dependency among New York City's welfare population, the Giuliani administration has made it harder for the poor to get food stamps and Medicaid, two federal entitlements that are not subject to work requirements. The administration has converted more than half the city's welfare offices into ''job centers.'' But as the city conceded in court last year, workers at the job centers have illegally denied or discouraged people from applying for food and medical assistance.</p>
        <p>A class-action lawsuit was filed in 1998 on behalf of poor New Yorkers who had sought help at  the job centers. The plaintiffs charged that city workers were impermissibly blocking them from getting food stamps and Medicaid in an effort to prune the welfare rolls.

        <p>In its eagerness to end what it sees as a cycle of dependency among New York City's welfare population, the Giuliani administration has made it harder for the poor to get food stamps and Medicaid, two federal entitlements that are not subject to work requirements. The administration has converted more than half the city's welfare offices into ''job centers.'' But as the city conceded in court last year, workers at the job centers have illegally denied or discouraged people from applying for food and medical assistance.</p>
        <p>A class-action lawsuit was filed in 1998 on behalf of poor New Yorkers who had sought help at  the job centers. The plaintiffs charged that city workers were impermissibly blocking them from getting food stamps and Medicaid in an effort to prune the welfare rolls. In a ruling made public last  week, Judge William Pauley III of Federal District Court refused to lift an injunction imposed last year that prevents the city from creating more job centers until it corrects the problem of improper denials.</p>
        <p>Federal welfare law allows the city to set strict work standards and essentially discourage people from applying for cash benefits. But the law requires that the poor be allowed to apply for food stamps and medical benefits without delay. Federal officials rightly see these benefits not as welfare but as aid to help the working poor stay independent.</p>
        <p>However, the city's approach seems to view any safety-net assistance, even food for pregnant women, as encouraging dependency. As Jason Turner, commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, testified last year: ''I count food stamps as being part of welfare. You're better off without either one.'' His philosophy seems to have carried over to city workers who wrongly view diverting people from food aid as part of their job.</p>
        <p>Evidence presented in court last year showed that the switch to job centers resulted in sharp declines in applicants who received benefits. Judge Pauley found ''systemwide failures'' as a result of the welfare office conversion, and worse, ''a culture of improper deterrence at job centers'' that drove the needy away.</p>
        <p>The city's lawyers say more staff training and monitoring have been put in place. But the judge found no reliable records to show better performance. If the city wants to move forward with its welfare-to-work plan, it should drop this costly court fight, seek a quick settlement and redouble its efforts to make sure city workers are helping poor people get food and medical care even as they are prodded to find jobs.</p>
