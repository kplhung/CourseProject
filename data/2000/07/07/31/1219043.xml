        <p>Despite the woes she has purportedly suffered resulting from gay and lesbian organizations' expressing opposition to her show, Dr. Laura Schlessinger has failed to see the real picture in her current plight over lost sponsors on her radio program (Business Day, July 24).</p>
        <p>Instead of making any peaceful overtures toward gay men and lesbians, or addressing them with a more amiable term than ''deviant,'' she has continued to attack.</p>
        <p>The message she should have received from the backlash that has caused her to lose nearly 10 percent of her national sponsors is that she ought to sit down with gay and lesbian organizations and politely listen and respond to their concerns over her dehumanizing beliefs. Then she might vow to abate her hate or at the very least see and hear whom she is hurting with her virulent views.</p>
