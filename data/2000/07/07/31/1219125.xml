        <p>The bullies on the bus in Dallas did not know whom they were picking on, they only laughed at the small boy's stutter, his light skin and his clothes, playing the cruel game of childhood.</p>
        <p>His older sister, Tamara, would rush to fight his tormenters, or restrain him from doing so. Kenyon Martin's anger, meanwhile, rose up within him like a sermon. Do not doubt me.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has learned to control his stutter along with his temper. He made himself into the best college basketball player in the country, defying predictions. And today he speaks most eloquently through his actions, powerful, yet gentle.</p>
        <p>Where are those bullies now? ''My mom said she saw a few of them the other day, just doing nothing,'' Martin said with a distant smile and a shrug.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they saw him on television on June 28, the night of the National Basketball Association draft, when the 6-foot-9-inch, 235-pound forward out of the University of Cincinnati dissolved in sobs of relief and vindication after the Nets made him the first overall pick.</p>
        <p>He never thought of leaving college early for the draft, returning to Cincinnati for his senior year specifically to win a national championship. That dream was shattered along with his right fibula on March 9, when he landed awkwardly after colliding with a player on a routine pick in the Conference USA tournament.</p>
        <p>Since then, people questioned Martin's leg and ability to heal, prodded and X-rayed him until his insides glowed, but the Nets hushed all doubters within minutes at the draft. Now Martin feels he must validate their choice when the season begins.</p>
        <p>''They had confidence in me,'' he said. ''I never had a doubt that I would come back and play. A lot of people wondered, but I never had a doubt. I'm going to go out there and work as hard as I can. I don't back down from anybody. No matter who it is.''</p>
        <p>On the basketball court, Martin cuts a menacing figure with his four tattoos, fierce glares, slam dunks, rejected shots and swift sprints. ''People look at him as a mean, tough guy,'' said his best friend, Don Willis, who met him playing Bitty Basketball when they were 7. ''But he's a real tender, sweet person.''</p>
        <p>Martin is also an animal lover, and after his fiancee's boxer flunked out of obedience school, only he could tame and mesmerize the hyperactive dog. He will sit for hours watching ''Big Cat Diaries'' on the Animal Planet cable channel.</p>
        <p>An astute listener with a generous spirit, Martin, 22, is the product of growing up around strong, caring women. ''He is a better person than a basketball player,'' Cincinnati Coach Bob Huggins said of his consensus national player of the year. ''Kenyon's special.''</p>
        <p>Though he is private, his body can be used as a map to his soul, the pictures and letters in different languages all clues to his contrasting personality. On his left arm are thick, black Japanese characters shouting his credo: Never Satisfied. On his right shoulder is his mother's name in thin letters: Lydia.</p>
        <p>Lydia Moore, Tamara Ridley and Martin formed an unbreakable family triangle early on. Ridley, 26, three and a half years older than Martin, mothered him almost immediately, from changing his diaper to fighting his bullies, driving him to basketball games and cooking for him while their mother often worked two jobs. They were inseparable as latchkey children in Dallas and still speak daily.</p>
        <p>''They have a bond that's unbreakable,'' Moore said. ''She's married with two children, but she and her brother, they are joined at the hip.''</p>
        <p>Martin's father, Paul Roby, played basketball at the University of New Mexico, but Martin remembers meeting him only once, when he was in grade school, long after his mother moved the family from Michigan to Texas. When Martin was filling out information forms in college, he told his sister, ''I put you as my dad on my paperwork.''</p>
        <p>Ridley understood. ''I was more like his dad,'' she said. ''I was always fussing after him. I wanted him to succeed.''</p>
        <p>Go to Class, Directly</p>
        <p>If Martin skipped an early morning class at Cincinnati, Huggins used to threaten to call Ridley. Martin went to class.</p>
        <p>''Tamara taught me how to be a strong person, how to overcome things,'' Martin said. ''Both she and my mom did. Just growing up, not letting the bad stuff get between us, making nothing out of something. My mother worked so she could find a way.''</p>
        <p>So did Ridley. She, too, was a single mother, working and going to school to earn her accounting degree. Ridley is now married with a daughter, Tatum, 8, and a son, Darius, 4. Her children are almost exactly the same age difference as she and Martin; they, too, never fight.</p>
        <p>Darius idolizes his uncle, begging for Martin's same tattoos, wearing his jersey, dressing in basketball gear whenever Martin returns to Dallas. The adoration is mutual.</p>
        <p>The day after the draft, Martin arranged to have a three-bedroom house built for his mother and to move his sister and her family into a house on the same block. Ridley currently lives and works out of her mother's home as a wedding consultant.</p>
        <p>''Now,'' said Martin, who will most likely make the rookie maximum of $11.4 million over three years, ''it's their time to relax.''</p>
        <p>Even before he was the provider for the family, Martin offered his sister and mother a sense of calm. ''My sister worries enough for both of us,'' he said. ''I tell her, 'Why worry about things you can't control?' I never do.''</p>
        <p>Mastering an Inner Battle</p>
        <p>It is a perspective that took time to develop, an inner battle he finally mastered on the court. ''When I was young, I would just snap. But I had a coach who told me my attitude wouldn't get me anywhere,'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>That was when Martin was 12 and the shortest player on the team. As he grew, he excelled defensively but was still reluctant to emerge on offense. He went to three high schools in Dallas, including a private school and two public schools. After leaving the private school, the bus ride to the first public school was so far from home that he moved in with his sister and niece to go to Bryan Adams High School.</p>
        <p>Martin was not a top high school prospect when he signed with Cincinnati. ''He was very talented when he came in,'' Huggins said, ''he just didn't have any skills.''</p>
        <p>Martin had not qualified academically to play the first semester at Cincinnati, but kept taking the SAT until he became eligible to join the team in January. By the 14th game of his freshman year, he was starting. Still, he played with upper-class stars, like Danny Fortson and Damon Flint, and averaged only 2.8 points a game.</p>
        <p>''I was not productive at all,'' he said. Nor was he particularly aggressive. ''I didn't want to get fouled because I struggled at the free-throw line.'' As a freshman, he went to the foul line only 32 times in 22 games, and made 10.</p>
        <p>''His mechanics were really bad,'' Huggins said. ''As his mechanics got better and better, he gained more confidence.'' In Martin's sophomore year, he shot 47.6 percent from the line, 50 of 105. His junior year, he made 50 of 89, for 56.2 percent. Last season, he went to the line 206 times and made 141 for 68.4 percent.</p>
        <p>''He's really got a great aptitude for basketball, and he's a great listener,'' Huggins said. ''His last two years he coached the other guys. So much of why Kenyon is so good is that he gets great pleasure in helping other people.''</p>
        <p>'Did I Shoot Too Much?'</p>
        <p>Against DePaul his sophomore year, Martin pulled off a triple-double, with 24 points, 23 rebounds and 10 blocks. Afterward, he approached Huggins. ''Did I shoot too much?'' Martin said.</p>
        <p>Huggins was amazed. ''The guy really wants to win and he's never been caught up in statistics,'' he said. ''When he started getting all the accolades, you wondered if his work ethic would change.''</p>
        <p>It did not. It only intensified. The summer before his senior year, Martin decided he would change his game, that this Cincinnati team would bear his offensive imprint. ''If I could do it in practice,'' Martin said, ''I don't know why I couldn't do it in the game.''</p>
        <p>Martin got in the gym and shot ''until his arm fell off,'' the assistant coach Rod Baker said. He practiced his free throws, his post-up moves, working out with Corey Blount, the former Cincinnati player and six-year N.B.A. forward.</p>
        <p>Martin's single-minded determination to achieve a national championship was why Huggins, too, was devastated when his star went down 3 minutes 4 seconds into Cincinnati's opening-round game against St. Louis in Memphis in the conference tournament.</p>
        <p>''Get my sister,'' Martin said, on his way into the ambulance. Tamara was right behind him. Moore, who would cry any time her son got poked in the eye, was there, too.</p>
        <p>The fracture, like a fault line, led to other disappointing events. The Bearcats did not get a No. 1 seeding in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and they lost in the second round. Martin's wedding was to be in Cincinnati in April. Instead, his fiancee of two years, Fatimah Conley, withdrew from her classes at Xavier to tend to him.</p>
        <p>Because of their classes and his basketball schedule, they rarely spent many days in a row together, but then the injury brought them closer. ''I've known him for three years and he never complains,'' Conley said. ''If he didn't have any money, he didn't complain. He never once complained about his leg. Me, coming from suburbia, we complain a lot. I'm a worry-holic, always wondering how it's going to be tomorrow, a year from now. He tells me, 'Things are going to be how they're going to be.' ''</p>
        <p>Wedding Plans</p>
        <p>The two plan to get married before the season.</p>
        <p>Once she and Martin find a house in New Jersey, Conley plans to finish work toward her undergraduate chemistry degree, perhaps at Columbia or New York University.</p>
        <p>''I know the season is going to be very hectic and he'll be away a lot,'' she said. ''So it's important for me to have my own life.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, they have been living in Santa Monica, Calif., since late April. Martin's agent, Dan Fegan, arranged for him to rehabilitate at the Kerlan-Jobe Institute and Martin has been working out every morning for three hours, shooting, improving his strength and quickness, and following Nets team doctors' advice not to scrimmage until next month.</p>
        <p>''My confidence is at an all-time high, even though I'm not playing,'' Martin said. ''When I get in games, I know I can play with anybody.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, Martin attended Shaw's Summer League in Boston with the Nets, learning some plays and sitting on the bench watching free agents and rookies who will most likely never be his teammates. It was torture.</p>
        <p>The leg, he said, will be healed by Oct. 2, when the Nets begin training camp. He does not see pressure in being anointed a savior for a Nets team historically tagged by injuries and underachieving. Rather he is looking forward to running the floor in the up-tempo offense of the Nets' new coach, Byron Scott.</p>
        <p>''I love playing, I don't look at anything as pressure,'' Martin said. ''When I'm on the court, I'm so relaxed, I'm more nervous when I talk to somebody than when I am on the court, in front of thousands of people.''</p>
        <p>But at least with one group, his words flow easily.</p>
        <p>After he left Boston, last week, Martin stopped in Cincinnati because he had promised an elementary school class he would return. To read to them.</p>
