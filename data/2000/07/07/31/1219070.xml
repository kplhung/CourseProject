        <p>When Orson Welles completed ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' in 1942, he considered the film superior to his previous movie and masterpiece, ''Citizen Kane.'' But a disastrous preview screening before a teenage audience led RKO Studios to take ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' out of Welles's hands and delete more than 40 minutes of the saga of a wealthy Midwestern family at the turn of the century. Welles said he never recovered.</p>
        <p>''They destroyed 'Ambersons,' '' Welles remarked years later. ''And it destroyed me.''</p>
        <p>Whether the studio's editing of the film shattered Welles's career or whether he himself contributed to his downfall, the event remains a turning point in the elusive career of a director, actor and writer who was, like ''The Magnificent Ambersons,'' brilliant and flawed. The outtakes of the film were left in vaults and either turned to dust or were burned because of a shortage of space.</p>
        <p>''We've never seen the film the way Welles intended it to be seen, and there's always been a sense of loss here about those 40 minutes,'' said Ted R. Hartley, chairman of RKO Pictures. ''What we now want to do is complete our homage and obligation to Welles.''</p>
        <p>The result is that the original 131-minute shooting script is being made into a four-hour mini-series on the A&amp;E cable network (the additional material will come from the Booth Tarkington novel of the same name,  on which the film was based). The miniseries, directed by Alfonso Arau (''Like Water for Chocolate''), will be released as a film in Europe, where Welles is probably even more popular than in the United States. Production of the remake starts in Dublin in August, and the television series and film are to be released early next year.</p>
        <p>What's unusual about this plan is that television rarely if ever seeks to remake a film that failed commercially like ''The Magnificent Ambersons.'' Recently, George Clooney was the executive producer for and acted in a CBS remake of the 1964 drama ''Fail-Safe,'' about a United States bomber accidentally ordered to attack Moscow with a nuclear weapon. But that original movie was a success. ''The Magnificent Ambersons,'' on the other hand, was given only a modest release and lost $625,000 at the box office, making it a big commercial flop. Nonetheless, the edited film is viewed by some film scholars as a dazzling but sometimes odd work. Other scholars say that the film's main interest is as an integral piece of the puzzle in the long decline of  Welles, who was 27 when he made ''Citizen Kane'' and 29 when he completed ''The Magnificent Ambersons.'' He died at age of 70 in 1985, a tragic artist who spent his final years appearing in television commercials, narrating documentaries, appearing as a guest on comedy shows hosted by Dick Cavett and Merv Griffin and struggling in vain to make movies.</p>
        <p>What led to the remake of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was a meeting that Mr. Hartley held in his office in Beverly Hills with two of the three producers of the mini-series, Norman Stephens and James Kirkwood. The third producer is Jonas Bauer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hartley told them that RKO,  by then virtually dormant, was looking in its archives to remake some of its classic films for television and movie theaters. Among the films owned by the studio are ''Suspicion,'' ''Gunga Din'' and ''Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,'' as well as ''The Magnificent Ambersons.''</p>
        <p>''We asked to see the complete script of 'Ambersons,' '' Mr. Stephens said. ''They dug it out. We fell in love with it. Then we went back to the book, which the original screenplay tracks very closely. We added scenes from the book.''</p>
        <p>The 1942 film starred Joseph Cotten, Tim Holt, Dolores Costello, Anne Baxter and Agnes Moorehead. It was based on the 1918 Pulitzer Prize-winning Tarkington novel about a patrician Midwestern family facing decline and despair with the arrival of the automobile. Welles's Mercury Theater had initially adapted the novel as a radio play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arau took over the mini-series project recently when the original director, Herbert Ross, dropped out because of illness.</p>
        <p>The cast is tentatively set to include Madeleine Stowe, Jennifer Tilly, James Cromwell, Jonathan Rhys-Myers and Thora Birch. Contracts are expected to be signed in the next few days. The cost of the production is about $14 million, relatively high for a television drama. Most of the financing comes from an Italian company, the DeAngelis Group as well as A&amp;E.</p>
        <p>''The original film was mutilated, but we have the original script,'' Mr. Arau said. ''That script was very faithful to the novel. The challenge is to make the film based on that script.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arau said the notion of remaking an Orson Welles movie ''was not very attractive to me.'' He added: ''It's almost like a lack of respect. But at the same time it's based on screenplay by Welles, not the movie. It's a great, great family drama. And I look at it as if I were doing a classic like 'Romeo and Juliet' or 'The Miser.' I don't feel as if I'm stepping in Shakespeare's shoes or Moliere's.''</p>
        <p>Like the producers, Mr. Arau said he believed that ''Ambersons'' was not dated and hoped that it would stir contemporary audiences.</p>
        <p>''The novel and film were a critical and intelligent view of the upper class at the turn of the century,'' he said. ''It showed how all these huge fortunes, which they thought of as their divine right, collapsed with the advent of the automobile.''</p>
        <p>''Well look what's happening now at the millennium: new fortunes are being made because of the Internet and computers. Old fortunes are dying. The world is changing radically. Values are changing. Just like 100 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Throughout his life, Welles viewed ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' -- that is, his original version -- as his masterpiece. In ''This Is Orson Welles'' (First Da Capo Press), a series of interviews with the director Peter Bogdanovich, Welles said he had once reluctantly seen the edited film in Paris with Andre Gide.</p>
        <p>''It was most unpleasant,'' Welles said. ''I would have been happier never to know and just hear what they had done to it. For five or six reels things weren't so bad. I thought: 'Well, that isn't so bad. They didn't do too many things -- only a few stupid little cuts.' And then all hell broke loose. It was a much better picture than 'Kane.' If they had just left it as it was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hartley, the RKO chairman, said that the company initially considered turning the drama into a feature film. But this would have meant making a three-hour film costing anywhere from $50 million to $60 million. ''It would not be a good investment,'' he said. ''The odds are you would not find a big enough audience to make a feature film set in this period.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he said, making television films is much cheaper than producing feature films -- partly because of lower salary and production costs. Moreover, the films can be played numerous times on A&amp;E to recoup the investment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hartley said that when he joined RKO nine years ago, the staff there began searching through vaults for footage from various films. They found a film can that was thought to be the footage from ''Ambersons.'' ''There was this momentary thrill,'' Mr. Hartley said. ''But when we opened the can the film was unrecognizable. It had fallen apart.''</p>
        <p>But Robert L. Carringer, author of ''The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction'' (University of California Press, 1993) said that outtakes of the film were burned because of a shortage of storage space.</p>
        <p>In his authoritative book on the film, Mr. Carringer said that Welles himself shared considerable blame for the outcome of the edited film. ''It was a string of questionable judgments and rash actions on his part that paved the way to the film's undoing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This included Welles's decision to accept a proposal by the government's Office of Inter-American Affairs, run by Nelson Rockefeller and John Hay Whitney, to make a film in Brazil to foster relations with Latin America. Welles left ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' in the hands of subordinates. ''When serious difficulties did arise, there was no one to take charge on Welles's behalf, and his surrender of the right of final cut left the studio free to act as it chose.''</p>
        <p>RKO took over the editing of the film while Welles was in Rio. This was after a devastating preview in Pomona, Calif., before a largely teenage audience that had just seen the wartime musical ''The Fleet's In.'' Welles himself had ordered cuts and editing changes before the preview -- including an almost explicit Oedipal relationship in the movie. So what the audience members saw was a slow-paced period drama that bored them.</p>
        <p>RKO's studio president, George Schaefer, gave Robert Wise, who edited ''Citizen Kane,'' the responsibility of cutting ''The Magnificent Ambersons.'' Mr. Wise later directed such classics as ''The Sound of Music.'' Forty-three minutes of the Welles film were cut. The film was tested again and virtually abandoned by the studio. Mr. Schaefer was soon deposed as studio chief, and Welles's contract with RKO was dropped. ''It soon became clear that he would never be entrusted with a major production again on his own terms,'' said Mr. Carringer.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Wise said he still recalled the first preview. ''It was a disaster -- the audience laughed at the wrong places,'' he said. ''It was terribly long.'' Mr. Wise, editor of the original version, said that the studio asked him to trim the movie. ''We previewed it again, and it still wasn't right,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After further cuts, and the addition of one scene that Mr. Wise himself directed while Welles was in Brazil, the film was played before another preview audience. ''There were no bad laughs,'' Mr. Wise said. ''And that's the film that went out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wise said it was absurd that Welles felt '''Ambersons'' had destroyed his career. ''All wrong,'' he said. ''It was just a bad time for that film. War had been declared. And audiences were not interested in the problems of the Amberson family in Indianapolis at the turn of the century.''</p>
        <p>Allen Sabinson, senior president for programming at A&amp;E, said he hoped that the cable network's largely adult audience would turn to the new version of a film that may only stir vague memories now. ''It's been more than 50 years since the edited film was released,'' Mr. Sabinson said. ''And there's a tragic story behind that film. 'The Magnificent Ambersons' was truly the passion of Orson Welles. And his version was never released.''</p>
