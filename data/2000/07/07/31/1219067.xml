        <p>IF executives of e-commerce companies thought they were having a hard time finding employees last year, this year's Summer of the Dot-Com Shakeout has brought even more misery to the group.</p>
        <p>The number of available workers has grown, but as employees jump off sinking ships or swim away from ones already capsized, they are being much more selective about where they dock next. Gone are the days when Internet retailers could dangle 10,000 stock options, utter a few words about revolutionizing the process of buying gravel, say, and then get a prospective employee to sign on for a galley slave's salary and 16-hour days in close quarters with 24-year-olds and their Labradors.</p>
        <p>Now the words ''stock options'' and ''revolutionize'' are more likely to set a job applicant's eyes to rolling. Recruiters and executives say employees now want two things from prospective employers: a good salary and, perhaps more important, good prospects for corporate longevity. In the short term, at least, that means that traditional companies with Internet divisions could have a substantial advantage in the recruiting wars, thereby putting additional pressure on their dot-com competitors.</p>
        <p>One company that has benefited greatly from the consolidation among Internet merchants is BlueLight.com, Kmart's online store. The company successfully recruited employees from Petstore.com, an online retailer that was recently purchased by Pets.com, as well the Internet Shopping Network, which merged with Styleclick.com earlier this year.</p>
        <p>''At least 50 resumes per week are pouring in from Reel.com, Homewarehouse.com and other dot-coms that have either failed or are failing,'' said David Karraker, a BlueLight spokesman.</p>
        <p>Homewarehouse.com, an online retailer of home improvement goods, shut down operations earlier this summer, while Reel.com recently stopped selling DVD's, videos and other goods on its site and scaled back to an information site about the movie industry.</p>
        <p>Pippa Manley, BlueLight's director of human resources, said the shifting fortunes of Internet companies had saved BlueLight money, because she now relies less on pricey corporate recruiters to fill jobs. ''These are very inexpensive hires for me, because if I find them, I don't have to pay 25 percent of a person's salary to a headhunter,'' Ms. Manley said.</p>
        <p>As for their demands, Ms. Manley said people were less eager to discuss stock options as part of their compensation, even though BlueLight's business is structured so that it could eventually sell its shares to the public. ''A lot of people are saying, 'I don't care about the options -- let's talk salary,' '' she said. ''So there's been more negotiations on that point.</p>
        <p>Ms. Manley said such negotiations were frustrating, because she still saw good potential for BlueLight to have successful stock offerings someday. ''But then again,'' she said,  ''I haven't been through what they've been through, so it's easy for me to say.''</p>
        <p>Kimberly Lyons, BlueLight's manager of marketing partnerships, joined the company in June from Xoom.com, a unit of NBCi, NBC's Internet division. ''Options weren't a big priority at all because of what happened at NBC,'' Ms. Lyons said.</p>
        <p>She noted that the NBCi stock reached $85 on its first day of trading last November, but has plummeted since. (The shares closed at $22 on Friday.) ''So I was more aggressive on salary,'' Ms. Lyons said. ''Other companies I interviewed with were still giving low salaries and trying to compensate with umpteen options, which was so unappealing.''</p>
        <p>Compensation aside, Kmart's online operation had its own appeal, Ms. Lyons said: ''I also knew that by coming here, I'd be getting offline experience, which is important. And I'd be exposed to more than a desk made out of a door, or bagel Fridays, so that was very attractive.''</p>
        <p>Spike Anderson, a principal with Monday Technology Solutions, an executive recruitment firm in San Francisco, said he, too, had recently been hearing job seekers express a preference for Internet sites that are affiliated with traditional companies. ''They're hedging their bets,'' he said. ''They might not get as many stock options, but the chances are they'll at least be worth something.''</p>
        <p>Presumably, such sentiments would make it more difficult for Internet-only companies to compete, because they cannot afford to increase their salaries to match those offered by traditional companies. William A. Chen, chief executive of OnePage.com, an Internet-only company that allows users to assemble several sites on one screen, said such a prospect was more a theory than a fact. ''Over time, there may be a decline in what pure plays can afford to pay,'' he said. ''But for now, it's still a race to pay whatever we can, especially to the top people.''</p>
        <p>If the emphasis continues to be placed on salary -- and bricks-and-mortar pedigree -- instead of equity, Mr. Chen said, ''we might have to spend more to hire better people, but then just not hire as many people to do all the work.''</p>
        <p>Myteam.com, an information and commerce site for people involved in youth sports programs, recently bought air time on a Boston-area radio station to advertise open positions.</p>
        <p>Elliot Katzman, the company's chief executive, said Myteam, too, had recently seen an increase in the number of candidates who stressed salary over stock options. But he said that change could be attributed to the Internet labor shortage, which has been so protracted that recruiters are more actively lobbying workers at traditional companies, where people are less prone to jump at equity-heavy compensation packages.</p>
        <p>''So we've had to have more conversations about salary lately,'' Mr. Katzman said. ''But it still has to work in the context of the company, and this is a start-up, so you have to be very careful about how you spend money.''</p>
        <p>Compensation packages with stock options also motivate workers ''to build the company's value,'' Mr. Katzman said. ''Everyone's got to have some skin in the game for this to work.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, traditional companies with Web operations are enjoying the fact that dot-com executives are asking to work for them, rather than raiding them. ''We take some consolation in knowing we've populated the dot-coms,'' said Christopher J. McCormick, senior vice president of L. L. Bean, which has lost senior-level executives to Send.com, Diamonds.com, Dell.com and eToys, among others. ''But I've got to tell you, it hurt morale for people to see folks leave for stock packages worth a zillion dollars.''</p>
        <p>More recently, the tide has turned, Mr. McCormick said, noting for instance that the company's vice president for operations, Mike Perkins, recently joined L. L. Bean from Amazon.com. ''And we've gotten dozens of resumes from people at dot-coms who want out because their stock is underwater, and they see Bean's staying power and the quality of life here in Maine,'' Mr.McCormick said. ''I do get some pleasure out of this, to be honest.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 2, 2000, Wednesday  The E-Commerce Report in Business Day on Monday about the migration of workers from Internet start-ups to more established companies misstated the Friday stock price for NBC Internet Inc.
