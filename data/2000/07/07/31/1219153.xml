        <p>''At this critical point in our growth,'' Ms. Gardner said, referring to the expansion of Kohl's into markets like metropolitan New York, ''we felt we needed to explore other options.''</p>
        <p>The print portion of the Kohl's account remains in house. McCann-Erickson is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
