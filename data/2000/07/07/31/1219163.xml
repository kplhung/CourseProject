        <p>BRONX: ROBBERY TURNS FATAL  A man fell to his death from a seventh-story window yesterday after two men robbed his apartment and pushed him out, the police said. The robbers forced their way into the man's apartment, at the Gun Hill Houses on East Gun Hill Road in the Olinville section, around 3:40 p.m., relatives who were there told the police. The robbers fled after pushing the man out the window, said Detective Edward Reuss, a police spokesman. The victim, a man in his 40's whose name was not released pending notification of his family, landed in an outdoor stairway in front of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene. The police said they did not know what was taken from the apartment.</p>

        <p>NEW WATER SYSTEMS AT FAIRS  A year after the state's worst E. coli outbreak, fairgrounds that had been using untreated drinking water are revamping their water systems to meet new state requirements. New water treatment systems were installed at some sites, like the Washington County Fairgrounds in Easton, where hundreds were sickened and two people were killed by last summer's outbreak. The Chenango, Genesee, Tioga and Wyoming county fairs now use only water from municipal supplies. And the Madison, Orleans and Washington county fairs have new water systems, said a State Health Department spokeswoman.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: H.M.O. DENIALS OVERTURNED  More than 300 denials of coverage for medical procedures by health maintenance organizations were overturned during the first year of a state appeals process by outside medical experts. They overturned 331 denials but upheld the organizations' decisions in 329 cases. New York residents filed more than 20,000 internal H.M.O. appeals in 1999 -- the first step before external review. Information about the review process is available by calling the Insurance Department at (800) 400-8882.</p>

        <p>POINT PLEASANT BEACH: CHURCH MONEY TAKEN  A church deacon and retired Rutgers University police officer has been charged with stealing $189,957 from the Sunday collection plate over five years, the authorities said.

        <p>FREEHOLD: AUTO INSPECTION DATA  Six workers at the Freehold motor vehicle inspection station apparently scanned bar codes on soda cans instead of using the bar codes on vehicle registration cards, state officials said. James Weinstein, the transportation commissioner, said the soda can information did not affect the inspection of the motor vehicles, but could pose problems for all the data collected by the system, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported yesterday. Mr. Weinstein said he had no idea why the employees would do such a thing. Officials at Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group, which runs the state inspection program, told the newspaper that employees were trying to bypass a fault in the computer system that caused it to have problems reading the cards and forced employees to enter the 17-digit vehicle identification number manually.</p>
