        <p>WHAT is a Vivendi?'' That is what some bewildered Wall Street media analysts were asking last month when Vivendi S.A. announced that it was buying the Seagram Company for what was then $34 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Many of those analysts are still trying to figure out what Vivendi is -- or at least what it is up to with Seagram. And their puzzlement has made them reluctant to offer investors guidance on whether to buy or avoid the shares of both companies.</p>
        <p>That reluctance has translated into listless stock prices for both Seagram and Vivendi. Seagram shares are trading well below the premium Vivendi has agreed to pay. And in Europe, Vivendi shares have dropped roughly 27 percent since rumors of the deal first circulated.</p>
        <p>In the United States, a core group of analysts say they have received little insight into the economics of the merger between Seagram, a liquor and media company based in Montreal, and Vivendi, a diversified French company that has stakes in the water, environmental, industrial, telecommunications and entertainment businesses.</p>
        <p>''The folks at Vivendi have gotten very ham-handed advice from their bankers,'' said Christopher Dixon, media analyst at PaineWebber, who is one of those frustrated by how little guidance he said Vivendi had been giving to analysts and institutional investors. Lazard Freres in Paris represented Vivendi in the merger, while Goldman, Sachs represented Seagram. Both investment banks, and the merging companies, declined to commment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon and other analysts say that Vivendi, which until the announcement of this deal was not well known in the United States, had been adding and spinning off assets at a dizzying pace. This makes the company's financial performance and growth prospects hard to calculate, even before the Seagram deal. And since the deal, they say, Vivendi has done little to explain the value of acquiring Seagram or to articulate a growth plan.</p>
        <p>The communications gap stems in part from the trend toward global mergers. Investment analysts in this country are accustomed to receiving detailed financial data from each partner in a merger. They expected Vivendi and Seagram to provide the data that would enable them to make projections. While some of those figures are public, much of Vivendi's data remains veiled, an analyst said, because ''French accounting rules do not necessarily disclose how things are being consolidated.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, such projections are produced by enthusiastic and aggressive investment bankers and chief executives eager to consummate a merger. Whether or not the future proves them accurate, they are at least a basis for analysts to start building their own estimates.</p>
        <p>But in this case, there is little to build upon. More than a month after the deal was announced, on June 20, there are few specifics, according to several analysts. ''If you call the company, they will tell you they are anticipating 40 percent growth,'' one analyst said. ''But they don't tell you how they will get that growth. They tell you it will come from telephone and entertainment, and then tell you they will get back to you.''</p>
        <p>An executive close to Vivendi and its bankers at Lazard Freres responded that Vivendi had been forthcoming with financial data and that much of the information was publicly available. But an analyst pointed out that because Vivendi was now projecting faster growth than the company's historical growth rates, past data was not all that enlightening.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem in global deals lies in logistics and geography. When Vivendi announced the purchase on June 20, it was 8:45 a.m. in Paris -- 2:45 a.m. in New York -- an hour when few analysts are glued to their television sets or computer screens. Vivendi officials flew to New York that day and held a news conference. But a subsequent conference call with analysts seemed only to annoy Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''They came on the phone and never really described the deal,'' Mr. Dixon recalled. ''They just took questions.'' It was a stark contrast to the custom of executives at American companies, who typically make detailed presentations of merger plans.</p>
        <p>Several weeks later, Vivendi and Seagram held a conference call. This time, Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr. fielded questions solo for 45 minutes, because Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, was late, compounding Wall Street analysts' irritation. Ed Hatch, an entertainment analyst at SG Cowen, said, ''The call was a big feel-good meeting, but it was totally useless.''</p>
        <p>Some believe that the scarcity of data is having a negative effect on the two companies' stock prices.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the deal, each Seagram share would be exchanged for 0.8 Vivendi share -- assuming Vivendi's stock remains below $96.69.</p>
        <p>Based on Friday's closing price in Paris for Vivendi of 86.5 euros a share, or $79.84, the 0.8-to-1 ratio means that Seagram theoretically should be trading at $63.87. But Seagram shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed Friday at $56.50 -- or an 11.5 percent discount to the deal's valuation.</p>
        <p>''Since the merger is expected to close by the end of the year, that discount could be compelling for investors if they could have confidence in the Vivendi story,'' said Scott Davis, who follows Seagram for First Union Securities. But, he added, ''the information on Vivendi is still forthcoming.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon of PaineWebber attributes the two stocks' performance to the lack of guidance from the companies. ''The net result,'' he said, ''is that everyone has shrugged their shoulders, walked away and said, 'Who needs this now?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon is among the shruggers. ''If you are going to invest in the entertainment industry,'' he said, ''remember Woody Allen's famous line, 'The secret to success is showing up.' They haven't even done that.''</p>
