        <p>Conventional wisdom says most Americans are happy in these best of economic times. Jobs are plentiful. Wages are increasing. Inflation is low. And even the traditionally hard-core unemployed are finding work.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is happy. And a lot of those who are unhappy are women.</p>
        <p>A nationwide series of focus groups conducted jointly by leading Democratic and Republican pollsters largely contradicts conventional wisdom and could change the way the presidential race is viewed.</p>
        <p>The focus groups show that ''women are largely pessimistic about the present state of the nation,'' and, to a surprising degree, feel they are not benefiting significantly from the improved economy. They feel they are working longer and longer hours just to make ends meet, and that the increasing demands of work leave them less and less time to spend with their families.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the focus group participants expressed deep concern over the moral direction of the country, and what they perceived as the absence of a solid sense of values being passed on to the nation's children.</p>
        <p>The economy may be breaking statistical records, but it has not been able to offset this deep discontent.</p>
        <p>''I think women are asking, 'What if this is as good as it gets?' '' said Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster who is surveying American women in the joint project with Republican pollster Linda DiVall.</p>
        <p>From coast to coast, at gatherings of women from widely varied backgrounds, the focus group leaders heard heartfelt and poignant expressions of frustration, disappointment and even discouragement.</p>
        <p>A common theme was that while there certainly were big winners in the booming economy, there were many more ordinary families that were working hard but barely holding on from week to week.</p>
        <p>A detailed report on the focus groups said women were worried about their children growing up in environments that are entirely different from their own backgrounds. It said: ''With the rise of single parent and dual income households, they are concerned about children's lack of guidance and their loss of appropriate role models. With parents busy meeting financial demands, participants believe children have few sources from which to learn family values or a sense of morality besides from television and the streets.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lake and Ms. DiVall organized the focus groups and are conducting a series of nonpartisan national polls to determine -- as the election season unfolds -- what issues are of most concern to women. The project is called ''Women's Voices 2000'' and is sponsored by the Center for Policy Alternatives, a nonpartisan public policy group, and Lifetime Television, a cable network that bills itself as ''Television for Women.''</p>
        <p>The report on the focus groups will be released tomorrow at a press briefing in Philadelphia, where the Republican National Convention is being held. ''We're hoping the candidates see this as a wake-up call,'' said Carole Black, president and chief executive of Lifetime. ''They need to hear what women are saying.''</p>
        <p>Some of the most heart-wrenching comments at the focus groups came from African-American women. They shared the concerns of other participants but also spoke movingly about the personal impact of violence and deteriorating values, and their very real fear that their children -- their sons, especially -- might not even survive adolescence.</p>
        <p>''It was very sobering and very depressing,'' said Ms. DiVall. ''A lot of them feel they are doing absolutely the best they can to protect their kids, but it's the outside environment that is pressing in on them and they feel they have no control over it.''</p>
        <p>Politicians have tended to argue economic issues and values issues as if they were separate categories that could be addressed independently. But the women who participated in the focus groups seemed to be saying that economic pressures made it more difficult for their families to deal with the many outside influences shaping the values of their children.</p>
        <p>The interrelationship of values and the economy is a difficult theme for politicians to articulate. But it is close to the core of the real world of working Americans.</p>
