        <p>DICK CHENEY</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from transcripts of interviews yesterday with Dick Cheney on ABC's ''This Week and NBC's ''Meet the Press'' concerning his voting record on education, gun control and South Africa :</p>
        <p>'' I probably cast 2,000, 3,000 votes. I don't know how many votes I cast over ten years. It was a bunch. As did anybody else who'd served in the Congress as well, too. And we analyzed the overall packages, but you can't go through and look at every single vote, and I'm perfectly happy to defend my record. . . .</p>
        <p>I would vote today to leave the Department of Education in place. I opposed it originally when we first got into that. I think my general view on education is that it's primarily a local and state concern -- that's where the bulk of the funding lies -- but, as Governor Bush has made clear, we've got a fair amount of money we are spending at the federal level today, Title I funds, and that there ought to be accountability with those funds. There hasn't been in the past.</p>
        <p>I don't think there needs to be any big increase in education funding. I'm sure we can find some individual programs we could true up, but I think overall  the key is to spend what we're spending now wisely. . . .</p>
        <p>I'm a strong believer in the Second Amendment and support it. I think the key question, again if we come back to the trivial aspect of the debates that rage in Washington now, it's what we're going to do in the future. And the fact of the matter is I'm perfectly happy to support Governor Bush's proposals with respect to trigger locks for handguns, for example, with respect to prosecuting people guilty of gun crimes. This administration's allowed prosecutions to fall 46 percent. Those are important kinds of questions. . . .</p>
        <p>Well, certainly I would have loved to have had Nelson Mandela released. I don't know anybody who was for keeping him in prison. Again, this was a resolution of the U.S. Congress, so it wasn't as though if we passed it, he was going to be let out of prison. It had another provision in it. It also required the recognition of the A.N.C., the African National Congress, which at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and begetting violence in South Africa.</p>
        <p>My recollection is the Reagan administration proposed it,  and I supported the administra- tion. ''</p>
