        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My friend Gabor Koranyi was visiting New York from Hungary recently and took the subway from Manhattan to his hosts' home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, one night. It was after 2 a.m., and when he left the station he lost his way. The streets were deserted, and although he stopped a few cabs to ask directions, or to take him to his destination, none of the drivers knew how to get there.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My friend Gabor Koranyi was visiting New York from Hungary recently and took the subway from Manhattan to his hosts' home in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, one night. It was after 2 a.m., and when he left the station he lost his way. The streets were deserted, and although he stopped a few cabs to ask directions, or to take him to his destination, none of the drivers knew how to get there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koranyi didn't want to wake his hosts, but finally realized he had his cell phone. He called a friend in Budapest, where it was nearly 9 a.m. The friend logged on to the Internet and in no time found Mr. Koranyi's location on MapQuest. Then he found the Greenpoint destination and step by step guided his friend to his hosts' house.</p>

        <p>Scene: Elevator in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>Dramatis Personae: Couple with daughter about 4, and son, about 3.</p>
        <p>Observer: Carlos Montorfano.</p>
        <p>Mother tells the obviously unhappy little girl that they will go to the zoo later and begins to describe the many beautiful things to be seen at the museum.</p>
        <p>Little girl, forcefully: ''I'm not going arting!''</p>
        <p>A correspondent, who wishes to remain anonymous, drove her husband to a Manhattan hospital where he was to undergo brain surgery. After a long time, she was finally allowed to see him. With his eyes still closed and his speech somewhat labored, he managed to communicate. His first words: ''You have to move the car.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Benno H. ter Kuile moved to Leiden, the Netherlands, last fall after eight years in Manhattan. Swapping recollections with friends on a recent visit, he recalled an overheard conversation as ''most typical of New York.''</p>
        <p>Scene: An entrance to Central Park on a not very cold day. An obviously new father tries to put an extra blanket on a baby in a carriage.</p>
        <p>Mother (exasperated): ''I'm a doctor and I know this baby does not need another blanket.''</p>
        <p>Father (in jest): ''I'm a lawyer, and if this baby catches a cold, I'll sue the pants off your sweet behind.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Understand I'm approaching geezer status, I'm not much of a techno-anything and I also happen to be in the highly stressed ad business. When I creak out of my cab at my Midtown hotel about noon, after flying in from St. Louis, I usually have numerous things to do, meetings to get to, and very little time to organize any of it. Recently, I didn't need anything except my glasses, pen, mints, briefcase and my cell phone, to get a call from a friend who was joining me later in the day. After a hasty bath, I collected all the necessary items and sped off to my destination.</p>
        <p>When late afternoon came around, I anxiously awaited my friend's call and thought I'd check Brooks Brothers' annual sale to kill time. Still no call. My anxiety level up a notch or two, I drifted over to Paul Stuart. I couldn't imagine what had happened to my always reliable friend and finally decided to make the call myself. I reached into my  breast pocket and pulled out the hotel room's television remote control.</p>
        <p>Of course, I later griped to my finally found friend, ''Ever notice how these cell phones never seem to work when you want them to?''</p>

        <p>PRAYER FOR A FAMILY VACATION</p>
        <p>May the Triple-A cards go unneeded</p>
        <p>And our car remain in one piece.</p>
        <p>May it circumvent stain and collision</p>
        <p>That could threaten the terms of its lease.</p>
        <p>May the kids in their car seats cease fire</p>
        <p>Refraining from hair pulls and bites.</p>
        <p>May their bladders remain large and empty</p>
        <p>At least till a rest stop's in sight.</p>
        <p>May the beach house have two separate bedrooms</p>
        <p>And a fridge with a place for some ice.</p>
        <p>May the bedding not slump toward the corner</p>
        <p>And be free from all visible lice.</p>
        <p>May the sun be not shy nor elusive</p>
        <p>May the sea be not wild, just wet.</p>
        <p>May the sharks keep respectable distance</p>
        <p>And the jellyfish season not yet.</p>
        <p>May nothing expensive get broken</p>
        <p>May our laughter outweigh all the tears.</p>
        <p>If not, may our memories filter,</p>
        <p>So we do it all over next year.</p>
        <p>JOAN URBAN</p>
        <p>Dr. William K. Kopp was reared in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, and when he visited his son and daughter-in-law's new apartment in Brooklyn Heights, he realized it was only a block from the Hotel St. George and its huge indoor pool, where he occasionally swam as a child. The proximity  brought to mind a lesson he had learned in 1950 as an 11-year-old. After swimming and dressing he was waiting for friends to take the subway home when an older boy approached, pointed a knife at him and said he needed money for his sick mother. The boy added he hated to do this but his mother needed medicine badly. If his victim came back in two weeks, though, he would pay him back.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kopp said he did go back and the boy was indeed there -- to rob him again. ''How early we learn about life in a big city,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>After a long day traveling to and from a client's office in New Jersey, I was trying to make my way to the West Side Highway and got tangled in Lincoln Tunnel traffic on Ninth Avenue. Stalled there for some time, I noticed a sign that advertised Manganaro's foods. There was a phone number displayed, so I took out my cell phone and called in a sandwich order, explaining my pain at the traffic and unhappiness without food. The owner asked me if I was in the car that was double-parked in front of the building. Indeed I was, I said, and she offered to bring the sandwich to my car. Within minutes it appeared. Somehow, the traffic tangle and the rest of the drive to the Bronx seemed almost relaxing.</p>

        <p>CALORIES</p>
        <p>Everyone watches calories</p>
        <p>Tell me how that can be</p>
        <p>If everyone watches calories</p>
        <p>Why are there none to see?</p>
