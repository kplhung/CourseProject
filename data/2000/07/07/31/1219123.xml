        <p>Every time Paul O'Neill tries to beat out an infield hit, he gradually slows after crossing the first-base bag, stops, bends at the knees and then shakes out his legs, as if he wants to make sure all his parts are still in working order.</p>
        <p>This is one of the very few signs that O'Neill is 37 years old. It is impossible to tell by his production: he had three hits and three runs batted in today, increasing his batting average to .307, as the Yankees beat Minnesota, 7-4, and completed a road trip in which they won five of seven games.</p>

        <p>Every time Paul O'Neill tries to beat out an infield hit, he gradually slows after crossing the first-base bag, stops, bends at the knees and then shakes out his legs, as if he wants to make sure all his parts are still in working order.</p>
        <p>This is one of the very few signs that O'Neill is 37 years old. It is impossible to tell by his production: he had three hits and three runs batted in today, increasing his batting average to .307, as the Yankees beat Minnesota, 7-4, and completed a road trip in which they won five of seven games.</p>
        <p>First baseman Tino Martinez drove in three runs today with a first-inning double, staking Andy Pettitte (11-6) to a 4-0 lead. Chuck Knoblauch, hampered by a sore elbow, returned to the lineup and collected two hits and two walks, scoring two runs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have won 18 of their last 26 games, aided by the additions of Denny Neagle, David Justice, Glenallen Hill and Jose Vizcaino. They will probably add more players before Monday's 4 p.m. trade deadline, if one of the various proposals the Yankees are discussing goes through.</p>
        <p>''Coming into this road trip, you got the feeling everything was starting to come together,'' O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>He has 120 hits and 72 R.B.I. after 100 games, a pace to finish the year with 194 hits -- that would represent a career high -- and 117 R.B.I., a total that would match his career high. He had 12 hits in 26 at-bats on the road trip and 12 R.B.I., driving in a run in the first, fourth and sixth innings today. ''He is so solid,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said. ''He is right now really having good plate coverage. He's really hitting the ball sharply; he's knocked in a lot of runs on this trip. I think he'll hit until he decides to quit.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill spoke vaguely of retirement last season, suggesting at one point that he might quit before the 2000 season. This spring, O'Neill said he would evaluate that option from year to year. His current contract expires at the end of this season. Perhaps, O'Neill said wistfully, he could play with the Cincinnati Reds in 2001, if the Yankees were not interested in keeping him.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees are expected to approach O'Neill about a contract extension in the next two months. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, would not address the question of the extension today, but he said: ''He's done a good job. He's been steady, like he always is. He's someone you can count on.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte said: ''He's just a phenomenal athlete. He's 37 years old, he's in great shape. He had a rough year last year, on his terms, and he was thinking, 'O.K., I'm getting close to the end of my career,' and all of a sudden he's having another career year. He's just a great player. He keeps himself in great shape and he could play several more years. He's got to be considered a huge part of this team.''</p>
        <p>Among the best baseball blooper highlights is a clip of O'Neill when he played for Cincinnati. He charged a base hit, dropped it, tried to pick it up again and dropped it, before his temper finally overcame him and a frustrated O'Neill punted the ball -- incredibly, right to the cutoff man.</p>
        <p>A gaffe he made today will not have the staying power of that mistake, but it did cause great hilarity in the Metrodome. In the sixth inning, O'Neill scrambled in to pick up a ground-ball hit, took the ball out of his glove and tried to throw -- but the ball squirted out of his hand, like a water balloon, flipping high into the air and falling about 20 feet or so in front of him. Both runners took an extra base on his first error of the season, and when O'Neill's blunder was replayed, laughter erupted from the stands.</p>
        <p>O'Neill turned and glanced seriously at the scoreboard; his acute self-deprecating humor kicked in after the game. ''It must be the way I throw the ball or something,'' O'Neill said. ''Definitely wasn't one of my finer moments. Definitely wasn't a web gem.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees have not announced when DAVID CONE will make his next start, but he is expected to pitch Saturday against the Seattle Mariners at Yankee Stadium. ORLANDO HERNANDEZ will throw in a minor league rehabilitation game Tuesday and could return to the rotation within 10 days if he does not have any setbacks -- which probably means that Cone needs to pitch well against Seattle to have a chance to keep his spot in the rotation. DWIGHT GOODEN, DENNY NEAGLE and ROGER CLEMENS will start in the three-game series against Kansas City, followed by ANDY PETTITTE on Friday. . . . CLAY BELLINGER started in place of the injured third baseman SCOTT BROSIUS and made two exceptional defensive plays, diving to stop a grounder and throwing to first and then bare-handing a bounder and throwing to first. Both balls were hit by second baseman JAY CANIZARO. Brosius is expected to return to the lineup Tuesday.</p>
