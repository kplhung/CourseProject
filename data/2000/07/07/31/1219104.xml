        <p>Colin L. Powell  Retired general</p>
        <p>Ever since the war in the Persian Gulf, Colin L. Powell has been the most eagerly courted yet most reluctant member of the Republican Party. Four years ago, he was mentioned as a presidential candidate, and even as recently as last week, rumors were flying about the possibility of him being the running mate of Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Powell, 63, was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993 and served under the man who was chosen as Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, the former secretary of defense.</p>

        <p>Conna Craig  Adoption advocate</p>
        <p>Conna Craig has worked with state and federal lawmakers to streamline adoption practices. The president of the Institute for Children, Ms. Craig has researched foster care and adoption practices around the world. Abandoned at birth, Ms. Craig was adopted at age 8 and raised in Northern California.</p>
        <p>Michael Feinberg  Teacher</p>
        <p>After starting an alternative education program with 50 fifth-grade students at a public school in Houston in 1994, Michael Feinberg has won acclaim for those efforts. The endeavor, Knowledge Is Power Program, was so successful, it expanded into two other middle schools -- a charter school in Houston that accepts students from all over Texas and a public school in the South Bronx. Students attend class much longer than most children, from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on weekdays and for several hours on Saturdays. Teachers are required to be on call at all times.</p>
        <p>Elaine L. Chao  President of United Way</p>
        <p>Elaine L. Chao, who was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and came to the United States at age 8, has taken part in several forums on race. Ms. Chao, who will speak about immigration, has emphasized the importance of looking at dialogues about race not as a debate between blacks and whites but as a discussion that should include a cross section of races. She was a deputy transportation secretary in the Bush administration and the head of the Federal Maritime Administration in the Reagan administration. She served as director of the Peace Corps from September 1991 to August 1992. In August 1992 she replaced William V. Aramony, who was convicted in 1995 of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, as president of the United Way of America. She resigned the position in May 1996. She is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the head of his party's campaign committee in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Sharon Darling  Literacy advocate</p>
        <p>Sharon Darling of Louisville, Ky., founded the National Center for Family Literacy in 1989 as a private, nonprofit corporation to teach 3- and 4-year-olds ''preliteracy skills'' like getting along with others and communicating orally. A former director of adult education for the Kentucky Department of Education, Ms. Darling will speak on community-based literacy programs. In 1988 she was honored for a program she helped start that focused on teaching scholastic and family skills to parents who had not graduated from high school. In 1989, Ms. Darling was chosen by Barbara Bush, then the first lady, to serve on the advisory committee to the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, a nonprofit group.</p>
