        <p>These days, as a staff of 85 toils to move treasures from a Chelsea warehouse to the New-York Historical Society, long-lost orphans keep turning up.</p>
        <p>For most of 196 years, budget constraints and volunteer staffs frustrated the society's record-keeping efforts. ''Through the generations,'' said Jan Ramirez, director of the society's museum, ''different people were in charge of different parts of the collection, making the oral history of the collection incomplete. We literally had to reconstruct the history of the society itself to find some of these things.''</p>
        <p>Worse, ''the collection moved eight times during 200 years,'' Ms. Ramirez said, ''so you can imagine what it was like for the society to haul its collections and records around.''</p>
        <p>But Leslie T. Davol, project manager of the society's new Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture, said the society ''has been getting intellectual and physical control over the materials in the collection.'' By the center's Nov. 17 opening, ''we'll have gone through everything in the museum,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Many treasures have already emerged. A two-and-a-half-foot-long brass time capsule, sealed by the Lower Wall Street Business Men's Association in 1914, ''was so forgotten that no one reopened it, and it has still not been reopened,'' said Margi Hofer, associate curator of decorative arts.</p>
        <p>Roberta J. M. Olson, a research and curatorial associate at the society, has done years of detective work on an ornate walnut red-upholstered French Empire chair, gilded and painted black, with decorative carvings. She said she had developed strong proof, which she will soon publish, that in the early 1800's the chair's regular occupant was Napoleon Bonaparte. Before it was donated to the society, the chair was brought to America in 1816 by his older brother, Joseph Bonaparte, who lived in New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth McCall, a collections specialist, found a 50-pound pine box ''back in a corner,'' she said, and discovered that ''it was filled with curious personal belongings.''</p>
        <p>Working from only a handwritten name on the box, she delved into reference works and consulted historians. Eventually she found that the box was the Civil War footlocker of Col. William Henry Paine (1828-1890), a prominent engineer in the Army of the Potomac who fought at Gettysburg. A largely self-taught engineering sachem, Colonel Paine had 14 patents to his name, and he made Bob Vila's career possible when he patented the retractable tape measure in 1858. (A working original was found in the footlocker.)</p>
