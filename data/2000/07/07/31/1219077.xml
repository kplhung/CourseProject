        <p>There are few areas of modern society that are as nasty, brutish and just plain catty as the world of fashion magazines. Fueled by skim cappuccinos infused with Sweet 'n Low and the rather desperate illusion that this month's hemline length is a matter of grave importance to the world's population, the fashion-editor's world is a place that embraces the casual morsel of malicious gossip and recycles it over and over again until it snowballs, in a frenzied crescendo of hushed cell-phone conversations and secret e-mail messages, into something resembling truth -- which, of course, it rarely is.</p>
        <p>Take a recent episode: Katherine Betts became editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar in August of last year. Less than a year later -- or faster than you can say ''Waiter, a saucer of milk for this table, please!'' -- a competing editor, Bonnie Fuller of Conde Nast's Glamour, buoyed by reports of Bazaar's sluggish newsstand sales, was angling for her job and had even created sample page spreads illustrating her vision for Harper's Bazaar, said one former Glamour editorial staff member who saw the spreads and one current staff member. A Conde Nast spokeswoman, Maurie Perl, disputed the story.</p>
        <p>The episode wound up in Inside.com and The New York Post. But what is more important is that the reports kicked off weeks of industry speculation about the safety of Ms. Betts's job -- which is, by the way, perfectly secure, said Hearst executives.</p>
        <p>''Things can become very personal very quickly,'' Ms. Betts said, discussing her  world in an interview in her 37th-floor office last week.</p>
        <p>But apart from dealing with the day-to-day slings and arrows of the magazine world, Ms. Betts faces several other challenges, some arguably greater than sidestepping the rumor mill. For starters, she had to take over from Liz Tilberis, a well-liked editor who died of ovarian cancer last year. Now, Ms. Betts must make a historic fashion magazine relevant and appealing to readers in a crowded field that includes W magazine, Vogue, Elle and Bazaar. All four fashion magazines must now also compete with fast-growing titles like Time Inc.'s In Style and Hearst's O: The Oprah Magazine, which have found readers by showing less concern with fashion than with celebrities (In Style) or self-improvement and lifestyle (O: The Oprah Magazine).</p>
        <p>Ms. Betts must also reconcile Bazaar's core philosophy, which has for much of its 134-year history been to document the evolution of high-end fashion and couture clothing, with changing American tastes at the retail level: Americans are less likely to spend money on formal clothing; they are buying casual wear at cheap-chic chain stores like H &amp; M and Banana Republic.</p>
        <p>Cathleen P. Black, chief executive of Hearst Magazines, said that part of the reason she hired Ms. Betts, who at 36 is the youngest editor in chief in Bazaar's history, was because she felt she could reconcile those issues.</p>
        <p>''The beautiful thing is that women can buy couture now, and they can also shop at Banana Republic,'' Ms. Black said. ''An editor does not have to make choices for all American women. Kate is a young, modern woman who can bring those concepts together in the magazine.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Betts must recast Bazaar after a year that has not been the smoothest sailing. During her first 11 months, she changed three-quarters of the magazine's editorial departments, and supervised a redesign that was criticized for streamlining the distinctive cover typeface conceived by the fabled art director Alexey Brodovitch. On a more personal level, Ms. Betts allowed the Lifetime network to film a documentary about her first few months on the job; while it showed several poignant moments of her balancing motherhood and work, the documentary, ''Putting Baby to Bed,'' also portrayed her at times as frosty and domineering.</p>
        <p>But as much as fashion-world habitues hope for more such morsels to chew over in lieu of lunch, they may be sorry to learn that from all outward appearances, Bazaar appears to be taking baby steps forward under Ms. Betts. Advertising pages are up 10 percent for the year, according to Cynthia R. Lewis, the publisher of Bazaar since April, as compared with last year, which was one of the worst in the magazine's history.</p>
        <p>''We are No. 4 in our competitive set, which is Elle, Vogue, W, and Bazaar, in terms of advertising,'' Ms. Lewis said, adding that she believed ''the window between us and W is closing.'' The September issue will have around 354 pages, Ms. Lewis said, the second largest September issue in the magazine's history. The February issue had 148 ad pages, and March 263, both the largest ever for those months.</p>
        <p>The rest of the picture is less clear: Overall circulation is steady; newsstand sales are up slightly; and subscriptions are down slightly.</p>
        <p>According to the Publisher's Statement filed with the Audit Bureau of  Circulations, the February 2000 issue, which was Ms. Betts's first, sold less than its 1999 predecessors on the newsstand. But March, April, May and June all sold more than the comparable issues the previous year. Subscriptions were down by 6.6 percent during the first six months of 2000, which Hearst executives say they expected with the redesign.</p>
        <p>Bazaar's refashioning comes at a time when all four of the fashion magazines appear to be in transition. W's publisher, Susan Blank, resigned unexpectedly two weeks ago; she was the third publisher in six months. W's ad pages in the all-important September issue will be less than last year's, said a Fairchild executive.</p>
        <p>Elle's editor in chief, Elaina Richardson, resigned two months ago to become director of Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. The new editor, Roberta Myers, has just taken over. Elle's ad pages are expected to be up moderately for the September issue.</p>
        <p>More important, Vogue -- Ms. Betts's former stamping ground -- is experiencing something of a setback. Ad pages will only be moderately up for the September issue, and publishing executives at Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, said Vogue's advertising pages may be flat for the year. Richard D. Beckman, Vogue's publisher, and Anna Wintour, its editor in chief, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>So, Ms. Betts's remaking of Bazaar comes at a time when she might be able to take advantage of setbacks at other magazines. Apart from a redesign that took hold in February -- it even retroactively changed the cover logo on Tilberis-era covers featured on subscription blow-in cards, to some criticism -- she has moved away from the stark photographic style that was a Tilberis hallmark in favor of less stylized, looser images. Ms. Betts also sought to give the magazine a younger feel by including features about largely undiscovered, even obscure fashion designers and artists, a decision she has since reconsidered.</p>
        <p>''Making the magazine feel younger was specifically part of our mandate,'' she said. ''I think the first three issues were definitely much younger-feeling, and that may have come as a shock to some readers. But our overall mandate, what I tell my staffers, is that we really want to be of the moment. There is so much competition out there and so much product that it is very hard to make every page of the magazine feel like it is right now, of this moment. And that, to me, is very important and something we will keep working for.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Black said, ''I think Kate would be the first to agree that the first few issues were too young, but she is evolving the magazine.''</p>
        <p>David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media services company, said Ms. Betts's Bazaar, most importantly, was appealing to advertisers.</p>
        <p>''I think the magazine is perceived to have some style and elegance, a little bit more whimsy, and is a little less chilly,'' he said. ''I think the initial reactions have been positive.''</p>
        <p>According to a Hearst executive, the feeling at the corporate level was one of minor disappointment during Ms. Betts's first months, but that has been recently tempered by the uptick in advertising pages. Unlike Conde  Nast, where editors and publishers come and go (and come back again),  Hearst is a company known for long-term relationships with its editors; Ms. Betts is one year through a three-year contract.</p>
        <p>Ms. Black said she would not comment about the length of any editor's contract, but she did say that Hearst remained fully supportive of Ms. Betts.</p>
        <p>''She is smart, she is a winner, and she is driven to make this magazine successful,'' Ms. Black said.</p>
        <p>Despite the occasional criticism and the heavy workload, Ms. Betts said she tries to remain buoyant, and follows advice given by her husband as the cameras were rolling for the Lifetime documentary: ''Take the  Eisenhower approach and radiate optimism at all costs.''</p>
        <p>''In this climate and in this day and age, everything is about the nanosecond, so people judge each other all the time,'' Ms. Betts said. ''When you're the leader of a team, it is very important to be coherent and have a point of view, and get everybody on the same page. If the message stops with one person, then you've lost it. That will not happen.''</p>
