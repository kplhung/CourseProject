        <p>TO hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case for opening up its instant messaging service -- or I.M., as it is known in the trenches -- is a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of autocratic rule.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Case, on behalf of the I.M. industry and users everywhere, tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of an America Online rival, Tribal Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve Case. ''Users of I.M., like users of e-mail and the telephone,'' Mr. Bagully said, ''deserve the right to free and open communication.''</p>

        <p>TO hear some rivals of America Online talk about it, the case for opening up its instant messaging service -- or I.M., as it is known in the trenches -- is a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of autocratic rule.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Case, on behalf of the I.M. industry and users everywhere, tear down this wall!'' Ross Bagully, chief executive of an America Online rival, Tribal Voice, said in testimony before the Federal Communications Commission last Thursday, after a speech by AOL's chairman, Steve Case. ''Users of I.M., like users of e-mail and the telephone,'' Mr. Bagully said, ''deserve the right to free and open communication.''</p>
        <p>Outside the F.C.C. building a handful of protesters marched with signs that read, ''Free I.M.!''</p>
        <p>The ''wall'' that Mr. Bagully referred to is the partition that keeps America Online's instant messaging service a closed system -- one that effectively prevents users of other companies' instant messaging services from exchanging messages with users of AOL's service. Instant messaging enables people to send messages over the Internet that pop up on a recipient's screen almost instantly, allowing people to communicate in ''real time.''</p>
        <p>In an unusual twist, the Microsoft Corporation is among a dozen or so smaller players in the I.M. market that decry what they consider to be AOL's market-dominating behavior in instant messaging, and they are demanding that it step up efforts to make its system interact with theirs. Among the other companies that share the 10 percent of the I.M. market not occupied by AOL are Yahoo, Odigo, iCast and Tribal Voice.</p>
        <p>It was the outcry by competitors that landed instant messaging on the agenda of the F.C.C.'s hearing, along with other issues -- most notably the question of equal access to Time-Warner's giant cable network -- as the commission reviews the pending merger of AOL and Time Warner. As far as instant messaging is concerned, competitors contend that AOL's closed network stifles innovation and stymies growth in their industry.</p>
        <p>With nearly 180 million registered users so far, I.M. is particularly popular with teenagers and families. But analysts predict that within a few years business people will account for nearly half of all I.M. users.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the debate is not about whether the various instant messaging systems will ever interoperate. Instead, the questions seem to be when and how. Even AOL does not dispute the need for an interconnection standard. But like most market leaders, the company would prefer to control the standard.</p>
        <p>So the debate comes down to which side you believe. AOL contends that the development and testing of an instant messaging standard will take over a year. Its critics accuse the company of stalling in order to better solidify its market position.</p>
        <p>At last week's F.C.C. hearing, Barry Schuler, president of AOL Interactive Services, said it would take a year for the industry to hammer out interoperability on a technical level, and even longer to complete the necessary testing for quality assurance. The company has continually insisted it needs time to ensure the privacy and security of its customers, particularly against spammers -- people or advertisers that blast unsolicited messages to hundreds or thousands of recipients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schuler compared the development of I.M. interoperability to the interconnection of e-mail networks, which the Internet industry did not achieve until about a dozen years ago. ''The problem was that no one envisioned spam -- it didn't exist yet,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''Had people understood what spam was they would have developed protocols in a different way. Unfortunately, the Pandora's box is opened now and can't be shut on e-mail interoperability.'' Mr. Schuler said AOL's competitors in instant messaging did not understand -- or have sufficient sympathy for -- the scope of the spam problem and how it might impact instant messaging. ''Nobody else has 23 million people paying them to provide an environment that's monitored,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the company said, it has already ''opened'' its network through royalty-free licensing agreements that allow Internet service providers and Web companies to use AOL Instant Messenger technology to create their own messaging software.</p>
        <p>But AOL's competitors see the spamming and security argument as a smoke screen. ''They've been saying that the last few months, but they've never backed it up with facts,'' said Avner Ronen, chairman of Odigo, which is based in New York.</p>
        <p>Last month, when AOL submitted its proposal for an I.M. specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force, the industry committee whose job it is to create a technical standard, competitors criticized its plan as unacceptably vague -- and a further sign of foot dragging.</p>
        <p>A year can seem an eternity on the Internet. So last week, a few days before the F.C.C. hearing, I.M. companies formed a new group to hasten the arrival of a standard, even if only a temporary one. The group, which calls itself IMUnified and is led by Microsoft, plans to release a temporary specification next month that would permit I.M. systems to talk to one another while a long-term solution is developed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Ronen said, ''We hope AOL will come to its senses and cooperate.''</p>
        <p>The I.M. dispute has been fraught with nastiness from the outset. Starting last year, Microsoft and other AOL rivals began using technical loopholes to interact with AOL's I.M. users. Each time, AOL technicians have quickly patched the holes. Odigo, a small I.M. provider with about a million users, says that on 17 recent occasions it found a way to connect its customers to AOL's, and that each time AOL blocked it.</p>
        <p>AOL considers these efforts ''attacks'' on its system and vows to defend itself against security breaches; its competitors contend their I.M. customers deserve to be able to freely exchange instant messages with users of other services.</p>
        <p>In the end, the AOL-Time Warner merger probably does not hinge on resolution of the instant messaging dispute. Certainly of greater concern to the F.C.C. commissioners last week seemed to be whether the merged company would make good on its promise to give all Internet content providers open access to its cable systems.</p>
        <p>But AOL's critics fear that open I.M. access will arrive even more slowly if it does not happen before the world's largest Internet service provider becomes part of the nation's largest Internet and media company.</p>
        <p>''We know from history,'' Mr. Bagully said, ''that those who unfairly exploit a market dominance don't get nicer as they get bigger.''</p>
