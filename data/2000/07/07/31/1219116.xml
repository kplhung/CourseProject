        <p>As he stood on the highest step of the victory podium after the German Grand Prix today, Rubens Barrichello had several good reasons to break out in tears and make gestures of thanks to a man in the heavens. But Barrichello also owed a little thanks to the sudden arrival of a man on the track.</p>
        <p>In a monumental race, the Brazilian Barrichello drove from 18th place on the starting grid to win his first race in 123 starts, a record number before a first victory. He also saved his Ferrari team its lead in the constructors' standing and prevented his teammate Michael Schumacher from a humiliating loss of his lead in the drivers' standing.</p>
        <p>''I still cannot believe it,'' Barrichello said. ''I had been told that when you are leading a race, the last lap is the longest, and it really felt like that. I had lost the taste because it was such a long time ago.</p>
        <p>''It was tricky because the rain was falling on different parts of the track at the time. And I was thinking it had to be mine.''</p>
        <p>Barrichello, who is in fourth place in the drivers' standing, has 46 points, 8 points behind Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard and 10 points behind Schumacher. Either McLaren driver would have overtaken Schumacher had they won.</p>
        <p>The man in the sky to whom Barrichello had gestured, he said, was Ayrton Senna, his mentor and fellow Brazilian, who died at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994.</p>
        <p>''I dedicate this race to him because he helped me so much in my life since 1984,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But it was through his own driving skills that Barrichello, 28, won today's race. He drove a cool, steady race and, after rain flooded half the track, made a bold decision to keep his dry-weather tires rather than to change to wet-weather tires.</p>
        <p>But when he started the race from 18th position, it did not look very good.</p>
        <p>Coulthard, from the pole position, swerved at the start to block Schumacher, who started from second place. Hakkinen, starting fourth, flew off in the opposite direction around Coulthard and Schumacher.</p>
        <p>Hakkinen took the lead while Schumacher swerved left, only to run into Giancarlo Fisichella, who started third, in a Benetton. Both cars spun off the end of the straightaway and into the tire barrier.</p>
        <p>Schumacher got out of his car and walked back to the pits, scowling; it was the fourth time in the last five races that he failed to finish, twice with technical breakdowns and twice in accidents. At the Austrian Grand Prix two weeks ago, he also went off in an accident on the first corner.</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed for what happened to me,'' Schumacher said, ''but I am very happy for Rubens, whom I have to thank for saving my first place in the drivers championship.''</p>
        <p>After blocking Schumacher, Hakkinen sped off, having gone from fourth to first before the first corner.</p>
        <p>''I was in heaven,'' Hakkinen said. ''My start was so fantastic. I was in front of David in the first 10 laps. It was a very comfortable situation.''</p>
        <p>Barrichello raced through the pack, gaining seventh place after only three laps. On Lap 12 he overtook Pedro de la Rosa for fourth place, and on Lap 15 he passed Jarno Trulli for third.</p>
        <p>With 30 laps left, Barrichello was only 14 seconds behind Hakkinen, the race leader, and 12.4 seconds behind the second-place Coulthard.</p>
        <p>Barrichello set the race's fastest lap and then stopped for fuel and a change of tires on Lap 18. But the McLaren cars were scheduled to make only a single pit stop, so he was not likely to pass them because he was scheduled for another stop.</p>
        <p>Then on Lap 25, as the storm clouds grew dark, a message from the race control tower came across the teams' computer screens, announcing: Man on track.</p>
        <p>A spectator had run to the edge of the track's long straightaway through the forest, threatening to go out on the track.</p>
        <p>''I was worried that the guy wanted to kill himself,'' said Barrichello, who like many other drivers had seen the man as they passed within a few feet of him.</p>
        <p>On Lap 26, the safety car neutralized the race to allow officials to remove the man. The man ran across the track between speeding cars before being apprehended.</p>
        <p>Race officials said the man was a former employee of Mercedes-Benz, McLaren's engine supplier, who was fired five years ago.</p>
        <p>The event turned the race into a free-for-all with many drivers making pit stops.</p>
        <p>Barrichello took advantage to make his second stop, while Coulthard, not sure when he was supposed to pull in, lost time behind the safety car as Hakkinen made a stop.</p>
        <p>The race restarted on Lap 29 with Hakkinen first, Trulli second and Barrichello third, with Coulthard having fallen back to sixth.</p>
        <p>An accident on Lap 30 involving Jean Alesi in a Prost and Pedro Diniz in a Sauber brought out the safety car again while the debris was cleared. Neither driver was hurt.</p>
        <p>When the race began again on Lap 32, the rain became a downpour on one sector of the track, and most drivers, including Hakkinen and Coulthard, decided to switch to rain tires.</p>
        <p>But not Barrichello.</p>
        <p>''I was told Hakkinen was coming in and I wanted to stay out one more lap,'' Barrichello said. ''I saw it was only wet in the stadium, and the team told me that if I kept doing the same lap times, I would win.</p>
        <p>''So I decided to stay out on the track.''</p>
        <p>It was that decision that allowed the Brazilian to win his first race in 123 starts -- the record had been held by Hakkinen, who won his first race in 1997 after 96 starts -- as both Hakkinen and Coulthard came out behind after their pit stops.</p>
        <p>Barrichello covered the 45 laps of the 4.240-mile track in 1 hour 25 minutes 34.418 seconds for an average speed of 133.806 miles an hour.</p>
