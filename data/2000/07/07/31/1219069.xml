        <p>Stepping up the race to stake out territory in the new world of digital books, Random House, the largest United States trade publisher, plans today to announce the creation of a new purely digital imprint.</p>
        <p>Beginning in January, the house will publish under the name AtRandom a list of about 20 purely digital books, by authors ranging from the editor of Harper's magazine to a downtown dominatrix. All will be sold online as electronic books or in single copies printed on demand, but they will not be shipped to bookstores.</p>
        <p>Random House becomes the second major house to begin a digital imprint, following Time Warner Trade Publishing, which this spring created a digital imprint of its own, iPublish.com.</p>
        <p>All the biggest New York publishing houses are now moving quickly to prepare for the possibility that digital books will soon take off. Over lunches at Michael's, the Four Seasons and other industry hubs, editors are quietly courting agents and authors, trying to sign deals for the digital rights to their new and previously published books.</p>
        <p>As they acquire new titles, they are beginning to establish the rules of digital publishing, from authors' royalties to the prices consumers will pay. In many cases, especially for brand name authors and older contracts, authors' agents have retained digital rights. For publishers, that means there is a vast pool of potentially profitable literary properties waiting to be claimed, sometimes from another house's list. Time Warner, for example, will publish the electronic versions of several books by the science writer, James Gleick, previously published in hardcover by Random House's Pantheon imprint.</p>
        <p>Both Random House and Time Warner are hoping to build their reputations as desirable places for authors to publish digitally, much the way places like Random House's sister imprint Vintage are prestigious names to appear under in paperback.</p>
        <p>Some in the book business wonder why the rush. Even Ann Godoff, president and publisher of Random House Trade Group and creator of the digital imprint, admitted that she had not yet managed to enjoy reading a book off a screen, or read a whole electronic book. Neither has almost anyone else in the industry. Many others, meanwhile, worry that online copyright protection is open to question.</p>
        <p>Print-on-demand books, though roughly comparable in appearance to trade paperbacks, remain expensive to produce. Lightning Source, which provides the service to publishers, charges a publisher $4.80 to produce a single copy of a 300-page book, which is more expensive than traditional printing except in handling titles that sell fewer than 1,000 copies a year.</p>
        <p>But many publishers have high expectations for the profits from the new digital books. Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner Trade Publishing, says selling electronic books will boost the industry's annual growth rate from single to double digits. The Microsoft Corporation will release a new version of its electronic book reader next week, the first version for reading on desktop and laptop computers as well as on expensive hand-held devices. Publishers say the company has estimated that 2 million people will download free copies in the first two weeks. Dick Brass, Microsoft's vice president of technology development, believes that the market for electronic books will exceed $1 billion in five years.</p>
        <p>''This is the brave new world we want to see,'' said Ms. Godoff at Random House. ''No printing, no paper and binding, no need for a sales conference or printed catalogue -- we don't know the size of the market, but it could be potentially very profitable for us.'' She has particularly high hopes for print-on-demand technology, because it enables publishers to profitably publish low-selling new and old titles with narrow readerships, and it obviates the risk of holding inventory.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Karp, vice president and senior editor at the Random House Trade Group, will head the new imprint. He said he began this spring approaching authors and agents about signing all-electronic contracts for new books, swearing each one to secrecy and revealing none of the other writers' names. Many have verbal agreements but no formal contracts yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karp said he acquired the rights to projects he thought suited the medium. ''The Quest to End Baldness'' by The New York Post columnist, Gersh Kuntzman, and ''Mistress Ruby Ties It Together'' by Robin Shamburg, a dominatrix who also writes a column for NYPress, may work better in electronic form because they can be bought and read in private without the embarrassment of taking them to a cashier. Others will be collections of previously published magazine articles by Harper's editor, Lewis Lapham, and the writers Tad Friend and Donald Katz. Such collections do not sell many copies in paper, but the low volumes make sense in electronic form, and new material might be added to the collections over time. Some will be as short as the equivalent of about 150 pages; others, like the collections, as long as 300-page books.</p>
        <p>At least one of Random House's new electronic titles is a full-length novel, ''Because She Is Beautiful,'' by Cameron Dougan, a first-time author. ''I couldn't be more flattered,'' he said. ''It doesn't matter if it is hardcover or paperback or downloaded if it's getting attention and people are recommending it to their friends.''</p>
        <p>Other titles include ''The Secret of Life,'' a book of advice from Elizabeth Wurtzel, author of ''Prozac Nation,'' and ''Walking On Ice,'' a biography of the hockey player Mark Messier by Meredith Berkman, a magazine writer.</p>
        <p>Random House will sell its digital books through online booksellers and other organizations' Web sites. The house plans to sell the books for about the price of a typical trade paperback, for a little less in electronic form and a little more in print-on-demand. It will pay authors royalties on electronic books of about 15 percent of the price -- about the same as a hardcover royalty rate. On print-on-demand titles, authors will receive 7.5 percent of the price, about the same as on a trade paperback.</p>
        <p>This fall, Random House also plans to publish digitally a hundred titles from its Modern Library imprint of classic titles. Some sets of several books, like the volumes of Marcel Proust's ''In Search of Lost Time'' or the complete works of Jane Austen, will be sold together as single bundles.</p>
        <p>Unlike Random House, Time Warner, which includes Little, Brown and Warner Books, will sell its electronic books from its own Web site as well as through online bookstores. Most of its new print books will also appear in electronic editions, as well as a handful of new digital books.</p>
        <p>''Our digital business will allow us to expand beyond the best-seller focus of the major chains,'' said Gregory Voynow, general manager of iPublish.com, explaining that in chains titles that sell in high-volumes are likely to get the most attention. ''This will allow us to have more control over our own destiny,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Internet, both publishers said, will allow the marketing books directly to likely readers on Web sites that reflect their interests, and letting them download an electronic book with a click.</p>
        <p>Time Warner also plans initially to discount its electronic books aggressively, charging about $7 or less for electronic versions of some books. Time Warner will also offer its authors a potentially higher royalty rate, about 25 percent of the publisher's net revenue, including income from any licensing or other deals.</p>
        <p>Publishers and agents involved agree that the ultimate digital royalty rates and book prices remain to be seen, along with the extent of demand for electronic books.</p>
        <p>''I said, sure, a 15 percent royalty rate, but it can't be precedent-setting,'' said Amanda Urban, agent for Tad Friend. ''The publicity attendant on this will compensate for the low advance, and collections of reprinted journalism are hard to get published today anyway.''</p>
        <p>But other agents are already putting up a fight.</p>
        <p>''These publishers are trying to divide up the new digital world before we have even mapped it out,'' said Robert Gottlieb, an agent at the William Morris Agency. ''It is like Antarctica. They have landed and they are saying it's theirs. There is a tremendous reduction in overhead from printing, distribution and all of that, and authors aren't enjoying the benefits of the increased profitability.''</p>
