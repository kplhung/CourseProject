        <p>Thanks to complex backroom maneuvering on the eve of a no-confidence vote in Parliament, it appeared today that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel would be able to keep his battered government afloat for the next three months.</p>
        <p>And meetings between senior Israeli and Palestinian officials today indicated that the effort to find peace is also still alive, despite the failed summit meeting at Camp David last week.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Barak, much of the speculation in the last few days centered on whether Foreign Minister David Levy, who has a history of changing sides, would resign over the Camp David peace talks and return to his roots in the rightist Likud Party. That could have set off a voting shift to the opposition in Parliament that would have forced new elections.</p>
        <p>But early tonight Mr. Levy announced, after meeting with Mr. Barak, that he would remain in the cabinet for now and abstain from the no-confidence vote on Monday.</p>
        <p>Instead of trying to topple Mr. Barak, Mr. Levy said, he would try to persuade him to create a broad-based government of national unity.</p>
        <p>''I am making all possible efforts to create a unity government, and if by Wednesday I do not succeed, I will resign from the cabinet and support the bill for early elections,'' Mr. Levy said on the Israeli radio.</p>
        <p>But the threat to resign on Wednesday has little practical weight because that is the last day  Parliament is to meet before adjourning for a three-month vacation that is so regular a part of Israeli political life that it is unlikely to be interrupted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy could vote Wednesday for a Likud bill that calls for Parliament's dissolution and new elections. But the bill is to be referred to a committee controlled by Mr. Barak's One Israel Party, which can bottle it up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy has criticized Mr. Barak for offering concessions to the Palestinians on Jerusalem and other issues without, Mr. Levy contends, being offered anything in return. Mr. Levy has also complained that he has been left out of the loop on this, the major foreign policy issue.</p>
        <p>During the Camp David summit meeting, which he declined to attend, staying home as acting prime minister, Mr. Levy made a sympathetic visit to a hunger strike by Jewish settlers protesting the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, apparently in an gesture to Mr. Levy after his announcement today, said, ''I have to make peace, or at least an interim agreement, with the opposition.''</p>
        <p>He said he needed to work with the opposition on the economy, education and social problems, issues that even his supporters have criticized him for neglecting in his concentration on peace efforts.</p>
        <p>But he quickly returned to his main focus, saying he would work with the opposition ''so that we may be able to try, not at any price, but, yes, with all our strength, to bring to the state of Israel security and peace and a different future for all our children.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Barak won a strong mandate in the general election. But electoral changes introduced in 1996 -- under which Israelis vote directly for prime minister as well as separately for Parliament -- have produced a fractured Parliament with a profusion of narrow-interest parties and the need for coalitions, which have proved unstable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak lost his parliamentary majority in the legislature on the eve of the Camp David talks, when three religious or rightist parties quit to protest the talks. That reduced his core support from 69 seats to 42 in the 120-seat body.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has not ruled out a national unity government, particularly if there is an outbreak of Palestinian violence. But bringing Likud or the religious parties into his coalition would probably halt peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Likud, for its part, said in a statement today that it had decided against joining a government of national unity and that it intended to topple Mr. Barak, whom it accused of lying to the people and breaking his promises to the public not to surrender any part of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''There is only one way now to stop the danger -- hold early elections,'' said the Likud leader, Ariel Sharon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon, a hawkish former general, said Israel needed a government that could reach ''a peace that was safer, a peace that was better, a peace that would last generations, a peace with a united, undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital.''</p>
        <p>And he said: ''Under no circumstances should we succumb to any temptation to form a national unity government because today we know exactly where things stand. There is only one option: to replace the government as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, senior negotiators from Camp David -- Saeb Erekat for the Palestinians and Oded Eran for the Israelis -- met in Jericho today to show symbolically that the peace effort was continuing. Their discussions were said to have included such unresolved issues as a long-declared plan to move Israeli troops and the release of prisoners.</p>
        <p>Ranking Israeli and Palestinian security officials also met in Gaza in the early evening, part of a joint effort to keep a lid on violence from extremists on each side.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Palestinian police in Gaza arrested the second-ranking leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi, in his home before dawn today. There was no immediate official explanation, but he and other Hamas officials have been vocal in their criticism of the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>During a demonstration in Gaza last week, Mr. Rantissi called on Mr. Arafat to abandon the peace talks and resume an armed struggle, or jihad.</p>
        <p>''Yes to the rifle!'' he exhorted the crowd. ''Yes to jihad!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, for his part, arrived in Saudi Arabia today for talks with Crown Prince Abdullah and others in the Saudi royal family apparently aimed at building support for some kind of Arab summit meeting to work out a joint position on issues in the peace talks, particularly the crucial question of the status of Jerusalem and its holy places. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt was in Libya today on a similar mission.</p>
