        <p>What am I bid for an image of a supersonic airliner, airborne, spitting the flames that signaled disaster? Last week, after a couple of auctions -- consisting of flurries of phone calls and e-mails on both sides of the Atlantic -- the take for the photograph snapped by a Japanese businessman was $50,000 and counting.</p>
        <p>The price, in part, reflected the economics of scarcity. On Tuesday afternoon, as firefighters and rescue vehicles streamed toward the village of Gonesse and the burning shards of the Concorde airliner, the photographers of agencies like Corbis-Sygma, Gamma/FHM and Sipa Press were jumping onto motorcycles and rushing to the scene, while agency executives were contacting photo editors around the world, making deals.</p>
        <p>But it was three amateurs -- a Hungarian aviation buff, the wife of a Spanish truckdriver and the Japanese businessman sitting on another plane at Charles de Gaulle airport in Roissy -- whose luck and reflexes produced the signature images that news audiences would carry in their minds' eye.</p>
        <p>Their work immediately created mini-markets, some as frenetic as they were ghoulish. There was little consistency in the economics. Disasters spawn whirlwind negotiations; the process is as idiosyncratic as a cyclone's path.</p>
        <p>Still, there are a few standing principles, the same ones that govern markets everywhere. The fewer the images, the more leverage the sellers have. The more the photo editors buying know about all the images available, the more leverage they have.</p>
        <p>Wire services tend to pay less than news magazines; tabloids tend to pay more. And in most cases, auctions and other negotiations are opened and closed within an hour. Editors and producers have only that much time to calculate how much to pay to deprive rivals of an image -- and then calculate whether it is worth swallowing the cost and possibly ponying up more should a better image come along before deadline.</p>
        <p>The route the Japanese businessman's photo took to become part of the media bloodstream does not provide a map to future profits by lucky amateurs. But it does illustrate the system in action.</p>
        <p>Buzz, a small new London-based photo agency, heard about the photo about a day after the crash. The businessman, whose name Buzz executives agreed to keep confidential, reached a member of the agency through intermediaries, and e-mailed the image to his home computer, said Steve Lake, a partner in Buzz.</p>
        <p>Hearing that the photograph was taken through a plane window with a disposable camera, Mr. Lake's Buzz colleague felt no urgency. But when he opened the e-mail after returning from work on Wednesday evening, he turned around. ''He stuck them on a disk, hopped on a scooter,'' Mr. Lake said. ''We popped them on a disk here and said, 'Yes, these are good'. ''</p>
        <p>It was 8 p.m. in London; newspapers were an hour, more or less, from their early deadlines. The crash was still big news, but it was a second-day story. The first day, the young Hungarian's grainy image of the plane in flight, which had been purchased and distributed by Reuters, had dominated front pages around the world. Was there a new still image, or was the Japanese snapshot the lone new image?</p>
        <p>''We made a few discreet inquiries,'' Mr. Lake said. ''There was nothing on the wire services. We thought, 'Well, that gives us a bit more leverage'. ''</p>
        <p>They started making calls to newspaper picture desks around Britain. ''We weren't sure how to price it,'' he added. Their opening suggestion was $:4,000 to $:5,000, or from $6,000 to around $7,500. By the time The Daily Mail, The Mirror, The Sun and The Express had finished bidding, the price was $:16,000, or close to $25,000, he said. The auction had taken an hour; when The Mirror closed the the deal, its presses were ready to start.</p>
        <p>The Mirror had purchased the rights to print the image in the United Kingdom. Thursday morning, the image dominated the tabloid's cover, under the headline ''NO CHANCE.''</p>
        <p>By that time, Mr. Lake was on the phone to Germany, selling the German print rights to the publication Bild. And several photo agencies, including Gamma and Sygma, were on the phone to Mr. Lake, suggesting that a tiny photo agency with one phone line might not be equipped to do the deals for international rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lake agreed. After an auction among photo agencies Thursday morning, London time, he agreed that Sygma would negotiate further deals; Buzz would get a percentage. By late morning, New York time, J. P. Pappis, Sygma's formidable New York-based negotiator, was on the phone to Sarah Harbutt, the photography director for Newsweek magazine.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harbutt, like her counterparts, Michele Stephenson at Time, Bronwen Latimer at U.S. News &amp; World Report, and Maura Foley at People, was looking for new images.</p>
        <p>The rush of photographers to the crash scene had already produced some wrenching photos. Some of these were spoken for: Time had a deal with Gamma/FHM giving it rights to the work of Eric Bouvet. Mr. Bouvet, who had been on a long-term assignment illustrating the work of French firefighters, got access to the crash scene through his fire contacts. But Mr. Bouvet's best pictures were also hardest to take: they showed charred corpses. ''It looks almost like Hiroshima,'' Ms. Stephenson said. ''Very strong. But it was too much to ask people to look at it.''</p>
        <p>Newsweek had struck its deal with Sygma. On Tuesday, Ms. Harbutt said, she had paid $5,000 to underwrite the cost of eight Sygma photographers at the scene, in return for first refusal on their images.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Pappis called Newsweek to offer first crack at the Japanese businessman's snapshot, an image new to the United States. For that, Ms. Harbutt said, Mr. Pappis proposed Newsweek pay $25,000. After ''lots of back and forth'' the two settled on a fee closer to $15,000 -- if you count the $5,000 Newsweek kicked in earlier, closer to $20,000. Mr. Pappis said he never discusses the terms of his deals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pappis, Ms. Harbutt said, ''makes you feel like the whole world wants this image and you are about to lose this image.'' But buying it is making a bet that there is no better image out there, at least none that will surface before the magazine goes to press Saturday. ''When I buy at the beginning of the week, I run the risk of being trumped,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Quality is another consideration. Ms. Harbutt said she considers whether an image is good enough to carry the cover, or whether it could be displayed across two inside pages.</p>
        <p>How much will the Japanese businessman earn? It depends on his deal with Buzz, and Buzz's deal with Sygma. ''He could have negotiated for himself,'' Ms. Harbutt said, ''but John Q. Public wouldn't know how.''</p>
        <p>When amateurs have some business acumen, she said, they can drive prices up. Ms. Stephenson said that one of the higher prices Time ever paid for an image went to a young business student who had, in a shoebox, the now-famous photograph  of Monica Lewinsky, in a beret, smiling up at President Clinton.</p>
        <p>How fast do photographs lose their value? ''It depends on the newsworthiness of the story,'' said Ms. Latimer of U.S. News. ''The amateur photographs taken in the Oklahoma bombing were iconic.'' As for the Concorde disaster, she said, the Hungarian student's image ''will remain in people's minds a long time.''</p>
        <p>Reuters will not disclose how much it paid for that first image of the Concorde in flight; printed accounts in Britain put the figure at under $1,000.</p>
        <p>If those figures are anywhere close to accurate, the image that thus far defined the Concorde crash, the image that had the widest audience, earned a small fraction of the fees that the Japanese businessman's image will attract.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Stephenson explained it, ''People want to know how much you can make from a photo like this. But there's no way to put a value on it, because the value depends so much on the timing, and on what else is out there.''</p>
