        <p>IN baseball today, the saddest of  possible words may well be: Darryl Strawberry.</p>
        <p>While hearts go out to David Cone, who, at 37, is wrestling sorrowfully with his baseball career, of not getting the fastball to hum, the slider to slide, among other woes, it is still primarily a baseball story, distressing for this wonderful competitor and achiever, but not tragic.</p>
        <p>Strawberry is a different story.</p>
        <p>For 20 years -- or ever since Strawberry was chosen by the Mets as the first player in the baseball draft in 1980, an 18-year-old left-handed batter out of Los Angeles brimming with such fabulous talent that it was immediately decided by the baseball cognoscenti that he would be the latter-20th-century Ted Williams -- we have followed him on the diamond, and in the news.</p>
        <p>We have followed him through thin and thick, through his mighty home runs and his mighty strikeouts, both on and off the field.</p>
        <p>We followed him as he made his way through battles with drugs, with alcohol, with the I.R.S., with a paternity suit -- and losing many of them. He was in rehab centers, under house arrest, released from the Dodgers and the Giants, suspended on a number of occasions, painfully trying to make it all right again, trying to come back time and time again. He became a born-again Christian with a look in his eyes at times that made him appear nearly hypnotized, and then lapsed. He sought to become a rededicated family man, a total team player, and to perhaps hang out with a better class of people than in previous times.</p>
        <p>When in 1995 George Steinbrenner gave ''this young man'' -- Strawberry was then 33 -- ''one last chance,'' he seemed to respond. ''I finally feel free,'' he said at the time. ''I just feel I can be me now, and not try to be someone other people wanted me to be. I don't feel the most important thing is to be a baseball star. The most important thing is for me to be a human being.''</p>
        <p>When Strawberry developed colon cancer in 1998, then beat it into remission and came back to help the Yankees win the World Series last October, he broke down at the ceremony honoring the team on the steps of City Hall and hugged the manager, Joe Torre, who was himself a cancer survivor and who had shown confidence in Strawberry. Regardless of one's feelings for Strawberry, it was hard not to be touched by this moment, by the apparent genuineness of the emotion, of this kind of triumphal culmination of the man's desperate struggles.</p>
        <p>And we followed him to this season when, in spring training with the Yankees, Strawberry, now 38, failed a drug test -- and was quickly suspended by the baseball commissioner for a year for violating the baseball drug laws again. A year earlier he had propositioned an undercover detective in Tampa, Fla., and had in his wallet a small amount of cocaine -- along with photographs of his wife and young children.</p>
        <p>And we followed Strawberry to earlier this month when he was seen attending a sex club in Florida, which, in addition to being questionable judgment on his part, may have also been off-limits behavior because of his parole stemming from the sentencing on the cocaine charge last year. We discovered, too, that he had decided to leave early from the drug rehabilitation center he had been in for the last two months. And then, grievously, it was learned that his colon cancer may have returned.</p>
        <p>He said he had been in the club only once, and momentarily, while a photograph of him with an, at best, underdressed young woman was seen nationwide. He said he left the rehab center to try to play baseball again to earn a living for his family, amid rumors that, after earning in the neighborhood of $30 million in baseball, he was broke. Maybe all of it is true, maybe none of it is, because he has not always been honest when caught or confronted.</p>
        <p>The sadness with Strawberry is, of course, twofold. One is the diminishment of what might have been one of the great careers in baseball, from one kind of sickness that he might have had control over. The other, to be sure, is the tragedy of the physical cancer that he may well have had no control over.</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine, the manager who was a coach with the Mets in Strawberry's first three years with the team, from 1983 to 1985, watched the 6-foot-6-inch Strawberry arrive in the major leagues with a talent for the ages and then show signs of squandering that talent. ''We've all been in places we shouldn't, and maybe done things we shouldn't,'' Valentine said yesterday. ''But many of us say: 'Whew, that was close! I'm not going to do that again.' But Darryl had a supernatural talent, and it may have made him believe he was invincible. He was bigger than anyone else, he was faster than anyone else, he was stronger than anyone else, and so many people were telling him how great he was. Early on, he was skating on thin ice but thought he was walking on water.''</p>
        <p>Keith Hernandez, a teammate of Strawberry's for most of Strawberry's career with the Mets, which ended in 1990, was himself addicted to cocaine and, in a trial in 1985 spoke about the grip that this ''devil on earth'' had on him. ''I was able to finally go cold turkey to beat it,'' Hernandez said yesterday while at Shea Stadium for a Mets reunion. ''Some can beat it, some can't. An addiction is a terrible, terrible thing. I remember at one point hating it, but feeling unable to control it. I feel sorry for Straw. Basically, I believe he's a good guy. And I'm sure all of his so-called conversions have been genuine, but then something else is working on you.</p>
        <p>''But the thing about his not becoming the next Ted Williams, or not living up to his potential, well, he's not the Lone Ranger. It's happened to others -- it happened to me to a degree. And that's hardly the important thing at this point for Strawberry. Now he has to deal with the colon cancer again. Who cares now whether he could have hit 500 home runs in his career, or broken Babe Ruth's records?</p>
        <p>''Right now, all one can do -- should do -- is hope he gets healthy again.''</p>
