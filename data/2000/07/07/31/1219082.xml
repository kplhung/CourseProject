        <p>Dealing yet another blow to Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori's wobbly government, the head of the agency charged with overhauling Japan's faltering financial system resigned today in the face of a fast-growing scandal over his relationship with one of Japan's largest financial institutions.</p>
        <p>Kimitaka Kuze, the chairman of the government's Financial Reconstruction Agency, submitted his resignation this afternoon as Mr. Mori cut short a trip to Ishikawa prefecture to return to Tokyo to deal with one more crisis in his short administration.</p>
        <p>''I decided to resign because I thought my personal problems might disrupt parliamentary deliberations,'' Mr. Kuze said at a news conference. ''This is a time when the government is facing important domestic and foreign relations issues, and I wanted to ensure there were no misunderstandings about the financial administration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuze acknowledged on Friday that he received 230 million yen, or $2.1 million at current exchange rates, in cash and benefits from the Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corporation for advisory work he did over 13 years that ended in 1996. He refused to resign then, contending that he did nothing illegal under the laws at the time, a contention he continued to maintain tonight.</p>
        <p>However, his critics in the opposition party, which is gaining strength at the expense of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, insisted that the payments were a bribe from the industry Mr. Kuze was charged with overseeing. And Mitsubishi Trust issued a statement saying it had indeed hired him for his political connections, among other things.</p>
        <p>Reports on Saturday that Mr. Kuze had accepted 100 million yen, or $920,000, from a condominium developer only further fueled doubts about his ability to serve as the head of the agency. More and more companies are seeking debt waivers, a trend that may mean that the government ends up holding the fate of several debt-laden real estate and construction companies in its hands.</p>
        <p>He was the second head of the agency to resign under a cloud this year, and his departure is likely to raise further doubts about the government's ability and commitment to restructuring the financial system, which two years ago was poised to collapse. Michio Ochi was forced to step down in February after he made remarks suggesting that he would water down bank inspections.</p>
        <p>So the agency, which was established in the fall of 1998, has had three different chairmen in less than a year, and has found itself unable to withstand outside pressure. It has been forced into two embarrassing retreats, first on the issue of whether to use public money to bail out a department store owner and, most recently, over the terms of the agreement it made to sell the bankrupt Nippon Credit Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori replaced Mr. Kuze with Hideyuki Aizawa, a member of Parliament who chairs the finance committee of its lower house and has been a harsh critic of the commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mori has demonstrated an almost uncanny knack for political blunders since taking over as prime minister after Keizo Obuchi was incapacitated by a stroke and later died in May. The prime minister, a veteran Liberal Democratic politician who was battered by surprising losses for the party in parliamentary elections in June, had recently been bolstered by presiding over a trouble-free summit meeting of the leaders of the world's industrialized countries.</p>
        <p>He has stuck his foot in his mouth so many times since he became prime minister in April that, during the news conference that closed the summit meeting, he shuffled through cards printed with answers to anticipated questions before saying anything.</p>
        <p>He is widely blamed within his own party for the heavy losses it suffered during the June elections -- criticism that increased when the drubbing was followed by another bribery scandal involving the former construction minister, Eiichi Nakao.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Mori's knowledge of Mr. Kuze's relationship with Mitsubishi Trust will come under scrutiny. He and other leaders of the Liberal Democrats were tipped to the relationship by an anonymous letter threatening to expose the matter to the media should Mr. Kuze win a cabinet post.</p>
        <p>The party insists that it conducted a thorough investigation and determined that Mr. Kuze had not violated any laws.</p>
        <p>The main opposition party, which itself has been on the defensive during the last few weeks for its role in drafting the laws that govern the sputtering resurrection of Japan's financial system, had seized on the appointment of Mr. Kuze to renew demands for Mr. Mori to step down. Mr. Mori ''knew the situation when he made the appointment and thought it was O.K.,'' Yukio Hatoyama, the head of the opposition Democratic Party, said in an interview with N.H.K. television. ''So of course he has responsibility for the appointment and responsibility to explain it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Aizawa, a financial bureaucrat who was a prisoner of war in Russia after World War II, has objected to the agency's proposal to allow non-banks to operate in the banking sector, so his appointment would likely delay the plans of companies like the Sony Corporation and Ito-Yokado to set up banks. He also supports a move in Parliament to curtail the use of government guarantees to aid the financial industry.</p>
