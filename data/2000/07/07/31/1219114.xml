        <p>Equatorial Guinea is a poor Central African nation that is hoping to become a rich Central African nation. In 1996, American companies began to pump major oil deposits from the waters around Equatorial Guinea and production has been rising steadily. If the new oil revenue is managed well, it can educate, heal and provide jobs for the country's half-million people.</p>
        <p>But oil brings risks as well as opportunities. Rarely have developing countries used oil money to improve the lives of the majority of citizens or bring steady economic growth. More often, oil revenues have caused crippling economic distortions and been spent on showy projects, weapons and Paris shopping trips for government officials. The people of misgoverned Equatorial Guinea may see few benefits from their nation's oil.</p>
        <p>Petroleum helps a nation most when its government already has democratic accountability, fiscal discipline and a bureaucracy that is based on merit and is relatively free of corruption. Norway, which first struck oil in the North Sea in 1969 and started getting substantial income from it 10 years later, has managed its resources wisely. Norway used oil money as a catalyst to broaden the country's manufacturing base. It required oil investors to put money into other industries as well. Thanks to oil, Norway now sends three times as many people to college as it did in the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>Most oil producers, however, do not have Norway's advantages. In many cases, such as Nigeria, oil revenue has simply disappeared into the overseas bank accounts of dictators and their cronies. Oil is particularly corrupting because it is hard to keep track of and easy to turn into cash. It is tempting to spend the sudden windfall on pharaonic works or arms. OPEC countries spend more of their G.N.P. on weapons than do other developing countries.</p>
        <p>Oil-producing countries also score lower in health and education than many poorer nations. Kuwait has twice the per capita income of Barbados, for example, but people in Barbados live better. The biggest problem is that even though petroleum provides few jobs, fluctuates wildly in price and will some day run out, the sudden profits can lead to a reliance on oil and a withering of the rest of the economy. Norway was cautious because it studied the experience of the Netherlands, which suffered in the 1960's when natural gas revenues were allowed to hide problems in other industries.</p>
        <p>In Venezuela, oil allowed the central government to hire huge numbers of unneeded workers, finance inefficient state enterprises and obtain large loans. Oil exports also led the government to set exchange-rate policies that made the rest of its exports uncompetitive, which then reinforced its dependence on oil. In the last decade, when other Latin American countries were carrying out needed economic reforms, Venezuela's oil cushion sapped the political will for needed austerity programs. Many Venezuelans believe that oil has also undercut the importance of personal initiative by offering wealth without work.</p>
        <p>The leaders of Equatorial Guinea say they are determined not to make the mistakes of oil-rich but still-impoverished Cameroon, Gabon and Nigeria. But even leaders aware of the pitfalls of oil will not be able to avoid them if corruption and mismanagement are endemic.</p>
