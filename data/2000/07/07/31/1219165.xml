        <p>Rallying to President Hugo Chavez's call for radical social and political change, Venezuelans on Sunday granted the former paratrooper a new six-year term with enhanced powers, top officials said.</p>
        <p>''This is a day of revolution,'' Mr. Chavez, 46, who in 1992 led an unsuccessful military coup attempt, said after casting his ballot this morning at a suburban polling station. ''Today a new republic is being born.''</p>
        <p>The ease with which Mr. Chavez will be able to carry out his revolution, however, depends on the outcome of races to elect 165 members of Congress and 23 state governors.</p>
        <p>Results of those races were still being tallied early today. Supporters of the president are expected to win a majority of the posts, but polls indicate that Mr. Chavez may fall short of the two-thirds majority he needs in the National Assembly in order to govern without constraints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez has promised to use his time in power to sweep away the last remnants of the traditional political order in this nation of 23 million people that in recent years has been the United States' top oil-supplier.</p>
        <p>Hours after the polls were supposed to close, there were no official results. However, both the head of the outgoing legislature and the interior minister, Luis Davila, said on national television that preliminary official results showed that Mr. Chavez had won handily.</p>
        <p>Voter surveys posted by the the newspaper El Nacional gave Mr. Chavez as much as a 20-point margin over his main challenger, Francisco Arias Cardenas.</p>
        <p>In the last 18 months, Venezuela's poor, disillusioned by decades of corrupt and unresponsive government, have united around Mr. Chavez and his plan for a complete overhaul of society.</p>
        <p>The preliminary results, announced late Sunday night, were quickly followed by fireworks and other celebrations across the capital. Thousands of jubilant Chavez supporters wearing the red beret that is the emblem of their movement marched with flags and banners on the Miraflores presidential palace downtown, demanding that Mr. Chavez appear on ''the people's balcony'' to address them.</p>
        <p>When he finally emerged, wearing the same red beret and a military-style uniform, Mr. Chavez called for national ''unity, persistence and patience.'' But he once again resorted to the language of conflict and confrontation that has become his trademark, boasting that ''we have routed the forces of the adversary'' and warning that ''one battle has ended and another is beginning.''</p>
        <p>The vote on Sunday was the culmination of a contentious process of sweeping political change that began with Mr. Chavez's landslide victory in a December 1998 presidential vote. As a candidate, he promised voters a ''peaceful social revolution'' if elected, but also said he would need a new constitution with expanded powers in order to carry out the transformation the country needed.</p>
        <p>In three elections last year, a constitutional assembly was first convoked and next selected and then finally it submitted a new charter to voters for approval last December.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Chavez's term of office was expanded from five to six years, and a ban on sitting presidents seeking immediate re-election for one more term was removed -- creating the possibility that Mr. Chavez could remain in office until 2013.</p>
        <p>Even before the changes were approved, though, the Congress, dominated by discredited opposition parties, and the Supreme Court were eliminated and replaced by weakened entities that have proven subservient to Mr. Chavez and his leftist Patriotic Pole coalition.</p>
        <p>The authority of governors and mayors was also reduced, the role of the armed forces was vastly expanded and a Chavez loyalist was placed in charge of the powerful state oil company after it was purged.</p>
        <p>With the new Constitution in hand, Mr. Chavez called a vote to elect a new unicameral congress, as well as governors, mayors and state and municipal legislators, a total of more than 6,200 elected posts. In what he described as an attempt to ''relegitimize'' his rule, he also submitted the presidency to a new vote, anticipating no real challenge.</p>
        <p>But in February, Mr. Cardenas, a former army colonel who was Mr. Chavez's second-in-command during the 1992 coup and spent two years in jail with him afterward, broke ranks and announced his own candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez, he charged, was assuming dictatorial powers, tolerating the corruption he had pledged to eradicate, alienating the United States and forging an undesirable alliance with President Fidel Castro of Cuba.</p>
        <p>In an unusual last-minute incursion into the campaign, Mr. Castro invited a group of Venezuelan journalists to Cuba on Saturday and issued a ringing endorsement of Mr. Chavez, wishing him ''good luck and lots of votes'' during a rambling news conference that was televised live here. ''Hugo, I am sure that nothing or no one can hold you back,'' the Cuban leader said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro's remarks, which appeared to violate a ban on politicking here after the formal close of the campaign, came days after a man turned up claiming to be a Cuban intelligence agent and said that Mr. Castro has sent 1,500 operatives here to infiltrate the Venezuelan government. As the news conference was taking place, Mr. Chavez called Mr. Castro, and the two men discussed baseball before ridiculing the accusations of a Cuban spy network operating here.</p>
        <p>Since taking office 18 months ago, Mr. Chavez has consistently praised Mr. Castro and the Cuban revolution while attacking his domestic critics as ''a rancid oligarchy'' and pursuing a nationalist and populist political line. The resulting polarization of Venezuelan society, with the poor overwhelmingly lining up behind Mr. Chavez and the middle class reluctantly supporting Mr. Arias, was once again on display during the balloting on Sunday.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Chavez's strongholds here is a working-class neighborhood called 23 de Enero, the site of a popular uprising in which hundreds of people died in 1989, after the government raised gasoline prices. The area voted heavily for Mr. Chavez in 1998, and appeared today to have rallied to his side again, with scarcely a supporter of Mr. Arias to be found during interviews with voters.</p>
        <p>''Venezuela has awakened, and we will never let ourselves be fooled again,'' said Julia de Tirado, 61, who described Mr. Chavez on Sunday as the antidote to 40 years of corruption and misgovernment under a pair of traditional parties. She praised him for being ''honest and hard-working'' and said that ''if he were not our president, things would be disastrous.''</p>
        <p>But across town, at a polling place at a private high school in the middle-class neighborhood of Chacao, a woman conducting an exit poll for a local firm said Mr. Arias appeared to have a two-to-one advantage over Mr. Chavez. Among the the most vociferous of those voting against the president was Irma Galindo de Baez, 50, who was wearing a button that proclaimed ''throw the crazy man out.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Baez said she voted for Mr. Chavez in 1998 because ''Venezuela needed a change -- it couldn't go on with the dictatorship of the political parties.'' But ''this government has been a disaster,'' she said. ''This guy has really scared us'' with his incendiary language, ''there has been a lot of corruption,'' and the police have allowed a farm owned by her family to be seized by peasants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez himself voted early, thanked Venezuelans for choosing ''a new horizon, a new path,'' and then spent several hours playing baseball. Later, though, he met with his economic team to draw up what he described as ''measures of great impact for the first 100 days of the new government,'' and on Sunday night  he said he will address the nation on Aug. 2 to announce the details of ''a new economic model for Venezuela.''</p>
