        <p>After losing a court battle over replacement parts for damaged cars last October, State Farm Insurance stopped requiring body shops to use lower-priced generic car parts. And the companies that supply these parts went into a tailspin.</p>
        <p>Several other big auto insurers, facing their own lawsuits, followed State Farm's lead, and sales in the $1.5 billion generic car parts business plunged by 30 percent. Some small suppliers even went out of business.</p>
        <p>Now, the generic parts industry is fighting back.</p>
        <p>In a suit filed on Thursday in state superior court in Fresno, Calif., a local company that distributes generic parts statewide and that is backed by the industry's trade group, the Auto Body Parts Association, is asking that the Illinois decision against State Farm be declared invalid in California.</p>
        <p>Ronald S. Katz, the lawyer who filed the suit on behalf of the Fresno company, Collision Parts Network, argues that California law specifically permits insurers to use generic replacement parts and that an Illinois court lacks the authority to countermand California law. He also raises several procedural questions which he says undermine the class action suit in Illinois, in which State Farm was ordered to pay a $1.2 billion judgement.</p>
        <p>If the California court accepts its argument, the Auto Body Parts Association says it plans to try to undo the Illinois ruling in other states.</p>
        <p>But Patricia Littleton, one of the lawyers in the original State Farm case, said she thought there was little chance the challenge would succeed.</p>
        <p>There is no dispute over whether generic parts can be used, she said; in most states, they can. But in California and most other states, she said, the generic parts must be of ''like kind and quality'' to those that are being replaced. The main issue with State Farm, she said, was that the company had promised in its policy contracts to meet this standard.</p>
        <p>The court and jury decided that the generic parts, sometimes referred to as aftermarket or OEM -- for original equipment manufacturer -- parts, were inferior to original factory parts and that State Farm had breached its contract.</p>
        <p>''The court in Illinois is not telling the other states what to do,'' Ms. Littleton said. ''It just said that State Farm lied and that that was wrong.''</p>
        <p>So the California challenge, sets the stage for a rerun of the Illinois case and its debate over quality.</p>
        <p>''We're saying these parts can be as good and that they are as good and that they often come off the same assembly line as OEM parts,'' Mr. Katz said.</p>
        <p>That has been State Farm's contention all along. State Farm says it uses generic parts because they are indistinguishable from others, and their lower cost has enabled State Farm to keep premiums from soaring. A number of consumer advocates, including Ralph Nader, have sided with State Farm, saying that without generic parts, the auto manufacturers would have a monopoly on replacement parts.</p>
        <p>The price difference is substantial. Ford charges $192 for a fender for a 1995 Explorer; the generic fender costs $79. State Farm and other insurers say that to assemble a 1997 Ford Taurus from factory spare parts would cost $72,000. The cost of the car new was $19,000.</p>
        <p>To restrain costs, New York, Massachusetts and Hawaii encourage or require the use of generic parts. But the lawyers suing State Farm say that, until now, the states have simply assumed high quality. In fact, the lawyers say, generic parts often do not fit right and can reduce the appearance, functioning and resale value of a car.</p>
        <p>Ms. Littleton and her colleagues in the State Farm case have filed additional suits on similar grounds against eight other insurers: Allstate, Safeco, USAA, Liberty Mutual, Geico, Farmers, Progessive and Country Companies, which has a significant share of the auto insurance market in Illinois. The lawyers have also filed a second suit against State Farm to cover customers whose cars were repaired with generic parts since early 1998 -- the cutoff date for customers to be included in the original suit.</p>
        <p>State Farm filed papers on an appeal of last October's ruling in May, said Dave Hurst, a spokesman. The response from the opponents is due next Friday. The two sides are expected to face off in Illinois' Fifth District Court of Appeals in Mount Vernon, near St. Louis, in the fall.</p>
        <p>Until the State Farm decision, said Scot Hansen, the owner of the generic parts company in whose name the new suit is being brought, ''business was going gangbusters.''</p>
        <p>''Then,'' he said, ''we began to see a downturn. We had a lot of calls from body shops asking us to pick up these parts and give back their money. Some of the insured wanted parts already installed on their vehicles replaced. Basically, the market evaporated.''</p>
