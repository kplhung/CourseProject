        <p>During the age of the sailing ship, Spain built a global empire stretching from Havana to Potosi in the Andes to Manila -- the first empire on which the sun never set. But it paid dearly for its achievement. Thousands of Spanish ships went down over the centuries, many heavy with gold and silver, emeralds and diamonds, porcelains and fine steels.</p>
        <p>In modern times, Spain has taken little action as treasure hunters and marine archaeologists have raised its sunken riches. It watched as Mel Fisher found the Nuestra Senora de Atocha, a galleon that sank off the Florida Keys in 1622. He eventually hauled up about $400 million in treasure, and gave Queen Sofia of Spain one of its cannons.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time, Spain is laying claim to its lost ships, and it has won a legal battle over the issue.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, a federal appeals court in Virginia ruled that Spain owned the remains of two warships lost off the Virginia coast two centuries ago. The ruling snatched the ships away from Ben Benson, a treasure hunter who had estimated that the shipwrecks bore more than a half-billion dollars in lost coins and precious metals.</p>
        <p>The shift in Spain's stance, experts said, could mark an end to the glory days of treasure hunting and the beginning of a time when Spain oversees the recovery of its lost fleets in pursuit not only of doubloons but of cultural riches, historical insights and new respect for Spanish graves.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Benson, president of Sea Hunt, a salvage company named after an old television show, may fight the ruling. Having spent nearly $2 million on preliminary recovery work and legal fees, he is sailing to the Bahamas, he said in an interview last week, to meditate on whether to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked,'' Mr. Benson said of the ruling. ''There's no case law to support their conclusion. It's uncharted waters for the shipwreck industry as a whole.''</p>
        <p>James A. Goold of Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, who led Spain's legal fight, said the victory was sound and long in developing. ''I'm sure a lot of treasure hunters view this decision with alarm,'' he said, ''but they should have known it was coming.''</p>
        <p>Spain said the victory marked the start of an aggressive effort on its part to look after its old interests and, probably, to team up for recovery work with coastal nations whose waters hold its sunken ships.</p>
        <p>''It's a turning point,'' said Rafael Rodriguez Ponga, director of cultural affairs in the Foreign Ministry in Madrid. ''It's a very important step in the recognition of the rights of Spain all over the world.''</p>
        <p>He added that it was hoped that Spain's recovery of vanished ships and artifacts, and their display in public museums and analysis by scholars, would illuminate and deepen appreciation of Spain's past.</p>
        <p>David Beltran, legal adviser to the Spanish Embassy in Washington, said the victory in Virginia would have major repercussions. ''We need to fix the rules about shipwrecks all around the world,'' he said. ''This ruling sets a strong precedent.''</p>
        <p>Over the ages, Spain lost whole armadas of tall ships to gales, mishaps and piracy because it started its conquests so early and acquired so many distant lands, especially in the Americas and the Philippines. Near the peak of its influence, from 1580 to 1640, it also ruled Portugal and that country's colonial possessions in Africa and Asia.</p>
        <p>The recent battle over the lost ships -- La Galga (Spanish for the greyhound), which went down in 1750, and Juno, which sank in 1802 -- was joined not only by Spain but also by Britain and the United States, which sided with Spain.</p>
        <p>Legal experts said those nations, and others with long maritime traditions, are increasingly eager to assert ownership of their old shipwrecks now that technology is fast opening the seas to exploration and recovery.</p>
        <p>In backing Spain, the Justice Department argued that the United States owned thousands of lost vessels and sought to ensure that they were ''treated as sovereign ships and honored graves and are not subject to exploration, or exploitation.''</p>
        <p>The appellate court, in its ruling, noted the government's stance favorably. The courts, it added, ''cannot just turn over'' sovereign wrecks to commercial salvors when all the nations involved agree that ''title to the shipwreck remains with the original owner.''</p>
        <p>Legal scholars said the strong opinion was likely to affect shipwreck claims in many territorial seas and by nations other than Spain. It may, they added, strengthen state claims to high-seas wrecks. Previously, the traditional rule was ''finders keepers,'' as when French and American salvors laid claim to the Titanic, the sunken British luxury liner.</p>
        <p>Based in Norfolk, Va., the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit covers Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina. Its opinion weighs heavily in shipwreck law because hundreds of lost hulks lie in coastal waters off those states. The area off Cape Hatteras, N.C., is known as the graveyard of the Atlantic, so numerous are its shipwrecks.</p>
        <p>Spanish officials estimate that Spain lost 600 ships in American waters alone.</p>
        <p>In the Sea Hunt case, which involved dozens of lawyers, the State of Virginia sided with Sea Hunt, citing a 1987 federal law giving states jurisdiction over abandoned ships in coastal waters. Significantly, Mr. Benson had agreed to give Virginia some of the recovered loot and 25 percent of any profits from treasure that he sold.</p>
        <p>Barry L. Clifford of Provincetown, Mass., who found a famous pirate ship off Cape Cod and helped Mr. Benson hunt for Spanish wrecks, deplored the appellate court's ruling and Spain's ownership claims.</p>
        <p>''Every ounce of that silver and gold was stolen,'' he said, referring to theft from the indigenous peoples of Central and South America. He added that the people were ''forced into slavery'' to mine the precious metals.</p>
        <p>If Spain recovers its lost booty, Mr. Clifford added, it will raise questions of whether it should pay compensation, just as Germany has agreed to make financial amends to victims of the Nazis.</p>
        <p>Spain, playing down the treasure issue, portrayed the two lost ships in the case as military grave sites and avoided any hint that it was interested in lost gold, contending that Juno and La Galga at the time of their sinking carried no riches of any significance.</p>
        <p>The case began in 1996, when Mr. Benson won Virginia permits to explore coastal waters off Assateague Island. He soon said he had found the remains of Juno, a 34-gun frigate whose sinking took more than 400 lives, and of La Galga, a 50-gun frigate, most of whose crew and passengers are said to have reached land safely.</p>
        <p>But in 1998, Spain sued for ownership and possession, contending that it had never abandoned the ships, the issue at the heart of the case under common law. In 1999, a federal district judge, J. Calvitt Clarke Jr., awarded La Galga to Virginia and Juno to Spain. He cited distinctions in international treaties of 1763 and 1819 as legal rationales.</p>
        <p>But writing for the appellate court, Chief Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson 3rd argued that both ships belonged to Spain because any abandonment of sovereign shipwrecks had to be explicit, not implied.</p>
        <p>David J. Bederman, an Emory University law professor who helped represent Sea Hunt, said the court's opinion would be influential but disputatious. ''We're going to get into historical arguments over what is sovereign and private,'' he said in an interview, adding that ''the meaning of that has changed over 500 years,'' with private ships more common in modern times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez Ponga of the Foreign Ministry disagreed and said ownership in those days was usually unambiguous, with the crown often in charge. Spain, he said, had very good shipping records, and ownership issues would be settled case by case.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter for us if there is treasure or money,'' he added. ''It's a question of sovereignty.''</p>
