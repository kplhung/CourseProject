        <p>In the chronicles of New York City firefighting, the things that happened at 315 Livonia Avenue in Brooklyn yesterday will hardly warrant a footnote. No one was killed or seriously injured, the flames were confined to one apartment on the 13th floor and five members of a family were rescued by firefighters.</p>
        <p>But for those five family members -- and for two firefighters who ran into their blazing apartment, crawled down a smoke-filled hallway and shared their air packs with the trapped woman, her brother and her three children until help arrived -- it was a day of survival and heroism, a poignant day to remember.</p>
        <p>''I have a 6-year-old son myself,'' Lt. Dennis Gordon, 42, said after the rescue, in which he and Firefighter Michael Cummings, 44, joined the family behind a wall of flames and shared their lifesaving air, as well as the peril, for eight minutes as deadly smoke encroached.</p>
        <p>The drama began about 8:15 a.m., fire officials said, when Kim Williams, 32, awoke to discover flames engulfing the living room of her three-bedroom apartment, 13-E, at the S. J. Tilden Houses on Livonia Avenue at Mother Gaston Boulevard in the Brownsville section.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams, shrieking in terror, roused her sleeping brother Eric Mitchell, 36, and her children -- Marcus Russell, 5, Donnell Russell, 4, and Taquenan Russell, 3. They were forced to retreat down a hallway to a back bedroom, where they huddled for 15 minutes on the border of hope and dread.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't get out,'' said Ms. Williams, who shut the door against the nightmare and huddled on the floor with her children and brother. The room soon began to fill with  smoke. They opened a window, but that only seemed to draw more smoke from under the door.</p>
        <p>There had been no time to call the Fire Department. But a next-door neighbor, Barbara Evans, 65, heard noises, saw smoke in the hall and called in the alarm. She and two sons, Kevin and Derrick Davenport, also threw wet rags to the family from a hallway window.</p>
        <p>Under the command of Chief Robert Brown, firefighters of Ladder Company 120 and Engine Company 231, six blocks away at 107 Watkins Street, arrived within minutes. The plan was to hook up a hose to the nearest standpipe, on the 12th floor, tapping into a tank on the roof of the 16-story building and a hookup from the standpipe's base to a hydrant on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>But the standpipe valve on the 12th floor, apparently unused for years, was sealed up with paint, and the firefighters lost precious minutes struggling to open it.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Gordon and Firefighters Cummings and Brian Gallagher, 35, all of Ladder Company 120, entered the apartment and found the living room and kitchen area almost completely engulfed. Furniture and cabinets were burning, flames were shooting out shattered windows and blinding smoke filled the rooms.</p>
        <p>The firefighters each carried about 130 pounds of gear, including air packs that each held about 17 minutes of compressed air, and face masks that enabled them to breathe in rooms where the gases from smoke can quickly be deadly.</p>
        <p>Firefighter Gallagher also carried a portable fire extinguisher. While he attacked flames to cut a momentary path, Lieutenant Gordon and Firefighter Cummings plunged across the kitchen and into a 25-foot hallway, which in two zigzag turns led to the three bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Smoke already filled the hallway, and they fell to the floor, where it was least dense, and crawled forward to search for victims. They could see almost nothing.</p>
        <p>They searched two bedrooms and found no one. Minutes later, they reached the back bedroom, where the family members were trapped. The firefighters could hear them gasping, coughing and trying to scream, but could not see them until they were virtually face to face.</p>
        <p>''They were all huddled on a mattress under the window,'' Lieutenant Gordon recalled. ''The smoke was burning their eyes and throats. The kids were going limp from lack of air. The littlest one looked like she was going to pass out. She was not responding.''</p>
        <p>By that time, Firefighter Gallagher's portable extinguisher had run out, the flames had begun to fill the hallway, and the firefighters, too, were trapped. ''There was nowhere we could go,'' Lieutenant Gordon said. ''We had to stay there until help came with water.''</p>
        <p>As they waited, the two firefighters immediately took off their air masks to share with the family members. Each was given 20 to 30 seconds of air before the mask was moved onto another face. Lieutenant Gordon said up to eight minutes elapsed before help came.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty confident,'' he said. ''We were in radio contact. The others knew we were there. It was just a matter of time until they got through with water.''</p>
        <p>The two youngest children, Donnell and Taquenan, fell unconscious.</p>
        <p>Finally, firefighters cleared the standpipe and brought heavy water to bear on the flames. Firefighter Gallagher was the first to follow his comrades down the hallway, crawling under the smoke. He carried Taquenan out to safety, while Firefighter Cummings carried Donnell out. Lieutenant Gordon then led the two adults and Marcus safely out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell was taken to Kings County Hospital Center and treated for smoke inhalation. Ms. Williams and her three children were treated at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, also for smoke inhalation, and the children were admitted overnight for observation.</p>
        <p>The Red Cross sheltered the family, and relatives, neighbors and friends said they would help, too. Ms. Williams is unemployed but enrolled at Medgar Evers Community College. The family's apartment was a charred shambles: the furniture, the clothing, photographs, the children's drawings and collages, all destroyed.</p>
        <p>''We lost practically everything,'' a downcast and exhausted Ms. Williams said at the hospital last night. It had all happened so fast -- the fire, the rescue, the rush to the hospital -- that there had been no time to thank the firefighters.</p>
        <p>But Lieutenant Gordon, 22 years in the department, and Firefighters Cummings and Gallagher, both sons of New York City firefighters, had not waited around to be thanked.</p>
