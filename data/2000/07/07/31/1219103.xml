        <p>For Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, the contrast to four years ago could not have been more stark.</p>
        <p>At 8:55 tonight, the New Jersey governor took center stage at the ''Welcome America'' festivities here and spoke for 68 seconds. And alongside Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, she threw a switch lighting the Ben Franklin Bridge.</p>
        <p>With that, before the Republican National Convention had even begun, Mrs. Whitman's official duties for the week were done.</p>
        <p>In 1996 Mrs. Whitman was on Bob Dole's short list of potential running mates. This year, as Mrs. Whitman has had to acknowledge in one interview after another, she wasn't even asked to submit personal background material to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>In 1996 she was thought of as an eventual presidential candidate in her own right. Now, if Mr. Bush wins, Mrs. Whitman's prospects are widely seen as limited to a cabinet post, at best, or maybe an ambassadorship -- the political equivalent of being put out to pasture.</p>
        <p>At the Republican National Convention in San Diego four years ago, Mrs. Whitman, who shared leadership duties with Governor Bush, was on stage every night. She delivered a prime-time speech, and she was mobbed by autograph seekers wherever she went. Now, the only people following Mrs. Whitman around are her state police bodyguards.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's stature has been on the decline since 1997, when she vetoed a ban on the late-term abortion procedure that its opponents call partial-birth abortion, though it had been passed by both Republican-controlled houses of the State Legislature. That an appellate court just last week overturned the ban, passed after the Legislature overrode her veto, would prove small consolation.</p>
        <p>''That sealed her political future,'' said John Tomicki, a lobbyist for right-wing causes in Trenton.</p>
        <p>In November 1997, Mrs. Whitman, despite her national celebrity, failed to win a majority of the votes in her re-election bid and barely squeaked past her Democratic challenger, James E. McGreevey, the little-known mayor of Woodbridge.</p>
        <p>More recently, the governor's national image has been marred by the controversy over racial profiling by state troopers. And her political potency within New Jersey was called into question once again when she abruptly canceled a run for the Senate last fall, saying the burden of raising money was too great.</p>
        <p>By this year, even Mrs. Whitman's most ardent supporters held little hope that she would be given a spot on the national ticket.</p>
        <p>''She'd become the bete noire of the pro-life movement,'' said former Representative Dick Zimmer, a Republican running to recapture the 12th District seat from Representative Rush Holt. ''So that even if Governor Bush were inclined to choose a pro-choice running mate, it probably wouldn't have been her.''</p>
        <p>Admirers of Mrs. Whitman here lamented the storm of criticism she endured this month after a snapshot surfaced showing her grinning as she frisked a black man, apparently at the urging of a state trooper, while on a ride-along in Camden in 1996. ''It's one of the most unfair things in politics I've ever seen,'' Mr. Zimmer said.</p>
        <p>At least there were no ''I'm frisky for Christie'' buttons for sale among the hundreds with Mr. Bush's smiling face. But the image seemed to hover like a too-obvious punch line upon any mention of Camden.</p>
        <p>Some eyes rolled, for example, when the governor told New Jersey delegates on Saturday that tonight's festivities on the Camden waterfront -- the only part of the city that has been rebuilt -- would ''show off the kind of good things that happen when Republicans get involved in cities.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Whitman, 53, is doing her best to sound content with her role at this convention, and to appear relevant. She tried hard in several early interviews to pump up the Republican ticket, minimize the importance of its platform and change the subject from her party's opposition to abortion rights.</p>
        <p>During the convention, the governor noted, she will be appearing on more than 20 television programs. And she says she takes solace from her continued cachet as a talking head.</p>
        <p>''After having been the co-chair, to then speak on Monday afternoon at 3:30 holds no great attraction,'' Mrs. Whitman said. ''If you're not speaking in prime time, it's better to do the kinds of things I'm doing. And the fact that they've asked me to do so much of that is, to me, an indication that there's still something that goes along with my name.''</p>
