        <p>John Mead likes his dances to tell stories. Not all of the tales told on Saturday night at the Frederick Loewe Theater were clear. But even at their nuttiest and most obscure one was willing to follow Mr. Mead into the small, complete worlds the stories created.</p>
        <p>Had the woman in Mr. Mead's ''Piano,'' a solo set to Mahler, given up her career as a musician to have a baby? Was the woman in ''Preparation'' a refugee from an asylum?

        <p>John Mead likes his dances to tell stories. Not all of the tales told on Saturday night at the Frederick Loewe Theater were clear. But even at their nuttiest and most obscure one was willing to follow Mr. Mead into the small, complete worlds the stories created.</p>
        <p>Had the woman in Mr. Mead's ''Piano,'' a solo set to Mahler, given up her career as a musician to have a baby? Was the woman in ''Preparation'' a refugee from an asylum? Who were the four women in gaudy confectionary party dresses who gamboled though Mr. Mead's ''Mise-en-scenes,'' sharing the stage with a present-giving man in swim trunks, to French songs and what sounded like movie music?</p>
        <p>What made the dances consistently interesting, puzzling though they sometimes were, was Mr. Mead's firm, relaxed sense of craft and his choice of dancers, all of them acute, subtle movers and expressive performers. Yoon Jeong Jin's long, reaching arms communicated both lyricism and an aching sadness in ''Piano.'' Tania Lavin held one's interest in a potentially tiresome role in ''Preparation'' with performing that never lost its feel of inward truth. Jason Smith was nicely menacing as the blank-faced man who rose from the audience to carry her to and from the stage.</p>
        <p>Daffiness ruled persuasively in the performing of Sunhwa Chung, Ms. Jin, Hsaio-Lei Lee and Collette Stewart in ''Mise-en-scenes,'' with Jean Sebastien Sialelli providing wry ballast. The intensity and nuance of Lily Cabatu Weiss's performing gave new life to a familiar role in ''Vows,'' the one nonpremiere on the program, which explored a doomed relationship with fluctuating shifts of power and submission between a woman and a man, danced with chill stoicism by Mr. Mead.</p>
        <p>The program was completed by ''Cumulus,'' which was filled with delicate intertwinings crisply executed by Ms. Jin, Stacey Royce and Ms. Steward. Dressed in white and off-white soft tops and pants, they looked as much like angels as like the shifting cloud formations suggested by the dance's title. The evening's sensitive lighting was created by Chris Brown.</p>
