        <p>It started out as part of a grim and little noticed routine in the city: an apparently homeless man, found dead on a Manhattan street, was transported to the city medical examiner's office for an autopsy.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, as the body of the man, found in front of a Third Avenue storefront, was rolled on a gurney through the morgue at First Avenue and 30th Street shortly after 10 a.m., a newly installed sensor detected something unusual and potentially dangerous -- radiation.</p>
        <p>That prompted officials at the medical examiner's office to phone for help, and soon firefighters from the hazardous-materials unit and officials from the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management were on their way to the scene, unsure quite what to expect. The code for a hazardous-materials incident crackled over the airwaves. Protective gear and masks were at the ready.</p>
        <p>Geiger counters found no traces of radiation in the ambulance that had carried the body from Third Avenue and 25th Street or on the paramedics and others who had come into contact with it, city officials said. Radiation was not detected anywhere else but inside the man, allowing officials to breathe easier.</p>
        <p>The man -- whose identity was still unknown yesterday afternoon -- had probably had a diagnostic test not long before he died that relied on some kind of radioactive material, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The residue from such tests could have set off the sensors.</p>
        <p>''The readings that we received were extremely low,'' said Fire Battalion Chief Carl Jost. ''They posed no exposure problem to anyone. It's an internal reading. It's something within the body.''</p>
        <p>The new radiation sensor was installed as part of a renovation of the medical examiner's office that took months and that has brought new DNA laboratories and offices and added high-tech gear. Ms. Borakove said officials realized the need for the radioactivity sensor after a waste hauler contracted to dispose of biohazardous material discovered radioactivity in waste that was being removed from the offices last year.</p>
        <p>While the morgue itself was declared safe from radioactivity yesterday, officials knew little more about the man. His age remained a mystery, as did the cause of death. Ms. Borakove said the autopsy would be performed today or tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Without knowing the man's identity, no one could say yesterday how a man who appeared to have been homeless might have received such a sophisticated test.</p>
