        <p>The conflict between India and Pakistan over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir is one of the most volatile and intractable in the world, but the past week has brought the first tentative signs since intense fighting last summer that tensions may be lessening, if only for a while.</p>
        <p>Hizbul Mujahedeen, one of the largest anti-India militant groups operating in the part of Kashmir controlled by India, announced a unilateral three-month cease-fire on Monday that is intended, one of the group's leaders said, to give ''peace a chance.'' Hizbul has been fighting for years so that Jammu and Kashmir, India's only majority Muslim state, would have the right to join the Islamic nation of Pakistan.</p>
        <p>India, which insists that Kashmir is an integral part of India, responded to the Hizbul offer on Friday by inviting its leaders and those of all other militant groups in Kashmir for talks. And the Indian Army announced Saturday that it was suspending military operations against Hizbul Mujahedeen, though not against other militant groups.</p>
        <p>But the fragility of this peace initiative became apparent today. Hizbul was already threatening to undo it unless India agreed to make the talks ''unconditional.''</p>
        <p>When it invited Hizbul to negotiate, India left out its usual requirement that such talks take place within the context of the Indian Constitution, which defines Kashmir as an inalienable part of India. But Brajesh Mishra, India's national security adviser, suggested in a television interview on Saturday that the Constitution would define the conversation.</p>
        <p>''Surely any representative of the government of India cannot be acting outside the Constitution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mishra's statement outraged Hizbul, which issued a statement in Islamabad today saying: ''India is once again using its traditional deception and duplicity. Unless New Delhi announces in unequivocal and categorical terms that talks will be unconditional and not under the Indian Constitution, the Hizbul will not honor the cease-fire promise.''</p>
        <p>It is far from clear what is behind the Hizbul Mujahedeen's initiative, which was denounced by other militant groups, as well as by the head of Pakistan's main religious political party, the Jamaat-e-Islami. Was the cease-fire conceived by Hizbul, or a result of behind-the-scenes negotiations with Pakistan, India or both?</p>
        <p>Is there any possible middle ground between India and the militants, who have long held diametrically opposed views on Kashmir? At this point, there is no evidence that either Hizbul or India has a solution in mind that would be acceptable to both parties.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, other efforts to find a peaceful solution to the insurgency in Kashmir, which has killed 25,000 people, have come to naught. And India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since 1947 over Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Lt. Gen. John Ray Mukherjee, who announced the army's cessation of operations against Hizbul, said a majority of the estimated 1,500 militants in the overwhelmingly Muslim valley of Kashmir are with Hizbul. He said most of them are from Kashmir, not Pakistan or Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>India's home minister, L. K. Advani, said on Saturday that the level of violence in Kashmir has come down since Hizbul's cease-fire announcement. ''We have no hesitation in talking to our own people though they may have strayed to the path of militancy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There is a broad range of speculation about who convinced Hizbul Mujahedeen to declare the cease-fire -- all of which assumes that Hizbul did not make the decision on its own and much of it that Hizbul is financially supported by Pakistan. India Today, a news magazine, reported this week that Indian intelligence sources said they had swayed leaders of Hizbul, who were looking to establish supremacy over other militant groups.</p>
        <p>But some military analysts in Pakistan and India say they find it difficult to believe that Hizbul would have taken such a dramatic step without the tacit approval of its supporters in the Pakistani government.</p>
        <p>They say Hizbul's initiative could be part of a Pakistani effort to regain the international standing it lost last summer, when forces backed by Pakistan sneaked into the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and occupied treacherous mountain peaks, setting off weeks of heavy fighting.</p>
        <p>Once India discovered the infiltration, it abruptly ended promising peace talks with Pakistan and began a military and diplomatic assault that led to the withdrawal of Pakistan-backed forces from the Kashmir heights. In the West and in India, Pakistan was seen as the aggressor.</p>
        <p>''Could it be that Islamabad was not in the loop?'' Ejaz Haider, a military writer for The Friday Times, a weekly based in Lahore, Pakistan, asked in a column about the Hizbul cease-fire offer. ''This does not sound plausible.''</p>
        <p>But the Pakistan Foreign Office denied, as always, that Pakistan had any clout with militant groups.</p>
        <p>When asked about Hizbul's cease-fire offer, he said: ''That is a matter for Kashmiri leadership to decide as part of the dynamics of their struggle. We do not wish to comment on that further.''</p>
        <p>Since last summer, India has repeatedly refused Pakistan's offers to restart talks, saying it will not negotiate again with Pakistan until there is a marked decline in the Pakistan-sponsored militancy in Kashmir.</p>
        <p>Despite the recent decline in violence in Kashmir, India's offer this week to talk with militant groups, notably, did not include Pakistan.</p>
