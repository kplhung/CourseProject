        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Moral Sense in Estate Tax Repeal,'' by Alan Wolfe (Op-Ed, July 24):</p>
        <p>It is surely true, as Mr. Wolfe suggests, that most American parents, like most parents everywhere, have a deep desire to help their children flourish. It is also true that Congressional Republicans have been trying to exploit that desire as a way of generating support for repeal of the estate tax.</p>
        <p>Yet repeal would primarily benefit those who are already in an unusually good position to assist their children, even with the tax in place. And it would do nothing for those Americans who have not taken part in the recent prosperity, and who have no wealth to leave their children.</p>
        <p>That is why many people -- including many parents -- oppose repeal of the estate tax. And it is why we should be wary of concluding, as Mr. Wolfe does, that repeal of the tax truly ''corresponds to the basic moral instincts of most Americans.''</p>
