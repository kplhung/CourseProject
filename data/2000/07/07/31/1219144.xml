        <p>Re ''The Moral Sense in Estate Tax Repeal'' (Op-Ed, July 24):</p>
        <p>The seemingly counterintuitive commitment of minority groups to repeal of the estate tax is understandable. Theirs is the first generation to enjoy the possibility of providing financial security for their children. The estate tax thus seems to them  only a mechanism to snatch this away.

        <p>Re ''The Moral Sense in Estate Tax Repeal'' (Op-Ed, July 24):</p>
        <p>The seemingly counterintuitive commitment of minority groups to repeal of the estate tax is understandable. Theirs is the first generation to enjoy the possibility of providing financial security for their children. The estate tax thus seems to them  only a mechanism to snatch this away. But repealing the tax poses serious risks to providing opportunities for those currently needing them.</p>
        <p>One solution would be to raise the exemption to levels that would encompass the wealth of the majority of the newly affluent (for example, $3 million to $5 million). Another solution would be to exempt from estate tax only that component resulting from newly earned money derived from salary or investments.</p>
        <p>The estates of succeeding generations would have a similar exemption for newly generated money, but would have to pay the full estate tax on the component of inherited money remaining within their estates.</p>
