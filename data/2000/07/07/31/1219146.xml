        <p>Re ''New York to Seek Private Managers for Worst Schools'' (front page, July 27):</p>
        <p>For a very long time our public schools have been starved of money, constructive attention and respect. Now that conditions have sent alarming numbers of educators out of the city to the suburbs and other states, the schools have arrived at a crucial period.</p>
        <p>And the reaction from the schools chancellor and the Board of Education is once again to focus on form: summer school programs, after-school programs, more tests, a longer school day, a longer school year, tenure, privatization.</p>
        <p>This narrow focus encourages the notion that we've tried everything  and nothing has worked. The fact is, unless we move our attention to the issues of teaching and learning, we haven't tried anything.</p>
