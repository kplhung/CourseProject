        <p>Good earnings reports for some of the biggest names in American commercial insurance last week suggested that long-depressed prices for coverage were beginning to rise. And that caught the attention of investors.</p>
        <p>Share prices rose sharply for the American International Group, the biggest and strongest of the group, as well as for the Chubb Corporation; the St. Paul Companies; Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, the world's largest insurance brokerage; and theHartford Financial Services Group.</p>
        <p>''Prospects are clearly improving,'' said Weston Hicks, an analyst at J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>Marsh McLennan &amp; Companies, the world's largest insurance broker, reported a 17 percent rise in operating earnings, to $506 million, for the second quarter. American International Group, widely known as A.I.G., posted an increase of 13 percent, to $1.43 billion. Hartford Financial Services also reported an increase of 13 percent, to $239 million.</p>
        <p>The Chubb Group reported a 10.5 percent rise in operating income, to $180.7 million, but its per-share earnings remained flat at $1, reflecting an issue of stock for the recent purchase of Executive Risk, a company specializing in liability coverage for company executives and board members. But, as did the St. Paul Companies, which reported a 9 percent decline in operating income, to $158.9 million, Chubb reported improvements in profits in its commercial lines. At the Hartford Group, earnings from life insurance offset heavy property-casualty claims. But the company reported a 7 percent increase in worldwide property casualty premiums, to $1.8 billion.</p>
        <p>''The market is so excited because it is seeing things happening that are going to lead to better results in the future,'' Mr. Hicks said.</p>
        <p>The stocks had extra spring in them, he said, because, in terms of revenue and net assets, they have been trading at extremely cheap prices.</p>
        <p>Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of A.I.G., which operates in more than 130 countries, said that in his company's domestic business ''there is an increasingly better tone to the commercial property-casualty market as rates continue to firm.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Frank, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, noted that several of the property-casualty companies had negotiated higher prices with customers. Mr. Frank upgraded his rating on the St. Paul Companies from neutral to buy and increased his price targets for St. Paul as well as A.I.G. and Chubb.</p>
        <p>''We're seeing the commercial insurance market improving virtually across the board,'' Mr. Frank said.</p>
