        <p>The Yankees are weighing a possible trade with San Diego for pitcher Matt Clement and outfielder Eric Owens, as well as separate deal for Colorado's Pedro Astacio, after the Baltimore Orioles scuttled a proposed three-team, 11-player blockbuster trade that would have altered the Yankees' lineup, rotation and bullpen.</p>
        <p>The trade deadline is 4 p.m. Monday, and the Yankees have a handful of trade options from which to choose after a crazy week filled with dozens of proposals. Those options apparently no longer include a deal for Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff, however.</p>
        <p>This proposal is on the table: The Yankees could trade Alfonso Soriano, a star infield prospect playing in Class AAA, along with Jason Grimsley, a major league pitcher, and Brandon Knight, a minor league pitcher, to the Padres for Clement, a hard-throwing right-hander, and Owens, who would fill the void in left field created by Shane Spencer's season-ending knee injury.</p>
        <p>Clement, 25, has been regarded as one of baseball's best up-and-coming pitchers, but he has struggled lately; he allowed nine earned runs in three and one-third innings against Pittsburgh on Friday with a Yankees scout in attendance. He is 9-10 with a 5.62 earned run average and has allowed 129 hits and 81 walks in 129 2/3 innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would be acquiring Clement for his potential, and what the Yankees would do with him in the immediate future was unclear. They could insert Clement into their rotation and bump the struggling David Cone, or they could try to use Clement as a middle reliever now and count on him for the rotation next year. Adding Clement would also give the Yankees the depth to trade Ramiro Mendoza, who is becoming more expensive to keep each year.</p>
        <p>Owens, 29, was a journeyman minor leaguer who emerged in the last couple of years, and is renowned for his grit. Owens is hitting .304 with 4 homers and 32 runs batted in, and has 20 stolen bases in 32 attempts. He is considered a solid left fielder; it is his ability to play left regularly that makes him attractive to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''What getting a left fielder would mean to us is freeing up David Justice to D.H. a little bit more,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''Otherwise, he'd play the outfield a little more than you'd want him to, and that would be O.K., too. That's what I mean, it's not an emergency where you have to do something.''</p>
        <p>If the Yankees traded for Astacio, 30, then he might replace Cone immediately. He is 9-10 with a 5.16 E.R.A., but those numbers are skewed by the conditions of Colorado's Coors Field. Astacio, who throws very hard, is 3-5 with a 4.19 E.R.A. in road games, with 70 strikeouts in 73 innings. He has allowed 29 homers over all, but only 11 on the road.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will have to outbid both the Toronto Blue Jays and the Chicago White Sox for Astacio, who has two years remaining on his contract for a total of about $15 million.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays may be offering a package that includes one of their top young pitchers -- perhaps Chris Carpenter or Roy Halladay -- and Chicago is dangling Jon Garland, another good young pitcher, as well as others. Soriano is presumably in the package being offered by the Yankees, along with the Class AAA pitcher Adrian Hernandez, a Cuban defector.</p>
        <p>The Yankees believe they can make a trade for outfielder Chad Curtis, the former Yankee now with Texas, if their other proposals fall through.</p>
        <p>Curtis, who was traded to the Rangers in the off-season, speculated that he might have been dealt because of his strong religious beliefs and because of his clash with shortstop Derek Jeter last season. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said those were not factors in his decision, and today Torre indicated that if Curtis returned, personal conflict and past comments would be put aside for the good of the team.</p>
        <p>''I don't pay attention to what people say,'' Torre said. ''Jimmy Leyritz left here and he came back. If you feel someone is a fit for your team, more so on the field than you worry about anything else. We're concerned about winning, and the whole makeup of our team is that way. If someone fits professionally on the team, that's what we concern ourselves with.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees considered proposals that included everyone from Tino Martinez to Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and Montreal's Rondell White in the past week, and they turned down the chance to trade Randy Keisler, a minor league pitcher, to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Matt Stairs today.</p>
        <p>But the huge three-team deal they wanted to make came together quickly today, to the verge of completion, before falling apart. The Padres would have served as the conduit. They would have swapped catcher Carlos Hernandez, Owens and a minor league outfielder, Jeremy Owens, to Baltimore in return for Surhoff and catcher Greg Myers.</p>
        <p>The Padres would have shipped Surhoff, Clement and reliever Donne Wall to the Yankees for Soriano, Adrian Hernandez, Grimsley and Marcus Thames, a minor league outfielder. The Yankees would have had a new left fielder in Surhoff, a starting pitcher in Clement and a middle reliever in Wall.</p>
        <p>The Orioles rebuffed numerous offers from the Yankees for Surhoff and constantly demanded Soriano in return. Baltimore executives were not initially aware of how San Diego intended to shuttle Surhoff to the Yankees or that Soriano would be included in the trade, going to the Padres.</p>
        <p>When the Orioles learned this, they backed out. Yankees officials have long suspected that the Orioles were leery of dealing with them because they are division rivals -- and in fact, that was indirectly the reason for the collapse of the trade. According to an executive with knowledge of the discussions, the Orioles felt that if the Yankees wanted Surhoff so badly and were willing to part with Soriano, then they should be willing to do so directly. ''We're not going to help Steinbrenner,'' said one official, referring to the Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, ''unless he helps us.'' (St. Louis subsequently acquired Carlos Hernandez in a trade that will be announced Monday.)</p>
        <p>No matter what the Yankees do -- or do not do -- they have raised expectations with the additions of Denny Neagle, Justice, outfielder Glenallen Hill and infielder Jose Vizcaino. This is a team built and honed, at great expense to the farm system, to win a third consecutive World Series; if the Yankees accomplish this, they will be the first team to do so since the 1972-74 Athletics. Anything less will be considered a disappointment, considering all the trades they have made, and may make Monday.</p>
