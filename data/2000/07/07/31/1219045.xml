        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Mr. Danforth's Verdict on Waco'' (editorial, July 25):</p>
        <p>I disagree that the F.B.I. should ''have been ordered to starve the cult out'' rather than assaulting the compound to bring an end to the 1993 standoff.</p>
        <p>The American people would never have stood by and allowed our government to starve innocent children, so, ultimately, food and water would have been delivered to the compound ''for the children,'' and David Koresh and his acolytes would have lived to fight another day.</p>
        <p>Discussing law enforcement ''should haves'' over this horrendous tragedy obscures these central facts: Everything that happened  at Waco was a direct result of  Mr. Koresh's refusal to accept service of a warrant and his and his followers' willingness to kill others and themselves on his behalf.</p>
