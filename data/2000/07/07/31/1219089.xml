        <p>American officials are putting strong pressure on the president of Montenegro and the leader of Serbia's largest opposition party to take part in Yugoslav elections called in September, according to Yugoslav politicians and Western officials.</p>
        <p>The American officials argue that a united opposition in Serbia, together with voters in Montenegro, Serbia's increasingly independent partner in the Yugoslav federation, would have a good chance of defeating President Slobodan Milosevic in the presidential and parliamentary elections he has called for Sept. 24.</p>

        <p>American officials are putting strong pressure on the president of Montenegro and the leader of Serbia's largest opposition party to take part in Yugoslav elections called in September, according to Yugoslav politicians and Western officials.</p>
        <p>The American officials argue that a united opposition in Serbia, together with voters in Montenegro, Serbia's increasingly independent partner in the Yugoslav federation, would have a good chance of defeating President Slobodan Milosevic in the presidential and parliamentary elections he has called for Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic and his allies have  begun a new wave of repression and altered the Constitution to create direct elections for his position -- which he otherwise would have to relinquish next July.</p>
        <p>The only time the opposition triumphed in past elections was when it united for municipal elections in 1996, winning in Belgrade and dozens of other cities. Mr. Milosevic initially refused to recognize the victories, setting off three months of protests.</p>
        <p>If the coming elections are manipulated or stolen, as expected, the Americans argue, the opposition will have another rallying cry for anti-Milosevic demonstrations. But a boycott provides no chance to beat Mr. Milosevic, they say, and a divided opposition has almost no chance to win.</p>
        <p>In late 1997, Milo Djukanovic broke with Mr. Milosevic and won the presidency in Montenegro. He has allied himself with the West, but is refusing to take part in the September elections, arguing that the constitutional changes were made without consultation with Montenegro and aim to reduce its influence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djukanovic's officials say that to take part in the elections would only ratify Mr. Milosevic's constitutional coup and legitimize the likely outcome -- a Milosevic victory, fair or otherwise.</p>
        <p>The changes to the Constitution have also removed previous requirements for a minimum turnout of half the eligible voters -- apparently to blunt any opposition boycott or the effect of widespread apathy among a generally depressed electorate.</p>
        <p>Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the largest single opposition party in Serbia, the Serbian Renewal Movement, says he will not take part in federal elections if Mr. Djukanovic will not. Mr. Draskovic also argues that the elections cannot be free and fair -- with attacks on opposition politicians, the judiciary, student protesters and government pressure on independent news media.</p>
        <p>The rest of Serbia's political opposition, largely grouped into the Alliance for Change, says it will take part, and is urging Mr. Draskovic to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic is almost sure to take part in the local elections, where his party has many seats and privileges to defend. A boycott of the elections would cause a revolt in his own party, Draskovic aides admit.</p>
        <p>A likely opposition presidential candidate is Vojislav Kostunica, a moderate nationalist who is considered free of corruption or of cooptation by the West -- distinguishing him from Mr. Draskovic or his great rival, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>In May, the government took over the Belgrade television station Mr. Draskovic controlled, Studio B, and prevented the independent radio station, B2-92, and two others from broadcasting in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>The government has been regularly suing the independent news media under a tough information law passed in October 1998 and has also restricted newsprint to major independent publications, particularly Blic, a popular tabloid whose circulation has been reduced by nearly half.</p>
        <p>And last week, in a trial that produced outrage domestically and internationally, a Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, was convicted by a military court in Nis on charges of espionage and sentenced to seven years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Filipovic, who works for the independent Belgrade publication Danas, Agence France-Presse and a London-based Internet site called the Institute for War and Peace Reporting, wrote a number of articles that annoyed the government, including one that cited an internal Yugoslav Army report on unhappiness and remorse over the brutal tactics used against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo -- tactics that caused Mr. Milosevic and four top aides to be indicted by an international tribunal on charges of war crimes.</p>
        <p>Unusually for a suspected spy, Mr. Filipovic signed his name to his articles, and no evidence was presented to indicate that he had secret contacts with any foreigner or intelligence agency.</p>
        <p>The government has also accused other independent journalists in Serbia of being spies and working on the orders of the Central Intelligence Agency or the same NATO countries that bombed Serbia last year, but in no case has provided evidence.</p>
        <p>While those forms of pressure are hardly new in Serbia, they are increasing and indicate pre-election nervousness in the Milosevic camp.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic is very shaky and obviously very concerned about these elections,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a Draskovic aide. ''His worry is not just because of the opposition, but because the situation in Serbia is disintegrating in every sense, economically and politically.''</p>
