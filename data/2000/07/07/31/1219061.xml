        <p>I arrived in this country on a Dutch freighter that had taken a month to get me from Singapore to San Pedro, the port of Los Angeles. They had to unlock the turnstile at the San Pedro streetcar station for me, as it hadn't been constructed with passengers toting large suitcases in mind. That was in the winter of 1951. I had spent a year in Indonesia as a radio journalist, but I never thought of myself as anything but a serious novelist: my first novel was planned and ready in my head.</p>
        <p>It was to be written in the first person, and the reader would learn about its protagonist only from his almost abstract thoughts about the human condition and his own life within it. That was my reaction against what I called to myself ''the two fingers of whiskey school of writing,'' in which reality is supposed to be pinned to the pages by a most detailed spelling out of its manifestations, as when we learn that the hero filled his glass with two fingers of scotch, a splash of soda, one slice of lemon and two ice cubes. (Different from most young writers I have since met, I didn't feel the slightest admiration for Ernest Hemingway.)</p>
        <p>When I started writing the novel, I found of course that the purity of the concept needed considerable dilution if I did not want it to become just an exhausting gimmick. Nonetheless it took me years to get the novel published.</p>
        <p>The second or third time of making the rounds, it ended up with Henry Robbins, then a junior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, and he took it. (Alfred had promised him autonomy and didn't stop him; but Alfred announced at his own sales conference that he hated the book.) That was ''The Affair,'' and it was very widely reviewed. I didn't realize this was unusual for a first novel.</p>
        <p>Dutch was my mother tongue, but I had been in the British Army and had started to think and dream in English. Dutch and English were close kin once. ''The Canterbury Tales'' often reads like Dutch. English has become marvelously richer of course, getting at its disposal not only the Germanic but also the Roman wellspring of words.</p>
        <p>My English was all right then; even those Westchester ladies who at that time, working at home, were the freelance and scholarly text editors for several New York publishing houses, found little to object. (I've often felt that starting out at the edge of the language, so to speak, was a blessing in disguise, because it gives you an awareness of words that is different from that of the native speaker, who, like Huckleberry Finn, may not think of, say, ''glove'' as one of the possible words for the thing but rather as the thing itself.)</p>
        <p>But there was a perceived European-ness about my novel that I had put in on purpose, and that stayed with me through the 12 novels I've written since. It was perceived as European by some editors and reviewers, but I did not think of it that way at all. It was the idea that a novel should be committed, what they call in France engage.</p>
        <p>The very fact that in English it is expressed by that awkward word committed shows that it's a qualification that plays little role in the American writing scene. It means to me that if you want to write a serious novel, you should not only be out to entertain but you should also, in a hidden way, reflect on the world's justice and injustice, hope and illusion.</p>
        <p>Trollope and Oscar Wilde agree with me here, not to mention Brecht or Garcia Lorca, but the very idea makes many reviewers nervous. They think it makes a novel political, which in their vocabulary becomes synonymous with tendentious. Some editors, and of late agents (who now often occupy terrain where once editors feared to tread) tell me that it is bad for sales and that I'd do better to replace it with ''a commercial core.''</p>
        <p>There is of course always the danger that all this committedness turns your novel into a lengthy pamphlet that bores, and then loses, your readers. But that danger is a challenge to your writing, not to the idea as such. In order for a novel to be engage, it isn't in the least necessary that it deals with a momentous subject. It does not have to deal with war and peace, love and death. It may be about a lottery swindle in Brooklyn or a suburban academic whose sex life is a shambles.</p>
        <p>What I believe it needs is evidence that its writer has gone through an awareness of the human condition, its comedy and melodrama, its mystery and tragedy. Isn't it that awareness that can give the crucial dimension to the most banal occurrences we may want to describe? It is not an awareness tied to a specific political ideology, and there is nothing specifically European about it, unless it be that so many American critics have expounded the thesis that ''true art is above politics,'' which is to say -- although they won't say it that way -- that it is committed to the status quo.</p>
        <p>No writer can float in a void above the battle; there are always links. There is a link between the potato famine and James Joyce's ''Ulysses.'' There is a link between the heroes and heroines of Henry James and the basics of their society; if they had to run off to 9-to-5 jobs, they would have lost most of their literary interest. There is even a link between the portraits of Rembrandt and the plundering of the Indies by the Dutch East India Company. To be above politics (politics in the widest sense) doesn't seem meritorious to me. I believe one can only be that way through total indifference to our world, or appalling incomprehension.</p>
        <p>When I used the term ''serious writing,'' I was not making a value judgment. I realize authors of nonserious novels achieve what they set out to achieve, and often with unsurpassed professionalism. Serious writing is not better; it has a different origin. It is writing that you have to write, what you hear in your mind.</p>
        <p>You don't inquire what is selling those days. You don't worry about what editors or reviewers may like or not like. (That comes afterward.) You don't read chapters to friends or to a long-suffering husband or wife in order to get an independent judgment. Your own judgment is independent. You don't accept any suggested change except where you made a factual or grammatical mistake. My motto has been through all those years: Not a comma.</p>
        <p>Please don't imagine that I think Jane Austen should really have introduced a battle of Napoleon or a strike of the Lancashire weavers in her stories. She lived at a time when, in the words of Saint-Just, human happiness was invented, and she wrote of and for men and women who had just become aware of their own unique destinies, which is why we are still interested in the marriage prospects of her heroines. That cult of the individual was precisely the essence of her time, and thus she became more strongly engaged to it than if she had bothered with Napoleon. That is not what we are about now, however. Perhaps the essence of our time is that we have to learn to look beyond our own individual lives.</p>
        <p>As for me, I keep aiming toward that novel that is just that, a true novel, but a novel for our time, dealing with an essential theme and an essential message in a subterranean, carefully hidden way, a message like a snake in the grass, as Trollope put it. There'll be no boy meets tractor, nor even a professor meets sophomore.</p>
        <p>A reader (and a reviewer) should find just as much in it as he or she is prepared to accept. Until one night, perhaps, when such a reader, for instance of my ''Kleber Plight,'' cannot get to sleep, and then suddenly the snake would raise its head, and he or she would start wondering if there was, after all, sense to what its hero (or antihero) was about on his destructive flight in that little Piper Tomahawk airplane. Or so I hope.</p>
