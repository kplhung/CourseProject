        <p>It was an exaggeration, but it made a point. All through the rain and the slop of the final day of the Lightpath Long Island Classic Senior PGA tournament today, it was a battle between Bruce Fleisher, Dana Quigley and Allen Doyle. They started the day as the leaders, were put together as a threesome, and finished 1-2-3.</p>
        <p>''Three guys,'' Quigley said, ''when we all turned 50 we were pretty much broke, and now we're out there competing for millions of dollars.''</p>

        <p>It was an exaggeration, but it made a point. All through the rain and the slop of the final day of the Lightpath Long Island Classic Senior PGA tournament today, it was a battle between Bruce Fleisher, Dana Quigley and Allen Doyle. They started the day as the leaders, were put together as a threesome, and finished 1-2-3.</p>
        <p>''Three guys,'' Quigley said, ''when we all turned 50 we were pretty much broke, and now we're out there competing for millions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>Fleisher's status as the Senior Tour's top money winner was enhanced with today's $225,000 winner's check thanks to his closing three-under-par 69, which gave him a three-day total of 198 and the victory at the Meadow Brook Club. His 18-under-par total -- a record for the Lightpath -- gave him two strokes on Quigley (who shot a 67 today) and three on Doyle (69).</p>
        <p>This continuing senior saga of second chances spotlighted those three -- but it has also been a boon for many others on the Tour. Fleisher, though, personifies what this tour has done for an assortment of players. He played on the regular PGA Tour for almost 30 years and won one tournament. He joined it after winning the United States Amateur title but then had limited success as a pro.</p>
        <p>As a senior, though, he was a rookie sensation with seven victories last year. And with four victories this season, he has vaulted to the earnings lead with more than $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>''Three guys without any pedigree -- without any credentials, certainly -- were competing for all that money,'' Quigley said. ''I guess you can call us Larry, Curly, Moe.''</p>
        <p>Quigley never earned $40,000 on the regular tour but has just passed the million-dollar mark for the third consecutive year as a senior.</p>
        <p>Yet for Fleisher, there was a tiredness about him after it was over. He said he had not been home for 10 weeks and had been looking forward to ending this tournament as soon as it began. He admitted that last year's seven victories -- bringing most of the $2.5 million he earned -- had taken a toll.</p>
        <p>''Today was not fun,'' he explained. ''I won today with my heart. I'm tired. I don't want to be overwhelmed by it, controlled by it, as I was last year.''</p>
        <p>Fleisher may have been playing down how well he performed in successfully defending the title he won as a rookie. But neither Quigley nor Doyle was having any of it. For Quigley, who entered the final round four strokes behind and said he planned to charge from the beginning, there was a disappointment on the par-5 first hole.</p>
        <p>''I started out real aggressive -- I hit a great drive over the trees on 1 and knocked it on the green in two -- and three-putted,'' he said. ''That kind of took a a little sting out of the way I felt.''</p>
        <p>Fleisher, meanwhile, eagled the par-5 third hole. His lead was never fewer than two strokes, and he was steady, if disappointing to himself.</p>
        <p>''It was wet, kind of sloppy, and when you're leading you have to prove to somebody you can do it,'' Fleisher said. ''These are the demons you deal with, thousands of people watching, people at home, all armchair quarterbacks.''</p>
        <p>Doyle, though, who started the day three back, saw none of that in Fleisher's game. Rather, he said: ''He's tough when he's in front. You knew you couldn't shoot three under and win.''</p>
        <p>Doyle, like Quigley, never won on the regular tour. But like Quigley, he will pass $1 million for this year alone.</p>
        <p>And why do players like these become such instant hits when they turn 50 and join the seniors? Quigley joined the group in 1997 and Doyle was a rookie last year.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we have a little more fire in the belly,'' Doyle said. ''Maybe the more famous players don't work as hard as we do. The three of us, when we were in our 40's, we were scrambling for places to play.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>BRUCE FLEISHER has won 10 of the 11 senior tournaments when he led or was tied for the lead on the final day. . . . On the Senior Tour, 51 percent of the events have been won by players in their first three years. No one over the age of 63 has ever won a senior event.</p>
