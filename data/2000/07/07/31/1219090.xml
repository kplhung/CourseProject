        <p>It did not take Ron Dixon long to win over the crowd at the Giants' intrasquad scrimmage Saturday on the campus of the State University at Albany.</p>
        <p>Before the scrimmage had even begun, during a special-teams exercise, Dixon, the Giants' surprise third-round draft pick from tiny Lambuth University, caught a kickoff and sprinted up the left sideline. When a defender closed in on him, Dixon faked right, did a 360-degree spin and accelerated to his left, flashing up the sideline untouched. It was a move that brought one of those audible gasps of awe from the grandstand -- followed by applause.</p>
        <p>Later, Dixon streaked downfield for a 17-yard reception, and later caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from the third-string quarterback, Mike Cherry.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Dixon did not act surprised by his performance -- even if others were.</p>
        <p>''This may seem like a coming-out party to you all,'' he said on the field to reporters. ''But I've been doing this since I was a child.''</p>
        <p>It was only a scrimmage, and for Dixon it was mostly against second-and third-team players. He also dropped a pass, ran at least one pass pattern awkwardly and needs some bulk on his 6-foot, 185-pound frame, but in 90 minutes of play Saturday, he gave a glimpse of why he has been welcomed warmly in camp by the Giants' veterans.</p>
        <p>They recognize talent when they see it.</p>
        <p>Those attending the scrimmage certainly came away knowing the Giants had a new No. 86. And they knew he was fast and explosive.</p>
        <p>''Ron Dixon has a nature about him,'' Coach Jim Fassel said. ''He's an exciting player with an instinct for big plays.''</p>
        <p>In less than two weeks of practice, it appears Dixon may have already vaulted over Brian Alford as the team's fourth wide receiver. That is significant because the Giants plan many more formations with four receivers this season. With the kickoff-return specialist Bashir Levingston injured, it is also quite likely Dixon will be the main kickoff-return man. He may also assume Tiki Barber's punt-return role because Barber's role in the offense has increased and the Giants may want to rest him.</p>
        <p>Dixon, who attended four schools during a six-year collegiate career, has been taking it all in stride.</p>
        <p>''The veterans keep asking me why I was playing at Lambuth instead of a bigger school,'' he said. ''I tell them all the same thing -- I made some misjudgments in my life.''</p>
        <p>Dixon, 24, acknowledges he was not much of a student until 1997. Out of school at the time and working a variety of jobs, he decided to dedicate himself to regaining his athletic eligibility. But he had used up his National Collegiate Athletic Association eligibility. He landed in Jackson, Tenn., at Lambuth, which plays in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.</p>
        <p>In one season at Lambuth, he dominated -- scoring 22 touchdowns in 11 games. He drew the notice of not only the Giants, but also the Jets, who flew Dixon in for an interview and a physical days before the draft this past April.</p>
        <p>Now Dixon is smoothly running past Giants cornerbacks, some of whom played at the biggest collegiate programs in the nation. In high school, Dixon said he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.27 seconds, though he concedes he has slowed some. The Giants timed him recently in 4.43.</p>
        <p>''He's amazing because he doesn't look like he's going fast, but he is,'' Barber said last week. ''He's like a gazelle.''</p>
        <p>Dixon also expects great things from his Giants career.</p>
        <p>Talking about his relationship with Giants fans after Saturday's scrimmage, he said: ''It's going to be a long-lasting love affair. Nobody knows who I am. But everyone is going to know eventually.''</p>
        <p>Dixon may sound cocky, but he has been generally quiet off the field at Giants camp. The veterans laugh at Dixon's infectious enthusiasm for the game -- he sometimes skips and hops on his way back to the huddle after plays in practice -- but they have taken him under wing. If Dixon can learn the nuances of his position and stay healthy, he could provide the Giants with something they have not had in years -- a playmaker.</p>
        <p>The Giants have talked about adding some kind of quick-strike capability. Ron Dixon could be it.</p>
        <p>''If a cornerback is up close on me and he's backpedaling,'' Dixon said,  ''it's over. If I get up beside him, he's not going to keep up. Even if he runs a 4.5, that won't be good enough against me.</p>
        <p>''You do the math.''</p>
