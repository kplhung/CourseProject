        <p>When the Rev. Billy Graham wanted to call attention to another religious figure not long ago, he took the relatively rare step among evangelists of singling out a woman: the second of his three daughters, Anne Graham Lotz.</p>
        <p>''This is what he said, that I'm the best preacher in the family,'' Mrs. Lotz said in an interview here, where she will be one of only two women on Monday to address a convention of 10,000 evangelists, overwhelmingly men, being sponsored this week by Mr. Graham's organization. ''I take that as my father's blessing on me, as my father's blessing on my ministry. And I'm humbled by it, and very grateful for it.''</p>

        <p>When the Rev. Billy Graham wanted to call attention to another religious figure not long ago, he took the relatively rare step among evangelists of singling out a woman: the second of his three daughters, Anne Graham Lotz.</p>
        <p>''This is what he said, that I'm the best preacher in the family,'' Mrs. Lotz said in an interview here, where she will be one of only two women on Monday to address a convention of 10,000 evangelists, overwhelmingly men, being sponsored this week by Mr. Graham's organization. ''I take that as my father's blessing on me, as my father's blessing on my ministry. And I'm humbled by it, and very grateful for it.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lotz, 52, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., does not have the public profile of her 48-year-old brother, Franklin, the designated successor to their father as the head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. But she has gained increasing visibility among evangelical Christians. She arrived here from England, where she had been the first woman in at least a century to speak to an annual Bible conference that draws thousands of British evangelicals.</p>
        <p>''A lot of places I go, I'm the first woman,'' she said. ''And I would pray that they're not inviting me because I'm a woman, but because of the message I bring.''</p>
        <p>The world of evangelical Christianity is geographically broad and can be ideologically diverse. But there is widespread resistance to the suggestion that Scripture might allow men and women an equal religious authority. In June, the Southern Baptist Convention revised its statement of faith to declare that the Bible does not permit a woman to serve as senior pastor of a church.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lotz does not challenge that. ''For myself,'' she said, ''I feel God has forbidden me to be ordained or be a senior pastor.''</p>
        <p>Instead, she calls herself a Bible teacher, and in that capacity she can draw a crowd. As the head of a small organization, AnGeL Ministries (the name incorporates her initials), she began this year to lead a series of two-day events called ''Just Give Me Jesus'' in arenas across the United States.</p>
        <p>The events are smaller than her father's ''crusades,'' which run for three or four days each, can draw upward of 100,000 people and are intended to convert people.</p>
        <p>Her events, she said, are intended to inspire born-again Christians to make a new commitment to their faith. By her estimate, 25,000 attended the first one, in April in Knoxville, Tenn. The next month, she spoke in a Fort Worth arena. Events are also planned this year for cities including Atlanta and San Diego.</p>
        <p>The events were at least partly inspired by recent experiences, she said. During the past two years, a fire destroyed the building where her husband, Dan, a dentist, had long had his office; her three children married within eight months; her mother, Ruth Graham, has been hospitalized several times and undergone hip replacement surgery; and her father, 81, has also been ailing.</p>
        <p>Asked if it was difficult being Billy Graham's daughter, she said no, and called him the best preacher around. ''It's harder to be Ruth Graham's daughter,'' Mrs. Lotz said with a laugh. She listed her mother's accomplishments: ''a very spiritual, very intellectual'' woman who paints, reads, knows music and talks easily with people.</p>
        <p>Asked whether she herself is conscious of breaking gender barriers, Mrs. Lotz said: ''Oh, sure. But that's not my goal.'' She said her goal was not to put women in ministry, but rather to ''set a high standard for presenting Bible teaching. In the end, it shouldn't matter if it's a man or a woman giving a message.''</p>
