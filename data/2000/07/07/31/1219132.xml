        <p>BETSY WERRONEN has heard most of the jokes before.</p>
        <p>The one about how being a Republican Party organizer in Washington is like being an air-conditioner repairman in Alaska.

        <p>BETSY WERRONEN has heard most of the jokes before.</p>
        <p>The one about how being a Republican Party organizer in Washington is like being an air-conditioner repairman in Alaska. Or how Republicans are outnumbered here like General Custer's scouts at Little Bighorn. Or how a Republican has as much chance of being elected mayor of the nation's capital as does Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Werronen, chairwoman of the D.C. Republican Committee, admits that when she took the job last month of running the party's local organization, ''people thought I was nuts -- some people think it's hopeless.''</p>
        <p>''You actually want to do this?'' she remembers being asked. ''Are you crazy?''</p>
        <p>During a quick trip home from Philadelphia, where she is leading the city's delegation to the Republican National Convention this week, she says that when she introduces herself to other convention delegates, ''some of them kind of roll their eyes'' when they hear that she is from what may be the Democratic Party's strongest urban stronghold.</p>
        <p>''We've got a real challenge,'' Mrs. Werronen says in a bit of the classic understatement that she learned after a career in both public relations and State Department diplomacy.</p>
        <p>''Are we going to deliver the District of Columbia for George W. Bush?'' she asks. ''No. But I would just love to bring the Republican vote up by a few percentage points.''</p>
        <p>In a city that is the workplace of many of the nation's most prominent Republican politicians, the local party seems barely to exist. In Washington, registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by more than 10 to 1, 256,300 Democrats versus 24,500 Republicans. There are many more registered independents in the city -- 45,800 -- than Republicans. In half of the city's eight wards, the Republicans are not contesting city council races this fall.</p>
        <p>The result is de facto one-party rule by the Democrats, which Mrs. Werronen says she is determined to change in her two-year term.</p>
        <p>Although they blame the federal government's meddling for many of the capital's problems, Democrats concede that their record of leadership here is a checkered one.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, the city became a symbol of urban decay. During 16 years in power, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who ran the Democratic machine until he retired last year, oversaw a city in which the school system and other services came close to collapse. Yet Mr. Barry was re-elected in 1994 even after serving a six-month prison term for drug use.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Werronen insists that as the crime rate and the abundant potholes seemed to push the city close to the abyss a few years ago, she never once thought of leaving.</p>
        <p>''When I came to Washington, D.C., I knew I was going to live in Washington, D.C.,'' says Mrs. Werronen, whose home is a 150-year-old town house in Georgetown, which she shares with her husband, Henry, and two cockerpoos.</p>
        <p>One of two children of a parks commissioner in Brookline, Mass., Mrs. Werronen, now 57, moved to Washington in 1965, the year she graduated from Boston College and went to work for the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>From 1968 until 1975, she worked for Senator Edward W. Brooke, the Massachusetts Republican. For most of the 1980's, she worked at the State Department, where for a time she oversaw Congressional relations. In 1989, she founded a public relations and consulting firm. She married her husband, a health care consultant and art collector, seven years ago.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Werronen says the city's traditional Democratic voters should be open to the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>''I really do feel that the Democratic Party has failed many of the people they tried to help in this city,'' she said. ''And Bush is different. He is inclusive. Sure, he's got some very conservative positions, but he is inclusive.''</p>
        <p>An early backer of Mr. Bush, she says that she disagrees with him on a central issue. While the party platform seeks a ban on abortions, she favors abortion rights. ''I think that politically and legally you've got to have choice,'' she said. ''But there's not going to be any candidate that anyone can support on 100 percent of the issues.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Werronen admits that part of the Republican Party's problem here is one of image. ''And that's our fault,'' she says. In a city that is two-thirds black, some people perceive Republicans here as ''lily-white little old ladies in tennis shoes.''</p>
        <p>So Mrs. Werronen has decided to move local party gatherings out of mostly white neighborhoods to churches and other gathering points in neighborhoods populated mostly by blacks. ''We've got to get out there,'' she says. ''We're going to get people out there and talk to them.''</p>
        <p>THE party has established a Web site (www.dcgop.com), and it has stepped up fund-raising efforts, allowing the committee's annual budget to grow to $130,000 this year from about $50,000 two years ago. In the past, she said, ''there had been a tendency not to ask individuals for money because they all thought it was going down a rat hole.''</p>
        <p>And she is trying to reach out to other constituencies, including the city's powerful Asian-American, Hispanic and gay voters.</p>
        <p>Asked if she can imagine a Republican mayor of Washington someday, she says ''absolutely'' and then singles out a likely candidate, David Catania, a popular member of the city council who happens to be gay. ''I'm a big-tent Republican,'' she says. ''We've got a little bit of everything in our party, and I want them all to be comfortable.''</p>
