        <p>If there was any doubt that the Republicans were reaching out to new constituencies this year, consider the celebrity to whom they have given the honor of delivering the introduction on Wednesday night of the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert.</p>
        <p>He goes by a stage name, The Rock, and for a living, he hammers opponents in a ring. The idea of this World Wrestling Federation superstar, he of the mighty build and signature arched eyebrow, hobnobbing onstage with heavyweights of the Grand Old Party is but one sign that in terms of unity of message and showbiz pizazz, these proceedings will diverge in marked ways from past conventions.</p>
        <p>In fact, the most repeated phrase from party officials and convention planners here in recent days is not the convention's official slogan -- ''Renewing America's Purpose. Together'' -- but ''This is a different kind of convention.''</p>
        <p>It would be hard to get less Republican than The Rock, a New Media star who would seem as unlikely a presence on stage at the First Union Center as Trent Lott, the Republican Senate majority leader, would be as a house guest on ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>And that is exactly the idea. The bridge the Republicans wanted to build was not so much to the 21st Century as to 20th Century Fox and its ilk. The energy of the media age in all its manifestations -- music, film, video, the Web and even as embodied by prime-time professional wrestling -- is the feel the Republicans were after. And it is lost on no one here that a pro wrestler by the name of Jesse Ventura ignited the imaginations of Minnesota voters and won the governorship as a third-party candidate.</p>
        <p>The Republicans seem to have concluded that most Americans dwell in this multimedia-driven, pop cultural world, as opposed to in the sharper-edged political one conjured by what many in the party have come to view as the off-putting ideological shows put on before. At the 1992 gathering, for example, speeches by hard-right proponents like Patrick J. Buchanan left a bad taste in the mouths of many voters.</p>
        <p>''You want people to come away with the feeling that Governor Bush is going to do things a little bit differently,'' said Russell Schriefer, a Bush media consultant who has been working on the convention videos and programs for months.</p>
        <p>But when Republicans say ''different,'' they really subtly mean something else. They are trying to say that by being different onstage here, they are acting more like the voting majority.</p>
        <p>The message is being managed to such a degree that the same mantras are repeated over and over by various officials, as if the candidate and his minions were circulating them on some high-security e-mail.</p>
        <p>''He's a new kind of leader, and this is a different kind of convention,'' the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, said Saturday on ''Larry King Live,'' an almost verbatim repetition of the favorite sound bite of the convention's general co-chairman, Andy Card.</p>
        <p>The convention's program is another reflection of the lock-step approach to message management. On Monday night, for instance, when the focus on the stage turns to education issues, so will the satellite feed to three jumbo Liquid Crystal Display screens. The image of Gov. George W. Bush, speaking live at a school event in Ohio, will be beamed into the First Union Center. On Tuesday,  when the program calls for talk of defense policy -- and a speech by a war hero, Senator John McCain of Arizona -- Mr. Bush is again to appear by satellite, from a site brimming with military symbolism: Gettysburg, Pa.</p>
        <p>For each night's program, there will be a heavy emphasis on narrative flow and emotional crescendo: ''Most of the lighthearted moments are early in the evening, and the evenings will build,'' Mr. Schriefer said. Indeed, at a planning meeting here last week, Mr. Card and his staff, many with extensive experience in producing television shows, went painstakingly through charts of each night's prime-time offerings, blocked out in five-minute segments, from 7:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.</p>
        <p>If the session had the feel of a meeting of network programmers, it was intentional: this convention is expected to put to rest any pretense the party had to producing anything but a television spectacle. In fact, the ''show'' begins much the way an Emmy or Oscar special might commence: from a remote location, using actors, and the stage has been designed to look as if it were intended as much for Brooks and Dunn, a country-western group, as for Jennifer Dunn, a Republican House member from Washington who is to have a featured role one evening. (Mr. Schriefer pointed proudly to the drum kit that will remain prominently in view, stage left.)</p>
        <p>As explained by Republican officials, the production will begin with a satellite feed from Carpenters' Hall, part of the historic Independence Hall complex in Philadelphia's Olde  City, where an actor in Colonial garb will ring in the convention.</p>
        <p>An actor playing Thomas Jefferson will also be featured, and a few moments later a camera in the First Union Center will focus on Paul C. Harris Sr., a Virginia state assemblyman who occupies the seat once held by Jefferson. Mr. Harris happens to be black.</p>
        <p>The thrust is not universally appreciated. Among others, Richard Lowry, the editor of the National Review, a conservative journal, appeared on CNN the other night to express disappointment that the issues of the day are being shoved out of the television picture. And Democrats are clearly trying to cloud the upbeat focus on Mr. Bush with a 17-state advertising campaign criticizing the Congressional voting record of his running mate, Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>But Republicans who have been pushing for a mainstream appeal seem buoyant. ''An inclusive message is a winning message,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist group based in Washington. Even a former adversary, Greg Stevens, who was Mr. McCain's media consultant during the primaries, said that he was impressed by how faithfully the Bush camp had tried to marry Mr. Bush's personal style to the convention's themes.</p>
        <p>''People want to like who they vote for,'' Mr. Stevens said. ''And their greatest advantage is the likability factor.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans appear to have niceness at the top of their list. ''The problem Republicans have had in the past is we've been all serious,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''It didn't look like we were having fun.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone wants to see The Rock. The party hopes it has taken care of that, too. The first night will close with a black and white appearance on the screens of that icon of the past, Kate Smith.</p>
