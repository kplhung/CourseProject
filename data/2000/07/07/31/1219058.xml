        <p>Lauren Slater is a self-professed liar. But this time she really wants you to believe her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Slater, a 36-year-old psychologist in Boston, is the author of the recently released ''Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir.'' The book is billed as a memoir but is actually a blending of fact and fiction, in which the main character, Ms. Slater, thinks she has epilepsy but may be imagining her condition.</p>
        <p>The book begins with a preface written by a Dr. Hayward Krieger, Ph.D., who is described as a philosophy professor at the University of Southern California. He calls the memoir ''a new kind of Heideggerian truth, the truth of the liminal.''</p>
        <p>Some reviewers, including Rebecca Mead in The New York Times Book Review, found Dr. Krieger a bit much. She called the university, found there was no Dr. Krieger, and described the stunt and the book as ''unrewardingly wearing.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Slater was not quite done. Last week, The Times Book Review received a letter to the editor from Dr. Krieger. ''Identity has always been a fragile phenomenon,'' the letter admonished, ''but that it now rests upon the report of overworked operators at a university switchboard is perturbing, and we should all beware.''</p>
        <p>The letter reported that Dr. Krieger had merely left the university. The return address was Ms. Slater's Boston clinic, along with a phone number belonging to her husband. There is no Dr. Krieger.</p>
        <p>Carol Schneider, executive director of publicity for Random House, which published Ms. Slater's book, said she is not sure if Ms. Slater's editors knew that Dr. Krieger was a fiction. They are unavailable for comment, but Ms. Slater says they knew. Ms. Schneider says she finds the letter ''pretty amusing,'' adding that it was clever publicity for the book.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Slater insists she had no such intentions. ''Publicity?'' she said. ''I am shocked. I can't believe anyone would say that. I know it is hard to believe me, but I am being totally honest with you -- I just thought that letter was very, very funny. I was sure that whoever gets it at the time would think Lauren Slater is immature and throw it away. You have got to believe me.'' Her next book, she says, will be true nonfiction, about the effect of prescription drugs during pregnancy.</p>
