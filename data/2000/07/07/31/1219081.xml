        <p>If we are to believe what has been written about the Camp David talks, they collapsed not because of an outdated idea of holiness, but rather an outdated idea of sovereignty.</p>
        <p>What was held sacred was a principle of exclusive legal jurisdiction that not a single European state exercises today, and that neither a Palestinian state nor Israel would be able to exercise under any workable peace agreement. Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, have long conceded this in the way they have framed and resolved standing security issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat came tantalizingly close to a deal in an explosive environment that could be ignited by failure. With both sides saying they want more talks, and scheduling meetings, can we not hope for them to move beyond a claim of sovereignty in East Jerusalem that can never be anything but quaint?</p>
        <p>Just think of Bethlehem, as close to the Jewish Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot as the Metropolitan Museum is to Lincoln Center in Manhattan. Formally, the Palestinian Authority has ''full'' sovereignty there.</p>
        <p>But during the last Christmas season, festive lights stretched along the road from Talpiot to Bethlehem in a continuous stream, leading tourists into Manger Square, making it nearly impossible to determine where the border checkpoints were. When I visited, twice, after dark, Israeli and Palestinian border guards were casual, waving cars through and giving directions.</p>
        <p>In Bethlehem, Palestinian hoteliers and shopkeepers scrubbed buildings and streets while Israeli technicians helped construct the Manger Square stage and satellite uplinks for a telecast from the Church of the Nativity.</p>
        <p>None of this seemed in the slightest utopian. It was natural -- no, necessary -- for the governments of Jerusalem and Bethlehem (each run by ostensible hard-liners) to cooperate on tourism. It was a division of labor expressing the commercial interests of hundreds of entrepreneurs, some local, some global. Nor was this at odds with the political background; it was part of an inevitable trend.</p>
        <p>The Israeli Army and the Palestinian police have regularly consulted to keep the peace, though Israelis know that if serious trouble were started by Palestinian radicals, the Israeli Army would be in the wings, and the Palestinians know that the Palestine Liberation Organization  and Arab governments have made common cause with the Israeli government against West Bank Jewish extremists.</p>
        <p>The working together is just common sense, and common people know it. Even if cold peace is the fate of Israelis and Palestinians for the coming generation, cooperation of this kind will be the tip of the iceberg. What jurisdictions, after all, could either side exercise without the formal cooperation of the other?</p>
        <p>Water is getting dangerously scarce. If a Palestinian state is formed along the expected lines, neither side will be able to pump from the West Bank water table without affecting the other. And many plans for bringing water from farther away envision pipelines or canals  that would pass through both Arab and Israeli territories, requiring the same sort of cooperation competing interests in the American West had to develop after the building of Hoover Dam.</p>
        <p>Israel and a Palestinian state will have to work together on roads and commercial links between the West Bank and Gaza, and, if the regional economy is to be efficient, on labor law and standards, monetary policy (the Israeli shekel is still the major Palestinian currency), immigration, telecommunications policy (bandwidth is even scarcer than water) and more.</p>
        <p>As Cyrus Vance pointed out after the first Camp David summit in 1978,  Americans believe that sovereignty ''derives from the consent of the governed.'' By that standard, Palestinians would have claim to formal sovereignty over their neighborhoods in Jerusalem, just as Jews now have it over theirs.</p>
        <p>And if Prime Minister Barak has already agreed that the Haram al-Sharif, or Temple Mount, in the Old City of Jerusalem should be formally Palestinian, why shouldn't the Palestinian Arab shops selling olive-wood carvings and other souvenirs nearby? The point is, nothing like exclusive political control of any of these territories would be sustainable or even desirable, short of mass movements of populations.</p>
        <p>It is easy to see why the nuanced limitations of political sovereignty can be lost on some Palestinians and Israelis. Israelis in their 50's remember an Old City they could not enter, dangled before their eyes by the Hashemite king; Palestinians of all ages hate Israeli checkpoints and searches, which became common with the intifada.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak have reportedly agreed that the city should be free and open to citizens of both states and to all religions, so that Jews would go to the Western Wall under a declaration of peace and Arab leaders would return solemnly, triumphantly to Al-Aqsa mosque.</p>
        <p>So what exactly explains the stall? Why does East Jerusalem pose a problem that Bethlehem does not?</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is time for the leaders of the European Community to join President Clinton in helping Israelis and Palestinians think about the transnational institutions and global markets the two states can share to get on with their lives -- to help them understand that a place like Quebec cannot be made to look like a place like Japan.</p>
        <p>Only one turn of events would absolutely guarantee a divided and closed city; it would come overnight not only in Jerusalem, but around Bethlehem too, if the current stall led to violence. But that would be as unthinkable as Europeans plunging into total war over the killing of an archduke by a citizen of not-quite-sovereign Serbia.</p>
