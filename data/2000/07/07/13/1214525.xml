        <p>In unusually blunt language, Pentagon officials today acknowledged the failure of their ambitious policy to inoculate all military personnel against the deadly anthrax virus.</p>
        <p>At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, witnesses described blunder after blunder in the Pentagon's two-and-a-half year program. The most severe was a shortage of the vaccine caused by the mismanagement and financial problems of the only company licensed to produce it -- a company in which a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff controls an 11 percent stake.</p>
        <p>Simply put, the hearing highlighted the anatomy of a failure. ''There are not immediate fixes,'' Maj. Gen. Randall L. West of the Marines, a senior Pentagon adviser on chemical and biological defense, said.</p>
        <p>''We've got a crisis situation,'' Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican and chairman of the committee, replied tersely. He urged the Pentagon to ''sit down with these folks'' at the BioPort Corporation, the troubled company based in Lansing, Mich., that makes the vaccine, and buy them out.</p>
        <p>As a result of the vaccine shortage, the Pentagon is seeking a second drug company to make it. Thus far, officials said, there have been no takers. And even if a second supplier  agreed to take on the daunting task, it would take from two to four years to begin production, they added.</p>
        <p>And because producing the vaccine is not very commercially profitable, the Pentagon will also decide by the end of the month whether to build its own plant, a process that would take five to seven years.</p>
        <p>Senator Tim Hutchinson, Republican of Arkansas, called it a ''mystery to this day'' why the Pentagon had not built its own plant.</p>
        <p>With much fanfare in late 1997, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen announced a plan to inoculate all 2.4 million active and reserve military personnel by 2003, because of the perceived threat of a biological weapons attack; though no country has used anthrax in battle, the Pentagon says 10 have the capability to make biological weapons. To prove his confidence in the safety of the vaccine, Mr. Cohen rolled up his sleeve for a full series of six shots.</p>
        <p>Since then, about 445,000 military personnel have received at least one dose of the vaccine. But on Tuesday, the Pentagon said that because of dwindling stocks of the vaccine, it was curtailing the program to cover only military personnel it considered most at risk: those deployed near the borders of Iraq and North Korea.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials said today that the number of vaccinations it administered would drop from 75,000 a month to 14,000. Earlier this week, General West said the Pentagon only had 165,000 doses of the vaccine left.  While not offering a revised schedule for vaccinating all military personnel, officials today restated their intent to complete the program.</p>
        <p>Deputy Secretary of Defense Rudy de Leon called the anthrax threat ''immediate, real and constant.'' And when asked after the hearing whether the Pentagon was still committed to inoculate every man and woman on active or reserve duty, Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ''Absolutely.''</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials insist that the decision to curtail the inoculations had nothing to do with concerns among some service members that the vaccine is unsafe and can produce adverse reactions.</p>
        <p>The witnesses today insisted that the vaccine was safe to take. Of two million doses given since 1990, 1,404 adverse reactions have been reported. Of those, 73 were considered ''fatal, life-threatening or resulting in hospitalization or permanent disability,'' according to Kathryn C. Zoon, a senior biological weapons and vaccine expert for the Food and Drug Administration. But she said that none of those cases ''can be attributed to the vaccine with a high level of confidence.''</p>
        <p>Between 200 and 300 military personnel have refused to take the vaccine, questioning its safety and the legal right of the Pentagon to force them to submit to the injections.</p>
        <p>Anthrax bacteria generally afflicts animals, especially sheep and cattle. But dry anthrax spores can be turned into weapons and are particularly dangerous because anthrax is a colorless, odorless, tasteless agent that can kill after it is inhaled only once.</p>
        <p>Manufacture of the vaccine was halted in December after the F.D.A. found dozens of violations in safety, consistency, record-keeping and sterility in an inspection of the BioPort plant in Lansing, Mich. Retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is an unpaid member of the BioPort board and controls an 11 percent stake in it.</p>
        <p>The plant is scheduled to renew production after the F.D.A. gives final approval that the violations have been corrected.</p>
        <p>According to a Pentagon audit completed in March, BioPort forecast a possible $18 million shortfall this year. Initially, the company sold the Pentagon the vaccine at $2.26 or $4.36 a dose, depending on the year of manufacture. The price jumped to $10.64 a dose last August as part of a deal that raised the Pentagon contract by $24 million, including an $18 million advance to help keep the company afloat.</p>
