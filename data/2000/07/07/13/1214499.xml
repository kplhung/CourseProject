        <p>Here's the thing you need to know about Sandra Marsh, who is 57 years old and a lawyer: She did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing.</p>
        <p>And yet Howard Safir and his boys ruthlessly destroyed her career and forced her out of the Police Department, where she had spent 13 years doing work that was valuable and that she loved.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh was the deputy commissioner responsible for handling complaints of employment harassment when she left the department in 1998. She had served with distinction under five police commissioners. She was the department's highest-ranking black official, and the only black deputy commissioner.</p>
        <p>Former Police Commissioner William Bratton, in a telephone conversation yesterday, said: ''I thought a lot of her and the staff she had there. She had an extraordinarily difficult assignment, and my experience with her was excellent.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh's problems started with a particularly bitter sexual harassment case that erupted in Staten Island in 1997. There were complaints that female police officers had been harassed, that they had been punished for filing complaints, and that retaliatory action had been taken against other officers who offered support for the original complainants.</p>
        <p>The case was investigated by Ms. Marsh and her staff. She said in her report that she had been unable to substantiate the sexual harassment claims. But she also found that the case had been improperly handled, and that top officials in the department had indeed engaged in retaliation, and had tried to impede her investigation.</p>
        <p>The report specifically criticized Assistant Chief Eugene Devlin, the Staten Island police commander, and his second in command, Deputy Chief Phil Erickson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh's career was not doomed at that point. She was on shaky ground, but her boss, Commissioner Safir, gave her an opportunity to recover. All she had to do was revise her findings. In short, take the heat off the chiefs.</p>
        <p>Eugene Devlin and Phil Erickson were big shots in the department, fair-haired boys with powerful connections and thus big-time clout. They didn't outrank Ms. Marsh, who reported directly to Commissioner Safir, but they might as well have. Their toes were not to be stepped on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir ordered the case reinvestigated, and it was made clear that a different result was desired.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh did reinvestigate the case. But the only way she could have saved herself was to betray herself.</p>
        <p>''She went back and honestly re-evaluated the case,'' said her lawyer, Richard Emery. ''And she came up with the same results. And then they crushed her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh and her top aide, a police captain, had to give an oral report of the results of the second investigation. In an interview this week, Ms. Marsh said, ''We mistakenly thought that once they saw the evidence, and once they understood how we reached this decision, that they would understand and all of this would go away.''</p>
        <p>She was so wrong. Mr. Safir, furious, stopped meeting with her and stopped talking to her. He ordered the investigation done yet again, but not by Ms. Marsh. That investigation dutifully cleared Chief Devlin and Chief Erickson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh's top aide was transferred to a post in Queens, working nights. A new aide was imposed on Ms. Marsh, and he began running -- and even remodeling -- her office.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh's career was over.</p>
        <p>''I was still the deputy commissioner,'' she said, ''but I wasn't being consulted about anything.''</p>
        <p>She left the department in September 1998.</p>
        <p>Her case was taken up by Mr. Emery, an old friend who founded the law firm Emery Cuti Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady as a vehicle to -- among other things -- curb the abuse of governmental power. This case, so clearly outrageous, was a natural.</p>
        <p>They sued. And they won.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago the city agreed to pay Ms. Marsh $1 million to settle the suit.</p>
        <p>The money will not resurrect her ruined career in the Police Department, or undo the hurt, the sadness or the emotional devastation that resulted from the cruel and unconscionable way she was treated.</p>
        <p>But the white flag of a settlement was a signal, in some sense, that what happened to Sandra Marsh was indefensible. That it was wrong.</p>
