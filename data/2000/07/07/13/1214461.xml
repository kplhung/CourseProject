        <p>Caring for Fuchsia</p>
        <p>Q. I just purchased my first fuchsia, an expensive, beautiful all red one. How do I care for it? Should the ends be cut back after the blooms at the bottom fall off? Can cuttings be taken in the fall for the following year?</p>
        <p>A. Congratulations! Only 7,999 more and you'll have almost all the varieties. Meanwhile, keep the plant in a warm, semishaded place, out of the wind. While it's blooming, feed it every other week with a half-strength solution of balanced fertilizer. Water just enough so that the soil stays evenly moist.</p>

        <p>Caring for Fuchsia</p>
        <p>Q. I just purchased my first fuchsia, an expensive, beautiful all red one. How do I care for it? Should the ends be cut back after the blooms at the bottom fall off? Can cuttings be taken in the fall for the following year?</p>
        <p>A. Congratulations! Only 7,999 more and you'll have almost all the varieties. Meanwhile, keep the plant in a warm, semishaded place, out of the wind. While it's blooming, feed it every other week with a half-strength solution of balanced fertilizer. Water just enough so that the soil stays evenly moist.</p>
        <p>Fuchsias bloom from spring to fall, but always on new growth. As each branch stops flowering, cut it back to a strong node (where you see incipient branches forming at the base of both leaves). The plant will  put out fresh branches and, in a month, another round of flowers.</p>
        <p>If your fuchsia was in a greenhouse and is now outside, don't be surprised if it needs cutting back quite soon. The rude shock of fresh air often makes these coddled beauties drop some of their flowers. It's disappointing but not a disaster; the plant will recover as soon as it adjusts. Repotting often has the same effect, so don't repot unless the roots are so crowded no soil is left.</p>
        <p>Fuchsia cuttings root easily in spring and fairly well in fall. Choose strong growing tips about four inches long that have three or four pairs of leaves.</p>
        <p>Clip off the set of leaves nearest the cut, and remove any flower buds. Dip the ends of the cuttings in commercial rooting hormone (available at garden centers), and insert them in a bed of moist sand or vermiculite. Make sure the node where you removed the leaves is buried.</p>
        <p>Keep the cuttings out of the sun. Water from the bottom so they aren't jostled. Don't overwater; rot is the most common cause of failure. The cuttings should make roots in six weeks to two months. When they do, pot them up promptly.</p>
        <p>Raspberry Pests</p>
        <p>Q. We have had a large patch of black raspberries along the back fence of our yard for years. Recently, I noticed that the undersides of the leaves of many of the plants were infested with tiny white insects, causing the afflicted plants to turn yellow. They don't seem to attack the fruit, but they're difficult to wash off when they are on the berries. How can we treat these, short of ripping out the whole patch?</p>
        <p>A. The insects might be glacial whiteflies, white apple leafhoppers or any of several kinds of aphid, assuming, of course, that they're not some variety of scale.</p>
        <p>There are two possible solutions, each of which will eliminate a multitude of bad actors. One is to spray with dormant oil in early spring, before the canes leaf out. If your predators are overwintering as eggs  on the plants, this will probably smother them into submission.</p>
        <p>The second solution is radical cleanup, especially important if you have not been cutting out the fruiting canes each year after they finished  bearing. Bramble patches that grow untended for long periods often ''suddenly'' fall prey to diseases or insect infestations that have actually been building up for years.</p>
        <p>This fall, cut all canes to the ground. Rake up everything, and burn or bury it. While you're in housekeeping mode, get rid of perennial weeds like dandelions. After hard frost, mulch around the stubs of the plants with a 10-inch layer of straw, salt hay, compost, composted manure or any combination of these.</p>
        <p>Next spring, thin each plant to the three or four strongest canes. When they're about four feet tall, cut off the top eight inches or so to force fruit-bearing side branches. Black raspberries fruit on year-old wood, so next summer will be berry-free, but in 2002, you should get a bug-free, bumper crop.</p>
