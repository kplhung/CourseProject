        <p>A man charged in the 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa is asking a federal judge in Manhattan to suppress statements he made after his arrest, saying he was the victim of coercive police tactics over nearly three weeks of sustained interrogation in Pakistan and Kenya.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, also contends in a newly filed court affidavit that law enforcement officials from the United States who were investigating the bombings cooperated with the Kenyan authorities ''to get the information they wanted, by using both direct and indirect threats.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh, a Jordanian citizen, has been charged in the bombings of the United States Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7, 1998, which killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 4,000.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have said that Mr. Odeh, who has pleaded not guilty, made statements to the authorities accepting responsibility for the attacks, admitting that he gave technical advice and other assistance to the bombers in Tanzania, and saying he was a member of a group led by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the authorities suspect of masterminding the attacks and other acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Odeh, who faces trial next January with five codefendants, contends in his four-page affidavit that his statements to the authorities overseas were not voluntary. His lawyers have asked Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan to bar prosecutors from using the statements at trial.</p>
        <p>The filing by Mr. Odeh's lawyers is one of at least two made so far seeking suppression of statements in the case. Another defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, said in a three-page affidavit that he gave a statement to American interrogators in Germany only after he was deprived of food, asthma medication and a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. in New York would not discuss the allegations yesterday. Of the allegations by Mr. Odeh, Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for United States Attorney Mary Jo White, said: ''It is a pending motion. We will be fully responding to the allegations in our answering papers to be filed with the court.''</p>
        <p>A. Rashid Chaudhry, press attache for the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, called the charges of misconduct by Pakistani interrogators ''false and baseless.''</p>
        <p>The Kenyan Embassy issued a short statement that did not address Mr. Odeh's specific allegations but said that Kenya's constitution expressly prohibited the subjecting of any person to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh, who was arrested in an airport in Pakistan on the day of the bombings, was questioned for seven days in that country without Americans present, his lawyers said in court papers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh said in his affidavit that he was ''subjected to violence, threats of torture, psychological coercion, sleep deprivation, and other inhumane conditions'' by his captors. His lawyers said in their papers that they had been given a videotape of Mr. Odeh's interrogation in Pakistan, adding that the tape appeared to have been edited by the Pakistanis ''to remove evidence of their improper interrogation techniques.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh was next flown to Kenya and questioned there for 12 days, his lawyers said. His Kenyan interrogators were joined by an American prosecutor and F.B.I. agents. Mr. Odeh's lawyers contend that in Kenya, American law enforcement agents  controlled the formal interrogation of Mr. Odeh at all times.</p>
        <p>In his affidavit, Mr. Odeh said that the Americans periodically left him alone with the Kenyans, ''who threatened to torture and kill me.''</p>
        <p>Once, his lawyers said, the Kenyans, out of the presence of the Americans, threatened to take him to a garden in the city, ''tell the people that he was responsible for the bombing, and allow them to cut him to pieces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh said the American agents told him that if he insisted on having a lawyer, they would leave him alone with the Kenyan interrogators, who he believed would torture him. ''I felt I had no choice but to sign the piece of paper giving up my rights,'' Mr. Odeh said.</p>
        <p>One of his lawyers, Sandra L. Babcock, said, ''Courts recognize that when a defendant is subjected to these types of coercive techniques, he'll say anything to get the interrogation to stop.''</p>
        <p>Yale Kamisar, a University of Michigan law professor and a leading expert on confessions, said that if threats were made, the issue of admissibility would turn on whether there was collusion or cooperation between American agents and foreign agents.</p>
        <p>Even without such collusion, he added, if the Americans knew of any unacceptable tactics by the foreign agents, the Americans were obligated to reassure the suspect ''that from this point on, he would be treated in a civilized manner.'' The administering of Miranda warnings alone, Professor Kamisar said, ''would not be sufficient because they were not designed to deal with a suspect who might have been previously threatened with violence or torture.''</p>
        <p>Judge Sand has not yet said when he will rule on the suppression requests.</p>
