      <abstract>
        <p>Mike Stoller letter says it is not fair that he and other songwriters and the musicians who perform their music are deprived of royalties due on recordings that are downloaded with with the aid of Napster (June 29 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter H. Lewis said he went looking for ''Jailhouse Rock'' and had it on his computer within five minutes. Napster says that's not illegal, but those of us whose livelihood depends on our copyrights say it is illegal, and we are prepared to fight to defend our position. Regardless of the outcome of this dispute, the question remains: Is it fair?</p>
        <p>Jerry Leiber and I wrote ''Jailhouse Rock'' and quite a few other songs recorded by Elvis Presley (including ''Hound Dog''), not to mention many songs recorded by other wonderful performers, many still living, who receive nothing when their performances are downloaded with the aid of Napster. The article failed to mention that Napster also deprives music publishers and songwriters like ourselves compensation for use of our property.</p>

        <p>If the miracles of modern technology that created MP3 and Napster and their clones could enable copyright owners and creators to enter the homes of Napster owners and users undetected, would it then be legal for us to take their books, videos and CD's -- and while we're at it, their silverware, too?</p>
