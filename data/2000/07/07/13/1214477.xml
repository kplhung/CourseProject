        <p>Shutterbugs with a passion for instantly shared experiences will soon be able to send their digital photos by e-mail without ever touching their computers. Wireless photo transmission is being made possible by Digita Post software currently available in Kodak DC290 digital cameras.</p>
        <p>The software, developed by FlashPoint Technology, based in San Jose, Calif., works with the company's Digita technology, which functions as an operating system for digital cameras.</p>
        <p>Transmitting photos from digital cameras to cell phones and then to any e-mail box anywhere in the world is expected to be particularly handy for insurance adjusters, police officers and paramedics, though the biggest market for the cameras is expected to be among nonprofessionals, said Karen Meyers, a company spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>A user inserts a flash card into the camera and takes  standard digital photos. Then the user starts up the camera's Digita Post software, which allows the user to select which photos to send and even attach text and sound messages (the Kodak DC290 has a tiny microphone).</p>
        <p>The camera is then connected to a cell phone through a cable. With another click, the photos are on their way. They arrive in the receiver's e-mail In box as a message with an attached JPEG file. Sounds arrive as WAV file attachments.</p>
        <p>Digita Post is expected to cost $199 and will be available in late September on the FlashPoint Web site (www.flashpoint.com).</p>
        <p>Other camera manufacturers that offer Digita-enabled cameras -- including Minolta, Hewlett-Packard and Sharp -- are expected to incorporate the Digita Post software, too, Ms. Meyers said.</p>
