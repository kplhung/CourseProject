        <p>Comment on Kristin Hein's hand-screened wallpaper panels inspired by Japanese kimonos from 1920's and 30's and on Restoration hardware's raffia-wrapped Chianti bottles that can be used as candleholders (Currents); photos (S)</p>

        <p>Supergraphics and Chianti bottles with dripping candles? Why not? Some of you have heard about the 1960's, others may want to revisit them, a time when colors were vibrant and decorating was fun -- and affordable. Kristin Hein's hand-screened wallpaper panels were inspired by Japanese kimonos from the 1920's and 30's. The 24-inch-square papers, in cranes or butterflies, can be applied with vinyl wallpaper adhesive. They are $45 a square from the Room catalog, (888) 420-7666, or at Room's first New York store, opening at 182 Duane Street (Hudson Street) on July 25.</p>

        <p>The best thing about Restoration Hardware's raffia-wrapped Chianti bottles is that they come without the cheap wine. Perfect for a Night in Tuscany party in the retro basement rec room (or in the chic TriBeCa loft), the bottles are $3 each, and two candles (guaranteed to drip profusely) are $2.25 from www.restorationhardware.com, or (800) 762-1005.</p>
