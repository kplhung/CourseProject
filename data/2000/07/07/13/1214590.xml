        <p>Now that typing rhythms are being used as a way to validate passwords (''New Encryption Strategy: Typing Rhythm,'' June 29), we should remember that the idea of identifiable typing rhythms is even older than modern computing. According to ''The Codebreakers,'' by David Kahn (Scribner, 1996), the identities of members of the underground working behind Axis lines during World War II were validated by handlers who were familiar with each agent's ''fist,'' the subtle variations in the way each person sent Morse code.</p>

        <p>Now that typing rhythms are being used as a way to validate passwords (''New Encryption Strategy: Typing Rhythm,'' June 29), we should remember that the idea of identifiable typing rhythms is even older than modern computing. According to ''The Codebreakers,'' by David Kahn (Scribner, 1996), the identities of members of the underground working behind Axis lines during World War II were validated by handlers who were familiar with each agent's ''fist,'' the subtle variations in the way each person sent Morse code.</p>
        <p>Of course, this was back before automatic code keys let people using Morse code send a regular pace of dots and dashes as the appropriate key was depressed. That device fought code fatigue but gave one's Morse code a mechanical sound. I suppose a similar device will be developed for those who become tired of repeatedly entering their digital signatures for validation.</p>
