        <p>Ron Low said yesterday that he is ''a firm believer in not looking at the past.'' And yet, many of the themes that ran through Low's introductory news conference as the 30th head coach in Rangers history hark back to the disaster of last season.</p>
        <p>Low stressed the need for an attitude change on a team that has failed to make the playoffs in each of the last three springs.</p>
        <p>''It's imperative that there is an adjustment,'' said Low, who will be welcoming back Mark Messier to the club today at a morning news conference. The team announced last night that it had reached agreement with the free-agent center, who reportedly got a two-year deal worth $8 million.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect it to be easy,'' Low said of his task ahead. ''But I also think the people that are here can get it done.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to his two new assistants, Ted Green and Walt Kyle. He was also referring to Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, who hired him. All four men worked together at Edmonton.</p>
        <p>Yesterday all four stressed the same themes -- familiarity, loyalty, the ability to communicate, being on the same page -- that were absent on the Rangers last season. Singling out the Rangers' work ethic, Low said: ''Obviously, it wasn't good last year. It couldn't have been good. There were too many underachievers.''</p>
        <p>Said Sather: ''Even the cabdrivers have told me that. I've stayed in a couple of different hotels and the bellmen have told me that.''</p>
        <p>Sather, who was not able to hire either Kevin Lowe or Craig MacTavish for the top job -- turned to another person with Oiler roots.</p>
        <p>''The thinking was that we wouldn't have to go through a honeymoon together,'' Sather said, explaining his selection of Low, who was Sather's head coach in Edmonton for four-plus seasons. ''We know each other.''</p>
        <p>That said, Sather laid down his first mandate since becoming team president and general manager on June 1.</p>
        <p>''It is not acceptable for this team not to make the playoffs,'' Sather said.</p>
        <p>Low was asked if that put pressure on him.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure it does,'' he said. ''This game comes with a lot of pressure.''</p>
        <p>Low was asked if he felt added pressure by having the reigning Stanley Cup champion Devils across the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely none,'' Low said, before referring to the Islanders. ''The team the other way is vastly improved, too.''</p>
        <p>Low said he would like the Rangers to play the up-tempo style that became synonymous with Edmonton. He also made a distinction between the Oilers and this Rangers team. The former was built on youth and speed. The latter is laden with older, skilled players.</p>
        <p>''That's not the same type of team,'' said Low, who was coach and general manager of the Houston Aeros of the International Hockey League last season.</p>
        <p>''I understand that totally. Can you play the same way? I think you can. But if you can't, I'm very comfortable with backing up. I trapped last year in Houston. We will look at the situation here and judge ourselves accordingly.''</p>
        <p>Low also promised not to judge the Rangers on last season's fiasco. ''I don't think all those guys they signed last year are over the hill or finished,'' Low said. ''There had to be problems last year. We have to find out what they were and solve them.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers are obviously hoping that Messier, the former captain who led the team to a Stanley Cup in 1994,  will be one of the solutions. The team has not been in the playoffs since his departure in 1997.</p>
        <p>''What Mark brings to the table is incredible leadership,'' Low said before the Messier agreement was announced. ''People rally around him. He'd be a great guy to coach.''</p>
        <p>Many around the league believe that Messier could be a strong influence on Pavel Brendl, Jamie Lundmark and Manny Malhotra. Sather was asked yesterday if there would be spots for the team's young players.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' he said. ''I'm trying to make some changes in the organization. With the set-up of this hockey team, some of those changes are going to take time. But the plan is to make some changes. We're not going to force-feed somebody on the team who's not ready. They're going to have to make the hockey club, just like all the veterans.''</p>
        <p>Low, who said he wanted to look at everyone, mentioned Mike York, the Rangers' top rookie last season, as someone he wants to see firsthand.</p>
        <p>''I know Brendl is an unbelievable goal scorer,'' Low said. ''It would be nice if he's ready, but I definitely wouldn't put any pressure on him. Lundmark definitely excites you, also. Malhotra, I don't know enough about. But I know one thing about him: he can skate, which likely puts him in my plans. I don't know exactly where he fits. But I like people who can skate.''</p>
        <p>Low is being reunited with Sather one year after leaving Edmonton in a contract dispute.</p>
        <p>''It might have been a little silly pride,'' Low said. ''The fact that I thought I deserved a raise after getting the team into the playoffs and then knocking off heavily favored opponents twice in a row. I didn't want to be the lowest-paid coach in the league anymore. So I left. And I put my family into a tenuous position there for a while. But now, I'm not regretting the decision at all.''</p>
        <p>He signed a deal believed to be for three years at about $700,000 a season. ''Obviously, I'm not coming in with a blindfold on,'' Low said. ''I may leave with a blindfold on. Just give me a smoke.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Rangers' president and general manager, GLEN SATHER, admitted having an interest in signing CLAUDE LEMIEUX, who will be 35 when the season starts. ''Will I give him a four-year deal?'' Sather asked. ''No.'' . . . RON LOW on THEO FLEURY, the Rangers' biggest disappointment last season: ''He definitely wasn't the player I'd seen out West the last eight or nine years. Whatever the problems were, we have to solve them.'' . . . DON MALONEY was promoted to vice president for player development to go with his title of assistant general manager.</p>
