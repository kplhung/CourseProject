        <p>In a move to help the American computer industry and keep up with the dizzying pace of technological change, the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to ease restrictions on exports of high-performance computers.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 86 to 11, the Senate agreed to shorten the Congressional review period for the exports of high-performance computers to 60 days from the currently required 180 days.</p>
        <p>The measure, an amendment to a defense-authorization bill, has already been approved by the House, and it is supported by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Under a 1998 law, American exporters of high-performance computers (those running at 2,000 million theoretical operations a second) have been subjected to a six-month review period with the aim of protecting technological secrets of the United States. Backers of the measure passed today contended that the provision no longer made sense because some products could become obsolete during the six-month period.</p>
        <p>''The current export-control system interferes with legitimate United States exports because it does not keep pace with the high rate of innovation in the microprocessor market,'' said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and a co-sponsor of the measure along with Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah.</p>
