        <p>Riders relax as Tour de France bicycle race takes day off before very difficult climbing stage (M)</p>

        <p>The Tour de France took a day off today and the riders relaxed, sleeping late, doing a little training, entertaining friends and families at their hotels. Whatever else the 160 men left in the race did, anybody who said he did not spend some time thinking about the giant of Provence, Mont Ventoux, was lying.</p>
        <p>Mont Ventoux, on the schedule Thursday, is a 21-kilometer (13-mile) climb past the tree line into a desolation of strewn rock. It can be obsessive to Tour riders. Many of them have suffered there, and one of them -- Tom Simpson, who suffered heat asphyxiation, complicated by amphetamine use, during a 1967 stage -- died there. Few have climbed the mountain with the joy they find in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>

        <p>The Tour de France took a day off today and the riders relaxed, sleeping late, doing a little training, entertaining friends and families at their hotels. Whatever else the 160 men left in the race did, anybody who said he did not spend some time thinking about the giant of Provence, Mont Ventoux, was lying.</p>
        <p>Mont Ventoux, on the schedule Thursday, is a 21-kilometer (13-mile) climb past the tree line into a desolation of strewn rock. It can be obsessive to Tour riders. Many of them have suffered there, and one of them -- Tom Simpson, who suffered heat asphyxiation, complicated by amphetamine use, during a 1967 stage -- died there. Few have climbed the mountain with the joy they find in the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
        <p>''The Ventoux is a god of Evil, to which sacrifices must be made,'' wrote Roland Barthes, the French philosopher, pioneer of semiotics, sometimes windbag and full-time bicycle racing fan. ''It never forgives weakness and extracts an unfair tribute of suffering.''</p>
        <p>Lance Armstrong, wearing the yellow jersey as the overall leader, may never have deconstructed Barthes's half-century-old essay about the Ventoux in the collection ''Mythologies,'' but he agrees with the sentiment.</p>
        <p>''It's just a weird place, a very weird place,'' he said recently, recalling his climb there in a race last month. ''It's the hardest climb in the Tour, bar none.</p>
        <p>''There's no life. Rocks. Any other climb there's vegetation, grass and trees. Not there on the Ventoux. It's more like the moon than a mountain.''</p>
        <p>Tyler Hamilton, an American teammate of Armstrong's with the United States Postal Service team,  won the Ventoux stage last month in their final preparatory race for the Tour.</p>
        <p>''It's a very difficult climb,'' he said. ''You need to have a lot of respect for it, a lot of respect.</p>
        <p>''The last six kilometers are very difficult. When I attacked there with about a kilometer to go, did the 100 percent effort, I was suffering.''</p>
        <p>Barthes would understand, and probably approve.</p>
