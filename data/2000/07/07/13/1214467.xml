        <p>WHEN the ribbon of scaffolding and razor coils went up around his building on 101st Street and Broadway a few months back, Paul Byard took it as a harmless inconvenience. As an architect, he'd been responsible for his share of those steel and plywood constructions over the years. The awning was an eyesore, but a temporary one. Then, walking down Broadway on a recent night, he approached yet another makeshift overhang, this one more isolated, an ad hoc darkened alley.</p>
        <p>''It was grungy, scary, not well lit,'' Mr. Byard, a partner in Platt Byard Dovell, recalled. ''And it was richly inhabited by people with social problems.'' He considered crossing the street but soldiered through, more annoyed than genuinely threatened. ''It's a nuisance,'' he said of the structures casting a shadow over an ever-greater part of the city grid. ''You have to walk in the street to get around it. It cuts off diagonals. And it makes it awkward to jaywalk.''</p>
        <p>It is becoming the signature profile for much of the city: not the grand Deco kitsch of the Chrysler building or the telltale green canvas of Starbucks creep, but the unlovely clump of plywood and metal tubing known in the trade as the sidewalk shed or bridge. The Buildings Department, which regulates the structures, issued 1,806 permits for sheds in the first six months of 2000, up roughly 80 percent from the same period just five years ago. Obstructing sightlines and walking paths, squeezing already congested sidewalks, the sheds have become pedestrians' analogue to squeegee guys, a minor obstacle replicated onto every street corner, at least when you're in a hurry.</p>
        <p>''They're out of hand,'' said Vanessa Gruen, director of special projects at the nonprofit Municipal Art Society, referring not just to the sheds but to the giant billboards screaming from many. ''I think they're terrible.''</p>
        <p>Some sheds come and go in a few months; others, erected around buildings caught up in litigation or other financial entanglements, can linger for years, without any sign of repair work above.</p>
        <p>So where, you might ask, is the outrage? New Yorkers, especially those who sit on co-op boards, can come to blows over carpet samples. Yet, they have been strangely accommodating on the scaffold question, accepting the civic intrusion as a twist of providence, like car alarms or private school tuition.</p>
        <p>''One gets used to it,'' said Michael Blackwood, a documentary filmmaker, who has for more than a year lived behind a dark steel mesh while workers restore the facade of his landmark 58th Street co-op. Mr. Blackwood described the disruption as necessary and minor. ''It's like being sick for a while,'' he added. ''You go through it, and then you get better.''</p>
        <p>The reasons for shed spread are mundane. Contractors like Sal Impieri, branch manager of Safway Steel Products in Brooklyn, credit the strong economy for a boom in construction and renovation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the city's infrastructure is showing the effects of a century of erosion and stress, developing unfortunate creeks and cracks that threaten the pedestrians below.</p>
        <p>There is no telling how many passers-by or billable hours have been saved by a timely shed. Mr. Impieri, who works the high end of the market, estimates that his business has grown 30 to 40 percent in each of the last two years, a rise he described as common in the industry.</p>
        <p>By his lights, the aesthetic impact of all that scaffolding is not to be underestimated. ''When you're in the business,'' he said, ''everything looks beautiful, whether I do it or someone else.''</p>
        <p>But the main reason for all the sheds may be bureaucratic. In 1998, after bricks fell from a Madison Avenue office building, the city passed a regulation known as Local Law 11, calling for inspection of all facades over six stories. The deadline for inspection was in March. Once up, sheds can linger, sometimes for several years. Landlords run out of money for repairs; contractors leave for more lucrative jobs.</p>
        <p>''It's just like dealing with contractors on my own house,'' said Gary Larson, executive vice president of the Scaffolding Industry Association, a trade group. ''I'm ready to shoot them.'' Scaffolding contractors set up the sheds, then take them away when all is finished: It is up to all the other parties to get the work done. Though scaffold permits last only a year, landlords can renew them by attesting that they have not done the repair work. As long as the shed keeps the sidewalk safe, the city doesn't penalize landlords for not finishing the work.</p>
        <p>On a recent stroll up the Avenue of the Americas toward Herald Square, Neel Scott emerged from the shadow of one rusty overhang like a swimmer coming up for air before diving under the next. Mr. Scott is a campaign coordinator for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for pedestrians and bicyclists; strictly speaking, this disarray is his metier. ''That's just what I'm talking about,'' he said, trying to squeeze upstream against a rush-hour tide heading down. The shed's support poles stood about two and a half feet from the building and one and a half feet from the curb, trimming the sidewalk by about four feet. Sidewalk vendors hawked cheap toys and gadgets underneath; a man oblivious to the crush slept under a ragged blanket in the shade.</p>
        <p>For Zoltan Lebovich, the building's superintendent, this scene was a vision of progress. ''Everyone likes it, they hide from the rain --  even the homeless,'' he said, adding that the shed would come down in four to six months, once the building was repointed.</p>
        <p>David Barone, standing in the shadow before his empty shop, was less enthusiastic about the obstruction and the community growing beneath it. ''People are missing the store,'' he complained, his awning obscured by the protective canopy. ''It hurts, but what are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>The answer, some architects contend, is prettier scaffolding. Michael Graves drew mostly positive responses to the aluminum and blue polyester sheath he erected around the Washington Monument, since removed in time for the Fourth of July festivities.</p>
        <p>Modeled after a 16th-century etching by the Roman architect Domenico Fontana, the construction was a cover-up Washington people could get behind; groups in Minneapolis and Richmond, Va., campaigned to move it to their towns for permanent display. Both projects fell through, but Mr. Graves sees the restoration as a possible lead to a new, decorative age of scaffolding. ''Think of the advertising opportunities, or the opportunities for younger artists,'' he said, speaking from a hotel phone in Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Graves considers New York's current scaffold glut an emblem of dynamism, not an aesthetic blight. ''My worry isn't about the scaffolding, but that what you see when it comes down is a disappointment,'' he said. ''You think maybe the scaffolding was better.''</p>
        <p>The British writer G. K. Chesterton proposed that ''there is something strangely primary and poetic about this sight of the scaffolding and main lines of a human building; it is a pity there is no scaffolding round a human baby.'' A warming thought, perhaps. But then, Chesterton never had to squeeze himself under a cramped Midtown awning at rush hour, or return home to find his apartment swaddled in steel tubes and marquee-size ads for a Web site.</p>
        <p>Which is to say, he did not live in New York City at the start of the 21st century, looking up for the stars and seeing instead the corrugated sheet metal of yet another sidewalk shed. If he had, he might have viewed scaffolding differently. Or he might have kept his head down and commented on it not at all.</p>
