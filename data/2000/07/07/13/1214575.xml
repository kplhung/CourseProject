        <p>The Russian authorities brought tax evasion charges against top executives at the country's biggest carmaker today as part of President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to loosen the grip of Russia's richest men on the country's most profitable enterprises.</p>
        <p>The executives of the carmaker, AvtoVAZ, were charged a day after the authorities filed suit against managers at Russia's biggest oil company, also on charges of tax evasion. Since May, the authorities have swept through offices of media and oil companies and have brought charges against some of them.</p>
        <p>The charges today may be a move against one of Russia's most influential men, Boris A. Berezovsky. A member of Parliament and a friend of former President Boris N. Yeltsin's family, Mr. Berezovsky used  his car dealership, LogoVAZ, to help create another company that owns a third of AvtoVAZ.</p>
        <p>In his election campaign this year, Mr. Putin vowed to limit the influence of Russia's oligarchs, the businessmen who amassed fortunes during the sale of prize assets over the last decade, and who at times have influenced government policy.</p>
        <p>''We have a saying about catching fish in muddy waters,'' Mr. Putin said in a television interview. ''There are fishermen here who have already caught a lot and want to keep the situation as it is for a long-term historical period. I don't think this is acceptable for the Russian people or for our partners abroad.''</p>
        <p>AvtoVAZ, a longtime tax deadbeat, handed the government a controlling stake last year in exchange for delaying the payment of about $100 million in tax bills. Today, the tax police accused the company of hiding sales by duplicating car serial numbers to avoid taxes. A company spokesman denied the charges.</p>
        <p>With a factory in southern Russia built by Fiat of Italy, AvtoVAZ produces about three-quarters of Russia's cars. The company has been in talks with General Motors on setting up a joint venture.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, top executives at Lukoil Holding, Russia's biggest oil company, were accused of tax evasion, while investigators demanded that Vladimir O. Potanin, who has vast holdings in Russian banks, metals and media companies, reimburse the state for losses incurred during a privatization in 1997.</p>
