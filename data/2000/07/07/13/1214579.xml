        <p>Buried deep in the rubble of an exploded, shattered town house in Brooklyn, there were small pockets of space, some barely large enough to crawl through. They gave a glimmer of hope early yesterday to Ray Downey and his men.</p>
        <p>As the person in charge of the New York Fire Department's rescue squads, Chief Downey thought it was possible that someone might be alive in one of those pockets. So through the night his teams gently burrowed into a shaky, shifting mound of bricks and beams and plaster. When they found a pocket, a man would gingerly crawl inside, or they would explore it with a camera mounted on the end of a pole.</p>
        <p>It was slow, dangerous work, but by late yesterday morning Chief Downey and several of his men had wormed their way inside a promising opening at the basement level. Probing ahead with a camera, they saw a sneaker.</p>
        <p>Chief Downey's heart sank.</p>
        <p>The sneaker was protruding from rubble packed so tightly that Chief Downey, a veteran of the Oklahoma City bombing rescue efforts, felt certain that no one could survive the weight. But to be sure of what they were looking at, one of his men used a pick to tear a small hole in the sock. They saw skin.</p>
        <p>At that moment, Chief Downey lost hope for Leonard and Harriet Walit and their neighbor, Khay Cochran, all three missing after a suspected gas explosion blew apart both the Walits's town house at 420 State Street and much of Mr. Cochran's town house at 418 State Street.</p>
        <p>''Now we start worrying about our guys,'' Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said.</p>
        <p>It had been a long night for the would-be rescuers.</p>
        <p>Within half an hour of the explosion at 7:45 p.m. Tuesday, 200 firefighters had arrived, and a total of 300 eventually came to the scene  during the night. But for all the manpower and technology, the clearing of the debris was painstaking. Firefighters relied on their hands for fear that a machine could accidentally injure any survivors or cause another collapse.</p>
        <p>The first firefighters to arrive came running from Engine 226 down the block, where they had been practicing drills when they heard the explosion. Deputy Chief Philip J. Burns said he smelled gas and radioed for help. Firefighters scanned the debris for survivors.</p>
        <p>They saw none, but forced their way into the rear of an adjacent red-brick town house that had also been heavily damaged. Two men were crawling up from the basement.</p>
        <p>The firefighters evacuated them and other residents from neighboring buildings while snaking hoses through those hallways, in case a fire broke out. Twenty minutes after the blast, and after asking the gas company, KeySpan Energy, to turn off the gas to the collapsed building, dozens of firefighters climbed atop the rubble and began loading up blue plastic buckets with debris. Those were passed out along a human chain.</p>
        <p>The entire time, fire chiefs nervously watched the walls of the two neighboring buildings. Would they collapse on the men atop the rubble? One fire truck extended its crane bucket up three stories next to one wall to deflect any collapsing bricks. Two men with tripod-mounted surveying instruments climbed onto ledges near the collapsed building to measure any hairline movement in the walls. At the first sign, they would give a signal to a man in Ladder 105, who would sound a horn.</p>
        <p>Some firefighters atop the rubble decided to make a go at the cellar. They had found a few precarious pockets of space, which the firefighters called voids. They were not ideal spaces, just big enough to squeeze three men inside. If they needed to support the rubble from below, they could ask for pieces of lumber.</p>
        <p>When Firefighter Robert Galione of Rescue 2 first squeezed into one of those voids on Tuesday night, he knew he was heading into a bad situation.</p>
        <p>Because of the magnitude of the destruction at 420 State Street, Mr. Galione and other firefighters first had to walk through three other row houses on the block to familiarize themselves with the typical layout of the buildings.</p>
        <p>He watched for falling bricks as he stepped into the opening. He poked at tattered bits of clothing to check for bodies. Above him, debris rained down from next door.</p>
        <p>''You do this so often you get desensitized to it,'' he said hours later. ''We're just doing our job.''</p>
        <p>As night stretched into dawn, Firefighter Galione and dozens of colleagues went into the void up to 25 times each, trusting their lives to blind luck and the vigilance of their peers above ground. ''We were very hesitant to go past a certain point,'' he said yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The firefighters began poking around with miniature cameras attached to metal rods and fiber-optic cables. These ran to small monitors atop the rubble. People scrutinized the screens, but saw only bricks, beams and darkness.</p>
        <p>Around 2 a.m. yesterday, the rescue workers decided to start excavating with a large yellow backhoe.  The backhoe scooped up debris in its metal jaws and dumped it in the middle of the street. Half a dozen firefighters searched through the piles with metal poles for anything worth salvaging. Neighbors piled the items into garbage bags: a wooden bead necklace, a Richard Strauss album, a copy of ''The Anti-Coronary Cookbook.''</p>
        <p>''They're the last remnants of their lives,'' said Kristen Austin, a neighbor, as she lifted up a piece of metal grillwork.</p>
        <p>That is how it went from night into morning: the firefighters using their hands, then the backhoe coming in for an hour or two, then the firefighters going back to their hands, in case there were survivors near the surface. If the dust got too thick, they sprayed the rubble down with the hoses. The Police Department brought three German Shepherd search dogs.</p>
        <p>Shortly before noon, one rescuer in a group that included Firefighter Galione poked at a sneaker buried in rubble in one of the voids.</p>
        <p>They soon cleared the debris and passed Mr. Walit's body up a chain of hands. A hush fell over the onlookers waiting above ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walit's wife and a neighbor were still down there -- although their bodies would not be found until several hours later.</p>
        <p>Firefighters immediately shifted to a more cautious mode of search. For 15 hours they had worked in the shadow of an unsupported brick wall that loomed over their excavation pit. Chief Downey had not dared to disturb the wall for fear of collapsing a pocket. But now they demolished the wall with a backhoe.</p>
        <p>Wood, brick and glass crashed to the ground in a thick cloud of dust. Down the street, Firefighter Galione stood in his T-shirt and calmly lighted a cigarette as the men of another fire engine put on their hard hats and black jackets to go back into the void.</p>
