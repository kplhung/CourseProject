      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Affluence is supposed to bring contentment: the satisfaction of basic physical needs, the resources to enjoy more refined pleasures. But in Dave Matthews's songs, affluence can't stave off a crisis that might as well be called spiritual. It leaves him confused, lonely, appalled at his own daily compromises and longing for release. Love would help; God might help, too. But he's not sure he can hold on to either one. At Giants Stadium here on Tuesday night, opening a three-night stand, Mr. Matthews sang, ''I can't believe that we would lie in our graves/Dreaming of things that we might have been.''</p>
        <p>His music, at first, seems too fragile and intricate for a stadium show. The songs revolve around Mr. Matthews strumming an acoustic guitar, singing in a voice that rarely finds peace; it broods somewhere between Eddie Vedder and Cat Stevens. There's no bombast in his band of saxophone, violin, bass, drums and keyboards. Most of the time, the music is a briskly syncopated latticework, riding the pinpoint accents that Carter Beauford taps across cymbals, wood blocks and drums.</p>

        <p>Affluence is supposed to bring contentment: the satisfaction of basic physical needs, the resources to enjoy more refined pleasures. But in Dave Matthews's songs, affluence can't stave off a crisis that might as well be called spiritual. It leaves him confused, lonely, appalled at his own daily compromises and longing for release. Love would help; God might help, too. But he's not sure he can hold on to either one. At Giants Stadium here on Tuesday night, opening a three-night stand, Mr. Matthews sang, ''I can't believe that we would lie in our graves/Dreaming of things that we might have been.''</p>
        <p>His music, at first, seems too fragile and intricate for a stadium show. The songs revolve around Mr. Matthews strumming an acoustic guitar, singing in a voice that rarely finds peace; it broods somewhere between Eddie Vedder and Cat Stevens. There's no bombast in his band of saxophone, violin, bass, drums and keyboards. Most of the time, the music is a briskly syncopated latticework, riding the pinpoint accents that Carter Beauford taps across cymbals, wood blocks and drums.</p>
        <p>Yet it's not as delicate as it might seem. Boyd Tinsley's violin pulls the songs toward Celtic folk melodies; LeRoi Moore's saxophone and flute solos tilt them toward jazz, and the whole band can mesh for sinewy funk riffs. The music reaches for hybrids, pulling in Fairport Convention, James Brown and Weather Report, slipping into odd meters and piling up prickly dissonances. And for all its ambitions, it creates a sleek momentum. Even when Mr. Matthews sings about being trapped or unsure, the music moves along, and plenty of fans are ready to dance to it.</p>
        <p>In the last few years Mr. Matthews has become a stadium regular, with thousands of voices singing along as he ponders reasons to live. In a two-and-a-half-hour set, the band progressed from thoughts of overconsumption and overwork in ''Too Much'' to questions about purpose in ''Lie in Our Graves,'' ''Typical Situation'' and a newer song, ''Bartender,'' in which Mr. Matthews prays that money and success not ruin him. Eventually, it found its way to lusty romance, ending with the jubilant ''Rapunzel.''</p>
        <p>The band's music is still evolving. Having perfected its own syncopated pointillism, it is testing richer, more sustained textures. ''Bartender,'' based on one long-held chord, pealed like a U2 song, and in another new song, ''Busted Stuff,'' Mr. Matthews and three female backup singers repeated the line ''You're the one for me'' again and again, a mantra of longing and obsession that became richly hypnotic. Remarkably, Mr. Matthews and his band can make a whole stadium look inward.</p>
        <p>Two opening acts shared the bill. Ben Harper and his band, the Innocent Criminals, are a paradoxical blend of diffidence and arena dynamics. Mr. Harper spent most of the set seated, playing a lap slide guitar and singing in a haunted, androgynous voice about idealistic goals and thwarted love. But from that guitar came muscular blues and boogie licks, climbing toward distorted peaks. The combination was like Led Zeppelin with politically correct self-consciousness instead of bravado.</p>
        <p>Ozomatli, from Los Angeles, is a polyglot party band. Its first song jumped from samba to merengue within four minutes, and in the course of its set it also touched on hip-hop, dance-hall reggae and Mexican cumbia, all played with gusto and nuance.</p>
        <p>After finishing its set onstage, Ozomatli paraded into the audience like a brass band, playing a mini-set that mixed samba propulsion with musical quotations from Metallica, Duke Ellington and the ''Looney Tunes'' theme. Ozomatli songs call for unity amid diversity, and its music lived up to that goal.</p>
