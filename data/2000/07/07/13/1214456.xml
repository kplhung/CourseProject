        <p>SCAPEGOAT  The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation  By Andrea Dworkin  436 pages. The Free Press. $28.</p>
        <p>During the course of her new book, ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation,'' Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a similar thirst to dominate the weak.</p>
        <p>She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example, asserting that the Israeli Army ''may be the only one in the world'' whose members routinely ''sexually expose themselves'' as ''a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of women.'' Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that, according to Ms. Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives. One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ''Orthodox Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of prostitutes.''</p>
        <p>It is statements like these -- and there are numerous others in Ms. Dworkin's new book -- that illustrate the intemperate, extremist and intellectually seedy side to a book that in other respects is a learned and thought-provoking etiology of hatred through history. You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control method.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt at verification. As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Ms. Dworkin would know that. She gives no source at all for this information, though her book is generally heavily footnoted.</p>
        <p>There are, in short, many problems with this passionate, overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument. Ms. Dworkin's main point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate. In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews. Or, as Ms. Dworkin puts it:</p>
        <p>''Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews in ghettos, women in houses. Because, like women, Jews have not fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women.''</p>
        <p>Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to that argument, which Ms. Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity. She writes with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely. Her new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which Ms. Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ''Every one of these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: which is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman the scapegoated victim.''</p>
        <p>Still, ''Scapegoat'' makes you think of one of those arcade games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance to see exactly who they are, and Ms. Dworkin sees many enemies. Her overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold ultimate political power: ''Women either are the state or women are resubordinated.''</p>
        <p>In this sense ''Scapegoat'' continues the themes already developed in past work by Ms. Dworkin, who has written many books on violence against women. Her comment about Orthodox men and prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ''Scapegoat'': Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them.</p>
        <p>''Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of way,'' she writes. And then: ''In male culture the nature of women is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but both justify eventual male violence.''</p>
        <p>But even if one shares Ms. Dworkin's natural horror at the prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced against women in some Muslim countries, ''Scapegoat'' remains untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism. Ms. Dworkin's book reads like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent an unspeakable whole.</p>
        <p>Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book to refute them all. Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613 of the religious commandments apply to men and only 2 to women, or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male culture leads her to range widely. For example, she cites the practice of suttee -- by which widows are burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands -- to represent pretty much the whole of the female condition in India. Nowhere does she tell us how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does make this rather remarkable declaration: ''In India, women can be murdered with impunity any time in life.'' No reasonable person would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Ms. Dworkin's unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination than assiduous research.</p>
        <p>The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven violence, transforms ''Scapegoat'' from scholarship to a kind of agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous explanation for the worst in human behavior.</p>
