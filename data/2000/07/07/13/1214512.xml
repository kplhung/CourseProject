        <p>The Supreme Court ruled today that the once-powerful leader of the strictly Orthodox Shas Party, Aryeh Deri, should be jailed for three years, upholding his conviction for bribery and fraud.</p>
        <p>After 10 years of investigations and litigation, the ruling dashed Mr. Deri's hopes of returning to the party leadership and disrupted what had been a meteoric career at the helm of the third largest party in Israel.</p>
        <p>''I accept the sentence with love and happiness,'' Mr. Deri, 41, said as he left court surrounded by weeping and shouting supporters. ''This is from heaven. Although the judges are flesh and blood and have free will, I believe that this is another test from God that has to be passed.''</p>
        <p>The case of Mr. Deri, for years a power broker whose support was vital for governments of the left and the right, has riveted Israelis and inflamed ethnic passions, exposing rifts between Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews as well as secular and Orthodox Israelis.</p>
        <p>The court scenes were broadcast live on television and replayed on radio, overshadowing reports from the talks at Camp David, Md.</p>
        <p>Ruling on an appeal by Mr. Deri, the court confirmed most of his conviction by a lower court last year for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. But it took a year off his four-year sentence, citing the time elapsed since the crimes were committed and the damage already inflicted on Mr. Deri's career. He will begin his term on Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deri had been convicted of accepting bribes from three associates in return for channeling large sums of public money to a yeshiva in the late 1980's, he was director general of the Interior Ministry and Interior Minister.</p>
        <p>He is now barred from being a cabinet minister for 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deri has been sidelined from active politics since he resigned as party chairman after the elections last year. Prime Minister Ehud Barak made Mr. Deri's departure a condition for adding Shas to his governing coalition, although Shas left the coalition this week to protest Mr. Barak's participation in the Camp David talks.</p>
        <p>Drawing on religious sentiment and ethnic resentment among working-class Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origins, Mr. Deri, who was born in Morocco, built Shas into a party able to make or break governments with its 17 seats in the 120-member parliament.</p>
        <p>Throughout his investigation and prosecution for corruption, Mr. Deri had portrayed himself as a victim of religious and ethnic persecution by secular Ashkenazic Jews of European origin, and he mined feelings of resentment to reap gains at the polls.</p>
        <p>After news of the court ruling filtered to his supporters, they denounced the sentence as another example of ethnic and antireligious oppression.</p>
        <p>''Not only are there trials against Jews in Iran, in the holy city of Jerusalem Jews are judged in show trials,'' Aryeh Gamliel, a legislator from Shas, said. ''Secular judges, elites. If he had blue eyes, he would have been acquitted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deri went from court directly to the house of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, his mentor and the spiritual leader of Shas. Rabbi Yosef declared that according to religious law Mr. Deri was innocent, and he pronounced the Supreme Court judges ''wicked,'' Israel Radio reported.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Deri will be politically crippled, it is far from clear that he will be permanently removed from political life. Commentators noted that his sentence could eventually be reduced by a third for good behavior and that he could be free in two years, ready for a comeback.</p>
