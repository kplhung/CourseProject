        <p>United States and Vietnam In a Sweeping Trade Accord  The United States and Vietnam have completed a sweeping trade agreement that would allow unfettered commerce between the two nations for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War more than a quarter-century ago, people involved in the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>A handful of large American companies have invested in Vietnam, and some analysts think they would immediately add thousands of jobs in Vietnam if American tariffs of Vietnamese-produced goods are substantially lowered. The agreement would also open Vietnam's market of 77 million people to a wide range of American companies. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>Not All Profiting From Oil Prices  Drivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline as they did a few years ago, but many operators of service stations and convenience stores, like Kenneth Cerny, who runs a market in Wisconsin, are poorer for it. The wholesale price of gas has risen faster than the price retailers can charge and still stay competitive, so rising gas prices have brought little benefit, and in some regions they have actually made it tougher to do business. For producers and refiners, however, higher gasoline and oil prices have meant sharply higher profits. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Mylan Settles Price-Fixing Case  Mylan Laboratories, one of the world's largest producers of generic drugs, tentatively agreed to pay $147 million to settle accusations that it improperly cornered the market on raw materials for two widely prescribed drugs and then raised the price of those drugs. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq Back in the Black for Year  Technology stocks surged, propelling the Nasdaq composite index into positive territory for the year. The Nasdaq rose 143.17 points, or 3.6 percent, to 4,099.59 The Dow Jones industrial average posted its fourth consecutive gain, rising 56.57 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,783.76. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 12.04 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,492.92. [C12.]</p>
        <p>Motorola Reports Strong Earnings  Motorola, the telecommunications and semiconductor giant, reported strong sales and profit growth for the second quarter, which were in line with Wall Street estimates, despite lingering weakness in the sales of its cellular telephones in Europe. [C23.]</p>
        <p>Global Crossing to Sell Local Unit  Global Crossing agreed to sell its local phone operations to Citizens Communications of Stamford, Conn., for $3.65 billion in cash, which Global will use to further its construction of a worldwide communications network. The deal transfers to Citizens about one million phone lines in Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and about 3,000 employees. Shares of Global Crossing rose $2.9375, to $32.0625, while Citizens rose 12.5 cents, to $18.8125. [C10.]</p>
        <p>Greenspan Offers Global Advice  In a speech, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a wide-ranging set of prescriptions for preventing and coping with global economic problems. [C13.]</p>
        <p>A Hutchison Wireless Venture  Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate, is teaming up with NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest wireless phone company, and Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator, to buy rights to offer next-generation mobile communication services in Europe. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Deal Reached for Connecticut Post  The company that owns The Connecticut Post, the state's second-largest daily newspaper, said that it would sell the paper and five community newspapers to MediaNews Group in Denver. Terms were not disclosed. [B5.]</p>
        <p>The Economic Cost of 'Ugly'  Across the country, conflicts are brewing over aesthetics, with more and more Americans demanding a world free of ''visual pollution'' like tacky porch furniture. This push to expand the definition of ''pollution'' forces us to re-examine why and how we regulate the spillovers that economists call externalities. Virginia Postrel: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
