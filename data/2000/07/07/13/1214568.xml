        <p>The specters tug at Al Groh, affixed to his sleeve as stubbornly as bubble gum on the bottom of a shoe. The three off-season losses suffered by the Jets loom larger than any free agent departure from any National Football League team as Groh tries to steady a franchise that endured a remarkably turbulent spring, lingering in the consciousness of a team that was defined in large part by the contributions of those three.</p>
        <p>''We've lost a legend, a genius and a star,'' Groh said, tongue firmly in cheek, on Tuesday. ''I don't know if we have a good chance. All I know is what I read.''</p>
        <p>The Jets have read little else but about the departures of the legend (their former coach, Bill Parcells), the genius (their former defensive guru, Bill Belichick, now the head coach at New England) and the star (receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was traded to Tampa Bay in the most stunning off-season move of all).</p>
        <p>Groh is clearly weary of the notion that everything he does this season will be viewed through a prism of what might have happened if Parcells had stayed on the sideline rather than moving into the Jets' front office as the director of football operations. He speaks glowingly of having a former head coach down the hall in Parcells to ward off the inevitable isolation of the top man. But Groh also makes clear that the team is already his.</p>
        <p>''In minicamp, there were occasions to hand down some fines,'' Groh said. ''There was only a six-letter signature.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Jets, who finished 8-8 last season, have undergone an overhaul as dramatic as any face lift. When the Jets begin two-a-day practices tomorrow in preparation for the regular season, which opens at Green Bay on Sept. 3, they will be met by a head coach who oversaw the linebackers last year, a receiving corps bereft of the Pro Bowler whose emotions made nearly as much impact as his hands, and, perhaps most profoundly, the yawning chasm left by the absence of the coach who, merely by showing up, returned respectability and competitiveness to the franchise.</p>
        <p>Last season began with the Jets wondering how far they could go. This one begins with everyone wondering who they are.</p>
        <p>''There is certainly a lot of change with the coaches and players,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who missed last season with a ruptured Achilles' tendon, said during minicamp in late May. ''We've got to continue to work at our goals and develop some unity.</p>
        <p>''We'll mix in the new players with the guys coming back. The good thing is Coach Parcells decided to stay. Just knowing he's in the building is a good thing.''</p>
        <p>But it is Groh on the field, and he is sanguine about the suggestion that one of his priorities as camp opens should be to establish his own way with the team. He has already been involved in some critical decisions.</p>
        <p>He approved the trade of Johnson and the selection of the draft picks, made the decision to have Dan Henning, the offensive coordinator, call the plays and held a mini-job fair for free-agent wide receivers. He has named Chad Pennington the quarterback of the future, thus relegating Ray Lucas to a one-year contract. And he has had to start planning for what seems to be the likely departure of linebacker Mo Lewis after this season.</p>
        <p>The issues that will be settled in training camp pale compared to the import of the actions of the off-season, but a few critical elements are still to be decided.</p>
        <p>The first-round picks, defensive end Shaun Ellis and linebacker John Abraham, are signed and ready to compete for playing time. They are the cornerstones of a buttressed pass rush, and their development will be one of the markers of how quickly the team progresses.</p>
        <p>Tight end Anthony Becht, another first-rounder, could press Fred Baxter for the starting job. The offensive line lost the veteran Jumbo Elliott to retirement and has tackle Jason Fabini moving from the right to the left side.</p>
        <p>The kick return teams are wide open since Leon Johnson has been cut, and Groh said that his top concern entering camp was determining who would return kicks.</p>
        <p>But Groh also knows that the question of who will be the starting free safety (Omar Stoutmire will have competition from Kevin Williams and Scott Frost) is not nearly as compelling as the highly anticipated public journey of self-discovery.</p>
        <p>''I'm not trying to follow anybody,'' Groh said. ''I'm not trying to emulate anybody. I'm surely not trying to precede anybody. You can get distracted by a lot of things. You have to realize that whatever others' sensitivities are to what's important to them, your job is to coach the team. We've had quite a break-in period here. I know a lot of these players personally. They will have to see me in a different light. The team doesn't need another linebacker coach.''</p>
