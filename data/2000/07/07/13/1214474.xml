        <p>Most people never even think about looking at the bar code on a book or CD they are about to buy. But new bar code software may cause some shoppers to hunt for those black-and-white symbols whenever they pick up a product.</p>
        <p>The software, which is designed to be downloaded to Web-enabled handheld devices like the Palm VII organizer, allows people to conduct online price comparisons the minute they spot a product on the shelf.</p>
        <p>By entering the 12-digit number that appears below the thin black lines of the bar code, a person sends a request for information over the wireless Internet. A few seconds later, several lines of information pop up on the screen, including data on the prices offered at other stores.</p>
        <p>Barpoint.com, a company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., developed the software, which can be downloaded from www.barpoint.com. Its databases include books, videos, music and software, and the company plans to add categories like consumer electronics, office supplies, toys, groceries, health and beauty products and automobile parts.</p>
        <p>With the comparison data in hand, said Jeffrey W. Sass, Barpoint.com's chief operating officer, shoppers will be able to decide, for example, whether a higher price in a store is worth the convenience of having the product in hand.</p>
        <p>The software cannot accept credit-card information, which would allow people to order immediately from Web sites or purchase items without walking through the check-out line. But eventually, Mr. Sass said, ''you'll even be able to shop from the wireless device.''</p>
