        <p>From his first days in office, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani worked to build a reputation for fiscal restraint, prescribing for the city a sober regimen necessary to eliminate the excesses he said he inherited.</p>
        <p>He championed deep cuts in social agencies and in other services as he reshaped city government in subtle and stark ways. Litter baskets overflowed, public libraries bought fewer books and the city work force was reduced by about 20,000.</p>
        <p>Through other efforts, the mayor claimed credit for a severe decline in crime, the revival of long-struggling city neighborhoods, and the improvement of standards and expectations within the nation's largest school system. Those goals remain the same. The emphasis on frugality, though, has eased.</p>
        <p>In contrast with the early restraint, as the city economy has flourished, government spending has accelerated over the last three years, growing at more than twice the rate of inflation, according to budget monitors. Many of the early cuts -- in the libraries, museums and other areas -- have been reversed. And spending is expected to jump by more than 7 percent in this fiscal year, the mayor's last full budget year, according to the monitors, although Mr. Giuliani considers this analysis inaccurate. The overall city work force, meanwhile, has surged again, and is expected to reach 255,443, the highest it has been in at least 25 years.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration is proud of its fiscal management. Officials say that the mayor has improved the city's financial shape and maintained control over spending, while also taking advantage of climbing revenues to enhance services in selected areas, like the police and the schools. The mayor called the current 2001 budget, which began July 1, ''an investment in the city's fiscal health that will benefit all New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>But the spending shift has caught the notice of budget monitors, who are asking why, in such good economic times, the Giuliani administration is projecting a $2.64 billion budget deficit for the 2002 fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''Things have looked so good people have not really paid a lot of attention to the trend that is developing,'' said State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat and frequent critic of the mayor's whose office has been responsible for monitoring city finances since the fiscal crisis 25 years ago. ''But I find it very troubling. It does represent a complete reversal of the kind of prudent management that you saw in the beginning.''</p>
        <p>Charles Brecher, research director at the private Citizens Budget Commission, which has had frequent conflicts with the mayor, said, ''It turns out the Giuliani administration has not been very strong to resist the temptation to spend when money is in the treasury.''</p>
        <p>What is happening in New York City, where overall government spending has increased by about $4.7 billion since 1997, is far from an anomaly. Across the United States, city governments are loosening their belts, taking advantage of the wave of new revenues generated by the booming economy. In fact, New York City's overall spending has grown at a slower rate than the average of the nation's top 10 cities during Mr. Giuliani's six years in office.</p>
        <p>The questions about Mr. Giuliani's fiscal habits are, at least in part, tied up in politics: Mr. McCall is contemplating a bid for governor, and another critic, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, is among the list of possible Democratic candidates for mayor. A slowing or a downturn in the economy could leave the next mayor in a situation not unlike the one Mr. Giuliani encountered when he arrived in office.</p>
        <p>And the criticisms of Mr. Giuliani as profligate are intensifying pressure on him as he negotiates with the city's labor unions because the settlement terms could drive up city costs into his successor's term.</p>
        <p>Giuliani officials do not dispute that spending has gone up in recent years. But the increases are at a lower rate than under Mr. Giuliani's predecessors, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, said Adam L. Barsky, director of Mr. Giuliani's Office of Management and Budget. Increases in state and federal money have, in part, fueled the growth in spending and the work force.</p>
        <p>''There was never a conscious effort to say, 'Oh, we can afford to now spend more money,' '' Mr. Barsky said, noting that the number of employees under the mayor's direct control is still lower today than when Mr. Giuliani came in. ''The approach has been, let's spend efficiently, let's spend smart, let's cut taxes and let's do all the things necessary to make sure the city is in good fiscal shape.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey L. Sommer, acting executive director of the New York State Financial Control Board, agreed. While the city still projects a budget deficit for next year, he pointed to the the administration's record of handling such challenges. And the areas where spending has grown, by and large, have been smart investments, he said. ''It has been a manageable increase,'' Mr. Sommer said. ''The city had needs it wanted to address.''</p>
        <p>The shrinking and later expansion of the city government have not occurred at random. Staff cuts in city social service agencies, for the most part, have not been restored. But dollars dedicated to the school system and the Police Department have climbed. As a result, 53 percent of the overall city work force today is made up of police officers or school employees, up from 46 percent in 1993.</p>
        <p>There is literally concrete evidence of a freer-spending government in recent years. The city has committed to borrowing more money for new construction in 2001 than at any other time in at least 25 years. The hundreds of new projects include schools, bridges and minor league ballparks.</p>
        <p>Some bond rating agencies, like Standard &amp; Poor's, have expressed concern about the amount of money the city is borrowing to pay for these new construction projects, like $300 million for a new courthouse on Jay Street in Brooklyn. They say that if the economy falters, the heavy debt burden will leave the city with little choice but to either make substantial cuts in its programs to balance the budget, or increase taxes.</p>
        <p>The mayor, his critics and other budget monitors calculate expenses in different ways, often with conflicting results. Most budget analyses focus on programs that are financed by city taxpayers, given that the mayor and City Council have little control over federal and state grants. For the 2001 fiscal year, the city-financed budget is $25.47 billion out of the $37.61 billion total. On the face of it, these figures suggest that the city's spending for the new fiscal year is down 3 percent from last year, a conclusion reached by the mayor's analysis.</p>
        <p>But budget monitors say the city's calculations distort year-to-year spending changes because the administration spends most of its end-of-the-year surpluses to prepay bills for the next fiscal year. After taking this and other factors into account, the budget adopted in June by the City Council and signed by the mayor raises spending by about $2 billion, an amount the budget monitors say means an increase -- not a decrease -- of at least 7.4 percent. According to either model, spending has grown more rapidly in the last three years.</p>
        <p>School enrollment grew about 3 percent during that time, reaching 1.1 million students. But city-taxpayer-financed spending grew by $1.44 billion, or 13 percent a year, according to the state comptroller's analysis. With this extra money, the teaching staff has swelled to a record high of more than 78,000, up by more than 9,125 in three years. Class sizes in lower grades are declining. Summer school has been expanded. Spending on teacher training, supplies and computers is up.</p>
        <p>The Police Department, meanwhile, has added 3,484 officers since June 1996; the force now numbers 40,212 officers, also a record high. The extra staff, hired in part with the assistance of federal grants, has allowed the department to expand special units, like narcotics squads, domestic violence teams and a new gang investigation division. City taxpayers spent $2.86 billion on the Police Department in the 2000 fiscal year, an increase of $637 million compared with 1997's budget.</p>
        <p>Spending has been cut deeply in some corners. The reduction in the welfare caseloads by about 583,900 people in the last five years is saving the city about $435 million just in this fiscal year. Spending on programs to preserve and build new housing -- most of it for lower- and moderate-income families -- has been cut from $161 million in 1993 to $60 million this year. Full-time social services employees overall have decreased by 7,047 since the mayor arrived, although in part this drop is a reflection of more reliance on private contractors for homeless shelters and other services.</p>
        <p>Without these cuts, city spending increases would be even greater. The hiring of part-time workers, increases in overtime payments for police officers and others, raises for city workers and rising health care costs, among other factors, have all pushed the city budget upward in the last several years.</p>
        <p>The New York City economy has been growing faster than the national average, and with this surge has come a bounty of new tax revenues. The revenue increases have been so great that overall city receipts have been going up, even as the mayor, the City Council and the State Legislature have approved tax cuts over the last five years cumulatively worth about $2.34 billion in 2000.</p>
        <p>At the same time, end-of-the-year surpluses have been growing, setting a fourth record in a row; the city wrapped up this last fiscal year with an estimated $3.2 billion in extra money. To the Giuliani administration and City Council leaders, this combination -- focused spending increases, tax cuts and surplus-laden budget years -- proves they are prudent fiscal stewards. And they attribute much of the work force expansion these days to increases in state and federal financing, city officials said.</p>
        <p>''If we end up with more revenue, what are we going to do with it? You have to spend it,'' said City Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Council Finance Committee. ''But we have taken the steps necessary to maintain the city's fiscal stability.''</p>
        <p>The trouble, fiscal monitors say, is that the city has come to rely on the huge budget surpluses to balance the budget. This year, for example, 72 percent of the $3.2 billion surplus from 2000 is dedicated to balance the 2001 budget.</p>
        <p>But, they note, an economic slowdown or even a smaller surplus would pose risks that would intensify given that the city has grown increasingly reliant on Wall Street for revenues. Those who work in the city's financial industry now pay nearly one-fourth of all income taxes, up from more than 14 percent about seven years ago. Their contribution underscores the gains of Wall Street: they fill fewer than 5 percent of the jobs in New York City.</p>
        <p>Some monitors are also troubled by the increase in city borrowing required to pay off the expansive  new construction projects. The annual debt service payments are projected to increase from $3.5 billion in 2000 to $4.7 billion in 2004, according to the state comptroller's count. Paying off the city's debt will then account for one of every five available city dollars, making it harder to cut spending, if necessary, because the city is required by law to pay off its debt.</p>
        <p>The fiscal monitors cite other causes of concern. The recent approval by legislators in Albany of automatic cost-of-living pension increases for retired city workers is  expected to cost the city an extra $236 million in 2002. A contract settlement with most of the city's unions could cost $425 million more than is budgeted for 2003, if salaries increase at just the rate of inflation.</p>
        <p>Finally, they note, the city decided to add $800 million to its recent operational budgets, using money generated by the city pension funds during the Wall Street boom that exceeded  pension obligations. The monitors felt the city should have either left the extra money in the pension funds, in case of an economic slowdown, or used it to reduce the city's debt.</p>
        <p>Instead, the city could face a budget gap for 2002 as high as $3.3 billion, according to a coming report by the city comptroller.</p>
        <p>''If you anticipate the revenue growth will continue in the next 10 years as it has in the last four, then you can dismiss the existence of out-year deficits,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''But it would be foolish to predict that given there are already signs the economy is slowing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sommer of the Financial Control Board predicted that the deficit projections would probably shrink, given that the Giuliani administration has been conservative in its revenue estimates. Mr. Barsky, the mayor's budget director, said he was already taking steps to reduce the spending gap, which he said was partly the State Legislature's fault.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, what the budget monitors hope to see in the coming months is the mayor's return to an emphasis on shaving unnecessary costs, perhaps by challenging city unions to increase productivity or face replacement by private-sector contractors or by putting more civilians into jobs now held by police officers.</p>
        <p>''The more you can do to boost productivity, the more you are able to sustain city services when times get rougher,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, chief economist and deputy director at the New York City Independent Budget Office. ''You don't want to wait until your back is against the wall.''</p>
