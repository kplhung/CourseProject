        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno and other top Justice Department officials assured the Rev. Jesse Jackson at a 90-minute meeting in Washington today that the department was actively investigating the hanging of a black youth in his front yard in Mississippi  a month ago.</p>
        <p>An autopsy concluded that the death of the youth, Raynard Johnson, 17, was suicide. But his family and Mr. Jackson say they are convinced that he was lynched because of his relationships with white girls.</p>

        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno and other top Justice Department officials assured the Rev. Jesse Jackson at a 90-minute meeting in Washington today that the department was actively investigating the hanging of a black youth in his front yard in Mississippi  a month ago.</p>
        <p>An autopsy concluded that the death of the youth, Raynard Johnson, 17, was suicide. But his family and Mr. Jackson say they are convinced that he was lynched because of his relationships with white girls.</p>
        <p>Under persistent pressure from Mr. Jackson, state, local and federal officials have been investigating the death for nearly four weeks despite a state medical examiner's finding of suicide. The autopsy found no cuts, scratches, bruises, wounds or other signs that Mr. Johnson had been either hanged by assailants or killed first and then strung up from the pecan tree where his body was found, in the small southern Mississippi town of Kokomo on June 16.</p>
        <p>J. Brad Pigott, the United States attorney in Jackson, Miss., said today that investigators had interviewed more than 40 people. ''We're determined to keep interviewing people in an attempt to get to the bottom of the true facts of the hanging,'' Mr. Pigott said. ''To the extent that any investigation can get to those facts, we are determined to do so.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pigott would not comment on the direction of the investigation. But Lisa S. Mader, director of communications for Mississippi's governor,  Ronnie Musgrove, said the state's public safety commissioner told the governor recently that ''all indications are still pointing to a suicide.'' Ms. Mader emphasized that the investigation was continuing.</p>
        <p>Among the evidence gathered by investigators, law enforcement officials say, is a statement from a friend of Mr. Johnson, a teenage girl who says she rebuffed a romantic overture by him in his bedroom less than two hours before he died.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement, Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. characterized the session today with Mr. Jackson, and with Mr. Johnson's mother and brother, as ''an informative meeting about a very tragic incident.'' He said he had explained that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies were ''actively investigating'' the death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said it was ''a step in the right direction'' that the Justice Department ''has kept an open mind.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Jackson and the Johnson family have raised many questions about the hanging, they have yet to present publicly any evidence that it was a homicide. But that has not kept Mr. Jackson from describing it as a lynching, or from repeatedly comparing it to the murder of Emmett Till, a black teenager killed in Mississippi in 1955, apparently after whistling at a white woman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson and Mr. Johnson's family say they are convinced that he did not commit suicide, because, they say, he was a carefree, optimistic young man who did well in school, made friends easily, recently bought a computer and was planning to attend college. Members of his family have said they do not believe that the brown, braided belt used in the hanging was his, and have raised questions about mysterious cars and barking dogs in their neighborhood on the two nights before the hanging.</p>
