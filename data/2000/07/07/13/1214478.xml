        <p>ON this remote South Pacific island, the students at Pago Pago Elementary School put on a show each year of traditional songs and dances to raise money for school improvements.</p>
        <p>One year, with the money that parents and relatives stuffed into the students' costumes as they sang and danced, the school bought a portable public address system. This year's goal, the school principal, Evelyn Bowles-Weilenman, said, is a new drinking fountain.</p>
        <p>But there is an addition to the school's resources that the parents have not had to help pay for -- 25 computers, housed in one of the few air-conditioned rooms on the run-down campus on the main island of Tutuila. The computers are hooked by satellite to a high-speed line in Hawaii. This on an island where it can take up to six months to get a phone line installed.</p>
        <p>The project was financed with nearly $4 million in grants from the E-rate program of the United States government. It connects every public and private school and library on this group of islands, providing an example of the way the program has brought a small and remote educational system into the Internet age.</p>
        <p>From Pago Pago to major cities in the continental United States to Aniak, Alaska -- a town accessible only by air -- the Clinton administration is pushing to meet its goal of connecting every classroom to the Internet. As the program enters its third year, nearly $4 billion has been given to schools and libraries in the United States and territories like Puerto Rico and Samoa.</p>
        <p>At the end of last year, 95 percent of the nation's public schools had at least one site with Internet access, and 63 percent of all classrooms had been wired, according to the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the program.</p>
        <p>The E-rate was nearly defeated by Republican lawmakers, who called it the ''Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore had championed the program, which imposed a fee on long-distance telephone companies. The issue had threatened to dog Mr. Gore in the presidential campaign, but the political firestorm has largely been extinguished. Now Mr. Gore touts the success of the E-rate as he campaigns, and Texas, the state of his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, has put together a $1.5 billion Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund to spread Internet access to schools and libraries.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to attack success,'' said William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
        <p>While the political rhetoric has slowed, there are still questions from educators and research groups about the value of having computers in every classroom.</p>
        <p>Still, for teachers and students in far-flung places like American Samoa -- a small group of islands just south of the equator with a population of about 65,000, about half way between Hawaii and Australia -- the program has been a lifeline of sorts.</p>
        <p>There are now 1,000 Internet-connected computers in the 46 schools and one public library in American Samoa, all bought with E-rate funds and other federal grants. Two years ago, there were only 89 computers in the schools, said Russ Aab, grants coordinator and technology supervisor for the territory's Department of Education.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, Mr. Aab said, 500 more computers will be added, meaning each of the territory's 900 classrooms will have a computer with Internet access.</p>
        <p>''In terms of curriculum, it has brought it to life,'' Ms. Bowles-Weilenman said. ''Pago elementary has participated in a number of video teleconferences. We are currently working with other schools to develop problems which will be solved by schools in various parts of the world to learn how similar problems are solved depending on geographic region.''</p>
        <p>The Internet has also provided a wealth of information for the schools, which have few traditional library resources. Tiffany Southworth, an eighth grader at Pago Pago Elementary, said her class used the Internet to learn about protecting the ocean. ''We talked to researchers, and we got to ask questions about the ocean,'' Tiffany said, ''how to protect the ocean and save the animals and plants.''</p>
        <p>The school also has a ukulele band that performs for schools in the United States via the Internet as part of their social studies projects.</p>
        <p>Perhaps just as important as the doors the Internet has opened for students are the opportunities it offers teachers, many of whom are not certified. With the reliable high-speed line, they can more easily participate in online continuing education programs through universities in Hawaii and California.</p>
        <p>At Taputapu elementary in a remote spot on the island of Tutuila, the principal, Donna Gurr, said children often stay after school to use the computers to communicate with friends and relatives in the States. And sometimes they bring in their parents, few of whom have computers at home.</p>
        <p>Before the high-speed line was connected, she said, the school had only one computer. And because of the island's poor phone service, connections were difficult.</p>
        <p>Still, for all the benefits the program has brought, the principals and teachers face the same challenges as educators around the United States who are trying to incorporate technology into their curriculum.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bowles-Weilenman this spring lost her computer laboratory teacher to the island's new library. And Ms. Gurr's computer teacher left for a job at the Department of Education.</p>
        <p>''To date, there is no curriculum or lesson plan teachers can follow,'' Ms. Bowles-Weilenman said. ''This to me is our greatest weakness. Often times, computer instructors rely on games, though educational ones, which rely solely on students' interaction, not creativity or production.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Bowles-Weilenman -- who is the daughter of one of the first teachers on the island who participated in another federally financed experiment, bringing certified teachers to village schools via television -- said she and others are working to overcome that problem.</p>
        <p>She has conducted several Internet workshops for principals and teachers on the island, she said. And she and a group of teachers are developing lesson plans that can be used at various grade levels.</p>
        <p>How to incorporate technology into schools could become the spinoff political battle. President Clinton recently announced $128 million in grants to help train teachers on computers. House Republicans, however, have opposed the proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard, meanwhile, said the program is ''the most revolutionary thing to happen to education in my lifetime.''</p>
        <p>When he is traveling, he said, he likes to visit schools that are benefiting from the program. On one visit, to a poor school district in Newark, he recalled sitting with a 9-year-old boy named John who had never used a computer before.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard said he showed John how to get on the Internet, then took him to the commission's Web site. ''I said, 'What do you think of this?' '' Mr. Kennard recalled. ''He said, 'It's boring.' So I took him to some Martin Luther King sites and started surfing around.</p>
        <p>''His face just lit up. He said: 'It's so cool. It's so fast. It's so much better than books.' ''</p>
