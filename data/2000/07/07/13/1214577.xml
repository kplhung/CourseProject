        <p>Vickie Johnson scored 19 points for the Liberty last night, leading her team to its fourth straight victory, an uneven 84-70 triumph over the hapless but gritty Charlotte Sting. Becky Hammon added 16 points, hitting four 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>But they were, by far, the least celebrated Liberty players.</p>
        <p>The Madison Square Garden fans, an announced crowd of 14,073, had been chanting for Olga Firsova, New York's sweet-smiling and little-used 6-foot-6-inch first-round draft pick from Ukraine. With 2 minutes and 28 seconds remaining and New York ahead, 80-63, the crowd squealed when Firsova stepped on the court.</p>
        <p>The fans roared, to her delight, when she hit a 12-foot jumper, and then when she took four steps on a slow-motion European layup and was called for traveling. They cheered loudest, though, when she lumbered coast to coast to the basket and drew a foul. Her teammates hugged Firsova as if she had won the game on a last-second shot. Instead, she had 3 points, giving her 7 on the season, and pulled down her first two rebounds of the year.</p>
        <p>''It was amazing when the fans started chanting for me,'' Firsova said. ''It's great, kind of cool.''</p>
        <p>''Maybe I should have put her in at the second half; that would have quieted the fans,'' Liberty Coach Richie Adubato joked. ''Obviously, Olga's a fan favorite.''</p>
        <p>On a night when the newly named All-Star Tari Phillips scored just 9 points, New York could afford to laugh and relax and not be bothered by the slow maturation of its first-round draft pick. For now.</p>
        <p>The puff-pastry portion of the Women's National Basketball Association schedule ended for the Liberty. After winning its last four games against teams with losing records, New York travels tomorrow to play Orlando, the top team in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>As quickly as the Sting (3-17) is disappearing into the depths of the W.N.B.A., losing its fourth straight, the Liberty (11-9) is charging ahead in the opposite direction. New York is a half-game behind Cleveland for second place and two games away from Orlando. New York's three-game road trip ends at Los Angeles, a team that has lost as many games as Charlotte has won this year. Three days later, New York comes home to play host to the three-time champion Houston Comets.</p>
        <p>''It's going to get tough from here,'' Adubato said.</p>
        <p>Charlotte did not give the Liberty much of a workout in the first half. The Liberty was stuck on 8 points for six minutes in the first half, but went on a 22-7 run, widening its lead to 18 points at halftime. Charlotte shot 17 percent and scored just 20 points.</p>
        <p>Johnson scored 5 of the Liberty's first 8 points in the second half, sparking a 14-point unanswered run, which Hammon capped with a 3-pointer. Just five minutes into the second half, New York led by 32 points.</p>
        <p>But point guard Teresa Weatherspoon had bruised her knee two minutes before, falling on the court, and the Sting took advantage, overwhelming the Liberty on the fast break and inching back to as close as 14 points with five minutes and then 1:41 to play.</p>
        <p>''I thought Vickie Johnson hit some big shots, especially when they made a run at us,'' Adubato said. But even though Andrea Stinson scored a game-high 21 points, Charlotte could not match New York's depth and speed, all the way to Firsova.</p>
        <p>''This is a team that definitely has its eyes on going to the championship,'' forward Sue Wicks said of the Liberty. ''Rarely does a rookie like Olga get to play when you have veterans like we do.''</p>
