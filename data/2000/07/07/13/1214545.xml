        <p>The Pataki administration yesterday criticized a proposal by Hillary Rodham Clinton to increase the amount of money New York receives from Washington for Medicaid expenditures, charging that she is far too late in addressing an issue state leaders have complained about for years.</p>
        <p>Her proposal, of which she has offered few details, would require the federal government to foot a larger part of the state's total annual Medicaid bill. Under her formula, New Yorkers' taxes could be cut by an estimated average of $400 a year through $3 billion in new funds.</p>
        <p>What annoys officials in the Pataki administration is not the proposal itself, which they fully embrace, but its timing. New York's elected officials have gone after federal increases for years. And a proposal to increase the state's percentage of money from the federal government was part of a bill vetoed by President Clinton in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Hillary Rodham Clinton is using this issue for her own political benefit, just like her husband,'' said John Signor, a spokesman for the State Health Department. ''This administration has been fighting for this change for years and the Clintons have not said boo about it since that veto. This is a credibility issue.''</p>
        <p>The criticism was echoed by the campaign staff of Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the New York race for the Senate.</p>
        <p>''We think this is a recycled broken promise,'' said Michael Marr, Mr. Lazio's spokesman. ''Mrs. Clinton has been in a position of influence for seven and a half years and never spoke out on this issue. Now she is having a deathbed conversion for the need to convert this formula.''</p>
        <p>Under the current formula, the state and the city generally split 50 percent of all Medicaid costs, with the Federal government picking up the other half. This calculation has long bothered members of both parties in New York, who feel the state shoulders too much of the burden and that its costs are greater than that of other states.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose seat Mrs. Clinton desires, has made many proposals over the years to change the formula in New York's favor. Mrs. Clinton, whose plan involves the federal government's  picking up a 56 percent share of the state's total costs, said this week that an expected increase in the federal budget surplus would make her plan more viable than in previous years.</p>
        <p>Pataki officials say their attack on Mrs. Clinton's plan has nothing to do with the governor's support for Mr. Lazio, and that their ire is molded by policy rather than politics. ''This has been an issue for us for the last five years,'' said Robert Hinckley, the state's deputy commissioner for operations.</p>
        <p>''We have a large urban poor population and our taxpayers are footing the bill for other states.'' In an example, he cited Arkansas as a state that receives 72 cents on the dollar from Washington for its Medicaid expenditures. ''This is an issue for us every single year,'' Mr. Hinckley said.</p>
        <p>Had Mrs. Clinton suggested that the current spending formula be left as is, the Pataki administration would have been equally unhappy, he conceded. ''We would have been opposed to that too,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's staff disputed the assertion that the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which President Clinton vetoed, would have allocated more federal Medicaid money for New York. Further, her staff questioned why the state was bringing up the issue at all. ''It sounds like a political attack and they don't have their facts straight,'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman.</p>
        <p>And he questioned the State Health Department's motives in releasing a criticism of Mrs. Clinton's plan. ''I can't imagine that this has anything to do with Governor Pataki's support for Rick Lazio, because that would be a misuse of government resources on behalf of a political campaign,'' Mr. Wolfson said.</p>
        <p>In a fashion, both camps' accounts are factual. While a complicated formula under the 1995 bill would have increased some money for New York, it also set a cap on how much money each state would get each year. That amount would have risen at roughly the rate of inflation, even though Medicaid spending was outpacing that by a great deal. So in effect, New York would have ended up footing a larger percentage of each year's Medicaid bill.</p>
        <p>Further, the overall Medicaid budget, as well as that for Medicare,  was reduced under the bill, in cuts the president cited when he vetoed it. New York's hospitals and health care workers strongly opposed the bill as well.</p>
        <p>''We very much wanted it to be vetoed,'' said David Rich, a senior vice president at the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''There was a lot in it not to like.''</p>
