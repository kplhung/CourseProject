        <p>At the edge of the crowd of mourners, a visiting chorus of Bible-quoting protesters began sounding off behind a police cordon, proclaiming that the victim of a grisly fatal beating last week, a young gay black man, had been dispatched to hell.</p>
        <p>''Homosexuality is an enormous sin -- read Leviticus 21:8,'' proclaimed one of the less vulgar signs bobbing at the fringe of the crowd.</p>
        <p>David Strickler, a husky, 48-year-old local resident who is gay, knew what he had to do. He strapped on an oversized pair of theater-prop wings and used them to block the protesters' view of an otherwise peaceful evening memorial in this city of about 20,000 people 115 miles northeast of Charleston, the state capital. ''They say they're coming in the name of God, but they're coming in the name of hatred,'' he said quietly above the protesters' din.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strickler played the protective angel, an antiheckler role being seen increasingly at gay rights gatherings. He helped reduce the small band of antigay visitors to a minor nuisance on an extraordinary night in this rural county seat, where hundreds of gays and lesbians, blacks and whites, stood together in the streets and demanded justice in behalf of Arthur Warren Jr., whose beaten body was found last week on a back road near Paw Paw Creek.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warren, 26, was openly gay. His mourners, while conceding the difficulty of plumbing the nature of hatred and homicide, demanded a full investigation and disputed official insistence that neither racism nor homophobia had been a motive.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Warren was taken for a hit-and-run victim. But then a conscience-stricken 16-year-old boy, who has not been charged in the crime, went to the authorities. Two unidentified white teenagers, both 17, were arrested and charged with the killing; the authorities said the teenagers beat and kicked Mr. Warren to death and then drove a car over his body in an effort to mask the crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warren's battered corpse drew sobs and shrieks at his open coffin on Saturday as local mourners demanded more information. Many were incredulous when the police insisted that hatred of gays and blacks was not a motive in the slaying.</p>
        <p>Friends said Mr. Warren was a gentle person and a church volunteer who had a summer park job and other occasional employment. The friends said Mr. Warren sometimes told of earlier incidents of harassment for both racial and sexual bias.</p>
        <p>''There is no indication of a hate crime,'' Sheriff Ron Watkins of Marion County said in a radio interview when asked about the reported confessions of the defendants. ''There was no indication anyone hated a particular group, especially gays.''</p>
        <p>The sheriff offered no elaboration, saying the two teenagers were subject to closed juvenile proceedings until the court decided within the next month whether they should be tried as adults.</p>
        <p>As people active in the human rights movement congregated here from around the country, members of the Tuesday night memorial crowd of about 400 insisted that hatred had to be at the heart of the killing, whether it was racism, homophobia or a combination of both. In any case, they heard speakers complain that there were shortcomings in existing hate-crime laws.</p>
        <p>West Virginia law, like federal law, covers race but not sexual orientation under the hate-crime statute. A bill to remedy this passed the State Senate but died in the House of Delegates earlier this year. In Washington, a proposal pending in the Senate would include sexual orientation under the hate-crime law and enable federal prosecutors to step in when local officials do not act.</p>
        <p>''We're dying from the inside out in this country because of hatred,'' said Mr. Strickler, a social worker, his papier-mache wings stretched upward from the memorial outside the county courthouse. ''We want this to be treated as a hate crime.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Strickler, like many in the crowd, argued that a clear law against bias crimes would not be redundant in this first-degree murder case, and that it would be an object lesson against hateful practices that can and do turn deadly.</p>
        <p>''We want answers!'' boomed one speaker, drawing applause.</p>
        <p>Another, David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian watchdog group, told the crowd, ''There is no doubt in our minds that hate was a factor in this crime -- hate based on sexual orientation and hate based on race.''</p>
        <p>Some in the crowd referred to their own experiences in speculating about the hatred they insisted had to be at the heart of the slaying.</p>
        <p>''The main reason he was killed was because he was black,'' said Lydia Robinson, a black woman who was born here and visits every summer from Dearborn Heights, Mich. ''Being gay didn't help him either, but if he had been white I don't think it would have gone this far. Over the last 20 years I've seen a supremacy attitude develop toward local blacks around here.''</p>
        <p>If convicted as juveniles, the two teenagers could be freed when they turn 21. If convicted as adults, they would face life in prison. In the face of such extreme alternatives, plus the dearth of information, the throng lighted candles, sang hymns and pledged unity as they demanded that the authorities not stint in prosecuting the case against the victim, known by friends as ''J. R.''</p>
        <p>Looking over at the protest signs about hell, Rick Ravenscroft, a white man who told of long-standing ties between some black and white families, declared, ''J. R. Warren is my friend and where J. R. is right now is with love, and the rest of us are just who we are.''</p>
        <p>In Grant Town, an old coal-mining hamlet nearby where Mr. Warren lived, the Rev. Nelson Staples, the victim's pastor at Mount Beulah Baptist Church, said that ''J. R. was a gentle soul'' who confided in him some casual instances of harassment that he was able to weather.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in the past decade the church has been firebombed, smeared with racist epithets and shot at by night-riders, Mr. Staples said, calling the incidents ''this spirit of evil that occasionally arises'' among some in the community.</p>
        <p>But he emphasized that the killing of Mr. Warren was the worst possible reminder of the long-standing need for reconciliation.</p>
        <p>''J. R. had a great sense of humor, but he must have lived a very anguished life trying to find a place to fit in,'' Mr. Staples said, wondering aloud whether the sudden burst of attention on Grant Town would disappear just as suddenly as the crowd did after the memorial. ''One thing about J. R., he was always forgiving,'' the pastor added. ''He was always forgiving.''</p>
