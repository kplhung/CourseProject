        <p>Alvin Darby letter, commenting on July 6 article, says apologies by Hartford Courant for running slave ads in 18th and 19th centuries and by Aetna Inc for profiting from slavery by issuing insurance policies on slaves are pointless since they do nothing to help conditions of African-Americans in general and advancement of black people</p>

        <p>Re ''A Newspaper Apologizes for Slave-Era Ads'' (news article, July 6): As a black person and someone concerned with issues affecting African-Americans, I think that the apologies -- by The Hartford Courant for running slave ads in the 18th and 19th centuries and by Aetna Inc. for profiting from slavery by issuing insurance policies on slaves in the 1850's -- were relatively pointless, because they do nothing to help the conditions of African-Americans in general and the advancement of black people.</p>

        <p>Re ''A Newspaper Apologizes for Slave-Era Ads'' (news article, July 6): As a black person and someone concerned with issues affecting African-Americans, I think that the apologies -- by The Hartford Courant for running slave ads in the 18th and 19th centuries and by Aetna Inc. for profiting from slavery by issuing insurance policies on slaves in the 1850's -- were relatively pointless, because they do nothing to help the conditions of African-Americans in general and the advancement of black people.</p>
        <p>The comment by Aristede Hill, a youth program director at the Hartford Y.M.C.A., regarding The Courant's apology -- ''I think it makes a big difference'' -- was lost on me. A big difference to whom?</p>
        <p>An apology doesn't erase the crime, drugs and lack of education and capital that is rampant in most black communities across the United States. Furthermore, it doesn't do anything for the blacks who were slaves.</p>
        <p>And what is the point of an apology if certain people still have ill will and feelings toward black people in their hearts? What we blacks can do to better ourselves must become the main issue. Until then, America will remain at a standstill on racial matters.</p>
