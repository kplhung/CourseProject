        <p>Marcel Ospel, the chief executive of UBS A.G. in Zurich, built much of his career by buying American. But while his $12 billion deal to acquire the PaineWebber Group gives his huge Swiss bank a big new position in the United States, Mr. Ospel is in many ways a man under fire.</p>
        <p>UBS, formed through the merger in 1998 of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, has spent much of the last two years struggling to find its focus and balance. Its previous chief executive, Mathis Cabiallavata, resigned after UBS amassed huge losses lending money to the ill-fated American hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ospel, 50, former head of Swiss Bank, took over with the goals of sharply reducing the combined bank's exposure to risk and refocusing on what seemed to be its essential strength as a Swiss bank with global reach: managing money for wealthy individuals worldwide.</p>
        <p>But Swiss banking is under siege from global competition, as are banks across Europe. Much of that competition is from Wall Street investment banks, which have aggressively moved into the role of advisers to top European corporations. Much of the pressure also comes from the United States' standing as the biggest and probably fastest-growing market for affluent financial customers.</p>
        <p>Although UBS is one of the world's biggest banks, with roughly $1 trillion in assets under management, its vaunted private banking business slumped badly last year.</p>
        <p>Just today, UBS disclosed that profit in its private banking area dropped 18 percent in the second quarter just ended, compared with the first quarter. In a terse announcement regarding its second-quarter earnings, UBS said ''preliminary indications are that net new money and asset growth remain disappointing.'' That news comes three months after Mr. Ospel ousted the previous head of private banking and announced a broad restructuring of the operation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ospel has also been under tremendous pressure, from investors as well as some UBS executives, to sell the investment banking business Warburg Dillon Read. That did not happen, but UBS did scale back on its trading activities in the United States and many Warburg executives defected to other firms.</p>
        <p>The PaineWebber deal is supposed to solve these and other problems. Using PaineWebber's network of 8,500 brokers in the United States, Mr. Ospel hopes to reach a huge new market of wealthy Americans, shore up his wobbly private banking business and sharply increase UBS's total assets under management.</p>
        <p>The bank is paying a high price for PaineWebber, 47 percent above the broker's stock price before the deal was announced. To keep more executives from fleeing to rivals, UBS has allocated $875 million for incentive payments. And it estimates restructuring costs around $400 million.</p>
        <p>Analysts predict that PaineWebber will not do much to help Warburg take on the likes of the Goldman Sachs Group or Merrill Lynch in the hotly competitive arenas of advising on mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance. Though Warburg has a strong investment banking business in Europe, it is considered second tier in the United States, and PaineWebber's primary strength is as a retail broker.</p>
        <p>But industry experts said UBS did not have many realistic choices of American partners, and PaineWebber's strengths should complement those of UBS.</p>
        <p>''It makes a lot of sense strategically,'' said Madeleine Hofmann, banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Zurich. ''UBS Warburg has very good people in private banking and investment banking, but in the U.S. they really did not have retail distribution. The major point is to build the affluent-client segment abroad, outside Switzerland.''</p>
        <p>Others had lukewarm reactions. ''It is not the ideal acquisition, but realistically it is as close to the ideal as you can get,'' said Bryan Crossley, a banking analyst at ABN Amro. ''It doesn't really get them to the top level, but to do that you would have had to acquire somebody like Merrill Lynch, which is a different proposition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ospel has considerable experience with American acquisitions. At the old Swiss Bank Corporation, he played a central role in 1995 in acquiring SG Warburg, then a dreary spinoff from Morgan Stanley, and in 1997 he acquired Dillon Read, then a boutique corporate advisory firm. Swiss Bank also acquired two small but valuable firms in Chicago: a derivatives business, O'Connor Associates, that gave it a solid base in what turned out to be a profitable area of trading, and Brinson Asset Management, a thriving money management firm.</p>
        <p>Industry executives say that Swiss Bank, smaller and scrappier than the Union Bank of Switzerland, did a good job of melding the longtime rivals together and letting executives who were not Swiss continue to build those businesses on their own.</p>
        <p>By some estimates, Warburg Dillon Read might have sold for as much as $18 billion if UBS had offered it last year.</p>
        <p>Some of UBS's problems reflect the rocky integration of its two Swiss components. Mr. Cabiallavata came from the bigger but stodgier Union Bank; Mr. Ospel from Swiss Bank. Mr. Cabiallavata pushed through a grueling cutback, closing branches and getting rid of many executives.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cabiallavata resigned, taking responsibility for the losses incurred on the loans to Long-Term Capital, Mr. Ospel took over and the company came largely under the management of former Swiss Bank executives.</p>
        <p>UBS performance improved considerably in 1999, as net income doubled from 6.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.9 billion. Much of that gain came from Warburg's investment banking business, which surged as the financial markets did in general. But profit in private banking shrank 39 percent and the bank's asset management business lost many big customers.</p>
