        <p>Expensive, light-reflecting marble was used in remodeling of TriBeCa loft of Dr Tilman Friedrich and wife Carolta Vollhardt (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>DOORS and walls made of light-reflecting marble can be weighty, both in pounds and dollars. While the  3/4-inch marble used to face the loft's 450-pound wood and steel doors is $10 a square foot when unfinished, when cut, polished and installed, it costs as much as $100 a square foot.</p>
        <p>The cost of those doors plus the etched-glass bedroom door and the 60-foot-long wall, including marble, steel support and frame, clerestory and recessed lighting, was around $90,000, or about $1,500 a linear foot, said Derek Huntington, whose company, ZZZ Carpentry, built and installed them. Jeremy Lebensohn, in Brooklyn, fabricated the steel.</p>

Jeremy Lebensohn, in Brooklyn, fabricated the steel.</p>
        <p>There is, however, a less expensive way to build a similar wall. Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects, the firm that designed the loft, said that Venetian plaster comes close to marble in terms of reflecting light and can be applied on top of drywall, which weighs and costs relatively little.</p>
        <p>Venetian plaster begins with a layer or two of ordinary plaster and finishes with a mix of plaster, wax and tints. A craftsman might charge $15 to $20 a square foot to create a  3/4-inch wall of Venetian plaster, Mr. Huntington said. The drywall and installation would be extra.
