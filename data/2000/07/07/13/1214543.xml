        <p>The Yankees have been hoarding prospects since making the trade for Chuck Knoblauch in February 1998, refusing to unload top minor leaguers in proposed deals for Randy Johnson, Jim Edmonds and Sammy Sosa.</p>
        <p>But with the Yankees underachieving in the American League East, club executives have traded a truckload of minor leaguers in the last two weeks for David Justice and, yesterday, for pitcher Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>''We're better today in the major leagues than we were yesterday,'' said Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president for baseball operations. ''We've got fewer prospects, though.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees traded Drew Henson and Jackson Melian -- two of the farm system's crown jewels -- in a four-player deal for Neagle, along with the left-handed pitcher Ed Yarnall and the right-hander Brian Reith.</p>
        <p>The Yankees sent the outfielder Ricky Ledee to Cleveland for Justice on June 29, and the Indians will pick two pitchers from a group of seven before July 31. Reith had been on the list, as well, but the Indians made it clear they don't intend to pick him.</p>
        <p>In the end, Cleveland could pick the right-hander Jake Westbrook and the left-hander Randy Keisler, meaning that in less than a month, the Yankees could lose three-fifths of their Class AAA rotation.</p>
        <p>''We've stockpiled pitchers in deals we've made the last couple of years,'' said Newman, mentioning the deals for Hideki Irabu and Mike Lowell. ''We've guarded our prospects closely the past couple of years because we haven't been in the situation where we needed to make a move. We've done all of that looking toward the time when we'd have to make a move, and we all felt this was the time.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult, but we're in this business to win the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Incredibly, Alfonso Soriano has not been traded. The middle infielder has been included in just about every major trade discussed in the last year, but he is still with Class AAA Columbus, still developing.</p>
        <p>It appears that Soriano will still be with the team after the July 31 trade deadline, and if that happens, then he could contend for a starting job with the Yankees next year, either at second base (if Knoblauch is shifted to designated hitter) or in the outfield.</p>
        <p>D'Angelo Jimenez, who broke a bone in his neck in an off-season car accident, is coming back and could also compete for second base next year.</p>
        <p>Nick Johnson, a first baseman, is still sidelined with a wrist injury he suffered in spring training. Adrian Hernandez, a Cuban defector who adopted the mannerisms of Orlando Hernandez, is not the Yankees' top pitching prospect.</p>
        <p>In general, however, scouts say the Yankees are thin in prospects and in the top two levels of their system.</p>
        <p>''We will replenish,'' Newman said.</p>
