        <p>Clouds of dust enveloped the riders who galloped across a field, wooden spears in hand, on a recent Sunday afternoon in this former capital of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
        <p>When one rider came close enough to a competitor, he would hurl his spear, hoping to score six points by hitting him. Forcing an opponent's horse to veer off course counts for three points. A rider who falls from his horse loses three points and the respect of the crowd.</p>
        <p>This lightning-fast sport, played only in Turkey, is a throwback to the days when Ottoman cavalrymen were among the world's most fearsome warriors. After a long period of decline, it is enjoying a rebirth of popularity.</p>
        <p>Cirit, as the sport is called, is most popular in eastern Turkey, where traditions of horsemanship are still strong. But four years ago its promoters won official recognition as a sport federation like any other, and the Istanbul competition was part of an effort to introduce it to a wider audience.</p>
        <p>The federation has codified the rules of cirit (pronounced jir-IT), recognized 34 seven-man teams and begun looking for sponsors. It also supports a formal training course for aspiring players at the University of Erzincan, an eastern city where the sport has been popular for centuries.</p>
        <p>''Look at the riders here today,'' said Alper Yazoglu, the federation's director. ''Some have gray hair, but there are also plenty who are 16 or 17 years old. People are realizing that we need to hold on to the cirit tradition. It's part of our culture, part of what it means to be a Turk.''</p>
        <p>Cirit is exciting even to outsiders who do not appreciate its subtleties. The horses are magnificent creatures of Arabian stock, agile as polo ponies and able to accelerate to great speed in a few strides.</p>
        <p>Play begins with teams lined up at opposing ends of the 140-yard-long field. Each competitor performs a series of passes, seeking to throw his spear or disorient his opponent's horse in a blurry encounter that flashes by in a few seconds.</p>
        <p>''I learned from my father, and he learned from his father,'' said Sami Gunel, who at 49 is one of the oldest certified competitors. ''When I was growing up it was something people did in villages. You'd see kids playing on their own, out in the fields. Nowadays people seem more interested in cars then horses, but when I see a big crowd like this, I think maybe we'll be able to save this sport after all.''</p>
        <p>People are thought to have begun riding horses 4,500 years ago on the steppes of Central Asia, and the first to do so were probably ancestors of today's Turks. So were the first mounted archers, who took to the field in the 8th century B.C. on the vast plains north of the Caspian and Black Seas.</p>
        <p>Turkic tribesmen spent much of their lives on horseback. Children were put on sheep's backs before they could walk so they could learn the feel of riding. Adults ate, drank, conducted business, held meetings and even slept on horseback. The ancient Chinese called them ''horse barbarians.''</p>
        <p>Some Turkic peoples in Central Asia still play games on horseback. The most accomplished among them may be the Kyrgyz, who have one game in which teams of horsemen fight to throw a goat's carcass into an opposing goal and another in which women on horseback gallop away from pursuing men who try to steal high-speed kisses.</p>
        <p>Cirit -- the name means javelin -- was devised about 500 years ago as a form of training and exercise for cavalrymen of the Ottoman Empire. The field on which the recent Istanbul competition was staged is said to have been used for the same purpose centuries ago.</p>
        <p>Although many Ottoman soldiers came from Christian backgrounds, the spahis, or cavalrymen, were Muslim Turks. They were considered almost helpless when on foot but invincible when mounted. To gallop at full speed, turn backward and shoot a deadly arrow at a distant foe was only one of their many skills.</p>
        <p>''Give him his horse,'' wrote one historian, ''hand him his bow, din in his ears his commander's roar -- 'Come on, my wolves!' -- and you had, if not the first centaur to bear arms since the days of myth, then a man at any rate hard to tell apart from his horse.''</p>
        <p>The Ottoman army marched off to war almost every spring, and to keep their skills sharp during the winter the spahis developed games to be played on horseback. One involved hurling a lance through a ring while galloping. Another required the rider to fire an arrow at a suspended brass ball.</p>
        <p>Cirit evolved from these games. It faded in the 20th century as new forms of warfare replaced archery and new machines weakened the tie between rural people and their horses. But today, young men from eastern Turkey are again embracing it.</p>
        <p>Promoters hope that competitions in Istanbul and other western cities will make cirit a national sport. Once they achieve that, they want to take it abroad.</p>
        <p>Many people in the Istanbul crowd were migrants whose families had moved from Erzincan, Erzurum, Bayburt and other cities that are traditional cirit centers. But there were also some who had no connection to the sport or the region that had nurtured it.</p>
        <p>''This is my second cirit match, and this time I brought my daughter,'' said Zafer Oguzcanoglu, a shopkeeper who has lived all his life in Istanbul.</p>
        <p>''It's a thrilling thing to see, and it's getting more popular all the time,'' he said. ''The next step is to get matches on TV. Then the riders will become big stars, and we'll send them all over the world to show people what a great sport this is.''</p>
