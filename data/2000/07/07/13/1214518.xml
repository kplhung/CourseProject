        <p>Women at high risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS should not use the widely sold spermicide, nonoxynol-9, because it may increase the risk of H.I.V. rather than protect against it, the United Nations warned today.</p>
        <p>The bulk of evidence from a number of trials shows that nonoxynol-9 is either ineffective or, if used very frequently, could be harmful as an anti-H.I.V. agent, said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who oversaw the study for Unaids, a joint United Nations agency, at a news conference here today.  ''If you use nonoxynol-9, you are either wasting your money or possibly wasting your life,'' Dr. Perriens said at the 13th international AIDS conference here.</p>

        <p>Women at high risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS should not use the widely sold spermicide, nonoxynol-9, because it may increase the risk of H.I.V. rather than protect against it, the United Nations warned today.</p>
        <p>The bulk of evidence from a number of trials shows that nonoxynol-9 is either ineffective or, if used very frequently, could be harmful as an anti-H.I.V. agent, said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who oversaw the study for Unaids, a joint United Nations agency, at a news conference here today.  ''If you use nonoxynol-9, you are either wasting your money or possibly wasting your life,'' Dr. Perriens said at the 13th international AIDS conference here.</p>
        <p>Nonoxynol-9 is marketed as a contraceptive, and the chemical is also included as a lubricant in many male condoms. Women using nonoxynol-9 solely as a contraceptive should not worry about the findings because normal usage generally will not cause the ulcers that are believed to increase risk of H.I.V. transmission, an official with the Food and Drug Administration in the United States said.</p>
        <p>''I think if it's used appropriately, it really shouldn't pose a risk,'' said Dr. Debra Birnkrant, deputy director of the division of anti-viral drug products at the F.D.A.</p>
        <p>For people at high risk of contracting H.I.V., ''condoms with or without nonoxynol-9 should be used,'' said Dr. Ann Duerr, chief of the H.I.V. section in the division of reproductive health at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study's implications for the small amounts of nonoxynol-9 on lubricated condoms are unclear, she said.</p>
        <p>Unaids had hoped that its study, which was conducted in three African countries and Thailand, would put nonoxynol-9 on the fast track for approval as the first effective microbicide women could apply to the vagina before intercourse to kill H.I.V. A microbicide is any substance that kills germs, and it can be formulated as a cream, gel, film or suppository.</p>
        <p>Instead, the preliminary findings reported today dealt a severe blow to efforts to develop a weapon that women in Africa desperately need to protect themselves from H.I.V. Many women in Africa and elsewhere are forced to have unprotected sex with their husbands who are infected. In some African countries, more than 20 percent of the adult population and 30 percent of pregnant women are H.I.V. infected.</p>
        <p>The findings were more bad news at a meeting characterized by a number of disappointments and few advances. In contrast to the euphoria at the 1996 meeting in Vancouver, where scientists spoke about the possibility of curing AIDS, here they have said that such hopes are unfounded until new and improved weapons are found. Instead, they say, they must find new ways to use what they have at hand.</p>
        <p>And every day, conference participants have been badgered with depressing figures. They heard how South Africa, with 20 percent of its adult population infected, also has the most people living with H.I.V. --  4.2 million -- in the world. H.I.V. rates exceed 10 percent in 16 countries in the southern region of Africa.</p>
        <p>Unaids, the World Health Organization and a number of groups representing advocates for a vaginal microbicide for H.I.V. said that, despite the setback, they were committed to finding an effective microbicide.</p>
        <p>''This study was a lost battle'' in that effort, Dr. Perriens said. ''We have a war ahead of us and we think this war can be won.''</p>
        <p>At least 36 other compounds are now at the preclinical testing stage, while 20 are ready for early safety trials in human volunteers. Three additional compounds are being considered for large-scale trials.</p>
        <p>Unaids decided to try to use nonoxynol-9 as a microbicide because the spermicide was inexpensive, showed activity against H.I.V. in laboratory tests and could prevent infection from the simian immune deficiency virus among macaques.</p>
        <p>The Unaids study involved AdvantageS, a nonoxynol-9 product that the Miami-based Columbia Laboratories markets in the United States and China. AdvantageS was developed and marketed as a contraceptive, not as a way to prevent infections. Columbia helped pay for the Unaids study, which was conducted in Benin, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Thailand.</p>
        <p>The 999 participants were prostitutes who were offered free condoms, counseling, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and treatment throughout the study. All of the women were encouraged to use AdvantageS and a condom each time they had sex. They had sex with an average of four partners each day, and the range was from 1 to 20 partners. The participants said that nearly 90 percent of the acts were protected by condoms.</p>
        <p>The participants agreed to be randomly assigned to use either AdvantageS or Replens, a vaginal moisturizer without nonoxynol-9.</p>
        <p>In the study, 59 women in the AdvantageS group became H.I.V. infected compared to 41 in the Replens group, a difference that was significant by statistical tests.</p>
        <p>There were more genital ulcers in the AdvantageS group than in the Replens group, said Dr. Lut Van Damme, the study's scientific coordinator from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Dr. Van Damme said that the finding led her team to suspect that the ulcers made it easier for H.I.V. to infect women.</p>
        <p>Nonoxynol-9's tendency to cause ulcers is ''a known risk if used to excess,'' said Dr. Birnkrant. Using it according to directions should not cause the ulcers, she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Howard L. Levine, a Columbia vice president, said his company was keeping the F.D.A. informed of the findings. He urged caution in interpreting the findings until the final analysis is completed in a few months. The study provided the worst-case scenario for AdvantageS because many of the prostitutes in the study had more sexual acts a day than in Columbia's tests of the product, Dr. Levine said.</p>
        <p>The findings have led scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop a study they had planned to conduct in Los Angeles and Miami among women at high risk for H.I.V.</p>
