        <p>WHITE PLAINS: MALE PRISON GUARDS SUE  The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has ruled that Westchester County erred in banning male guards from patrolling housing blocks for female inmates in March after a jailhouse sex scandal, but the county will not change its policy, said Larry S. Schwartz, chief adviser to the county executive, Andrew J. Spano. Mr. Schwartz said yesterday, ''We think female correction officers should guard female inmates, period.'' The federal ruling is not binding, but a lawyer for the correction officers' union said the county's response might prompt the Justice Department to join the union's federal lawsuit to lift the ban.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: KOCH'S CAR STOLEN  A limousine owned by former Mayor Edward I. Koch was reported stolen yesterday in Queens, the police said. Mr. Koch's chauffeur, Howard G. Geary, parked the 1998 Lincoln Town Car at 59th Street and Queens Boulevard in Woodside, near his home, at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, the police said. When he went to the corner at 7 a.m. yesterday, the car was gone.</p>

        <p>ROCKY POINT: TEENAGE HACKER CHARGED  A 15-year-old boy was arrested Tuesday and accused of gaining unauthorized access to three NASA computers and defacing the space agency's Web site, the Suffolk County Police said yesterday. They said that the boy, a student at Rocky Point High School who was not identified because of his age, broke into two computers in Hampton, Va., and one in Bethpage, N.Y., in November and added the message ''SSH is coming'' to the Web site. The police said they believed the initials stood for Sesame Street Haxorz, the boy's on-line name. He had posted a picture of the Muppet Elmo with the message.</p>

        <p>EASTON: E. COLI PREVENTION  Washington County Fair officials said a $100,000 water system was being installed to ensure clean water at the fairgrounds after an outbreak of E. coli at last year's fair caused two deaths and more than 1,000 suspected cases. New wells will be hooked to a purification system that includes chlorination and filtering, said Pete Gregg, a spokesman for the fair, which is to be held from Aug. 21 to Aug. 27. Researchers had concluded that the E. coli found last year came from a well at the fairgrounds.</p>

        <p>NORTH SALEM: BARN FIRE CALLED AN ACCIDENT  A fire in a barn at a horse farm in northern Westchester Monday morning that killed 31 horses was caused by an electrical malfunction, a state investigator said yesterday. The blaze at Breakaway Farms on Route 121 in North Salem, 40 miles north of New York City, broke out around 5:15 a.m., and the wooden barn was engulfed by the time firefighters arrived. There were fire sensors in the barn, but it was unclear whether they were working, an investigator said.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: GASOLINE ADDITIVE SUIT  An industry group said yesterday that it was challenging New York's ban on MTBE, a gasoline additive that reduces air pollution but increases water pollution. The Oxygenated Fuels Association said it had filed a suit in federal court in Albany on Tuesday calling for the ban to be declared invalid. The state law phasing out the use of MTBE by 2004 was the first in the nation. The Arlington, Va., coalition of MTBE manufacturers said that New York could not unilaterally impose regulations that were more stringent than federal law.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: EMISSIONS PROGRAM FAULTED  Envirotest Systems, the contractor that runs Connecticut's troubled vehicle emissions program, was criticized by legislators yesterday. Four company employees have pleaded guilty to taking bribes to clear vehicles that did not pass emissions tests. During the hearing, legislators chastised Envirotest executives for being too slow to use antifraud measures. Company officials announced a $1 million plan last month to prevent future fraud.</p>

        <p>VERNON: TRIAL IN TROOPER SHOOTING  A 42-year-old Willington man is to be tried on charges that he shot three state troopers two years ago outside his trailer home. The man, Edward Premo, was found competent to stand trial during a hearing Tuesday in Rockville Superior Court. He is accused of shooting three troopers on Sept. 3, 1998, as they responded to a call that he had backed his van into a neighbor's car. All three were seriously injured, but have recovered.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: SCHOOL VIOLENCE DOWN  Incidents of violence, vandalism, weapons possession and substance abuse in New Jersey public schools declined by 7 percent in the 1998-99 school year, according to a report released yesterday by the State Department of Education. But incidents like verbal threats in which the victims were school employees rose by 30 percent, and bomb scares more than doubled, to 395 last year from 175 in the 1997-98 school year, the report said. The commissioner of education, David Hespe, said he was encouraged by the overall decrease, and credited increased reporting by school officials for the ''clearer picture of the frequency and nature of disruptive behavior in our schools.''</p>

        <p>TRENTON: WEST NILE VIRUS STUDY  Officials will trap sparrows in northern New Jersey and draw samples of their blood in an effort to track West Nile virus and learn how it is transmitted. To do the study, which is scheduled to start on Saturday, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  Geological Survey and state and local agencies will snare the birds in fine-meshed nets, draw a small sample of their blood, band them and release them. The study is expected to last about a week, and will take place in Bergen, Passaic and Morris Counties.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: MUSLIM DIETARY REGULATION  Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a bill yesterday requiring any dealer or restaurant preparing or selling food designated in the Muslim faith as ''halal'' -- the Arabic word for permitted -- to post conspicuously that it does so, and hold to those preparation standards. The law is similar to one protecting the purity of kosher food for Jews. About 300,000 Muslims live in New Jersey.</p>
