        <p>Mike Murphy, the campaign television advertising gladiator who brought you Senator John McCain, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Oliver L. North, was parked briefly the other 18-hour day in his editing room in Falls Church, Va., engaged in his usual multitasking. He simultaneously e-mailed a friend, talked on his cell phone, snacked on candy and, not least, eyed film footage of his latest client, Representative Rick A. Lazio, as Mr. Lazio announced his Senate candidacy against the first lady in a West Islip gym.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, just mark that smile look there,'' Mr. Murphy told his assistant.</p>
        <p>''And I know you can tell from my accent that I'm a lifelong New Yorker,''  Mr. Lazio said on the screen.</p>
        <p>''Good smile, too,'' Mr. Murphy said, spotting a Lazio poster in the same shot. ''Get that with the sign.''</p>
        <p>''Being a husband and a father and a neighbor are what I cherish most. I want that dream of opportunity and safety and a limitless future for my children . . . .''</p>
        <p>''Back it up,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Let me hear that line from the end.''</p>
        <p>As he worked, he thought ahead to his filming for some Fourth of July parades, and also to the candidate's wardrobe. ''Yeah, I'll probably send him a note on like, you know, 'Bring an extra pair of khakis and a couple of shirts.' ''</p>
        <p>Sure enough, during Mr. Lazio's statewide bus tour last week, the candidate changed from a dress shirt to a blue-and-white checked number before sitting down in front of a camera on a hay bale on a dairy farm in Burke, not far from Canada. Mr. Murphy and his film crew were there, and everywhere. ''Walk about eight feet behind the camera and do some waving,'' he instructed Mr. Lazio during a parade in the town of Argyle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy also accompanied Mr. Lazio aboard the press bus for a talk with reporters, and sat near Mr. Lazio during a one-on-one interview, chiming in to help bat down a rumor that Mr. Lazio would deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Lazio, Mr. Murphy said, would spend only a short time at the convention.</p>
        <p>''We have work to do here in New York,'' Mr. Murphy intoned. Indeed. On a subsequent appearance on CNN's ''Crossfire,'' Mr. Murphy joked that he had three things to say: ''www.lazio.com; get out your credit cards; send us some money.''</p>
        <p>In the two fast months since Rick Lazio stepped in as the understudy to replace Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mike Murphy has commandeered a lurching campaign still in the test-drive phase. Fresh from his most recent job as strategist and court jester on Mr. McCain's presidential campaign bus, the Straight Talk Express, Mr. Murphy is considered among the G.O.P.'s notorious best -- the quick-witted, indispensable bad boy of Republican politics, and the creator of some of the best-known attack ads in the business.</p>
        <p>''I started speaking to Mike last year, and I was very impressed with him,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I'm very compatible with him, chemistry-wise.'' It was Mr. Murphy, Mr. Lazio said, who urged him to quickly issue a press release and ''just lay it out there'' after the Securities and Exchange Commission began last month to investigate the candidate's trading in stock options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy was also on hand as Mr. Lazio sometimes stammered through a hammering by reporters last week about a harsh fund-raising letter that said the Clintons had embarrassed the country. At one point, when Mr. Lazio looked puzzled after a reporter asked whether the letter had been written by Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail marketer whom Mr. Giuliani had used against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lazio looked over at Mr. Murphy, who then jumped in to help. ''I don't believe that Viguerie is doing any direct mail for us whatsoever,'' Mr. Murphy said flatly.</p>
        <p>As the man who serves as the campaign's chief strategist and also makes its commercials, Mr. Murphy, 38, began preparing for a Lazio run in the weeks before Mr. Giuliani dropped out, and long before Bill Dal Col moved in as the campaign manager in charge of day-to-day operations. And while Mrs. Clinton has perhaps defensively surrounded herself with New Yorkers or former New Yorkers, Mr. Lazio has reached for an out-of-state professional -- one who was raised in a Democratic household in Michigan, and who now lives in a $1.3 million Georgetown Victorian in Washington.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Murphy is known for managing tough races, even if he has rarely worked in New York. He has supplanted, to much Republican gossip, Kieran Mahoney and Arthur Finkelstein, the team of Gov. George E. Pataki and former Senator Alfonse D'Amato that has managed virtually every Republican statewide race in New York over the last decade. At the same time, Mr. Murphy has to work alongside the entire Pataki-D'Amato fund-raising operation taken on by Mr. Lazio. Whatever tensions that some Republicans say exist are denied, for now, by the principals: ''He's a smart guy whose opinions are worth listening to,'' said Mr. Mahoney, who said he was tired of managing political campaigns.</p>
        <p>Not incidentally, Mr. Murphy is also known for painting himself as a central character in his endeavors. ''Mike has a tendency of taking credit for things that he only observed,'' said John Weaver, Mr. McCain's political director, who was enraged when Mr. Murphy disclosed months of McCain campaign secrets for an article in The Washington Post that cast Mr. Murphy as a star.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain said: ''Listen, I love Mike, O.K.? But in that case, he should have given more credit to others.''</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Murphy's strategy is to position Mr. Lazio in the center, independent of the Republican right wing, and to build up his confidence for prime time. ''Mike is a great hand-holder,'' said the strategist Ed Rollins, who worked with Mr. Murphy in Mrs. Whitman's race for governor in 1993, when Mr. Rollins's boast, later recanted, that black ministers were paid to suppress the black vote got Mr. Murphy grilled by the F.B.I. ''He just makes you feel comfortable.''</p>
        <p>To the point with Mrs. Whitman, Mr. Rollins said, that Mr. Murphy was allowed great liberties: ''Mike is a guy who'd walk into her closet and literally pick out the clothes he wanted her to wear.'' Similarly, Mr. McCain credits Mr. Murphy with making him laugh and lifting his spirits. ''If I wasn't at the top of my game, he'd say, 'Look, get back up,' '' Mr. McCain said. ''He was like a cheerleader.''</p>
        <p>His ads tell another story. It was Mr. Murphy who made the television commercial for Mr. North's 1994 Senate campaign that attacked the incumbent, Senator Charles S. Robb, for his partying and his relationship with a Playboy bunny and former Miss Virginia. ''Why can't Chuck Robb tell the truth?'' the narrator asked in that ad. ''About the cocaine parties where Robb said he never saw drugs. Or about the beauty queen in the hotel room in New York. Robb says it was only a massage.''</p>
        <p>Although the ad was essentially accurate, even Mr. Murphy's friends were appalled. As it was, Mr. Murphy's mother, Joanne, a Hillary Clinton supporter, could hardly bear the thought that her son was working for Mr. North of Iran-contra notoriety. ''I think I said something like, 'Oliver North?' '' Joanne Murphy recalled.</p>
        <p>It was also Mr. Murphy who had to tone down his commercials for Mrs. Whitman in her 1993 run for governor, at the candidate's request. ''He initially liked that dour, make-it-sound-like-the-world-is-coming-to-an-end background music,'' Mrs. Whitman said.</p>
        <p>And it was Mr. Murphy who made such a barbed commercial for Spencer Abraham of Michigan against his unsuccessful Democratic challenger, Representative Bob Carr, that Mr. Carr's political consultant at the time, Marla Romash, still remembers that 1994 Senate race with bitterness. (In the commercial, Mr. Murphy exaggerated the size of the Congressional pension that Mr. Carr would receive, an error Mr. Murphy later said was based on bad information and corrected.) ''I don't think I've ever created an ad that was intentionally inaccurate in any way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''He's the best Republicans have to offer,'' Ms. Romash said, ''but he is irresponsible, and he is dangerous.''</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Murphy has made only two commercials for Mr. Lazio -- the first a homey 60-second introduction of a Suffolk County Tom Sawyer, the second a mild counterattack to negative commercials that Mrs. Clinton's campaign broadcast last month. ''So why is she doing this?'' Mr. Lazio asks, dressed casually in a blue blazer and staring amiably into the camera. ''Because it's a lot easier for Mrs. Clinton to attack me than to name a single thing she has ever done for New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy shot the commercial at Mr. Lazio's home in Brightwaters on a Saturday, edited it in Falls Church early Sunday and had it on the air by Tuesday. When Mr. Murphy isn't on the campaign bus, in the new Lazio headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, in his Falls Church office, in Michigan working for Mr. Abraham's difficult re-election campaign or at home in Georgetown (almost never), he can be found in the watering holes of the Northeast Corridor. Not long ago, that was the lobby lounge of the Four Seasons Hotel on East 57th Street, a favorite spot, where he had a Diet Coke and chicken skewers and fidgeted with a laptop. With his black-rimmed glasses, long blond hair and three-day blond stubble, Mr. Murphy looked like a screenwriter after a long night.</p>
        <p>In fact, he said he had a ''good campaign kind of comedy'' in the works. ''I mean, I've written a few treatments,'' he said. ''I'm fooling around with the usual West Coast thing, though I don't know if I could stand the culture.'' .</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy grew up upper middle class outside Detroit in Grosse Pointe Park, one of the Grosse Pointe suburbs, he said, ''that's not quite as ritzy as the other ones.'' Still, his father was the general counsel for Michigan Blue Cross-Blue Shield. His mother was a freelance writer and a Democratic precinct committeewoman. His grandfather was a longtime Democratic judge.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Mr. Murphy has answered questions about how he became a Republican with a joke -- ''My father says it was a head injury when I was young'' -- but when pressed, argued that it wasn't all that unusual an occurrence ''in an Irish-Catholic, fairly thoughtful family in 1979 Midwestern America.'' He was disillusioned by the Carter presidency, he said, which coincided with his high school years, a time when he immersed himself in American foreign policy. He was also attracted by the neo-conservative movement of the era. ''I mean the whole neo-con movement was run basically by Jews and Irish moving from Democratic backgrounds to conservative,'' Mr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>His mother thinks that there was also some rebellion against his parents, and that his surroundings played a part. ''He grew up in an affluent suburb where the majority of people were Republicans,'' she said, ''which I think had a lot to do with it.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, Mr. Murphy quickly joined the campus Republicans when he entered Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in the fall of 1980, then got a job as an intern under Terry Dolan, the founder of the Reagan-era National Conservative Political Action Committee, which aggressively tried to defeat Democratic and liberal Republican politicians. His mother, hardly pleased, rationalized. ''Terry Dolan let him start writing ads,'' she said. ''He was 20 years old.''</p>
        <p>By his senior year, Mr. Murphy had dropped out of Georgetown for full-time politics. His first big client, in 1984, was Representative William Carney of Long Island, the incumbent who won. Mr. Murphy worked his way to the outskirts of the presidential campaign of Bob Dole in 1988 and to the primaries of George Bush in 1992. By 1996, he was in the center of the action as the chief strategist for Lamar Alexander's presidential run. His other clients have included Govs. Jeb Bush of Florida and John Engler of Michigan. He met Mr. Lazio through Cliff Pintak, a partner in his political consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy says this is his last hurrah -- ''it's a fun, big honking Senate race'' -- but no one believes him. ''I don't think Mike can have a last campaign,'' Mr. Weaver said. Meanwhile, his mother is offering advice. ''Lazio seems young,'' she said she e-mailed her son recently. ''You're going to have to make him look like a senator.'' To her, this is a sea change. ''I would never have offered Mike one word of advice,'' she said, ''on Oliver North.''</p>
