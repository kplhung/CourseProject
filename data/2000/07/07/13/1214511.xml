        <p>Global Crossing, the telecommunications company, agreed yesterday to sell its local phone operations to Citizens Communications for $3.65 billion in cash, which Global will use to further its construction of a worldwide communications network.</p>
        <p>The deal transfers to Citizens about one million phone lines in Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and about 3,000 employees. Citizens, based in Stamford, Conn., is increasingly focused on telecommunications as it sheds its utility businesses.</p>
        <p>Global Crossing, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, acquired the local phone business last year in its takeover of the Frontier Corporation. The company decided to exit the local phone market to concentrate on building a network capable of handling huge amounts of Internet and data traffic worldwide.</p>
        <p>''The downside of this deal is that it removes an important source of cash flow for Global Crossing,'' said Michael Hodel, a telecommunications analyst with Morningstar, the mutual fund and stock analysis company. ''But at least it alleviates some concern over funding since the rest of their operations are burning through cash.''</p>
        <p>Investors responded by bidding up Global Crossing shares $2.9375, to $32.0625. The shares have been slumping, down more than 30 percent this year, amid concern over problems in raising money in a dampened capital market for unprofitable companies focused on the Internet. In the first quarter, Global Crossing posted an operating loss of $234.1 million as it scrambled to build its network.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Citizens deal, investors and analysts absorbed reports that Global Crossing was considering selling GlobalCenter, its business that offers storage and maintenance centers for Web sites and other Internet services, to the rival Exodus Communications for as much as $7 billion in stock. Global Crossing and Exodus declined to comment on the reports, which said a deal would give Global Crossing a substantial stake in Exodus.</p>
        <p>While it builds its network, Global Crossing has also been trying to expand through acquisitions, although an overture to buy Equant N.V. of the Netherlands, the owner of the world's largest data network, ended abruptly last month when the two companies could not agree on terms.</p>
        <p>Leo Hindrey Jr., who recently joined Global Crossing as chief executive, did not support that deal, people close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>Given Global Crossing's wide-reaching strategies, some concern has emerged. In addition to acquiring Frontier last year, Global Crossing bought the cable installer Global Marine Systems and Racal Telecom of Britain.</p>
        <p>''Global Crossing is not doing a great job of articulating strategy,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''It's a young company that seems to still be deciding what they'll do when they grow up.''</p>
        <p>Originally aimed at linking the two sides of the Atlantic, Global Crossing operates or is building 12 fiber optic networks connecting Asia, the Americas and Europe in an effort to set up a worldwide broadband network to meet the growing demand for Internet and data services.</p>
        <p>While Global Crossing grows globally, smaller companies like Citizens Communications are seeking to fill gaps in local services. Earlier this year, the company sold its electric utilities business and changed its name from Citizens Utilities to Citizens Communications.</p>
        <p>''Citizens looks like they're becoming the Wal-Mart of phone service, getting into a lot of small communities,'' Mr. Kagan said. ''The people living in those places will probably benefit from the attention they will get from a Citizens, as opposed to a Global Crossing.''</p>
        <p>Shares in Citizens rose 12.5 cents, to $18.8125.</p>
