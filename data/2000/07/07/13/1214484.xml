        <p>In ''The Letter,'' the painter Jan Vermeer looks through a threshold from a darkened room. The two women he sees make no attempt to seduce the eye.

        <p>In ''The Letter,'' the painter Jan Vermeer looks through a threshold from a darkened room. The two women he sees make no attempt to seduce the eye. Their presence is as matter-of-fact as the domestic moment we have found them in, as if they had joined the pictures on the wall and checkered floor tiles as parts of a larger still life.</p>
        <p>It is the light that Vermeer casts on them, moving from left to right and from an unseen window, that so fascinates us. As the light brings the outside world in, it finds a seated woman holding a letter, presumably just delivered. Letters preoccupy the handful of pictures that survive this enigmatic 17th-century Dutch painter; they reappear nearly as often as musical instruments and serve as powerful metaphors. Indeed, the powerful tranquillity of Vermeer's interiors is made possible by this very different message bearer from without: the sunlight that filters in from a source beyond our view. It makes sense that the painter's subjects so often write letters, read them or receive them.</p>
        <p>Louis Andriessen's opera, ''Writing to Vermeer,'' which opened this year's Lincoln Center Festival at the New York State Theater on Tuesday night, wonders, as we do, what goes on beyond the walls of Vermeer's parlors and kitchens. Peter Greenaway has provided a libretto in which the women of his household write to the painter, now on a two-week trip to The Hague from his home in Delft. The imaginary letters bring everyday news, but this is 1672, perhaps Holland's most cataclysmic year.</p>
        <p>The tulip market has collapsed. French and English enemies threaten the republic. An accidental explosion has blown Vermeer's hometown very nearly off the map. There is violence in the streets. Mr. Andriessen and his co-directors, Mr. Greenaway and Saskia Boddeke, seek to show us both the history and the art, as if the silence to which Vermeer's pictures escape is best explained by the noise going on around them. The stage flows with water, and occasionally milk or blood. This large company, mostly women and children, bathe in it or are doused from above.</p>
        <p>The finale is nothing short of a flood, pouring from above and streaming down a raked stage that  itself seems to float on a lake of its own. Screens project fragments of Vermeer's work or a writing hand. As the singers sing the letters (the text is in English), we hear the scratching pen and read along as the words, projected white on black, march across the stage floor. Superimposed are animated scenes or intimate close-ups. Mr. Greenaway does not wish us to be bored.</p>
        <p>Contrast is the watchword of  ''Writing to Vermeer.'' The little versus the big, the peace of isolation against public riot, time brought to a halt against time racing frenetically forward, theatricality next to modesty. These are not easy loads to bring into balance, and one spends two hours in front of this opera trying to figure out what it is about: a painter or a stage director? Mr. Greenaway's audacity and imagination are usually welcome, but here they bully Vermeer into inconsequentiality. If the director's use of water represents the flood of events, it also depicts the drowning of a painter under a high tide of theatrics.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is by design, the intention being to depict the artist's  peacefulness overwhelmed by sheer size. And this opera does things big. Its three women are in turn played by three women each. Such multiple images fill the stage with people as they engage in busy, often spastic choreographies. Vermeer (who does not appear) is presented in spirit with such bustle and crowding that we soon lose sight of him. If ''Writing to Vermeer'' had become the study in contrasts that it promises at the outset, Mr. Greenaway's images would have had a point. Here they seem merely in competition, and this is a director who has made sure we shall look at him before we look at any picture on a wall.</p>
        <p>The opera is nearly rescued by its music, which is very beautiful. There is a sense of song in Mr. Andriessen's writing that for post-tonal composers has become both anachronism and anathema. The lines are long, sinuous and gracefully balanced. The composer has also transformed the sound and the style of early instruments. The songs and dances of Sweelinck take on the Day-Glo of electronic treatment or become warped and out of tune through the twist of a dial. History is accented by synthesized explosions or sharp thrusts. The Asko and Schonberg Ensembles are in the pit, conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw. Michel van der Aa has done much of the electronic work. The singers are all women, and all do well. Barbara Hannigan, Susan Narucki and Kathryn Harries are Saskia, Catharina and Maria. Each has two dancing mirror images.</p>
        <p>Vivid and clever as this production is, and as musically appealing as Mr. Andriessen makes it, ''Writing to Vermeer'' has a difficult time deciding what it wants to be. I went home stuffed with images of gushing waters and flowing blood and took another look at ''The Letter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andriessen's original idea was for a smaller, more modest piece, but ambition seems to have had its way. Ambition indeed created a brilliant commotion at Lincoln Center on Tuesday night, but afterward, one looked again at the source, remembered the events onstage and wondered what if anything could persuasively connect Tuesday's opera with this tiny masterpiece of stillness, barely 17 inches high and 15 across. There are three more performances, tonight, Friday and Saturday. They are in any case worth a trip.</p>
        <p>The production originates with the Netherlands Opera.</p>
