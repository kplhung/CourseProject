        <p>Three bodies were recovered yesterday from the rubble of a Brooklyn town house that exploded Tuesday night, and fire investigators said they strongly suspected that a gas leak had caused the blast.</p>
        <p>''That's the main possibility,'' Chief Fire Marshal Louis F. Garcia said. ''We're not really looking at anything else.''</p>
        <p>Fire officials suspect a gas leak because of the nature of the damage, the absence of other obvious causes and the accounts of neighbors who said they smelled gas before the explosion.</p>
        <p>Shortly before noon yesterday, firefighters discovered the body of Leonard Walit, 72, buried under tons of rubble in the basement of his town house at 420 State Street in Boerum Hill. Eight hours later, firefighters discovered the body of his friend and neighbor, Khay Cochran, 73, and, about three hours after that, found the body of Mr. Walit's wife, Harriet, 66, a retired social worker.</p>
        <p>For friends, relatives and neighbors, it was a devastating day, a day in which hope faded to nothing and a stunned neighborhood was left to confront the mystery of fate.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, Mrs. Walit  called Mr. Cochran, saying she smelled gas, neighbors said. Mr. Cochran, 73, a close friend of the Walits, went next door to help investigate. Minutes later, an explosion obliterated the Walits' place and all but obliterated the adjoining town house, which Mr. Cochran shared at 418 State Street with his longtime companion, Julian Jackson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson and another roommate, Francis Aguire, escaped with barely a scratch.</p>
        <p>Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, who spent the night supervising several hundred firefighters, said the explosion could have been touched off by something as simple as someone turning on a light or lighting a match. The explosion -- so intense that it snuffed out all flames in an instant -- appeared to have originated from the Walits' basement, knocking out supporting walls and allowing the upper floors to collapse in a heap, fire officials said.</p>
        <p>''The building just pancaked,'' said Philip J. Burns, a deputy fire chief.</p>
        <p>Investigators said it was far from clear whether the leak came from a gas service line or from an appliance. The town house, they said, had a gas stove, a gas boiler and a gas water heater. A spokesman for KeySpan Energy, the utility company that supplied the town house, said the company's investigators had not found any leaks in its supply lines.</p>
        <p>''We found zero evidence of natural gas leaking in the area,'' said Robert J. Mahoney, manager of media relations for KeySpan. He cautioned, however, that because of the damage, the company had not been able to test the service lines leading into 420 and 418 State Street.</p>
        <p>And although neighbors said they smelled gas before the explosion, Mr. Mahoney said the company's records of gas complaints did not show any telephone calls from the neighborhood on Tuesday evening.</p>
        <p>But more than a month ago, on June 5, a resident at 422 State Street complained to KeySpan about smelling gas. The odor, the resident reported, was strongest near a wall that adjoined 420 State Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahoney said KeySpan workers promptly investigated the complaint, performed extensive testing inside and outside 422 State Street, but failed to detect any leakage of gas. Given those results, he said, there was no need to test 420 State Street or other homes.</p>
        <p>But Sunni Levinson, the person who made the complaint, said the KeySpan worker who responded told her he, too, smelled gas. ''We smelled it. They smelled it,'' she said. ''When the gas man says he smells it, it has to come from somewhere, and you have to find it.'' She added, however, that in the weeks since, she has not smelled gas.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Mahoney interviewed the KeySpan investigator, he disputed Ms. Levinson's account.</p>
        <p>''Never was there a conversation with anyone about a gas smell around this wall,'' Mr. Mahoney said.</p>
