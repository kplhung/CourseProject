        <p>The Democratic National Committee's new television commercial being broadcast in 17 battleground states shows Vice President Al Gore saying that he supports an amendment to the Constitution to protect the rights of crime victims.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Pictures of Mr. Gore addressing a town meeting and talking to police officers. Near the end, there is a picture of people who  appear to be unhappy crime victims with a police officer.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Gore: ''Accused criminals have all kinds of rights. But the victims of crimes do not have rights that are always protected and guaranteed. That's why I'm for a constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights. So that for example, if somebody has been a crime victim and the person who committed that crime is about to be released, they ought to be notified. If there's a trial, they ought to have a right to speak to the jury. The people who are hurt by crime need to be heard.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Gore does support a constitutional amendment, as does Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee. Thirty-two states have laws providing victims varying rights to be heard, though usually at the time of sentencing and not when a jury is considering guilt or innocence. President Clinton called in general terms for a constitutional amendment to protect victims' rights in 1996, but his administration opposed some versions of such an amendment in Congress. One version came to the Senate floor in April, but it was withdrawn after it became clear that objections to putting such a narrow amendment in the Constitution would keep it from being passed.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The advertisement portrays Mr. Gore as a forceful defender of crime victims and as an enthusiast for the recent tendency to propose constitutional amendments to solve a variety of problems. While a detailed explanation of an amendment is not possible in a 30-second spot, one is not supplied on Mr. Gore's Web site, either. His office said there was no text of a proposed amendment.</p>
