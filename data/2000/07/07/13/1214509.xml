        <p>Former Senator Bill Bradley made it official today: he will use the ''e'' word when he appears with Vice President Al Gore on Thursday in their first joint appearance since Mr. Bradley quit the presidential race in March.</p>
        <p>In a preview of the remarks he plans to give in Wisconsin, Mr. Bradley posted a message on his Web site today saying for the first time that he would endorse Mr. Gore. And he called on his supporters to unite behind the vice president's candidacy for the good of the Democratic Party and the principles he campaigned on in the primaries, including universal health care, gun control and campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>''This morning, I will introduce Vice President Gore at a rally in Green Bay, Wis., and endorse his candidacy for the presidency,'' Mr. Bradley wrote in the message, dated July 13.</p>
        <p>''The Democratic Party is a place of many voices, but we all share the same values,'' he said. ''It's why we're Democrats. I firmly believe that as the nominee of the Democratic Party, Al Gore is the best choice for president, and I hope and expect that he will be elected in November.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's words and body language will be closely scrutinized by Democrats and political analysts on Thursday because of the bitter nature of his primary contests with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>When he quit the race after failing to win a single state, Mr. Bradley was sharply critical of the vice president's slashing campaign style, asserting that Mr. Gore had repeatedly distorted Mr. Bradley's ideas and record. And though he said at that time that he would support the vice president's candidacy, Mr. Bradley pointedly refused to use the word ''endorse.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's advisers have said that he would be far more enthusiastic about Mr. Gore in their joint appearance on Thursday. But there is little evidence of that in his Web site message. Instead, Mr. Bradley talks broadly and idealistically about the differences between the parties, while barely mentioning the vice president, other than to endorse him.</p>
        <p>''Democrats know that ultimately government can and must sometimes do the big things that individuals cannot do, the nonprofit sector doesn't have the resources to do and the private sector will not do,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley ended the message with a remark that some Bradley fans have interpreted as suggesting that he will seek to play a prominent role in the party if Mr. Gore loses in November.</p>
        <p>''I am going to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles next month, and I ask you to join me, if you are able, to be a voice for the principles that our campaign stood for,'' Mr. Bradley writes. ''These issues, and the principles that underlie them, will outlast any one national campaign. They are what we stand for as the Democratic Party.''</p>
