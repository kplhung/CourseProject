        <p>De Beers Consolidated Mines, the diamond company that reigned as one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century, announced yesterday in London a seismic shift in the way it does business.</p>
        <p>It will retreat from its 70-year-old practice of manipulating prices by hoarding the world's diamonds and will charge into the advertising-driven game of selling the stones as branded luxuries.</p>
        <p>The strategic overhaul, analysts say, was driven by the anemic performance of De Beers shares in recent years and by public-relations fears that ''conflict diamonds'' from Africa are poisoning a carefully nurtured image that De Beers stones are symbols of ''love, beauty and purity.''</p>
        <p>''We all need to become more customer- focused and recognize the power of marketing to sell more diamonds,'' Nicky Oppenheimer, the company chairman, said in a news release.</p>
        <p>De Beers, which was created 110 years ago in South Africa, controls two-thirds of the trade in uncut diamonds and owns mines around the world that produce about half the stones unearthed each year.</p>
        <p>It has been embarrassed by disclosures that to prop up prices, it bought millions of dollars of diamonds from rebels in Angola.</p>
        <p>The company has insisted that it bought the stones on the open market and stopped all buying when a United Nations embargo was imposed in 1998.</p>
        <p>In London yesterday, De Beers made the most far-reaching of a series of moves to back away from trading in diamonds mined by African rebels who brutalize civilians. The company yesterday warned its 125 major trading partners that they would be barred from buying De Beers diamonds if they trafficked in stones that originated in war zones.</p>
        <p>''De Beers is sending a clear signal to the rest of the industry that it is no longer tolerable to profit from these diamonds,'' said Christine Gordon, a diamond industry analyst in London who serves on a panel monitoring the United Nations embargo on rebel diamonds from Angola.</p>
        <p>The Security Council imposed a global ban this month on diamond exports from Sierra Leone, where the stones have fueled a savage rebel war. There are no sanctions, however, on stones from Congo, where the scramble for diamonds helps sustain a war among rebels, the government and armies from six African countries.</p>
        <p>While De Beers's move will further reduce the chances that rebel-mined diamonds will trickle into American jewelry stores, Ms. Gordon said there remained a large network of dealers who are not beholden to De Beers. In addition, human rights groups are skeptical about De Beers's ability to enforce its new rules.</p>
        <p>''It is one thing to announce all these changes, but it is another thing to make it stick,'' said Ian Smillie, co-author of a scathing report this year about how the diamond industry supplied the money that made war possible in Sierra Leone. ''There are quite a lot of diamonds coming from these areas and somebody is going to lose money if they stop dealing with the rebels.''</p>
        <p>Human Rights Watch called the De Beers move ''an important announcement,'' but said more remained to be done.</p>
        <p>''The fundamental issue is verification,'' said Carroll Bogert, a spokeswoman in the New York for the group, which has closely monitored the trade in rebel-mined diamonds. ''Unless you have an independent monitoring mechanism, I think questions will remain.''</p>
        <p>As part of the shift in business strategy, executives from De Beers said that the company would reduce its stockpile of uncut diamonds from $3.9 billion to about $2.5 billion toward the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Over the last seven decades, De Beers has used that stockpile -- which it maintains in London and as recently as last year was valued at $5.2 billion -- as a way to absorb excess diamonds from Africa, Russia or anywhere else in the world that might lower the cartel price of diamonds.</p>
        <p>With the money earned by selling off much of the stockpile, De Beers officials said they would expand spending on diamond advertising, while insisting that the company's trading partners do the same.</p>
        <p>''There's a huge untapped opportunity for all of us in the industry to grow the diamond business and match the growth rates enjoyed by leading luxury goods companies,'' said Gary Ralfe, managing director of the company.</p>
        <p>Although diamond sales have soared in the last year, De Beers's profitability has not. Much of the reason, company officials have said, is that too much capital is tied up in the diamond stockpile.</p>
        <p>Diamond sales have grown far less robustly over the last 50 years than sales of other luxury goods. By reducing the stockpile and increasing advertising, De Beers executives have said they hope to experience the sales growth of items like Gucci handbags.</p>
