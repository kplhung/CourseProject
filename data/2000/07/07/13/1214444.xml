        <p>''We wanted a building with a certain exuberance to it,'' said James T. Dowell, executive director of the Riverside Park Fund, about the Volunteer House, left, a light-hearted folly to rise next year above a one-story storage building near 106th Street. Today, it is pink-painted limestone with patches of graffiti (Mike</p>
        <p>Dottie 4life) underneath a verdigris coating of moss. The group, founded in 1986 to help pull the park's socks up, sees a day when gardening classes and volunteers will flock to this airy space nestled against the cliff below Riverside Drive.</p>
        <p>The problem has been how to encourage residents to enter the lovely park. The architect Jeffrey Murphy, of Murphy Burnham &amp; Buttrick, who has designed Volunteer House, said, ''It's a commitment to get down there.'' The park drops 45 feet below Riverside Drive to the building, then farther, to a broad promenade, then even farther, to the active sports area along the Henry Hudson Parkway. Recently, volunteers have adopted rambles and gardens, a dog run was built and the Hudson Beach Cafe opened near the new all-weather soccer field, skate park and basketball courts, much of which is the work of the fund. ''For some people, the park is forbidding, but the whole area has seen a resurgence in the last few years,'' Mr. Dowell said.</p>
