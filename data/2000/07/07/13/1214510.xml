        <p>Prof Eric Foner Op-Ed article says recent apologies by Hartford Courant and Aetna Inc for profiting from slavery during 18th and 19th centuries underscore usually glossed-over participation of North in America's slave system; says economic participation of Northern states in slave trade went much deeper, even after they no longer allowed slaveholdings within borders; notes that slaves built New York City from earliest arrival at beginning of 1600's, that they represented more than 10 percent of population in 1750 and that city was site of slave conspiracies in 1712 and 1741; says city should initiate long-term projects to increase historical self-consciousness and display historical connection to slavery (M)</p>

        <p>Retrospective apologies can be a kind of psychopolitics that makes the apologizer feel good without doing anything concrete about the enduring consequences of past injustices.

        <p>Yes, many college and even some high school textbooks make clear that slavery was embedded in every aspect of American life -- not just Southern life -- from the early colonial era to the Civil War. But museums and popular histories rarely give this fact the prominence it deserves.</p>

        <p>Retrospective apologies can be a kind of psychopolitics that makes the apologizer feel good without doing anything concrete about the enduring consequences of past injustices. But the recent apologies by two Connecticut companies, Aetna and The Hartford Courant, have a singular virtue: They remind us of the usually glossed-over participation of the North in America's slave system.</p>
        <p>Yes, many college and even some high school textbooks make clear that slavery was embedded in every aspect of American life -- not just Southern life -- from the early colonial era to the Civil War. But museums and popular histories rarely give this fact the prominence it deserves.</p>
        <p>Aetna and The Courant were apologizing for profits their companies derived from insuring and advertising slaves in the 19th century. But the economic participation of the North in the slave trade and the use of slave labor went much deeper, even after Northern states no longer allowed slaveholding within their own borders.</p>
        <p>Nowhere did the connection go deeper than in New York City. How many New Yorkers today know that when the South seceded, Mayor Fernando Wood proposed that New York declare itself a free city, so as to be able to continue to profit from slavery, as it had from its beginnings?</p>
        <p>Slaves built New York -- and the rest of the country -- from their earliest arrival here at the beginning of the 1600's. In 1750, slaves represented more than 10 percent of the city's population; and in 1712 and 1741, New York was the site of slave conspiracies. Accounts of the city's rise to commercial prominence in the 19th century rightly point to the Erie Canal's role in opening access to produce from the West, but they don't talk about the equal importance to the city's prosperity of its control over the South's cotton trade. Because of this connection, New York merchants and bankers were consistently pro-slavery, pressing during the 1840's and 1850's for one concession to the South after another in order to maintain their lucrative access to cotton.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the North, too, textile factories relied on slave-grown cotton, shipping interests carried cotton to England, and banks and merchants financed cotton production.</p>
        <p>Some cities in Europe have begun to make a public display of their historical connection to slavery. In Liverpool, England's biggest slave-trading port, local museums candidly depict the role of slavery in the city's growth. Nantes, France, another city where much wealth derived from the slave trade, recently had a similar exhibition. New York should more candidly acknowledge that much of its early prosperity rested on slave labor.</p>
        <p>I am not proposing that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issue a retrospective apology. Far more valuable would be long-term projects to increase the city's historical self-consciousness. For example, when New York's history is taught in public schools, the city's intimate link with slavery should receive full attention. The city should have a permanent exhibition -- perhaps even an independent museum -- depicting the history of slavery and New York's connection with it.</p>
        <p>On the eve of the Civil War, the economic value of slaves in the United States was $3 billion in 1860 currency, more than the combined value of all the factories, railroads and banks in the country. Much of the North's economic prosperity derived from what Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, called ''the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil.'' Lincoln was asking Americans to consider the obligations created by slavery. The first of those obligations is to acknowledge the full truth.</p>
