        <p>An engineer who leveled charges of fraud in antimissile research against a big contractor is becoming caught in a federal clash.</p>
        <p>Pentagon agents are trying to question her about leaks of military secrets, even while Congressional and criminal investigators are gearing up to examine the merit of her accusations.</p>
        <p>Nira Schwartz, a senior engineer in 1995 and 1996 at TRW, a military contractor, has charged that the company falsified work that was  meant to help antimissile interceptors to distinguish incoming warheads from decoys.</p>
        <p>The company strongly denies the charge. Dr. Schwartz contends that TRW fired her when she protested.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dr. Schwartz objected to Pentagon plans to have security investigators question her about information she had provided to antimissile critics. She said the questioning was clearly aimed at shielding the $60 billion antimissile plan from scrutiny.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to kill the messenger,'' she said in an interview. ''Right now, the court case is the only way to bring this issue to justice. The nation needs an independent evaluation of the project. Otherwise, we're being taken for a ride.''</p>
        <p>Her case, which languished in federal court in Los Angeles for years, rose to prominence in recent months as the Clinton administration has pressed ahead with plans to deploy the antimissile system, and as scientists and critics have backed her charges and broadened them to contend that the Pentagon has tried to cover up the purported flaw.</p>
        <p>Her top scientific ally, Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who opposes the weapon, said Pentagon investigators were seeking to question Dr. Schwartz about declassified documents that she shared with him, apparently one in particular. They are doing so simply to harass her, he said.</p>
        <p>''This is outrageous,'' Dr. Postol said yesterday, adding that three Defense Security Service investigators confronted him over the same matter last month. ''It's very clear they know where the document comes from. This is a transparent case of intimidation.''</p>
        <p>Retroactively, Pentagon officials in May classified as secret a letter that Dr. Postol sent the White House and Dr. Schwartz's declassified document, which he included. That meant that the contents were taken out of circulation and treated as highly sensitive. Dr. Postol promptly denounced the Pentagon move as political censorship.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Dr. Postol said the Pentagon document in question had been declassified by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in the course of reviewing Dr. Schwartz's charges. He said the Pentagon was apparently going out of its way to avoid investigating itself.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday David W. Affeld, Dr. Schwartz's lawyer, wrote Lieut. Col. Bill Groves, the general counsel of the Pentagon's antimissile program, to complain about Defense Department plans to interrogate his client.</p>
        <p>''I am concerned,'' he wrote, ''that the 'investigation' of Dr. Schwartz is motivated not to preserve national security, but rather to intimidate an outspoken critic of the program'' as the White House considers whether to press ahead with the costly antimissile plan. Dr. Postol provided a copy of the letter. Mr. Affeld declined comment.</p>
        <p>Arthur L. Money, an assistant secretary of defense in charge of security policy, said last night that no decision had been made on whether to contact Dr. Schwartz. ''Our focus is internal to the Department of Defense on whether any leaks occurred,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Legal experts said that if Dr. Schwartz were found guilty of leaking military secrets, it might cripple or kill her lawsuit, especially if the finding ended her ability to review classified documents needed to prove her allegations.</p>
        <p>Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who has called for Congressional and criminal inquiries into Dr. Schwartz's charges, denounced the Pentagon's interrogation plan.</p>
        <p>''Obviously,'' he said yesterday, ''hits are being put out on anyone who betrays this high-tech code of silence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Markey and, separately, Representative Howard L. Berman and Senator Charles E. Grassley have called on the Congressional General Accounting Office to investigate the antimissile charges.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Robert E. Levin, a General Accounting Office official, said plans for an investigation were so far unfocused. ''We haven't really started interviewing witnesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Members of the House have asked the F.B.I. to investigate the fraud charges. John Collingwood, a bureau spokesman, said he could not comment on whether an inquiry was underway.</p>
