        <p>Overlooking Park Avenue on one of the choicest pieces of real estate in the city, the red brick Seventh Regiment Armory is considered both an architectural treasure and one of the country's leading showplaces for internationally renowned art, antiques and crafts exhibitions.</p>
        <p>But it is also viewed as a wasted opportunity, a long-neglected, badly deteriorated structure with crumbling ceilings and leaky walls, where space for which exhibition promoters clamor is rented out for a pittance.</p>
        <p>Seeking to reverse the armory's long decline and turn it into a money-making cultural center, the state yesterday invited nonprofit organizations and private companies to submit proposals for rehabilitating and operating the building, which occupies a full block between 66th and 67th Streets.</p>
        <p>City officials and civic leaders praised the state yesterday for recognizing the building's importance as a prime example of late Victorian architecture and design and coming up with sound criteria for restoring its grandeur.</p>
        <p>''This clearly establishes that the use has to be consistent with the historic character of the armory and respectful of one of our most important neighborhoods,'' said Kent Barwick, the president of the Municipal Art Society, referring to the state's request for proposals. Mr. Barwick is also a board member of the Seventh Regiment Armory Conservancy, a nonprofit group that is expected to bid for the armory contract.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm, said he expected several bidders to emerge. State officials said the Whitney Museum of American Art is interested in the site, but museum officials declined to confirm that yesterday.</p>
        <p>Kurt Masur, the music director of the New York Philharmonic, has said he would like to set up a summer home for the orchestra in the armory. ''I know that he is certainly interested,'' said a spokesman, Eric Latsky.</p>
        <p>And the Seventh Regiment Fund, a private organization that has been engaged in a protracted legal battle with the state over the ownership of the armory's multimillion-dollar collection of paintings and military regalia, is seeking to turn the armory into a military and decorative arts museum, said David L. Dalva II, an antiques dealer and the group's vice president.</p>
        <p>But to succeed, a bidder will have to have access to deep pockets. Mr. Gargano said it would cost an estimated $50 million to repair the armory. The structure was built with private funds between 1877 and 1881 as the headquarters of the socially prominent Seventh Regiment, which held social events to attract and maintain its elite volunteer membership. The armory's dozen ornate rooms, decorated by some of the nation's most prominent interior designers, are among the finest surviving examples of the American Esthetic Movement. Some of the interior was designed by the architect Stanford White and furnished by Louis Comfort Tiffany.</p>
        <p>In recent years, large sections of the armory have been unused, Mr. Gargano said, adding, ''Any building that's not fully used always has a tendency to deteriorate.''</p>
        <p>Before issuing the request for proposals, the state spent two years consulting with community and civic groups. But a housing shelter there remains a source of contention. Some community leaders said yesterday that they were disappointed that the state had not insisted on preserving the city shelter for homeless women that has occupied the third and fifth floors of the armory for about 15 years. The state said that prospective developers would not be required to accommodate the shelter, although they are not precluded from doing so.</p>
        <p>Nancy Wackstein, the executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, a nonprofit organization that operates the shelter for the city, said she had hoped that the state would encourage developers to retain the home, which currently houses 100 women who are 45 and older and is the only publicly financed homeless shelter on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>''We were hoping for more affirmative statements that the shelter can and should remain,'' Ms. Wackstein said. ''If it's displaced, there's no place else for it to go. This community, as every other community, has a responsibility to help address the homeless problem.''</p>
        <p>She said that at the very least, developers who plan to include a shelter should be given preference by the state.</p>
        <p>M. Barry Schneider, the chairman of Community Board 8, whose district includes the armory, said that keeping the shelter had been one of the community's overriding concerns during its meetings with state officials. ''They have not been a problem,'' Mr. Schneider said of the shelter, ''and they do good work. They ought to have been given a better deal.''</p>
        <p>City and state officials, however, said the shelter had wound up in the Armory only as an emergency measure and would need to be moved anyway while extensive renovations are made.</p>
        <p>Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the city's representative on the state's armory advisory council, said the city would help Ms. Wackstein to find another location if necessary.</p>
        <p>The deadline for submitting proposals to the state is Oct. 16. A short list of finalists will be announced on Jan. 15. State officials said they expected to choose a final bid by spring of next year.</p>
