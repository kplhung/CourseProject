        <p>Four banks that serve about one-third of bank customers in New York State have agreed to stop discouraging consumers from opening low-cost basic accounts, state officials said.</p>
        <p>The companies -- the Chase Manhattan Corporation, KeyCorp, the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company and HSBC Bank USA -- agreed in a settlement with the attorney general's office to follow a state law that requires them to provide the basic bank accounts.

        <p>Four banks that serve about one-third of bank customers in New York State have agreed to stop discouraging consumers from opening low-cost basic accounts, state officials said.</p>
        <p>The companies -- the Chase Manhattan Corporation, KeyCorp, the Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company and HSBC Bank USA -- agreed in a settlement with the attorney general's office to follow a state law that requires them to provide the basic bank accounts. They also agreed to spend $300,000 on a statewide advertising campaign to promote the low-cost accounts.</p>
        <p>The agreement came after a yearlong investigation by the attorney general's regional office in Syracuse. The investigation was started after a consumer complained that a Chase bank in Syracuse would not allow her to open a low-cost account. Under the informal agreement, the attorney general's office has agreed not to sue the companies if they comply with the law and undertake the consumer ad campaign.</p>
        <p>Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan, which banking officials say accounts for about 23 percent of the state's customers, said the company was ''happy to be doing this'' as a part of ''our ongoing efforts'' to inform consumers.</p>
        <p>Banks are required to offer low-cost accounts under a 1994 state law. Consumers could open such an account with a deposit of as little as $25. Account holders must maintain a minimum monthly balance of 1 cent, and they are charged a monthly maintenance fee of no more than $3. The accounts allow for eight free withdrawals each month and third-party check cashing at no cost to the consumer.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said yesterday that ''access to low-cost accounts is a right of all New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>He said that the people who suffered most from unavailability of the low-cost accounts were the poor and the elderly, who often have to rely on check-cashing services that charge a percentage of the check total as a fee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said his investigators found ''industrywide noncompliance'' with the law on low-cost bank accounts and would soon begin discussions with other institutions.</p>
        <p>Russ Haven, legislative counsel of the New York Public Interest Research Group, which lobbied for the 1994 law, praised the agreement, but said, ''The other part of this story is that the Banking Department has done an awful job enforcing the law and ensuring that the banks promote low-cost checking accounts.''</p>
        <p>State Banking Department officials disputed that assertion. An official said there were about one million basic accounts in the state.</p>
