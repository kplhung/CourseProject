        <p>AL GORE</p>
        <p>Speaking yesterday to delegates at the N.A.A.C.P. annual convention in Baltimore:</p>
        <p>''  W. E. B. Du Bois described the N.A.A.C.P.'s mission this way: ''the discovering and redress of cases of injustice.'' The N.A.A.C.P. has always championed the people, not the powerful; the weak and the weary, not the well off and the well connected.</p>
        <p>So to you, and to those who can hear my voice, I want to say it as plainly as I can: I'm running for president because I want to fight for you. I want to help those who have not had their fair share of justice, opportunity, equality and the American dream. We've got to move forward together. I want to serve the people, not the powerful. I want to take on the special interests on behalf of working families. I don't want to work for those who make excuses for the way things are instead of striving for the way things are supposed to be. . . .</p>
        <p>I want to offer you some specifics. I believe that it is time to invest in people. I pledge to you that I will bring about, as president, with your help, a continuation of the economic plan that has been good for our people. I don't want to go back to the giant deficits that are caused by focusing on massive tax cuts for the wealthy. I want tax cuts that are targeted to the people who need them, that are affordable, that are focused on education and health care and child care and raising children and strengthening families.</p>
        <p>I believe we need more Empowerment Zones, so that we can lift up the communities that have not shared in this prosperity yet. Alvin Brown, my executive director of the Empowerment Zone program, has worked with me all over this country. And we have brought jobs to the places where they are most needed.</p>
        <p>I want a specific program to clean up contaminated brownfields, good properties in good locations that need to be cleaned up and used to attract new jobs.</p>
        <p>Now let me tell you why they're not being cleaned up. I'm going to go and visit one here in the Baltimore area that the local leadership has tried mightily to get to turn into a magnet for opportunity and hope. There is national legislation pending right now that would do that, and the Democrats support it, and many moderate Republicans support it.</p>
        <p>Certainly people around the country support it. Why isn't it passing?</p>
        <p>Well, it is because there are powerful and wealthy special interests that have entered into a secret agreement that was made public, to the embarrassment of those who signed it, and the Republican leadership in the Senate pledged not to allow legislation to go forward that would clean up brownfields, because some of the big polluters in this country didn't want it to go forward and they secured a pledge that it would be tied to a special interest provision to help the polluters.</p>
        <p>Now, I believe that the bipartisan majority in the Congress that supports this, the bipartisan majority in the country that is overwhelmingly in favor of it, has a right to say to the Republican leadership and to the titular head of the Republican Party nationally: ''Put the people first. Let's pass this legislation and bring some jobs to the inner city. Let's don't just talk about it. Let's actually do it, by passing the legislation.'' But instead of passing legislation to revitalize our community, this Congress keeps blocking progress and trying to pass these massive giveaways to the powerful and the special interests.''</p>
