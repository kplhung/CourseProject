        <p>In 1995, the year before state education officials stepped in to overhaul the troubled Roosevelt school district on Long Island, just four graduating seniors received the respected Regents diplomas, symbolizing academic success in a host of subject areas.</p>
        <p>This year, after five years of the state's efforts, 6 students did so, out of a graduating class of 107.</p>
        <p>By almost any measure, the Roosevelt Free Union School District has barely improved and the state's attempt to turn it around is in disarray. The chairman of the state advisory panel that oversees the district resigned last month, the third change in the panel's leadership in five years. For months this spring, members of the state panel and the Roosevelt Board of Education were barely speaking to one another. The school district, meanwhile, has employed four superintendents in five years.</p>
        <p>Now, with one year remaining in the state's legislative mandate to set the district's 3,000 students on a path toward academic success, the effort is at a critical crossroads. Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, told the Roosevelt Board of Education this week that the district must show measurable progress this year in four areas -- local leadership, curriculum, financial stability and community support -- or face further state intervention. The district's students, he added, must meet specific targets on standardized tests in math and in English. Today, Mr. Mills will tell the Board of Regents what he plans to do if the district does not meet those goals.</p>
        <p>His options, however, appear to be limited. Simply ending state oversight without demonstrable academic progress would be an admission of failure at a time when Gov. George E. Pataki's administration is seeking to impose tougher learning standards on students throughout the state.</p>
        <p>And the district itself is confronting severe budget constraints, brought on by voters who rejected a construction bond issue and defeated proposed tax increases that would have raised school spending.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several members of the Board of Regents, including Chancellor Carl T. Hayden, oppose a direct takeover of Roosevelt's operations. A more severe option would be to revoke the registration of the Roosevelt middle and high schools and disperse its students. But people on all sides of the debate over Roosevelt schools say that option could be too politically charged to carry out, given that the district's students, who are overwhelmingly black and Hispanic, would have to be transferred to schools that are far more affluent and largely white.</p>
        <p>And the state has a significant investment beyond the district, as it tackles problems at 104 other failing schools, 97 of them in New York City. Critics of state supervision point to the lack of progress at Roosevelt, and ask whether the state's floundering role there indicates deeper flaws in the state's program for imposing tough standards on failing schools statewide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills said in an interview that Roosevelt's elementary schools had improved in recent years, and that the district had made progress in renovating crumbling buildings. But in the middle and high schools, continual turnover in teachers and administrators combined with the instability in the district's leadership have made any sustained progress all but impossible, he said.</p>
        <p>In Roosevelt, news of Mr. Mills's mandates for this year -- and the implied threat of more severe action next year -- raised hackles among some residents at a Board of Education meeting on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>''Now that they've made a mess of things, they're trying to put the onus on our board of education,'' said Serretta C. McKnight, who was president of the school board that was removed by the State Education Department in 1996. ''They want us to do lickety-split what they haven't done in five years.''</p>
        <p>Since 1990, the Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School, a combined school that the state wants to split up, has been listed as underperforming, with low test scores and low graduation rates. In March 1995, a state panel issued a harshly critical review, leading the State Legislature to grant Governor Pataki's request for intervention.</p>
        <p>While the legislation authorized the removal of the school board, a move the state took in early 1996, it left long-term governance to a new school board, elected a few months later. Since then, the state's power has been limited to advising the new board on recommended reforms.</p>
        <p>The state has also provided financial support, including legislative approval of an advance of $4 million in each of the last several years when the district essentially ran out of money before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Better fiscal management is one of the state's goals for the district this year, Mr. Mills said. Entwined with that, he added, is the need to improve relations between the district and local residents, who have voted down school budget increases in each of the last two years. Last month, voters also defeated a $70 million school construction bond issue.</p>
        <p>Because of those votes the district, which is in southern Nassau County, faces a second straight year of a so-called austerity budget, which limits any spending increase to the level of inflation. Meanwhile, a charter school is scheduled to open in the fall, which will take $1.7 million out of the district's $35 million budget. In a school district with high poverty rates and virtually no commercial tax base, paying for the school system is a continuing problem.</p>
        <p>''The people who live here are overassessed and overtaxed,'' said Francis Cooper, a Roosevelt resident who regularly attends school board meetings. ''But the state, in coming to Roosevelt, didn't bring any financial resources to the table. They gave us a loan of $4 million, which actually puts us further in the hole.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills contends, however, that the district has harmed itself, in part by not applying for grants and other state money for which the district is eligible.</p>
        <p>Mark Davis, who was elected president of the Roosevelt school board on Tuesday, said the board had begun to formulate plans to achieve the commissioner's goals, including his directive to hire chairmen for its math and English departments. In addition, a recently approved teachers' contract raises pay scales and should reduce teacher turnover. While Roosevelt's per pupil spending and teacher salaries are above the state average, they have been below that of nearby districts.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Davis said the state had failed to provide the financial resources necessary to allow the district to hire the administrators it needed to accomplish the changes the state wanted.</p>
        <p>''The board is not short of plans to improve the district; we're short of people to execute the plans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On all sides, participants have pointed fingers at others who they say are to blame for the district's problems. Michael Mostow, who retired as superintendent last month after losing the support of the board, said the State Education Department contained mainly theorists who did not have the skills to help a district with day-to-day operations.</p>
        <p>Ken Stubbolo, who resigned last month as a member of the state advisory board, said the Roosevelt Board of Education thwarted the efforts of the state advisers, who were in turn hamstrung by the Legislature's failure to give the oversight panel any operational responsibility.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of blame to go around, said the Rev. Reginald Tuggle, pastor of Memorial Presbyterian Church in Roosevelt, who once worked with the state panel and who is now on the board of the recently approved charter school.</p>
        <p>''There has been an absence of constructive parental and community involvement,'' he said. ''I know everybody means well -- the state, the school board and the administration. But this is a small school district. I don't know why they can't pull this together. It's hurting our children.''</p>
