        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Cameras and Microphones Turn a House (All of It) Into a Fishbowl'' (July 6) did a terrific job of describing an insider's view of the technology behind the ''Big Brother'' television show. The first paragraph, about how George Orwell expected the Soviets to perfect the Big Brother concept but it took capitalism to figure out how to do it really well, was outstanding. I read it aloud to the members of my car pool today between Austin, Minn., and Rochester, Minn. Unfortunately, I don't think they know who Orwell is.</p>
