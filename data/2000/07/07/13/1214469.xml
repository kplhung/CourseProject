        <p>Retro is in, and Wurlitzer jukeboxes are as retro as it gets. Now, in a partnership with a new company called Fun e-Business Inc., the Wurlitzer Jukebox Company of Gurnee, Ill., will soon produce a Web-based jukebox.</p>
        <p>The boxes will retain their 50's look but will be wired with high-speed Internet connections. Instead of the usual 1,200 or so songs found on most CD-based jukeboxes, the Wurlitzer Fun e-Jukeboxes, as they are called, will have access to any of the 469,000 songs from independent artists contained on the MP3.com Web site, and another 70,000 licensed songs of the Top 20 variety. Three songs can be played for $1.</p>

        <p>Ed Bevilacqua, chief executive of Fun e-Business, which is based in San Diego, Calif., said the e-Jukeboxes will sell for $5,000, or lease for $150 per month. Mr. Bevilacqua said that distribution of the boxes would begin later this summer and that he hoped to sell or lease some 20,000 of them in the next three years.</p>
        <p>And what of the 250,000 jukeboxes already up and running in restaurants and bars around the United States? They're collector's items, Mr. Bevilacqua said.</p>
