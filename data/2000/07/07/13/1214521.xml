        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
        <p>Camp is AWESOME!!! There's this really cool girl named Stephanie in my cabin, and guess what -- she has a really, REALLY cool idea for a Web site. We're going to call it lettersfromcampers.com, and we're going to offer consulting services for kids writing letters from camp on a paid subscription basis and make TONS of money.</p>

        <p>Camp is AWESOME!!! There's this really cool girl named Stephanie in my cabin, and guess what -- she has a really, REALLY cool idea for a Web site.

        <p>Pet Pumpkin for me!!!</p>
        <p>Love, Amy</p>
        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
        <p>It rained all day today, but that was O.K. with me and Stephanie, because we were meeting with our money people. Our first round of financing went really, REALLY well -- we raised $15 million!!! That's, like, 10 million weeks' allowance!!! We're thinking of adding an e-commerce component -- bug spray, duffel bags, etc.</p>
        <p>Tell Pumpkin I'm going to be really, REALLY rich!!!</p>
        <p>Love, Amy</p>
        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
        <p>Today while we were playing Capture the Flag, Stephanie brought along her Palm VII to check our stock price after the I.P.O., and we closed at $178 a share. My counselor, Sherrie, said it was the biggest opening-day pop in the ENTIRE cabin!</p>
        <p>Say hi to the dog.</p>
        <p>Love, Amy</p>
        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
        <p>Our money people are REALLY mean!!! They said we weren't turning a profit and probably never would! Stephanie told them we were delivering eyeballs, but they were like, eyeballs are a dime a dozen. And we were like, SOR-RY!!!</p>
        <p>Got to go. We're trying to get some second-round financing from the Philippines. Hi dog.</p>
        <p>Love, Amy</p>
        <p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
        <p>Our stock went down to 45 cents,  and Stephanie and I had to go into Chapter 11 and fire everyone in the cabin. It is SO UNFAIR!!! Our money people wouldn't even let us TELL them about the Super Bowl ads we came up with!</p>
        <p>I hate, hate, HATE camp!!! I miss, miss, MISS Pumpkin!!!  PLEASE TAKE ME HOME!!!!</p>
        <p>Love, Amy</p>
