        <p>AIRPORTS require certain survival skills under any circumstances, what with summer crowds, delayed flights, overpriced and stale food, lost baggage, overhead bins crammed with holiday loot and the dreaded 300-pound, perspiring tourist with a duffle bag heading for the center seat next to you.</p>
        <p>But add your laptop computer to the mix, and things can become complicated. So if you must carry a computer with you, here are some tips for how to get through airports a little more smoothly.</p>
        <p>HOLD ON TO IT -- To start with the obvious, but most important, rule: Never, ever, check your laptop computer as baggage. Have you ever watched the crews loading and unloading baggage? They often compete to see who can throw the bag the farthest. If your laptop is not mangled, it will be stolen. Maybe not on this trip, but eventually.</p>
        <p>INSURE IT -- If you use your laptop primarily for business, it is probably not covered under your standard homeowner's insurance policy. Your agent can add a laptop to your policy to cover the loss of hardware. Safeware (www.safeware.com) is an insurance company specializing in the coverage of laptops. One popular policy covers up to $3,000 of the replacement cost of a lost, stolen or damaged computer for $75 per year. And best of all, said David Haase of Safeware, ''there is no stupidity exclusion.''</p>
        <p>In other words, if you are dumb enough to put the laptop in your checked baggage or drop it off the side of a cruise ship, it's still covered.</p>
        <p>BE PREPARED -- Before you take your laptop to the airport, try destructive visualization: Somebody steals your laptop. Do you have a current backup copy of your data? Have you encrypted sensitive information?</p>
        <p>Laptop thefts are rampant in airports. Some of the thefts are opportunistic, occurring when the traveler leaves the computer unattended for one reason or another. It takes just a second or two, and the laptop has a new owner. Why is it that people who would never leave a purse or wallet unattended while they visit the restroom still occasionally leave their $2,000 laptops up for grabs?</p>
        <p>But some thefts are orchestrated. One of the more common scams involves a pair of grifters who select the victim at the security checkpoint where bags are placed on a conveyor belt to be X-rayed. The bag man (or woman) goes through first and loiters at the end of the conveyor.</p>
        <p>The second thief waits for the victim to send a laptop through the X-ray machine, then causes a distraction while passing through the metal detector. The owner of the laptop is delayed on the other side of the checkpoint long enough for the first thief to snatch the computer bag and disappear into the crowds.</p>
        <p>To reduce the chance of theft by conveyor-belt thieves, you may want to ask the security guard to hand-check your laptop, unless you are late for a flight. (By the way, the X-ray machine will not harm the data on your hard drive or floppies.) Of course, a hand-check means that you will have to appease the guard by turning on the computer to prove that it is not a bomb. If you use slow-booting Windows, allow extra minutes to get to your gate.</p>
        <p>According to Safeware, more than 300,000 laptops were reported stolen last year.</p>
        <p>DON'T FORGET IT -- Some otherwise sharp travelers simply leave their laptops on the plane. You can help a Good Samaritan return your computer by taping a business card to the bottom of it, engraving your driver's license number (not your Social Security number, which could be used to steal from your online accounts) on the top of the case or having contact information pop up when the computer is first turned on.</p>
        <p>DON'T BE OBVIOUS -- Many people carry their laptops in a carrying case labeled ''Dell,'' ''I.B.M.'' or some other obvious computer name. The bag might as well say ''Steal Me.'' My bag preference is a padded backpack. It is slightly less conspicuous and is also easier on the shoulders.</p>
        <p>LOOK FOR WIRELESS -- And now, some good news. There are few things more pathetic than the sight of a grown man sitting on the floor of the airport waiting room beneath a pay phone with a phone wire stretched between the modem and the phone, the laptop teetering on his knee, as he tries to send a file on deadline. Yes, I was that man.</p>
        <p>Wayport Inc. (www.wayport.com) has just completed unwiring the airport that serves Silicon Gulch in Austin, Tex., to allow travelers to get high-speed Internet access via wireless networking anywhere from the gate to the baggage claim area. Just relax in a comfortable place anywhere in the airport, pop open the notebook, log on to the Wayport portal, and say goodbye to squatting under the pay phones for an Internet connection.</p>
        <p>Two terminals at Dallas-Fort Worth will go wireless next week. Wayport says LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports will be wireless by the end of the year, along with Seattle-Tacoma and others. Wayport has set up its wireless networks in some 600 hotels and plans to more than double its base next year.</p>
        <p>The Wayport system is based on the 11-megabit IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet standard used by Apple, I.B.M., 3Com, Cisco and others. It requires a wireless networking card, about $99 to $179 in most stores, and costs a flat fee of $3.50 each time the traveler logs on to the network, although there is no time limit for the connection. Wayport has waived the connection fees for the first 50 times the traveler connects.</p>
        <p>BYO MOVIES -- On longer flights, some airlines show movies that you probably did not want to see when they were at the theaters. Some offer passengers a portable DVD or Hi-8 video player with a dinky screen and bad sound. But if your laptop has a DVD drive, simply rent or buy your choice of DVD movies before the trip and enjoy them on the big screen. Make sure that you have sufficient battery life, though. Your seat neighbors will stare in awe as you fire up ''The Matrix'' on your 15-inch TFT screen.</p>
        <p>If you are planning ahead, NEC has just released in Japan the first laptop with Dolby Headphone, a new sound technology that recreates the 5.1-channel surround-sound effects of a home theater system through a pair of ordinary stereo headphones. The Dolby Headphone technology is expected to be available in the United States by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>SKIP THE TRAYS -- Some airlines are adding an inch or two of space between rows in coach, which is welcome, but they have not done anything to make it easier to use a laptop on the little trays that fold down from the back of the seat in front of you. Grab an extra pillow or blanket from the flight attendant and here's a novel idea: use the laptop on your lap. If the lout in front of you suddenly lurches backward, your computer will not be harmed.</p>
        <p>AND SKIP THE BINS -- It is a good idea to store the computer under the seat in front of you rather than in an overhead bin. I saw a laptop fall to its death recently when a passenger decided to rearrange the overhead compartment to make room for her oversize bag, and ---- oops! Her seatmate's computer bag fell five feet to the floor. Luckily, it did not land on someone's head. Also, a bag at your feet is harder to forget than a bag in the overhead bin, and no one is trying to jam a suitcase against your bag down there.</p>
        <p>FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS -- Does your portable electronic device really interfere with sensitive avionics on the aircraft, jeopardizing everyone's safety during takeoffs and landings? The evidence is inconclusive. But if the pilot is happier with devices turned off, you should be happy, too.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you'd like to ignore all these tips, you could ask yourself a fundamental question before you start out on your trip:</p>
        <p>Do I really need to take a computer with me on vacation?</p>
