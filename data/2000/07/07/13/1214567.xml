        <p>Maybe it is because he lives in Manhattan and is a native of Stamford, Conn., two places now teeming with fiberglass cows as part of a summer-long art exhibit. For whatever reason, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine went bovine when analyzing his team's standing at the All-Star break.</p>
        <p>''I don't look and say, 'Hey, would you like to be 5 over, 10 over? First place, third place?' That stuff doesn't mean anything to me,'' Valentine said. ''How much pasture do you have left for the cows to feed on and are they nurtured properly, so that by the time they go to slaughter, you've got the price per pound that you need. That's what this is all about, I think.</p>
        <p>''If you think you're fat enough at the All-Star break, then you've got to start the slaughter. If all the grass is eaten, you can't do any more nurturing, can't do any more building, then we might as well buy some more property. I think our group is O.K. We're not a finished product.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' first half, in which they went 48-38 to stand three games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East, was characterized by apparent peace between Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips. After Phillips considered firing Valentine during the April flap sparked by the manager's talk at the Wharton School of Business, the two have made nice. If they have significantly clashed since then, they have not done so in public.</p>
        <p>Valentine seems to want reinforcements, and Phillips is trying to deliver them before the July 31 trading deadline. He has a track record. Since 1997, Phillips has acquired Turk Wendell, Mel Rojas, Brian McRae, Willie Blair, Greg McMichael, Tony Phillips, Darryl Hamilton, Kenny Rogers, Shawon Dunston, Chuck McElroy and Billy Taylor before or just after the deadline.</p>
        <p>''You always look to improve your team if you can, even if it's only by one game,'' Phillips said. ''We learned last year how important one game can be. We always try to do something at the trading deadline anyway, so I anticipate this year won't be any different.''</p>
        <p>The Mets could use a bit of everything, but beyond pitchers Grant Roberts and Pat Strange and outfielder Alex Escobar, they may not have the depth in elite prospects to make a major move comparable to the Yankees' trade for Denny Neagle. And one more pitcher was taken off the market when Andy Ashby was traded to the Braves.</p>
        <p>The Mets' rotation is solid, but adding a third top starter to join Mike Hampton and Al Leiter could make a big difference in a playoff series. They have virtually the same bullpen that was so successful last year, but this year's inconsistency makes relief help a pressing need.</p>
        <p>By the end of May, the Mets had lost three starting position players -- Hamilton and Rey Ordonez were injured and Rickey Henderson was released -- and they have filled all three spots from within. Benny Agbayani and Jay Payton are regulars in the outfield and Melvin Mora is the everyday shortstop and leadoff hitter.</p>
        <p>The replacements have been impressive, but although Payton has always been projected as an everyday player, Agbayani and Mora were not in the Mets' longterm plans as starters.</p>
        <p>Phillips has been supportive of them but has not sounded convinced, and he will try to add either bench help or possibly a starting outfielder.</p>
        <p>''I'm not surprised that we have the depth to do it,'' Phillips said of covering the lineup's losses from within. ''But I think it's something that, with bench players or role players, you have to be sure that they're capable of getting the job done. So far, they've shown that they have.''</p>
        <p>But with that has come a decline in the productivity of the bench. Lenny Harris and Mark Johnson are a combined 5 for 38 this year, and the other left-handed pinch-hitter, Matt Franco, is batting .237. Infielder Kurt Abbott seemed to be coming around but was bothered by back problems that have landed him on the disabled list. David Lamb, a .230 hitter for Class AAA Norfolk, was his replacement.</p>
        <p>''I think considering those factors, we're still pretty deep,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>But the Mets are not deep enough to give their starters significant rest; Robin Ventura has sat out only two games, Edgardo Alfonzo, Derek Bell and Todd Zeile just three. The All-Star break came at a good time, and not only because the Mets face Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox tonight as they begin an 11-game trip that continues to Toronto, Montreal and Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza has been resting from the concussion he suffered when Roger Clemens beaned him on Saturday, and he is expected to be in the lineup tonight. The other starting players also needed time off.</p>
        <p>''It's coming at a time when we could use a break,'' Zeile said after the Mets beat the Yankees last Sunday for the only time in their four-game series. ''Guys have played a lot of games and a lot of innings.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets signed 26-year-old right-hander OSCAR HENRIQUEZ and 31-year-old right-hander WILLIE BANKS and assigned them to Class AAA Norfolk. Henriquez led Norfolk with 23 saves last year, but was upset at not being called up to the Mets and signed with San Diego last winter. Battling shoulder problems, he was throwing in the mid-80's and failed to make the Padres this spring. But he signed with a team in the Mexican League and threw much better, and he will pitch in late-inning relief for Norfolk. Henriquez has been held back by a poor work ethic, leading to weight problems. But Henriquez is married now and will soon become a father. ''He has all the God-given talent,'' Henriquez's agent, PETER GREENBERG, said. ''He now has some reason to be responsible.'' Banks, a former Yankee and a standout at St. Anthony in Jersey City, last pitched in the majors for Arizona in 1998 and has spent the last two seasons with the Orix Blue Wave in Japan. He was 0-5 when the Blue Wave released him June 29.</p>
