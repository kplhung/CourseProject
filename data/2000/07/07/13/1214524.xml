        <p>The publication by an Albanian-language newspaper of the name and photograph of a Serb accused by the daily of crimes against Albanians, and his  murder soon after, has stirred passionate debate about press freedom and the need to stop revenge killings in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>After the murder, the United Nations administration that rules Kosovo shut down the newspaper, Dita, for eight days. Then, when Dita reappeared and promptly reprinted the offending article, international officials sought to impose a formal code of conduct on the news media here.</p>
        <p>But local Albanian journalists and international news media watch-dog bodies have protested the attempts to regulate media so strongly that the United Nations administration is likely to abandon the code, a senior United Nations official says.</p>
        <p>A law that provides for the fining, suspension or closing of print or broadcast media will, however, remain on the books, the official said. The regulation, signed by the United Nations chief here, Bernard Kouchner, is intended to prevent the publication or broadcasting of personal details about people who might become targets of Albanian or Serbian vigilantes.</p>
        <p>The frustration of the United Nations authorities is evident as interethnic attacks continue, especially on the Serbian minority in Kosovo, while a system of international judges to deal with such crimes is just beginning to function.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kouchner issued the regulation after Dita published an article on April 27 accusing two Serbs, Petar Topoljski and his father, of being members of paramilitary groups. Petar Topoljski, 25, still lived in Kosovo and worked as a translator for the United Nations; the paper published his address and photograph.  Three weeks later he was found murdered, stabbed with a wire wound around his neck.</p>
        <p>His death seemed an example of the press feeding the cycle of vengeance against Serbs, with no recourse to the police or the courts. While there could be no direct connection drawn between the Dita article and the murder, Mr. Kouchner decided to act, judging that news media self-regulation was not working, and closed Dita for eight days.</p>
        <p>More moderate Albanian newspapers, like Koha Ditore, criticized the suspension of Dita as an arbitrary act of personal power. Dita's publisher, Behlul Beqaj, justified publication of the information by saying that the system of justice in Kosovo was not working, and that there had been no punishment for people accused of war crimes.</p>
        <p>As soon as the suspension was over, Mr. Beqaj republished the article. Mr. Kouchner then issued his regulation on June 17 covering broadcast and print media, naming a temporary news media commissioner with the power to impose sanctions, fine offending media up to $50,000, seize equipment or material and suspend or shut down an outlet.</p>
        <p>Appeals are subject to a board appointed by Mr. Kouchner.</p>
        <p>The commissioner, a former American diplomat, Douglas Davidson, was also given power to issue temporary codes of conduct to be compiled in consultation with local editors and imposed ''in special circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson defended the codes as common in Europe and necessary to deter ''hate speech.'' But the United Nations is likely to abandon the effort to compile a code, after what officials describe as long and frustrating meetings with editors who oppose it as undemocratic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kouchner's regulation itself caused a furor. It was condemned by the World Press Freedom Committee and other international news media watch-dogs, and Mr. Beqaj tested it on June 26, publishing the names of two Serbs from the town of Kosovo Polje accused of attacking ethnic Albanians. One of those Serbs is in close contact with the municipality and the United Nations. This time, Dita went to the police first, but did not heed United Nations requests to delay publication.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson then issued a warning to Dita and said the paper appeared to have violated the regulation on publishing personal details that ''would pose a serious threat to the life, safety or security of any such person through vigilante violence or otherwise.''</p>
        <p>''Publishing names can put people's lives at risk,'' Mr. Davidson said in a statement. ''It is also violating a fundamental principle of Western journalism that someone is innocent until proven guilty.''</p>
        <p>Then, on July 5, Dita published the names, prewar addresses and photographs of 15 more Serbs it accused of committing crimes against ethnic Albanians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beqaj is unrepentant. In one meeting with Mr. Davidson and other editors, he noted that Dita was accused of involvement with just one death out of 500 or so that have occurred in Kosovo in the year since NATO troops arrived.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davidson, Mr. Kouchner and other United Nations officials say they must have some way to stop hate speech and the incitement to murder individuals on the basis of uncorroborated accusations by news media. ''This is not yet a normal place,'' Mr. Davidson said. ''The international community must have some control and if it wants to lower the level of hatred and tension here, not make it worse, then one thing you must look at is the media.''</p>
        <p>But Baton Haxhiu, the editor of Koha Ditore, said that Albanian news executives are able to police themselves, and that the solution lies not in restricting press freedom, but in providing a functioning justice system. ''All this just shows that the internationals are becoming Balkanized, trying to put restrictions on the freedom of the press,'' he said. ''This is a bad precedent, and it will be used against us by some political party in the future.''</p>
