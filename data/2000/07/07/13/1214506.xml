        <p>John McEnroe's star turn as the United States Davis Cup captain is not exactly unfolding the way he envisioned. In the space of two days, the capricious forces of injury and accident have deprived McEnroe of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi for the Davis Cup semifinal against Spain July 21-23 in Santander, Spain. Instead, the first-year captain will take a team anchored by Todd Martin and including Jan-Michael Gambill and Chris Woodruff.</p>
        <p>McEnroe has also turned, at least temporarily, to one player he knows he can depend on: himself.</p>
        <p>As player-captain of the United States team, McEnroe, 41, could play doubles -- and, he insists, doubles only -- against Spain, unless he can find someone younger, stronger and willing (perhaps Paul Goldstein or Vince Spadea). McEnroe can substitute any of his four players up to 10 minutes before the July 20 draw for the semifinal, which will be played on slow, red clay.</p>
        <p>''I haven't actually decided to compete,'' McEnroe said yesterday in a conference call announcing the United States team. ''There is a good chance I won't play, but there is a chance I will play, and if I take the court, I'm not going out there to lose. Until yesterday, it wasn't even something I was thinking about.</p>
        <p>''You know, I'm not in this to play,'' said McEnroe, who has a 59-10 record in singles and doubles and five Davis Cup championships in 12 years playing for the United States. ''My plan is to work with younger players and make them better, not for me necessarily to take a spot from someone. The situation is that there's not a lot of guys that have gotten themselves into a position where they should be playing.''</p>
        <p>And those who are in a position to play are bowing out. On Tuesday, Sampras confirmed that the acute tendinitis in his left shin that had plagued him throughout a successful run to his seventh Wimbledon championship and a record 13th Grand Slam singles title would keep him out of the matchup against Spain. Following doctors' advice, Sampras will rest for two to three weeks.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how injured he is,'' McEnroe said yesterday. ''There's no way of me knowing that. Davis Cup was something that was a priority to me. But, who am I to say? I wish he had made an effort to do it, and perhaps played a doubles match and been there; that might have been inspiring.</p>
        <p>''Who knows, maybe he'd be risking further injury if he played right now.''</p>
        <p>While Sampras's withdrawal was not a surprise, Agassi's pullout stunned McEnroe. Agassi, driving from the airport to his Las Vegas home, strained his back when his car was rear-ended in a minor automobile accident Sunday night.</p>
        <p>''That was obviously more shocking because it came out of the blue,'' McEnroe said. ''We as a team, and myself as a captain, have been banking on him to win a couple matches. To say that I was disappointed would be a major understatement.''</p>
        <p>Even with Sampras and Agassi, the United States faced an imposing challenge against Spain. The 20-year-old Juan Carlos Ferrero is ''one of the best clay-court players in the world, bar none,'' McEnroe said, and No. 7 Alex Corretja and No. 22 Albert Costa are also outstanding clay-courters. Now, McEnroe rated his team's chances at ''probably 10-20 percent.''</p>
        <p>The Americans will be led into a 10,500-seat temporary stadium in Santander by the game but gimpy Martin, who has competed in only seven tournaments in 2000 after sustaining a knee injury early in the season. Gambill, at No. 30, is the highest-ranked player on the American team. A fit, strong but largely untested 23-year-old, he reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals (losing to Sampras) and was 1-1 in limited Davis Cup duty in 1998. Woodruff won the fifth and deciding match against Zimbabwe in the first round.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, McEnroe sounded both deflated and defiant while discussing his captaincy.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I haven't been that successful in getting the players,'' McEnroe said. ''Todd was injured. the first couple. Pete was unavailable for the first match. Now Pete and Andre. Chang has said no both times that I've asked him to play,'' he said of Michael Chang. Jim Courier has recently retired. This has certainly not turned out the way it was planned beforehand, at least in my mind.</p>
        <p>''I was hoping that my presence there would make a real difference. At this point, you either call it bad luck or it hasn't made a difference.''</p>
