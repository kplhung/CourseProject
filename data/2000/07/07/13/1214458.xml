        <p>THE Theodore Presser Company started publishing sheet music in 1783. This week it will start to publish sheet music in a different form, as PDF files on CD-ROM disks.</p>
        <p>The company has teamed up with a CD-ROM company called CD Sheet Music to put thousands of pages of classical scores in digital form. The first 15 CD-ROM's -- which include the complete piano solos of Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mozart, Schumann and many others -- are showing up in music stores this week.</p>
        <p>By the end of 2002, the company plans to sell a series of 110 disks. Most of the disks will sell for about $15 each.</p>
        <p>''What we are talking about is something akin to the world's greatest music library,'' said Tom Broido, president of Theodore Presser. ''We're giving people the opportunity to have it in their own home.''</p>
        <p>Each CD-ROM includes Adobe Acrobat software that enables people to view the sheet music on their computer screens and print it out on 8 1/2-by-11 paper without reformatting. It also enables searching and browsing by a composer's name or a score's title. The software can be used on either Windows or Macintosh computers.</p>
        <p>Sheet music is offered online by other companies. Sheet Music Online (www.sheetmusic1.com) and Music-Scores.com (www.music-scores .com) offer sheet music that can be viewed on Web pages and printed at no cost.</p>
        <p>But searching through the archives on free music sites can sometimes be cumbersome, and finding rare works is unlikely. Those are two problems that the Theodore Presser Company hopes to rectify with its CD-ROM's, which use a simple interface that lets users click on titles in a table of contents and immediately view the music in printable form.</p>
        <p>Mr. Broido said that the company was also intent on making its disks as inexpensive as possible, which is why they include nothing but black-and-white sheet music. They do not include any sound files or interactive graphics.</p>
        <p>They do, however, allow users to print as many sheets as they want. Mr. Broido said he expected that piano teachers, for example, might buy the CD's and print sheet music for students to sample. As long as people are not reselling the printouts or making a business out of their use, Mr. Broido said, they are free to use them as they like.</p>
        <p>All the music is in the public domain, and Mr. Broido said that he was not concerned that people would bootleg the CD's, because buying a disk is probably less of a burden for most users than figuring out how to burn a new copy. ''The price of the product is its greatest protection,'' Mr. Broido said.</p>
        <p>The disks might also be seen as protection against overstuffed piano benches, since each package includes many volumes of scores. The CD-ROM titled ''Beethoven: The Complete Works of Solo Piano,'' for example, includes more than 1,500 pages of music. The disk featuring the complete keyboard sonatas of Haydn and Scarlatti includes more than 2,500 pages.</p>
        <p>The company's biggest one-disk collection is ''The Ultimate Collection of Piano Studies and Exercise,'' which features staples of piano practice like mind-numbing finger exercises.</p>
        <p>''This one is every pianist's worst nightmare,'' said Dwight Munroe, the advertising manager. ''It is over 3,000 pages.''</p>
