        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''After 12 Years in 'Exile' Tharp Shifts Gears Again'' (Arts pages, July 6), the career history of the choreographer Twyla Tharp is touched on in the context of her current plans to start her own company. It was disconcerting to see the project Tharp! mentioned as a ''pick-up group'' and for Ms. Tharp to be quoted as having been ''in exile'' for such a long period.</p>

        <p>In ''After 12 Years in 'Exile' Tharp Shifts Gears Again'' (Arts pages, July 6), the career history of the choreographer Twyla Tharp is touched on in the context of her current plans to start her own company. It was disconcerting to see the project Tharp! mentioned as a ''pick-up group'' and for Ms. Tharp to be quoted as having been ''in exile'' for such a long period.</p>
        <p>The original Tharp!, for which I was the project manager, was not a company per se. It was, however, a committed group of dancers, rehearsal directors, designers and technicians who dedicated themselves from 1995 to 1998 to perpetuating Ms. Tharp's creative vision.</p>
        <p>During that time, Ms. Tharp created six new works with this group, which were performed in repertory at more than 30 major festivals and theaters around the world. We certainly felt like a dance company.</p>
