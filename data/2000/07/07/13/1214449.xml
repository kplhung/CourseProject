        <p>ONE of the great pleasures of parenthood is designing a nursery and choosing a crib. But the first consideration in buying a crib should be safety, not looks. While it is tempting to use family heirlooms, antique or vintage cribs can present hazards, no matter how many generations have slept in them. Most do not meet the current government safety regulations that apply to crib manufacturers.</p>
        <p>When shopping for a new crib, it is important to look for drop sides that lock firmly and that a child cannot disengage. The bars on the side of the crib should not be more than two and three-eighths inches apart -- the width of a soda can. The mattress should fit snugly in place, with never more than a one-inch gap between it and the sides. A crib mattress should never be thicker than six inches. But the Consumer Reports Guide to Baby Products (1999) also advises against thin mattresses, because fitted sheets may not fit tightly enough and could present another hazard.</p>

        <p>ONE of the great pleasures of parenthood is designing a nursery and choosing a crib. But the first consideration in buying a crib should be safety, not looks. While it is tempting to use family heirlooms, antique or vintage cribs can present hazards, no matter how many generations have slept in them. Most do not meet the current government safety regulations that apply to crib manufacturers.</p>
        <p>When shopping for a new crib, it is important to look for drop sides that lock firmly and that a child cannot disengage. The bars on the side of the crib should not be more than two and three-eighths inches apart -- the width of a soda can. The mattress should fit snugly in place, with never more than a one-inch gap between it and the sides. A crib mattress should never be thicker than six inches. But the Consumer Reports Guide to Baby Products (1999) also advises against thin mattresses, because fitted sheets may not fit tightly enough and could present another hazard.</p>
        <p>Federal guidelines require that all crib paint be lead-free. In addition, all wood surfaces should be smooth. And note: because some cribs take months for delivery, shop early or buy a bassinet for use when the baby first comes home.</p>
        <p>1. The Heirloom poster crib, 30 inches wide by 54 inches long, made of iron and brass, is available in a choice of finishes; white, gold, gunmetal gray or custom colors. The crib is $1,200; the canopy frame is $250. An innerspring mattress is $175. The white embroidered and lace dust ruffle and canopy set is $625. Available from Pamela Scurry's Wicker Garden Baby, 1327 Madison Avenue (93rd Street).</p>
        <p>2. The Gulliver, 31 by 54 inches, is in white or natural wood; $99. A mattress is $30. From Ikea, (800) 434-4532 for orders or store locations.</p>
        <p>3. The Sleigh crib, 32 inches wide by 60 inches long, is available in white, antique white or natural maple. The side rails are removable and the crib becomes a youth bed or a settee (inset). It is $799 without a mattress from the Pottery Barn Kids catalog, (800) 430-7373.</p>
        <p>4. The Estate crib by Cosco is 32 by 55 inches. It is $129.99 (and an innerspring mattress is $29.99 or $49.99) at Kmart; (800) 866-0086 for store locations.</p>
        <p>5. The Classic, a 31-by-54-inch spindle-style crib, comes in white, oak or cherry and costs $262 without a mattress. A conversion kit will turn it into a toddler bed; available from www.babysupercenter.com, which offers more than 100 cribs, from $200 to $2,860 (for the round Hollywood line, including the Brocade/Faux Leopard and Mink/Metal crib) and up to $3,460 for the Royal Court Velvet round crib. Mattresses are from $67 to $130; (888) 554-2229.</p>
        <p>6. The Dura crib is a 45-inch round molded plastic design that is 75 inches high at the top of the canopy. It is $485 and comes with a three-inch-thick foam rubber mattress. The Gelato Rainbow Ice bedding set (shown) includes bumpers, a coverlet, dust ruffle, canopy and one fitted sheet, and costs $325. The crib and bedding can be ordered from www.babysupercenter.com.</p>
