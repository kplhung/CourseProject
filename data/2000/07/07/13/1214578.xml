        <p>Senate Republicans carped today at a proposal from one of their own, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare. But they praised him for making the effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is trying to narrow the gap between Democrats and Republicans on the issue in an election year. Under his proposal, the government would offer drug coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. But those who accepted the offer would have to pay more for some services, like home health care.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and Senate Democrats greeted Mr. Roth's proposal with some optimism. Conservative Republicans showed little enthusiasm for it but were circumspect in their comments. They said that they feared that the cost of prescription drug benefits would soar, and that Congress should not rush to pass legislation just to appease voters.</p>
        <p>Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican who is a member of the Finance Committee, expressed reservations about Mr. Roth's proposal, saying the costs to the government ''could explode on us overnight.''</p>
        <p>The campaign for Medicare drug benefits may look unstoppable, Mr. Gramm said in an interview, but he declared: ''The politics of this issue are not as sweet as Bill Clinton thinks. There is not going to be a major expansion of Medicare this year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gramm suggested that Congress simply give money to the states -- $20 billion over the next five years -- so they could help low-income people buy prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Gramm, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader, expressed concern about the long-term cost of the  Roth proposal. Many beneficiaries need drug coverage, he said, but Congress should not try to solve the problem by creating ''a big expensive program.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, clearly mindful of the issue's political appeal, seemed ready to let the Finance Committee work its will. Mr. Lott said the committee had ''a green light'' to write legislation offering drug benefits. Without endorsing the details of Mr. Roth's plan, he said he hoped the full Senate would address the issue this year.</p>
        <p>A bill passed last month by the House would give subsidies to insurance companies that provide Medicare drug benefits. Under Mr. Roth's proposal, in contrast, the government itself would administer the benefits and bear the financial risk.</p>
        <p>President Clinton welcomed the senator's proposal. ''I am pleased that there is growing momentum on Capitol Hill to provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit, not a flawed insurance model,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, went further, describing the proposal as ''a sharp repudiation of what the House Republicans proposed.''</p>
        <p>Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said Republicans ''appeared to be astounded'' at the Roth plan. ''It's unique,'' Mr. Breaux said. ''It has opposition from Democrats and Republicans both.''</p>
        <p>Some Republicans said they needed more details before they could comment on the proposal. They did not embrace or reject it, but said it might come in handy later this year if they saw a political imperative to address demands from elderly voters clamoring for relief from high drug costs.</p>
        <p>But Democratic senators said they worried that the proposal would not provide the low-income elderly  enough help in drug coverage.</p>
        <p>They said the government should spend more than the $40 billion over the next five years proposed by Mr. Roth. And they generally opposed his provision making Medicare beneficiaries who choose the drug benefits -- those who select his so-called high-option alternative -- pay 20 percent of the cost of home health care visits.</p>
        <p>Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said, ''I have a serious problem with forcing seniors who need prescription drugs to leave Medicare as we know it.''</p>
        <p>Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, expressed concern that under the proposal, people with very high drug costs would still have to pay a substantial share of them, perhaps 20 percent. By contrast, under many Democratic proposals, the government would pick up 100 percent of costs above some level, perhaps $4,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Despite these concerns, senators of both parties, including Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, welcomed Mr. Roth's effort. They said it could be a vehicle for further action if the Finance Committee proceeds to debate and vote on the issue later this month, as Mr. Roth wants.</p>
