        <p>For Indian playwrights, involvement in New York theater has been more a flirtation than anything serious. That has meant mostly short runs, small theaters and few mainstream audiences even for celebrated Indian playwrights.</p>
        <p>The growing Indian arts community here hopes to change this. Beginning on Friday, the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center is to host a Festival of Indian Theater, which will run for three weeks and include 18 performances.

        <p>For Indian playwrights, involvement in New York theater has been more a flirtation than anything serious. That has meant mostly short runs, small theaters and few mainstream audiences even for celebrated Indian playwrights.</p>
        <p>The growing Indian arts community here hopes to change this. Beginning on Friday, the TriBeCa Performing Arts Center is to host a Festival of Indian Theater, which will run for three weeks and include 18 performances. The festival is sponsored by the Indo-American Arts Council, whose director, Aroon Shivdasani, says it is the first such festival in North America.</p>
        <p>The festival will offer the United States premieres of two plays, in English with all-Indian casts, by two of India's leading playwrights.</p>
        <p>Mahesh Dattani's ''Dance Like a Man'' is about the conflict between two aging dancers of the classical temple style known as Bharata Natyam, whose careers are ending, and their daughter, whose career is taking off. It was written in English.</p>
        <p>Vijay Tendulkar's ''Once Upon A Fleeting Bird'' is an English adaptation of a contemporary love story set in Bombay. It was originally performed in the Marathi language.</p>
        <p>The Asia Society has organized a series of conversations with the playwrights, directors and casts before and after selected performances.</p>
        <p>''Indian theater has been shown here, but it has been a one-night stand,'' said Ms. Shivdasani, who  was a founder of the small, multicultural Bear Theater Company in Toronto. ''It's one night in Queens, one night in New Jersey, then it's out.''</p>
        <p>The Indian plays draw a niche audience, she said. That means that American playgoers miss out on playwrights who are as well-known in their home country as Arthur Miller is here.</p>
        <p>The Indo-American Arts Council was started two years ago to introduce mainstream American audiences to Indian artists. A film screening or performance is often  accompanied by a discussion about broader aspects of Indian culture. For information, call the box office at (212) -346-8510.</p>
