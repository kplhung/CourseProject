        <p>Three teams survive in the Greater New York Bridge Association's Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship, which began nine months ago. John Rengstorff, Adam Wildavsky, Jim Krekorian, Marty Fleisher, Chris Willenken and Jesus Arias are unbeaten. In the once-defeated bracket, teams headed by Willie Ehlers and Jon Greenspan face each other. The winner of that match would need to defeat Rengstorff twice to take the title.</p>
        <p>In the previous round, the defenders failed to solve a tricky defensive problem on the diagramed deal. North-South were using a nonstandard system in which an opening one-club bid is two-way: It may be strong and artificial, but more than half the time it shows, as in this case, a balanced hand with 9-11 points.</p>

        <p>Three teams survive in the Greater New York Bridge Association's Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship, which began nine months ago. John Rengstorff, Adam Wildavsky, Jim Krekorian, Marty Fleisher, Chris Willenken and Jesus Arias are unbeaten. In the once-defeated bracket, teams headed by Willie Ehlers and Jon Greenspan face each other. The winner of that match would need to defeat Rengstorff twice to take the title.</p>
        <p>In the previous round, the defenders failed to solve a tricky defensive problem on the diagramed deal. North-South were using a nonstandard system in which an opening one-club bid is two-way: It may be strong and artificial, but more than half the time it shows, as in this case, a balanced hand with 9-11 points.</p>
        <p>Ehlers was sitting South and became the declarer in four spades. The opening lead of the heart nine was covered by the jack, queen and ace. The declarer cashed the spade ace and chose to draw all the remaining trumps. East played nine-four in clubs and then discarded one heart and one diamond, leaving this position:</p>
        <p>South led the diamond nine, which was ducked to the jack. East cashed the club king and returned the heart eight, allowing South to win with the king in dummy and finesse the six to make his game.</p>
        <p>If East had done anything else after winning with the diamond jack he would have found himself squeezed. If he returns a diamond, he suffers that fate whether or not West takes his ace. If West ducks, South leads the remaining diamond from the dummy. The winning defense, not obvious, was for West to take his diamond ace in the diagramed position and lead a club.</p>
        <p>The Ehlers team nevertheless lost five imps, because in the replay North-South also brought home four spades, but this time doubled. South adopted a different plan. He led a club at the second trick and maneuvered to take two club ruffs in his hand, a dummy reversal.</p>
