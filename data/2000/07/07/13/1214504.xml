        <p>Every year at this time, fields and mountain slopes in Mount Crested Butte, Colo, explode into color with more than 1,000 varieties of wildflowers, and popularity of annual wildflower festival has reached a critical point; organizers, who expect 2500 participants this year, are grappling with thorny questions of how to manage growth while preserving the quality of educational programs and limiting damage to flowers themselves; photo (Mount Crested Butte Journal (M)</p>

        <p>Ever so slowly, the secret is getting out. This time of year, the fields and mountain slopes here explode into color, with more than 1,000 varieties of wildflowers poking through the grasslands in a dazzling crazy-quilt of brilliance.</p>
        <p>Residents always knew about the wildflowers, but not many others did until it occurred to a group of local leaders nearly 20 years ago that the flowers might be an ideal way to show off a town known almost exclusively as a ski resort.

        <p>Ever so slowly, the secret is getting out. This time of year, the fields and mountain slopes here explode into color, with more than 1,000 varieties of wildflowers poking through the grasslands in a dazzling crazy-quilt of brilliance.</p>
        <p>Residents always knew about the wildflowers, but not many others did until it occurred to a group of local leaders nearly 20 years ago that the flowers might be an ideal way to show off a town known almost exclusively as a ski resort. So they began the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival as a weekend of wildflower hikes led by experts who can tell a harebell from a fringed gentian and a sneezeweed from a little sunflower.</p>
        <p>''Back then,'' said Nan Buxton, a visitor from Oklahoma City who has attended the festival almost every year, ''you could just come down and sign up.''</p>
        <p>Now look: The festival has grown so big and popular that participants call weeks in advance to reserve space for nearly 150 hikes, workshops and evening programs that have turned the festival into a week-long event. In addition to nature walks, activities include classes on nature photography, medicinal plants, edible plants, organic gardens, insects, butterflies and ecosystems. Some fill up so quickly that  people are turned away.</p>
        <p>And that is beginning to worry festival organizers.</p>
        <p>Not unlike the region itself -- Mount Crested Butte and the larger town three miles below, Crested Butte -- the wildflower festival has reached a critical point, forcing organizers to confront thorny questions of how to manage growth while preserving the reasons for which the festival became so popular. In its early years, about 100 people attended. By the end of this year's events on Sunday, organizers say 2,500 will have participated.</p>
        <p>''We began with a handful of people, and we ended up getting bigger every year,'' said Dana Bradley Spencer, a wildlife biologist who is the festival's board president. ''If we get too big, we can't really offer the quality and specialness of teaching people about the flowers. Visitors want a quaintness, stylized to fit their enjoyment of flowers.''</p>
        <p>For now, groups of a dozen or so seem manageable. Leading a two-and-a-half-hour hike on Tuesday, Alison Gannett, a botanist from the University of Vermont, had plenty of time to spot more than two dozen varieties of wildflowers, discuss their characteristics, answer questions and keep group members from trampling too many other flowers to see the ones she was pointing out.</p>
        <p>With a group that size, Ms. Gannett never had to raise her voice when explaining that yarrow, a purple flower, is a natural antibiotic, or that according to folklore, sheep that eat false skunk cabbage, a pale green plant, give birth to offspring with only one eye -- ''sheep cyclops,'' she said. In a larger group, some might have missed that.</p>
        <p>Just as Ms. Spencer said organizers would have to review this year's festival to decide how much, if at all, it could grow next year, the owners of the ski resort are also contemplating how to expand without overwhelming a region that visitors have always appreciated for its charm and community spirit.</p>
        <p>As a ski area, Crested Butte cannot match the size or glitz of the larger ski resorts in Colorado. Former President Jimmy Carter visits here annually, and James MacArthur, the actor who played Danno on ''Hawaii Five-0,'' lives here. But that is about it for the town's famous connections.</p>
        <p>What Crested Butte does have in common with nearly every other Colorado ski resort is a recent downward economic trend. Warm winters and a lack of snow have cut sharply into the number of skier-visits, which is defined as one skier skiing per day. Over the last two winters, the number at Crested Butte has fallen by 24 percent, compared with the statewide average decline of 9 percent.</p>
        <p>The Callaway family, which owns the ski resort, has known for years it has to change to remain competitive. It helps that the wildflower festival and dozens of other cultural events are drawing more people into the area in summer. But the ultimate health of a ski resort depends upon skiing facilities, amenities and ease of access to the slopes. Expanding them has become no less perplexing to the Callaway family than the same issue on a smaller scale is to the wildflower organizers.</p>
        <p>''Every time you put in a new lift or a new hotel, it echoes down the valley,'' Edward C. Callaway, the resort's president and chief executive, said today, explaining why the family has taken a slow approach to growth that preserves open space, rather than adopt an aggressive strategy that could choke the region with traffic, overwhelm the supply of housing and drive out ranchers whose families have worked land in the valley for generations.</p>
        <p>More than anything, the resort needs a second mountain for skiing, and it has one nearby, Snodgrass Mountain. By adding intermediate ski runs to Snodgrass to complement the beginner and expert runs that Crested Butte Mountain has in abundance, the resort would become  more attractive to more families.</p>
        <p>But for now, Mr. Callaway said, that will wait, and the owners will spur growth at a more modest rate.</p>
        <p>''We want to grow but we want to grow smart, by putting in development where it exists, not where it doesn't exist,'' Mr. Callaway said. ''We've drawn a line in the flowers, and we never want to go over it.''</p>
