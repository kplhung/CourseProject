        <p>Hit-and-Run Joke Runs Into Trouble</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the actress HALLE BERRY had the final answer. With REGIS PHILBIN on jury duty, the comedian HOWIE MANDEL was filling in as a host on the syndicated talk show ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'' Ms. Berry was scheduled to be a guest and was waiting in the green room.</p>
        <p>Midway through the ''host chat'' segment at the beginning of the show, Mr. Mandel told KATHIE LEE GIFFORD that Ms. Berry had crashed into him backstage and had left the scene of the accident.</p>
        <p>There was embarrassed laughter from the audience. Mr. Mandel's line referred to a hit-and-run automobile accident on Feb. 23 in Los Angeles for which Ms. Berry was fined $13,500 and ordered to do 200 hours of community service. Ms. Berry, who pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge, crashed into another car and left the scene.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berry's segment on ''Live'' came a few minutes after Mr. Mandel's remark. She asked Mr. Mandel how he could ''disrespect me right while I'm here,'' adding that ''a woman was hurt'' in the February hit-and-run. She also asked Mr. Mandel why he didn't ''disrespect me on some other day when I'm not here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mandel said, ''I apologize on national television,'' adding, again and again, ''I'm sorry.''</p>
        <p>Later, Ms. Berry's manager, VINCE CIRRINCIONE, said: ''Whatever was there was resolved there, that's it. There's no more. There's no afterlife. It's self-explanatory, that's what it is.''</p>
        <p>Outfits to Match Midtown Scenery</p>
        <p>After nearly 18 months as president of the Grand Central Partnership, ALFRED C. CERULLO 3rd has changed one of the group's most visible symbols: the uniforms its 58 sanitation workers wear while collecting trash in Midtown. Mr. Cerullo, who inherited his job (and 58 white uniforms) from DANIEL A. BIEDERMAN, decided to outfit the employees in new forest green coveralls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biederman resigned in 1998 under pressure from MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI, who complained that Mr. Biederman had too much power as head of the Grand Central Parntership and a second Midtown business improvement district. Mr. Cerullo had been the city's finance commissioner.</p>
        <p>''At one point we considered blue,'' Mr. Cerullo said, but he vetoed that. ''I thought the green is a color that's part of the neighborhood. Our benches, our bike racks and our street lights are the same color. And truthfully, I didn't want to throw a new color into the mix.''</p>
        <p>Reading Rehnquist Just for Fun</p>
        <p>CHIEF JUDGE JUDITH S. KAYE'S day-to-day appointment calendar for July 3 through yesterday looked like something out of ''If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium'' -- except that she did not leave Manhattan until yesterday. On July 3, her son, JONATHAN, married NIELUFAR VARJAVAND, a physician. Between July 5 and Tuesday, she gave speeches to the Australian Bar Association and the American Bar Association, both of which go by the same three-letter abbreviation, A.B.A.</p>
        <p>She also addressed the National Conference of Bar Presidents, moderated a symposium on breast cancer law for the American group's Commission on Women and received an award at the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>In one speech, she quoted her 6-year-old granddaughter, who said she wanted to be a chief judge when she grew up.</p>
        <p>''Pretty good for 6,'' Judge Kaye said. ''When I was 6, I wanted to be a ballerina.''</p>
        <p>The next item on Judge Kaye's calendar was a vacation in Switzerland, where,  she said, she planned to read United States Supreme Court decisions from the term that has just ended.</p>
        <p>''It's fun to read Supreme Court opinions in the Alps,'' she said. ''You don't get the profundity of them until you're in the Alps.''</p>
