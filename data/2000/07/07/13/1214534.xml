        <p>In the days leading to the Camp David peace talks, a foreign policy adviser to Gov. George W.

        <p>In the days leading to the Camp David peace talks, a foreign policy adviser to Gov. George W. Bush counseled Israeli officials to accept only a comprehensive peace agreement and to resist any efforts by the Clinton administration to use the summit meeting in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The comments by the adviser, Richard Perle, caused Mr. Bush to distance himself today from those views. Mr. Bush said Mr. Perle had been ''speaking for himself'' and not the Bush campaign when he talked with Yossi Alper, an aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and another Israeli official, Yoram Ben-Zeev.</p>
        <p>''I wish the administration all the best when it comes to bringing peace to the Middle East,'' Mr. Bush said, appearing outside the governor's mansion after an hour-long meeting with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. Mr. Bush said that he opposed any efforts to politicize the peace talks and that ''my campaign will not do so.''</p>
        <p>He added that, ''This is an important time, and it's important for Republicans to wish the administration well. There would be nothing better than a lasting peace in the Middle East.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that President Clinton ''deserves credit'' for his efforts to try to achieve a lasting peace settlement between the Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perle is one of a small circle of former state and defense department officials from previous Republican administrations who advise the governor on foreign policy, though they are not paid staff members of the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>A leading Democrat seized on a report today about Mr. Perle's action in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>''Are Governor Bush and his advisers interested in peace or politics for Israel?'' asked Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee. ''We should all be hoping that Camp David is successful, not figuring out how to score political points.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perle said in an interview today that he had long been involved in Middle East policy. He said he had told the two officials in the days leading up to the meeting between Mr. Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, that Israel should try to achieve a comprehensive peace agreement resolving all outstanding issues, including the final status of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Officials on all sides of the talks have said that a good partial agreement might be the only realistic end to this meeting at Camp David.</p>
        <p>''If the West Bank issues were separated from the Jerusalem issue, I though it would greatly diminish the chances of a resolution of the Jerusalem question,'' Mr. Perle said. He said Jerusalem would then become the ''focal point'' of the conflict between the two sides.</p>
        <p>He said that a Bush aide had called him about the article in The Post this morning and that he recounted what he had said and had not said. He denied the contention in the article that he had told the Israelis not to let Vice President Al Gore participate in the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perle said he did, however, tell the Israelis that they ought to avoid being drawn into American presidential politics. ''I said 'the administration may be tempted to inject a partisan note in this and I hope you resist any such effort.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perle said he was not injecting politics into the meeting but was trying to do ''exactly the opposite.''</p>
