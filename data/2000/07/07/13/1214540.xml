        <p>From his  opening salutation  ''I am a member of the N.A.A.C.P.; it's good to be home'' -- to his closing motivational cry -- ''I'm not asking you to read my lips; I'm asking you to read my heart!'' -- a spirited Al Gore summoned black voters today to support his presidential candidacy, reminding them of his long commitment to their cause and deriding Gov.

        <p>From his  opening salutation  ''I am a member of the N.A.A.C.P.; it's good to be home'' -- to his closing motivational cry -- ''I'm not asking you to read my lips; I'm asking you to read my heart!'' -- a spirited Al Gore summoned black voters today to support his presidential candidacy, reminding them of his long commitment to their cause and deriding Gov. George W. Bush as offering only words, not action.</p>
        <p>''I have come here not just in an election year, but year after year,'' the vice president told several hundred members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's largest civil rights organization. ''I have worked with you. I have stood with you. I am proud to have won some battles alongside you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's message, threaded thickly with his policy positions, was in deliberate counterpoint to Mr. Bush's speech to the same group on Monday, when the Texas governor was criticized by many in the organization who said he offered only breezy generalities. Mr. Bush was the first Republican presidential candidate to court the N.A.A.C.P. since his father spoke to the group in 1988; still, the governor received a tepid response compared with the rousing and repeated standing ovations that Mr. Gore drew today.</p>
        <p>The vice president delved into details, from his support of affirmative action and hate-crimes legislation to jobs and education. He said he would defend affirmative action ''because it is still needed in this country'' and it is ''good for our economy.''</p>
        <p>He reiterated his opposition to raising the retirement age for Social Security benefits and to Mr. Bush's proposal to divert some Social Security investment into the stock market. Mr. Gore spoke of his support for a patients' bill of rights, gun control and a full count of people in the census as opposed to sampling.</p>
        <p>Invoking the heroes of black history, from Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman to Thurgood Marshall and Rosa Parks, Mr. Gore promised to ban racial profiling so that motorists would not be pulled over simply for ''driving while black.''</p>
        <p>''I will make the D.W.B. offense obsolete in America,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He castigated Mr. Bush for invoking the notion of ''states' rights'' to avoid taking a position on whether South Carolina should remove the Confederate battle flag from its Statehouse.</p>
        <p>And he reminded his listeners of his longtime commitment to their concerns. ''I have made more trips to Africa than I have to Asia,'' the vice president said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's appearance comes amid some concern among his staff members that blacks have been left dispirited by the campaign. Black voters account for about 15 percent of the electorate, and they usually support Democrats overwhelmingly. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in May showed Mr. Gore with 69 percent of the black vote and about 17 percent for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>But President Clinton, by contrast, has more than a 90 percent approval rating among black voters. Analysts said Mr. Gore could probably claim that level of support by Election Day, but questioned the commitment of black voters.</p>
        <p>David Bositis, chief pollster for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, said: ''He'll get 90 to 95 percent of the black vote. The larger question for Gore really is black turnout, as opposed to his share of the black vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bositis said that Mr. Gore would inherit the good relations with blacks that the president had built up, stemming from the record economic expansion, low unemployment among blacks, numerous appointments of blacks to administration positions and falling crime rates.</p>
        <p>Also, Mr. Bositis said, Mr. Bush's message of being a ''different kind of Republican'' was aimed less at winning over black voters than at white swing voters.</p>
        <p>Still, he added, overall turnout in November is likely to be low, precisely because the economy is doing so well, and Mr. Gore's challenge is to activate his base, which he has had some difficulty doing. While polls show Mr. Bush winning the support of 90 percent of Republicans, Mr. Gore has the support of only about 70 percent of Democrats.</p>
        <p>Today's event was aimed at drumming up enthusiasm among voters who should be squarely behind him.</p>
        <p>This was evident in the introduction of Mr. Gore by William Lucy, an N.A.A.C.P. board member, who said, ''Al Gore, unlike a lot of other people, has not just discovered the N.A.A.C.P.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucy also noted Mr. Gore's lineage as the son of Senator Albert Gore, who supported most civil rights legislation (though he did not back the Civil Rights Act of 1964). ''He has drawn from that deep well of public consciousness given to him by his father,'' Mr. Lucy said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Lucy set a robustly partisan tone, although the N.A.A.C.P. cannot endorse candidates because of its tax-exempt status. In noting that the Clinton administration had nominated 57 African-American judges to the federal bench, he added, ''not a single Clarence Thomas among them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore easily assumed command of the audience. In imploring his listeners to work hard to help the Democrats recapture the House, Mr. Gore said: ''I want you to consider how much we can get done by taking back the Congress, how much justice will be redeemed when John Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, how much economic progress will be made when Charlie Rangel is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.''</p>
        <p>Amid gales of laughter, he prompted delegates to their feet with a cadenced ridicule of Mr. Bush's talk of compassionate conservatism -- ''Talk doesn't cost much,'' Mr. Gore said -- compared to his own record of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>''I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday afternoon,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But I remembered what scripture teaches in the Book of James, Chapter 2, Verse 18: 'Yay, a man may say thou hast faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.'''</p>
        <p>And he accused Mr. Bush of repeated failures to respond to minority voters, at one point offering a dramatized rendition of an imagined chilly, monosyllabic Bush response -- ''no'' -- to the family of James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in Texas in June 1998, when the family asked the governor to support legislation against hate crimes.</p>
        <p>N.A.A.C.P. officials seemed thrilled with Mr. Gore's performance. Julian Bond, the organization's chairman, said, ''The vice president had substance and Governor Bush had a drive-by photo opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Kweisi Mfume, the president of the organization, said he appreciated the fact that Mr. Bush spoke to the group, but acknowledged Mr. Gore's edge. ''Al Gore is pretty much a family member,'' Mr. Mfume said. He told reporters he could forgive Mr. Gore's support for the death penalty -- a subject Mr. Gore did not raise -- because his stand was principled and not political.</p>
        <p>Delegates to the convention were pleased, too. ''He's beautiful,'' said Faye Sandle, 64, of Denver.</p>
        <p>Joe Watson, 55, a meat cutter from Monterey, Calif., said: ''I believe Gore is more for the people. I like what he said about affirmative action, jobs and investing back in the communities.''</p>
        <p>Edith McDougald, 57, a schoolteacher from Glen Burnie, Md., said she would not hold Mr. Gore's support for the death penalty against him, because it was the only area where she disagreed with him. ''Bush's reaction to the executions will be in the negative for him,'' she said, referring to the recent execution of a black man in Texas.</p>
