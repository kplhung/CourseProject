        <p>I WILL say this for John Romero's Daikatana: For better or worse, it has kept me company.</p>
        <p>One of the defining qualities of three-dimensional shoot-'em-ups has been solitude. Invariably, you are on your own in a persistently evil world. Enemies are everywhere, friends are rare and allies rarer.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Half-Life adjusted that equation. While still centered on the player's character, it allowed you to recruit security guards and scientists who would obligingly follow you through the ravaged Black Mesa complex, opening locked doors and fighting to the death on your behalf. But these helpers operated within a limited area, accepted a narrow range of commands and ignored all the weapons and supplies lying around on the floor. And they didn't have much personality. Indeed, they were pretty much interchangeable.</p>
        <p>Allies with personality is the defining feature of Daikatana, which gives the main character two sidekicks, named Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara. They are more than interactive flotsam and jetsam. Once recruited by the player, they follow the main character, Hiro Miyamoto, from level to level. You can order them to fight, back off, hold position, follow the player or retrieve equipment for their own use. (Just as Hiro does, each sidekick has levels of health and armor.) You can't complete a section of the game without the sidekicks' accompanying you in close formation, and if one of them dies, the game ends.</p>
        <p>This long-awaited shooter sends the player through 24 enormous levels in four time periods -- ranging from ancient Greece to 25th-century Japan -- to seek out a mythic sword of power and restore life to a dark and decimated world. I found Johnson -- a bald bruiser with revenge in his heart -- suspended from a torture machine in a prison in the Japanese segment. (Mikiko turns up in a frozen laboratory toward the end of the same segment.) Johnson, a former security chief at the jail, proved pleasantly adept at clearing a room, obeying orders and keeping pace with my character. He climbed ladders, rode elevators and vaulted over gaps without special handling. Following me (as Hiro) at a significant distance, Johnson made his way through a series of rooms, jumped onto two wall fixtures and then a bookcase and crouched to enter the duct where I was waiting. When I sought to retrace my steps to the duct entrance, he turned around before I reached him and headed back the way we had come. Along the way, he commented on the grisly discoveries our little party made, and if I bumped into him, he told me off. He also gave me a hard time if I took too long to find a way out of a dead end.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Johnson had his faults. He lacked a certain level of self-awareness, and I had to guard against random acts of stupidity. Although he was initially unarmed, he took off with a vengeance after the first enemy he spotted and took him out, only to be immediately blindsided by a giant, missile-firing robot.</p>
        <p>When I dropped down an elevator shaft, Johnson failed to follow. And he was nowhere in sight when I finally made my way back to the top of the shaft. I had to restore a saved game and order him to stay at a crucial location.</p>
        <p>Still, I found it agreeable to look after someone else's welfare. Even in a shoot-'em-up with the noblest of story lines, you can wind up feeling like you are on a one-man killing spree -- an ugly sensation. Shepherding other characters through this gantlet lends the game a sense of community. It was not so much you against them as us against them. And this sense of community became even more palpable when the two sidekicks started talking to each other.</p>
        <p>The sidekicks are not Daikatana's only strong point. The layout of the levels recalls classics like Doom and Quake -- games Mr. Romero helped create before leaving Id Software to become a founder of Ion Storm, the company that developed Daikatana. These levels use space creatively. They abound in side roads, hideaways and secrets within secrets, and they dare and defy you to explore them thoroughly. Occasionally, wandering through explored terrain, I would wend my way to a place that I did not recognize, and that was a nice feeling.</p>
        <p>But although I am almost a quarter of the way through the game, Daikatana has yet to mature into the sum of its interesting parts. It may have to do with the game's soporific opening sequence. It may be the background noise. Johnson's idle chatter quickly became annoying and the high-pitched screaming that issued from the industrial workers in the Japanese levels when they saw a monster almost induced me to join them. Maybe it was the monsters themselves, which for all the effort put into the artificial intelligence of your allies were as dumb as the monsters in any shooter I have played. (I have yet to find a monster that puts the fear of God into me.)</p>
        <p>Finally, the other innovations were not as effective as Daikatana's use of sidekicks. The gems you will need to find to save a game are a clever twist that entices the player into Daikatana's many remote and secret areas. But they can also be infuriating. Every time you save, it costs you a gem. You may not find another until you have completed a run of difficult action sequences, and hence will have to repeat the tougher sections until you find one. In the apparently gem-free bowels of one level, I must have fallen to my death a dozen times or more while trying to cross a volcanic chasm.</p>
        <p>In addition, Daikatana borrows a page from role-playing games. For each kill, Hiro receives experience points that allow him to advance to higher levels. At each level, the player can assign a point to make him faster or to enhance one of four other skills. But this tends to reiterate, rather than supplement, tendencies that occur naturally within Daikatana. For example, even without an enhanced attack skill, the weapons you find grow more powerful as you progress into the game. The ability to increase the player's maximum vitality doesn't feel meaningful in an environment strewn with health-replenishing supplies.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Romero has hit upon something with the sidekick idea, and it will be interesting to see where he goes with it. I would like to see interactive dialogue -- perhaps via an ''advise'' command that would allow the sidekicks to offer tips within their areas of expertise -- and the ability to direct a character to a specific location.</p>
        <p>I also envision a wider variety of sidekicks with specialized abilities. A given sidekick's participation or nonparticipation could have a genuine impact on how the game plays out. You might find that you had inadvertently killed an expert hacker who might have smoothed your path through a difficult sequence, or enlisted a coward or a traitor. The possibilities are inviting.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, I'm at least grateful to have some company.</p>
