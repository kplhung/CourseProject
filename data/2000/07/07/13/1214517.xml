        <p>THE Yankees made a contingency trade for Juan Gonzalez. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees tried to make a trade for Sammy Sosa. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees traded for David Justice. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees yesterday traded for Denny Neagle. He is a pitcher.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Yankees, they did not allow George Steinbrenner's wide-eyed desire for a big-name big hitter to prompt them to clean their shelves of minor league and other prospects.

        <p>THE Yankees made a contingency trade for Juan Gonzalez. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees tried to make a trade for Sammy Sosa. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees traded for David Justice. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees yesterday traded for Denny Neagle. He is a pitcher.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Yankees, they did not allow George Steinbrenner's wide-eyed desire for a big-name big hitter to prompt them to clean their shelves of minor league and other prospects. Instead of sending them in a package to Detroit for Gonzalez or to the Cubs for Sosa, they delivered some prospects to Cleveland for Justice, a creditable run producer, and others to Cincinnati for Neagle, the best starting pitcher available in the weeks leading up to the July 31 nonwaiver trading deadline.</p>
        <p>The Neagle acquisition was costly in prospects, but it was and will be costly economically, too. The Yankees' timing, in fact, is impeccable. Bud Selig, the commissioner with the payroll disparity problem, has summoned the owners to New York for a meeting tomorrow. There they will receive the report from a committee assigned the task of figuring out how to solve baseball's economic imbalance.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are Exhibit A of a team that spends money with no concern for the ramifications their expenditures have for their poorer relatives. Maybe that's the way it should be. The Yankees, after all, are engaged in a free-market, free-enterprise pursuit. Steinbrenner is out to win championships and make money. If spending a few extra million here or there produces a pennant and an invitation to the October dance, by all means spend the money.</p>
        <p>With the addition of Neagle and his $4.75 million salary, the Yankees' payroll, which passed the unprecedented $100 million milestone when Justice arrived, climbs still higher to about $107 million. But that's not the only economic element at work here.</p>
        <p>Two of the four minor leaguers the Yankees gave the Reds are Jackson Melian and Drew Henson. When Melian was a 16-year-old Venezuelan in 1996, the Yankees got him with a then-unprecedented $1.6 million signing bonus. When they drafted Henson two years ago, they bought a share of his future sports plans for a $2 million signing bonus.</p>
        <p>Henson was a top-notch high school quarterback who intended to play football in college. The Yankees made it worth his while to leave his options open and play baseball in the summer before playing football in the fall. Had they retained Henson and he had opted for the N.F.L., they would have eaten the $2 million and not suffered indigestion.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees have now taken that $3.6 million investment in Melian and Henson and used it to secure a pitcher who could put his left arm in their pitching dike and stem the tide that threatens to sweep them away from their October goal. And, of course, the Yankees don't want Neagle to work for them only for the rest of the season. With his free agency looming after the season, they will want to sign him -- and he's eager to accommodate them -- to a contract extension to keep him around. How would $9 million a year sound?</p>
        <p>The numbers that follow the dollar signs add to a big, big total. With the Yankees, it doesn't stop. The printing press in the basement at Yankee Stadium keeps pouring out the cash. If the secretaries and the executives think they have it tough having to be at their desks on time and not leaving a minute early in case the owner calls, what about those little old men running the money machine? They're not allowed to leave. Other teams find the playing surface uneven because the Yankees can afford to make mistakes, and most of them can't.</p>
        <p>Out in the international arena, the Yankees have signed Melian, Alfonso Soriano, Ricardo Aramboles, Hideki Irabu, Orlando Hernandez, Wily Mo Pena and Adrian Hernandez. If one or two of those remaining players and others fail to make it, the Yankees will balance the lost bonus against profits, shrug it off and pursue another unproven Latin or Asian kid.</p>
        <p>Most other teams feel they have to be more protective of their bonus money. They have to reduce the hit-or-miss ratio to as tiny a number as possible before committing a few million here or there. Who else last year would have given Pena, then a 17-year-old Dominican outfielder, $2.4 million to sign?</p>
        <p>The commissioner usually cringes when the Yankees make yet another move involving money (they all do, don't they?). Maybe this move, though, he will welcome, considering the timing. Maybe Selig can use this one, letting it incense the other owners to the point that it induces them to accept some radical form of revenue sharing the blue-ribbon task force might propose, Steinbrenner be damned.</p>
