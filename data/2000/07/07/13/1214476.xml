        <p>NEWS</p>
        <p>21st-Century Jesus</p>
        <p>In a park in an inner city where poverty and homelessness blight people's lives, Beelzebub stalks Mary Magdalene and waits to capture Jesus. So goes ''Gethsemane Park.'' This gospel opera with a libretto by Ishmael Reed and music by Carman Moore opens, after previews tonight and tomorrow, at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, 236 East Third Street in the East Village. Originally commissioned by the San Francisco Opera, ''Gethsemane Park,'' directed by Rome Neal, draws on African and Western sources and fuses classical and contemporary musical styles.</p>
        <p>Departure and Arrival</p>
        <p>After the tall ships in New York Harbor, what? How about seven tepees about 20 feet high and 16 feet at the base between the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island? The little American Indian village on anchored rafts is being built today and tomorrow and is to be on display from Saturday through July 23. During daylight, smoke will billow from the tepees, and at night they will glow from within. The work, ''Powwow,'' evoking displacement at a site of immigration, is by the Conceptual artist Gregory Lee Pickard, who says the best views are from Liberty State Park in New Jersey and Ellis Island.</p>
        <p>Diva's Doings</p>
        <p>She does stand-up comedy. She writes. She sings. She stars off and on Broadway in one-woman shows. She is Sandra Bernhard, and rather than rest on her laurels, she is exercising her talents at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater in ''Songs I Sang on the Kibbutz.'' Backed by a five-piece rock band, Ms. Bernhard's musical trip includes improvisational song, comedy and conversation. With performances at 8:30 p.m., the engagement continues through tomorrow and returns from Wednesday to July 22 and July 26 to 28.</p>
        <p>Tunes of Glory</p>
        <p>What is the greatest song ever written? According to some 20 famous songwriters, the answer is: The Beatles' ''In My Life.'' This autobiographical John Lennon composition from the ''Rubber Soul'' album of 1965 beat out the Rolling Stones' ''Satisfaction.'' The results were achieved from a compilation of Top 10 lists submitted by songwriters like Paul McCartney of the Beatles, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, the lyricist Jerry Leiber and Hal David, Burt Bacharach's collaborator. In third place was ''Over the Rainbow,'' performed by Judy Garland, followed by ''Here, There and Everywhere'' (The Beatles); ''Tracks of My Tears'' (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles); ''The Times They Are A-Changin' '' (Bob Dylan); ''Strange Fruit'' (Billie Holiday); ''I Can't Make You Love Me'' (Bonnie Raitt); ''People Get Ready'' (The Impressions) and ''You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' '' (The Righteous Brothers).</p>
