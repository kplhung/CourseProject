        <p>Saying that globalization is showing no signs of slowing and that further international financial crises are all but inevitable, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a wide-ranging set of prescriptions last night for preventing and coping with acute economic problems around the world.</p>

        <p>Saying that globalization is showing no signs of slowing and that further international financial crises are all but inevitable, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, offered a wide-ranging set of prescriptions last night for preventing and coping with acute economic problems around the world.</p>
        <p>Drawing on lessons learned during the financial crisis that began in Asia in 1997, Mr. Greenspan said industrialized and developing countries alike needed to focus on developing strong banking systems and active capital markets so that if one source of financing dried up, another would be available.</p>
        <p>He stressed the need for governments to regulate their financial systems adequately, for governments and the private sectors to provide investors with full and timely economic and financial information, and for governments not to insulate investors from risk by bailing them out when times become tough. And he warned about allowing a buildup of debt within the financial system.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions in the United States or provide any hints about whether the Fed would raise interest rates again when it meets next, on Aug. 22. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled to testify about monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee next Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan broke no new ground in his speech. But he said it was ''essential that we employ the current period of relative international financial stability to address as best we can some of the more evident short-run potentials for crises.''</p>
        <p>The key, he said, is to develop ''flexible institutions that can adapt to the unforeseeable needs of the next crisis, not financial Maginot lines.''</p>
        <p>One reason to be flexible, he said, is the complexity of the financial transactions and instruments through which capital flows around the world. The best insurance against allowing a nasty surprise to develop under the cloak of complexity, he suggested, is to limit the amount of debt in the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan spent much of his speech building a case that countries with both strong banking systems and healthy capital markets were far better able to weather financial troubles than countries that have only one or the other.</p>
        <p>Countries like Thailand and Japan that relied heavily, if not exclusively, on their banking systems found themselves without another steady source of capital when their banks ran into trouble, he said. But countries like the United States and Sweden, he said, have come through crises relatively unscathed because they were able to turn to banks when their capital markets landed in trouble, and vice versa.</p>
