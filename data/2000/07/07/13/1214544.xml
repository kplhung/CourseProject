        <p>In a historic first, the New Hampshire House of Representatives impeached the chief justice of the State Supreme Court today, accusing him of four ethical lapses and handing his fate over to the State Senate for trial.</p>
        <p>The 253-to-95 vote on Chief Justice David A. Brock culminated weeks of constitutional agony in New Hampshire, triggered by a nasty divorce.</p>
        <p>The divorce of one of the five Supreme Court justices led to an inquiry by the state attorney general into the court's practices, which led lawmakers to examine whether there were grounds for impeachment.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly today, House members decided that there were grounds to impeach Chief Justice Brock, though they spared two of his Supreme Court colleagues, Justices Sherman Horton and John Broderick. The House had last impeached a Supreme Court justice in 1790, and it had never before impeached a chief justice.</p>
        <p>The Republican-dominated House, by roughly 2 to 1, not particularly along party lines, approved four articles of impeachment against Chief Justice Brock, 64. They accused him of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago seeking to influence a case; of allowing the divorcing justice to influence the appointment of judges in his own case; of allowing judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves, and of repeatedly lying under oath.</p>
        <p>''This investigation, if it accomplishes nothing else, has lifted the skirt of Lady Justice and taken a peek,'' said Henry P. Mock, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which recommended the impeachment. ''Did we see anything there that was really, really naughty? Not too bad, but we have seen things that were absolutely wrong. Not only that, but her blindfold slipped. Justice is blind, but she took a peek and she wasn't supposed to.''</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock, who was not present today, has acknowledged that he made errors of judgment. But one of his lawyers, David Barry, said the chief justice contended that they were not impeachable conduct, and that he looked forward to the opportunity to clear his name.</p>
        <p>The House vote ''will be viewed as a historic aberration,'' Mr. Barry said, and possibly a dangerous one because ''it has lowered the impeachment bar and put at risk the independence of the judiciary.''</p>
        <p>The Senate, advised by a former United States senator, George Mitchell, is expected to begin the trial next month, and even advocates of today's impeachment are predicting that Chief Justice Brock is likely to prevail there.</p>
        <p>''They'll clean our clocks in the Senate,'' said Representative Tony F. Soltani, a Republican, pointing out that the Senate tends to be more sympathetic to the judiciary than the 400-seat House.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some opponents of impeachment today complained in the House hallways that they believed the impeachment was based not on the facts but on festering anger against the State Supreme Court for its 1997 ''Claremont'' decision requiring the state to revamp its heavily local system for financing schools. The state is still struggling to work out a new system.</p>
        <p>''I think, because Brock was a substantial influence in getting the Claremont decision passed, that this was in part a great backlash against him,'' said Beth Rodd, Democrat of Bradford and formerly of Brooklyn. ''I don't feel that justice is being done. I feel there's a vindictive spirit, a mob mentality has taken over.''</p>
        <p>But advocates of the impeachment said it was necessary to restore public confidence in the court.</p>
        <p>The divorcing justice, W. Stephen Thayer III, could influence the selection of judges for his divorce, while his wife could not, Mr. Soltani commented, and that ''is repulsive to me, repulsive beyond belief.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said today that she was committed to doing all she could to restore confidence in the courts, including pushing a constitutional amendment providing that judges be appointed for set terms rather than for life.</p>
        <p>The New Hampshire standards for impeachment are lower than the federal standards that became familiar to many during President Clinton's impeachment proceedings. It is enough, under New Hampshire law, for a judge to commit no ''high crime or misdemeanor'' but merely ''maladministration'' -- a word that lawmakers seemed to have trouble defining today. Some argued that since it was listed together with bribery and corruption, it must involve malice and ill-intent.</p>
        <p>Many speakers said today that the chief justice's main error had been one of compassion, in that he had felt sorry for Justice Thayer, and tried to help him.</p>
        <p>''Are we going to hang a man for compassion?'' demanded one lawmaker, Richard Kennedy.</p>
        <p>But advocates of impeachment depicted the chief justice's misdeeds as too serious to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>He was accused of making a phone call in 1987 to a Superior Court judge who was hearing a contract dispute, and reminding him that one of the litigants was a powerful senator who could influence judicial pay increases. Chief Justice Brock has denied making such a call.</p>
        <p>He was also accused of committing ''maladministration'' in February when he informed Justice Thayer which judges he would appoint to a special panel needed to hear the Thayer divorce case because the Supreme Court justices had all recused themselves. When Chief Justice Brock made that announcement, witnesses said, Justice Thayer objected to one of the judges, and Chief Justice Brock tried to hold back the court clerk from calling that judge.</p>
        <p>Thus far, Chief Justice Brock has had little chance to mount his own defense. But his day will come in the Senate, Mr. Barry said.</p>
        <p>''The citizens of New Hampshire should make no mistake,'' he said, ''this man has been on trial for three months now, and he's had no due process, no rights and no voice. This 'jury' that convicted him today has acted as a result of a one-sided process.''</p>
