        <p>After 10 days of chaotic infighting, the elder statesmen of the recently defeated governing party have agreed on a formula aimed at maintaining internal discipline as the party's long monopoly over Mexican power and wealth draws to a close.</p>
        <p>The Institutional Revolutionary Party, with a tradition of submission to the whims of successive presidents, seemed suddenly to spin out of control last week after Mexicans voted the party from power for the first time since its founding in 1929.</p>
        <p>The party's defeated presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, went into seclusion. The party's top leader, Dulce Maria Sauri, resigned her post, and several hard-liners shattered a taboo by harshly criticizing President Ernesto Zedillo, and at least three rival factions lunged for control.</p>
        <p>But late on Tuesday, leaders of the party, known as the PRI, announced measures to restore some order, signaling that the internal coup attempts had failed, at least for now.</p>
        <p>After a six-hour meeting with Mr. Zedillo at the presidential compound, the 21 state governors who are in the PRI announced that they had persuaded Ms. Sauri to remain in her post for a few months while the party decided how to choose her replacement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sauri's 12 top party aides, all appointed by Mr. Labastida, were allowed to resign, however. In their place, the governors announced the creation of an advisory committee made up of the 15 or so living former presidents from the party. The committee will help mediate a discussion over how to nurse the PRI back to health after its stunning defeat at the hands of Vicente Fox Quesada, the president-elect who will take office on Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>''Several factions tried to seize control, and they all failed,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, a political scientist who wrote a book last year that analyzed situations for the future of the party. ''The governors have bought some time. Now the urgent task is to decide on a way to pick a new leader with the legitimacy to guide the party as it seeks new foundations.''</p>
        <p>Some factions have suggested that the National Political Council of the party, a group whose members Mr. Zedillo picked, should select the party's new leader. Some members are proposing to elect the leader in the fall in what would be the party's first national convention since 1996. Others are calling for the new leader's selection in national grass-roots balloting in which hundreds of thousands of members would be eligible to participate.</p>
        <p>The governors' meeting with Mr. Zedillo seemed to bring a temporary truce to the infighting. Among the factions appearing to contend for power was one allied with Interior Minister Diodoro Carrasco and one led by Gov. Roberto Madrazo Pintado Tabasco, who was second to Mr. Labastida in the primary election last year.</p>
        <p>Party graybeards appear to have succeeded in imposing some order, partly because of a dawning sense of the extraordinary challenges ahead. Local elections are scheduled in three states before the end of the year. The party has to choose legislative leaders for the new Congress that begins work on Sept. 1, and it has to decide what posture to adopt toward Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>Some leaders are urging that the party should do everything possible to hobble Mr. Fox, whose center-right party will control neither the Chamber of Deputies nor the Senate.</p>
        <p>''He's going to head the kind of government that delights an opposition, with limited powers -- extremely limited,'' former Gov. Manuel Bartlett of Puebla said last week. ''And we PRI members have the power to impose those limits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett has been among the most outspoken critics of Mr. Zedillo, faulting him for Mr. Labastida's defeat.</p>
        <p>''President Zedillo has lost the capacity to lead,'' Mr. Bartlett told PRI leaders at party headquarters on July 3, a day after the voting. ''He should not lead our party for even one minute more!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett's comments stunned Mexico, because PRI leaders have rarely criticized a sitting president. In recent days, Mr. Bartlett has appeared to be a faction of one, and several colleagues have spoken out in Mr. Zedillo's defense. For his part, the president has urged cooperation with Mr. Fox's government, in the pursuit of prosperity.</p>
        <p>That was the line that Mr. Labastida adopted on Tuesday night, when he appeared in a television interview for the first time since the balloting. Reflecting with considerable dignity on the lessons of his defeat, Mr. Labastida wished Mr. Fox success.</p>
        <p>''If his government does well,'' Mr. Labastida said, ''our country will do well.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 14, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about efforts by Mexico's governing party to regroup after losing the presidential election misstated the name of a faction leader, the governor of Tabasco state. He is Roberto Madrazo Pintado; Tabasco is not part of the name.</p>
