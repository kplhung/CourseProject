        <p>SEVERAL homeowners, cell phones at hand, tend their lawns and gardens. Others are firing up a barbecue in the backyard, while on the street children ride mountain bikes or skate by on Rollerblades. Two little girls talk about going with their mothers to get a bite to eat at McDonald's.</p>
        <p>It could be Pleasantville, but the pork shish kebab on the grill, cooked faithfully every weekend instead of hamburgers, is just one sign that it probably is not. This is Kolomyaga, a condominium development on the fringes of St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>The sight of four tidy rows of eight town houses, aligned in a square, has shaken this previously poor village, but not because it is luxurious. Neighboring brick mansions, with Mercedes-Benzes parked out front, have already numbed local residents to displays of wealth.</p>
        <p>What is turning heads at Kolomyaga is the novelty of American-style suburban architecture transplanted onto Russian soil. The signs are small but telling. Lawns neatly manicured where they used to run wild. A five-foot security fence and guards to keep out the riffraff. Volleyball areas for children. Aluminum siding on the houses. Fords in the driveway. And fast food is a mere 10-minute drive.</p>
        <p>No one is saying that this city on the Neva River has solved its decades-old housing problem. Most of its five million inhabitants still live in prefab high-rises, a Soviet-era legacy, in which three generations in a tiny apartment is not uncommon. By the 1990's the few with money built year-round country mansions. But beyond the country house and city apartment, a third way is emerging -- the small family house -- with some things lost and some gained.</p>
        <p>As the American suburban dream infiltrates Russia's second-largest city, it is giving added legitimacy and visibility to Russia's version of the middle-class homeowner. There is even a new Russian word for condo: town khaus.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurs and small-business owners, mainly couples in their 30's with small children, the town khausers of Kolomyaga are well enough off to choose a new $75,000 condo 20 minutes from downtown. (A nice city apartment costs no less than $50,000, with $20,000 more in renovations.)</p>
        <p>''These condo residents want their house to be their castle so they can retreat away from the rest of the world,'' said Viktoriya Ukhalova, a St. Petersburg architect and interior designer. ''This is a reaction to decades of forced communal living. Now, people have a choice.''</p>
        <p>Inside the two-story houses, there is little to be impressed by. The goal is basic comfort and function: kitchen, Dad's office, master bedroom, two bedrooms for the kids and a living room. The big change is adjusting to country living.  Though living rooms are large, residents still entertain their guests in the kitchen, an ancient habit of peasant origins, when the warm kitchen was the most hospitable room during the long, cold Russian winters.</p>
        <p>''We must tend the yard, and there are added travel costs,'' said Vasily Ryzhkov, 32, who owns a dental clinic downtown. ''But it is worth it to live in the fresh air and have your own house.''</p>
        <p>As pleasant as life can be outside the inner city, Russian suburbs have disadvantages. They lack good schools or stores nearby. Life is still rustic, and the city remains the sole source of civilized amenities.</p>
        <p>Still, Kolomyaga residents relish being able to retreat into their spacious homes, some 1,500 square feet of living space on three floors. Each unit has a small yard in front and back, and wives groom their tiny plots, something rare in Russia, where yards tend to be weedy or dedicated to growing food.</p>
        <p>While necessity forces women to work, some successful Russian businessman regard a working wife as an insult to their masculinity. ''Here my wife sits home with the children, can sit in the yard or walk around the area, and is not cooped up,'' Mr. Ryzhkova said proudly.</p>
        <p>The emerging professional class, with leisure to tend gardens, has even led to the appearance of a retail outlet called Maxidom, Russia's answer to Home Depot.</p>
        <p>Suburban settlements began in Moscow about five years ago but are just starting to sprout in St. Petersburg. Kolomyaga was conceived in 1997 by Vladimir Lubomirov, and the first families moved in a year ago. Mr. Lubomirov, 32, who was raised in St. Petersburg, built his first family home (for a Finnish buyer) in 1991 while still studying for a master's degree in physics. Kolomyaga is his first large-scale project.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people are surprised there are such nice suburban housing complexes, and here just within the city limits,'' Mr. Lubomirov said, giving a tour of the complex one sunny weekend.</p>
        <p>Drivers slow down to gawk. Some people remark that the aluminum siding, banned by zoning laws until a few years ago, makes the houses look fake, like a toy village. Indeed, the contrast between old and new is surreal. Across the street from the complex stands a row of dilapidated wooden shanties, built just after World War II, yards overgrown with bushes and trees.</p>
        <p>Farther down the road are two new brick mansions, viewed by many as emblems of capitalism's criminal element. Looking like medieval keeps but oddly known as kottedzhi, or cottages, they are surrounded by eight-foot brick walls.</p>
        <p>Change and progress have always been painful in Russia, and old and new sometimes have trouble coexisting, even at Kolomyaga. Symbolic of the conflict is a 50-year-old village house, in relatively good condition, inhabited by a couple in their late 50's. It, and they, stand in the way of completing a row of condos.</p>
        <p>''There's no way my wife and I plan to give up our home in the country, in this place, where she grew up and where I've lived for the last 30 years,'' said one of the owners, who would give only the name Igor. ''I don't have any ill feeling toward the new neighbors, and I understand it's progress, but it's too bad that what was once a real village is now disappearing.''</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Lubomirov's offer of a condo could not sway Igor, who says there is something special about living in a primitive wooden house. Indeed, sentimental fondness for the simple rustic life and a desire to be close to nature run deep in the Russian soul, one reason that urban Russians, even wealthy ones, retreat to their dachas on weekends.</p>
        <p>As one indication of what has been lost in the transition from village life to suburbia, Kolomyaga has not only a five-foot metal fence around its five acres but also two uniformed police officers, who stand guard around the clock. They are a reminder that economic reforms have failed to reach the underclass.</p>
        <p>''In Russia, the law does not effectively defend private property, and people do not respect the property of others,'' Mr. Lubomirov said.</p>
        <p>''Here, there are no dens of vice that attract a bad element,'' said Dmitri Rakovshchik,'' a resident and vice president of a Russian insurance company. ''Before, we lived in a nice apartment in the city center, but our building entrance was filthy and dangerous. Here, it's safer, because in the center there are always problems with vandals and hooligans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryzhkov said, ''You can park your car in front of your house and not worry it will be stolen.''</p>
        <p>At Kolomyaga, each household owns at least one car, compared with Russia's national average of 20 percent of households. (Local roads, dusty and cratered with gaping ditches, do a job on them, however.)</p>
        <p>Living in a condo complex raises issues that hark back to Soviet living, like communality. Most condo owners escaped from the city to be masters of their own castles but are finding they must pull together.</p>
        <p>General meetings are held when the need arises, to collect money for repairs or improvements, but no one seems to mind, because all have interests at stake.</p>
        <p>Though Kolomyaga's main selling points are space and security, the condos are also marketed with a strong element of class consciousness (middle class in the American understanding but rich for Russia, where the average person lives on $50 to $100 a month.) Most marketing was done through word of mouth.</p>
        <p>''One of the pluses that attract buyers to our complex is that we offer more social homogeneity,'' Mr. Lubomirov said. ''In Russia, it is common for poor and rich to live in the same building. And this is not always pleasant, for many reasons.''</p>
        <p>While it is tempting to see such economic segregation as part of a turn to American-style class divisions, it confirms Soviet habits predating the mixed-income high-rise.</p>
        <p>''Soviet housing was highly segregated, where the ruling elite lived in large apartments in the best districts, while the masses lived in communal apartments and prefab high-rises,'' said Lev Savulkin, a senior analyst at the Leontieff Center for Social and Economic Research in St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>The freedom of the last 10 years has allowed acquiring wealth to become a personal affair, not tied to a ruling party. And now the newly rich are banding together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubomirov, however, is careful to keep out those who are too rich. ''No shaven heads'' -- meaning Russia's mafia elite -- he said. He has strict face control at Kolomyaga.</p>
        <p>Today, demand for middle-of-the-road housing is growing faster than supply, and he has bought and plans to level a half-dozen shanties, creating space for what he hopes will be 200 units and a dozen houses in the next four years.</p>
        <p>Near Kolomyaga are about six other such suburban settlements. Indeed, the city government has set the area aside for condo residences. ''The strong demand indicates how housing tastes, not to mention income patterns, have changed over the last eight years,'' said the developer, whose ponytail, soft voice and gaunt features suggest a struggling artist more than a businessman.</p>
        <p>He seems to be right. Two miles from Kolomyaga, dozens of new high-rises stand empty, while most condo complexes in the area fill quickly. Yet, as suburban as Kolomyaga may look, its 32 owner-residents have not totally adopted the American way of real estate.</p>
        <p>For one thing, it is difficult to get a mortgage in Russia, which means buyers make quarterly payments during construction to pay off the purchase price before they move in.</p>
        <p>As the demand for suburban housing expands, local government is responding with new programs. Moscow and St. Petersburg are both beginning to offer mortgages, giving home buyers a chance to spread housing costs over many years.</p>
        <p>St. Petersburg is going even further, saying it will provide roads, sewer hookups and schools on some 1,300 acres of forest land at the north end of the city, to be called Severnaya Dolina (Northern Valley), so developers can build hundreds of condos and houses. This will be the city's first large-scale suburban housing development.</p>
        <p>Northern Valley is only on the drawing board. In a country given to sudden financial crises like that in August 1998, which wiped out an emerging middle class, it is too early to say that American-style suburban living will become widespread in Russia. Some habits and ways of behavior will never change, no matter how affluent people become.</p>
        <p>Though Russians with money enjoy lavishing it on status symbols like nice cars, they will cut costs on basics. ''It's funny how people in the area, even those with money, are too cheap to pay for garbage removal,'' Mr. Lubomirov exclaimed with exasperation. ''So, what do they do? They load up their Mercedes or Fords with their garbage and haul it off to a dumpster in one of the nearby pre-fab housing projects.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''In some ways, Russians will probably never change.''</p>
