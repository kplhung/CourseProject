        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUSH LIKES THE ATTENTION -- Gov. George W. Bush said today that he did not mind Vice President Al Gore's focus on him and calls for the governor to step into the debate in Congress. ''I've been somewhat surprised by the reaction to this campaign by my opponent and the president,'' Mr. Bush told state party leaders at a Republican National Committee meeting in Austin, Tex. ''They seem to be talking about me a lot. They're talking about me and I'm talking about me, and that's the way I like it. I must have the president worried because he spends time talking about our campaign. That's a good sign.'' He also scoffed at Mr. Gore's criticism of Congress as a ''do nothing for people'' Legislature. ''He himself is the president of the Senate,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that Mr. Gore would give the country ''four more years of a president at war with Congress.''</p>

        <p>DUO PLAN BUS TOUR -- Senator John McCain, the former Republican presidential hopeful, will be revving up his Straight Talk Express this fall -- for House Republican Congressional candidates in at least half a dozen swing states. Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican, are planning to team up after their party's convention in Philadelphia later this month to campaign by bus on behalf of candidates in several states, including Ohio, California, Florida, New York, Illinois and Michigan. The campaign seeks to exploit the appeal of Mr. McCain and Mr. Watts, the only Republican African-American in Congress, with independents and other swing voters. The two would conduct their bus tour in August and October, when Congress is out of session. Mr. McCain and Mr. Watts will also start a Web site featuring online chats with the two Republican leaders from their bus.</p>

        <p>NADER WORRIES GORE CAMP -- Vice President Al Gore's new campaign chairman, William M. Daley, says Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, poses a threat to Mr. Gore's campaign, and allies inside and outside the campaign have made informal overtures to some key Nader supporters. ''There's been some discussions,'' Mr. Daley was quoted as saying on Tuesday by The Associated Press, ''kind of just, 'What is this? Why are you over there?' Nothing official where we've approached the candidate.'' Mr. Nader says at least three of his ''celebrity supporters'' have been contacted, one by the vice president himself, but he refuses to name them. Mr. Nader is drawing less than 10 percent in most polls and is given no real chance of winning. But he could hurt Mr. Gore because much of the support he has appears to come at Mr. Gore's expense, especially in swing states.</p>

        <p>GORE READY TO MEET BRADLEY -- Vice President Al Gore yesterday gave a preview of his scheduled meeting on Thursday with Bill Bradley, the former New Jersey senator and now-dispatched primary opponent. ''I'm looking forward to being with Bill Bradley,'' Mr. Gore said at a fund-raising reception in Livingston, N.J. ''We're going to have a great day together. I had a wonderful conversation with him a few days ago. I called, and we had a great talk, and from what he told me about his speech tomorrow, I think it's going to be a very hard-hitting speech.'' Mr. Gore was in New Jersey yesterday raising about $850,000 for the Democratic National Committee. He began at the home of Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, in Livingston, where about 70 people paid $5,000 each. He then went to Englewood, where he had dinner at the home of Orin Kramer, a lawyer and former Carter administration official, and his wife, Hilary Ballon, a professor of art history at Columbia University. About 40 people paid $12,500 each for the dinner, and the event raised nearly $600,000.</p>

        <p>THE MONEY</p>
        <p>SENATE COMMITTEES ARE FLUSH -- The Republican and Democratic Senate campaign committees released their June 30 fund-raising figures yesterday, with both showing big bank balances. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it had $27 million in the bank on June 30 after having raised $49 million since January 1999. The National Republican Senatorial Committee reported $21 million cash on hand at the end of June, having raised $55.7 million in this election cycle. Both said they had more cash on hand at this point in the election calendar than they had ever had in previous elections.</p>

        <p>POLITICAL GROUPS UNCLOAKED -- Political groups that until now have enjoyed the anonymity and secrecy of Section 527 of the tax code will have to file disclosure forms with the Internal Revenue Service by July 31. Moving quickly to carry out a law passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on July 1, the I.R.S. sent word yesterday to groups operating under Section 527 that they must disclose their existence and intent to operate under the tax provision, which governs political committees. The new law requires such groups to disclose their contributors, spending and the identities of senior officers, effective July 1.</p>
