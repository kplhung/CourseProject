        <p>Republicans in Congress moved closer today to passing their two main tax-cutting bills, with the House's finishing work on a previously passed tax reduction for married couples and the two parties' agreeing to a vote in the Senate this week on a plan to repeal the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 269 to 159, the House sent to the Senate a bill that would cut taxes on married couples by $182 billion over the next 10 years. The bill passed the House by a similar margin in February but was repackaged slightly by Republicans today so that it could be considered by the Senate under rules that would keep Democrats from stalling the bill or loading it with amendments.</p>

        <p>Republicans in Congress moved closer today to passing their two main tax-cutting bills, with the House's finishing work on a previously passed tax reduction for married couples and the two parties' agreeing to a vote in the Senate this week on a plan to repeal the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 269 to 159, the House sent to the Senate a bill that would cut taxes on married couples by $182 billion over the next 10 years. The bill passed the House by a similar margin in February but was repackaged slightly by Republicans today so that it could be considered by the Senate under rules that would keep Democrats from stalling the bill or loading it with amendments.</p>
        <p>Aides to the Republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he intended on Friday to bring to the floor a version of the bill that would cut taxes on couples by $248 billion over 10 years. The legislation is likely to win support from all 55 Republicans and perhaps a few Democrats.</p>
        <p>The White House has made clear that President Clinton would veto the tax cut for couples, saying the Republican plan costs too much, is skewed to upper income brackets and should be considered only after Congress and the administration have agreed on a plan to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Republicans have packaged the legislation as a repeal of the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads some two-income couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they had remained single. But the bill would provide a tax cut to nearly all couples, including those who receive a marriage bonus, a lower tax bill as a couple than they would pay if they had remained single.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott also negotiated an agreement today with his Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, to bring the proposed estate tax repeal to a vote in the Senate. The agreement permits Democrats to offer amendments that would allow them to make their point that full repeal of the estate tax would primarily benefit a few very wealthy people each year. The Democrats also argue that there are ways of reducing the tax while leaving money to address other pressing issues that affect far more voters, like health care, child care and college costs.</p>
        <p>The amendment to the estate tax bill that is likely to get the most attention will be offered by a Republican, Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan. It will call for suspension of all or nearly all of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax for 150 days. High gas prices have become a political issue this year, especially in the Midwest, and Mr. Abraham is in a tight re-election race.</p>
