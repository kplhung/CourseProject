        <p>Two centuries after George Washington signed into law a bill establishing a federal city on the Potomac, historians and lawmakers are now learning that most of the laborers who erected the White House and the Capitol were black slaves.</p>
        <p>A local television reporter, Edward Hotaling, several months ago unearthed Treasury Department pay slips in the Capitol dating back 200 years.

        <p>Two centuries after George Washington signed into law a bill establishing a federal city on the Potomac, historians and lawmakers are now learning that most of the laborers who erected the White House and the Capitol were black slaves.</p>
        <p>A local television reporter, Edward Hotaling, several months ago unearthed Treasury Department pay slips in the Capitol dating back 200 years. The pay slips showed that from 1792 to 1800 -- the years the reporter zeroed in on -- more than 400 of the 600 workers who helped erect the White House and the Capitol were black slaves whose wages were appropriated by their owners.</p>
        <p>Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress, led by Representative J. C. Watts Jr., Republican of Oklahoma, is calling for a task force to study the documents and recommend how best to commemorate the black slaves, who were never recognized or rewarded for their role. The memorial would occupy a ''prominent'' place in the Capitol, Mr. Watts said.</p>
        <p>''Who were these men who worked here?'' asked Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a one-time civil rights leader. ''What happened to them?''</p>
        <p>Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois, said it was important to honor the slaves who helped erect two of the country's most visible symbols of democracy, and not shy away from that fact.</p>
        <p>''Slavery indeed was a shameful period in the history of this nation but we have a responsibility not to run away from any aspect of it,'' Mr. Davis said. ''It's incumbent upon us to uncover and reveal what was actually taking place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hotaling said he came across the records in March while he was reporting a story on the 200th anniversary of the White House and the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Each pay slip contained the name of the plantation owner, the slave and the wages paid to the owner: $5 a month. Mr. Hotaling said he focused on the years 1792 and 1800, and then ran out of time.</p>
        <p>Construction of the Capitol was not completed until the 1860's, and the White House was finished in 1800. Slavery was not outlawed in Washington until 1865.</p>
        <p>Little else is known about the slave laborers, something Mr. Watts said he hoped to rectify with the task force, which would include several historians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watts said he expected the resolution to sail through the House and Senate in the next month, adding that he would like the task force to make its recommendations by year's end.</p>
        <p>In the Senate, the resolution is being sponsored by Senators Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas. It will be called, Mr. Watts said with a chuckle, the Abraham Lincoln resolution.</p>
