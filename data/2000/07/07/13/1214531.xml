        <p>In his office in Mexico City, Vicente Fox, Mexico's president-elect, has already received a lot of callers from K Street, Washington's corridor of political influence.</p>
        <p>Scores of law firms, lobbyists and public relations firms are preparing their pitches for the new government's business in Washington.</p>
        <p>The Mexican government spends millions of dollars annually to lobby the executive branch and Congress on trade, immigration, law enforcement and other issues and to burnish Mexico's image in the United States. But Mr. Fox, who is to be inaugurated in December, is likely to pick a new team of Washington lobbyists to press the political agenda of Mexico's new governing party, the National Action Party, known by the Spanish acronym PAN.</p>
        <p>''Probably some of the lobbyists who have worked with the old government will be cut,'' said Carlos Salazar, a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Fox. ''This is very natural.''</p>
        <p>That could be bad news for a number of firms in Washington with six-figure retainers from Mexico's current government, controlled by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.</p>
        <p>Although it does not employ as many Washington lobbyists as Japan or Hong Kong, Mexico has become one of the most prized foreign government accounts since 1993, when it assembled a $20 million armada of law, lobbying and public relations firms to help pass the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>In recent years Mexico has pared its team to about a dozen firms, including Public Strategies Inc., whose president, Joseph P. O'Neill, was a lead lobbyist for Mexico on Nafta.</p>
        <p>In the last six months, the government of the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo, has paid more than half a million dollars spread over various firms for lobbying on trade, immigration and law enforcement issues, according to reports filed with the Justice Department by the lobbyists.</p>
        <p>Besides Public Strategies, the list of lobbyists registered as foreign agents to represent Mexico's interests includes two high-powered Democratic law firms, Manatt Phelps and Phillips, and Verner, Liipfert, Berhard, McPherson and Hand.</p>
        <p>Manatt Phelps is headed by a former Democratic National Committee chairman, Charles Manatt, and Verner, Liipfert employs many prominent Democrats, including former Senate majority leader George J. Mitchell, though the former Senate Republican leader Bob Dole is also a member of the firm. The Mexican government also retains the law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox is not well known in Washington and has not yet established ties on K Street. This week a small group of Mr. Fox's international advisers, including Dr. Salazar, has been visiting Washington. The trip was packed with meetings with senators, House members and political scientists from local think tanks, but Dr. Salazar did not leave any time for lobbyists.</p>
        <p>''No, definitely not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since September, Dr. Salazar has made other good-will trips here, because leading PAN officials believed that the agenda and image of their party had been misrepresented in the United States by the PRI.</p>
        <p>In that time he has never met with lobbyists to discuss the possibility of new accounts or the renewal of existing accounts at firms that have ties to the current government.</p>
        <p>During the election, Mr. Fox relied on some political advisers from the United States, including Dick Morris, President Clinton's campaign veteran. That work is done, but Mr. Morris said of Mr. Fox, ''If there's anything he asked me to do, I certainly would do it.''</p>
        <p>The Fox government may decide to wait until the American elections in November are over to replace its lineup of lobbyists. If the Republicans win the presidency, Mr. Fox might want to retain firms with more prominent Republicans. One thing is certain: he will not have to look hard to find eager prospects for his business.</p>
        <p>A former United States ambassador to Mexico, Jim Jones, who is now a consultant at Manatt, Phelps and Phillips and has been advising Mr. Fox on the presidential transition, said several prominent lobbying firms had already flown to Mexico to court Mr. Fox as a client.</p>
