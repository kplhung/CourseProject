        <p>Toward the very end of ''Filao,'' when the members of the French circus troupe Les Colporteurs take up musical instruments and parade 10-strong across the single ring under the cramped little big top that is their home in Damrosch Park during Lincoln Center Festival 2000, a name comes to mind: Fellini.</p>
        <p>Like Cirque du Soleil, Les Colporteurs belong to the fraternity of new circus. And surely, with their modest though highly skilled tightrope act, their trapeze performances and  pratfalls, they pose no threat to three-ring extravaganzas like the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.</p>

        <p>Toward the very end of ''Filao,'' when the members of the French circus troupe Les Colporteurs take up musical instruments and parade 10-strong across the single ring under the cramped little big top that is their home in Damrosch Park during Lincoln Center Festival 2000, a name comes to mind: Fellini.</p>
        <p>Like Cirque du Soleil, Les Colporteurs belong to the fraternity of new circus. And surely, with their modest though highly skilled tightrope act, their trapeze performances and  pratfalls, they pose no threat to three-ring extravaganzas like the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus.</p>
        <p>Yet the apartness of the performers from the frenetic quotidian life of wired New York, their palpable commitment to venerable circus arts, the peripatetic lives that have taken them from France to the recent Spoleto Festival U.S.A. to a park in mid-Manhattan, evoke nothing so much as a little Felliniesque circus meandering through the provinces.</p>
        <p>Here today, gone tomorrow, leaving behind the memory of a break in the routine, some gentle laughter and admiration for the exotic and likable though not eye-popping entertainment that brings to a relaxing close a soft summer's night.</p>
        <p>As it happens, Les Colporteurs, whose artistic directors are Antoine Rigot and his wife, Agathe Olivier, is roughly translated as peddlers who carry their goods on their backs. So here is not the place to look for heavy circus artillery, hordes of rare animals (excepting humans, there are none at all) or daredevils looking to set records.</p>
        <p>Heavy on atmospheric lighting  and music that runs from evocative accordion to frenetic jazz, ''Filao'' is said to find its inspiration in ''The Baron in the Trees,'' an Italo Calvino novella about a nonconforming boy who gets up from the dinner table one night and spends the next 50 years in the treetops.</p>
        <p>But ''Filao,'' a title that plays on words involving the hardwood tree called filao and fil-a-haut, the French term for high wire, makes no pretense of literal retelling.</p>
        <p>Though wood, often in the form of Y-shaped limbs, plays a prominent role in the show's props, ''Filao'' which runs for about 75 minutes, consists of a dozen so-called movements.</p>
        <p>Of varying length, they involve the men and women of Les Colporteurs, notably David Dimitri with some nimble, acrobatic tightrope work, in feats of balance, swinging and twirling on ropes, being manipulated like a marionette, flying on a trapeze, clowning and juggling.</p>
        <p>Because of previous commitments by Mr. Dimitri, who is filling in for Mr. Rigot, injured at Spoleto, ''Filao,'' originally scheduled to run through July 26, will have its final performance at Lincoln Center on July 22.</p>
        <p>FILAO</p>
