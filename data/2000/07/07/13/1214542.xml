        <p>A little more than a year ago, it seemed, the future of the traditional brokerage firm was suddenly in doubt.</p>
        <p>Stocks of unprofitable upstart electronic brokers had soared while those of some Wall Street titans were sagging. Predictions of the demise of the broker ran rampant as investors flocked to the Internet, attracted by cheap trades and the ability to control their financial destinies.</p>
        <p>But, judging by the announcement yesterday that UBS A.G., the Swiss banking giant, will pay about $12 billion to buy the PaineWebber Group, the traditional brokerage firm is not dead yet -- far from it. At a purchase price of $73.50 a share, UBS is paying a rich premium of 47 percent over PaineWebber's closing price on Tuesday, before the deal was announced.</p>
        <p>Although some analysts said they thought UBS was paying too much, most agreed that PaineWebber's network of brokers who cater to investors with at least $500,000 in assets is a franchise that has proved far more valuable than its critics ever acknowledged through most of the last decade.</p>
        <p>PaineWebber has capitalized on the shift away from traditional pensions toward more reliance on individual retirement accounts, 401(k)s and the like, said Donald B. Marron, the company's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>''We've created a nation of individual pension fund managers -- 50 million of them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The firm earned more than $1 billion before taxes last year, more than triple its pretax profit in 1995. Its momentum has slowed somewhat recently. Yesterday, PaineWebber announced second-quarter earnings that were down 10 percent from a year ago before a charge for expenses related to the firm's $620 million acquisition of the brokerage house J. C. Bradford &amp; Company. Including the charge, PaineWebber earned $127.5 million, or 82 cents a share, down from $163.5 million, or $1.02 a share, in the second quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>Still, its success is a direct result of its ability to persuade wealthy investors to pay for advice on what they should do with their money. Most of those clients could save several thousand dollars a year by managing their money themselves through an account at E*Trade or Charles Schwab.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Marron has never wavered in his belief that they would not. He has long preached the value of personal advice and has staunchly refused to compete on price with the wave of discounters that has shaken up the brokerage business over the last few years.</p>
        <p>The purchase of PaineWebber came about six months after Schwab acknowledged the importance of offering advice to wealthy investors by agreeing to pay $2.7 billion for U.S. Trust, a New York-based firm that manages private money in much the same way as UBS does in Europe.</p>
        <p>Deals like that one demonstrate that ''you've got to keep moving upstream,'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at the Goldman Sachs Group. To gauge the threat posed to traditional brokerage firms by the electronic challengers, he said, ''All you have to do is look at where the pure e-brokerage stocks are trading today.''</p>
        <p>Shares of E*Trade are at $16.50, more than 70 percent below where they were trading in May 1999. Shares of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, by contrast, closed yesterday at a record high of $131.5625.</p>
        <p>While turmoil in the market, particularly big plunges in some technology stocks popular among individual investors, contributed to the reversal, this turnaround did not happen automatically. PaineWebber, along with its three bigger rivals -- Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Salomon Smith Barney -- moved last year to offer online trading for their own clients. Even more important, they repriced their basic brokerage accounts to narrow the cost gap between themselves and the discounters.</p>
        <p>''Full-service firms responded to the threat effectively,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Rather than appearing endangered, stockbrokers are in high demand. All of the major United States brokerage firms say they will continue to expand their ranks of brokers and some analysts expect PaineWebber's competitors to use the takeover as a reason to step up efforts to attract brokers from other firms.</p>
        <p>The competition for established brokers with client rosters is intense and most firms offer brokers big cash bonuses to defect and bring their customers' accounts with them. Those tussles often wind up in court as the firms scramble for customers.</p>
        <p>An undisclosed part of the $875 million UBS set aside to retain PaineWebber employees is earmarked for brokers. But holding on to its best brokers will be a challenge for PaineWebber because they tend to fear change and many of them will be cashing in restricted stock and options that they would have lost if they had left the firm before a buyout.</p>
        <p>In interviews yesterday, Mr. Marron and Marcel Ospel, UBS's chief executive, played down the likelihood of a culture clash when UBS takes control of the brokers in what would be the first direct acquisition of a leading United States brokerage firm by a foreign company.</p>
        <p>''We had no fear that this wouldn't be a perfect cultural fit,'' Mr. Ospel, 49, said as he puffed contentedly on a cigarette.</p>
        <p>He and other UBS executives and their financial advisers talked up the potential increase in revenue from selling to PaineWebber customers the stocks, bonds and other investment products created by the UBS investment banking operations. But that strategy runs the risk that the harder UBS pushes its own products, the more it threatens to alienate brokers and their customers.</p>
        <p>Some analysts argue that PaineWebber's success derives in part from an image of giving generally unbiased advice to its customers because its investment banking side -- where deals are struck and new companies are taken public -- has never mounted much of a threat to its competitors on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Moreover, while PaineWebber has built a strong asset management business, known as Mitchell Hutchins, the firm's own mutual funds account for only about a quarter of the funds sold by its brokers. In contrast, about three-fourths of the funds sold by Morgan Stanley's brokerage unit are its own.</p>
        <p>Executives of PaineWebber and UBS took pains yesterday to emphasize that PaineWebber's management would remain in place and only the investment banking operations of PaineWebber would be merged into UBS. Even then, they said, the number of job losses would be minimal because there is so little overlap between the two firms' operations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marron, 65, said he would stay on as chairman of PaineWebber, which will keep its name as the brokerage unit of UBS, and will take on the new title of chairman of UBS North America. He said he also would spend more time on investments in private companies and would retain responsibility for the impressive collection of modern art that PaineWebber has accumulated during his tenure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marron, in a surprising admission for a man who has not had a boss in almost 20 years, nodded toward Mr. Ospel, saying, ''I will be working for him.'' Mr. Marron declined to say what he would receive in the buyout, but the value of the stock, restricted shares and options he owns could exceed $200 million.</p>
        <p>Joseph Grano, PaineWebber's president, will run the brokerage and money-management units of the combined companies in the United States. Yesterday, Mr. Grano said that he did not intend to change the firm's strategy of aiming at what it calls the ''core affluent'' customers.</p>
        <p>Last year, he said, 7 percent of the households in the United States controlled about two-thirds of the nation's investment assets, or about $12.5 trillion. By 2003, he predicted, that group will grow to include 11 percent of households that will control 78 percent of the assets, or about $24.6 billion.</p>
        <p>''That is the sweet spot of PaineWebber,'' Mr. Grano said. ''That is where we have focused our efforts more than any other place.''</p>
