        <p>St. Martin's Press, another unit of Holtzbrinck in the United States, will publish other books bearing the New York Times brand, like The Times's crossword puzzle books. St. Martin's will also distribute other books published by The New York Times. The Times has previously published hotel, restaurant and museum guides as well as yearbooks about the Yankees and a photographic history of Times Square.</p>
        <p>The Times Company, a diversified media company that also owns The Boston Globe, began publishing books in 1969, when it acquired Quadrangle Books, based in Chicago. In 1977, the company changed its imprint to Times Books. From 1984 through 1999, the Times licensed the imprint to Random House. The imprint ceased publication when the license agreement expired in December 1999.</p>
