      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A startling photograph has surfaced showing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey grinning while frisking a black man who has his hands up and is facing a wall. The picture was taken on a night in 1996 when she accompanied state troopers who were patrolling in Camden. The man she frisked had apparently already been searched by the troopers for weapons and drugs and then handed over to the governor. The man had not been accused of any crime.</p>
        <p>The picture has caused a furor, and Mrs. Whitman is now criticizing her critics for taking the picture ''out of context.'' But the fact remains that the posed look of the photograph and Mrs. Whitman's smiling expression add up to the appearance of a gratuitous insult. The controversy over the photo may also help explain why Mrs. Whitman has had so much trouble putting the political problem of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers behind her.</p>

        <p>A startling photograph has surfaced showing Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey grinning while frisking a black man who has his hands up and is facing a wall. The picture was taken on a night in 1996 when she accompanied state troopers who were patrolling in Camden. The man she frisked had apparently already been searched by the troopers for weapons and drugs and then handed over to the governor. The man had not been accused of any crime.</p>
        <p>The picture has caused a furor, and Mrs. Whitman is now criticizing her critics for taking the picture ''out of context.'' But the fact remains that the posed look of the photograph and Mrs. Whitman's smiling expression add up to the appearance of a gratuitous insult. The controversy over the photo may also help explain why Mrs. Whitman has had so much trouble putting the political problem of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers behind her.</p>
        <p>One reason the issue will not disappear is that racial profiling -- the targeting and searching of motorists based solely on race -- has gone on for years, despite denials by political leaders like Mrs. Whitman. Also, the anger and mistrust in minority communities over this issue are deeply rooted, despite Mrs. Whitman's subsequent acknowledgment of the problem and her efforts to deal with it.</p>
        <p>The photograph simply feeds that anger and mistrust. Mrs. Whitman insists the episode had nothing to do with racial profiling. But that does not change the fact that the man in the picture was treated callously by the person who is chiefly responsible for setting the direction and tone of law enforcement in the state.</p>
        <p>To be fair, Mrs. Whitman was the first New Jersey governor to acknowledge that state troopers had engaged in systematic racial profiling. In the past year she began efforts to combat profiling as part of a consent decree entered into between the state and the Justice Department. She has also conceded that state police commanders have tolerated racial and sexual discrimination against minority and female officers. In the face of numerous lawsuits brought by former state troopers, she has ordered an overhaul of the agency's hiring and promotion practices and its command structure.</p>
        <p>But those bureaucratic reforms do not take the sting out of the photo. Mrs. Whitman's refusal to apologize for the conduct in the photo adds to public skepticism that her administration will energetically crack down on illegal policing practices. A lawyer for two troopers who have been criminally charged for shooting three unarmed minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike has already said the photo will be used to support their contention that racial profiling was encouraged by the police leadership. If the governor cares to heal the mistrust, she needs to show that she understands why the picture is offensive to so many people.</p>
