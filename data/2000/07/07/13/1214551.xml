        <p>Drew Henson learned he now is property of the Reds, as the result of the Denny Neagle trade, when called yesterday morning by Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president of baseball operations. Newman said Henson reacted like most players traded for the first time, expressing disappointment and sadness.</p>
        <p>Unlike most players, however, Henson doesn't have to embrace the trade. He could quit baseball altogether and pursue his football career. Henson is set to be the quarterback at the University of Michigan. He was already scheduled to leave his minor league assignment with the Yankees Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>Henson will take some time to consider all of his options, including playing football full-time. ''I don't know if he really wants to take that stance yet,'' said Casey Close, Henson's agent. ''He wants to take a day and absorb everything. That would really change the whole playing field, but at the same time, it's certainly an option. But it's not something we've talked about.''</p>
        <p>Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager, said: ''That's the risk we take as far as him being in the trade. We think it's a high-risk, high reward situation for us.''</p>
        <p>If Henson gave up baseball, the Reds would not likely get any adjustment in the trade.</p>
