        <p>The bishops of the Episcopal Church, acting on the most contentious issue facing their denomination's General Convention, voted late today to reject a proposal that church officials develop rites to bless relationships between couples living together outside marriage, rituals that would probably be particularly applied to gay relationships.</p>
        <p>The vote, with 85 bishops against the proposal and 63 supporting it, came after more than three hours of debate, during which several of the prelates gathered here warned that were the proposal to pass, it could threaten the unity of the 2.4 million-member denomination, so severe are divisions among Episcopalians over what recognition to extend to gay and lesbian parishioners.</p>
        <p>Bishop Ed Little of the Diocese of Northern Indiana said he did not support the proposal ''because it will deepen our divisions.'' But another prelate, Catherine Roskam, a suffragan or auxiliary bishop of New York, called for supporting the development of the rites, saying, ''We have been pioneers in the ordination of women and we can be pioneers in this.''</p>
        <p>The bishops' vote was the second time in two days that church leaders have rejected the proposal that an Episcopalian commission develop rites to be considered and voted upon at the next convention, which will be held in 2003. The convention, held every three years, is the church's top policy-making body, divided into two separate chambers, one composed of bishops, the other of clergy and lay people who are called ''deputies.'' On Tuesday, at the meeting at the Denver Convention Center, the House of Deputies voted against the proposal, but by a narrow margin.</p>
        <p>The proposal for the rites originally appeared as the eighth paragraph in an unusual resolution on sexuality that has been under consideration at the convention. After the deputies deleted that controversial paragraph, they overwhelmingly approved the resolution and sent it on to the bishops to consider.</p>
        <p>The resolution states that the church officially acknowledges that among the people in its pews are unmarried couples living in long-term relationships. It adds that although such relationships depart from traditional Christian teaching on sexuality, the church should give the couples involved its pastoral care and ''prayerful support.'' The statement makes no distinction between heterosexual and homosexual relationships -- and so implicitly includes both.</p>
        <p>The bishops have yet to vote on the resolution itself, although in their debate many expressed support for it, without the controversial eighth paragraph. The resolution is a carefully nuanced document, deploring promiscuity, declaring that Episcopalian leaders ''expect'' that nonmarital relationships will be monogamous and also noting that the church teaches that marriage is sanctified.</p>
        <p>The bishops' vote today centered on whether to amend the resolution to re-attach the eighth paragraph that the House of Deputies had rejected. Had that passed, the question would have been placed again before the House of Deputies, which could either re-affirm its earlier vote or change it.</p>
        <p>When they reconvene on Thursday, the bishops will consider another amendment to the resolution on whether a church commission should try in the next three years to find out whether it is possible to develop a theological basis for the blessing of relationships outside marriage.</p>
        <p>The broader question of how far a church should go in recognizing gay relationships is highly controversial among Episcopalians and many other Protestant denominations. Two weeks ago, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) passed an amendment to its constitution that would prohibit ministers from officiating at same-sex unions. The amendment must ratified by a two-thirds majority of the church's regional jurisdictions within the next year if it is to become law.</p>
