        <p>Bozart Toys of Philadelphia is introducing a modern dollhouse ($200) with furniture by contemporary designers. The dining room set (right, $22) is by Dakota Jackson, the living room (far right, $22) includes pieces by Karim Rashid, Ron Arad and Keiser-Newman. Bathroom fixtures ($22 for the set) are green porcelain, and an art collection ($15 each) has photographs by Laurie Simmons and Cindy Sherman, and sculpture by Mel Kendrick. The family is modeled on Ms. Simmons and the architect Peter Wheelwright, who designed the house; his son; and her daughter. Due next month at Mxyplyzyk, 125 Greenwich Avenue (13th Street).</p>
