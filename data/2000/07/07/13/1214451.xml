        <p>LAST year Lance Armstrong, of Austin, Tex., won the grueling Tour de France bicycle race after recovering from a brush with death from testicular cancer. Despite the attention Mr. Armstrong received, the United States remains one of the few places on earth where cycling fans can't get live television broadcasts of all 21 races that make up the Tour this year. That may be just as well. The time difference between here and France means that depending on where you are, catching an entire daily stage of the three-week Tour live would mean losing sleep or skipping work.</p>
        <p>But for cycling fans, temptation lurks in the form of the World Wide Web. Although it doesn't offer live video of cycling's most important race, at least one site has live audio in English and many others offer up-to-the-minute text reports. For those patient enough to wait until the action is over each day, the best Web sites for the race shame traditional American media in terms of the completeness of their information.</p>
        <p>The Societe du Tour de France was one of cycling's first governing bodies to use the Web. It remains the master. The most prominent feature of the site (www.letour.fr/2000/us) is a stream of text reports updating the race while it is underway. The updates are largely based on reports from spotters in cars and on motorcycles who travel close to the action. Known as Radio Tour, this system is the main source of information for nearly everyone following the race.</p>
        <p>Details of the route, a three-dimensional view of the mountains and, of course, every result and race statistic are available on the site. Elaborate graphics sometimes slow downloads.</p>
        <p>A new feature allows Web spectators to share an experience formerly limited to the press corps: the daily post-race news conferences. Now the whole world can watch the goings-on through Webcasts, which are sometimes translated into English. Web visitors can't ask questions, and when they see how stilted and artificial the news conferences generally are, they may be thankful. This portion of the site promises that visitors will ''experience it like you were there.'' Unfortunately, it follows through.</p>
        <p>A particular page on the French language part of the site is worth visiting even for those who can't read a word in the language. It is a photo gallery depicting parts of the publicity caravan, a shamelessly commercial parade of often bizarre vehicles (www.letour.fr/caravane /fr). It precedes the riders by about one hour and tries to amuse one of the world's largest live, captive audiences with noise, loud music and, above all, attractive young men and women who toss out trinkets, free product samples and empty shopping bags to hold all the junk.</p>
        <p>VeloNews is the only United States-based magazine devoted to bicycle racing, as opposed to training or equipment. This year the magazine has expanded its Tour de France coverage on the Web (www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews /race/road/00tdf). The experience of the magazine staff -- the editorial director, John Wilcockson, has followed the Tour for 32 years -- is apparent in its full race reports. Unfortunately several hours sometimes pass between the end of racing and their appearance. The site also offers the same updated race reports found at the official Tour de France site.</p>
        <p>Not all VeloNews journalists are professional writers. Three American professional riders in the race -- Tyler Hamilton, a teammate of Mr. Armstrong; Fred Rodriguez; and Chann McRae -- take turns producing a behind-the-scenes diary for the site. Mr. Hamilton, the most successful cyclist of the trio, is also the most promising writer.</p>
        <p>Although no one offers streaming video of the live race, Eurosport (tour2000.eurosport.com/home.asp ?LangueID=2) at least has a poor man's substitute. While the race is in progress, the satellite sports channel gives a streaming feed of the audio portion of its broadcasts. To reach it, users click on a button marked Radio Tour. Its English language television broadcast is mainly viewed in the United Kingdom, so the coverage pays particular -- sometimes excessive -- attention to riders from that country.</p>
        <p>Of course, TV without pictures has limitations. The early and ultimately meaningless portions of nonstrategic stages seem even more tedious without views of the attractive French countryside to pass the time. When something does happen, it can be frustrating to listen to Eurosport's announcers pick apart something from an invisible video replay.</p>
        <p>But this is as close to a live broadcast as Americans can get. The expert commentary on many stages is provided by Sean Kelly, a retired Irish rider who was once a leading Tour sprinter. Unfortunately, one famous (and very plausible) cycling legend is that the taciturn Mr. Kelly once shook his head to answer yes or no during a radio interview.</p>
        <p>A small daily video highlight package is also available. Its viewers might first want to turn their speakers off. The soundtrack is always a jarring mix of screams from the crowd and European disco music.</p>
        <p>The Web site of Lance Armstrong's United States Postal Service cycling team (www.uspsprocycling .com) offers two daily race reports. One is written by a team official, the other by a public affairs person from the sponsor. Neither is among the best reports available on the Web, but the site does have some interesting features, like the detailed description of a team bike by one of the  team's mechanic, Geoff Brown, who also offers an essay on the mechanic's role in racing. There is also an excerpt from Mr. Armstrong's autobiography.</p>
        <p>Far more elaborate is Nike's Tour site, which is reached through the company's home page (www.nike .com), a sponsor of Mr. Armstrong and the supplier of his team's clothing. In addition to the usual daily stage reports, which focus mostly on Mr. Armstrong's analysis, the site has a number of video and multimedia features. That means that downloads can be taxing at dial-up modem speeds.</p>
        <p>The Tour de France began in 1903 as a publicity gimmick for the newspaper L'Auto, a predecessor of L'Equipe, a daily sports newspaper based in Paris. The yellow leader's jersey that Mr. Armstrong hopes to wear into Paris on July 23 is colored to match the paper on which both newspapers were once printed.</p>
        <p>The race and the newspaper are operated separately today but are part of the same corporate group. And no organization in the world covers the Tour as thoroughly as L'Equipe. For all the race participants, including the riders, it is the final word on the Tour.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately the newspaper's site (www.lequipe.fr) is costly by Web standards. Once users register by setting up an awkward online debit account, they can spend 1 Euro (about 95 cents) to buy the right to view a specific issue of the paper electronically for up to seven days.</p>
        <p>Dealing with L'Equipe's awkward online purchasing process is the least of most people's problems, because the site is written in French. But for cycling fans who read French or have a willing human translator or a reliable electronic one, there is no more complete Tour source.</p>
