        <p>INTO every dark loft, a lot of light can fall. When Dr. Tilman Friedrich and his wife, Carlota Vollhardt, bought their 2,500-square-foot TriBeCa loft in 1998, they chose it for its location. It was in an 1860 building, once a warehouse for cheese and eggs, on a street graced with a triangular park. Moreover, their favorite restaurants were only a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>There was, however, just one thing wrong. Like many lofts, apartments and town houses, their loft had windows only at each end (north and south), and darkness in between.</p>
        <p>But the couple had an idea: a marble wall that would make the light pouring in from the three south-facing windows dance halfway down the loft, from early morning into the afternoon.</p>
        <p>''Originally, the idea was a backlit onyx wall,'' said Dr. Friedrich, a cardiologist who works for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, who added that the idea of the wall came from his friend, Uwe Drapper, an architect in Berlin. ''But I thought onyx walls were like the walls of Chinese restaurants.'' He and his wife, an organizational psychologist, also with Pfizer, prefer a crisp, clean modernist aesthetic. They like their clothes black, their walls white and their chairs by Mies van der Rohe.</p>
        <p>The loft is partly a pied-a-terre. Dr. Friedrich works in Manhattan, while Ms. Vollhardt commutes between Pfizer offices in New York and Groton, Conn. Although they have a house on Long Island Sound, they are profoundly urban. ''Before Groton, we have always been in cities,'' Dr. Friedrich said.  When they were students in Berlin, they lived in an industrial loft, complete with a bar. In TriBeCa, they wanted to replicate the loft and bar, but without the restrictions of a student budget. After all, this is a couple  who dine at Chanterelle and Danube on a  monthly basis.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a marble wall, something quiet but strong,'' Dr. Friedrich said. ''We wanted a large living area because we love to cook.''  He is the kind of weekend chef who makes  sauces from stock reductions involving beef bones roasted then simmered for hours on end. Her specialty is pastry.</p>
        <p>They both love stone, and they wanted it on counters, bar and kitchen floor. And they wanted everything suffused with light. So when they hired Clifton Balch and Mojdeh Baratloo, of Baratloo-Balch Architects in Manhattan, they didn't have a wish list. They had a must-do list.</p>
        <p>Together, the architects and clients chose a white Alabama marble, whose beautiful veins, in shades of charcoal darkening to black, look like a Chinese brush painting.  Mr. Balch took Polaroids of the 23 slabs of  3/4-inch marble and handed them to Dr. Friedrich, who rearranged the Polaroids, as in a game of Solitaire, until he had exactly the effect he wanted. ''We tried the marble two ways, polished and also honed for a matte finish,'' Ms. Baratloo said. ''It's the polished nature that reflects the light and brings out the pattern.''</p>
        <p>The steel-framed wall has three flush doors, which open onto two home offices and a bathroom between. Each door -- solid wood, clad in marble and steel -- weighs 450 pounds. The workmanship is so fine that the doors glide open, smoothly and silently.</p>
        <p>To maximize the light, the architects designed a clerestory above the seven-foot-high, 60-foot-long marble wall, so that sunlight travels along the ceiling. Recessed fluorescent lighting beneath the clerestory makes the ceiling glow at night. The architects also designed a translucent acid-etched glass door for the bedroom at the southern end of the loft. Open or closed, the door allows light to travel down the hall.</p>
        <p>The couple now inhabit a bright new box inside an old brick shell. ''All the new materials are rich and sleek,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''and the old ones are rough.''</p>
        <p>Just as the rear of the loft is private, the front is designed to be a place where friends can perch at the granite-covered kitchen counter, perhaps peeling potatoes while their host poaches sea bass. Or they can sit at the 1950's-inspired curvy bar, a collaboration between the architects and the clients.  ''Everything is hard-edged, and this is curvilinear,'' Mr. Balch said. To Ms. Vollhardt, the bar is more than a curve tucked into a rectangle. ''It's about playfulness,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Granite was chosen for bar and countertop because it is tougher than marble, and they found some with a sinuous pattern. The Bulthaup kitchen system, imported from Germany, is so precisely engineered it looks like a NASA space station, with the equally precise Dr. Friedrich at the controls. The kitchen floor is a soapstone whose deep, dusky color was chosen to complement blue-gray lacquer cabinets. Even the fireplace is crisp and pristine. The architects cut rectangles for the hearth and for the firewood, and framed them with more light-reflecting  marble.</p>
        <p>Along with the luxury of light is the warmth of wood, whether it's the larch wood cabinetry, the oak floors or Ms. Vollhardt's family heirlooms. When Ms. Vollhardt's parents traveled through Spain in the 1940's, they bought a a 15th-century table from a priest at a Renaissance church. Today, it is a coffee table in a modern loft in TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>''He didn't want to use it anymore,'' Ms. Vollhardt said, ''because it was old.''</p>
