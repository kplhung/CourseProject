        <p>Initiative Media Worldwide, the agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies that handles media services for accounts with billings estimated at more than $12 billion, is making top management changes as Larry Lamattina, the chairman and chief executive, prepares to retire, effective on Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>Louis Schultz, 55, who was hired by Mr. Lamattina in January as chairman and chief executive at Initiative Media North America in Los Angeles, will succeed Mr. Lamattina and continue in his North American posts.</p>
        <p>''When I came in, there was an indication this would happen as long as I was doing my job in North America,'' said Mr. Schultz, who before joining Initiative Media held top posts at two Interpublic units in Warren, Mich., Campbell-Ewald and C-E Communications.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamattina, 54, became chairman and chief executive in January 1999 as he helped Interpublic merge Western International Media, which focused on North America, with Initiative Media Worldwide, which concentrated on Europe.</p>
        <p>Before that, he held top posts at the Allied Communications Group unit of Interpublic, All American Television, E.C. Television, Lintas Worldwide and Grey Adverising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamattina, who has been based in New York, said he planned to devote his time to raising money with his wife for charities in their hometown of Weston, Conn.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Schultz is promoted, Marie-Jose Forissier, the chairwoman and chief executive for Initiative Media Europe, Asia and Latin America, will take the new post of president and chief operating officer at Initiative Media as she assumes more responsibilities for the United States operations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Forissier, now based in Paris, will divide her time between Paris and New York.</p>
        <p>Michael Lotito continues as president and chief operating officer at Initiative Media North America in New York.</p>
