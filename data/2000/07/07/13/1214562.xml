        <p>Drivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline at Kenneth Cerny's service station as they did a few years ago, but Mr. Cerny is a poorer man for it.</p>
        <p>His Cerny's Midway Market sells gas under the Citgo brand in Mukwonago, Wis., where prices soared to over $2 a gallon last month after pipeline problems and new federal clean-fuel rules crimped Midwest supplies. Customers have been furious. ''All they understand is what they see at the gas pump,'' Mr. Cerny said.</p>
        <p>But the price he pays for his gasoline has risen faster than the price he can charge customers and still stay competitive, he said. For many independent operators, who own most of the country's service stations and convenience stores, rising gas prices have brought little benefit, and in some regions they have actually made it tougher to do business.</p>
        <p>But elsewhere along the chain that takes oil from the ground to the filling station, higher prices have meant sharply higher profits -- for producers and refiners. Major oil companies are expected to post average earnings growth of 121 percent for the three months ended in June, compared with the period last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Exploration and production companies are expected to report average increases of 371 percent. Even refiners, who have suffered through two years of very thin profits, are seeing profits double or triple.</p>
        <p>With a host of politicians, including Vice President Al Gore, demanding an investigation of ''price gouging,'' the Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into possible industry collusion.</p>
        <p>Why are profits up so sharply?</p>
        <p>Collusion by OPEC has clearly played a role. The primary reason crude oil prices have risen sharply -- the biggest factor in the leap in gasoline prices -- was the decision by the cartel's ministers in March 1999 to curtail oil production. Despite two production increases this year, and Saudi Arabia's plan to raise output by another 500,000 barrels a day, oil hovers at close to $30 a barrel, almost triple the low prices of early last year.</p>
        <p>With their costs remaining much the same but the price they're being paid for oil rising sharply, oil producing nations and companies are doing far better. For example, the largest United States oil producers generally see their profits rise about 6 percent for every $1 increase in crude oil prices, according to Bruce Lanni, an industry analyst at CIBC World Markets.</p>
        <p>An even more drastic turnabout in profits has come in the refining business, the middle step between pumping oil from the ground and pumping gas into cars. Refiners take crude oil and ''crack'' it into refined products, including gas, heating oil and jet fuel. This is done by major integrated oil companies, like Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Tex., as well as by independents, like the Valero Energy Corporation, based in San Antonio, and the Tosco Corporation, based in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>Before gas prices started their rise last year, drivers reaped the benefits of both low crude prices and slim margins for refiners. For refiners, though, it was a very painful period, as overcapacity and stiff competition cut profits, making last year the worst for the industry in more than a decade, analysts say. Refining ''is just a horrible business,'' said Paul Y. Cheng, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>But this year has brought at least temporary relief to refiners, and that is not simply because of higher oil prices. Refiners profit if the price of gas and heating oil rises faster than the price of crude. That is what happened this year, analysts say, as strong demand and low inventories allowed refiners to sell their product on the spot market at higher and higher prices, which were then passed on to the marketing companies, distributors and wholesalers that deliver gas to the pump.</p>
        <p>Refiners use the term ''crack spread'' to describe the gap between what it costs them to buy crude oil and the price they get for selling gas and other refined products. As 1999 came to a close, spreads were thin, but a late blast of winter in the Northeast caused demand for heating oil to soar, lifting prices and margins.</p>
        <p>Spreads improved further during the spring, as it became clear that domestic gas inventories were quite low even as demand for gas was accelerating with the strong economy and the approach of the summer driving season. And they widened even more in May and June as low inventories, supply disruptions and the federally mandated introduction of a new type of reformulated gas caused pump prices to soar, especially in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Before, ''you had low crude prices and an oversupply, which led to cutthroat competition and a period of companies trying to liquidate inventories into a market that was oversold,'' said Arthur L. Smith, the chief executive of John S. Herold Inc., an industry researcher. ''That has reversed, and now you have high crude prices to pass through, and you can pass them through because inventories are down.''</p>
        <p>Refining margins across the United States averaged $6.64 a barrel in the second quarter, compared with $3.27 in the period last year, according to calculations by Mr. Lanni. In the Midwest, where a pipeline break and a shortage of new reformulated gas caused the worst spike in retail prices, margins averaged $9.45 a barrel for the period -- topping $17 at one point -- compared with $3.18 the year before.</p>
        <p>Spreads ''this year are better than they have ever been,'' said William E. Greehey, Valero's chief executive. ''We entered the season with low inventories, demand has been strong and distillate inventories are still very low.''</p>
        <p>Whether the oil industry is profiting excessively is a matter of debate. President Clinton, for example, has said there is ''no economic explanation'' for the surge in prices, particularly in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>But industry analysts say the industry is merely doing what many other businesses, from makers of  software to makers of sport utility vehicles, are doing: pricing aggressively and opportunistically to maximize profits.</p>
        <p>Philip K. Verleger, a senior advisor to the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm, who has served on several federal and state investigations into accusations of oil industry collusion, said past efforts to pin price-fixing charges on the industry  had had little success. ''When I served on these things, and every time I talked to F.T.C. economists, nobody can find anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After peaking three weeks ago the price of gas is now falling. Regular gas is now $1.59 a gallon -- both nationally and in the Midwest --  down from $1.68 nationally and $1.87 in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, industry officials say that while the recent drop in gas prices had caused refinery spreads to narrow in the last few weeks, a potential shortage in heating oil should keep profits strong during the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that by October, the nation needs inventories of heating oil and similar distillates of at least 135 million barrels to ensure that prices are somewhat stable during the winter. But inventories are now at 109 million barrels, and with many refiners still focused on capturing the wide spreads from gas, it is not certain that heating oil inventories will reach more normal levels by the time cold weather arrives. And since the price of natural gas has also risen sharply this year, that is expected to add to demand for heating oil.</p>
        <p>''The market is so tight right now that any refinery that goes down is going to cause a disruption,'' Mr. Greehey said, ''and if we have any kind of winter, we're going to see people complaining about fuel oil prices like they were complaining about gas prices in the Midwest.''</p>
        <p>The recent drop in wholesale gas prices has brought some relief to service station and convenience store owners, but it may be a while before they recover from the whipsawing they suffered in May and June, when wholesale prices soared.</p>
        <p>In March and early April, many retailers enjoyed widening margins as wholesale prices fell. But that reversed quickly, and their margins contracted severely across much of the nation, especially in the Midwest and West Coast.</p>
        <p>The average national wholesale price of regular gas leaped 37 cents, to $1.19 a gallon, between April 13 and June 22, according to the Oil Price Information Service, which tracks gas prices. Over the same time, the average retail pump price rose just 15 cents, to $1.65. Owners of service stations say that their business is too competitive to enable them to pass all their price increases to customers immediately.</p>
        <p>''On the way up, retail tends to lag, so in a fast-rising market a retailer can get really squeezed,'' said Kevin J. Lindemer, who tracks refining at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ''When the market starts to fall, it depends on how aggressive the competition is, you can recover a little bit of that margin, but that's not always the case.''</p>
        <p>Service station and convenience store owners have had to contend with other problems. For example, in regions of the nation where station owners shy away from requiring drivers to prepay, the number of ''drive-offs'' has soared, according to industry associations, as customers apparently feel more justified stealing gas. Bill Douglas, who owns nine service stations and runs a gasoline distribution company in Sherman, Tex., has been losing $1,000 a month in drive-offs recently at his largest stations. In at least five states, new laws have gone into effect this year requiring people who repeatedly steal gas to lose their license.</p>
        <p>And service station owners are being squeezed in other ways: with gas prices so much higher, the value of a typical station's inventory has soared, making it more costly to finance. Many gas credit cards often charge 3 percent of the transaction amount as a fee, so station owners are paying more in credit card fees.</p>
        <p>''Everybody that I meet thinks I'm getting rich. They say, 'I bet you're really enjoying these high prices,' '' Mr. Douglas said. ''But cashiers take the brunt of it. They get insulted regularly.''</p>
