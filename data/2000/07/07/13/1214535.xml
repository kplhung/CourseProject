        <p>Making a pre-emptive strike for the best pitcher available, the Yankees shipped a ransom in top prospects to the Cincinnati Reds yesterday for the left-hander Denny Neagle, a two-time All-Star whose style of pitching makes him perfectly suited to the dimensions of Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scrambled to find quality pitching just two weeks ago, but now their rotation is overstocked with six veteran starters -- Orlando Hernandez, Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Neagle, David Cone and Dwight Gooden -- for five spots. Gooden, who pitched five solid innings against the Mets Saturday and seemingly earned a chance for more starts, will be moved to the bullpen to work in long relief.</p>
        <p>In return for the 31-year-old Neagle, who was 8-2 with a 3.52 E.R.A. for the Reds, the Yankees paid sticker price: Drew Henson, a power-hitting Class AA third baseman and the quarterback for the University of Michigan who has not decided whether he will ultimately play baseball or football professionally; Jackson Melian, the Yankees' most prominent outfield prospect; the left-hander Ed Yarnall, who struggled when given chances to establish himself in the rotation; and Brian Reith, a Class A pitcher. The Yankees also received the minor league outfielder Mike Frank, a fringe prospect.</p>
        <p>The Reds had been expected to contend for the championship this season, after acquiring Ken Griffey Jr. But they are 43-44, eight games behind the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Central. The trade of Neagle, their ace, signals their intent to retool for 2001.</p>
        <p>Neagle will be eligible for free agency after this season, but the Yankees initiated negotiations yesterday on a long-term deal with Neagle, who could end up with a contract akin to the four-year, $36 million agreement recently reached by Minnesota's Brad Radke.</p>
        <p>''I'm definitely open-minded to signing,'' said Neagle, who will join the Yankees tomorrow and who will likely pitch Monday against the Phillies. ''You'd be foolish not to entertain offers from the Yankees. Let's put it this way; they were definitely on my short list of teams to entertain offers from after the season.''</p>
        <p>According to Barry Meister, Neagle's agent, the Yankees ''indicated they gave up good players and would like Denny long term. I would expect to have substantive discussions sooner rather than later.''</p>
        <p>Neagle is in the last year of a multiyear deal that pays him $4.75 million this season. A clause in Neagle's current contract provides that he will be paid $250,000 in the event he is traded, and the Yankees will pay that sum.</p>
        <p>In less than two weeks, the Yankees have added the slugger David Justice and Neagle, and although they will seek a veteran to help fill the void created by Shane Spencer's season-ending knee injury -- someone like Chad Curtis -- the major part of the midseason makeover is completed. ''We're trying to win this year,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager. ''We've been careful about maintaining our farm system, but we're going for it right now.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had been told repeatedly by the Phillies that Curt Schilling was not available, and given Schilling's symbolic importance to the franchise and his relatively low salary of $6.5 million for next year, Yankees executives never believed that was going to change. Mike Mussina is a free agent, but has a no-trade clause and has told the Orioles flatly he will veto any proposed deal.</p>
        <p>Neagle was the top-rated pitcher on the Yankees' list of prospective trade targets. About 10 days ago, after Cincinnati lost a series against St. Louis, Reds General Manager Jim Bowden called Cashman and asked whether the Yankees were interested in Neagle.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Cashman replied. Bowden dispatched the assistants Bob Boone and Al Goldis to scout the Yankees' farm system, and told Cashman that he would call with names of prospects he wanted.</p>
        <p>In the interim, Henson was again asked if he would be willing to give up his football career to play baseball, but Yankees executives knew he wasn't ready to answer the question. Henson is set to be the starter for Michigan this fall, and it seemed unlikely he would change his mind after two years of working toward that. Henson indicated, again, that he hadn't made a decision about which sport he wanted to play.</p>
        <p>Tuesday morning, Bowden called Cashman with the names of the prospects: Henson and Melian were at the top of his list. The Yankees paid significant signing bonuses to both, but doubts about each player have surfaced -- Henson, because he might play football, and Melian, because of his long swing and propensity for strikeouts.</p>
        <p>The Yankees responded quickly, wanting to complete a deal swiftly, sure in their assessment that Neagle was, far and away, the best pitcher on the market, knowing that if they haggled and dragged out negotiations, Bowden would be more likely to look seriously at other offers.</p>
        <p>''If you haggle,'' Cashman said yesterday, ''then you have to be prepared for the fact that the player is going to go to another team.''</p>
        <p>Cashman and Bowden spoke about a dozen times on Tuesday, and into yesterday morning, settling on three prospects: Henson, Melian, and Yarnall. With the Reds concerned about Henson's intentions, the Yankees agreed to give a fourth player, which turned out to be Reith. The Yankees were in a position to trade prospects because they never agreed to the Cubs' demands for Sammy Sosa.</p>
        <p>Bowden called Cashman at about 10:45 yesterday morning and agreed to the trade. The Yankees landed the left-hander they wanted. And, in doing so, by moving swiftly and agreeing to pay Cincinnati's demands, they kept him away other potential suitors, such as the Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox and Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>Neagle is 14-2 since the end of last August, with a career record of 98-62. He won 16 games in 1996 for Pittsburgh and Atlanta, 20 games for the Braves in 1997 and 16 games for Atlanta in 1998. He had some weakness in the muscles of his rotator cuff in 1999 and was limited to only 19 starts, but he rebounded this year.</p>
        <p>Neagle's style is much like that of Atlanta's Tom Glavine, mixing a fastball of about 87 to 89 miles an hour and a breaking ball, and a phenomenal changeup.</p>
        <p>''I know he's going to help them,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy said. ''He's got three great pitches. He's like Glavine, uses his breaking ball a little bit more, pitches inside with his fastball a little more. Tony Gwynn said he's one of the two toughest pitchers he's ever faced, and the other is Randy Johnson.''</p>
        <p>Neagle generates an extraordinarily high ratio of fly balls, which means he will fit in well in spacious Yankee Stadium. He allowed only one run in seven and two-thirds innings in his only start in Yankee Stadium, in 1997. ''Lefties have always had great success in that ballpark,'' Neagle said. ''With the deep center field and deep alleys, that's going to suit me well.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees assigned SHANE SPENCER to the 60-day disabled list because of his torn anterior cruciate ligament, and sent DARRELL EINERTSON to Class AAA Columbus. The San Diego Padres claimed TODD ERDOS off waivers from the Yankees.</p>
