        <p>The day was winding down on Tuesday, and life on State Street in Brooklyn unfolded as it would on just about any July evening.</p>
        <p>In his garden apartment at 428 State Street, Noel Rosenbower watered the plants and then braised a rabbit for a small birthday party on his backyard patio. Karen Richter, at 397 State Street, got ready to watch a video, ''Double Jeopardy,'' so she could return the movie on time later that night.</p>
        <p>There was also the Saturday block party to prepare for, and some of the neighbors, with organizational help from Harriet Walit, a retired social worker known as the den mother of the Boerum Hill block, were shopping for the event.</p>
        <p>Then, about 7, Mrs. Walit and her husband, Leonard, returning from a day trip to Connecticut, stopped to help Andreas and Maria Sassos at No. 422 get their baby into their car. They then walked in the front door of their three-story house at 420 State Street, smelled gas and called over to Julian Jackson's house next door, at 418 State Street. Khay Cochran, 73 years old, Mr. Jackson's companion, went over to check.</p>
        <p>About 7:45, in a stroke of arbitrary and nightmarish bad luck, the Walits' town house was blown to bits by a thunderous explosion, apparently caused by a gas leak, trapping the couple and Mr. Cochran inside. Mr. Jackson was rescued before his house all but collapsed, and he spent most of the next 20 hours huddled on the sidewalk staring out at the rubble in silence, waiting for firefighters to dig out the bodies.</p>
        <p>Shortly before noon yesterday, they discovered the body of Mr. Walit buried under tons of rubble in the basement of his town house. Eight hours later, they found Mr. Cochran. And at 11:10 p.m., rescue workers recovered the body of Mrs. Walit. [Page B6.]</p>
        <p>Much was lost or damaged in the sudden swirl of dust and screams: three lives, an urban evening's sense of calm, and a broad feeling of optimism for a block that had climbed back from years of edgy unease to become a street of restored elegance and real community. It was hard, then, for Mr. Jackson and his neighbors, as they spent yesterday roaming the block, monitoring the fruitless rescue efforts and crying in each other's arms, not to feel that one stunningly horrific moment had changed everything on the block.</p>
        <p>''We're wiped out,'' Mr. Rosenbower said. ''This is unbelievable. We all know each other. In New York, you don't know your neighbor. Around here, we know exactly who the neighbors are.''</p>
        <p>And the Walits in particular had helped form a fabric that made one city block, between Nevins and Bond, a small town.</p>
        <p>''They were at the heart of it, they really were,'' Mr. Rosenbower said.</p>
        <p>The couple moved onto the block in 1970, at a time when anyone moving in had to be willing to inhabit a treeless street filled with dilapidated buildings and to rebuild, restore and make their places livable.</p>
        <p>Residents chipped in to buy maple trees and flowering plants that now dot the block, a serene oasis in a gritty pocket of Brooklyn, close to downtown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson, 78, a retired lawyer, said he bought 418 State Street in 1963, when it was just a shell of a structure with no front stoop. He said he gradually rebuilt it for 10 years before moving in with Mr. Cochran, his partner of 53 years, and then filling it with so much artwork and antiques that neighbors referred to it as a museum and frequently took informal tours.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Walit, who turned 66 last Sunday and celebrated her birthday with a few friends from the block at the Brooklyn Diner nearby, had retired as a school social worker for the Board of Education. Mr. Walit, 72, was an accountant and, according to friends and family, a history buff and avid reader.</p>
        <p>Much of the Walits' lives, according to friends, revolved around the block -- keeping it safe, planning block parties and other events.</p>
        <p>Both only children, the Walits had no children of their own. Mrs. Walit served on the board of Stepping Stone, a halfway house in the neighborhood, and volunteered for the Salvation Army. Over the years, the two had served both in the Central State Block Association and on the Boerum Hill Association, a neighborhood group.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they would complain to friends about drug dealers on the corner or worry out loud about a drug treatment center, Daytop, that opened up a few doors down. But they stuck it out, even as some people moved away and others took their place. Friends said the couple's commitment to the block was like a motor that propelled the broader neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''They were the mom and pop of the neighborhood,'' said Ralph Almeida, 34, an artist who lives at 430 State Street.</p>
        <p>And when newcomers arrived to the neighborhood, it was usually Mrs. Walit who acted as a one-woman welcoming committee. Last year, Sonia Majeed opened a hair salon for black women on Bond Street, at the end of the block. Immediately, Mrs. Walit began having her hair styled at the salon and was the only white customer, Ms. Majeed said. She helped plant a tree in front of the store and she would share her doughnuts and coffee and trinkets from the couple's trips to New Orleans and other places, Ms. Majeed said.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to constantly be looking out my window for her,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Walits were close with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Cochran, who shared their three-story town house  with a friend, Francis Aguire, who was leaving the house just minutes before Tuesday's explosion. Mr. Aguire, after running back inside to find Mr. Jackson, escaped safely. The four or five of them often dined or went to the theater together and shared a love of gardens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran, who met Mr. Jackson in 1946 when the two were substituting one night as extras at the Metropolitan Opera, was trying to make it as an opera singer, Mr. Jackson said. Mr. Jackson is a retired lawyer, who served as an assistant corporation counsel for the city from 1962 to 1989.</p>
        <p>They had an apartment in Manhattan, but they spent much of their time on State Street in what Mr. Jackson called his ''country home.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Jackson, who had spent most of the night sitting on the sidewalk in a wooden chair borrowed from Public School 369 across the street, watched rescue workers sift through the Walits' belongings -- clothes, history books, magazines -- and then dig through the scraps that were left of his artwork and antiques.</p>
        <p>''Over 50 years of living, I had beautiful antiques,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''Today I have not even a toothbrush.''</p>
        <p>By 8:30 a.m, hours before the first body was recovered, he had given up hope that his companion would be found alive. ''I'm not sure I want to survive,'' he said. ''We've been together over 50 years. I've never contemplated not living with him.''</p>
        <p>Twelve hours later, as Mr. Cochran's body was taken from the wreckage, Mr. Jackson was still watching from the sidewalk. Neighbors stood with him, patted his shoulder, and spoke of how the explosion had rocked the house just as Mr. Cochran had gone to give aid.</p>
        <p>Disaster, the neighbors concluded, had found State Street and ruptured it when its residents were doing what they always did: helping each other.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 19, 2000, Wednesday  A front-page article on Thursday about community spirit on the Brooklyn block that was the scene of a fatal explosion referred incorrectly to three neighbors of Leonard and Harriet Walit, the couple who died. A baby whom the Walits had helped move into a car was with Melanie Morton, not with a couple from the block. And the couple's names are Andreas Killen and Marie Sacco, not Andreas and Maria Sassos.</p>
