        <p>In a stinging decision, a state judge ruled yesterday that the Giuliani administration must arrange for the continuing mental health care of thousands of inmates before they are released from the Rikers Island jail, and not ''drop them in the middle of the night at a subway station with $3 in tokens or MetroCard fare.''</p>
        <p>The decision granted a preliminary injunction and gave class action status to a suit filed against the city last August by Brad H. and six other mentally ill inmates of the jail, who contend that the 25,000 inmates who are treated for mental illness each year while in Rikers were being released without proper provision for treatment in the community or a way to continue their psychotropic medication.</p>

        <p>In a stinging decision, a state judge ruled yesterday that the Giuliani administration must arrange for the continuing mental health care of thousands of inmates before they are released from the Rikers Island jail, and not ''drop them in the middle of the night at a subway station with $3 in tokens or MetroCard fare.''</p>
        <p>The decision granted a preliminary injunction and gave class action status to a suit filed against the city last August by Brad H. and six other mentally ill inmates of the jail, who contend that the 25,000 inmates who are treated for mental illness each year while in Rikers were being released without proper provision for treatment in the community or a way to continue their psychotropic medication.</p>
        <p>The city did not dispute these facts, but argued that inmates at Rikers have no legal right to the kind of prerelease planning required for mental hospital patients under state law. The city also contended that because the seven named plaintiffs were mentally ill, they could not adequately represent a class.</p>
        <p>But in his decision, Justice Richard F. Braun of State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected the city's arguments, finding that the plaintiffs were highly likely to win the lawsuit on its merits, and that they would suffer irreparable harm unless the city was required to provide the relief they sought while the case is fought in court.</p>
        <p>''The comparative harm is greater to them than any increase in bureaucratic work and cost to defendants,'' the judge wrote. ''It is not only to their benefit to provide them with a discharge plan'' but to the benefit of all New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Judge Braun rejected the city's contention that because many of these inmates are held for less than 45 days, there would be no time to arrange for such services. Instead, he agreed with the plaintiffs that the city could plan for the release of inmates as soon as treatment began.</p>
        <p>The judge said that without such help, mentally ill inmates are likely to harm themselves and others, through substance abuse, the deterioration of their mental and physical health, homelessness, rearrest, and reincarceration. Drawing a contrast to New York City's current practices, Judge Braun noted that all inmates in Cook County, Ill., now receive discharge services, as do inmates at the Rikers Island jail who are H.I.V. positive. The judge also said that Nassau County was preparing to do the same for all its prisoners.</p>
        <p>In the New York State prison system,  most prisoners who have been treated for mental illness during their incarceration are provided on their release with a two-week supply of psychotropic medication, a two-week prescription and a referral to an outpatient mental health clinic, unless they are referred for civil commitment to a state mental hospital. About 3,000 such releases take place from prisons in New York each year, according to state figures.</p>
        <p>St. Barnabas Hospital, which is also a defendant in the lawsuit, provides medical and mental health care under a managed care subcontract with the Health and Hospitals Corporation. The contract has been plagued by disputes over the city's role in monitoring care as well as a continuing criminal investigation into possible negligence by the hospital, which has announced that it would not renew its three-year, $342 million deal when it expires in February.</p>
        <p>Thomas Crane, a senior lawyer in the city Corporation Counsel's Office, criticized Judge Braun's ruling as legally wrong and said the city would consider an appeal.</p>
        <p>He also said that discharge services are being expanded through new state financing for mental health services, and that decisions about such services should be made by the Legislature, not the court.</p>
        <p>Doug Lasdon, the director of the Urban Justice Center, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the inmates, said that though the suit would continue, ''this decision will force the city to the bargaining table.'' Earlier efforts to settle the lawsuit were rejected by city lawyers, he added.</p>
        <p>The lead plaintiff, identified by a pseudonym in the lawsuit, is a 44-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia who grew up in a psychiatric hospital and has been treated for mental illness each of 26 times he has been jailed as an adult, most recently for jumping a subway turnstile.</p>
        <p>On none of these occasions, the lawsuit contends, did anyone plan for how the man would continue to receive medication and other mental health services on his release from jail, or how he would obtain Medicaid benefits, Social Security disability payments or supportive housing.</p>
        <p>Heather Barr, a lawyer at the Urban Justice Center who is considered an expert on the mentally ill in prisons and jails, said the help the plaintiffs were seeking for inmates being released from jail included a supply of medication, referral to a psychiatrist, a bed in a shelter with mental health services and the elimination of a 45-day waiting period for those who needed immediate benefits like Medicaid and food stamps.</p>
        <p>Asked how much such services might cost city taxpayers, Ms. Barr replied: ''I think it will save them a fortune. Nothing's more expensive than the current system.''</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday what services might be provided to mentally ill inmates under the preliminary injunction. The judge asked the plaintiffs to draft an order and called for a conference ''to move this action toward a swift resolution.''</p>
