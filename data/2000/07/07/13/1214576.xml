        <p>To learn more about the Rangers, Glen Sather, the new general manager, telephoned Neil Smith, the former general manager. Three times, he left messages for Smith. ''He hasn't called me back,'' Sather said yesterday at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Ron Low, the new coach, craved the same sort of conversation with John Muckler, the former coach. ''I've talked to John twice already,'' Low said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Perhaps these exchanges reveal hints of the personalities running the dysfunctional Rangers last season. After the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive spring, Smith and Muckler were fired in part because they were not always in accord.</p>
        <p>To repair the damage, the Garden filled the void at the top with Sather,  one of the best in the National Hockey League when his Edmonton Oilers won the Stanley Cup five times from 1984 through 1990. Investing in leadership stock, the Garden this time chose an established but recently underperforming blue chip rather than a feisty, unproven dot-com.</p>
        <p>Sather will get the time and the budget to operate in the 21st century in a somewhat larger market. He probably won't undermine his coaches, the way Smith sometimes did. By hiring Low, with Ted Green and Walt Kyle as his assistants, Sather is dipping again into the well that the Rangers have pumped for a decade.</p>
        <p>His choices border on cronyism, but at least the principals know and understand each other. When Sather hired Low to coach in the minor leagues at Halifax in 1987, Sather told him: ''Some time I'm going to fire you.'' It's just business, he was suggesting; no need to hold a grudge. Perhaps someone should have taught this to Smith when he was young and impressionable and without an enemies list.</p>
        <p>Today's arrival will be Mark Messier, the former Oiler and Ranger, making his second coming to Manhattan at a morning news conference. Banished to Vancouver three summers ago, Messier left with bitterness toward Smith and Dave Checketts, the president of the Garden. Messier will turn 40 next January with his productivity diminished. But he might have enough leadership left to help right a Rangers ship that has listed badly in his absence.</p>
        <p>At the very least, making Messier the captain again will provide a graceful way to lift the burden of the job from Brian Leetch. While it would be unfair to say all the Rangers' problems for three seasons were caused by Leetch's leadership style, it is clear that his self-contained personality did not inspire the mismatched rotisserie collection that Smith threw together every summer after the Stanley Cup of 1994.</p>
        <p>Which brings up a reason for skepticism about Sather's early moves. He signed defenseman Vladimir Malakhov earlier this week as a free agent at $3.5 million per season. Messier will get more than that and Claude Lemieux, a Devil currently being wooed by the Rangers and others, will demand about the same. Smith proved, among other things, that throwing big money at veterans with no previous bond is a risky way to build a team.</p>
        <p>Malakhov, who began with the Islanders eight years ago, has marvelous talent. He is also easily frustrated and gets rattled when booed, especially by home fans. Does this ever happen at the Garden? In a joking moment yesterday, Checketts said to Low and his coaches: ''Guys, you'll find our media patient and our fans understanding.'' Some have questioned the severity of injuries that have kept Malakhov out of games. Would Messier?</p>
        <p>Because Malakhov played for the Devils in the playoffs and improved en route to the championship last month, an optimist might suggest that Malakhov has matured, and that he is about to enter his prime. A pessimist might wonder if Sather has made his first Smith-like mistake.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he has few options. Sather casually mentioned yesterday that there is ''not an awful lot of depth in the minors or in the draft,'' a backhanded swipe at his predecessor. He also mentioned changing the ''attitude'' of the roster and the need for ''getting the older guys to perform like they're capable.'' This is a more than gentle challenge to Theo Fleury, Valery Kamensky, Mike Richter, Adam Graves and Leetch.</p>
        <p>The last three are all that is left from the cup-winning team of 1994, which was led by Messier. Messier will head to the Caribbean this weekend to sail under the full moon, when the fish bite the bait better. Those who seek omens in such things might suggest that Captain Dad stop at the movies to view ''The Perfect Storm,'' a cautionary fishing yarn about hubris and trying too hard for one last big score.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps Messier should take a lesson from Diana Ross, another star who recently performed at the Garden.</p>
        <p>Although tickets sold well here, other concert dates were canceled by lack of interest. Sometimes, it is difficult to come back in middle age, even when you've once reigned supreme.</p>
