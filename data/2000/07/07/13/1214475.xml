      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Netpliance, the first company to offer a simple Internet appliance for people seeking something less than a full-fledged PC, says it is significantly upgrading its i-Opener device in preparation for a big retail push for the holiday season. But the price is quadrupling, to $399.</p>
        <p>The company, in Austin, Tex., had trouble meeting demand at the promotional price of $99, which ended June 30, and it is declaring an unusual moratorium while it catches up and revises the product line. Online orders placed today will not be filled until October, although the new i-Opener 2001 devices will be in stores by Sept. 1.</p>

        <p>Netpliance, the first company to offer a simple Internet appliance for people seeking something less than a full-fledged PC, says it is significantly upgrading its i-Opener device in preparation for a big retail push for the holiday season. But the price is quadrupling, to $399.</p>
        <p>The company, in Austin, Tex., had trouble meeting demand at the promotional price of $99, which ended June 30, and it is declaring an unusual moratorium while it catches up and revises the product line. Online orders placed today will not be filled until October, although the new i-Opener 2001 devices will be in stores by Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>The new i-Opener 2001 system, which requires a $21.95 monthly Internet service fee but no long-term service contract, adds instant messaging among i-Opener users, multiple e-mail accounts and stock quotations.</p>
        <p>At $399, plus $21.95 a month, the i-Opener is no longer significantly cheaper than a low-end PC with Internet access, and yet it has more limited features. The company is betting that customers will be willing to pay more for simplicity and ease of use.</p>
