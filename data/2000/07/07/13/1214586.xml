        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Voyeur-Cams Come to Home Furnishings'' (July 6), about Webcams that show store merchandise and shoppers, is another case of less privacy in more places. Of course, in a store you are fair game to any hidden camera or observation. As director of sales and marketing for Inforad software, I struggle with how much privacy a buyer can expect, balancing that against the need to provide service, like upgrade notices. I think that privacy and respect will become part of the long-term relationship we have with stores and other resellers. Thanks for pointing out a new wrinkle.</p>

        <p>By the way, it is no news flash that women don't get enough time to shop unless they ditch their husbands -- just ask my wife. You don't need a camera.</p>
