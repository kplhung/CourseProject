        <p>A state judge in Albany has ruled that the Giuliani administration, not the City Council, has oversight powers over cable television in New York City.</p>
        <p>The decision is the latest blow to the Council's efforts to wrest more regulatory control over the cable industry from the Giuliani administration. Council officials have asserted that state regulations require legislative approval of the lucrative agreements with cable companies. The ability to approve the agreements would have given the Council tremendous leverage over cable services and programming.</p>
        <p>But in a 20-page ruling, Justice George B. Ceresia Jr. of State Supreme Court in Albany said that the final version of cable franchising agreements that are negotiated by the administration do not require Council approval. Justice Ceresia also denied the Council's request that the city's current agreements with Time Warner Cable and Cablevision Systems Corporation be voided.</p>
        <p>Justice Ceresia wrote that the City Charter provides ''a fairly comprehensive and detailed process for the approval of franchises'' and does not ''provide for formal participation by the City Council'' other than passing authorization legislation that allows the administration to begin negotiations. The ruling, handed down July 5, was first reported Tuesday in The New York Law Journal.</p>
        <p>Rica Rinzler, a spokeswoman for the Council, whose members have expressed concern that a mayoral administration could misuse public access channels or fail to promote competition in the industry, said the Council was reviewing the decision and considering an appeal.</p>
        <p>Elaine Reiss, the general counsel of the city's Information Technology and Telecommunications Department, defended the administration's most recent agreements, saying that ''they were ahead of the curve'' in persuading cable companies to upgrade their systems and create the foundation for Internet service.</p>
        <p>The ruling means that the city's current agreements with Time Warner and Cablevision, which together own or operate all of the city's nine cable franchises, would remain. The franchise agreements, essentially licenses that allow the companies to use city streets and property to build and maintain their cable networks, are often used to obtain concessions.</p>
        <p>In return for the access, cable companies have been required to provide the city with five governmental and educational channels. The agreements are also important tools in forcing the cable companies to respond during disputes, city officials said. Most recently, Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone accused Time Warner of violating its franchise agreement with the city in May when it pulled WABC from its New York systems during a dispute with ABC's parent, the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>Justice Ceresia's ruling will not affect a handful of companies, including satellite television providers and RCN, that offer cable service on a building-by-building basis and do not use city property to run their lines.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration has not been shy about trying to use its powers over the cable industry.</p>
        <p>In 1996, when Time Warner refused to run Fox News Channel, owned by Rupert Murdoch, the administration began running it on a governmental public access channel. But it backed down after legal challenges from Time Warner, which operates Fox News Channel's competitor, CNN.</p>
        <p>It was in that climate, in 1996, that Council officials sought to get more control over the cable franchising process.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration was using authorization legislation, passed by the Council in 1993, to begin new negotiations with Time Warner and Cablevision.</p>
        <p>Council members asserted that the agreements, sent to the State Public Service Commission for review in 1998, were illegal because state regulations required approval of the governing bodies of local municipalities.</p>
        <p>But Justice Ceresia ruled that once the authorization legislation was approved, the power over such deals rested with the head of the agency responsible for cable companies: Allan H. Dobrin, the city's information technology and telecommunications commissioner.</p>
