        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the state's ranking Democrat, has long been seen as the only serious threat to James E. McGreevey's plans to be the party's next candidate for governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, narrowly lost the 1997 governor's race and is seeking the party's nomination again for next year.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the threat posed by Mr. Torricelli was only a potential one. But for the last week, the senator, a friend and longtime supporter of Mr. McGreevey, has fueled mounting speculation that he may indeed run, by saying he has been urged to do so by several party leaders and, more important, by refusing to rule it out.</p>
        <p>And now Mr. Torricelli is making the telephone calls himself, asking county Democratic leaders and others to wait for his decision before endorsing anyone for governor.</p>
        <p>''It looks like it's real, that he's seriously thinking about jumping into the race,'' said State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a fund-raiser and power broker from Middlesex County who, as one of Mr. McGreevey's most energetic supporters, has much to lose from a Torricelli candidacy.</p>
        <p>Another influential Democrat, who has been cooler to Mr. McGreevey's candidacy, said on the condition of anonymity that Senator Torricelli had been calling elected officials and others active in the party for two days, asking for their ''private personal commitment: that if he runs, he'll have their support, and not to make any public endorsements in the meantime.''</p>
        <p>Jamie Fox, a close adviser to Mr. Torricelli, confirmed that the senator was talking about a gubernatorial bid but said that he had not asked anyone for a commitment of support -- exactly. ''What he's said is, 'If I decided to run, what would your view be, and would I have your support?' '' Mr. Fox said.</p>
        <p>He said the senator had received ''enormous pressure'' to enter the governor's race. ''He has made a number of phone calls around to the political leadership in the state, and party leaders have also reached out to him,'' Mr. Fox said. ''They have raised the fact that Republicans have controlled the State House for 16 of the last 20 years, and that the party needs the strongest candidate available in order to break that hold on the State House.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox added that some New Jersey officials were looking to Senator Torricelli to repair the deep rift between Democrats in South Jersey who supported Jim Florio's failed Senate candidacy, and those in the northern and central areas of the state who backed Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>''Many leaders believe he would be the best candidate to run for governor who could unite the party and heal its divisions, and to avoid a divisive primary in the gubernatorial race,'' Mr. Fox said. Two supporters of Mr. Florio, Representative Bill Pascrell and Michael Murphy, a former Morris County prosecutor, have already expressed interest in challenging Mr. McGreevey in a primary.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Torricelli's stature as a spokesman and fund-raiser for the national Democratic Party has soared since his election in 1996 -- he is now chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee -- Mr. McGreevey has been running for governor nonstop since his 1-percentage-point loss to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey said tonight that he was aware of Mr. Torricelli's actions and called them ''clearly appropriate.''</p>
        <p>''Every individual is properly entitled to explore a feasible candidacy,'' he said. But he cautioned that it was still ''early in the process,'' and expressed confidence ''that at the end of the long day, I will again serve as standard-bearer for the Democratic Party in the 2001 gubernatorial election.''</p>
        <p>One county leader whom Mr. Torricelli called today was Charles W. Cart, the Democratic chairman in Sussex County. He refused to divulge what they had discussed, but said he did not look forward to a primary contest between the two men. ''If Torricelli decides to run,'' he said, ''it's going to be hard on a lot of people who are friendly with both McGreevey and Torricelli, of which I'm one.''</p>
