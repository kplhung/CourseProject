        <p>Motorola Inc., the telecommunications and semiconductor giant, reported strong sales and profit growth for the second quarter today that were in line with Wall Street estimates, despite lingering weakness in the sale of its cellular telephones in Europe.</p>
        <p>The company, which released its earnings after the close of regular trading, reported revenue of $9.26 billion in the second quarter, up 22 percent from $7.6 billion in the period a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations nearly doubled, to $515 million, or 23 cents a share, from $269 million, or 13 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Motorola took an after-tax charge of $316 million, or 14 cents a share, related to research and development and acquisitions completed during the quarter.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts, who had been worried about shrinking margins in the cellular telephone business, said they were pleased with the report. Though sales and profit margins were lower in Europe, analysts said Motorola seemed to have stemmed the decline and prepared for a rebound.</p>
        <p>''Net net, people should come out of this positive, with a sigh of relief,'' said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at the PaineWebber Group. ''There were concerns they were going to miss the number, and they didn't.''</p>
        <p>Shares of Motorola closed at $35.50, up $1.875. In after-hours trading, the stock slipped to $33.0625 after the earnings were reported, then bounced back to $36.25. Still, the shares are down sharply, having started the year at nearly $50, after a huge run-up over the last two years. Those share gains had been predicated on the notion that Motorola was remaking itself for the ''wired world'' and benefiting from enormous demand for microchips, digital telephones and a host of other communications devices, like cable modems.</p>
        <p>Motorola executives said today that the second-quarter report represented the eighth consecutive quarterly profit gain and was just the latest indication that the company was aggressively moving ahead.</p>
        <p>Motorola executives said sales and profits in many units were up more than 20 percent. Sales of set-top boxes and cable modems were strong; two-way radios and networking sales jumped; and semiconductor profits were up, with improved margins.</p>
        <p>''This is a pretty good story,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a spokesman at Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. ''All of our businesses are hitting it pretty well.''</p>
        <p>The company did acknowledge, however, that digital handset revenue had slipped in Europe as the company has pulled out of some lower-tiered products. Motorola is expected to offer further explanation in a conference call on Wednesday, but executives said today that profit margins in the cellular business were expected to rise to 10 percent by the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the shift in strategy had been outlined by Motorola months ago, and the report today seemed to indicate that the company was moving in the right direction.</p>
        <p>''These numbers look pretty good,'' said Greg Teets, an analyst at A. G. Edwards Inc.</p>
