        <p>Maggie Stenz letter complains that too many articles in Circuits section are about products and not about the real issues surrounding technology, including moral and ethical ones</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Many important issues about the uses of technology are raised by ''Something to Watch Over Me'' (July 6), about devices worn on the wrist to track members of groups visiting a water park, and ''Where the TV Room Meets the Road'' (June 15), about vans and cars with televisions. Are people just using technology as a replacement for spending real time with their children? And how can children learn to take care of themselves if you're watching them all the time?</p>
        <p>I used to find Circuits interesting, but it now seems to contain full-text advertisements instead of real substantive articles about technology. Most of your articles introduce some new software, hardware, Web site, game or computer company, and the tone of the articles is always overwhelmingly positive: Technology is great! The more the better! See how many places in our lives we can have technology!</p>

        <p>Circuits would have a lot more weight and substance if it dealt with real issues about technology, including moral and ethical ones, in articles that were not tied to products.</p>
