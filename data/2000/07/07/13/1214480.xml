        <p>''Fear of Fiction,'' the first film from the director Charlie Ahearn since his 1982 high-velocity documentary ''Wild Style,'' explodes with colors and random thoughts. He works to weave coincidence, twins, faith and the nourishing blast of 60's proto punk -- garage bands with the keening Farfisa organ solos that you can't shake from your head -- into the fabric of a road picture. But he doesn't quite bring it off. The grafts won't take.</p>
        <p>This is the journey of Sigrid Andersson (Melissa Leo), an almost novelist. She's still working on her opus, ''Fear of Fiction,'' and at the beginning of the movie she goes blank while giving a reading. To clear her head she decides to take a road trip and answers the ad of Red (Sam Trammell), who's driving across the country.</p>

        <p>''Fear of Fiction,'' the first film from the director Charlie Ahearn since his 1982 high-velocity documentary ''Wild Style,'' explodes with colors and random thoughts. He works to weave coincidence, twins, faith and the nourishing blast of 60's proto punk -- garage bands with the keening Farfisa organ solos that you can't shake from your head -- into the fabric of a road picture. But he doesn't quite bring it off. The grafts won't take.</p>
        <p>This is the journey of Sigrid Andersson (Melissa Leo), an almost novelist. She's still working on her opus, ''Fear of Fiction,'' and at the beginning of the movie she goes blank while giving a reading. To clear her head she decides to take a road trip and answers the ad of Red (Sam Trammell), who's driving across the country.</p>
        <p>Moments after they start, they pick up Red's identical twin brother, Tom (also played by Mr. Trammell), and the looniness begins. Sigrid is twice Red's age, but that doesn't stop her from acting just as childishly. Given to tantrums when she can't have what she wants -- like a cigarette, since the smoke makes Red sick -- she's working her way up to diva status.</p>
        <p>Red and Tom separate, and the brothers end up in different cars but on the same path. Tom hitchhikes and is picked up by Gary (Clark Johnson), who stopped just short of taking his priestly vows, and later by Albert (Penn Jillette), a motormouth obsessed with garage bands. A big man with huge hands wrapped around a tiny steering wheel, Albert riffs on music as intensely as he drives. He and Tom start bouncing off the walls of the car with the help of Albert's stash, and their drug-addled rap about relative time and speed is a howl and feels real.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jillette's gig as a performer is to pull everyone else along with him; he has his own gravitational field. ''Fabulous Failures, a moniker all punk bands should aspires to,'' he sputters about his favorite group. (The music of the fictional Failures is by Evan Lurie, with an assist from  Mr. Ahearn and Lee Ranaldo, though actual 60's garage bands like ? and the Mysterians are also on the soundtrack.)</p>
        <p>Whenever outsiders join the main characters, ''Fiction'' becomes likably trippy. Tom is also picked up by a pair of stoners, Liz (Linda Larkin) and Debbie (Annie Giobbe). ''I'm looking for someone who looks just like me, my twin,'' he explains from the back seat. Liz asks, ''How do we know you're not him?''</p>
        <p>Such moments aside, ''Fiction,'' which opens today at the Pioneer Theater at Two Boots in the East Village, is a shambles, aspiring to philosophical trajectories it couldn't possibly reach and amateurish enough that one gets lost trying to decide what is supposed to be funny. The movie isn't involving enough to make anyone care about the blurring of truth and fantasy that may, or may not, be taking place.</p>
        <p>The spiritual murk has a few high points. There's a stunning underwater rescue that could be a swim in velvety blue amniotic fluids. For the most part, though, despite glimmers of ability from Mr. Ahearn, ''Fear of Fiction'' is a washout.</p>
        <p>FEAR OF FICTION</p>
        <p>Written and directed by Charlie Ahearn; director of photography, John Foster; edited by Christina Boden; music by Evan Lurie and Lee Ranaldo; produced by Gerry Kagan and Mr. Ahearn.
