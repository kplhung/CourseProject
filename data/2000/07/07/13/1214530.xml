        <p>Three wireless communications companies moved aggressively today to secure a presence in Europe, a highly promising region for the next generation of mobile communications.</p>
        <p>Hutchison Whampoa, the huge Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the billionaire Li Ka-shing, is teaming up with NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest wireless phone company and a leader in providing Internet services over mobile phones, and with Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile phone operator, to buy up rights to offer next-generation mobile communication services in Britain, Germany, France and Belgium.</p>
        <p>The deal is another triumph for Mr. Li, who has displayed a knack for exploiting opportunities in the telecommunications market.</p>
        <p>He turned a British wireless venture, Orange P.L.C., into another fortune when he sold it to the German telecommunications conglomerate Mannesmann for stock and then watched the value of those shares soar higher still when Mannesmann was acquired by Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, the biggest wireless company, earlier this year.</p>
        <p>And today's deal is a big step toward recouping his recent, much-criticized $6.7 billion investment in a license to supply next-generation infrastructure and services to Britain. With DoCoMo and KPN investing $:2.1 billion, or $3.15 billion, in Hutchison 3G Holdings, the license holder, Mr. Li will recover almost half of the original investment, but relinquish only a 35 percent stake.</p>
        <p>Hutchison 3G, in which the parent company plans to sell shares, wants to be Europe's leading provider of third-generation mobile communications services. The license it has is the most extensive of the five granted by the British government to sell third-generation wireless in the nation's lucrative market.</p>
        <p>And supported by the extensive financial resources of Hutchison and the technical expertise of NTT DoCoMo, Hutchison 3G will be a formidable bidder for the licenses scheduled to be auctioned at the end of the month in Germany and later in France and Belgium. Various executives said today that Hutchison 3G might also bid in Italy.</p>
        <p>The alliance is one more sign that savvy telecommunications companies are trying to exert some control over the prices of licenses by banding together, reducing the number of potential bidders for any one license.</p>
        <p>Britain's auction of five licenses last spring attracted 13 bidders and raised $34 billion, which was considered a staggering amount. Contrast that with the auction process now for five licenses in the Netherlands -- which has drawn only six potential buyers with their bids to date totaling about $397 million.</p>
        <p>Hutchison withdrew from the Dutch auction last week, as did a British cable company, which said it would rather lease infrastructure from others.</p>
        <p>Governments are starting to fight back by limiting the number of licenses they will sell and establishing minimum prices, but the industry is working hard to ensure that owning next-generation licenses makes economic sense. NTT DoCoMo will pay $:1.2 billion, about $1.8 billion at current exchange rates, for a 20 percent stake in Hutchison 3G. DoCoMo already owns a 19 percent stake in Hutchison's mobile phone business in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Royal KPN, in which NTT DoCoMo holds 15 percent, will pay $:900 million, or $1.35 billion, for a 15 percent stake. KPN is one of the top bidders in the Dutch auction, at this point offering 208.5 million euros, or $196 million.</p>
        <p>Telesystem International Wireless, a Canadian mobile phone operator that teamed up with Hutchison to buy the British license, is left with an option to purchase a stake as large as 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite the downward pressure on license prices, the costs will be high in developing mobile phone systems that allow users fast access to the Internet and the ability to download video some 40 times as fast as today. Hutchison 3G will serve as a springboard for the three companies to pursue opportunities in Europe while sharing the costs of of an expensive expansion.</p>
        <p>Hutchison 3G's new ownership structure leaves its parent company as the dominant partner. It will control the majority of seats on Hutchison 3G's board and retain a 65 percent stake.</p>
