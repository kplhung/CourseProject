        <p>A PRINT media company specializing in the Asian-American market is branching out online to broaden its audience and advertising potential.</p>
        <p>Privately held aMedia, the publisher of the bimonthly aMagazine, introduced a new Web site, aOnline.com, in June. The site is part of aMedia's long-term strategy to develop a multimedia empire that would also include production and distribution of online video, film and music.</p>
        <p>Like the magazine, aOnline.com caters to the English-speaking Asian-American market, which research shows is younger, better educated, and more affluent and technology-oriented than many other ethnic groups in the United States. These qualities make Asian-Americans desirable to marketers, even though they constitute only 4 percent of the nation's total population.</p>
        <p>A recent report by Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass., found that Asian-Americans ranked higher than white Americans, African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in both income and education: Asian-Americans had a median annual household income of $65,000, and 60 percent of them were college educated. More than three-fourths were technologically inclined, also the highest rating of the four groups, while their median age was 36, the youngest of the four groups.</p>
        <p>AMedia, which has published aMagazine for 11 years, opted to go online because ''there were limitations inherent in the print product,'' said Jeff Yang, founder and chief executive. ''To create a mass medium for Asian-Americans, you have to go where they are. Seventy percent of them, 7.5 million, are online.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Yang said aMagazine had a circulation of 180,000, with advertising sales of $1.1 million last year.</p>
        <p>''We want to leverage the resources we have off-line, and address the frailties of traditional media,'' he added. ''The Internet allows interaction and feedback, flexibility and customization for advertisers, and constant contact with our readers.''</p>
        <p>AOnline contains original editorial content as well as articles from aMagazine, various chat rooms for visitors of different ages, and an electronic calendar. Online chats are also being held with Asian-American celebrities like Deepak Chopra.</p>
        <p>In addition, aOnline is developing a network of other sites of Asian-American student, civic, service and professional groups that, like aOnline, will be sold to advertisers; the Asian-Pacific American Medical Student Association, for example, is already part of it. aMedia, which has Web design and development capabilities, will help these groups build their sites, if needed, either at a reduced price or free, depending on their finances.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Yang, aMedia's next step will be to add streaming audio and video to aOnline, thus creating a multimedia, multichannel menu of options for marketers. He also eventually plans to add an e-commerce component, to sell books, music, videos, food and other items, and to expand overseas.</p>
        <p>So far, three advertisers are buying space on aOnline -- Verio, , a provider of Internet and Web-site-operating services; Ford Motor, a long-time supporter of aMagazine; and the Army. The Army began advertising in aMagazine this last spring and is running banner ads on aOnline to recruit for its active and reserve units.</p>
        <p>Sandra Nicholls, a corporate advertising executive for Ford, said her company was working with aMedia's magazine and Web site because ''the Asian market is so diverse in and of itself.</p>
        <p>''Asian-Americans are a fast-growing community, an affluent community, and aMagazine does a good job of reaching them,'' she said. ''I look at the Internet as added value.''</p>
        <p>Ford is spending $110,000 this year on advertising in both aMagazine and aOnline, a slight increase over previous expenditures.</p>
        <p>Ekaterina O. Walsh, an analyst with Forrester Research, generally praised aMedia's online business strategy.</p>
        <p>''They're on the right track when it comes to targeting Asian-Americans online, because they're significantly more likely to be there,'' she said.  ''Between Asian-Americans' significantly higher income and the fact that they're much younger, they'll also be an attractive target to advertisers. They're also more open to novelty, which will make them a good launch pad to test new products.''</p>
        <p>Len Fong, director of cross-cultural marketing for e21corp, a Fremont, Calif., marketing communications firm, said that although aMedia does face competition from older Asian-American sites like Click2Asia.com, it has ''10 years of history behind it.''</p>
        <p>''They've got good connections and know the Asian-American marketplace fairly well,'' he said. ''Their chances of success are pretty high.''</p>
        <p>For aOnline to make the most of its advertising potential, Ms. Walsh says it should create specialized Web sites on individual subjects like music or finance, perhaps joining forces with financial institutions like Charles Schwab or Fidelity.</p>
        <p>''The era of the broad-based portal is coming to an end,'' she said. ''Forrester expects that only three will remain by 2004. Niche sites hold the best chance of survival, and this trend applies to ethnic sites, too.''</p>
        <p>Eliot Kang, president and chief executive of Kang &amp; Lee Advertising in New York, a unit of Young &amp; Rubicam that specializes in the Asian-American market, warned that aMedia faces tough challenges.</p>
        <p>''If you do one thing really well in the general market, you can do really well,'' said Mr. Yang, who is also president of the Association of Asian-American Advertising Agencies. ''But in the Asian market, you've got to do everything well. AMedia's got to be eBay and Amazon.com and Priceline.com and CNBC in the aggregate to provide enough income and revenue, and be a stable business. There's not much room to make mistakes.''</p>
