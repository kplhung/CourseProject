        <p>Anthony Mason, the former Knick who now plays for the Charlotte Hornets, was arrested on Monday night in New Orleans and charged with inciting a riot, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred shortly after 9 p.m. Monday when New Orleans police officers responded to an argument between two groups of men in the French Quarter. The police said that when officers tried to separate the men, who were apparently arguing over women, Mason struck one of the officers without provocation.</p>
        <p>The police said the 6-foot-7-inch, 270-pound Mason was sprayed with pepper spray after he resisted officers' attempts to arrest him. They said Mason continued to resist arrest, managed to flee and was then caught a short distance from the scene. After he was handcuffed, the police said, Mason began to incite a crowd that had gathered, yelling to them to help him escape. Some in the crowd began throwing bottles and other debris at the officers, who were forced to retreat to a nearby police station, where they were followed by the crowd. The police said they could not estimate the size of the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mason was subsequently taken to Charity Hospital to have his face washed and treated for pepper spray and then to the central lockup for booking. His whereabouts yesterday were unclear, although The Associated Press reported that Mason had been released from custody.</p>
        <p>It was the latest in a string of run-ins the 33-year-old Mason, a native of Queens, has had with the police, dating to 1989 when the New York City  police charged Mason with gun possession. In that instance, he was sentenced to probation and community service.</p>
        <p>In April 1996, three people filed a $54 million lawsuit, charging Mason with attacking them at the the China Club on the Upper West Side. Two weeks earlier, the police were called to the club after a New Jersey woman claimed that Mason punched her in the eye. No charges were filed in that incident.</p>
        <p>In July 1996, shortly after he was traded to the Hornets, Mason was charged with assault, menacing and resisting arrest after a fight with two New York City police officers over a parking ticket. It took 10 officers to subdue Mason, who pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was given 120 hours of community service.</p>
        <p>In June 1998, Mason pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of endangering the welfare of a child in connection with an incident earlier that year in which he and a cousin were accused of having consensual sex with two girls, aged 14 and 15, at a house in Queens. He was ordered to serve 200 hours of community service working with the homeless at a church in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Last February, Mason was charged with assault after he and a group of friends were involved in a brawl in a Harlem bar that left three people injured. The charges against Mason and his friends were dropped last month after prosecutors said they did not have enough evidence to prove that the men participated in the brawl.</p>
        <p>Mason now stands accused of three misdemeanor charges stemming from the New Orleans incidents, all of which carry fines of no more than $500 and imprisonment of no more than six months. But the most serious charge, battery on a police officer, carries a mandatory prison sentence of not less than 15 days and no more than six months, if convicted, the police said.</p>
