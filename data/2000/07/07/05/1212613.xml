        <p>Can a 3-year-old colt named Albert the Great, who skipped the Triple Crown wars in the first half of the racing season, become a star in the second half and help restore Nicholas the Great to his rank among trainers?</p>
        <p>Nick Zito considered the question at Barn 12 at Belmont Park the other day, and said: ''He made the first start of his career only in January, but he has the potential to be one of the best we ever had. He'll run all day, and as he goes longer, he'll get better.''</p>

        <p>Can a 3-year-old colt named Albert the Great, who skipped the Triple Crown wars in the first half of the racing season, become a star in the second half and help restore Nicholas the Great to his rank among trainers?</p>
        <p>Nick Zito considered the question at Barn 12 at Belmont Park the other day, and said: ''He made the first start of his career only in January, but he has the potential to be one of the best we ever had. He'll run all day, and as he goes longer, he'll get better.''</p>
        <p>Zito is plotting an ambitious summer and fall for his prodigy, who has won his last three races, but who will take a giant step upward next Sunday in the Dwyer Stakes when he tangles with several top graduates of the Triple Crown. They are More Than Ready, who ran fourth in the Kentucky Derby; Red Bullet, who won the Preakness; and Commendable, who won the Belmont Stakes. They will run a mile and a sixteenth for a purse of $150,000 and a notch on the championship of the wide-open 3-year-old class.</p>
        <p>Albert the Great will test these formidable stars with two strikes on him: He did not run anywhere last year as a 2-year-old, and he will be appearing in his first stakes race. He will be a figure of unusual intrigue, the late bloomer, the ace in the hole for one of the most accomplished trainers of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Zito won the 1991 Kentucky Derby with Strike the Gold, the 1994 Derby with Go for Gin and the 1996 Preakness with Louis Quatorze, snapping the winning streak in the classics by D. Wayne Lukas at six.</p>
        <p>Albert the Great was still running in allowance races earlier this year while Zito was approaching the Kentucky Derby with Greenwood Lake, winner of the Champagne and the Remsen last year and one of the early favorites for the Derby this year. But just like that, in the first week in March, the chance was gone. Greenwood Lake came back from a workout limping, and his quest for the Triple Crown was ended with a fractured left foreleg. And for the first time in 10 years, one of the star trainers of the Triple Crown did not even see a Triple Crown race.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it was emotional for me,'' Zito said. ''This is a game of dreams, a game of people and so much romance. The Triple Crown has been part of my life for the last 10 years. It means so much to our stable. It seemed strange for me to miss the Derby, Preakness and Belmont this spring after years of being deeply involved. There were rumors that I might run Albert in the Belmont, but it was too big a step. And Bare Outline just didn't make the cut.</p>
        <p>''But now I have the chance to catch the first-half horses with a second-half winner. People get caught up with the horses that win the classics. But for the rest of the year, the fresh-horse theory can be just as important in deciding championships. Everybody's looking for the good horse these days. I think I've found mine.''</p>
        <p>Albert the Great is a bay gelding who was bought by Tracy Farmer of Lexington at the Keeneland auction sale last year for $85,000. But he did not race at 2 because, Zito said, ''he had the usual series of baby things, like splints and shins.'' But he finally went to the races in January at Gulfstream Park, ran third twice, then second and then seventh at Keeneland.</p>
        <p>But finally, he began to dazzle people. On April 22 at Keeneland, he won by 10 lengths. Then he came to New York and won in May and again in June. He went to the front in all three races and stayed there.</p>
        <p>His next test will be the Dwyer Stakes. ''It's a major test, but the way he trains makes me think he will handle it,'' Zito said. ''Then we'll aim him for the Jim Dandy at Saratoga in August and the Travers later in August. Ambitious, yes. But he strikes me as the horse who can do it.''</p>
        <p>At 52, with or without Triple Crown honors, Zito continues to rank among the leading trainers in his hometown, New York City. He trains full barns at Belmont Park and at Saratoga. He has been forced to cope in the last few years while other trainers, notably Lukas and Bob Baffert, have monopolized the winner's circle at the classics. But he has the feeling now that he has found an alternative path to the top.</p>
        <p>He also disclosed that his private life had been stabilized recently with his marriage on June 4 to Kim Nelson.</p>
        <p>''We had been planning it,'' he said, ''but we made the decision one Sunday when we were in Cooperstown upstate. We got a justice of the peace, and got married. I said to Kim, 'I know you like me, but you're not so crazy about the job.' But she accepts it with good grace.''</p>
        <p>The ''job'' takes a new turn Sunday when Albert the Great springs from the starting gate to pursue his campaign to overtake the veterans of the Triple Crown.</p>
