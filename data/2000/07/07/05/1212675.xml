        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Having lived in Greenwich Village for 34 years, I was totally absorbed by Marian Burros's superb article about members of the Balducci family and their businesses (''Balducci's: A House Divided Stands in Name Only,'' June 28). I've spent more money in Balducci's than I can ever hope to calculate, and I couldn't agree more about the current state of the business. It's a shame that what was once the best food shop in New York has been ruined by commercial interests.</p>

        <p>However, the story makes for superb drama! Doesn't someone have a composer in mind to write an opera celebrating the family saga? All the elements are there.</p>
