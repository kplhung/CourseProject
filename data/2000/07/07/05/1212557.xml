        <p>WHOLE-MEAL salads always feel like a bit of trickery. The best ones are as interesting and varied as a well-conceived meal, and they invariably leave guests impressed that a mere salad could be so satisfying. But the fact that the base is a pile of greens makes me feel as if I'm getting away with something. And I suppose I am. This one, for example, made with grilled scallops and a mesclun mix, takes only 10 minutes longer to make than an ordinary green salad.</p>
        <p>Good whole-meal salads have several things in common. There are a range of textures -- crunchy greens, a toothsome meat or fish, a creamy dressing -- and ingredients cut into a variety of sizes and shapes. The flavors are usually simple, but they build on one another to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

        <p>WHOLE-MEAL salads always feel like a bit of trickery. The best ones are as interesting and varied as a well-conceived meal, and they invariably leave guests impressed that a mere salad could be so satisfying. But the fact that the base is a pile of greens makes me feel as if I'm getting away with something. And I suppose I am. This one, for example, made with grilled scallops and a mesclun mix, takes only 10 minutes longer to make than an ordinary green salad.</p>
        <p>Good whole-meal salads have several things in common. There are a range of textures -- crunchy greens, a toothsome meat or fish, a creamy dressing -- and ingredients cut into a variety of sizes and shapes. The flavors are usually simple, but they build on one another to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
        <p>This salad accomplishes that with just a few ingredients. The greens are basic; you can use any combination, or a single lettuce, but a mesclun mix is the easiest and best choice.</p>
        <p>The dressing is powerful and delicious. You might call it a soy-sesame vinaigrette, but there is more to it than that. Although it will taste exotic to most people, it is prepared with some fairly common ingredients like soy sauce, sesame paste, ginger and garlic.</p>
        <p>I use a blender to assemble the dressing for two reasons: It makes quick work of dispersing the sesame paste throughout the liquid ingredients -- something that can be difficult to do with a fork or a whisk -- and because the blender purees the garlic and the ginger, it eliminates the need to mince them.</p>
        <p>Grilled scallops are almost ludicrously fast and easy, and their texture and flavor complement the greens and the dressing. But you could also use shrimp, steak or boneless chicken -- preferably thighs, which have better flavor than breasts and are less likely to dry out over the grill's heat. Whichever you choose, you could also cook it on top of the stove in a grill pan or a regular skillet.</p>
        <p>The recipe's timing is one of its strengths. Start the grill, or heat a pan on top of the stove, and while it is getting warm, make the dressing and wash the greens.</p>
        <p>Then, when everything is ready, sear the scallops just long enough so that the exterior is brown -- a couple of minutes a side is plenty.</p>
        <p>TRIPLE SESAME SALAD WITH SCALLOPS  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 cup soy sauce</p>
        <p>1/4 cup rice wine or other vinegar  2 tablespoons sesame tahini or smooth peanut butter  1 tablespoon sesame oil</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, cayenne or ground chilies, or to taste  1 tablespoon honey</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon peeled and chopped garlic  1 teaspoon peeled and chopped ginger  1 1/2 to 2 pounds sea scallops  Salt  6 to 8 cups mesclun or other salad greens, washed and dried</p>
        <p>1/4 cup torn Thai or other basil, washed  and dried, optional  2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</p>
        <p>1. Prepare a gas or charcoal grill. Place soy, vinegar, tahini, sesame oil, red pepper, honey, garlic and ginger in a blender, and blend until smooth. When grill is hot, sprinkle  scallops with salt and grill about 2 minutes a side; they should remain tender and undercooked in the middle.</p>
        <p>2. Combine greens and basil, and divide among 4 plates. When scallops are done, place them on top of the greens. Drizzle with dressing, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
