        <p>The conventional wisdom has been that European companies, newly emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at home, would use Wall Street style tactics in crossborder deals unifying the Continent. But not following the script, European companies have increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the United States first.</p>
        <p>From Vivendi's recent deal to acquire Seagram to Unilever's agreement to buy Bestfoods to Terra Network's buyout of Lycos, Europe is looking across the ocean before it looks across the street.</p>
        <p>And with Deutsche Telekom of Germany strongly considering making a bid for Sprint, trans-Atlantic deal-making seems to be unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''European companies are in a pretty mad scramble to be global,'' said Donald Meltzer, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ''You go where you can do the deals to achieve a critical mass. And acquiring control is still easier in the U.S.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, European companies have completed a handful of crossborder deals, including the largest takeover in corporate history, Vodafone AirTouch's $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann. That was supposed to pave the way for even more such takeovers, but now investment bankers are less sure about the potential for big crossborder European deals than they used to be.</p>
        <p>In fact, in the last year it became apparent that many of the political and cultural roadblocks that were supposed to have disappeared were still up. Spain's largest telephone company, Telefonica, tried to buy the Dutch telephone operator Royal KPN in May, but was foiled by the Spanish government, which owns a controlling share in Telefonica and blocked the deal over political concerns. A privately proposed merger between Telefonica and British Telecommunications was also thwarted.</p>
        <p>''In certain sectors -- telecommunications, banking, media -- there is still going to be nationalistic tendencies,'' said Daniel M. Dickinson, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch in London.</p>
        <p>Even intra-country deals have been stymied, exemplified in Germany by Dresdner Bank's recently failed merger with Deutsche Bank, and in Norway by the foiled marriage of two phone companies, Telenor and Telia.</p>
        <p>Still, some investment bankers are not too concerned about the problems that have hung up European deals. ''I think Anglo-Saxon tactics can be applied in Europe,'' said Simon Robey, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. Nonetheless, he added, ''It's pretty natural to expect we'll see trans-Atlantic activity in all the big sectors.''</p>
        <p>Others have pointed out that the market for trans-Atlantic deals has expanded because investors in the United States are now more receptive to foreign acquirers. The stocks of many European acquirers are relatively high, enabling them to pay big premiums for American takeover targets. And European companies that want to increase their size quickly are inclined to go after American companies, which are usually much bigger, before looking at their neighbors. ''The game at the moment is to do something strategically transforming,'' Mr. Robey said.</p>
        <p>While trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions have increased recently, overall deal-making has actually slowed the last three months, according to statistics released today by Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks mergers and acquisitions. The global market for deals in the April-June quarter fell by 32 percent to $760 billion after a record-breaking first quarter of $1.121 trillion. Most of the decline can be attributed to activity from deals in the United States, which fell to $324 billion from $568 billion. European activity remained relatively flat at $298 billion, compared with $303 billion in the earlier quarter. Nonetheless, global activity for the first half of the year surpassed previous results with a total of $1.882 trillion in deals.</p>
        <p>As Wall Street banks jockey to rake in the most deals, the race is tight, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs in a virtual tie at the top. Based on completed deals so far this year, Goldman is the leader, followed by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, J. P. Morgan and UBS Warburg. But based on deals announced so far this year, Morgan Stanley leads, followed by Goldman, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, Merrill and Credit Suisse.</p>
