        <p>DDB, the agency for Mobil since 1949, competed against the Houston office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, the agency for Exxon and predecessors like Standard Oil of New Jersey since 1912. McCann-Erickson -- part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- will continue to work on a portion of the global lubricants marketing assignment.</p>
