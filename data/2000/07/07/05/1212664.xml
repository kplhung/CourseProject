        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like Marcus Jacoby, I went to high school in Baton Rouge, La. (''The Minority Quarterback,'' ''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, July 2). As a person of South Asian descent, I prided myself in my ability to interact comfortably with both blacks and whites alike. At first, I assumed that it was my ''neutral'' race that enabled me to be accepted by both groups, but it was not until I spent a semester in Spain in my college years that I realized my real advantage was not in my brown color but in my ability to mix comfortably with people of different cultures.</p>

        <p>Although there is no doubt that racism made it difficult for Marcus Jacoby to adjust to life at Southern University, it is the everyday problem of being in a place where you are culturally different that makes life the most strenuous.</p>
