        <p>If the widespread expectation is that the summer's political conventions will stir up about as much excitement as a city council debate over landfill fees, there is an upstart element in the news business that sees endless hours of fun and drama where others envision ennui: the press corps of the Web.</p>
        <p>From boutique start-up ventures like Speakout.com to virtual empires like America Online, Web sites and Webzines are looking to the political gatherings in Philadelphia and Los Angeles as potential defining moments in the evolution of news on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Democratic and Republican officials say online enterprises are requesting space in numbers no one anticipated. Organizers of the Democratic convention, which begins in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, say, for instance, that more than 100 Web sites have applied, and the list is growing daily. So many wanted work stations along the newly christened ''Internet Avenue'' in the hall that the party had to expand the area into the east and west wings, said Lindsey Berman, who has a job title new to political conventioneering: Internet news media manager.</p>
        <p>The Web is even infiltrating that august symbol of convention coverage, the skybooth. This year, the old-line networks and all-news cable channels have new dot-com neighbors in the booths high above the convention floors. Pseudo.com, America Online and USAToday.com have all been allotted booths, whose costs at the Republican convention start at $20,000 but with modifications can go much higher.</p>
        <p>With the broadcast networks scaling back their prime-time coverage of the conventions -- ABC is not even pre-empting Monday Night Football preseason games -- the Web, even more voluminously than the 24-hour cable stations, is rushing to fill the void. In fact, the ways the Internet brings users closer to the process could become one of the proceedings' more compelling stories.</p>
        <p>''In a lot of ways, it's the perfect Web story,'' said Kerry Lauerman, the Washington bureau chief of Salon, an online magazine that will have six editors and reporters covering the proceedings from work stations in the arenas. ''It's a story that's live, with its own peaks and depths.''</p>
        <p>On the convention floor, reporters for Voter.com and Evote will mingle with the delegates. Around the hall, pool cameras operated by C-Span will send convention images via streaming video to computer users around the country who will be able to watch from the angle of their choice. MSNBC.com, in association with Hotline, the online political digest, will produce a live hourly Webcast from the convention throughout the day.</p>
        <p>And America Online will have an open ''skybox cam'' trained on the halls 24 hours a day, to provide real-time transmissions from the crack of the chairman's gavel to the slosh of the janitor's mop.</p>
        <p>The gizmos to be used may make it seem at times that the First Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los Angeles are staging hardware conventions. Pseudo.com, for instance, will have a 360-degree camera taking in events all around the arena. Voter.com plans to issue ''smart cards'' to delegates that can be used to gain access to consoles that will tell them where the late night parties are. Reporters for operations large and small will circulate with all sorts of minicameras.</p>
        <p>''Because it's the Web, there will be a million different kinds of coverage,'' said Jacob Weisberg, political writer for the Webzine Slate. ''It is going to be an interesting experiment, and it can only make the conventions more interesting: the removal of a single, heavy-duty spotlight and in its place hundreds of tiny little spotlights.''</p>
        <p>A parched landscape for news does not faze the dot-coms, which liken the arrival of e-journalism to another innovation in political news, the television camera, introduced 52 years ago at a political convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>''What the 2000 campaign is doing to the term 'new media' is taking the 'new' out,'' said Carin Dessauer, election director for CNN Interactive. ''We've arrived.''</p>
        <p>And arriving in all sizes. Internet operations with vast resources, like CNN's allpolitics.com, and even start-ups like Voter.com, a bipartisan site that went online last November, will have larger contingents at the conventions than most newspapers. Voter.com, under the editorship of Carl Bernstein, will have 40 people at each of the gatherings.</p>
        <p>The Internet has come a very long way since the 1996 conventions, when only a handful of Web operations were present. ''I was sitting in the nosebleed seats typing on my laptop with the college newspaper press,'' recalled Kathleen deLaski, the director of political and government programming for America Online. This year hundreds or more Internet reporters will be among the 15,000 reporters, technicians and support staff accredited for each convention.</p>
        <p>While reporters for some news organizations work in more than one medium, many others will be reporting exclusively to cyberspace, in a rainbow of styles, from serious to satirical, from text-driven to telegenic. ''We're going to keep it very junkie-specific,'' said Chuck Todd, editor of Hotline, on the National Journal Web site. ''We're not trying to make it interesting for Mr. and Mrs. Public; we're trying to make it interesting for Republican operatives.''</p>
        <p>Pseudo.com, a ''video experience on the computer,'' on the other hand, will try a broader tack, carrying Webcasts, chats and a variety of video and audio on its Pseudopolitics page, which began on Jan. 24.</p>
        <p>''We're going to try to offer viewers a sort of immersive experience, in that they ought to feel like they're at the convention themselves,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of Pseudopolitics.</p>
        <p>It is as if ''The Truman Show'' has made its way to the political show.</p>
        <p>''The big difference between now and four years ago is video,'' said Chris Long, director of new media for C-Span, which not only is providing the pool television coverage of the convention for the networks, but also will have a camera in its own booth, over the director's shoulder. Viewers, in effect, will be able to design their own coverage.</p>
        <p>The populist implications of a digital invasion are for a virtual catalog of new ways to experience politics. But will the appeal reach beyond the most politically obsessed?</p>
        <p>Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, answered with his own question: ''Did the advent of C-Span lead to that much greater knowledge and greater connectedness to Capitol Hill? It's going to be a matter of great enrichment to people who are really interested in this stuff. And yet they may be painfully small in numbers.''</p>
        <p>Web site and Webzine operators say a limited audience is not a concern. One appeal of the conventions on the Internet, they say, is that a site can fulfill its mission by offering a perspective as broad or as narrow as its audience wants.</p>
        <p>''It's still a communal experience but of significance to a shrinking number of people,'' said Michael Silberman, executive editor of MSNBC.com. ''What the Web brings is the ability to reach out and get information about your specific states that you care about, to interact directly with a delegate, to ask a question directly of a floor correspondent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernstein, who is both executive editor of Voter.com and a partner in the venture, says the vastness of the Internet gives it a leg up with the people who care most deeply about the conventions. ''We can put up a whole book if need be, put up Charlton Heston on video going on for an hour and a half about guns,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, the dot-coms acknowledge, not every site will survive the competition in the political arena, and the casualties may be apparent at the conclusion of the party gatherings.</p>
        <p>''If we do what TV does, we fail,'' said David Bohrman, the chief executive of Pseudo.com. ''We have to do something completely different. We have to almost deconstruct the process, give the users the feel of the convention, to touch what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Web reporters face some of the same problems as their print and television counterparts. There may be infinite room in cyberspace but not in greater Philadelphia, as the convention reporters for Evote discovered.</p>
        <p>''Actually, both of them did find hotel space, but it's like a two-hour drive out there,'' said Peter Markel, Evote's director of strategic planning. ''That was one of the last things in our planning.''</p>
