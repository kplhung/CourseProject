        <p>Sipping a glass of pinot meunier in a local winery, Christopher Newton reminisced about his first few seasons as artistic director of the Shaw Festival. Audiences walked out of his 1980 production of ''The Philanderer,'' and his 1981 plan to stage ''St. Joan'' without its epilogue failed when the Society of Authors threatened to withhold the rights to the play. One critic suggested that Mr. Newton be fired or that the Shaw Festival change its name.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one years after he was hired, Mr. Newton, 64, still holds the job, and the Shaw Festival is one of the largest theater events in North America, attracting nearly 350,000 people a year to this old-fashioned village 8 miles downstream from Niagara Falls and 35 miles north of Buffalo. The 11-play festival opened in April and ends on Dec. 10. More than a third of the audience comes from the United States. Festival memberships, which include advance purchase privileges, have nearly doubled to 9,000 in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newton, a native of Kent, England, who has been awarded the Order of Canada, the country's highest honor, is credited with ''keeping together a strong ensemble of actors and fostering a very striking, very intelligent visual and aural style of production,'' in the words of Robert Cushman, theater critic for The National Post.</p>
        <p>With just three seasons left until his retirement in 2002, Mr. Newton is leading the festival through a major expansion of its mandate. Since its inception in 1962, the festival has focused on plays written during Shaw's lifetime, 1856 to 1950, which meant Wilde, Coward, Ibsen and Chekhov and musical greats like the Gershwin brothers and Cole Porter.</p>
        <p>This season, however, he opened the festival to more modern plays. Nigel Williams's adaption of William Goldings 1955 novel ''Lord of the Flies'' opens July 5, and Joe Masteroff's musical ''She Loves Me'' is running through the festival's last day.</p>
        <p>''You have to rethink yourself and reinvent yourself all the time,'' Mr. Newton said, adding, ''This seemed a good opportunity with Shaw coming out of copyright.'' The festival has paid $168,000 to $335,000 a year in copyright fees to Shaw's estate. Since the copyright expires 50 years after Shaw's death, the festival can use that money to commission new works and to buy rights to more recent plays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newton directed three plays this season, though only one is a product of the new mandate. Shaw's exploration of medical ethics, ''The Doctors Dilemma,'' has had three previous stagings at the festival, and Noel Coward's ''Easy Virtue'' was repeated from last year. ''The Matchmaker'' by Thornton Wilder, set in 1880's Yonkers, was written in 1954, four years after Shaw's death.</p>
        <p>The remainder of the playbill is vintage festival material: Shaw's political satire ''The Apple Cart,'' Wilde's melodrama ''A Woman of No Importance,'' Coward's ''Still Life,'' J. B. Priestley's family drama ''Time and the Conways'' and Luigi Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author.''</p>
        <p>''We are not terribly experimental,'' Mr. Newton said. ''We never will be, because our audience isn't. Most of the plays they've never heard of, they've never seen. They've got to trust that there will be good acting and that it will be done sensibly.''</p>
        <p>Like a sommelier bringing obscure vintages from the cellar, however, Mr. Newton ventures beyond classics and crowd-pleasers. ''Where are you going to see 'Ivona, Princess of Burgundia' except here, and where are you going to see any plays by Henry Arthur Jones?'' he asked. ''You're blowing the dust off things, and in any major cultural center, that's what you spend a lot of time doing.</p>
        <p>''Years ago, I must admit, I couldn't quite see what the relevance was of the Shaw Festival. Then when I got here, the point suddenly became a lot clearer to me. Shaw's lifetime has given us all insights and clues into how we live today.''</p>
