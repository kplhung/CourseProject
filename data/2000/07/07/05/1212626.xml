        <p>New data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms confirms that people living in states with strict gun laws are not insulated from guns imported from other states. This is largely traceable to Congress's failure to enact nationwide standards on interstate gun trafficking. The data, which appears in a new study by Senator Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, shows that four states with weak gun control laws -- Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas -- were the source of nearly a quarter of the 30,454 guns used in crimes committed elsewhere last year that could be traced back to dealers.</p>
        <p>Only 769 guns used in out-of-state crimes originated in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut or Massachusetts. These states have relatively strong gun laws that discourage straw purchasers and otherwise deter criminals from obtaining weapons. But fully two-thirds of guns used in crimes in New York, and about 70 percent of those used in New Jersey, came from other states.</p>

        <p>New data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms confirms that people living in states with strict gun laws are not insulated from guns imported from other states. This is largely traceable to Congress's failure to enact nationwide standards on interstate gun trafficking. The data, which appears in a new study by Senator Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, shows that four states with weak gun control laws -- Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas -- were the source of nearly a quarter of the 30,454 guns used in crimes committed elsewhere last year that could be traced back to dealers.</p>
        <p>Only 769 guns used in out-of-state crimes originated in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut or Massachusetts. These states have relatively strong gun laws that discourage straw purchasers and otherwise deter criminals from obtaining weapons. But fully two-thirds of guns used in crimes in New York, and about 70 percent of those used in New Jersey, came from other states.</p>
        <p>Tellingly, Virginia and South Carolina, which enacted strict gun laws several years ago, saw their ranking as out-of-state gun suppliers begin to drop as a result. Virginia, for example, the third-largest supplier of out-of-state crime guns in 1997, now ranks seventh. South Carolina, which ranked third in 1996, has fallen to 13th on the list.</p>
        <p>It is probably not a coincidence that states with the worst records also tend to be popular locales for gun shows where, thanks to a loophole in the Brady law, criminals and other people disqualified by law from buying guns can easily purchase them without undergoing any background check. This is not a minor problem. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has found that nearly a third of the illegal guns recovered in gun trafficking investigations between July 1996 and December 1998 were originally purchased at a gun show.</p>
        <p>There are any number of sensible steps Congress could take to crack down on this one-way gun-trafficking trade, including requiring licensing and registration of handguns and limiting handgun purchases nationwide to one per month, as a number of states have done. Though these ideas have gone nowhere in this Congress, modest progress is still possible if the Republican leadership stops dithering over a measure that would require background checks on prospective purchasers before all gun show sales.</p>
