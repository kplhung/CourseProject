        <p>They are police officers by trade, but their appearance, as a group, does not exactly shout law enforcement.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is the tattoos and beards. Or the bandannas and bare, barrel chests. Or the black leather vests crowned with the likeness of a tusked boar in mid-snarl. Or the V-Twin Harley-Davidson cruisers equipped with shotgun dual exhausts and tuned to scorch the road.</p>
        <p>Or maybe it is their name: The Wild Pigs.</p>
        <p>''We have been stopped by police officers out of state,'' said one Wild Pig who asked to remain anonymous. ''We tell them, 'Hey, we're cops,' and they say, 'Really? You guys are cops?' And two hours later they are at our barbecue.''</p>
        <p>With 1,400 members in 80 chapters, the Wild Pigs are one of two increasingly popular, national motorcycle clubs that draw their members from the law enforcement ranks. The second club, known as the Blue Knights, is even larger, with 11,630 members in 373 chapters, including dozens of chapters in New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In a world infatuated with stereotypes, police biker clubs illustrate that the universe of officers includes more than a few free spirits for whom rebellion has become a weekend pastime. During riding season, from April to October, Wild Pigs and Blue Knights, and smaller clubs like the Lawmen and Celtic Law, organize trips as ambitious as a weeklong pilgrimage to Daytona Beach and as modest as an evening spin to Little Italy.</p>
        <p>Two thousand bikers, primarily police officers, poured into that New York neighborhood last Wednesday night, roaring through the Holland Tunnel from New Jersey, as part of Gooch's Garlic Run, a ride sponsored by the Blue Knights to benefit sick children. The bike procession stretched 14 miles along Route 80, organizers said. Then the leather-clad riders filled Mulberry Street trattorias to overflowing.</p>
        <p>''I had a family on the corner who wanted to know what was going on,'' said Anthony Fontana, manager of Caffe Napoli. ''I told them, these are cops and they come here once a year. They smiled. If this had been some other group they would have turned around and left.''</p>
        <p>As motorcyclists, the Wild Pigs and the Blue Knights share a taste for a face full of wind, the freedom of the open road, the embrace of the wide, blue sky and the brotherhood of bikes and babes in black leather. As public safety officers, both active and retired, they share an interest in supporting the families of fallen colleagues and raising money for charity. The Blue Knights, for example, say they have raised nearly $3 million in cash for charity since 1991.</p>
        <p>But there are distinctions between the clubs as well. The Blue Knights, who were founded 26 years ago in Bangor, Me., are a G-rated bunch, as motorcycle clubs go. Club members, a range of law enforcement professionals, including correction officers, wear leather vests, or ''colors,'' that are an unthreatening shade of powder blue. Their logo is a knight atop a rearing white horse. One of their slogans is: ''There are no strangers, only friends you haven't met.''</p>
        <p>''You ride safe and you are courteous,'' said Joseph Edelmann, a Blue Knight who retired from the New York Police Department 13 years ago and rides with Chapter 7, which covers Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn. About half the 70 members are New York Police Department officers, both active and retired. ''We are trying to change the whole outlook on bikers,'' Mr. Edelmann said.</p>
        <p>The Wild Pigs have adopted a more intimidating look, a la the Oakland Raiders, and their manner is more full-throttle.</p>
        <p>The club was born in San Jose, Calif., 13 years after the Blue Knights, and it accepts a variety of public safety personnel as members, including firefighters, as long as they ride American-made bikes, usually Harleys.</p>
        <p>''People like to portray us as a bunch of knuckle draggers wearing leather jackets,'' said one Wild Pig. ''The reality is that it's a fraternal organization of people who share a common interest.''</p>
        <p>Susan Buck, 37, editor of Thunder Press East, a monthly motorcycle newspaper, said the Wild Pigs drew members from those who thought the Blue Knights were too strait-laced. ''They wanted black vests instead of blue,'' she said. ''They wanted a little bit of the bad boy image.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Buck recalled riding to the annual nationwide motorcycle rally in Sturgis, S.D., in 1996 when a traffic jam in western Pennsylvania forced her and some Wild Pigs to take a break along the road, not far from a state trooper. ''I reach in and pull out a bottle of water,'' she said. ''They are popping beers on the road.''</p>
        <p>Mike Blazer, a Wild Pig from Chicago who is the club's spokesman and lawyer, said the incident, if true, was an aberration. ''Our members are sensitive that they live under a microscope,'' he said, ''so they are incredibly careful and scrupulous about the creation of any false impression.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, like the Blue Knights, the Wild Pigs organize benefits for charity each year. The Westchester chapter, one of eight in New York State, will be holding a pig roast in August for Nick Springer, a 15-year-old boy from Croton-on-Hudson who lost his hands and the lower part of his legs last year to a bacterial disease. The boy's father, Gary Springer, said the club just sent him a letter one day, out of the blue, offering its help.</p>
        <p>''This is a great group of guys,'' he said, ''and it's obvious that they care.''</p>
        <p>Membership in either club is not an issue with the New York Police Department. ''Officers are allowed to join fraternal clubs or organizations at their own discretion as long as they do not engage in any criminality,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas Fahey.</p>
        <p>Only a handful of Wild Pigs were willing to be interviewed for this article. Only one, Mr. Blazer, would agree to be quoted by name. He said the club had been victimized in the past by bad press and overzealousness by a small circle of motorcycle gang investigators who had chased some unfounded rumors about unsavory activities.</p>
        <p>Some of the suspicion, he said, stemmed from a member's brief lapse in judgment seven years ago when he posed for a picture with a Hell's Angel, who was his cousin. The Wild Pig was later kicked out of the club because contact with outlaw bikers is banned, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have a zero tolerance policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But even if Wild Pigs do not chase trouble, it has found them on occasion.</p>
        <p>In May, two Wild Pigs from Washington, D.C., who were in New York for a charity event were wounded in a drive-by shooting outside a biker bar in Chelsea. Investigators said it remained unclear what led the gunman, in a sports utility vehicle, to open fire.</p>
        <p>But the investigators are looking into a report that it might have stemmed from an altercation several weeks earlier on Long Island between several Wild Pigs and Hell's Angels after a bike blessing, an event in which clergy members bless motorcycles to keep their riders safe.</p>
        <p>Hours after the blessing, outside a nearby bar, an argument erupted over whether a Wild Pig had slapped a club sticker on an Angel's bike, investigators said. There were words, and by some accounts, punches thrown, but no one ever pressed any charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blazer said the Wild Pigs who were there that day did not touch anyone else's bike, which is a mortal sin in the motorcycle world. A lawyer for the Hell's Angel's, Ronald L. Kuby, said his clients had no role in the Manhattan shootings.</p>
        <p>Wild Pigs and Blue Knights said that in general, they keep their distance from outlaw bikers and the parties they sponsor, although they do attend large motorcycle rallies that often draw outlaws.</p>
        <p>''They do their thing,'' said one former Wild Pig. ''We do ours. We don't talk to them or shake hands.''</p>
        <p>This policy has had breakdowns, however. Three years ago, in Laconia, N.H., at the town's annual motorcycle rally, a group of Hell's Angels confronted two Wild Pigs to object that a Wild Pig had called them ''drug dealers and punks'' in a newspaper article. The discussion ended peacefully, but police officials have said it helped set a tone that led to a later brawl in which several Hell's Angels assaulted uniformed officers patrolling the event.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago at the Laconia rally, there were rumors of brewing trouble between the Wild Pigs and the Angels, stemming from the recent incidents in New York, said the town's police chief, William Baker. A number of Wild Pigs even offered to doff their colors to avoid an incident, but Chief Baker said he did not think it was necessary and there were no problems.</p>
        <p>''We have our detractors,'' one Wild Pig acknowledged, ''those that have decided that anyone on a Harley must be some kind of lowlife.'' In reality, he said, ''we're just a bunch of cops who like to ride motorcycles.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 6, 2000, Thursday  A headline and caption yesterday with an article about groups of police officers who ride motorcyles off duty described the groups incorrectly in some editions. The groups, which include the Wild Pigs and Blue Knights, are motorcycle clubs for law enforcement officers, not ''gangs.''</p>
