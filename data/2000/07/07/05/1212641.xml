        <p>The Yankees keep waiting for the streak, the burst of victories that will remind them how good they were and might be again. Orlando Hernandez won Saturday, Roger Clemens won Sunday and many of the Yankees probably started thinking about riding a string of victories into next week's All-Star break.</p>
        <p>The streak was relayed to David Cone yesterday and he dropped it, right in the middle of Yankee Stadium, surrendering four homers in 5 2/3 innings to the aging Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>The Yankees rallied in the ninth, but never overcame Cone's deficit, losing 7-6. And now the Yankees are stationary again, bogged down in mediocrity, their record 40-37, their position a game and a half out of first place.</p>
        <p>Losing a game to the Mets last month was annoying to the Yankees. Dropping a couple to Cleveland might be frustrating. Yesterday's loss was devastating, ''a killer,'' Cone called it, and he was right.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had won back-to-back games to finish a long 6-7 road trip; they were home to play a second-division team - a club the Yankees need to dominate --- and Cone never gave them a chance. He is 1-7,  more than two months removed from his last victory.</p>
        <p>''I'm not doing anything to help the team,'' said Cone.</p>
        <p>The Yankees keep waiting for that winning streak, and the starting pitching keeps undermining them. Sometimes the saboteur has been Cone, sometimes Clemens or Andy Pettitte, sometimes it has been injuries. But it's always the starting pitching: The Yankees have not had three consecutive quality starts (six or more innings, three runs or less) since the middle of May.</p>
        <p>The Yankee starters have reached the seventh inning in only 15 of the team's last 40 games, which goes a long way toward explaining why they have not won more than two consecutive games since the last time Baltimore was in town; on May 6, they collected the fourth and final victory in a winning streak.</p>
        <p>They needed this game, and they had an early lead, scoring twice in the bottom of the first after the Orioles had plated a run in the top of the first. But Cone was essentially without ammunition. He has had days this season when he wielded a decent fastball or an effective slider, but Cone had neither yesterday; his fastball was benign and his slider was flat, lifeless. He was relying on guile and guts.</p>
        <p>If this had been a bad Western, he would have thrown his pistol at the Orioles.''His stuff has been consistent,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ''He just has trouble with his total command.''</p>
        <p>Cone's approach in pitching to the second batter of the game, Mike Bordick, revealed much about his stuff.  He threw fastballs to get ahead in the count no balls and two strikes, Bordick fouling off two pitches. Cone has dominated Bordick over the years, holding him to nine hits in 42 at-bats, with nine strikeouts. When he got ahead in the count in past seasons, he would sweep sliders near the outside corner, or lower his arm angle and tease Bordick into chasing a high fastball.</p>
        <p>But Cone did not choose to throw sliders to Bordick in the first inning yesterday, perhaps because his slider hasn't been that good. He rarely lowers his arm angle this season. Cone tried finishing off Bordick with fastballs, instead, thrown over the top. He tried jamming Bordick, and Bordick pulled a home run down the left field line.</p>
        <p>Chris Turner, Cone's catcher, said later that he thought Cone had pitched better than the results indicated, that it is only a matter of time before Cone rebounds. The slider, he acknowledged, ''was just kind of rolling; it didn't have that much bite.</p>
        <p>''He's going to have to spot his fastball because it doesn't have the velocity it used to have. If he doesn't'' spot his fastball, Turner added, ''he's going to get hit.''</p>
        <p>Harold Baines opened the second inning by slamming a low split-fingered fastball into the seats. Charles Johnson, the next batter, almost never draws walks, but Cone walked him on four pitches. Two batters later, Cone tried to get ahead on the count with Brady Anderson, tried sneaking a first-pitch fastball past him, and Anderson bashed the pitch into the seats. The Orioles had three more runs and led, 4-2. An absolute killer.</p>
        <p>Cone changed speeds better in the third, fourth and fifth, pitching mostly outside, some sliders a little sharper. But there was always the sense that he was just hanging on, one mistake away from a major crisis.</p>
        <p>B.J. Surhoff smashed a one-hopper to the mound leading off the sixth and Cone reacted well, gloving the ball, before stepping toward first base and throwing -- high. Jorge Posada, normally the Yankees' catcher, was playing first, and he had to leave the bag and leap. By the time he stretched a foot to touch first, Surhoff was across the bag. Cone dropped his chin, disgusted.</p>
        <p>Surhoff took second on a grounder, and the Yankees intentionally walked Baines, who has always hit well against Cone. Bernie Williams made a diving catch on a looper to center by Johnson, and it looked as if Cone would get through the inning.</p>
        <p>Mark Lewis, a part-time player who had not hit a home run this season, strolled to the plate. Lewis decided that if Cone threw a slider, he was going to swing at it. Cone did throw a slider, a lifeless slider. Lewis hammered it to right-center field, over the wall. The home run muted the crowd of 44,447 for a few seconds.  But the fans were revived by Cone's departure, booing him purposefully.</p>
        <p>Down by 7-2, the Yankees scored one run in the eighth, three in the ninth. But with Derek Jeter at second base and two out, Paul O'Neill grounded out and the Yankees fell short by one run, a discouraging defeat, a killer loss.</p>
