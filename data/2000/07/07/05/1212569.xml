        <p>BRESAOLA isn't exactly a household word in America. So when the real thing began being imported three weeks ago, there wasn't much fuss about it. But bresaola, air-dried beef from Valtellina, in northern Italy, is moist and delicate, and completely unlike the salty and slightly leathery domestic versions, or the dryish Swiss bundnerfleisch that Americans have had to make do with for so long.</p>
        <p>True bresaola, pronounced brezh-OH-la, lies gently on the tongue, almost like carpaccio, and then melts away. It has an intriguing, musty bouquet. And unlike prosciutto, bresaola is utterly lean, with no discernible striations of fat. When sliced paper-thin, it is almost translucent.</p>
        <p>What makes it extraordinary, Lou DiPalo of DiPalo's Fine Foods in Little Italy says, is the microclimate of the Valtellina area in northern Lombardy, where it has been made for more than 600 years. Lean cuts of beef from the hindquarter are cured in salt and flavorings -- which ones are a carefully guarded secret that its producers refused to reveal -- and hung out to dry, in big houses, in Valtellina's Alpine breezes. It is then aged three to four months, taking on a deep garnet color and a texture similar to a good prosciutto. It is this brief aging process that provides the allure.</p>
        <p>The domestic and Swiss air-dried beef are aged considerably longer, making them drier.</p>
        <p>Italian bresaola hasn't been available in the United States since 1930, when a provision of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act stipulated that only cooked beef from Italy was to be allowed into the United States. The restriction expired in October 1996. At that time, another embargo against Italian beef, because of foot-and-mouth disease, was also lifted.</p>
        <p>But the doors slammed shut again in December 1997, when all beef products from Italy were banned (and they still are), because of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as mad cow disease. Although there has never been a case of mad cow disease reported in Italy, the Agriculture Department instituted the ban after identifying substantial risk factors.</p>
        <p>Since then, two Italian bresaola makers have come up with a way to satisfy all those concerns: they use beef imported from South America. The Agriculture Department approved their products for import on April 25.</p>
        <p>Italian bresaola made by Rigamonti and Negroni are both identified as Bresaola della Valtellina, and each one bears a blue-and-yellow government seal of authenticity. In New York, their product is available at DiPalo's Fine Foods, Todaro Brothers, Agata &amp; Valentina, Fairway and Balducci's markets. Prices range from about $16 to $19 a pound.</p>
        <p>A little goes a long way. One ounce of thinly sliced bresaola will cover a 10-inch plate nicely -- which is the way bresaola purists like it best, al naturale, eaten with the fingers, just as it is.</p>
        <p>But it is also delicious draped over soft-scrambled eggs, or dressed with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice, sliced in a julienne atop an arugula salad, showered with shards of grana Padano cheese or, in autumn, gilded with shaved white truffles.</p>
