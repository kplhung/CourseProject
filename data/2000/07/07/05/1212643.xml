        <p>A battle has broken out within Mexico's governing party after its election defeat, with several rival leaders maneuvering for control during a painful transition that will test its powers of survival, party leaders say.</p>
        <p>Near chaos gripped the party after its leader, installed during the presidential campaign by the party's candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, presented her resignation, with the expectation that her entire cabinet would leave with her. The party called a meeting of its leaders for tonight to choose replacements, but the elder statesmen were so divided over whom to pick and how to pick them that the meeting was canceled.</p>
        <p>Monday's resignation by Dulce Maria Sauri, the party president, was not formally accepted, said Marcos Bucio, a congressman who was the party's spokesman during the Labastida campaign. But Ms. Sauri appeared to have lost her authority.</p>
        <p>Who was in charge of the party, if anyone, was not clear.</p>
        <p>''This is a time of catharsis,'' Mr. Bucio said.</p>
        <p>The power of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has always been based on the influence and resources of the Mexican presidency, and by tradition the president or president-elect has hired and fired the party's top leaders, virtually at whim.</p>
        <p>But after the party's first defeat in a presidential race since its founding seven decades ago, several of its elder statesmen on Monday refused to back a former governor, Jesus Murillo Karam, to replace Ms. Sauri because he was seen as President Ernesto Zedillo's choice.</p>
        <p>''There are many very different positions now,'' said Javier Trevino, who resigned as deputy treasury secretary to work on Mr. Labastida's campaign. ''Some groups think they don't want a leader who seems to reflect the president. They don't want the president involved. They want this to be more of a PRI decision.''</p>
        <p>A few party leaders said they hoped Mr. Labastida might take the party reins, but it was not clear if he would accept the leadership. On Monday, the defeated presidential candidate went to the party's headquarters in downtown Mexico City to collect his personal belongings.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, Roberto Campa, who sought the nomination last fall as the party's Mexico City mayoral candidate and later worked for Mr. Labastida's campaign, also packed up his personal files and stalked out of party headquarters. He vowed to abandon politics.</p>
        <p>''The voters' message was very clear,'' Mr. Campa said. ''But it doesn't look to me like people around here understood that.''</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Labastida's defeat, the party should also be disturbed by the fact that most of the party's votes in Sunday's election came from sectors of the Mexican population that are disappearing, said Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, a political scientist at the Center for Teaching and Learning in Mexico City.</p>
        <p>''Look at the demographics,'' Mr. Elizondo said. ''They received votes from rural people, who are moving to the cities. They received votes from old people, who are dying. And they received votes from illiterate people, who are becoming more educated. This is a terrible problem.''</p>
        <p>Still, some leaders were looking on the bright side.</p>
        <p>''This is a trial by fire for us,'' said Cristina Alcayaga, a former party human rights official who worked for Mr. Labastida. ''But don't forget, our party received 12 million votes. We have to build bridges to new constituencies and that's not easy. But we're not dead yet.''</p>
        <p>Starting in December, though, when President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada takes office, the party's base of governmental support will shrink to its 20 state governors and the party's much-reduced congressional delegation. How firmly the party's several large unions and peasant organizations will remain tied to it remains unclear.</p>
        <p>The elections have not only devastated the governing party. The largest leftist group, the Party of the Democratic Revolution, is also in turmoil after its presidential candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, came in a distant last among the major candidates. The party's congressional delegation also has been reduced, although it retained control of Mexico City's municipal government.</p>
        <p>During the campaign, Mr. Fox repeatedly invited Mr. Cardenas to join with him to defeat the governing party, but his flirtations went unrequited. Today Mr. Fox again invited the left to join with him in forming the new ''government of unity.'' But Mr. Cardenas spurned that offer too.</p>
