        <p>The McDonald's Corporation in Oak Brook, Ill., is switching ad slogans for the first time in three years. The new slogan, ''We love to see you smile,'' is being introduced in a campaign centered on the changes the company is making to its food and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The campaign was created by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, which regained its status as lead agency on the McDonald's account with a presentation based on the theme ''Did somebody say McDonald's?'' That theme ran from 1997 until last week. The ''smile'' theme -- with the company's Golden Arches trademark forming the ''m'' -- will also appear in ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers, created by del Rivero Messianu Advertising in Coral Gables, Fla., and at black consumers, created by the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by Publicis S.A.</p>

        <p>Some of the changes that McDonald's hopes will make its customers smile include a new food preparation system that cooks meals as they are ordered, new products like the McFlurry dessert and freshening up the restaurants with steps like landscaping and painting.</p>
