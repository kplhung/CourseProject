        <p>Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5, an exploration of spiritual traditions through the ages, will open the Brooklyn Academy of Music's 2000 Next Wave Festival on Oct. 4.</p>
        <p>The symphony, a 12-movement work scored for five soloists, large mixed chorus, children's choir and orchestra, features a vocal text compiled from writings in Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Arabic and other languages and translated into English ''to show the commonalities with which all these traditions resonate,'' Mr. Glass said. The libretto traverses the Tibetan Book of the Dead, aboriginal and African chants and the writings of the American religious thinker Thomas Merton, as well as those of rabbis, mullahs and Catholic and Anglican priests.</p>

        <p>Philip Glass's Symphony No. 5, an exploration of spiritual traditions through the ages, will open the Brooklyn Academy of Music's 2000 Next Wave Festival on Oct. 4.</p>
        <p>The symphony, a 12-movement work scored for five soloists, large mixed chorus, children's choir and orchestra, features a vocal text compiled from writings in Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Arabic and other languages and translated into English ''to show the commonalities with which all these traditions resonate,'' Mr. Glass said. The libretto traverses the Tibetan Book of the Dead, aboriginal and African chants and the writings of the American religious thinker Thomas Merton, as well as those of rabbis, mullahs and Catholic and Anglican priests.</p>
        <p>A co-production by the Brooklyn Academy and the Brooklyn Philharmonic, Symphony No. 5 will open the orchestra's 2000-01 season and will be conducted by Dennis Russell Davies, who directed its premiere last August at the Salzburg Festival. Mr. Davies, the orchestra's former principal conductor, has led the premieres of all five Glass symphonies.</p>
        <p>The work, which is to be performed through Oct. 7, is the first of five based on spiritual topics that will appear throughout the festival's 18th season. On Oct. 24, Ralph Lemon's ''Geography Trilogy'' moves forward with the New York premiere of Part 2, ''Tree.'' Through dance, music and storytelling, ''Tree'' delves into the relationship between art and the preservation of ancient traditions in an ever-shrinking world. Running through Oct. 28, the work was produced by the Yale Repertory Theater and Cross Performance Inc.</p>
        <p>The director Ratan Thiyam and his Chorus Repertory Theater of Manipur, India, will make their New York debut with their 1996 war play ''Uttar-Priyadarshi'' (''The Final Beatitude),'' based on the story of the second-century B.C. Indian emperor Ashoka, Oct. 25-28. The Cloud Gate Dance Theater of Taiwan returns to the academy for the first time since 1995 with Lin Hwai-min's ''Songs of the Wanderers,'' a dance-theater piece inspired by Herman Hesse's novel ''Siddhartha'' and set on a stage covered with rice. Performances are Nov. 1-5. Both productions are co-presentations with the Asia Society.</p>
        <p>The festival's theater program begins Oct. 4 with the SITI Company production of ''War of the Worlds,'' a look at the life and work of Orson Welles. Conceived by Anne Bogart and written by Naomi Iizuka, the work takes its name from Welles's panic-producing 1938 radio production.</p>
        <p>Robert Wilson's production of ''A Dream Play'' transposes Strindberg's ideas into the digital age by reordering time, space and narrative. The United States premiere production, which begins Nov. 28 and features a cast of 17 actors in multiple parts, is a collaboration with the Stadsteater of Stockholm.</p>
        <p>Other productions include ''Maquina Hamlet'' (''Hamlet Machine''), the El Periferico de Objetos production of Heiner Muller's 1977 play, in which Shakespeare's hapless prince is transported from 16th-century Denmark to the 1980's, Oct. 18-21, and Olivier Py's ''Requiem for Srebrenica,'' a response to the July 1995 Bosnian massacre, Nov. 8-11.</p>
        <p>Two dance ensembles will celebrate their 25th-anniversary seasons with festival performances: the Lucinda Childs Dance Company in ''Parcours,'' a collection of new and reconstructed works by the Judson Dance Theater pioneer, Oct. 11-15, and ''When Nights Were Dark,'' a meditation on time by the avant-garde duo Eiko and Koma, Nov. 29-Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>The festival will also honor the rock musician Jimi Hendrix on the 30th anniversary of his death. ''A Magic Science: Celebrating Jimi Hendrix'' examines the evolving music of the guitarist, singer and composer through performances by Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, the Gil Evans Orchestra and Vernon Reid, accompanied by a psychedelic light show designed by Glenn McKay. The production, Oct. 20-21, is the first of three to be rooted in rock 'n' roll.</p>
        <p>Starting on Dec. 6, David Dorfman Dance will perform ''To Lie Tenderly,'' a full-length work inspired by the genre's ''rule-breaking spirit.'' The festival closes Dec. 10 with the Bang on a Can Millennium Marathon, eight hours of eclectic music performed by 103 musicians from 12 countries.</p>
