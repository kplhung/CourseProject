        <p>DREAM STUFF  By David Malouf  185 pages. Pantheon. $22.</p>
        <p>No contemporary literature is more insistently permeated by the spirit of the land than Australia's.</p>
        <p>It is a spirit, though, that instead of forming and fortifying, deforms and weakens. In the works of such novelists as Rodney Hall, Janette Turner Hospital and David Malouf, the setting is a canvas whose chemical makeup reacts upon the figures painted on it, causing the pigment to wrinkle and curl away.</p>
        <p>''The land was not ours before we were not the land's.'' So an unlikely Australian Robert Frost might have written. A harsh, even weird geography -- the vast barren outback, Martian rock formations, rivers that narrowed instead of widening seaward and sometimes disappeared altogether -- resisted settlers who pushed beyond the narrow coastal belt.</p>
        <p>The difficulty was more than material. What the writers and some filmmakers register is a flaw of morale, a vulnerability of the imagination. They evoke the sense of inhabiting a geographical and historical fault line, haunted by aboriginal ghosts that the settlers' culture, availing itself of massacre and repression, was never sufficiently confident of its own identity to dislodge. (What a contrast with the confidently indifferent majority tradition of Americans.) Most of the Australian settlers had arrived from Britain not as pilgrims but as penal deportees; not having sought freedom, but having lost it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malouf, the finest and most expansive of these writers, shares some of their darkly violent images of estrangement. In his best and most recent work, though (the novels  ''Remembering Babylon'' and ''The Conversations at Curlow Creek''), he goes beyond the stranger-in-a-strange-land theme to suggest with a few of his characters a beginning of wisdom, a rumor of reconciliation.</p>
        <p>It is a note he shares to an extent with Michael Ondaatje. In different ways, each launches upon the tidal wave of nightmare a tiny raft-borne human figure, paddling if not prevailing.</p>
        <p>Several of the short stories in ''Dream Stuff'' evoke the curse of landscape and history with no reconciliation at all. In ''Lone Pine,'' an elderly couple on vacation are brutally murdered by a young tough who, with his wife and child, forces his way into their camper to steal it, walks them out into the woods and shoots them. What in another context would be a breath-stopping account of a sadistic crime -- Mr. Malouf remarkably manages to make the pity even more stunning than the terror -- here seems more than that. It seems foreordained.</p>
        <p>''Blacksoil Country,'' set more than a century ago, is the finest story in the collection, a precursor, perhaps, of ''Remembering Babylon.'' It tells of MacIvor, a rough, bitter farmer who moves from homestead to homestead without making a go of any of them. His failures build into rage against the itinerant bands of aborigines who wander across his property following their ancestral routes. The practice has become a kind of right, respected if not welcomed by the other farmers.</p>
        <p>MacIvor, though, threatens them with a shotgun until one day, seeing a band approach with a dead sheep and assuming they've poached it, he shoots one of them dead. It is blind and tragically senseless; another settler, hoping to calm his neighbor, had given the aborigines the sheep to bring as a peace offering.</p>
        <p>The truce is broken. Jordan, Mac Ivor's 12-year-old son, who until then had wandered the countryside free and unharmed, is killed by the aborigines. The white farmers, reluctantly perhaps, start a season of pursuit and massacre.</p>
        <p>The story is told -- and it is Malouf's triumph -- in Jordan's wondering, dead voice. Double victimhood makes him one of the writer's wraithlike reconcilers:</p>
        <p>''The blacks in every direction are hunted and go to ground. They too have lost their protection -- what little they had of it. And me all that while lying quiet in the heart of the country, slowly sinking into the ancientness of it, making it mine, grain by grain blending my white grains with its many black ones.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Malouf's engine may be overpowered for a short track. There are clever turns in many of the stories but a certain tire shriek on corners. The ones furthest from his theme of haunted unsettlement seem most contrived.</p>
        <p>''Sally's Story,'' set during World War II, portrays the alienated feelings of an Australian woman employed to provide weeklong ''marriages'' to American soldiers on combat leave. The situation is journalistically provocative, at least to an American reader (Who employed these women? Was it an official program?), but the story is sketchy and flat.</p>
        <p>''Night Training'' is a slight piece about a studious draftee sadistically abused by his training officer.  ''Jacko's Reach'' is a nostalgic sketch of the conversion into a shopping mall of a bit of city wasteland used for teenage adventures with drink, drugs and sex. More interesting is the title story, but its attempt to compress in 30 pages the memories and emotions of an expatriate writer returning for a visit and getting mugged suffers from forcing. Too much is signaled, too little received.</p>
        <p>''Great Day,'' by contrast, gives expansive range to its story of the passing of a class and a generation.  It takes the form of the annual reunion of a privileged and gifted clan to celebrate the birthday of Audley Tyler, its patriarch. He is a man of discriminating temper and shrewd judgment, formerly the highest of civil servants and adviser to six prime ministers, and still much consulted.</p>
        <p>Individual vignettes weave through the reunion; a familiar device that Mr. Malouf employs effectively, though with more power than subtlety. It develops a lovely grave complexity, nonetheless, as Audley presides over not only the reunion but also his own stock-taking.</p>
        <p>His brief, restless visit to the nearby family museum adumbrates the frailty of privilege and its mementos. (Museums are levelers: whether an old court dress or an old shepherd's tunic, the governing word is ''old.'') It evokes Audley's own aging weariness with who he is. Mr. Malouf touches, though indirectly, on his abiding theme: how frailly the conquerors, about to become ghosts themselves, have inhabited this ghost-ridden land.</p>
