        <p>A Film Prize And a Baby, Too</p>
        <p>''I'm 39,'' said JOAN STEIN, who won the gold medal for the best narrative film at the Student Academy Awards last month, along with the Directors Guild of America's Student Film Award. ''It's nice to be considered an up-and-coming young filmmaker and have everybody asking how old I am, but it's such an ageist industry. I don't feel old; I feel like I've worked hard to get to this stage in my life. I feel like the film reflects my life and experiences and thoughts and dreams.''</p>
        <p>The 25-minute film, ''One Day Crossing,'' was her master's thesis at Columbia University. CHRISTINA LAZZARIDI, a screenwriter who graduated from the Columbia film program two years ago and who worked with Ms. Stein on ''One Day Crossing,'' accepted the student award at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, Calif. The $2,000 prize went to Spike Lee, Trey Parker and Robert Zemeckis early in their careers. Ms. Stein had to skip the trip to California: she is eight months pregnant.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stein arrived at Columbia after three years in Budapest as a management consultant (her undergraduate major was in economics and her first master's degree was in business administration).</p>
        <p>''There I was, living in Budapest and hearing about genocide and ethnic cleansing, being mortified what was happening,'' she said. ''I started volunteering. We were organizing games, activities for the kids, and I started videotaping them. I met some filmmakers from Sarajevo who made me realize this was important.''</p>
        <p>''One Day Crossing'' is about a family in Budapest at the end of World War II. ''Although the film is a work of fiction,'' said Ms. Stein, whose parents lived through the war there, ''the story behind it stems from experiences very close to my heart. I never really understood the inexpressible shadow that the Holocaust cast over me my whole life. The film is an attempt to make some sense of the experience for those who survived and those who didn't.''</p>
        <p>Voice of the Past, And It's His</p>
        <p>''Today the theater looks to the young composers who may become the Youmans of their day,'' declares the voice on what is billed as a ''bonus track'' to the 1954 original-cast recording of ''The Pajama Game,'' which was re-issued last month. The name ''Youmans'' would have been familiar to theatergoers 46 years ago: Vincent Youmans collaborated with everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Oscar Hammerstein II and wrote the songs for ''No, No, Nanette'' and other hits.</p>
        <p>The voice that read the sentence about Youmans sounded familiar, and sure enough, it belonged to MIKE WALLACE. The 57-second excerpt on the recording -- an interview with Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, who wrote the music and lyrics for ''The Pajama Game'' -- came from a radio program called ''Stage Struck'' that featured Mr. Wallace as the host. The interview was recorded in Boston, three weeks before ''The Pajama Game'' opened on Broadway (and 14 years before '60 Minutes' went on the air).</p>
        <p>''I barely remember it,'' Mr. Wallace said the other day.</p>
        <p>He said that Columbia, which re-issued ''The Pajama Game'' and four other original-cast recordings last month, had sent him the compact disks. ''I put them on the shelf,'' he said. ''Then I thought, come on, for Pete's sake, listen to them. I promise you, I had very little memory of the interview, it's such a long, long time ago.''</p>
        <p>''Stage Struck,'' he said, was broadcast on Sunday afternoons and covered productions that were bound for Broadway. ''We would go out with the cast and cover what went on, either in New Haven or Philadelphia at tryouts, or at the recording of the album. It's so long ago, one of the people we chose as ingenue of the year and featured was Eva Marie Saint in her first appearance on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Yes, but what about hearing himself again after so many years?</p>
        <p>''You cover all kinds of things as you grow up,'' he said. ''That was nearly 50 years ago.''</p>
