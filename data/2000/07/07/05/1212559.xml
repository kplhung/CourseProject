        <p>A Past Preserved</p>
        <p>After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1949, many works of Tibetan art and Buddhist manuscripts were destroyed. But others have slowly made their way to the West, and some of these have been donated by collectors to the Repatriation Collection of Tibet House, the 13-year-old nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of the country's culture. Beginning tomorrow with a reception in honor of the 65th birthday of the Dalai Lama, some 60 objects from the collection will go on view at the Tibet House Cultural Center on 22 West 15th Street in Manhattan. The show, ''Art Treasures From the Land of Snows,'' continues through Sept. 22.</p>

        <p>A Past Preserved</p>
        <p>After the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1949, many works of Tibetan art and Buddhist manuscripts were destroyed. But others have slowly made their way to the West, and some of these have been donated by collectors to the Repatriation Collection of Tibet House, the 13-year-old nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of the country's culture. Beginning tomorrow with a reception in honor of the 65th birthday of the Dalai Lama, some 60 objects from the collection will go on view at the Tibet House Cultural Center on 22 West 15th Street in Manhattan. The show, ''Art Treasures From the Land of Snows,'' continues through Sept. 22.</p>
        <p>Musical Feast</p>
        <p>At 55 sites including churches, barns, concert halls and open-air locales beside the North Sea and the Baltic, the Schleswig-Hostein Music Festival opens on Saturday in Lubeck, Germany. The festival is to present 116 concerts before it ends on Aug. 27 in Kiel, where its chief conductor, Christoph Eschenbach, will lead works by Mahler and Strauss with the soprano Renee Fleming as soloist. This year's focus is ''New World-Old World: America in the Interplay With Europe.'' Among the scheduled participants are the Houston Symphony Orchestra; the London Philharmonic Orchestra; the English Baroque Soloists; the violinists Shlomo Mintz and Nigel Kennedy; the pianists Alfred Brendel, Emanuel Ax and Richard Goode; and the cellist Janos Starker.</p>
        <p>Jazz Scholar</p>

Mr. Blanchard's primary role will be to provide artistic direction for the institute's Performance Ensemble, consisting of the young artists known as the Thelonious Monk Fellows.</p>
        <p>By the Waters</p>
        <p>Besides the free music, the attractions include the Statue of Liberty in the background and a refreshing breeze over the harbor.
