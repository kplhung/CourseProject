        <p>At Cafe Gigi in the East Village, the owner, Gigi Bella, presided over a score of empty tables yesterday afternoon. On most days, he said, there was usually a line of people waiting to get into his restaurant. ''I don't know where everyone went,'' he said. ''We thought the entire world was coming to New York this weekend. I guess they're watching the party on television.''</p>
        <p>Many Lower East Side residents said they were most struck by the absence of exploding fireworks -- illegal ones, that is. Once, they said, the Fourth of July meant two days of jarring noise. But over the last five years, the Police and Fire Departments have enforced a zero-tolerance policy on illegal fireworks. By yesterday afternoon, there had been no Independence Day fireworks arrests, said Detective Madelyne Galindo, a Police Department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Mark Davies, 36, an Internet entrepreneur who has lived on Clinton Street since 1988, said he could not remember an Independence Day so tranquil. ''I was fully prepared for sleep deprivation,'' he said. ''But I haven't heard a single pop yet. To tell you the truth, it's very very bizarre.''</p>
