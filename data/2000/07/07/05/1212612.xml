        <p>As a stream of break points slipped through Lindsay Davenport's hands in the first and second sets, Monica Seles was experiencing a revival.</p>
        <p>She was sharp and focused and even daring. To take a 6-5 lead in the first set, Seles broke from her trademark two-fisted forehand and whipped a one-handed winner on the run past Davenport for game point. But Davenport would not crumble.

        <p>As a stream of break points slipped through Lindsay Davenport's hands in the first and second sets, Monica Seles was experiencing a revival.</p>
        <p>She was sharp and focused and even daring. To take a 6-5 lead in the first set, Seles broke from her trademark two-fisted forehand and whipped a one-handed winner on the run past Davenport for game point. But Davenport would not crumble. After blowing 13 consecutive break-point opportunities, she started stringing them together in the face of an increasingly fatigued Seles.</p>
        <p>Once she broke through, Davenport was able to finish off her quarterfinal today with a 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-0 victory that came beneath the buzz created after Venus Williams advanced to the semifinals to face her sister Serena. Quietly, Davenport, the defending Wimbledon champion, is another Grand Slam semifinal and will play Jelena Dokic.</p>
        <p>''I'm so happy to get through,'' Davenport said. ''I think most of all, I'm just really, really proud of the way I hung in there. It was just a few points in the first set that made the difference. In the second set, it was kind of on the same path for the first two games. I don't know, it was like 10 break points; and I didn't break. But I held my serve and I stayed focused and pulled it out.''</p>
        <p>Seles could not sustain the kind of early energy that turned back the page in the first set. For a moment, a slimmed-down Seles looked as she did before the stabbing, the death of her father and the countless injury setbacks she has had to endure. She was not the fading star, but the two-fisted wonder.</p>
        <p>''I thought once I started hitting the ball a bit better, she lost confidence, stopped serving as well,'' Davenport said. ''That kind of changed the tide of the match.''</p>
        <p>Davenport is part of an all-American semifinals -- except for one player. Davenport's next opponent is Dokic, a Yugoslav-born hard-hitter who resides in Australia. She is also a player with an impressive amount of tunnel vision after her father began the tournament with a tirade that ended up with his being led away by the police. But the 17-year old Dokic, who eased by Magui Serna, 6-3, 6-2, today, has ignored the circus. She is playing the best tennis of her young career. Is it enough?</p>
        <p>After all, Davenport is back up to speed.</p>
        <p>After missing two months with a back injury, Davenport's play has steadily improved since she returned in mid-May. Although she arrived at Wimbledon as the defending champion, she wasn't sure how she would hold up. But as the fortnight has moved along, Davenport's power game seems unaffected by her injury.</p>
        <p>''I really feel like I can place the ball a lot better this week than last week,'' Davenport said. ''The key was getting through those first few matches when I wasn't playing so well, and just give myself the opportunity to hang in this tournament and let my game get better and better. That's what happened.''</p>
        <p>As usual, the unassuming Davenport's tiptoe through the tournament has been kept under wraps.</p>
        <p>When asked if she was glad that the spotlight was on the Williams sisters, she just smiled and said, ''Yeah,'' as she made her exit at the end of a long but inspirational day.</p>

        <p>Navratilova and de Swardt Win</p>
        <p>WIMBLEDON, England, July 4 (AP) -- Martina Navratilova and Mariaan de Swardt are in the doubles quarterfinals at Wimbledon where they will face Venus and Serena Williams.</p>
        <p>Navratilova, who insists she is not chasing a record-tying 20 Wimbledon titles to match Billie Jean King but only playing for fun, teamed with de Swardt to overwhelm Amelie Mauresmo and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, 6-1, 6-1, today in 43 minutes.</p>
        <p>Navratilova won nine Wimbledon singles titles and seven women's doubles crowns before retiring in 1994, but decided a few months ago to make a limited comeback playing doubles with de Swardt.</p>
        <p>Coming into Wimbledon, it had been a struggle for the Navratilova and de Swardt with early defeats in Madrid, Paris and Eastbourne, England.</p>
