        <p>The recent conviction of 10 Iranian Jews in Iran on charges of spying for Israel is a brazen violation of international human rights standards and the due process of law. President Clinton and leaders of the European Union have rightly called on the Iranian government to overturn these unjust convictions.</p>
        <p>President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of Iran's reform movement, has been silent on this case, except to say that the prosecution and trial would be fair. That promise has proved illusory. He should condemn the verdicts and make clear he is dissatisfied with a warped legal system that is controlled by Iran's conservative clerics and used for judicial persecution.</p>

        <p>The recent conviction of 10 Iranian Jews in Iran on charges of spying for Israel is a brazen violation of international human rights standards and the due process of law. President Clinton and leaders of the European Union have rightly called on the Iranian government to overturn these unjust convictions.</p>
        <p>President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of Iran's reform movement, has been silent on this case, except to say that the prosecution and trial would be fair. That promise has proved illusory. He should condemn the verdicts and make clear he is dissatisfied with a warped legal system that is controlled by Iran's conservative clerics and used for judicial persecution.</p>
        <p>The spying charges against the Jews drew international attention because the charges were unfounded and the prosecution unfair. Iran's virulent hostility to Israel added to the impression that Jews had been singled out for political purposes.</p>
        <p>The 13 Jewish defendants, three of whom were acquitted, were imprisoned in March 1999 and not allowed access to lawyers until just weeks before their trial began in May. The trial was closed and the evidence against the men was kept secret. The defense lawyers say that there was no evidence against the men other than their own statements made during interrogations without the presence of legal counsel. Even after the trial, the court gave few details about the alleged illegal activities. The Jews were convicted of belonging to an illegal spy network, recruiting others and cooperating with Israel, though it was unclear what cooperation they could have given Israel.</p>
        <p>Political reformers, journalists and others disfavored by the religious hard-liners have also been victims of a system where judges act as investigators, prosecutors and judges in the same case. Mr. Khatami and his reformist supporters in Parliament say they want to depoliticize the courts. The Iranian people in the recent parliamentary elections showed they want relief from rigid fundamentalist rule. But progress for human rights in the face of the conservative clerics who hold power over the judiciary and the security forces is slow and fitful. This case shows how far Iran has to go to meet the expectations that Mr. Khatami has set.</p>
