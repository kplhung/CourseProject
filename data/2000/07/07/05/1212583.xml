        <p>A French prosecutor has begun a preliminary investigation into whether an American global surveillance system that listens in on millions of telephone calls, faxes and e-mails each day is a threat to French well-being.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Dintilhac, has ordered the French counterintelligence agency, called D.S.T., to appraise the actions of the system, named Echelon. The system links computers in at least seven sites around the world to receive, analyze and sort information captured from satellite communications.</p>
        <p>If the French agency finds the system ''harmful to the vital interests of the nation,'' legal proceedings could begin, though it is difficult to see how an American government agency could be sued in a French court.</p>
        <p>Still, the issue is taken very seriously in Europe. Many fear that America's vast surveillance system, developed in the cold war, is being used to further America's economic interests.</p>
        <p>American officials have repeatedly denied that. But the issue continues to arouse passions here. That is particularly true in France, where even Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou contended in February that cold war spy systems had been converted to ''economic espionage.''</p>
        <p>This year, the European Parliament held hearings on the subject, leading to an emotional debate. A report commissioned by the Parliament and written by a British journalist said there was evidence that the Echelon system had twice helped American companies gain an advantage over Europeans, though few details were provided. Some members of the Parliament expressed skepticism over the 18-page report. But others did not.</p>
        <p>Parliament is deciding whether to create a commission to continue its Echelon investigation.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Dintilhac, Marie-Annick Darmaillac, said the prosecutor had decided to begin his investigation after having received a letter from a member of the European Parliament who is a former French judge, Thierry Jean-Pierre. Ms. Darmaillac said the letter had enough information for the prosecutor to feel that an investigation was warranted. But she said she could not discuss what steps might be taken.</p>
        <p>In Strasbourg, Mr. Jean-Pierre told Agence France-Press that he believed that the Echelon system should be dismantled or that Europe should have a hand in governing it.</p>
        <p>''Echelon is used by the National Security Agency for strategic and economic gains,'' Mr. Jean-Pierre said. ''You cannot make me believe that the information is not passed on to American companies.''</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that France has reacted to allegations of American spying. In 1995, France expelled five American diplomats and other officials, one of them the reported Paris station chief for the Central Intelligence Agency, in connection with the spying case.</p>
        <p>It is clear that many Europeans are particularly galled that the British are partners of the United States in the Echelon system.</p>
        <p>Recently declassified information shows that Echelon is a network of surveillance stations stitched together in the 1970's by the United States with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The system listens and watches for key words on a topic requested by a country. Some experts have said the most extravagant claims against the Echelon system make little sense, because the N.S.A. is overwhelmed by the proliferation of information over the Internet.</p>
        <p>It is widely believed that France operates its own surveillance system, one that some people have called ''Frenchelon.'' It is believed to be much smaller than the American system. But it is thought to do much the same activity -- eavesdropping on private and public communications.</p>
