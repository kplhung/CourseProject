Beloved son of Sarah and Jacob, he was the youngest brother of Rebecca, Al, Lou, Irving and Pearl. Adored by his wife Harriet, and his children, the late Susan and David, Abe was devoted to his family including his wife's mother, Anna Bloch, her twin sister Charlotte Schecter, his three wonderful nieces, Gail, Diane and Debbie, his daughter-inlaw Dorothy, and his beloved grandchildren, Joey, Daniel and Jenny. There was no limit to his generosity, love of learning, loyalty, friendship, and devotion to Judaism. He will be sorely missed by everyone whose life he touched from the Bethlehem Hebrew Congregation to the Jewish Communal Center in Brooklyn to Temple Gates of Prayer in Flushing. He is survived by his loving son, David, and his three grandchildren. Services Thursday, July 6, at 9:30 AM at Sinai Chapels, 162-05 Horace Harding Expressway, Flushing, New York.
