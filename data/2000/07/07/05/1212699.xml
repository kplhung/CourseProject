      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Tall and lanky, with a voice that occasionally cracks and a forelock that resists conformity. All in all, he presents himself as the perfect young man to escort your daughter to the junior prom: he would obey the speed limit, attempt nothing more than a peck on the cheek, and studiously avoid the rum raisin ice cream for dessert.</p>
        <p>But Rick A. Lazio is 42 years old, not 18. Despite the gee-whiz air about him, he is old enough to have a wife, two daughters and a weekend beach house; eight years as a Republican congressman; and the brash self-confidence to square off against Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's high-wattage race for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Advisers have warned Mrs. Clinton that in many ways, Mr. Lazio presents more of a challenge than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the putative candidate he so gleefully replaced two months ago. He has a palpable ambition that infuses him with energy, a gift for negotiation, and that rare ability, shared by her husband, to connect with a savvy lobbyist in Washington and some teenager working a pizza oven in his native Long Island.</p>
        <p>Above all, they say, he is a nice guy, with little in his personal life to titillate the curious and suspicious. He rarely socializes and spends most of his free time with his family.</p>
        <p>Sherwood L. Boehlert, a Republican congressman from Utica, N.Y., and his wife were recently watching a televised scene from a political rally that showed an aide gripping Mr. Lazio by the arm and leading him off stage. The candidate broke loose, Mr. Boehlert recalled, went back to take the hand of his wife, Patricia, and walked away with her by his side.</p>
        <p>''That was very important to my wife,'' he said. ''I'll tell you, that was a heady position he was in. And yet he stops, grabs his wife's hand and walks off together. That's not manufactured. That's real.''</p>
        <p>But those who know him say that a certain calculation lurks behind his smile. He promotes himself in a way that unnerves colleagues. He is well-known for waiting until the last moment to cast his vote; while supporters say it reflects a deliberate approach to lawmaking, detractors say it shows a penchant for pandering to the Republican leadership.</p>
        <p>Then there is the question of the Lazio ideology. Although considered to be a moderate Republican, his positions, from gun control to abortion, can seem oh-so-carefully nuanced. Peter T. King, an outspoken Republican colleague from Long Island, said he doubted whether Mr. Lazio was guided by any particular philosophy.</p>
        <p>''He's basically a facilitator, a mediator, a fine-tuner,'' Mr. King said. ''He tries to make things work a little better, but it's not out of any real ideological base.''</p>
        <p>Lloyd Braun, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Television Group, said he had a different take on his former college roommate, a man he loves and teases ''like a brother.'' For all his boyish qualities, he said, Mrs. Clinton's opponent is as hard-driven as they come -- and ''very, very pragmatic.''</p>
        <p>Early Lessons in Responsibility</p>
        <p>Rick Lazio inherited that pragmatism from his father, Anthony Lazio, who worked long hours in the automotive parts store he owned, then spent many nights making contacts through the local Kiwanis club and the Suffolk County Republican clique. The lesson imparted was that little comes to those who relax.</p>
        <p>Anthony Lazio had met his wife in the mid-1950's when he serendipitously stepped on the foot of Olive Christensen, the daughter of Danish immigrants living in Brooklyn. ''It must be a family thing,'' Rick Lazio joked, referring to his own lip-splitting stumble at a recent Memorial Day parade.</p>
        <p>Both were veterans of World War II, single parents -- he was a widower with one daughter, and she was divorced, with two daughters -- and rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fans, which prompted a romantic trip to Ebbets Field that eventually led to marriage. They settled down in a small Cape Cod house in middle-class West Islip on Long Island's South Shore. It was just a few miles east of Lindenhurst, where his Sicilian parents, a seamstress and a man who dabbled with unsuccessful inventions, ran a dress shop out of their house on Montauk Highway.</p>
        <p>In March 1958, the couple had their first child together: Enrico Anthony Lazio, named after his paternal grandfather. Mr. Lazio later joked that when his teachers conducted roll call -- ''Mary, Jane, Paul, Bill, Enrico!'' -- other children would look to see ''who's the new exchange student.''</p>
        <p>He was the baby in the family, doted on by his parents and three older sisters. To hear Mr. Lazio tell it, his childhood was normal and healthy, but hardly a free ride. Yes, his family owned a beach house on Fire Island. Yes, he played Little League and collected stacks of baseball cards. Yes, they installed a floodlight over his basketball hoop so that he could mimic Walt Frazier late into the night.</p>
        <p>But he never received an allowance, he said. Instead, his father made him earn spending money by stocking shelves and sweeping the floor at the family store.</p>
        <p>The younger Lazio also played down his father's role in politics. ''He would be one of the guys who would put the signs up and carry the petitions,'' he said. ''And then when you had some sort of visiting bigwig come into town, he'd be the guy who would be asked to go pick him up at the airport and bring him in.''</p>
        <p>But Edwin M. Schwenk, the Suffolk County Republican chairman from 1967 to 1977, remembered Tony Lazio as playing a significant role. The party paid Mr. Lazio about $26,000 a year, he said, to coordinate elaborate fund-raising dinners that often included a formal program and a three-tier dais.</p>
        <p>''He made everybody think that Suffolk County was important, and he convinced them to come, including the vice president, Spiro Agnew,'' Mr. Schwenk said, adding: ''And he wasn't bashful about telling me what a good job he did.''</p>
        <p>The younger Lazio minimized the role of politics in his childhood, saying he did little more than attend a few rallies. As for Republican patronage, he said, his father would help friends secure summer jobs on the public beach, but his son's assignments would be ''the lousiest'': hauling garbage or working on the mosquito-control unit.</p>
        <p>About this time, his future political opponent, Mrs. Clinton, was a young lawyer working for the House Judiciary Committee. Her task: preparing for the impeachment of one of the Lazio family's heroes, President Nixon.</p>
        <p>Choosing His Causes</p>
        <p>The West Islip High School yearbook in the bicentennial year 1976 includes a photograph of a grinning graduate named Enrico Lazio sporting a striking white bow tie. His listed accomplishments included membership in the Coin and Stamp Club and something called the Leaders Club.</p>
        <p>''The Leaders Club was like a group of people that were picked to -- what did we do? -- we sort of led,'' Mr. Lazio said, laughing and cringing simultaneously.</p>
        <p>He was not the kind of teenager to sneak a six-pack of Schmidt's beer down to the Babylon docks; nor was his high school's coin club likely to rumble with rowdy numismatists from, say, Bay Shore High School. He followed the Mets, hung out in friends' basements, spent time clamming off the Fire Island shores.</p>
        <p>That fall, he began to attend Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which had begun to admit men only seven years earlier. Vassar retains a whiff of its upper-crust past to this day; afternoon tea is still served under gold chandeliers in the Rose Parlor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he chose Vassar because it was relatively close to home, had a small-school feel and offered him some latitude in choosing course work. The disproportionate women-to-men ratio, he added, ''certainly wasn't a negative.''</p>
        <p>There he was, a political science major in Lacoste shirts and Top-Siders, dressed like a preppy but not a true preppy, more interested in Tom Seaver than in Mary McCarthy, a wide-eyed product of what he later called a ''lily-white middle-class background.''</p>
        <p>At some point he tried marijuana, he said, but those who knew him then say he was hardly one to join others in beginning their weekends with Thursday-night pitchers of beer. He and his friends spent most of their time competing in cutthroat games of Risk, basketball and all-around teasing, but he was neither the sharpest-tongued nor the most athletically gifted.</p>
        <p>''You could easily give him a pass and it would hit him in the head,'' Mr. Braun, his former roommate, said.</p>
        <p>The conservative kid from West Islip gradually revealed himself on the liberal-leaning campus. He was the campus coordinator for Youth for Ford -- ''a pretty small group of volunteers, as you can imagine,'' he said -- fought for more student input in faculty evaluations and lost in the election for senior class president.</p>
        <p>''Did I think perhaps one day I would run for public office?'' he said. ''Yeah, I thought that.''</p>
        <p>Such aspirations were obvious to those around him. ''Lazio was always understanding of the things you cannot do if you want to have a career in politics,'' said Michael Naso, another former roommate. ''He was conservative in his actions because he knew where he was going.''</p>
        <p>When talk turned to national politics, Mr. Lazio passionately argued that Nixon had been railroaded. But he would not immerse himself in some stickier issues, as when many on campus erupted in protest over the college's investments with banks that did business with the apartheid government of South Africa.</p>
        <p>''Rick was not on the map for any of that,'' said Dimitri Cruz, a graduate who was active in campus politics. ''In that sense, Rick chooses very carefully when to present himself, when to express his views, when to assert himself.''</p>
        <p>For all the appearance of being focused, Mr. Lazio was more than a little distracted. In late 1978, his father suffered a severe stroke from which he would never fully recover; doctors told the family that Tony Lazio would never get out of bed, and would probably remain in a vegetative state.</p>
        <p>The prognosis failed to account for the determination of a man who eventually willed himself to walk a few steps with a cane, Mr. Lazio said, recalling, ''He pushed it as hard as anyone could imagine.''</p>
        <p>College friends recall visiting the Lazio house to spend time at the nearby beaches and to help their friend with his father, assisting him in his physical therapy and  using flash cards to help him regain his speech -- Tony Lazio was so affected by the stroke that only family members seemed to understand him.</p>
        <p>''It was not a house of remorse,'' recalled Steve Kluger, another former roommate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also worked to keep his father in touch with the Republican clique that once meant so much to him. Sometime during Mr. Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980, he said, he put a note ''in somebody's hand who put it in somebody's hand,'' asking that Mr. Reagan mention his father during a Long Island rally.</p>
        <p>He later said he just wanted the celebrity to point to the man in the wheelchair and say: ''Tony Lazio, glad you're here.''</p>
        <p>It did not happen. But the next morning, Mr. Reagan called the Lazio house to apologize, saying that he had received the letter only after he had left the rally. Then Olive Lazio held up the phone, Mr. Lazio said, so that her husband could hear the future president tell him ''how much he meant to the party, meant to the nation, the community.''</p>
        <p>Remembering how the call thrilled his father, Rick Lazio said: ''It was a nice thing to do, something that didn't need to be done. My dad -- it was a nice thing to do.''</p>
        <p>One day, two young men from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Michael Moriarty, were studying at American University School of Law in Washington when, according to Mr. Lazio, an acquaintance came up to his friend and said: ''Hey, man, Moriarty, I saw your sister. She's pretty good-looking, man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he felt betrayed; he had been driving Mr. Moriarty home for a couple of years and yet knew nothing of this sister. ''When am I meeting her?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moriarty, now a lawyer in Manhattan but forever an older brother, decided such a meeting made sense.</p>
        <p>''He had a seriousness that a lot of other guys didn't have, a sense of where he wanted to go,'' Mr. Moriarty said, which was reflected by Mr. Lazio's dedication to his family. ''What he was doing was not what a lot of unmarried guys in their early 20's wanted to spend their time doing.''</p>
        <p>It was arranged for some law school students, among them Mr. Lazio, to meet some nurses, including Patricia Moriarty, at a bar near George Washington University Medical Center. The son of a Suffolk County politico started talking with the daughter of a New York City police officer, then walked her to the hospital, where she was working the night shift.</p>
        <p>''It probably took him about a good month to call,'' she later said. And so began a slow-paced relationship.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Lazio's interest in someday running for office had grown so strong that he wrote a letter to James L. Buckley, a conservative former New York senator, seeking advice -- a brash move that yielded a lunch meeting. While becoming a prosecutor was an honorable choice, he recalled the veteran politician telling him, someone interested in elective office should work instead on a few campaigns.</p>
        <p>''Of course, I did just the opposite,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>He landed a summer job with Patrick Henry, the Suffolk County district attorney and a Republican. ''He had known my dad,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''And I'm sure -- though he never said it -- I'm sure it probably had something to do with that he felt that it was a nice thing to do for somebody in need.''</p>
        <p>By now, Mrs. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas, a prominent lawyer and the mother of a toddler named Chelsea. And Mr. Lazio was on the verge of becoming an assistant district attorney who each morning packed the court papers he needed and the lunch prepared by his mother.</p>
        <p>''It was always a nice sandwich with lettuce and some healthy fruit,'' recalled Marcy Rudner Flores, who shared a cubicle with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''Raisins,'' Mr. Lazio said sheepishly. ''The transitional food: not quite a candy or a fruit.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flores recalled Mr. Lazio's being the office ''golden boy'' who was always there to encourage others. Mr. Henry, now a State Supreme Court justice, described him as an able prosecutor who rose to become the office's executive assistant -- and an attentive son, often seen pushing his father in a wheelchair at Republican events.</p>
        <p>In October 1985, Mr. Lazio won a conviction in a felony case against the ringleader of a major bootleg record album business. The next month, his father died, at 65. The obituary in Newsday included a statement from former President Nixon that said, in part that ''the Nixon family has lost a good friend.''</p>
        <p>It was a generous gesture, Mr. Lazio said, considering that Nixon barely knew his father.</p>
        <p>The Road to Congress</p>
        <p>In late summer 1988, Mr. Lazio left the district attorney's office to open a general practice law firm in Babylon. It was time, he later said, to get on with his life.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there was Patricia Moriarty, whose photograph he kept on his desk. The casual long-distance relationship had recently become more serious. She said she told him, ''You need to make a decision.''</p>
        <p>''He thought about it long and hard, and we stopped dating for a couple of months,'' she said. ''Then he came back one day and said: 'I really thought about this. I want to marry, but I'm not ready at this point.' ''</p>
        <p>A month later, in January 1989, Mr. Lazio proposed at the Rainbow Room. They would marry in June the following year and move into a ranch house in Brightwaters, just three miles east of his mother's house.</p>
        <p>Then there were his political aspirations. Mr. Henry, his former boss, was stepping down amid a state investigation into the office's sloppy practices. And so Mr. Lazio, all of 30 years old, spread the word that he wanted to run for district attorney.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party committee instead chose James M. Catterson, a man almost twice Mr. Lazio's age, but strongly hinted that he had a future.</p>
        <p>A few months later, in the fall of 1989, he easily won an open seat in the Suffolk County Legislature, thus joining an 18-member panel known for preferring an in-your-face style of democracy. Shouting is common. A member once struck a colleague with a pocketbook; another once dropped some tissues on an opponent's desk, a sly reference to tears shed during a previous argument.</p>
        <p>Rarely participating in the grandstanding was the gentleman from West Islip, who was exceedingly friendly and always immaculately dressed. Alan Binder, a legislator, remembered being so obsessed with the perfect dimple in Mr. Lazio's tie that he confronted his colleague in a parking lot and demanded that he share his sartorial talent.</p>
        <p>''Since then,'' he said, ''I have had a dimple in my tie.''</p>
        <p>Although his party had the majority in the County Legislature, some former colleagues say that Mr. Lazio's legacy does not go much beyond the dimple now found in Mr. Binder's tie.</p>
        <p>''He worked to not get out in front of the controversial issues,'' Paul Sabatino, a Republican and the counsel to the County Legislature, recalled. ''He was a pleasant person, but he left no fingerprints.''</p>
        <p>Sondra M. Bachety, a former Democratic leader in the Legislature who sat next to Mr. Lazio, agreed. ''He would speak about things and sound very sincere, but I never found him to be a stand-up guy in that respect,'' she said. ''He didn't take the tough votes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio cited several accomplishments, from helping to revitalize downtown Bay Shore to working to recognize the sacrifice of reservists during Desert Storm. Besides, he said, he served only one two-year term. In 1992, during his second term, he ran for Congress against a fellow West Islip High School graduate who had become a Washington institution: Tom Downey.</p>
        <p>After 18 years in office, Mr. Downey, who was usually elected by huge margins, was one of the most effective members of Congress and served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Back on Long Island, however, more than a few thought he had become distant, too caught up with the clubbiness of Congress.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk Republican leadership basically told Rick Lazio the eager politician: go ahead, kid, give it a shot. But shortly afterward, the same leadership delivered a message to Rick Lazio the legislator: support its budget bailout package, a plan that included an increase in the sales tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio refused on principle, he said, and not because he was concerned about how a vote for a tax increase would hurt him on Election Day. He simply did not like borrowing money for operating costs.</p>
        <p>But many said the county had no choice, including Michael D. O'Donohoe, the conservative Republican who headed the Finance Committee at the time. ''He kept saying there must be another way,'' said Mr. O'Donohoe, ''which used to drive me up the wall.''</p>
        <p>The bailout package eventually passed, but not before Republican leaders vowed to get even. When the Lazio campaign held a large fund-raising dinner at LaSalle Military Academy in Oakdale, prominent Republicans boycotted the event, leaving the uneaten canapes to remind him that he could expect only lukewarm support.</p>
        <p>The Republican freeze-out of 1992 has become part of the Lazio lore, feeding the legend that he was a David to Mr. Downey's Goliath.</p>
        <p>In fact, he received significant financial help from a national Republican operation that smelled blood. And he waged an aggressive campaign that belied his boyish manner, accusing Mr. Downey of abusing his position by overdrawing checks from the House bank, of overusing his mailing privileges and of taking government-sponsored junkets. (Such trips are common, but ABC News had recently broadcast images of Mr. Downey on a Jet Ski during one such trip to Barbados.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Downey said recently that Mr. Lazio was ''an affable, friendly fellow,'' but that ''when you scratched the surface, there was not a lot there.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he said, ''I made mistakes -- the trip to Barbados, the House banking scandal -- and the economy was in such poor shape.''</p>
        <p>In retrospect, Mr. Downey said, the myth that Mr. Lazio was woefully underfinanced galls him the most. The national Republican leadership had dedicated ''extraordinary resources'' to the race, he said. ''The amount of money he spent made a material difference.''</p>
        <p>Richard N. Bond, who was then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, declined to say how much was spent on the Lazio campaign. But, he added, ''I took it as my cause to do everything within legal boundaries to fund that race.''</p>
        <p>In late January 1993, the country had a new president, Bill Clinton, and a new first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And the Second Congressional District of New York had a new representative, a gangly young man with a beguiling smile and a reputation as a giant-killer. His new Republican colleagues bathed him in applause.</p>
        <p>Alliances and Ambitions</p>
        <p>Eight years in Congress have matured Rick Lazio, beyond the gray hair just now appearing at his temples. He is the representative credited with steering a law to overhaul the federal public-housing policy; the mediator between the conservative Republican leadership and the moderate members known as the ''lunch bunch''; a deputy majority whip.</p>
        <p>Paul A. Equale, a prominent insurance lobbyist who generally supports Democrats, said of Mr. Lazio: ''Unlike many of them, he really gets his hands dirty in terms of legislative issues. He gives direction to his staff, not the other way around. He understands both the politics and the policy, and is generally working hard on both.''</p>
        <p>And the traits that he first exhibited during his years at Vassar -- establishing many relationships, avoiding controversy, choosing his causes -- have served him well.</p>
        <p>With the Democrats controlling the House his first two years, he often supported the policies of President Clinton. In 1994, when Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took control, he became more conservative. When several Republican factions were vying for the House leadership in 1998, he lobbied hard for the majority leader, Dick Armey, a rock-solid conservative from Texas who is rarely mistaken as a friend to the interests of the Northeast.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Lazio's credentials as a moderate are sometimes called into question. In late 1998, for example, he surprised many in his district by voting for two of the four articles of impeachment against his future opponent's husband.</p>
        <p>Critics say that his alliance with Mr. Armey smacks of opportunism and forces him to lean conservative on tough votes, but Mr. Lazio is unapologetic. Friendship is at the root of a relationship that also helps him in his legislative duties, he said: ''You have the ability to be around the leadership table and provide another perspective.''</p>
        <p>And for all of Mr. Lazio's persona as Everybody's Friend, he has had his share of battles over the years and is known for being a demanding, driven boss. ''I'm not a yeller,'' he said, ''but I'm pretty demanding.''</p>
        <p>There is also that bubbling ambition, reflected in the way he persisted in promoting himself as a Senate candidate -- even after the state Republican leadership cast its lot with Mr. Giuliani -- and in the way he seeks publicity.</p>
        <p>Some of his New York colleagues still grumble that he took most of the credit for getting federal reimbursement for the money Suffolk County spent in the aftermath of the Trans World Airlines Flight 800 disaster. They say that Representative Michael P. Forbes deserved credit for seeking the appropriation; besides, the plane crash was in Mr. Forbes's district.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't going to happen with Mike Forbes,'' Mr. Lazio said of the appropriation. ''Trust me.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in finally winning what he has lusted for these last few years -- the Republican nomination for Senate -- Mr. Lazio is learning that every photo opportunity, every vote, every move, is under scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into a profitable investment he made a few years ago, and even his struggle to restrain that disobedient forelock has become newsworthy.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mr. Lazio seems to be moving even faster than usual. Dimitri Cruz recalled seeing his old Vassar classmate at their 20th reunion last month. ''We gave each other a hug, said hello,'' he said. ''And he kept on running, kept shaking hands.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 12, 2000, Wednesday  An article last Wednesday about the career of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, misquoted Marcy Rudner Flores, a prosecutor who once worked with Mr. Lazio at the Suffolk County District Attorney's office. Ms. Flores said of Mr. Lazio, ''He wasn't like a golden boy. He was one of the guys.'' Ms. Flores did not say that Mr. Lazio was the office ''golden boy.''</p>
