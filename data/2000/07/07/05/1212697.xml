        <p>At 10 a.m. yesterday, lifeguards on the 14 stands at Orchard Beach in the Bronx went on duty. They stood and blew their whistles in unison, and crowds of children dashed into the water.</p>
        <p>At a grassy picnic area next to the beach's parking lot, Jose Urbina concentrated on the steaks and chicken he was grilling for his friends and family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Urbina likes to spend the Fourth of July at this picnic area celebrating his dual heritage with other Puerto Ricans. So to secure a good spot, he and his group left Hoboken at 4 a.m. and took the train to Manhattan. They took two more trains and a bus to arrive at Orchard Beach at 6:30. They set up camp under the oak trees and lit the barbecue coals by 7. By 8, the steaks were cooked medium-well, the rice and beans and pasteles were served and bottles of Heineken were pulled from the cooler.</p>
        <p>Mr. Urbina said he used to run his own barbershop near San Juan and was earning less now, working in a Jersey City shop. But he prefers America's diverse population.</p>
        <p>''There, you just see Puerto Ricans,'' he said, as ''La Libertad,'' a song by the famous salsa singer Frankie Ruiz, blasted from a huge radio on his picnic table. ''Here, you have all types of people: black, Indian, Chinese. That's important.''</p>
