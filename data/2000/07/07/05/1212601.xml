        <p>Consumers May See Higher Heating Bills This Winter  After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to heat American homes.</p>
        <p>With demand for fuel and electricity soaring, natural gas prices have nearly doubled in the last year, to their highest levels in more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen 10 percent just in the last month. This winter, many homeowners could discover that it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their homes than it did last year.

        <p>Consumers May See Higher Heating Bills This Winter  After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to heat American homes.</p>
        <p>With demand for fuel and electricity soaring, natural gas prices have nearly doubled in the last year, to their highest levels in more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen 10 percent just in the last month. This winter, many homeowners could discover that it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their homes than it did last year.

        <p>Of Parachutes and Software  Did you hear the one about the optimistic sky diver? No, this is no joke. Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems, a maker of e-business application software, compares sky diving to taking business risks. He also likens house painting to the software business. And he says that as a result of his Midwestern sensibilities and lessons about hard work and debt, he prefers real business attire for business dealings and hopes his employees never boast about all the Ferraris parked in their lot. The Boss. [C6.]</p>
        <p>European Companies Eye U.S. First  The conventional wisdom has been that European companies, newly emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at home, would use Wall-Street-style tactics in cross-border deals unifying the Continent. But not following the script, European companies have increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the United States first. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Crime News Site to File Chapter 11  APB Online, operator of a criminal justice news Web site that recently foundered, plans to file for protection for creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Last month, ABP Online laid off the staff and scrambled to find private investors to inject new capital into the debt-ridden company. The bankruptcy filing, which the executives of APBnews.com said they would announce as early as today, is designed to provide a little more breathing space for the site. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Record Delays in June for Airlines  June appears to have been the worst month in domestic airline history for delayed flights, preliminary statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration indicate. In general, bad weather accounts for about 70 percent of flight delays, which are the bane of business travel. The big question now is whether the trend will continue as record numbers of passengers crowd onto planes. Joe Sharkey: Business Travel. [C2.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Markets Reopen  The stock market and other financial markets in the United States reopen today after being closed yesterday in observance of the Fourth of July.</p>
