        <p>OH, it was grand all right, grand as could be, the crisp procession of tall ships along the waters of New York. You'd have had to be drained of every drop of romance to be unimpressed by the spectacle and the grace that it shed on us all.</p>
        <p>But it was hard not to feel that several important, if undistinguished, vessels were missing in the hullabaloo of OpSail 2000. They were ordered off the water so they would not get in the way of their fairer, more favored cousins that set sail on this Fourth of July.</p>

        <p>OH, it was grand all right, grand as could be, the crisp procession of tall ships along the waters of New York. You'd have had to be drained of every drop of romance to be unimpressed by the spectacle and the grace that it shed on us all.</p>
        <p>But it was hard not to feel that several important, if undistinguished, vessels were missing in the hullabaloo of OpSail 2000. They were ordered off the water so they would not get in the way of their fairer, more favored cousins that set sail on this Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>We are talking about the ferryboats that carry thousands of people a day from Battery Park to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Since they were unable to leave their moorings, it meant that the inspiring statue and the historic immigration center were closed to the public for the day.</p>
        <p>No big deal, you say? What's one day?</p>
        <p>Not much perhaps. But it did seem strange that on the day Americans celebrated their emergence as a people, the people could not reach enduring symbols of the country's claim to be a beacon for -- how did Emma Lazarus put it? -- those ''huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''</p>
        <p>Close Liberty and Ellis Islands on Independence Day? Fine. While you are at it, why not shut the doors of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Easter Sunday because all those worshipers interfere with the thousands flocking to Fifth Avenue for the fashion show known as the Easter Parade?</p>
        <p>Larry Drees, of Boulder, Colo., was one of many visitors to Battery Park on the eve of the holiday who could not believe that the Statue of Liberty, of all places, would be off limits on the Fourth of July, of all days.</p>
        <p>''It's completely ridiculous,'' he said as he stood Monday afternoon outside Castle Clinton, the old fort that now serves as a ticket booth for the ferries.</p>
        <p>Sure, there might be legitimate security concerns, Mr. Drees said. But he added, ''What's the point of this country if you're going to let your fears over security shut it down?''</p>
        <p>In a sense, the twin islands of liberty and immigration were hostage yesterday to the classically American -- and very New York -- need for chest-thumping over superlatives.</p>
        <p>A parade of graceful ships that pleased the eye and exercised the imagination was of itself insufficient. It had to be beaten into everyone, mercilessly, that this was the biggest, the best, the boldest, the most whatever of all time.</p>
        <p>The advance billing, repeatedly echoed by television announcers, was that it would be ''the greatest event in maritime history.'' Didn't anyone off camera ever whisper ''D-Day'' in these people's ears? Or at least show them a video of ''Saving Private Ryan''?</p>
        <p>But then television merely fell in step with the times. New York, in general, seems to be hooked on always having to top itself.</p>
        <p>IT was not enough for people to enjoy themselves last New Year's Eve. For New Yorkers to have a good time, the celebrations had to be the largest, the liveliest, the most bubbly and eye-popping ever. The same principle governed OpSail yesterday morning and the holiday fireworks display last night, an appreciated annual gift from Macy's that is also an obvious promotional device. (Call it OpSale.)</p>
        <p>The fireworks were not merely splendiferous. What counted for many New Yorkers was that they were the most outsized: 60,000 shells weighing 150 tons and bursting at a rate of 2,000 per minute, or if you preferred, 34 per second.</p>
        <p>On and on, for weeks, the numbers poured out of an ever-churning hype machine. Four million people would view the ships. There would be 70,000 craft in the water. About 28,000 police officers would be on duty. That some of those numbers were gross exaggerations made no nevermind. What mattered for many people were the superlatives themselves. They were the ultimate affirmation of our civic worth, not the waterborne displays of grace and majesty.</p>
        <p>Some people did not buy it.</p>
        <p>They knew that numbers were fleeting and that the Statue of Liberty was a lot more than a backdrop for a fireworks display, especially on this holiday.</p>
        <p>They were people like Jo Ann and Sam Mannino, visitors from Detroit, who went to the statue with their three small children on the Third of July.</p>
        <p>''If we don't get our kids to understand things like the Statue of Liberty, and the pain that people went through -- '' Mr. Mannino said. He did not finish the thought, picking up a different one instead.</p>
        <p>''That's the first symbol of America,'' he said as his wife nodded.</p>
        <p>''It's called a reality check,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her husband agreed, and pointed to the children. ''They've got to learn about it,'' he said.</p>
