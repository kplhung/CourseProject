        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended his father as the ''finest man'' he has ever known, as reporters questioned him at a news conference yesterday about a report that the elder Giuliani had spent time in prison after being convicted of armed robbery decades ago.</p>
        <p>The mayor did not directly answer the questions, which were prompted by a forthcoming book that claims the mayor's father, Harold Giuliani, served a year and a half in state prison for robbing a milk deliveryman in 1934.</p>
        <p>According to the book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph W. Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett, Harold Giuliani pulled a gun on the milkman in a building on East 96th Street and, with an accomplice, robbed him of $128.82.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett is a reporter for The Village Voice. The book, which is to be published next week, was excerpted on the Voice's Web site on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said he would not discuss the excerpts because ''it has no relevance to me and what I do as mayor of New York City, or my life.''</p>
        <p>The report comes during a difficult year for the mayor. He announced that he was suffering from prostate cancer, decided to withdraw from a United States Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, and announced plans to separate from his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>The mayor, a former federal prosecutor, has a reputation for being tough on crime, and New York has seen every major category of crime drop substantially under his administration. The revelations that Harold Giuliani may have served time at Sing Sing Correctional Facility a decade before his son was born cast new attention on the mayor's personal life, something he rarely discussed before this year.</p>
        <p>Harold Giuliani, who owned a bar and grill in Brooklyn, was sentenced to two to five years at Sing Sing and served a year and a half, according to the book. He died of prostate cancer in 1981 at age 73.</p>
        <p>''My father died 19 years ago, and the details of his life died with him, as far as I'm concerned,'' the mayor said yesterday.</p>
        <p>When asked whether his father had ever told him of his past, the mayor responded, ''I'm not going to discuss my discussions with my father.''</p>
        <p>The mayor would say only that his father ''taught me enormously important lessons, including the lesson of being honest, which I've practiced all my life.'' He added, ''His influence on me was to drill into my skull from the time I was a little boy that I had to be very honest, that you had to be honest to yourself first and honest with others second.''</p>
        <p>''I appreciated the lessons he taught me,'' the mayor said. ''He was a complete man.''</p>
