      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>About a year ago Douglas Dunn had a bright idea. He wrote to all 1,500 people on his mailing list, asking them for choreographic suggestions. He received 30 responses. These provided him with material for ''The Common Good,'' which Douglas Dunn and Dancers presented on Sunday night at St. Mark's Church as part of the church's Danspace Project.</p>
        <p>The result was an hourlong assemblage of scraps of movement to a pleasantly eclectic taped collage of music, ranging from Bach and Scarlatti to Smokey Robinson and the Righteous Brothers. The choreography was equally eclectic and, at its weakest, appeared to be only a collection of brisk little hops and skips that did nothing more than make the cast look perpetually busy.</p>

        <p>The result was an hourlong assemblage of scraps of movement to a pleasantly eclectic taped collage of music, ranging from Bach and Scarlatti to Smokey Robinson and the Righteous Brothers. The choreography was equally eclectic and, at its weakest, appeared to be only a collection of brisk little hops and skips that did nothing more than make the cast look perpetually busy.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Dunn's opening solo had attractive and unhurried swinging movements, and some episodes were interesting for their dramatic implications. At one point Kate Cross, Monica Olsson, Beth Simons and Waka Watanabe rushed at Mr. Dunn and adorned him with fronds. He looked nervous as a result.</p>
        <p>Grazia Della-Terza, who had been curled up on a rug, apparently sleeping, rose from her nap clad in silken scarfs and danced a solo filled with curving, almost voluptuous movements.</p>
        <p>Later, dancers shifted cardboard cutouts of trees, and Ms. Della-Terza and Mr. Dunn sat on chairs, looking morose as they listened to a recorded speech about unhappy love by the novelist Jean Rhys. The dancers also appeared to die and rise again, rejoicing.</p>
        <p>Moment by moment, many of these sequences were fascinating. But they had little cumulative power. This dance, based on suggestions, resembled a patchwork quilt, and some of the choreographic patches were brighter than others.</p>
