        <p>A FEW weeks ago, I sat at the bar at Village and ordered an ice cream sundae.

        <p>A FEW weeks ago, I sat at the bar at Village and ordered an ice cream sundae. Minutes later, the bartender came barreling toward me with what looked to be the classic, from the whipped cream on top down to the tall, thick glass and long thin spoon. I could have been on a stool at a soda fountain.</p>
        <p>But the similarities stopped there. My first taste, a languorous spoonful of whipped cream, was not too sweet. The ice cream beneath was a true, eggy vanilla and was draped with a bitter chocolate sauce. These were mingling with coarse bits of nut brownie and a cherry sauce sharpened with kirsch and balsamic vinegar.</p>
        <p>The ice cream sundae had shed its youthful, frivolous shell. This was a balanced, thoughtfully constructed dessert, something that nourished the intellect and the palate, not just the pangs of the stomach. It was, in essence, as plain and dutiful in its purpose as a sundae should be, and yet it intimated just how many possibilities there are with such a dessert.</p>
        <p>It made me wonder what it could be in the hands of a great pastry chef. Would he reform its parts and turn it inside out? Would he add new components? Or would he snicker, and act as if I had asked him to take a stab at toast?</p>
        <p>I got on the phone, called seven of New York's top chefs and pastry chefs and asked them to create their own interpretations of the dessert, to ruminate on every detail, from the density of the ice cream to the design of the serving dish.</p>
        <p>After what seemed like many long pauses, all but one -- who dismissed it as ''a study in sugar'' -- agreed, turning out sundaes that were astonishing both in their ability to stretch the definition of the dessert and their devotion to the classic design.</p>
        <p>For some chefs, like Luis Bollo at Meigas, who recently moved to New York from Spain, this meant working from what he had read, and impressions he had formed about sundaes, rather than from experience eating them. With Roni Ross, the pastry chef at Nobu, it was a matter of using ingredients familiar from her Asian fusion repertory and sculpturing them into a sundae.  And then there was Florian Bellanger, the pastry chef at Le Bernardin, a recent immigrant from France, who had to climb from an abyss: his single sundae experience was at McDonald's.</p>
        <p>Sundaes, as it turns out, are not strictly American, and so some chefs drew on desserts from other countries to help improve the design.</p>
        <p>Anna Klinger, the chef at Al Di La in Brooklyn, had already been working hard on a sundae recipe for her menu when I called. She and her husband, Emiliano Coppa, had been trying to recreate a dessert, called gianduiotto, served at a couple of the old cafes in Venice. Gianduiotto has all the necessary components of a sundae: the ice cream, the crunch, the whipped cream, the wonderfully sloppy ending.</p>
        <p>She makes a pleasantly gooey ice cream with gianduja and bitter chocolates, layers it in a baking pan with chopped toasted hazelnuts, freezes it and cuts it into thick bars. Then, she pipes whipped cream into a juice glass and presses the bar into the glass. As she does this, the cream squeezes around it, filling up all the spaces in the glass and billowing out the top like a cloud.</p>
        <p>The ice cream bar starts out hard and softens, but it's creamy like a toffee and never really falls apart. The nuts appear at random but not in every bite. And the whipped cream, barely sweetened, inserts tactile relief, making each taste feel like a foamy milkshake in the top of your mouth.</p>
        <p>The textures and temperatures in the dessert are as crucial as the actual flavors. ''The crunch is very important with the one that we do,'' Ms. Klinger said. ''The ice cream feels very cold, and somehow the cream doesn't feel very cold and there's something nice about that.''</p>
        <p>Zarela Martinez, the owner of Zarela, a Mexican restaurant, aimed to fix the sundae with heavy Mexican influences and an emphasis on peanuts, a crop brought to Mexico by African sugar cane workers. Rather than a peanut ice cream, she made a peanut ice milk. ''There are so many fabulous fruits and ices in Mexico,'' she said, ''and I don't like cream.''</p>
        <p>Her sundae, however, does not suffer from a lack of richness. For a sauce, she turned to a drink called torito, from Veracruz. It's a loose, boozy liquid of condensed milk, evaporated milk, peanut butter and sugar-cane liquor. The scoops of the peanut ice swam in it, and tiny ice crystals formed around it as in an ice cream soda. On top she sprinkled pieces of peanut brittle. The repetition of flavor gave it structure; the variation of texture gave it life.</p>
        <p>Where many sundaes go wrong is in the blending of flavors. Most sundaes are served in a tall glass or deep bowl. The sauces are warm and the ice cream is slippery, so it is only a few bites before everything starts melding into a thick soup. Each component must be able to mix with the population of other flavors.</p>
        <p>The sundae that Mr. Bollo at Meigas assembled was a surprising juxtaposition of typical Spanish flavors. He served it in a martini glass with a shot of flame orange kumquat sauce at the bottom, covered by a mound of coffee-colored crema catalana ice cream, two thin slivers of almond cake and a jagged shard of caramelized sugar that glistened like a pane of stained glass. It was beautiful to look at, but the chances of the components mixing together successfully seemed slim.</p>
        <p>The ice cream was a rich, lazy cream, scented with nutmeg. The kumquat sauce was aggressively sharp and bitter. The sugar shard had a burned flavor and crackled like dry leaves. When they mixed together, though, the jarring contrasts came together like a Creamsicle. A serious, grown-up Creamsicle.</p>
        <p>In Spain, Mr. Bollo said, he would have used Seville oranges, but kumquats are a fine substitute. The ice cream, he said, needs that kind of acidity to balance its richness.</p>
        <p>Even more startling was what Ms. Ross at Nobu came up with. Her sundae, served in a tall parfait glass, looked like a child's dream Bomb Pop with layers of colors -- pale green, pink, white, caramel. It was leveled cleanly at the top and crowned with a yamamomo berry, a Japanese mountain berry, flecked with gold leaf. She made clean layers by freezing it after each layer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ross chose flavors that she uses regularly and ordered them so that the colors would contrast nicely. That order was also the most palatable.</p>
        <p>First, there was a layer of whipped cream and tiny bits of pistachio. It tasted uncannily like Lucky Charms. Then things got serious. A minerally green tea ice cream followed, then a ginger caramel sauce. A pink layer in the middle turned out to be a red bean ice cream, sort of the starch of the dish. More caramel sauce lingered beneath.</p>
        <p>Just when things began to seem heavy, the next layer, a lemony yuzu ice cream, shook it all up. And then there was the kicker: a base of what looked like pesto. It was shiso leaf, chopped and marinated in a simple syrup. After it all, you eat the yamamomo berry, which looks and tastes like a cross between a cherry and raspberry.</p>
        <p>Not only was it a treasure trove of surprises, but each spoonful was like a geological sample. Only when you got way down into it did it get mixed up and mushy.</p>
        <p>A good sundae should transfix you, as you dig and work and uncover all of its parts. Eating Nobu's sundae was just that way. It was impossible to carry on a conversation, impossible to take in surroundings, impossible to think about anything else but the glass and getting to the bottom.</p>
        <p>Only Dan Barber and Alex Urena, the chefs at Blue Hill, chose to serve their sundae unconstructed and in the unpredictable hands of the diner. They turned it into an interactive playground of toppings, each with a twist.</p>
        <p>''It appeals to me to have the overabundance and then feel sort of sick and full,'' Mr. Barber said. ''I wonder if that's not part of the pleasure, getting to mix and match what you like and then feeling kind of full.''</p>
        <p>With theirs, it's inevitable. You are served a large deep bowl, with quenelles of chocolate sorbet, vanilla ice cream and apricot-pit ice cream that lie like rocks in a well. A little banana foam is sprayed on top in lieu of whipped cream.</p>
        <p>Then it is up to you to fill that well, choosing from a long rectangular tray of condiments. There were tiny homemade marshmallows, coated in coconut and as soft as feather pillows; a hot, bitter chocolate sauce; a warm milk jam; a minty, winey cherry sauce; crackly coin-shaped pralines; and Scharffen Berger chocolate nibs for bitterness and crunch.</p>
        <p>Self control is pushed to its most fragile limits, but it's a frantic, delicious circus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellanger, whose sundae journey began with a dud, ended up sticking very close to the classic, sanding down the rough edges and refining it with detail work.</p>
        <p>He began with a single flavor in mind. Then, he said, ''I decide other flavors, but they are there to support and enhance the main flavor.'' And he limited those supporting flavors to five. ''After that,'' he said, ''it gets confusing.''</p>
        <p>His focus was the very un-French flavor of peanuts. He made a chunky salted-peanut ice cream that was heavier on the milk than cream, so that it wouldn't be too heavy and wouldn't get too hard. Over small golf-ball size scoops in a martini glass, he drizzled thin ribbons of a caramel sauce seasoned with fleur de sel from Brittany.</p>
        <p>He dropped in whole salted peanuts and pieces of chocolate-covered wafers, bought in the grocery store (better, Mr. Bellanger said, than anything he could make because they are crisp and as light as air). The chocolate coating adds a dimension of flavor but also protects the wafers from becoming soggy. ''By the time you finish your ice cream,'' Mr. Bellanger said, ''you should get different sensations of temperature, of consistency, of crunch.'' With his sundae, you do. Every bite was crunch, crunch, crunch.</p>
        <p>On top, there was a sprawling dollop of whipped cream, left unsweetened to counter the sweet in the ice cream and the salt in the caramel sauce. ''To add sugar in the whipped cream,'' he said, ''makes the sensation that it is more heavy.'' Such deceptions are permissible in a sundae.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bellanger conceded that the McDonald's sundae has a ''perfect texture,'' its influences were not evident.</p>
        <p>As he assembled his creation, working intensely but excitedly, Mr. Bellanger suffered teasing from others in Le Bernardin's kitchen. If he was making ice cream sundaes, one cook taunted, were banana splits next?</p>
        <p>Let's hope so.</p>
        <p>CARAMEL PEANUT SUNDAE  Adapted from Florian Bellanger  Time: about 1 hour, plus chilling and freezing time</p>
        <p>For the salted butter caramel sauce:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sugar  2 tablespoons butter</p>
        <p>1/4 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1/4 cup milk</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel or coarse sea salt  2 tablespoons corn syrup  For the vanilla-peanut ice cream:  1 1/2 cups milk  1 Tahitian vanilla bean, split and pulp scraped  1 tablespoon corn syrup  4 large egg yolks</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped salted peanuts  For assembly:  3 square chocolate-coated wafers, cut into quarters  1 cup coarsely chopped salted peanuts  1 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks.</p>
        <p>1. To prepare caramel sauce: In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir  1/2 cup sugar until melted. Reduce heat to low, and slowly add butter,  1/4 cup heavy cream and  1/4 cup milk; be careful to avoid spattering. Remove from heat, and add salt and 2 tablespoons corn syrup. Mix until smooth. Cool, cover and refrigerate until chilled, 2 hours or overnight.</p>
        <p>2. To prepare ice cream: In a medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk, vanilla bean and pulp, and 1 tablespoon corn syrup. Place over medium heat until steaming; meanwhile, in a medium bowl whisk egg yolks and  1/3 cup sugar until light in color and fluffy. Whisk about  1/3 of the hot milk mixture into eggs, then whisk egg mixture back into pan. Continue to heat mixture until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.  Strain into a bowl set over ice water, and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer mixture to an ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions. When ice cream has finished churning, stir in  1/2 cup peanuts. Transfer to a plastic container, and freeze.</p>
        <p>4. For assembly: Pour a little caramel sauce into each of 4 tall glasses. Lay a wafer in each glass, top with a scoop of ice cream, another wafer, another scoop of ice cream, and another wafer. Add more caramel sauce, and sprinkle on some chopped peanuts. Add whipped cream, top with more caramel sauce and peanuts, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>PEANUT SUNDAE WITH PEANUT SAUCE AND PEANUT BRITTLE  Adapted from Zarela Martinez  Time: 3 hours, plus freezing time</p>
        <p>For the peanut ice:</p>
        <p>1/3 cup sugar  3 cups skim milk</p>
        <p>3/4 cup creamy peanut butter  For the peanut and sesame seed candies:  1 cup raw peanuts  1 cup sesame seeds  4 piloncillo cones (Mexican brown sugar), about 2 pounds total (see note)  For the peanut sauce:  2 12-ounce cans evaporated milk  1 14-ounce can condensed milk  1 cup sugar-cane liquor (see note)</p>
        <p>1/2 cup creamy peanut butter</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract.</p>
        <p>1. To make peanut ice, in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar with  1/3 cup water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Simmer until sugar dissolves.</p>
        <p>2. In a blender or food processor, combine  syrup, skim milk and peanut butter, and process until smooth. Transfer mixture to an ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.</p>
        <p>3. To make candies, in a heavy skillet over medium heat, toast peanuts, turning them so they do not burn, for about 5 minutes. Immediately transfer to food processor, or spread them out on a large baking sheet. If using a food processor, pulse gently until  nuts are just broken up, about 1 minute. Otherwise, use a rolling pin to crush nuts on  baking sheet.</p>
        <p>4. In same skillet over medium heat, toast  sesame seeds, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Add to peanuts in food processor or baking sheet.</p>
        <p>5. In a large heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the piloncillo sugar with 1 quart water. Bring mixture to a boil, stirring frequently until the piloncillo melts. Continue to cook until syrup reaches hard crack stage (285 degrees on a candy thermometer), about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in peanuts and sesame seeds. Pour mixture onto a  baking sheet lined with parchment or waxed paper. Cool. Place candy in a heavy duty plastic bag, and use a rolling pin to crush it into pea-size pieces.</p>
        <p>6. To make peanut sauce, in a blender or food processor, combine all ingredients and process until smooth. Transfer to a tightly covered bottle, and store in refrigerator for up to one month.</p>
        <p>7. To assemble sundaes, pour a little bit of  peanut sauce into a tall glass. Place two scoops of peanut ice on top. Sprinkle with a little crushed candy and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Sugar-cane liquor from Brazil, called cachaca, is available at liquor stores. Piloncillo sugar is available in Mexican specialty shops like Kitchen Market, 218 Eighth Avenue (21st Street); (212) 243-4433.</p>
