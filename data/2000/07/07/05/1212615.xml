        <p>It is not easy to hide a 33-story building on 57th Street.</p>
        <p>But the Lefrak Organization managed the trick in 1972 with the Squibb Building, at 40 West 57th Street, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, which has neither an ample plaza nor an imposing lobby; just a dull, 200-foot-long recessed arcade at the base of a boxy, brown tower with about as much aesthetic pizazz as a U.P.S. truck.</p>
        <p>Such understatement apparently suited Squibb, a pharmaceutical company that merged in 1989 with Bristol-Myers. But it no longer suits the Lefrak Organization, which has to fill half the building when Squibb's 30-year lease expires in 2002.</p>
        <p>Scott Gottlieb, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, the leasing agent for 40 West 57th Street, said the building ''requires a significant investment'' to be competitive with the better properties nearby.</p>
        <p>Lefrak, which built the tower and still owns it, has hired the architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates to undertake a $30 million renovation, starting with the arcade and lobby. The project may work its way up the facade to the very top of the building by the time it is completed in late 2002. ''The idea is to give the building more presence on the street and a more significant entrance, and to make it commensurate with other Class A buildings in the neighborhood,'' said Richard S. LeFrak, president of the Lefrak Organization.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers Squibb, with world headquarters at 345 Park Avenue, has vacated most of the top 16 floors it once occupied at 40 West 57th and is subleasing the space, he said.</p>
        <p>Other tenants include the Marlborough Gallery, which represents Fernando Botero, Red Grooms and Larry Rivers; Infinity Broadcasting, a radio network with a subsidiary that is the nation's largest outdoor advertising concern; International Creative Management, a talent and literary agency; the Nautica Enterprises fashion company and Yves Saint Laurent of America.</p>
        <p>Despite all this creative energy under the roof, the building has a ''sense of anonymity,'' said Laurie Butler of Kohn Pedersen Fox, who is working on the renovation with Paul Katz, A. Eugene Kohn and Marianne Kwok. The solution, Mr. Kohn said, is to create ''lightness, brightness and cheerfulness'' by replacing the stubby brown columns along the arcade with stainless-steel cylinders; substituting light gray granite paving for the dark brown brick; and installing a screen of translucent and clear glass panels, illuminated from behind, along the parapet of the 57th Street arcade.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the face lift may include the installation of aluminum strips over the brown mullions between windows and the application of silvery or champagne-hued aluminum panels over the blank brick walls (brown, of course) on the east and west facades.</p>
        <p>Samuel J. LeFrak, the chairman of the Lefrak Organization, said the windowless side walls responded to a concern on the part of Squibb executives -- in the midst of the political tumult of the late 1960's and early 70's -- that they might be targeted by terrorists. ''They were afraid there'd be sharpshooters shooting in on them,'' Mr. LeFrak recalled.</p>
        <p>With that danger evidently past, the Lefrak Organization plans to break through the blank walls in some of the upper floors to create more windows.</p>
        <p>Lefrak originally had a more ambitious reconstruction in mind: pushing the retail space in the 57th Street arcade all the way out to the building line, a distance of about 15 feet.</p>
        <p>But the arcade, though it appears to be an open-air strip mall, is in fact public space. It was originally provided as an amenity in exchange for a zoning bonus. Every square foot of the arcade created an extra 10 square feet of rentable office space for the Lefrak Organization.</p>
        <p>''What you giveth, it's hard to taketh away,'' Richard LeFrak said, even though city planners now generally favor buildings that extend to their lot lines, thereby maintaining a uniform ''street wall.''</p>
        <p>The lobby, now reached through a north-south covered walkway that bisects the block, will be expanded toward 57th Street by sacrificing one store in the arcade. The arcade, the walkway and a plaza on the 56th Street side created a zoning bonus totaling 78,000 square feet of commercial space, which now rents for $65 to $85 a square foot annually.</p>
        <p>Unless a tenant comes along large enough to warrant renaming the building, a ''40W'' logo more than 12 feet high will be sandblasted into the glass wall of the new lobby. As homage to Ivan Chermayeff's giant fire-engine-red ''9'' sculpture at 9 West 57th Street, the W will be in red.</p>
