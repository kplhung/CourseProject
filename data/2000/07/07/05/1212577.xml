        <p>I am about to commit a new millennium offense for which there is no punishment. In fact, I am sure many will hail me as a hero.</p>
        <p>Here's what I'm going to do: The next time I'm in the grocery store and see someone yakking away on a cell phone, oblivious to the fact that her grocery cart is blocking the aisle, I will reach out and press the off button.</p>
        <p>Talk about road rage. I am afflicted with a new syndrome, let's call it ''cell phone rage.'' Try driving behind one of these wireless scofflaws on the highway as he drives 20 miles an hour, too busy talking to obey the speed limit. I would feel justified pulling out a bullhorn and directing: ''Hang up the phone. Hang up the phone now!''</p>
        <p>I am not alone. Signs are beginning to pop up prohibiting cell phones in certain areas. One New Jersey town has even introduced one of the country's first local ordinances banning the use of cell phones while driving.</p>
        <p>Restaurant owners are creating special sections for cell phone users. School districts are cracking down on students talking on phones in the hallways and classrooms.</p>
        <p>Even so, many phone users continue to talk loudly -- and anywhere. People seem to think every place is a good place to talk on the phone: the doctor's office, the theater, even funerals. My cousin told me about one encounter with a man who was sitting under a sign prohibiting cell phone use and took a call anyway. When my cousin pointed to the sign, the man apologized and hung up. But a few minutes later the man's telephone rang again and he took the call, without even moving from the prohibited area.</p>
        <p>Many people who use cell phones are also guilty of broadcasting too much private information. I don't care about the hives on your elbow or your Saturday night plans to dine with Joe and Ethel. Save the gossip about your brother-in-law cheating on your sister with her best friend. I don't need to know. Lower your voice; you are not at home or in a  telephone booth.</p>
        <p>It seems we need more than laws to change this kind of discourteous -- and even dangerous -- behavior. I say it is time for the cell phone police to step forward and devise some cell phone etiquette.</p>
