        <p>After months of supportive speeches, fat donation checks and thousands of hours of volunteer campaign work, the two national teachers' unions formally endorsed Vice President Al Gore for president today in separate votes.</p>
        <p>The endorsements came as no surprise, but could prove significant in a campaign in which both candidates are making education a priority.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore the backing is an important symbol of support from the Democratic Party's traditional base and a significant organizing tool for the coming months. But while the vice president will try to use the endorsements to show that his education agenda reflects the opinions of classroom experts, his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will undoubtedly accuse Mr. Gore of being in the unions' pockets and uninterested in true school reform.</p>
        <p>''He needs more than unions,'' said Mindy Tucker, a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, a Republican. ''He needs the support of parents and school board members and people in local communities that make the decisions that affect our schools.''</p>
        <p>For months, the candidates have been trying to one-up each other with education proposals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants to provide preschool for every 4-year-old, give teachers signing bonuses to work in difficult schools and pump federal money into school construction, among other ideas totaling $115 billion over a decade. Mr. Bush would spend $13 billion and focus attention on holding low-performing schools accountable by imposing financial penalties and heightening scrutiny of test data, particularly among minority students.</p>
        <p>Among the chasms between the candidates are their positions on providing vouchers, financed by taxpayers, for tuition in private schools, an issue that alone might have been enough to decide the union endorsements. Mr. Bush refrains from using the word ''vouchers,'' but would let students at failing schools take $1,500 of government money to a private school. Mr. Gore opposes vouchers, as do the unions.</p>
        <p>At the biennial convention of the American Federation of Teachers here today, Nat LaCour, the union's executive vice president, ticked off issue after issue, like increasing teacher salaries and providing better health care for children. On each one, Mr. LaCour said, Mr. Gore was a friend of the union's one million members, ''not Mr. Bush.''</p>
        <p>Speaker after speaker lavished praise on the vice president, who is scheduled to speak here on Wednesday and at the convention of the 2.5 million-member National Education Association on Thursday in Chicago. Several Texas teachers told their colleagues that Mr. Bush's accomplishments in schools have been exaggerated. Finally, one man recommended no endorsement, saying that the Clinton administration's trade policies had expanded child labor overseas, but the endorsement was overwhelming on a voice vote.</p>
        <p>At the N.E.A. convention in Chicago, Mr. Gore received 89 percent of the votes, cast by secret ballot.</p>
        <p>''In the search for ideas to improve public education, Al Gore knows where to look first,'' said Robert Chase, the president of the N.E.A. ''He looks to teachers.''</p>
