        <p>Wielding the persuasive weapon of money, Western art dealers and collectors appear to have vanquished ethnologists in the battle over so-called primitive art.</p>
        <p>Objects created for religious, ritualistic or tribal reasons, like African fertility statues, pre-Columbian stone figures and Oceanic masks, are now routinely traded -- and admired -- as works of art. Even the Louvre has begun displaying primitive art exclusively on aesthetic merit.</p>
        <p>Yet when it comes to contemporary art from outside the Western world, the lines are far more blurred. This new art is created as art, it often relies on Western techniques -- its creators may even live in New York and Paris -- yet its strength still lies in its identity with a non-Western reality. At the same time, as multiculturalism has become fashionable in the West, artists trained in a Western tradition have found inspiration in the ''magic realism'' of much third world art.</p>
        <p>This at least is the thesis of ''Sharing Exoticisms,'' the name given to the Fifth Lyon Biennial of Contemporary Art, which is being held in the cavernous Halle Tony Garnier through Sept. 24. In a world ''globalized'' by information, consumerism and migration, cultures no longer stay put. ''Exoticism'' has ceased to be a euphemism for folkloric backwardness: it now works both ways. Anthropology, proclaim the biennial's artistic directors, Thierry Prat and Thierry Raspail, has defeated aestheticism.</p>
        <p>The show's poster image illustrates this with a photograph of a blond German dressed as a Native American, part of a series called ''German Indians,'' taken by Andrea Robbins and Max Becher in the German town of Radebeul during its annual Wild West festival. The colorful geometric mural at the entrance to the show, on the other hand, is signed jointly by Esther Mahlangu, a South African wall painter, and the American Sol LeWitt, with no indication as to which parts were done by which artist.</p>
        <p>The biennial's guest curator, Jean-Hubert Martin, who now heads the Kunst Palast Museum in Dusseldorf, has long encouraged this eclectic approach. In 1989, while director of the Pompidou Center's Modern Art Museum, he organized a show called ''The Magicians of the Earth'' that took the unusual approach of treating first and third world artists as equals. Then, in the mid-1990's, while running the Museum of African and Oceanic Art in Paris, he began adding contemporary art to the colonial collection.</p>
        <p>For ''Sharing Exoticisms,'' he formed a committee of five anthropologists who helped him define 22 ethnological categories, all linked to human behavior, into which he eventually slotted works by 120 artists from 30 or so countries. With generic titles like ''To Dress,'' ''To Love,'' ''To Cure,'' ''To Pray'' and ''To Die,'' each section opens with an iconic work, in most cases taken from ''primitive art,'' as a way of demonstrating the continuity of symbols and concerns.</p>
        <p>The work that greets the public in the opening section, ''Exotiser,'' or ''To Make Exotic,'' sets a mischievous tone. An installation placed in what appears to be an open-sided tribal hut includes copies of Western paintings, statues and art objects and is called ''Somewhere in Africa there is a great black man collecting art from Europe and America.'' Its author, though, is not African: it is Nedko Solakov, a Bulgarian artist living in Sofia.</p>
        <p>Apart from Mr. LeWitt, the biennial includes works by other well known artists, among them Gilbert and George, Annette Messager, Antoni  Tapies and Anish Kapoor. Yet this is a show in which individual artists are less important than the voyage through the theme park of exoticisms. Blue curtains dividing the space more or less force visitors to follow a prescribed route.</p>
        <p>The categories allow works from different continents and cultures to be confronted, but they also serve as a guide for interpreting individual pieces. In ''Exotiser,'' for instance, the colonial view of the exotic is spoofed by the Swiss artists Marcel Biefer and Beat Zgraggen, who photograph themselves as white ''native'' warriors, naked except for their armor of old cans and assorted industrial detritus.</p>
        <p>Manuel Ocampo, a Filipino artist working in Berkeley, Cal., paints large primitive-style tableaux that, on closer inspection, are anticolonialist protest works.</p>
        <p>''To Tattoo'' reminds how the West has embraced a form of body decoration that was discovered by Westerners in the Pacific Islands only in the 19th century. Gerald Minkhoff and Mureil Olesen, a Swiss couple, photograph themselves in mises-en-scene using Mr. Minkoff's tattooed body. Greg Semu, a New Zealand artist of Samoan extraction, photographs the complex tattoos of the pe'a male initiation ritual that cover his own body. Farid Belkahia, a Moroccan artist, works more symbolically, tattooing large hands made of lamb's skin placed on canvas.</p>
        <p>The variety of materials used is impressive. The French artist Serge Goudin-Thebia has created human forms with old leaves held together by long wooden pins. Wenda Gu, a Chinese artist living in new York, has brought ''United Nations'' (renamed ''Temple of Exoticism'' here), a large room in which chairs have television screens as seats and the walls are covered in words of many languages written with human hair and held together by glue.</p>
        <p>Another Chinese artist, Liang Shaoij, uses real silkworms in an installation in which human forms appear to have been smothered in silk.</p>
        <p>One striking work in ''To House'' is ''Exotica 2000,'' an installation by the French artists Anne and Patrick Poirier, who have built a vast industrial complex in miniature and entirely in black (binoculars are available to look into what resembles an archaeological find). Even larger is a ''United Nations'' by the Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn, an installation showing destroyed towns and villages in numerous countries where the United Nations is struggling to keep the peace.</p>
        <p>Two artists have found unusual ways of bridging the gap between first and third world cultures. Ghada Amer, an Egyptian artist working in New York, creates large delicate embroideries that seem abstract from afar but in fact show naked women in sensual poses. Pascale Marthine Tayou from Cameroon has traced the final days of an imported car in a short film called ''Old New.'' The car, he pointed out, was considered scrap in Europe, but it began a new life when it arrived in Africa. Now a rusting carcass, the car is on display.</p>
        <p>The exhibition does not have sections called ''To Travel'' or ''To Migrate,'' but in a sense they would have best sustained the premise of ''Sharing Exoticisms.'' So many of the third world artists in the show live or have lived in first world capitals, while many Western artists now have made a point of discovering different cultures.</p>
        <p>Still more striking, while early 20th-century artists like Gauguin, Derain, Vlaminck and Picasso borrowed from ''primitive art'' and made it Western, today third world artists have assumed control over their own cultures. Indeed, not only do they define their own ''exoticism,'' but they have also discovered a good deal of the exotic in the ''advanced'' societies of the United States and Europe.</p>
