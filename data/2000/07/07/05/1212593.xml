        <p>In this struggling blue-collar city, tucked into the leafy Quinnipiac River Valley halfway between Hartford and New Haven, the fight over a 100-foot-high mound of jagged shale boulders and scrub brush has officially turned ugly.</p>
        <p>Last week, the city filed a lawsuit in Superior Court against its Planning Commission for approving a  plan to blast the hill down to street level and fill the void with 36 town houses. The city believes the commission approved the project illegally, contravening its own rules protecting local ridge lines. Outraged City Council members voted unanimously last week to spend $15,000 on  lawyers to get the decision reversed.</p>
        <p>Eagerly awaiting the July 25 court date are, on one side, environmentalists and North End residents who live near the hill, and, on the other side, the politically connected businessman who was given the permit to raze the hill. The environmentalists and residents say the hill is a natural extension of Cathole Mountain, a towering face of rock cliffs looming over Meriden from the northwest, and should be developed with care. But to the businessman, William Corvo, and his partners, the hill is just a hill, privately owned and worth millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>''If you feel this is -- not to exaggerate -- the Rocky Mountains or something of that nature, then you should acquire it,'' said Mr. Corvo, 49. A few years ago, he bought the rights to the hill and its 660,000 cubic yards of shale from two of his  friends, Joseph and Salvatore Carabetta, brothers who have made a fortune in local real estate deals over the years.</p>
        <p>And now, Mr. Corvo said, ''I'm going to make some serious money.''</p>
        <p>Since the commission's vote, on June 1, everyone says things have gone drastically wrong. The hill, and Meriden's Planning Commission, were not supposed to end up in court -- again. In 1994, the Planning Commission denied a company controlled by the Carabettas a permit to level the same hill and build houses. The brothers sued the commission, arguing it had no right to deny them a permit, but a Superior Court judge in New Haven sided with the city.</p>
        <p>''The city is in a fervor over this thing,'' said Dominick Caruso, Meridan's director of planning, who had warned the commission minutes before its vote last month to reject the project. Asked why he opposes razing the hill, already surrounded by homes and an apartment complex owned by the Carabettas, Mr. Caruso shrugged and said, ''That's like asking me, 'Why not take this little mountain out of the Rockies?' ''</p>
        <p>Understanding the recurring tug of war over the hill, which is too small to hike and too gentle to climb, requires a brief overview of Meriden city politics.</p>
        <p>The mayor, Joseph Marinan Jr., is a Democrat who appointed the eight-member Planning Commission (three members are nonvoting alternates), including its chairman, Roger DeZinno. At a specially called meeting last month, Mr. DeZinno, also a Democrat, voted with the commission's two Republicans to approve Mr. Corvo's housing project, which passed, 3 to 2.</p>
        <p>That is when the City Council directed the city manager and Mr. Caruso to file a lawsuit. Mr. Corvo responded by hiring Meriden's former Democratic mayor, William T. Shea, as his lawyer. Many people, including some city officials, say they believe that the Carabettas are behind Mr. Corvo's bid -- he will not discuss who his business partners are -- and that they improperly influenced the Planning Commission vote to approve it.</p>
        <p>The Planning Commission's chairman, Mr. DeZinno, and the Carabettas ''enjoy boating together'' on a powerboat owned by the brothers, said Stephen J. Anderson, a lawyer representing two homeowners suing the city and the commission to stop the project. Mr. Anderson also points out that Lois DeMayo, a Republican planning commissioner who voted to approve razing the hill, owns a telephone-answering service that contracts its services to companies owned by the Carabettas.</p>
        <p>''It has to be some personal financial reason for them to do that,'' Mr. Anderson said of Mr. DeZinno's and Ms. DeMayo's position. ''They want to take millions of dollars worth of rock off this hill.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Corvo accuses Mr. Caruso, the city planner, of being unprofessional and having a ''personal problem'' with developing the hill. He said that after the commission's vote last month to approve his project, Mr. Caruso began slamming doors and pointing threatening fingers at commission members. ''I've got it all on videotape,'' Mr. Corvo said.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeMayo blames the local media and a dogged pack of ''tree huggers'' for keeping the issue in local newspaper headlines for the past month. ''We knew this was going to go to court, whichever way we voted,'' she said, and accused the City Council of playing favorites with local developers.</p>
        <p>''If the proper excavation company applied, the one that the city wants to get the contract, that hill would be down tomorrow,'' she said. ''This is all politics. This thing is a hill. It's not cliffs, it's not climbing, it's not hiking, and besides, it's private property.''</p>
        <p>If the City Council wants to protect the property, she asked, why doesn't it vote to buy it?</p>
        <p>The city may get its chance on  Wednesday, when Mr. Corvo is scheduled to meet with Mayor Marinan to try resolving their differences. ''If they feel that it's absolutely critical,'' Mr. Corvo said of the hill, ''then they are going to be given the option of buying it.'' The price: somewhere in the single-digit millions, he said.</p>
        <p>If that does not work out, he said, he is also considering filing individual lawsuits against all 12 Council members for voting to sue the Planning Commission and his development company. ''Everybody,'' he said, ''has got to be personally responsible for their actions.''</p>
