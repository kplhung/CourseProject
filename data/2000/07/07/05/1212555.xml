      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SOME restaurants arrive with expectations. Village is one of them. The expectations swirl around Stephen Lyle, Village's owner and chef, who made his mark at Quatorze and the Odeon, restaurants that pulled off the difficult feat of serving top-quality food in a hip environment. Quatorze, which opened in 1984 and closed a decade later, was the bistro that showed how a bistro should be done, years ahead of the current bistro boom. The Odeon, like Dick Clark, is perpetually ageless and definitively downtown. I never had a bad meal at either place and therefore stepped into Village with soaring hopes.</p>
        <p>It's a good-looking place. The plain red canvas awning out front strikes the right note. Inside, Village is cool and soothing, with dark wood floors, maroon leather upholstery, beveled mirrors and hanging lights that look like grooved melons. A long bar in solid mahogany dominates the front room, which is lined with cozy booths. The main dining room, with tables and banquettes, gets a sense of air and light from an enormous domed skylight.</p>

        <p>SOME restaurants arrive with expectations. Village is one of them. The expectations swirl around Stephen Lyle, Village's owner and chef, who made his mark at Quatorze and the Odeon, restaurants that pulled off the difficult feat of serving top-quality food in a hip environment. Quatorze, which opened in 1984 and closed a decade later, was the bistro that showed how a bistro should be done, years ahead of the current bistro boom. The Odeon, like Dick Clark, is perpetually ageless and definitively downtown. I never had a bad meal at either place and therefore stepped into Village with soaring hopes.</p>
        <p>It's a good-looking place. The plain red canvas awning out front strikes the right note. Inside, Village is cool and soothing, with dark wood floors, maroon leather upholstery, beveled mirrors and hanging lights that look like grooved melons. A long bar in solid mahogany dominates the front room, which is lined with cozy booths. The main dining room, with tables and banquettes, gets a sense of air and light from an enormous domed skylight.</p>
        <p>Village is simple and sleek. The red and cream menus hark back to Quatorze, with food listed on the front and wine on the back.</p>
        <p>The packaging is terrific. The food is good, not great. Village, as the name suggests, has written a fairly undemanding job description for itself. It wants to be a congenial neighborhood place with good food at reasonable prices. It is all of that. But every once in a while, pure inspiration flickers and you get a glimpse of the superbistro that Village might have been, or might yet become.</p>
        <p>It shows in the oyster pan roast, thick and smoky with chipotle peppers and creme fraiche. Crisp corn-bread croutons and fresh corn kernels add a sweet crunchiness to the dish. You catch another glimmer in the smoked crepinettes, fat patties of rustic sausage encased in caul fat and nicely complemented with a cool celery-root remoulade.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Lyle sticks to bistro and cafe classics, like steak with bearnaise sauce, herring with cucumber and potato salad, or guacamole, which he executes in straightforward fashion. Grilled leeks with mustard sauce have a hefty, muscular quality and a nice char. Both steak au poivre and steak with bearnaise sauce are correct, as the French say, and chipotle peppers make a welcome return appearance in a chipotle and beet vinaigrette served over plus-size grilled shrimp.</p>
        <p>Linguine with a deeply flavored roasted tomato sauce can be ordered in a deluxe version, with olives, shrimp and bacon. Deluxe is the way to go, even if it is oily. Generous slices of slab bacon and earthy moroccan olives make natural partners for the tomato, and the shrimp, firm and flavorful, surprisingly manage to hold their own.</p>
        <p>Scallops with a jalapeno vinaigrette, a recent special, delivered a fresh zing, and minced poblano peppers make for a small, clever surprise in steak tartare.</p>
        <p>A salad of chicory and frisee with lardons, the sort of thing that should be a slam-dunk, came out overdressed and very vinegary, however. The vinegar problem was acute in roast leg of lamb with a strange, brownish puree of artichokes and fava beans, which seemed like a failed experiment. Leek and asparagus soup makes a feeble impression, and marinated Icelandic herring had an unpleasantly mushy texture.</p>
        <p>Desserts are a 50-50 proposition. Old-fashioned floating island, an object of fascination at bistros all over town, can be a bland bore. At Village, it is. Chocolate layer marquise is a dense, sticky candy bar. But creme caramel, light and satiny, comes nicely seared on top, with just the right burnt flavor, and fruit tarts (apricot-peach on my most recent visit) have an admirably flaky, buttery crust. The star attraction is an ice cream sundae stuffed with miniature brownies and cherries and buried under a thick chocolate sauce.</p>
        <p>Village is a square deal. It sells reasonably priced wines by the glass and carafe. It has a $25 fixed price menu, consisting of an appetizer, a main course a glass of wine or beer and coffee (no dessert). It offers a cafe menu, with every dish at less than $10, except a terrine of foie gras, at $16. And the wine list has only one bottle priced at more than $65, a 1997 Chateauneuf-du-Pape from Chateau de Beaucastel. What's not to like?</p>
        <p>And yet. From anyone else, Village would be a model neighborhood restaurant. From Mr. Lyle, it counts as a mild disappointment. Call it the curse of Quatorze, whose three-liver pate, steaming choucroute, and plate-size apple tart have taken up permanent residence in my memory. I ate well at Village. I left satisfied and happy. But memory kept pulling me back to another time and place, and the present, fairly or unfairly, seemed a little pale by comparison.</p>
