        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Many people seem to believe that whites don't think about prejudice and think it doesn't exist anymore (''How Race Is Lived in America''). This is not true. I think about race issues all the time. Because of my skin color, I share a weight of guilt and shame. I recognize the bias in the society, and I recognize a habitual bias in myself. Every time I see a person darker than I am, I work on this. I force myself to see and understand my biases and then to eliminate them.</p>

        <p>I am one of those white people who, when slighted by a person of color, take it quietly, as a penance. I am one of those who long for the time, which I almost certainly will not see, when we don't think constantly about race, when we're all just human beings.</p>
