        <p>Beginning and average teacher salaries rose more than 3 percent last year, but they still fell short of earnings by other college-educated workers and, adjusted for inflation, remain below teacher salaries from 1972, according to a survey released today by the American Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>The average annual paycheck for first-year teachers in 1998-99 was $26,639, while teachers with an average of 16.2 years on the job earned $40,574, the survey showed. New Jersey, Connecticut and New York led the nation for average teacher pay, around $50,000, while Mississippi and the Dakotas had the lowest average salaries, below $30,000. Among cities with more than 100,000 residents, Yonkers had the highest starting salary for teachers at $37,045.</p>
        <p>''It's clearly, I think, a national emergency,'' Sandra Feldman, head of the teachers federation, said at the union's biennial convention. ''We have to ask ourselves, What are our priorities here as a nation?''</p>
        <p>Although the union has been conducting the salary survey for a half century, this year's release comes amid an intense national debate over how teachers should be compensated. Facing a national shortage of some 2.5 million teachers over the next decade, school administrators and state legislators have been searching for creative ways to recruit and retain high-quality people.</p>
        <p>Alabama recently enacted a law that will bring its salaries up to the national average by 2007 (provided that tax revenues remain flush). The governors of California and New York are essentially engaged in a bidding war, offering tuition reimbursements, home loans and incentives for advanced certification. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has suggested strong involvement by the federal government, with $5,000 or $10,000 signing bonuses for teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, six states and about a dozen local districts are experimenting with various types of merit-pay plans for teachers. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley has suggested making teaching a year-round profession -- automatically increasing the pay by about 20 percent for the added time at work.</p>
        <p>''I think we're seeing state legislators in a growing number of states, and governors in a growing number of states, being willing to do something about it,'' said Robert Chase, president of the National Education Association, the other major teachers union, which expects a contentious debate over pay-for-performance at its convention this week in Chicago. ''We're seeing the kind of movement we want to see. Hopefully it will expand.''</p>
        <p>Over the past year, Connecticut and the District of Columbia each raised starting salaries for teachers more than 10 percent, the American Federation of Teachers survey showed, while Alabama's first-year pay rose 9.2 percent, Iowa's 8.2 percent, and Minnesota and North Carolina both more than 7 percent. Overall average salaries also shot up 11.3 percent in North Carolina, 9.1 percent in Alabama, and 7.9 percent in the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>''It's just not high enough,'' Ms. Feldman said. ''If it were, we would be able to fill all the teaching vacancies.''</p>
        <p>Alaska was the only state where the average salary dropped, down 1.8 percent to $48,275. The starting salary dropped $10 in North Dakota, to $19,136.</p>
        <p>Still, the starting salary for teachers has not recovered from its inflation-adjusted high of $26,880 in 1972, and remains just 72 percent of what average college graduates expect to earn in their first jobs. Comparing mid-career professionals with similar experience, teachers earn 59 percent as much as engineers and attorneys, 61 percent of the salary of computer analysts, and 82 percent of accountants' pay, according to the teachers federation.</p>
        <p>''I made a lot more money as a pretty bad salesperson than I do as a pretty good teacher,'' said Julie Blaha, 30, a first-year math teacher in Anoka, Minn., who spent the previous five years selling steel.</p>
        <p>Steve Ray, a history teacher at Lincoln High School in Yonkers who is president of the union's local, said he had seen a change in the quality of teachers as the school system has increased salaries some 50 percent over the past decade.</p>
        <p>''Before, if you couldn't get a job elsewhere, you came to Yonkers,'' Mr. Ray said. ''The new teachers we've been hiring over the last six to eight years are top-quality people who look at Yonkers as somewhere they want to spend their careers.''</p>
        <p>While Yonkers previously lost teachers to the surrounding Westchester suburbs and even New York City, ''now you almost have a flip-flop,'' Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>New York City's starting salary of $30,265 -- 18 percent below that of Yonkers -- ranked 23rd among the 100 large cities. ''For New York City experienced teachers,'' he said, ''coming to Yonkers is a promotion.''</p>
