        <p>BRITAIN: CURBING HOOLIGANS  The government proposed emergency laws to give the courts and the police power to restrict suspected soccer hooligans from attending domestic matches and prevent them from traveling to games outside England. With expected Conservative support, the bill should become law before the end of the month. More than 950 English fans were arrested in Belgium during the just-ended Euro 2000 tournament, and organizers threatened to evict England from the competition.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ROYAL FREEZE  Queen Elizabeth II's  taxpayer-supported income will be frozen at  $12 million a year for the next decade thanks to cost-cutting by her family and low inflation, Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament. The payout, called the Civil List, is reviewed every 10 years.</p>

        <p>GREECE: WITNESS PROTECTION  Witnesses to the June 8 terrorist attack against Britain's top military envoy to Athens, Brig. Stephen Saunders, left, will be given special protection, including third-country relocation, according to a government spokesman. Dimitris Reppas said the move ''will pave the way for a string of ad-hoc counterterrorism measures'' that Washington and the European Union have been urging Greece to adopt in its fight against terrorism.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: SANCTIONS REFERENDUM  Austria will hold a referendum in the fall on citizens' opinions of European Union sanctions. The curbs, more symbolic than financial, were imposed to punish Austria for letting the rightist Freedom Party into government. Citizens will be asked whether the government should push for an end to sanctions, which amount to a refusal by European ministers to meet their Austrian counterparts formally.</p>

        <p>LITHUANIA: UNFIT, BUT ON TRIAL  Judges and prosecutors said the trial of a 93-year-old man indicted for aiding the Nazi killing of Jews could proceed despite a ruling that he was mentally unfit. A court said a medical commission had ruled that Kazys Gimzauskas, charged with aiding the NazI genocide during World War II, was unable to stand trial. The court said it would meet on Sept. 11 to rule on how to proceed.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>BRAZIL: PRIEST WARNED ON CONDOMS  The Catholic church in Brasilia threatened to punish a priest for passing out condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, highlighting an internal split among clergy in the world's most populous Catholic country over the Vatican ban. Warning of unspecified punishment, Archbishop Claudio Hummus condemned the priest's ''incompatible'' practice of passing out condoms to the poor in Sao Paulo.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP BACK  President Chandrika Kumaratunga, invoking an emergency decree, has reintroduced censorship on local and foreign news media three days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling that censorship was illegal. The decree will cover whatever the government considers to be against national interests or detrimental to the preservation of public order, officials said. Censorship of war-related news was imposed under emergency regulations in May, but removed from foreign reporters a month later.</p>

        <p>KASHMIR: AUTONOMY REJECTED  The Indian Cabinet rejected a greater autonomy resolution passed by Jammu-Kashmir state lawmakers last week. The resolution would have restored the state's pre-1953 status, under which it had its own president, prime minister and courts. The federal government would have had control of defense, foreign affairs and communications. Similar autonomy demands were made by Assam in 1940, Punjab in 1973 and Tamil Nadu in 1974.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: CABINET SHUFFLE  Yoshiro Mori was reconfirmed as prime minister, a week after his Liberal Democratic Party won a much narrower than predicted victory in legislative elections. In what many analysts saw as a confirmation of his weak position, he immediately picked a new cabinet in which the most powerful economic and foreign policy positions were holdovers from his previous administration.</p>

        <p>IRAQ: MISSILE REPORT RIDICULED  Iraq ridiculed a report in The New York Times that Baghdad had restarted its missile program and flight-tested a short-range ballistic missile, but did not say whether or not it possessed the missile mentioned in the report. The Times, which attributed the report to administration and Pentagon officials, said Iraq had carried out eight tests of a missile, including one last Tuesday, involving a ballistic missile that could carry conventional explosives or chemical and biological weapons. The missile does not violate United Nations restrictions.</p>

        <p>CHAD: HABRE CHARGES DROPPED  A court in Senegal dismissed charges of torture against Hissene Habre, left, the former President of Chad who has lived in exile in Senegal since being ousted in 1990. Senegal's judiciary, which has been going through changes since a new president, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected in March, gave no reason for its decision. In February, Chadian and international rights groups took Mr. Habre to court.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: MILITARY PROTEST  Soldiers angry over pay took to the streets of Abidjan, firing in the air and leaving the commercial capital deserted. The military government led by Gen. Robert Guei, who seized power in a coup last December after an earlier protest by disgruntled soldiers, said the disturbances were started by soldiers who had been demanding $8,700 each for having supported the general.</p>
