        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>BAY SHORE: FATAL FIREWORKS  A 34-year-old Long Island man was decapitated last night when he bent over some lit fireworks to check on them and they exploded, the police said. The accident occurred at 9:30 p.m. in an empty lot along a Sunrise Highway service road. No other information was available.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: REWARD DOUBLED  A resort in Kingston, Jamaica, has doubled the reward for information about a New York travel writer who disappeared while staying at one of its camps. On Monday, Sandals Resorts raised the payment to $50,000 for clues about the writer, Claudia Kirschhoch, 29, who works at Frommer's Travel Guides. Ms. Kirschhoch, who had been staying at a Sandals resort in western Negril, was reported missing on June 2. An Astoria resident, she arrived in Jamaica on May 24 as part of a Sandals-sponsored tour for travel writers, and was last seen on May 27.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: ROBBERY ARREST  Michael Contessa's mistake, the police said, was one of timing: his robbery of a crowded nightclub was undone by a more elaborate endeavor. Early yesterday, Mr. Contessa and two other men robbed Exit, a club on West 56th Street, the police said, only to be captured by officers preparing the block for the Fourth of July celebration. The officers were keeping cars from parking on streets that adjoin the Hudson River when they got a call about the robbery. The three men were caught nearby, the police said.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: PRISONS TO GET TOWERS  The state is building observation towers at 27 medium-security prisons as a means of keeping a better eye on inmates and prison grounds. Eleven of the 31 towers planned are already in place, and work is expected to be completed within the next year. The towers will cost about $2.5 million, according to state prison estimates. All maximum-security prisons in the state already have surveillance towers.</p>

        <p>ROCHESTER: RESEARCH CHIEF  A developer of a vaccine for childhood bacterial meningitis has been selected to lead the Center for Human Genetics and Molecular Pediatric Disease at the University of Rochester. Dr. Richard A. Insel and a team of 12 scientists will study diseases that are caused by damaged genes. In the 1980's, Dr. Insel was one of three University of Rochester researchers who developed the vaccine against Haemophilus influenza Type B, a leading cause of meningitis in young children.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: DOCTOR SUSPENDED  An obstetrician-gynecologist has been temporarily barred from practicing medicine after allegations that she mistreated nine patients, including two who died, state health officials said Monday. The doctor, Monica Applewhite, who has offices in Williamsville and Lockport, faces 23 charges of misconduct. In one case, Dr. Applewhite is accused of performing a tubal ligation, elective surgery that prevents pregnancy, when the patient had an infection. The patient died June 3.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>NEW HAVEN: DEER POPULATION  State scientists say the deer population in the state is increasing, bringing more ticks and the risk of more Lyme disease. A survey by the wildlife division of the Department of Environmental Protection shows an estimated statewide count of 75,000 white-tail deer. The department counted deer in 11 zones while there was snow cover last winter, the first periodic aerial deer census since 1996. The state average was about 21 per square mile, up from the average of 15 four years ago.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: BUDGET SURPLUS  The strong economy and higher-than-expected income tax revenues will push the state budget surplus to $470.2 million to close out the fiscal year, the state comptroller, Nancy Wyman, said Monday. Her latest surplus estimate is $56.8 million higher than last month's projection. The income tax will bring in $275.4 million more than was expected. Ms. Wyman warned, however, that state spending was expected to rise about 6 percent over the next year, outpacing the 5.4 percent growth in revenue.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>CARNEY'S POINT: NEW TOLL PLAZA  New Jersey Turnpike officials say a new $44 million toll plaza will end traffic tie-ups at Interchange 1 and make New Jerseyans proud. Edward Gross, the executive director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, said, ''Just about everyone I've shown the design to says it's very attractive.'' Construction is to begin next year on the plaza, a few miles from the Delaware Memorial Bridge and 1.2 miles north of the existing, 50-year-old plaza. Its opening is scheduled for June 2003.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 6, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, a brief report in some copies yesterday  about an armed robbery at a Manhattan nightclub on Tuesday misstated the number of men who were arrested. Three men were being sought in the crime, the police said, but only one had been arrested.</p>
