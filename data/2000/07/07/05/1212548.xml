        <p>To Sip Sauternes</p>
        <p>A tasting of 10 Sauternes, including a 1950 Chateau Suduiraut and a 1959 La Tour Blanche, will be held on July 20 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the Honors Bridge Club, 115 East 57th Street.

        <p>Let Them Eat Well</p>
        <p>The grand finale of an intensive one-week chefs' course with Madeleine Kamman at Johnson and Wales University in Providence, R.I., will be a Bastille Day dinner. The menu, from 1789, might be one that Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would have savored. The eight chefs who are taking the course, which begins next week, will decide the details, but there's bound to be brioche.</p>
        <p>The dinner, on July 14, will start with a 6 p.m. Champagne reception and will be given in the Angelica Dining Room at the university's Harborside Campus, off Allens Avenue. The fee, $100, benefits the scholarship fund. Reservations: (401) 598-1807.</p>
