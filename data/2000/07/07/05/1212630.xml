        <p>Almost 40 percent of Idaho is national forest, and nearly half of that land cannot be reached by road. So in a debate about roads, forests and the future, the talk here has been anything but abstract.</p>
        <p>It is Idaho, more than any other state, that would bear the brunt of a Clinton administration plan to bar future roadbuilding across most remaining unroaded parts of the country's national forest land. And while many here regard the plan as a gift to future generations, in Idaho, with its tradition of stubborn individualism, the plan is also being widely portrayed as a federal assault on a way of life.</p>
        <p>''The scum in Washington, D.C., are taking our freedom away from us once again,'' Gaylen Hamilton, a logger and fifth-generation Idahoan said at a public meeting here on Thursday night where he and scores of other timber workers voiced adamant opposition to the Clinton plan.</p>
        <p>The session was among the last of more than 300 held by the Forest Service around the country in the last 45 days to solicit public comment about the proposal, and the anger reflected opposition that could still emerge as an obstacle to the plan, which President Clinton hopes will become part of his legacy.</p>
        <p>''I think we Pacific Northwesterners ought to tell them Easterners to get the hell out of our area,'' said Larry Paulson, a rancher in his 40's, at the session here last week. ''Clinton, Gore and whoever else is managing things back there: Leave us alone!''</p>
        <p>The nine million acres of roadless area in Idaho affected by the proposal is the most of any state. Already, Idaho officials have filed one suit against the proposal, and the state's Congressional delegation, including Senator Larry Craig, a Republican, is trying to push through legislation intended to postpone any rulemaking until after Mr. Clinton leaves office.</p>
        <p>In seeking to put the plan in place, the administration has elected to bypass Congress, a tactic that has been loudly condemned by many Western Republicans, including Idaho's governor, Dirk Kempthorne.</p>
        <p>''It's this kind of unilateral land-management decision by the federal government that further deepens the mistrust and skepticism that comes naturally to those of us in the West,'' Governor Kempthorne, a Republican, wrote recently in a commentary in The Idaho Statesman, the state's largest newspaper.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which Mr. Clinton announced last fall and the Forest Service released in draft form in April, would put 43 million acres of national forest land off limits to future roadbuilding, as a step to protect them from development. That would comprise nearly one-fourth of the entire forest system, including most of the land not already crisscrossed by 386,000 miles of road built by the Forest Service, usually to ease logging.</p>
        <p>With strong support from environmental groups, Vice President Al Gore has said he would go even further, by extending the ban to include roadless areas of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the nation's largest, and by explicitly banning logging in all areas deemed off limits to roads.</p>
        <p>At most public meetings across the country, according to Forest Service officials and news accounts, supporters of that kind of far-reaching measure have usually outnumbered opponents, and they have made their presence felt with demonstrations like a horn-honking parade in Market Square in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>But in the Mountain West in general, and Idaho in particular, the picture is more complicated. Advocates of a roadbuilding ban have clashed with loggers, state officials, advocates of off-road vehicles and others who contend that a halt to new roads would squander a vital resource.</p>
        <p>One hearing, in Missoula, Mont., near Idaho's eastern border, attracted some 2,000 people, and included testimony so raucous that an account on the Forest Service's own Web site bore the headline: ''Roadless Rage.''</p>
        <p>About 300 people showed up at the Nampa Civic Center on Thursday night, including Cathy Nuxholl, a 43-year-old teacher and hiker from Boise who argued that there was no need to build any more roads. The Forest Service already maintains 30,000 miles of roads in Idaho alone, Ms. Nuxholl noted, pleading for the remaining roadless areas to be protected as ''islands in a sea of human activity.''</p>
        <p>But such views were all but drowned out by the loggers, many of whom had been bused to the event by Boise-Cascade, the largest timber company in the state.</p>
        <p>''If you can't log it and you don't maintain it, it's going to be destroyed,'' said Melvin Crabb, a third-generation timber worker, echoing an industry argument  about the danger of fire on unlogged land. ''To take this away from me is to take it from the fourth generation, my son.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in tiny Idaho timber towns like Orofino on the fringes of the giant Clearwater National Forest in west-central Idaho, where the Konkolville Lumber Company owns the mill, a steakhouse and motel, it is almost impossible to find anyone who favors the ban on building roads.</p>
        <p>''What's the use of having a natural area if you can't get to it?'' asked Jerry Philpot, 59, as he sipped a late-afternoon beer in the company-owned bar. A lifelong logger, Mr. Philpot said roads were vital not only to his livelihood, but also to his recreation, as the routes to hunting and fishing.</p>
        <p>A scaling back in federal timber sales have forced deep cuts in logging on federal land in Idaho and across the Northwest in the last 10 years. Even so, Boise Cascade still relies on national forests for half its harvest, and timber executives like Donald J. Konkol, Konkolville's president, said they had been hoping that new sales would be approved, including some which would have required the construction of roads on what are now roadless areas.</p>
        <p>''Our whole future is at stake,'' Mr. Konkol said after testifying last week at a hearing in the Orofino High School gymnasium.</p>
        <p>Unlike congressionally designated wilderness areas, where logging, road construction and even off-road vehicle activity is banned, roadless areas of the national forests have long been open to a wide range of activities, subject to decisions by local forest managers.</p>
        <p>An inventory by the Idaho Conservation League, released in September, found that 95 logging projects in roadless areas were on the planning books in the state's national forests. The projects planned for the next five years would lead to the development of another 70,000 acres of roadless forest, the organization reported, adding to 1.1 million acres of forest in the state developed by logging and road construction in the last 12 years.</p>
        <p>By contrast, if the Clinton plan is approved, according to Forest Service estimates, annual timber sales from national forest lands in Idaho could decline as much as 20 percent from current levels, and could result in the loss of as many as 180 jobs.</p>
        <p>Idaho officials say the damage would be far greater, depriving the state of at least $163 million in timber revenue in the next 30 years that would have been set aside for spending on roads and schools.</p>
        <p>The Forest Service hearings, which began on May 17, were the most extensive ever held by a Federal agency to solicit comment about a proposed change in government rules; 30 meetings were held in Idaho alone. A main reason for that approach, Clinton administration officials have said, was to insulate the decision making from legal or Congressional challenges.</p>
        <p>The public-comment period ends on July 17. After reviewing an estimated one million letters and e-mail messages, the Forest Service is planning to issue its final decision before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>In conversations on Thursday, opponents of the plan have said they were glad to have a chance to shout but doubted that their voices would be heard. And in this overwhelmingly Republican state, few made much secret of their disdain for the current administration.</p>
        <p>One speaker, Roger Lord, complained that the proposal had been drafted ''in a dark room of the White House'' by ''incredibly arrogant and power-corrupted politicians and equally arrogant environmental elites.''</p>
        <p>''I came here to spit into the wind,'' Mr. Lord said.</p>
