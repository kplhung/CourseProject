        <p>Re: ''Sweet Bounty Returns: Sea Scallops,'' June 21. Scallops are scarce because they have been overfished for decades.

        <p>But in both areas scalloping has profoundly damaged the ocean's delicate ecosystem. Scallop dredges are highly efficient tools: nothing escapes them. And they haul up far more than scallops, including flounder, haddock, skate, hydrozoa, starfish and crabs. Most are dead by the time they are dumped back into the sea. The emerging lesson is that if we want to continue to enjoy scallops as food, we must manage our fisheries as ecosystems. This means managing the resource for the long haul, not as an underwater boomtown, for even if a given species quickly rebounds, the ecosystem seldom does.  ANTHONY CHATWIN  Boston</p>
