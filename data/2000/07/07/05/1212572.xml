        <p>My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I tried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living. Canines that can hold their heads high as they approach their supper dishes. Animals whose vet bills could be a tax-deductible expense for their owners.</p>

        <p>My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks were only vaguely attentive as I tried to explain to them that some dogs actually work for a living. Canines that can hold their heads high as they approach their supper dishes. Animals whose vet bills could be a tax-deductible expense for their owners.</p>
        <p>My dogs yawned as their attention drifted to a chattering squirrel. They gave me their how-long-until-we-are-fed look and wandered deeper into the backyard.</p>
        <p>I sighed and returned to my growing list of what working-class dogs do for a living. I was helped by a new book, ''Dogs With Jobs: Working Dogs Around the World,'' by Merrily Weisbord and Kim Kachanoff (Pocket Books, $24.95). The possibilities are impressive. There are dogs that work as actors and guards; there are dogs that aid the blind, the deaf and the ill. There are dogs that work for the police, sniffing out drugs, bombs and missing bodies. Then there are racing dogs, rescue and show dogs. There are dogs that herd cattle and sheep, and dogs that serve as companions for patients in nursing homes and hospitals.</p>
        <p>Of course, most dogs do duty as family pets, and that role should not be made light of. These stalwarts provide love and security to tens of millions of Americans.</p>
        <p>But I wanted to check out some working dogs -- dogs with real jobs, that work each day in a particular place with a particular goal. I was interested in canines that, if they had two legs instead of four, would be entitled to the minimum wage. Dogs like Smokey, who works as a fire department mascot and guard dog in Paterson, N.J.; Pearl, who herds cattle in New Mexico; Royce, who sniffs out illegal drugs for the sheriff's department in Essex County, N.J.; and Moki, who works as a companion to residents of a nursing home in California.</p>
        <p>The firefighters at the Northside Firehouse on Temple Street in Paterson call Smokey, a friendly 9-year-old mixed breed who looks mostly like a German shepherd, a ''Paterson street dog.'' But it's a compliment to his street smarts, not a slur on his lineage.</p>
        <p>Smokey has lived and worked at the firehouse since he was a puppy and two firefighters brought him there from an animal shelter in Newark.</p>
        <p>Dave Coughlan, a Paterson firefighter who usually watches after Smokey, says the dog doesn't go on as many fire calls as he did when he was younger. ''We watch him a little more carefully now,'' he said. ''We don't want him to get hurt.'' But that hasn't stopped him from working: when he's not on a fire call, he stays behind and guards the firehouse until the firefighters return.</p>
        <p>''He's had his share of battle wounds -- stitches for cuts from broken glass and stuff like that,'' Mr. Coughlan said.</p>
        <p>When Smokey goes to a fire, he often beats the firefighters inside a burning building. ''He's looking for people and pets,'' Mr. Coughlan said. ''Many times he's beaten me into a building and then come out choking while I'm still getting my gear on. Later, he'll check to make sure we're all safe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coughlan sometimes takes Smokey to his house for a visit. ''But after a few hours, he wants to get back to the firehouse,'' Mr. Coughlan said. ''It's his home.''</p>
        <p>Wherever John Gard goes, Pearl is usually right by his side. Or, more precisely, by the side of his cattle.</p>
        <p>Pearl, a 10-year-old bluish-black-and-white Scottish border collie, helps Mr. Gard, who is 80, run cattle on 9,000 acres near Gladstone, in northeastern New Mexico.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Gard is working from the back of a horse or behind the wheel of a truck, Pearl stays busy helping him round up stray cattle and move herds into corrals or from pasture to pasture.</p>
        <p>''She's a big help,'' Mr. Gard said. ''She really works.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gard got Pearl when she was a puppy and trained her himself. ''Pearl and border collies like her are only happy when they're working,'' he said. ''They want to work, and they learn easily.''</p>
        <p>He said that like many border collies, Pearl is a master of getting cattle to do her bidding without hurting them. ''These dogs are best for working cattle, I think,'' he said. ''They mainly snap at the heels, just enough to scare the cattle.''</p>
        <p>For many years, Mr. Gard has used border collies on his ranch and can't imagine being without one. ''Pearl takes care of me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gabe Rispoli, a detective with the canine unit of the Essex County sheriff's department, had carefully hidden two plastic bags of cocaine and marijuana in an abandoned building next to his unit's offices in Belleville, N.J. Then, when Detective Chris Di Rocco gave the command, Royce -- a 3-year-old black mixed Labrador and retriever -- bounded into action. Within seconds he had found the first stash in a discarded file cabinet; with equal dispatch he found the second in the drawer of a old desk. In both cases he signaled his discovery by frantically pawing at the hiding places.</p>
        <p>Royce is a specialist in sniffing out narcotics. He is one of three dogs used for that purpose by the canine unit. Ten other dogs of various breeds, including bloodhounds and German shepherds, are used to find bombs, detect arson, track suspects or missing people or help in search-and-rescue operations.</p>
        <p>Royce came to the sheriff's department from Morristown, N.J., after the Seeing Eye organization, which trains dogs to aid blind people, rejected him because of a short attention span. But this characteristic made him perfect for rapid police searches.</p>
        <p>''Royce is an amazing dog,'' said Detective DiRocco, who is the dog's human partner and takes him home when the two aren't on duty. ''He loves to work, and he loves to play. And he knows the difference.''</p>
        <p>Moki is on duty 24 hours a day at the Vista Del Sol Care Center, a nursing home in Culver City, Calif. During rounds each morning, he visits patients; later, he meets them in an exercise room.</p>
        <p>Moki, who is a year old, is a black and white peekapoo, or a cross between a Pekingese and a miniature poodle.</p>
        <p>Stella Henry, a nurse who is a co-founder and director of the nursing home, says Moki has had an extremely positive effect on the patients. She cites examples of usually unresponsive patients who have reacted to Moki by petting him and talking to him.</p>
        <p>She says attendance and laughter at activities programs increase as Moki ''works the room'' and ''earns his keep.''</p>
        <p>''Moki sees no age, no wrinkles, no tremors and no tubes,'' she added. ''His expertise lies in giving unconditional love.''</p>
