        <p>Negligence by Russian commanders enabled Chechen suicide bombers to carry out the devastating attacks on Sunday that killed more than 30 soldiers, the chief of Russia's intelligence service said today.</p>
        <p>Nikolai Patrushev, director of the Federal Security Service, said that his agency had alerted the Russian military that attacks were being planned but that some had failed to take proper precautions.</p>
        <p>''There was a mistake on the part of commanders in the field,'' he said. ''We have to act in a coordinated fashion to prevent such things from happening in the future.''</p>
        <p>Five trucks loaded with munitions exploded in Chechnya on Sunday night, catching the Russian military by surprise and shocking the nation. Today, Russian officials put the final toll at 33 dead, 84 wounded and 3 missing.</p>
        <p>Trying to restore control over towns and settlements in the secessionist region, Russian officials today issued a ''shoot on sight'' order for any vehicle breaching a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew. New checkpoints have been set up, and many Chechens were reportedly staying home.</p>
        <p>About 30 people have been detained, but it is not clear if the Russian authorities have found any of those who organized the bombings.</p>
        <p>A series of devastating explosions in apartment buildings in other parts of Russia in September helped build public support for the war. Russian officials said the Chechen rebels were to blame, but there is no conclusive proof of their role.</p>
        <p>In the bombings on Sunday, most of the casualties occurred in Argun, a town east of Grozny, where a truck bomb slammed into a dormitory occupied by a militia unit.</p>
        <p>Despite alerts of possible attacks, there was no concrete barrier or other obstacle to stop the truck, which may have been operated by two suicide bombers, from approaching the building.</p>
        <p>Providing new details of that attack, Russia television reported tonight that 22 policemen had been killed and 48 wounded. Many of the dead and wounded were buried under the debris.</p>
        <p>After the bomb exploded, Chechen snipers began shooting at the building, and a gunfight raged for an hour and a half.</p>
        <p>While Russian officials said negligence was a factor, they said the poor security was the fault of local commanders, not Gen. Ivan Babichev, the military commandant of Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The destruction in Argun ''resulted from the failure to comply with an order by General Babichev that additional security measures were to be taken,'' said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the senior Russian government spokesman on the war.</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin has kept a low profile in recent days and has had little to say about the bombing attacks, which have challenged the Kremlin's claims to control the breakaway region.</p>
        <p>The rebels, for their part, were more vocal. They promised more attacks, warning civilians to move away from Russian bases and command posts.</p>
        <p>Shamil Basayev, the Chechen guerrilla leader, demanded that the Russian authorities hand over a Russian officer accused of the rape and murder of a Chechen woman, according to a Chechen spokesman, Movladi Udogov. Otherwise, Mr. Basayev vowed, there will be more bombing attacks.</p>
