        <p>Victor in Mexico Pledges To Clean Up Legal System  President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada said he would rebuild the country's federal law enforcement system, moving it toward an American model of justice as a way to wipe out the corruption that has crippled Mexico for decades.

        <p>Zimbabwe Economy Suffering  Economists predict that the coming months will bring more hardship to Zimbabwe, which is already staggering through its worst economic crisis since 1980. That assessment, in a United Nations report, came as expectations among the poor rose with the opposition's strong showing in parliamentary elections.</p>

        <p>Finding a Way Around Congress  Aides to President Clinton say that with the Republican-controlled Congress not inclined to give Democrats comfort in an election year, the administration intends to continue making policy by decree -- putting federal land off limits to developers, reorganizing agencies, tightening pollution rules and pushing other measures that stand little chance of Congressional passage. The aides also do not rule out summer recess appointments of nominees still awaiting Senate confirmation.</p>

        <p>Benefit, Risk and the Pill  A study suggests that while women taking birth control pills are at higher risk of stroke, the risk is outweighed by the contraceptive benefits of the pills. Further, it said, strokes are so rare in women of reproductive age that the increase in risk is of little significance.</p>
