        <p>JUNE appears to have been the worst month in domestic airline history for delayed flights, preliminary statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration indicate. The big question now is, will the trend continue as record numbers of passengers crowd onto planes, making this summer even worse than last for the prospect of getting there on time?</p>
        <p>In general, bad weather accounts for about 70 percent of flight delays, which are the bane of business travel. This June, a greater-than-normal number of thunderstorms contributed to the pile-up of delays, which rose sharply against the expectations of the airline industry and the F.A.A. Only a month earlier, both had been pointing hopefully to some signs that things might be improving after three years of rapidly deteriorating on-time performance.</p>
        <p>In May, for example, delays fell 7 percent from May 1999. That was one month after the F.A.A. and the airlines put into place an ambitious new strategy called the Spring/Summer 2000 Severe Weather Plan. This allowed the F.A.A.'s main traffic center in Virginia to function as a kind of super control tower to coordinate operations hour-by-hour with the airlines and help regional radar centers integrate traffic throughout the nation's air space.</p>
        <p>But here are the latest statistics compiled by the F.A.A. just before the long Fourth of July holiday: From June 1 to June 28, airlines reported more than 44,000 delays. That compares with about 38,000 delays in the similar period for June 1999, when a total of 39,533 flights were delayed for the whole month. The previous record number of delays -- 45,162 -- came in July last year. Given even a routine number of delays the last two days of this June, that record is likely to be broken when the final statistics for the month are compiled.</p>
        <p>''All you can do is try and provide factual information,'' said Steven J. Brown, the acting associate administrator for air traffic services at the F.A.A. ''We have a collaborative effort with the airlines in making the daily plan and adjusting it hourly. If we failed, we should say it. But if, in fact, the collaboration is making a difference, which I believe there is plenty of evidence for, then we should provide the objective measures to talk about that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that it was difficult to say whether the plan would succeed in actually reducing delays this summer over last, since the June statistics were skewed by an atypical number of thunderstorms that raked major air corridors in the central and southwestern United States.</p>
        <p>Some airlines have cut a small number of flights from their schedules this summer, partly in anticipation of delays. UAL's United Airlines, which is grappling with a labor dispute in which some pilots have refused to work overtime, recently canceled more than 4,500 flights throughout the summer. United has about 2,500 flights a day. Its pilots union has said that the airline unfairly blames it for flight cancellations and delays.</p>
        <p>Some other airlines might also reduce their summer schedules, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>''United was the first to come out and say for a number of reasons they felt they needed to rationalize their schedule,'' he said. ''I know from talking with the airlines over the last week that others are considering'' dropping some scheduled flights.</p>
        <p>In general, however, airlines operate on razor-thin profit margins and are not likely to deliberately cut revenue significantly, even if it means a summer of mounting flight delays and unhappy customers.</p>
        <p>Flight delays are a constant headache for business travelers, who are the airlines' most lucrative source of revenue.</p>
        <p>Among those delayed in June was Kevin Mitchell, the director of the Business Travel Coalition, a trade group that lobbies for more airline competition and lower fares on behalf of businesses. Last Thursday night, Mr. Mitchell cooled his heels in Detroit thanks to a Northwest Airlines 5:30 p.m. flight that was delayed for hours before he finally got a 9 p.m. flight on US Airways. The delay caused him to forgo a 7:30 a.m. meeting in Washington the next day.</p>
        <p>''I know we've had a lot of bad weather in the last 60 days, but these delays are a real burden,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For businesses, frequent airline delays mean that valuable employees are ''sitting around for hours unproductive,'' he said, adding that businesses are also beginning to assess the impact of delays on employee morale.</p>
        <p>A delay is defined by the F.A.A. as a flight that arrives at the gate more than 15 minutes behind schedule. But average delay times now exceed an hour, according to industry statistics.</p>
        <p>As customers fume, the airline industry has sought to shift much of the blame to the F.A.A., which the industry says has been slow in replacing inadequate technology even as air travel demand has grown steadily. This year, the F.A.A. estimates, airlines will carry about 640 million passengers in the United States, compared with about 460 million in 1990.</p>
        <p>But the airlines themselves have been accused of exaggerating the role of weather in the delay crisis. And frequent fliers know that on some flights, some airlines have begun adding minutes to the posted flying times to keep delay statistics in check. As a result, on days when the airspace is humming efficiently, some flights arrive well ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>''Messing around with the schedules, padding them a bit to help improve on-time arrivals, is pretty common in the industry,'' Mr. Mitchell said. ''You'll sometimes hear the captain announcing that we're going to arrive, say 45 minutes early because there's a strong breeze behind us -- which flies in the face of reason.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the F.A.A.'s Mr. Brown said he believed that the new system was working and that delays could begin to drop this summer ''if by some miracle the weather turns more favorable during July and August.''</p>
        <p>Under the new centralized system, federal air traffic employees in the 20 regional radar-control centers are for the first time all using identical technology, thanks to a recently completed modernization of the agency's computer hardware and software. Other new air control measures include putting some aircraft into lower-than-normal altitudes below 30,000 feet -- which marginally increases capacity but at the cost of fuel efficiency for aircraft that are routed into those lower altitudes when the system is crowded, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. has a new Web site  (www.fly.faa.gov) showing a national map with links that provide current delay information for more than 30 major United States airports. Mr. Brown said that the Web site was started in April ''as part of our new collaborative initiative with the airlines and, broadly, with the general public to provide more planning and consumer oriented information.'' He continued, ''It's updated, hourly or more frequently,'' adding that the information on the site is reliable enough that ''we use it inside our facilities for decision making.''</p>
        <p>The Transportation Department, meanwhile, is working on a detailed report that will examine the reasons for flight delays and cancellations, from weather problems to airline staffing, maintenance, flight-schedule and fare-schedule issues. A preliminary report submitted to Congress last week documented a 50 percent increase in delays, and a 68 percent increase in cancellations of flights, over the last five years. At the largest 28 airports, delays exceeding an hour after leaving the gate increased 130 percent in that period.</p>
        <p>At best, Mr. Brown said, the F.A.A. and the industry expect ''marginal, incremental steps'' aimed at improving on-time performance. But even in the best of circumstances, assuming better-than-average flying weather for the rest of the summer, the new joint government-industry efforts are not expected to do much more than barely maintain the current situation against the ever-increasing number of airline passengers, either this summer or in the long term.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, Mr. Brown noted, the number of domestic flights has consistently risen 3 to 4 percent annually. No one expects that demand to fall in the foreseeable future. And, given the unlikelihood of new airports being built or additional runways being added in major air traffic bottlenecks like the Eastern Seaboard, no one is predicting a day anytime soon when the system will be able to easily handle the demands placed on it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said: ''The questions are: Will demand continue to grow more than our ability to meet it on an annual basis? Or will demand slow down a little bit, and we'll be able to catch up? We have the ability to increase the capacity of the system, but only at a level that's a fraction of this annual increase in demand. We've already done all the easy things.''</p>
