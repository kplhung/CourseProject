        <p>Israelis and Palestinians alike reacted cautiously today to a declaration by the Palestinian leadership on Monday that a Palestinian state would be declared by mid-September, uncertain whether it was a promise, a threat or another deadline that could be massaged.</p>
        <p>In the streets of Ramallah in the West Bank, many Palestinians tried to check their enthusiasm, which was egged on by headlines across the tops of newspapers proclaiming, ''Palestinian State on 9/13!''</p>
        <p>Several Palestinians said they were ready to shed blood if necessary, but they warned each other not to put too much stake in a deadline, given that other supposedly sacred dates had come and gone.</p>
        <p>And then were those like Ziyyad, 26, a shopper who would not give his last name. He said Palestinian leaders would be irresponsible to make a unilateral declaration of statehood because it would set off a harsh Israeli response that would ultimately cause the Palestinian people to suffer.</p>
        <p>''More border closings, separation again between the West Bank and Gaza, economic hardship, more settlements and no prisoners released,'' he said. ''Our leaders should be more rational.''</p>
        <p>In Israel even dovish leaders like Justice Minister Yossi Beilin recoiled from the idea that the Palestinians might abandon the peace effort and proclaim an independent state. He warned that a Palestinian state would be meaningless if Israel did not recognize it.</p>
        <p>''It will exist only on paper even if the entire world recognizes a unilateral Palestinian state,'' Mr. Beilin said, in unusually confrontational words for him.</p>
        <p>On Monday night the Palestinian Central Council unexpectedly affirmed its commitment to declare a Palestinian state by Sept. 13, whether or not a final peace deal is reached with the Israelis. That is the target date for a completed deal, although it is highly unlikely that it will be met.</p>
        <p>The council, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was not expected to attach such significance to the Sept. 13 date. Rather, it was believed that the council would endorse the idea of a state by year's end, so as to defuse growing anxieties that September will bring violence if it does not bring peace.</p>
        <p>Instead, the council made a decision that locks Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, into a tight time frame and raises his people's hopes.</p>
        <p>On Israel Radio today, Bassam Sayeh, a member of Al Fatah, Mr. Arafat's group within the P.L.O., said that while the Palestinians preferred to achieve statehood through negotiations, they were prepared to do so through military conflict if necessary.</p>
        <p>In an opinion poll released today, which was taken late last month, slightly more than half of the 1,200 Palestinians interviewed said they expected nothing to happen in September -- not a state and not a peace agreement.</p>
