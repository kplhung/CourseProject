        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Growing Up, Growing Apart'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 25), you describe the wall between the races. This is just one of many walls among people.</p>
        <p>I threw a house-warming party 20 years ago for my Bell Labs associates as well as for friends I had in New York and New Jersey. Except for one black and one white department head and me, all others seemed to segregate themselves along diverse lines. The young and the old seemed to split; black and white seemed to split; and what I found most telling was that New York blacks and New Jersey blacks seemed to split.</p>

        <p>I am a 66-year-old black man. Despite ubiquitous prejudice, the person I am affects the nature of my relationships much more than the color of my skin. Very few of us interact, question and go where the truth leads us. Until we are able to change the nature of most people, the walls you identify as well as many others will remain.</p>
