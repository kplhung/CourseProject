        <p>Congress appears intent on denying President Clinton major legislative victories in his final months of office, but White House officials say they will continue drafting and carrying out policies, Congress or no Congress, until Mr. Clinton's final day.</p>
        <p>Through executive orders, memorandums, proclamations, regulations and other flexing of presidential power, Mr. Clinton has already put in effect a host of measures concerning the environment, health care and civil rights. And with the presidential campaign in high gear, and the Republican-controlled Congress not inclined to give Democrats any boost, Mr. Clinton's aides intend to continue making policy by decree -- putting federal land off limits to development, reorganizing government agencies, tightening pollution control rules and pushing other measures that would otherwise stand little chance of congressional passage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has been especially frustrated that many of his nominees for judgeships, ambassadorships and other posts have failed to be confirmed by the Senate. But he is not surrendering in that area either. If Congress fails to act on some of the nominations later this month, White House aides say they expect the president to make recess appointments in August that would require no Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>''This president will be signing executive orders right up until the morning of Jan. 20, 2001,'' said Bruce N. Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser. ''In our experience, when the administration takes executive action, it not only leads to results while the political process is stuck in neutral, but it often spurs Congress to follow suit.''</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, in a radio address on high prices for gasoline and other fuels, Mr. Clinton said that if Congress did not act, he would use his own authority to create a home-heating-oil reserve to help avoid shortages in the Northeast. The House has approved such a reserve, but the Senate has not acted on the proposal. Mr. Clinton said he had asked Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ''to take the steps necessary to create a reserve through administrative authority if Congress does fail to act, so that a heating oil reserve will be in place next winter.''</p>
        <p>Another goal of executive actions these days, of course, is to aid Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. It was Mr. Clinton who signed the order earlier this year granting increased protection to 250,000 acres of federal land in Oregon and Washington State. But it was Mr. Gore who announced the creation of the Cascade-Siskiyou and Hanford Reach National Monuments, an act that pleased environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Over the course of his seven and a half years as president, Mr. Clinton has signed an average of about one executive order or other policy-making declaration a week, or 450 in all, according to the Office of Management and Budget. That far exceeds the executive actions taken by former Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan, whose orders riled Congressional Democrats just as much as Mr. Clinton's have angered Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''I think what this president is doing is pretty typical when Congress is controlled by the other party,'' said Louis Fisher, who has studied executive authority for the Congressional Research Service. ''Certainly, Nixon did the same thing.''</p>
        <p>But the fact that presidents in both parties have engaged in the practice -- President George Washington, a Federalist, issued the first one in 1793 dealing with American neutrality in the war between Britain and France -- does not assuage the frustration on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers argue that the Constitution gives them, not Mr. Clinton,  the authority to pass laws.</p>
        <p>''Even though I disagree with the president on many of the issues, the bigger concern is the erosion of the foundation that our founding fathers put in place,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. ''It's very dangerous for a president to implement policy by essentially debasing the constitutional structure.''</p>
        <p>Republicans have complained most fervently about Mr. Clinton's liberal use of the Antiquities Act of 1906 to protect ''objects of historic and scientific interest.'' The protests began in earnest in 1996 when Mr. Clinton set up the 1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah, which was opposed by Republican lawmakers in the state. Recent presidential directives protect land in California, Arizona and other states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton points to his predecessors to justify his approach. Former President Jimmy Carter, for instance, signed an order creating a national monument in Alaska that exceeded 53 million acres. Mr. Clinton now holds the record for total land set aside in the lower 48 states.</p>
        <p>On Friday, asked about whether he was overstepping his role, Mr. Clinton delivered an impromptu history of the executive branch that compared his actions with those of other presidents. Mr. Clinton acknowledged that the office he holds has grown over the years, but he said many of his predecessors have advanced the power of the presidency without interrupting the constitutional balance envisioned by the founders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton noted that Thomas Jefferson had agreed to the Louisiana Purchase for a sum, $15 million, that was roughly the total annual budget for the federal government at the time. ''Can you imagine what the Congress would say if I said I want to buy a little land but it will only cost $1.8 trillion?'' Mr. Clinton said with a smile. (In fact, the treaty with France to cede its vast territories to the United States had to be ratified by the Senate, and Congress passed a number of laws in 1803 to carry out the transaction.)</p>
        <p>No consensus has emerged on Capitol Hill on whether future presidents ought to be reined in. Legislation limiting the acres that presidents can protect with the stroke of a pen cleared the House but not the Senate. Bills requiring Mr. Clinton to justify his executive orders to Congress or win subsequent approval from lawmakers have also stalled.</p>
        <p>Just once has a court ruled that Mr. Clinton has overstepped his bounds, after he signed an order in 1995 that banned awarding federal contracts to employers that permanently replace striking employees. Several members of Congress filed suit to block another order to protect rivers, but a federal court ruled that the lawmakers' injury was ''clearly institutional rather than personal.'' In another instance, the House voted in 1998 to deny money to carry out an  executive order dealing with when the federal government could get involved in state and local matters. Mr. Clinton later withdrew the order.</p>
        <p>Executive actions can be undone just as quickly as they were put in effect. But White House officials say a future president would face political constraints against reducing protections on federal lands. On other matters, Mr. Clinton himself showed how quickly presidential declarations can disappear.</p>
        <p>Days after Mr. Clinton took office in 1993, he told Donna E. Shalala,  secretary for health and human services, to overturn former President Bush's moratorium on federal financing of research involving fetal tissues from induced abortions.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers have little doubt that the next president, whether it is Mr. Gore or Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, will continue the pattern of past presidents.</p>
        <p>''I do not believe that the romance with the executive order is restricted to the Clinton White House,'' said Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has held hearings on the issue. ''Every president has used them. Some, though, have used more restraint than others.''</p>
