        <p>The biographer of Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesia's unpredictable president, thinks he has him figured out: he is the drunken swordsman in the martial arts movie who disarms his enemies with his seeming foolishness, then cuts them down.</p>
        <p>''He's a great master who looks like a complete walk-over,'' said the biographer, Greg Barton, an Australian political scientist. ''Suddenly there's a whirl of limbs and then everyone is lying on the floor.''</p>
        <p>The swords are out again this week as the president and his many opponents start slicing the air in advance of a special parliamentary session next month.</p>
        <p>Some people are talking about impeachment, although the national assembly does not technically have that power. At the least, it will be a grandstand for the national harangue that has dogged Mr. Wahid since his improbable election last October.</p>
        <p>Nobody saw it coming -- though by now they should have -- when Mr. Wahid (who in fact is not a drinker) announced that the police would investigate up to 10 members of Parliament on suspicion of fomenting violence and unrest.</p>
        <p>Then came his now-familiar pattern of verbal feints and jabs.</p>
        <p>''There is one big fish,'' he said on Saturday, ''but we haven't found the supporting evidence yet. Once we catch him it will all be over.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, according to a local newspaper, he said: ''I have ordered the police to arrest and interrogate those suspected of creating or being involved in riots. With or without evidence they have to be captured.''</p>
        <p>On Monday his cabinet secretary, Marsilam Simanjuntak, said the president had signed an order for the investigation of the legislators.</p>
        <p>Today, with newspaper headlines blurting ''Confusion Reigns,'' the president said: ''I've never accused the legislators of being guilty. My other statement was twisted for political purposes.''</p>
        <p>It doesn't take much of a poke in Jakarta to get the bees out the beehive. The city is abuzz now with rumors and political scurrying as people name names, point fingers and nudge the points of their knives into one another's backs.</p>
        <p>Two members of the cabinet of former President Suharto -- Ginandjar Kartasasmita and Fuad Bawazier -- found themselves angrily denying that they were on Mr. Wahid's list.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bawazier did not seem to help his case much when he denied a suggestion that he was financing armed groups by saying: ''The accusations are baseless. It is normal that I give donations to the needy.''</p>
        <p>It may be a diverting spectacle, but the stakes are high. Indonesia is -- as the pilots of jetliners say when they turn on the seat-belt sign --  passing through a period of turbulence after the ouster of Mr. Suharto two years ago.</p>
        <p>As it does so, it sometimes seems that Mr. Wahid is alone at the controls. And there are disconcerting moments when he seems, willfully, to be steering into the thunderheads.</p>
        <p>There are those who say Mr. Wahid is his own worst enemy, undermining Indonesia's stability and economic recovery by his impulsiveness and his tendency to cry wolf. Although economic analysts insist that in real terms the economy is on an upturn, the confidence of investors has continued to sink.</p>
        <p>Amid all the political noise, the currency, the rupiah, fell to below 9,000 to the dollar today, its lowest point in 16 months.</p>
        <p>The catch-phrase in Jakarta now is: ''The best thing the president could do for the economy is to keep his mouth shut for a while.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid's defenders say that shutting his mouth would in effect be laying down his weapons. With few political cards to play, they say, the president is lucky that he is an expert bluffer.</p>
        <p>The back-room coalition he yanked together last October to win the presidency has mostly turned against him, ready to devour him when he presents his state of the nation address to the assembly next month.</p>
        <p>And he is operating without much of a functioning bureaucracy, which was eviscerated by Mr. Suharto during his 32-year rule. Where Mr. Suharto kept his opponents at bay by force of arms, Mr. Wahid must operate by the force of his personality.</p>
        <p>That is how he undercut his recalcitrant military chief, General Wiranto, in February, pummeling him with a barrage of intemperate remarks and finally dismissing him.</p>
        <p>The newly empowered legislature -- an embarrassingly obedient body under Mr. Suharto - has roared to life as what one analyst called a ''crocodile pit'' of political agendas, or what Mr. Wahid himself once called ''a kindergarten.''</p>
        <p>The legislators fired the first shot last Friday when they voted to call in the president later this month -- ahead of the assembly -- to explain his firing of two cabinet ministers in April.</p>
        <p>Even as he fights back, the president is faced with a surge of violent unrest around the country.</p>
        <p>There is a religious war in the far eastern Maluku islands, where more than 2,500 Christians and Muslims have been killed in the last 18 months. There has been communal fighting on the islands of Sulawesi, Bali and Lombok. There have been bomb blasts at mosques and churches. And there are insurgencies in the provinces of Aceh and Irian Jaya that appear to be receiving outside aid.</p>
        <p>The unseen hands behind them may include military plotters, local power blocs, ambitious politicians and people from the former government.</p>
        <p>Their message, said Mr. Barton, is: '' 'Back off or we'll make problems.' It's a sort of hostage situation; it doesn't take a lot of money to set things off. From others, it's, 'Let's see what a weak leader he is.' There are all sorts of crazies, all sorts of people trying their thing, trying to get him to take them seriously.''</p>
        <p>It is a lot for one man to handle. And, according to Mr. Barton, it is a battle the president relishes.</p>
        <p>''Feint to the left, hit to the right: your opponent never knows where you're coming from,'' Mr. Barton said. ''It's strongly his style, like a kung fu expert. He doesn't always land on his feet, but don't underestimate him.''</p>
