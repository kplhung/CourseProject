        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Health Care in Trouble'' (letter, June 29):</p>
        <p>As constructive as the letter writer's call is for using some of the anticipated budget surplus to help finance universal health care, we should first do everything we can to reduce its cost before we spend money on an expanded program.</p>
        <p>One step would be to eliminate the tax deduction for businesses providing health insurance for their employees. As an employee who receives such benefits, I find it hard to believe that a company's extensive and generous subsidization of services does not contribute to medical inflation by lessening incentives to economize.</p>
        <p>Insurance, properly defined, is meant only for events that are rare and catastrophic. Once health insurance for workers becomes proper insurance, costs can come down, and those who need it most can be more easily helped.</p>
