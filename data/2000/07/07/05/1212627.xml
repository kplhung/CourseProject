        <p>Editorial urges World Bank not to make $40 million loan to China to underwrite dam and irrigation projects in a remote part of western China and resettle 58,000 impoverished farmers in lands traditionally home to Tibetan and Mongol herders; says project poses threat to distinct Tibetan culture</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Tomorrow the World Bank's board of executive directors will consider how to proceed with a $40 million loan to China. The loan would underwrite a dam and irrigation projects in a remote part of western China and resettle 58,000 impoverished Chinese and Hui Muslim farmers in lands that have traditionally been home to Tibetans and Mongol herders. The plan would thus threaten a distinct Tibetan culture, and should be stopped.</p>
        <p>The project generated intense public criticism last year because of its environmental impacts and because the Tibetan population would be diluted by non-Tibetan settlers. The social impact is of great concern because China has in the past used similar strategies to weaken Tibetan claims of a separate culture. Dozens of environmental and human rights groups and the Clinton administration opposed financing the project.</p>

        <p>Tomorrow the World Bank's board of executive directors will consider how to proceed with a $40 million loan to China. The loan would underwrite a dam and irrigation projects in a remote part of western China and resettle 58,000 impoverished Chinese and Hui Muslim farmers in lands that have traditionally been home to Tibetans and Mongol herders. The plan would thus threaten a distinct Tibetan culture, and should be stopped.</p>
        <p>The project generated intense public criticism last year because of its environmental impacts and because the Tibetan population would be diluted by non-Tibetan settlers. The social impact is of great concern because China has in the past used similar strategies to weaken Tibetan claims of a separate culture. Dozens of environmental and human rights groups and the Clinton administration opposed financing the project.</p>
        <p>In response to the controversy, the directors delayed the loan until the bank's independent inspection panel could review various issues, including whether the bank had met its own standards for protecting the environment and indigenous peoples.</p>
        <p>The board refused to make the report public after the panel finished it. But it has since been leaked to the press and, not surprisingly, it is devastating. The panel found that the bank's management failed to consider alternatives to resettlement or other resettlement sites, and did not comply with other policy requirements, including the need to make a proper environmental analysis and create plans to preserve local cultures.</p>
        <p>The bank's president, James Wolfensohn, believes that these failures can be addressed by conducting more thorough studies on the project's impacts. But studies are not the answer. They may satisfy the bank's regulations, but they will do nothing to solve the social problems created by incursions into traditionally Tibetan lands. The bank directors would be wiser simply to reject this poorly designed project, and to invite China and the bank's management to present an alternative plan that would not require a large resettlement program in a culturally sensitive area.</p>
