        <p>People with advanced Alzheimer's disease who are hospitalized for a broken hip or pneumonia are often subjected to needless, painful medical procedures and not given enough pain medication, doctors are reporting today.</p>
        <p>Even with aggressive treatment, these patients have a high probability of dying within six months, making it more important to keep them comfortable rather than trying to cure their infections or injuries, said Dr. R. Sean Morrison and Dr. Albert L. Siu, of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Their report is being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
        <p>The study involved 216 patients who were treated for broken hips or pneumonia at Mount Sinai Hospital from September 1996 to March 1998. Of the 216 patients, 98 suffered advanced dementia; the rest did not have any form of dementia.</p>
        <p>On average, people live 10 years after a diagnosis of dementia. The condition is considered advanced when patients have trouble communicating and identifying relatives, and can no longer eat, dress, bathe or get out of bed by themselves.</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrison and Dr. Siu found that compared with the patients who were mentally intact, those who had severe dementia were far more likely to die within six months of pneumonia or a hip fracture, even with equal medical care. Only 12 percent to 13 percent of the patients without dementia died within six months, compared with 53 percent to 55 percent of those with advanced dementia. But the patients with dementia underwent as many painful and invasive procedures as the others.</p>
        <p>''These are people with a terminal diagnosis,'' said Dr. Morrison, an assistant professor of geriatrics and a specialist in palliative care, which is treatment meant to control pain and other forms of discomfort. ''But physicians and families focus on the acute illness and ignore that this is occurring in the setting of a terminal illness with an average survival of six months.''</p>
        <p>In many cases, he said, the best treatment may be to maximize pain control and minimize repeated blood tests and the insertion of intravenous lines and urinary catheters, which are painful and frightening to people with dementia. Some patients with severe dementia may even be better off without surgery to repair a broken hip.</p>
        <p>''If the patient didn't walk and is not going to walk again, it may be appropriate just to have analgesics and keep comfortable,'' Dr. Morrison said. ''We can provide them with good pain medication and get them out of the hospital and back to the living environment at home or in a nursing home where they feel safe and comfortable.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Morrison and Dr. Siu found that the patients with dementia did not receive good pain control. They were given less than half as much pain medication as the patients without dementia, even though they probably needed at least as much. Dr. Morrison said the difference might have occurred because patients with dementia could not ask for pain medicine, and doctors and nurses might not realize that they were suffering. Such patients should be given ''standing orders'' for pain medicine, he said, meaning that the drugs are given automatically whether or not the patient requests them. Only 24 percent of the patients with dementia, however, had standing orders in their charts.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ladislav Volicer, an expert on dementia and the director of geriatric research at the E. N. Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Mass., said the best solution to the problems described by Dr. Morrison might be to keep patients with dementia out of acute-care hospitals and let them stay in their homes or nursing homes, even with a broken hip or pneumonia. Hospitals are geared toward providing aggressive treatment, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Volicer said that at the Veterans Hospital dementia unit, which provides long-term care, some patients had broken hips but did not have surgery and were kept comfortable with morphine. He also said that most patients with pneumonia were not sent to the hospital and that many did not receive antibiotics, which studies have shown do not prolong life in people with advanced dementia.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stephen McConnell, a spokesman for the Alzheimer's Association, said Dr. Morrison's recommendations for better palliative care were consistent with those of the association.</p>
        <p>''It's important that people get good care,'' Dr. McConnell said, ''but the definition of that care may be different in the late stages of the disease. People with advanced dementia are near death. Good palliative care is probably going to be much more important than the standard medical treatments designed to fix people.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrison said he began the study after noticing that after a few days in the hospital, patients with dementia would flinch and shrink away from anyone who touched them.</p>
        <p>''Why?'' he asked. ''Every human touch is associated with pain or discomfort.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrison said that because patients with dementia could not understand what was being done to them they might perceive even a blood test as an assault.</p>
        <p>''You can't communicate and no one can communicate with you,'' he said. ''Somebody comes in and grabs your arm, this painful needle goes into you and you know no reason for it. It's just to make sure the numbers are right. For a terminal illness, that may not be an appropriate goal of care.''</p>
