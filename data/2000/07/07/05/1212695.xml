        <p>With the Statue of Liberty as its hazy backdrop, the replica of the freight vessel Amistad, whose cargo of rebellious slaves galvanized the abolitionist movement before the Civil War, docked at Pier A in Battery Park yesterday.</p>
        <p>Although some onlookers cheerfully snapped pictures and snatched up souvenirs from nearby vendors, a few stood solemnly with tears streaming down their faces.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of history and hardship on there,'' said Judith Hunter, 52, of Brooklyn. ''People sweated, fought and died for their freedom.''</p>
        <p>The original Amistad was on its way to New London, Conn., from Cuba in 1839 when the slaves it was carrying killed the ship's captain and chef and tried to take the vessel back to West Africa. They were captured and charged with murder.</p>
        <p>The defense team was led by former President John Quincy Adams, who argued the case before the United States Supreme Court. In March of 1841, the court ruled that the slaves had been illegally kidnapped. The 35 survivors were returned to their homeland.</p>
        <p>Warren Q. Marr II, who first had the idea of recreating the Amistad in 1976 during the first OpSail event in New York, sat just a few feet from the replica.</p>
        <p>''It's as if everyone here is sharing in my dream,'' Mr. Marr said.</p>
