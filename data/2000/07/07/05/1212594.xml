        <p>Ahamadah Ntale has a vision for a new compact between men and women in Uganda, starting with him. A few weeks ago, he walked into the local office of one of Uganda's national newspapers and left the reporter with a story that ran with this headline: ''Man hunts old woman to marry.''</p>
        <p>He is 25, a scooter taxi driver. He said he wanted a woman between 35 and 45, loving and free of AIDS. Most important, she would have to defy Uganda's tradition of men paying a dowry for their brides. The bride-to-be must cough it up to HIS parents.</p>

        <p>Ahamadah Ntale has a vision for a new compact between men and women in Uganda, starting with him. A few weeks ago, he walked into the local office of one of Uganda's national newspapers and left the reporter with a story that ran with this headline: ''Man hunts old woman to marry.''</p>
        <p>He is 25, a scooter taxi driver. He said he wanted a woman between 35 and 45, loving and free of AIDS. Most important, she would have to defy Uganda's tradition of men paying a dowry for their brides. The bride-to-be must cough it up to HIS parents.</p>
        <p>The first call came at 7 a.m. the day the article was published, from a 38-year-old businesswoman in the capital, Kampala. By nightfall, there were 193 phone calls, he said, and in the next week more than 400. One woman promised 10 cows if he chose her and gave up the search.</p>
        <p>The question is, why are women so interested in this obscure taxi driver from a small town? One answer is: because they can be.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, women in Uganda have made major strides politically and economically, more so than in many African nations. Literacy rates have shot up, and Kampala swims with middle-class working women, chatting on mobile phones and making money. The vice president of Uganda is a woman, as are several leading opposition members. The president's wife, Janet Museveni, is said to wield genuine power behind the scenes.</p>
        <p>''In Uganda, people are saying we are now equal,'' said Zebia Namugera, a 31-year-old youth counselor here. She also owns a successful shop, selling cosmetics and handbags, something she said would have been difficult even a decade ago. ''Men are now tired of doing everything,'' she said. ''We have joined them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ntale was standing in front of her, after a stroll where he was cheered on by men and women alike as something of a local hero.</p>
        <p>''As you can see,'' said Ms. Namugera, who is married, ''in fact he is handsome. That is also why women are coming.''</p>
        <p>In a nice yellow shirt and belt with a dubious Gucci label, he looked perfectly acceptable. But his offer seems the intriguing thing. Based on a few hours talking with him here, that offer combines two passions in his life: women, particularly older ones, and money. (For an interview he demanded, unsuccessfully, the equivalent of $130 or a new mobile phone.) He said, however, he is on a crusade for all men in Uganda.</p>
        <p>''I am not after having a lot of money,'' he said. ''I am trying to do this for the first time in Uganda. I need a wife to marry.''</p>
        <p>''I want to see if women could support me, as men have always supported women after we have married them,'' he added. ''I want to experience the way they treat us after marrying us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ntale is the second child of his father's third wife. His father, a Muslim, has 5 wives and 23 children. Every so often when Mr. Ntale was growing up, one of his sisters would disappear with a strange man.</p>
        <p>''So I said to my mother one time: 'Why do they take my sisters?' '' he said in Luganda, the language of the largest tribe in Uganda. ''She said to me, 'They take them to get married and when they marry the men have to pay something.' ''</p>
        <p>''I asked one time, 'Why don't they take us, the men?' '' he said. ''She replied to me, 'The men pay for the women, not the women for the men.' ''</p>
        <p>The contradiction stuck with him. Five years ago, he joined a local drama club and composed a song about the virtues of marriage. ''When I was singing it in concert I saw that the women were very much interested in this song,'' he said. ''The ladies were so happy and would come and give me money. When you praise a woman she begins to change and be very happy.''</p>
        <p>And particularly he sings the praises of older women.</p>
        <p>''During my childhood, I used to think that older women were the best,'' he said. ''They know what love is. They comfort you and come for you, unlike younger women who will jump and go to other men.''</p>
        <p>He said he is now the oldest of his friends not to be married (though he has fathered four children). He recently decided it was time, and on June 8 went to see Rogers Mulindwa, the local bureau chief for The Monitor, to get his courtship going.</p>
        <p>''In the beginning I thought that he was joking,'' said Mr. Mulindwa, who clearly knows a good story. ''But he stayed here for over two hours. He proved to me that he was serious.''</p>
        <p>The story ran eight days later, with the mobile-phone number of one of Mr. Ntale's neighbors. The first call came when Mr. Ntale was still asleep, and the calls, logged by name in a book, have not stopped. The youngest caller was 27 years old, the oldest 60. (They actually had lunch together but he disqualified her because she is possibly a relative.) Several women have driven here, about 30 miles north of Kampala, one in a Land Rover and another in a nice Toyota.</p>
        <p>Apart from the cows, he will not discuss what he has been offered. He has no idea how this will all end. His pick will have to pay the dowry, though he said she would not necessarily be the highest bidder.</p>
        <p>''I am not after some rich woman,'' he said. ''I've seen a lot of rich women but they were not my choice. She needs to love me very much.''</p>
        <p>In his small town, he said, he had not been mocked -- as when he sang his marriage song five years ago --  but congratulated by men and women alike. Dozens of men have begged him to send any extra women willing to pay dowries their way, among them Christopher Senkumba, 35, also an unmarried scooter taximan.</p>
        <p>''I have asked several times but so far he has not sent any,'' Mr. Senkumba said. ''Even if it was you, you would be so angry about that.''</p>
        <p>A local Muslim elder, Ahamadah Matovu, said he thought Mr. Ntale's initiative was excellent, though he must love her and the marriage must be strictly religious.</p>
        <p>''The woman must be willing to have only one man,'' he said. Asked if Mr. Ntale would have to confine himself to only one woman, Mr. Matovu gave a practical answer, though not in line with the current thinking about sex equality: ''He is limited by his finances. I don't think he has much money.''</p>
        <p>One woman, Lukiya Narwoga, 50, seemed amused by the idea, though she said it demeaned the woman. ''It is like a prostitute going to a man, selling herself,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Ntale himself, she looked him over, up and down, in front of her shop.</p>
        <p>''I can't take him,'' she said. ''He's not my size -- too young. But this boy is handsome.''</p>
