        <p>NO wine rode a bigger crest of popularity in the 1990's than merlot. It's no surprise, then, that merlot is now grown all over the world, as producers everywhere hope to get in on the action.</p>
        <p>For all its popularity, though, merlot is a curious case. It makes serious, wonderful wines, which reach luscious and expensive  heights in St.-Emilion and especially Pomerol, areas of Bordeaux where merlot is a dominant grape. Yet, it also makes boring and insipid wines, especially in California. And while these wines have nonetheless proved popular, they have received regular whippings from critics, prompting some wine drinkers to turn up their noses at the mere mention of merlot.</p>
        <p>Let's be clear. Many merlots, even French ones, are plain bad: weedy, vegetal and hollow. Some are good, even in California, where the best examples either follow the Bordeaux model, with an elegant balance of fruit, tannin and acidity, or are made in the more typical California style, full of sweet fruit.</p>
        <p>Long Island, which has been promoted as a future merlot hotbed, likewise makes some good merlots, but more uninteresting ones. Unlike the French, who have had centuries to ponder how best to plant the grapes, Long Island vintners are fairly new to  merlot, so a certain amount of experimentation is to be expected for a few years at least.</p>
        <p>Of the dozen or so Long Island merlots I tasted, the Pellegrini stood out for its balance and structure.</p>
        <p>Unlike many merlots, which can be so soft they are practically squishy, the Pellegrini had the tannins to stand up to the fruit. It is not the most approachable wine, but in the long run it was easily the most pleasing.</p>
        <p>PELLEGRINI VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1996: $18  Well structured, excellent balance between fruit and tannins.</p>
        <p>. . .  SCHNEIDER, NORTH FORK, 1997: $24  Aromas of smoky herbs and plums, with a long sweet finish.</p>
        <p>. . .  BEDELL CELLARS, NORTH FORK, 1995: $17  Smooth textured and medium bodied, soft but nicely flavored.</p>
        <p>. . .  LAUREL LAKE VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1996: $16  Fruity and ripe, with a little chocolate mixed in, but very soft.</p>
        <p>. . .  DUCK WALK VINEYARDS, NORTH FORK, 1997: $20  Aromas of chocolate and bell pepper, earthy flavors and a nice finish.</p>
        <p>. . .  HARGRAVE, NORTH FORK, 1998: $18  Light bodied, anise and bell pepper flavors balancing out the fruit.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
