        <p>It has become a rite of summer for Mike Piazza. The results of the All-Star balloting are announced, and Piazza has more votes than any other National League catcher.

        <p>It has become a rite of summer for Mike Piazza. The results of the All-Star balloting are announced, and Piazza has more votes than any other National League catcher. The fans have voted him to the All-Star team seven years in a row, and this year made him the league's leading vote-getter.</p>
        <p>Piazza's teammate Edgardo Alfonzo was leading in the balloting at second base on Friday, poised to be an All-Star for the first time. Alfonzo might still make it, but he will have to do so as a reserve. The San Francisco Giants' Jeff Kent, a former Met, surged ahead of Alfonzo and Houston's Craig Biggio and will be the starter.</p>
        <p>''You want Fonzie to be recognized,'' Piazza said of his teammate, ''but he's such a well-kept secret for us in so many ways. He's just got a really cool vibe going there. But he deserves every bit of recognition that he has coming -- and he's got a lot coming.''</p>
        <p>Kent, who is leading the league in runs batted in with 80, received 1,018,430 votes, about 55,000 more than Biggio and 145,000 more than Alfonzo. He is one of four players who were voted to the team for the first time this year, joining American League outfielders Bernie Williams of the Yankees and Jermaine Dye of Kansas City, and first baseman Jason Giambi of Oakland.</p>
        <p>Williams, who is batting .331 with 18 homers and 77 R.B.I., was selected as an All-Star reserve in each of the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was a good choice,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. ''It was great to have Griffey go to the other league and Bernie lead all outfielders in votes.''</p>
        <p>Williams was the leading vote-getter among A.L. outfielders, a distinction that had usually been Ken Griffey Jr.'s before his trade from Seattle to Cincinnati before the season.</p>
        <p>Griffey had been the leading vote-getter in the American League each of the last four seasons, and five times over all. Griffey started off slowly this season, but he batted over .300 in June and is among the National League leaders with 26 home runs. He finished first in the balloting among N.L. outfielders.</p>
        <p>Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez led all major leaguers with 2,808,456 votes. Piazza led the National League players with 2,780,452 votes, over two million more than Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall, the runner-up. It was the third time in his career -- and first time as a Met -- that Piazza has been the leading N.L. vote-getter. ''It never gets old,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo, who is batting .333 with 13 homers and 57 R.B.I., was second to Biggio when in-stadium balloting ended early last week, but received a boost from online voters. That proved to Alfonzo that more fans were noticing him, and that is a great feeling, he said. But he knew Kent could pull ahead; he said he sees Kent's highlights on television all the time. ''I know it was real close and I'm kind of a little disappointed, but I think I did everything,'' Alfonzo said. ''I just put everything all together. There's a lot of competition at second base. We'll see what's going to happen next.''</p>
        <p>Atlanta Braves Manager Bobby Cox, who must choose from a cluster of talented second basemen including Florida's Luis Castillo and Montreal's Jose Vidro, has said that he would consider selecting Alfonzo as a backup at another position, like third base. ''I could play anywhere,'' Alfonzo said. ''If he wants me to play third base, second base, shortstop, catcher, whatever. I'll be prepared for it, no problem.''</p>
        <p>The Yanks' Derek Jeter finished second to Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, his good friend, after being the runner-up to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra last year. Torre picks the American League reserves, and Jeter is one of several Yankees likely to be named to the team. The closer Mariano Rivera and catcher Jorge Posada are also strong candidates.</p>
        <p>Torre also could select Toronto's David Wells as the starting pitcher for the game, which will be played at Turner Field in Atlanta next Tuesday. Wells, who sometimes clashed with Torre when he pitched for the Yankees from 1997-98, is 14-2 this year. Boston's Pedro Martinez is having the best season among A.L. starters, but is on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>Mets starter Al Leiter is 10-1 with a 3.04 earned run average and will almost certainly be selected. The closer Armando Benitez, who is third in the National League with 18 saves and who has a 1.19 E.R.A. since May 6, also has a chance.</p>
        <p>The voting for National League second baseman was not the closest at any position. Cleveland's Manny Ramirez won the third and final outfield spot by fewer than 30,000 votes over Boston's Carl Everett.</p>
        <p>Joining Ivan and Alex Rodriguez, Giambi, Williams, Dye and Ramirez as American League starters are second baseman Roberto Alomar of Cleveland and third baseman Cal Ripken of Baltimore. Ripken is an 18-time All-Star who has been elected to the team every year since 1984, except in 1988.</p>
        <p>In addition to Piazza, Kent and Griffey, National League starters include first baseman Mark McGwire of St. Louis, third baseman Chipper Jones of Atlanta, shortstop Barry Larkin of Cincinnati and outfielders Barry Bonds of San Francisco and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs.</p>
