        <p>More students than ever before are enrolled in school this summer as districts throughout the country, led by those in major cities, require or strongly urge younger and younger students to attend classes to shore up basic reading and mathematical skills.</p>
        <p>About 1 in 5 students in the nation's 53 largest urban districts will be attending school this month, with some places, notably Chicago, Miami and St. Louis, keeping more than 40 percent of pupils in class during what was once vacation.</p>
        <p>Other districts have increased attendance markedly in recent years, adding programs in both remediation and enrichment: Cleveland's enrollment jumped to 18,000 students this summer from just 1,000 in 1998; New Orleans has 11,000 students this summer, up from about 500 in 1995; and Boston expected about 12,000, up from 2,800 five years ago. In New York, about 260,000 students are expected to attend summer school in a program started primarily to end automatic promotion. [Article, Page B1.]</p>
        <p>Several school districts begin classes today, with most sessions lasting about five weeks.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on summer school is a byproduct of the national movement to raise academic performance, improve scores on standardized tests and end automatic promotion based on age rather than achievement.</p>
        <p>But as educators try to bridge the yawning achievement gaps between poor minority students and white middle-class ones, some are worried that the summer programs -- many of which are mandatory for students who fail to meet promotion requirements -- will simply repeat ineffective teaching approaches and frustrate children with endless drills for high-stakes exams.</p>
        <p>Other educators fear that the safety net of summer school will let teachers and administrators off the hook for problems during the year.</p>
        <p>''If kids need additional time, they need additional time, but they also need, during the September-to-June period, good teachers and good curriculum,'' said Amy T. Wilkins of the Education Trust, a Washington organization focused on equity between students of different races and classes. ''A little summer school thrown on top is not going to make up for the deficiencies in either of those things.''</p>
        <p>Summer school had long been seen as a dreaded lock-up for teenagers who failed chemistry or skipped too many gym classes. While high school students still use the summer to make up credits needed for graduation, the enormous expansion is focused on students as young as kindergarten, the curriculum a mix heavy in test-preparation seminars for remedial students but which includes day-camp substitutes.</p>
        <p>Research has documented a ''summer slide'' in which children, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, forget study skills, discipline habits and vocabulary words between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Educators are eager for the extra class hours, while many parents who work full-time, particularly in low-income families, consider summer school a safe productive alternative to weeks spent idly watching television or roaming city streets.</p>
        <p>The growth of summer school also reflected increased concerns that the United States' school calendar -- which falls short of the more than 200 days required by Japan, Korea, Germany and Israel, never mind China's 250 -- is insufficient.</p>
        <p>''This notion of a 180-day school year is really obsolete,'' said Judith Johnson, deputy assistant secretary of the federal Department of Education.</p>
        <p>''We need to stop thinking about summer school as an activity separate from the regular school year,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''All children do not learn in the same way, nor do all of them learn along the same developmental timelines.''</p>
        <p>There are no current estimates on the number of students in summer school, but most educators agree it has risen substantially from the 9 percent who attended in 1996. An informal telephone survey by The New York Times found some 1.3 million students scheduled for classes in 53 major districts whose total enrollment is 6.9 million (there are about 52 million students overall).</p>
        <p>Though the phenomenon is growing in suburbs as well as cities, it is most prevalent in low-income areas; in 1998, 27 percent of all districts, but 52 percent of those with large numbers of poor pupils, offered summer school.</p>
        <p>''For many of our kids, they're city kids, and sometimes their opportunities are not so many,'' said Patrick Bryan, a summer school principal at Dayton Bluffs Elementary School in St. Paul. ''It would be a long, dry summer if they did not have summer school.''</p>
        <p>Led by Chicago in 1996 and New York last summer, more and more cities and states require students to attend summer classes or risk being held back. Fourteen states have enacted legislation expanding summer school requirements, and 24 of the 53 districts contacted by The Times have mandatory attendance for some students.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, third graders who do not meet promotion standards must attend summer school in order to move on. Washington, D.C., requires all students with low scores on standardized tests to participate in its 3-year-old ''Summer Stars'' program, and to pass a test at the end of the session to be promoted. Administrators in Boston, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles and New Orleans all order struggling students in benchmark grades to attend summer classes, though they cannot make them show up (Detroit expected 36,000 in its program and ended up with 25,000).</p>
        <p>''They have to be motivated to be here,'' said Linda Miller, who teaches an intensive reading and math class at Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., part of the school district in Broward County, which requires summer school for those who fail the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests.</p>
        <p>''Those who stay, stay because they want to,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Janicia Jackson, 15, a student at Douglas High, said she benefits from studying the same subject for four hours each day.</p>
        <p>''I understand things a lot better the second time around,'' Ms. Jackson said. ''All this information is floating around the back of my head, but being in summer school brings it out.''</p>
        <p>In Anchorage, 7-year-old Adrian Ramos, who speaks Spanish at home and was enrolled in a Japanese immersion program, is spending summer school studying English.</p>
        <p>''He heard me on the phone trying to enroll him, and he said he didn't want to go,'' Adrian's mother, Yadira Ramos, said. ''But yesterday, as soon as he got out, he told me he really likes being in summer school.''</p>
        <p>A survey of the nation's 100 largest school districts by Geoffrey D. Borman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, found that 59 percent offer summer school as an alternative to social promotion, and 55 percent are using the extra weeks to help students meet more challenging state and local standards. Only 16 percent said the aim was enrichment, and just 1 percent of the programs were intended to address summer learning losses.</p>
        <p>But even as they develop summer classes focused on math and language, with an eye toward the tests that students failed before arriving, many districts are searching for innovative curriculums to keep students engaged and motivated.</p>
        <p>Minneapolis offers 73 courses, including ''Real and Alternate Histories of World War II.'' In Fort Worth, multi-age classrooms of elementary students tackle topics including ''Bubbleology'' and ''Tool Time for Girls.''</p>
        <p>At Macario Garcia Elementary School in Houston, students learn about the digestive system and body temperature by working at a mock hospital. ''Science can be dry and boring,'' the school principal, Adriana Castro, said. ''All these lessons are designed to be hands-on.''</p>
        <p>Several years ago in Newark, summer school was essentially a repeat  of the previous year's lessons.</p>
        <p>''If they didn't get it the first time, we were trying to teach them the same way the second time around, and it didn't work,'' Jerry Bruno, a district administrator, said.</p>
        <p>Now, reading, math and science are filtered through thematic units: first graders and second graders  study sunlight and shadows, while third graders through fifth graders examine rain forests and weather and middle school students study robotics.</p>
        <p>''It's all new material that the kids are exposed to during the summer,'' Mr. Bruno said.</p>
        <p>As districts have expanded summer programs, they have faced a new set of problems, from students sweltering in buildings without air conditioning to a lack of money for transportation or a dearth of teachers. Some problems have been administrative. In New York last year, thousands of students were wrongly forced to enroll in summer school because of test scores that turned out to have been improperly reported.</p>
        <p>Effectiveness is also unclear: In Chicago last year, nearly half of those required to attend summer school failed to meet the district's promotion requirements. Seattle abandoned its ''academic boot camp'' for 500 fifth graders after the summer of 1998 because only a few improved enough to go on to sixth grade.</p>
        <p>Harris Cooper, author of the study ''Making the Most of Summer School''(Blackwell Publishing, May 2000), said small classes, good teachers, parental involvement and rigorous evaluation are crucial. Middle-class students, whose summers often included other educational activities, tended to benefit more from summer school than low-income children, according to Mr. Cooper's study, but over all, 85 percent of the students who attended outperformed peers who did not.</p>
        <p>''Kids are learning all year long,'' said Mr. Cooper, chairman of the psychology department at the University of Missouri. ''They're learning every day. The question is, really, what is it that they're learning?''</p>
        <p>Karl L. Alexander, a Johns Hopkins sociologist who has been following a group of Baltimore schoolchildren since 1982, said tests taken each spring and fall have shown that low-income children kept pace with their better-off peers during the year, but  stagnated during the summer.</p>
        <p>''In upper-income families, they more often go to the library during the summer, they more often go on summer vacations, they more often attend summer camps -- and there's more reading material in the household, more of them have computers,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''The summer period is a chunk of time, and it's like a black box. What you drop into it is really important.''</p>
        <p>To that end, Ms. Johnson recently ran a summer program in White Plains that wrapped a basic skills curriculum around field trips and speakers, and even included tennis lessons. ''If I could have taken them to the opera, I would have taken them to the opera,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Concerns over ''summer slide'' and other worries about the calendar have nourished a separate movement to extend the school year in the United States beyond 180 days. Dozens of schools and districts are adding days, while others run classes year-round, typically with vacations of three or four weeks every few months.</p>
        <p>Charles Ballinger, director of the National Association for Year-Round Education, said nearly 3,000 schools in 43 states, serving more than 2 million students, have year-round classes, compared with 411 schools and 354,087 students in the 1985-86 school year.</p>
        <p>''By reducing the vacation, obviously you reduce the chance of forgetting to occur,'' Mr. Ballinger said. ''If students learn anything on a given day, one has to make the assumption that more days would allow more learning.''</p>
