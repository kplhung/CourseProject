        <p>For Bertha Robinson, the wind went right out of her Independence Day celebration around noon yesterday, when the small ships with their billowing sails began slowly passing her apartment at 150th Street and Riverside Drive. First came three, then three more, up the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>But that was it.</p>
        <p>The two dozen friends who had gathered in Ms. Robinson's seventh-floor apartment craned their necks to look for the armada of sailing ships that they had heard about on television and in newspapers for the last week. No leviathans of war. No majestic frigates in orderly line. Just some motor-driven Coast Guard patrol boats.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like you have ringside seats to a championship bout or a Knicks game, and the game just doesn't happen,'' Ms. Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robinson was one of thousands of spectators uptown and in New Jersey feeling left at the dock yesterday when most of the 180 tall ships in the OpSail flotilla turned around at Pier 94, near 54th Street, and sailed back down the Hudson to their berths. United States Coast Guard officials said Operation Sail, the organization putting on the Parade of Sail, had planned all along to have the boats turn around there. But obviously there was some confusion in the process of getting that word to the spectators, who had heard for more than a week that the entire parade would go up to the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>''The smaller ships did go up to the bridge, but the bigger ships turned around,'' said Petty Officer Third Class Tom Sperduto, a Coast Guard spokesman. ''The parade route has been set for a while, and nothing had changed.''</p>
        <p>But on the Coast Guard's Web site, a link to an events calendar described OpSail as a ''16 mile parade from Verrazano Bridge to George Washington Bridge.'' It does not mention any plan for the ships to turn around far short of the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sperduto said he did not know how many tall ships continued up to the bridge, but witnesses said only about a half-dozen made it that far. Irate spectators were calling the Coast Guard yesterday afternoon. At Operation Sail's Manhattan headquarters, calls seeking comment were not answered.</p>
        <p>In Riverside Park near 93rd Street, where baby strollers and Zabar's bags abounded, rumors of the reversal began circulating shortly before noon. The spectators, some carrying flags, some reading the Declaration of Independence in a newspaper, had been watching specks on the horizon for an hour. In the muggy, still air, the ships almost appeared stationary, said Michael Dolan.</p>
        <p>''When you first saw the ships, there was this hope of these ships coming up, but it didn't seem like they were making any progress,'' he said. ''They were ghost ships.''</p>
        <p>For many people, the air show almost saved the day. The stealth bomber, a black triangle that looked like something out of the ''X Files,'' drew gasps of awe up and down the river.</p>
        <p>That was little consolation for many tourists who had trekked from far and wide to see the Parade of Sail. Jack Anderson, who had driven about 700 miles from Newbury, Vt., was standing at Grant's Tomb, at 122nd Street in Riverside Park, when he saw the sails down the Hudson turn to the side, then recede into the gray haze.</p>
        <p>''What's their excuse?'' he said. ''They can go around the world, but they can't see the George Washington Bridge up there?''</p>
