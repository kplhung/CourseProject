        <p>With its squeaky wooden floor, cement-block walls and stalwart basketball hoops, the gymnasium at Sunrise Drive Elementary School has barely changed since the school was built four decades ago. But physical education has changed a lot.</p>
        <p>Signs posted around the gym remind students that they have entered a ''no-fault zone'' where they are allowed to make mistakes, and that ''if you had fun, you won.'' One corner has been labeled ''Our Friendship and Kindness Circle,'' with cutouts of teddy bears, hearts and children holding hands.</p>
        <p>Students here no longer pick their own teams for ball games -- egos are too easily wounded that way. Dodge ball, a gym class favorite for decades, was banned a few years ago because it was too confrontational and, for many children, too demoralizing.</p>
        <p>And these days, students at Sunrise Drive not only exercise but write about the experiences in fitness journals. There are two objectives: expressing their feelings about various sports and explaining how each makes them more physically fit.</p>
        <p>Here, as in many elementary schools around the country, the emphasis is increasingly on cooperation, not competition. Joanne Hamilton, the gym teacher at Sunrise Drive since 1982, said the idea was to nurture children's self-esteem and teach them more about how to keep healthy than how to play team sports. The fewer discouraging experiences students have in gym class, she said,  the more likely they are to continue exercising for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p>''No one ever gets their feelings hurt in my class,'' said Miss Hamilton, thin and no-nonsense in khaki shorts and a tucked-in T-shirt, as a class of second graders skittered around the gym the other day. ''Because once you turn a kid off to movement, they are never going to move again.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Judith Young, executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, said physical education classes were focusing more on cooperative activities because they allow even the least athletic students to play important roles.</p>
        <p>''We've learned that it's good to blend together our different talents to achieve a goal,'' Dr. Young said. ''That means including someone who might not be as strong or fast, but has another strength that can contribute to our common cause.''</p>
        <p>One way that Miss Hamilton keeps her students enthusiastic is to avoid elimination games, much less let them strike out. In baseball, instead of switching roles after three outs, each team gets 10 minutes at bat, then 10 minutes in the field. Players may choose between having the ball pitched to them or hitting it off a tee.</p>
        <p>And in Miss Hamilton's version of tag, boys and girls alike pretend they are fairies and skip around the gym with fluttering arms. (It should be noted, however, that not a few boys stopped fluttering their arms almost immediately in one recent game.)</p>
        <p>Players who are ''it'' can tag their classmates, but the children who are caught are not necessarily out of the game. They can escape from captivity by shouting to other players, ''Free me!''</p>
        <p>But if gym class is kinder and gentler these days, it is also more goal-oriented. The standards movement that has swept the nation in recent years, while focused mostly on academic subjects, has led many states to adopt physical education standards for each level, too.</p>
        <p>New York's standards require students to ''demonstrate mastery of fundamental motor, nonlocomotor and manipulative skills'' and ''demonstrate and assess their fitness by performing exercises and activities related to each health-related fitness component.''</p>
        <p>Because of the new standards, students at Sunrise Drive learn the difference between muscular strength (''being able to lift our books up'') and muscular endurance (''being able to carry them home''). They get homework questions about upper body strength, for example, and volleyball terminology. And in their fitness journals, they explain how different physical activities keep them in shape and, in some cases, foster cooperation.</p>
        <p>''Today I built a new pond in my backyard,'' Greg Dowdy, a fourth grader, wrote in his journal. ''It was tough but all of my cousins and friends helped. It related to gym because it was tough work, just like running miles.''</p>
        <p>The journals also give students an opportunity to vent about their gym class frustrations. Lauren Gajewski, a fifth grader, confided that she was relieved when she failed to hit the ball in a recent softball game because ''I didn't have to worry about what to do if I got to first base.'' And Jacklyn Spaeth, also in fifth grade, complained in her journal that students who are caught during tag pretend to be still free. ''That's when you know a fight is going to begin,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>In grading the journals, Miss Hamilton has been known to offer therapeutic advice. ''During tag you can always resolve the conflict with rock-paper-scissors,'' she wrote to Jacklyn.</p>
        <p>And instead of scolding raucous students with a shrill whistle, Miss Hamilton uses carefully chosen language to make students reflect on what is now known as inappropriate behavior.</p>
        <p>''Greg, that wasn't a good choice to make, to throw that ball in Lissa's face,'' she said calmly to a first grader. ''You owe her an apology.''</p>
        <p>But while the new physical education curriculum at Sunrise Drive and other elementary schools is supposed to make gym class more entertaining and inclusive, it is still not hard to find students who complain about it. Jessica Geraci, a fifth grader, admitted one day that she much preferred art class, which Sunrise Drive students take only once a week compared with three times a week for gym.</p>
        <p>''I'm not very good at some of the things we have to do,'' Jessica said, adding that volleyball was particularly nerve-racking. ''If you miss getting the ball you feel bad and you feel like you ruined the whole game.''</p>
        <p>But Miss Hamilton said the pressure to perform was much worse in the community leagues for soccer, softball and lacrosse that many suburban children are joining. ''I can't complain too much about the leagues because they get all kinds of kids out there playing,'' she said. ''But I hate to see these coaches putting down children who aren't skilled.''</p>
        <p>There were no such put-downs at Sunrise Drive's annual field day in June -- an event that,  not surprisingly, has been renamed Fun Day. None of the games were competitive, and each student was given a ribbon. Instead of ''First Place'' or ''Second Place,'' the ribbons were printed with ''Everybody's a Winner'' and ''It's Great to Participate.''</p>
        <p>There was a partner tire roll, in which students paired up to push a tire down the field. The point was not to beat other teams, but to cooperate with your partner and see how many times you could race back and forth in 10 minutes. Students also played ''nonthreatening volleyball,'' so named because there were no fixed teams.</p>
        <p>''The object is to accept everyone and their abilities,'' Miss Hamilton said. ''As long as they do their best with their God-given talents and are kind, caring little people, they win.''</p>
