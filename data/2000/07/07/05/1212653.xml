        <p>An odd coalition of idealists and entrepreneurs, ranging from the novelist Toni Morrison to a powerful Westchester County developer, has a vision.

        <p>An odd coalition of idealists and entrepreneurs, ranging from the novelist Toni Morrison to a powerful Westchester County developer, has a vision. The goal is to turn this tattered village with a whopping view of the Hudson River into the next Piermont or Nyack or Cold Spring -- Hudson Valley towns that draw throngs of well-heeled tourists in search of small-town charm and inessentials like potted topiaries and pumpkin butter.</p>
        <p>But Haverstraw needs more than a nip and a tuck. The 2.2-square-mile village in Rockland County, once a thriving river town and the self-proclaimed brick-making capital of the world, went into a steep decline after the emergence of skyscrapers killed the demand for brick. There are now far more bodegas than boutiques, and many of the Hispanic residents, who make up more than 60 percent of the population of about 9,400, are poorly housed and underemployed.</p>
        <p>No matter, says the mayor, Francis  Wassmer, known as Bud, a former marine with a can-do attitude and a sentimental belief in his native village. If Haverstraw is ever going to dust itself off, it is now, he argues, given the humming regional economy, the sudden availability of all two miles of the village's once-industrial riverfront and the growing allure of the Hudson Valley as a tourism destination.</p>
        <p>But the village's plans raise an intriguing question. How many Hudson Valley towns can be reinvented as antique-and-boutique zones for the well-to-do, and does that redevelopment have to come at the expense of the lower-income people already there?</p>
        <p>Like Peekskill, N.Y., which actually advertised for artists, and Piermont, N.Y., which evolved more naturally, Haverstraw is pursuing an idiosyncratic strategy of economic development, putting artists, antiques and boutiques front and center. ''Just as the Renaissance led Europe out of the Dark Ages, the arts are going to be a big part of the revitalization of our village,'' Mayor Wassmer said with characteristic bravado.</p>
        <p>But some Latino residents are uneasy. They worry about being displaced if property values rise. And they wonder whether they will feel alienated by stores like the recently opened Jacqueline's Treasure Chest, which sells $4 cookie cutters in the shape of teapots and $6.25 bags of English scone mix. ''We hear rumors that when they fix everything up, they won't want us here,'' said Delsa Hilario, a hair stylist born in the Dominican Republic who has called Haverstraw home for 30 years.</p>
        <p>While other towns have deployed artists and antiques dealers with mixed results, there are signs that Haverstraw, despite its grittiness, might at least be on the verge of attracting them.</p>
        <p>Martin Ginsburg, a prominent Westchester County developer chosen by the village to redo the waterfront, has all but persuaded the Hudson Valley Children's Museum to abandon Nyack in favor of a riverside perch at the foot of Main Street  where he wants to build 850 apartments. Mr. Ginsburg has teamed up with a local developer to renovate an old five-and-dime building, with antiques shops and artists' studios. And he is working with New York Waterway and Metro-North Railroad on a ferry service, scheduled to begin in late August, to lure Westchester's thick wallets from the opposite bank.</p>
        <p>Mayor Wassmer and his wife have just opened an antiques store, the Captain's Chest, to ''lead the way,'' as he put it, though, in truth, the merchandise looks more second-hand than antique.</p>
        <p>In perhaps the biggest coup, Ms. Morrison, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and Nobel laureate, is renovating a 19th-century fixer-upper on the river with the intention of renting out apartments to artists. A resident of the affluent village of Grand View in southern Rockland, Ms. Morrison, who declined to be interviewed, has said she was attracted by Haverstraw's ethnic and racial diversity and wanted to make a financial commitment to the arts.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the village, about 30 miles north of Manhattan, has laid the groundwork for a rebirth. There was a successful assault on crime, as well as facade improvements and new parking spaces. A few professionals priced out of other towns have trickled in, restoring historic houses, and an Italian restaurant called Civile's, where lunch for two can top $100, opened on the river's edge in 1998. ''The immediate area is not ready for me,'' conceded Tom Civile, the owner. ''But everything's moving in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>Those rumblings attracted the notice of the Ginsburg Development Corporation of Hawthorne, N.Y. The company is assembling 40 acres  along the river, from the site of a former ready-mix concrete plant to land belonging to a defunct fuel oil company. The $150 million project, which must undergo a lengthy environmental review, will consist mostly of rental apartments and will include a public promenade running the length of three peninsulas.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether the potted-topiary set will take to a place with a strong Latino flavor and hints of hard times. In the small downtown, restaurants wear hand-painted signs, salsa music drifts from car radios and a check-cashing outlet occupies prime real estate.</p>
        <p>''Some folks like their suburban ghetto where everyone makes $200,000 a year and is white and goes to church,'' said Robert F. Bristol, president of Saratoga Associates, a planning firm that has advised numerous towns on revitalization efforts. ''But if the village can capitalize on the quality aspects of that cultural mix, it shouldn't be an impediment.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mayor Wassmer, whose relationship with Hispanic residents has not been entirely harmonious, says Latino food and culture will be ''part of the attraction.'' But some Hispanic leaders say they ought to be the main attraction. They would prefer a row of restaurants representing the cuisines of Latin  America, along with Latino music clubs and shops typical of San Juan and Mexico City.</p>
        <p>''Why not develop it with a Latin theme?'' asked Edna I. Rivera, executive director of Housing Opportunities for Growth, Advancement and Revitalization, or Hogar, a nonprofit group in Haverstraw. ''I'm a firm believer that if revitalization happens, it must begin from within. Otherwise, it's gentrification.''</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Rivera, Hector A. May, an investment banker who is chairman of HOGAR, says residents have not been properly informed of a plan that could change their lives. ''I don't believe the mayor is anti-Hispanic or racist, but he has a military, Marine-Corps mentality,'' Mr. May said. ''His attitude is that he's in charge and he will share his plan on a need-to-know basis.''</p>
        <p>The proposed housing is planned for a vacant industrial wasteland, and village officials say displacement is therefore not a concern. But critics fear that property values in the rest of the village could soar, driving up rents and raising taxes for homeowners who will shoulder the cost of additional services. (Estimates of the number of Hispanic residents who own their own homes range from 40 percent to 60 percent.)</p>
        <p>The mayor argues that a bustling commercial district will mean more jobs for residents, and the developer has pledged to create at least 85 units of below-market housing. But Mr. May insists the village needs twice that amount. ''There are people living in basements and abandoned cars here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>More than anything, the village wants to take advantage of the increased interest in the Hudson Valley, a six-county region north of New York City that draws 25 million people a year. Between 1988 and 1998, hotel, inn and bed-and-breakfast revenues jumped to $301 million from $178 million. More and more, tourists are coming from as far away as  Britain and Europe to witness the landscape made famous by the Hudson River School of painting and to visit the valley's many historic sites, artisan food producers, wineries and tucked-away villages offering the antithesis of a mall experience.</p>
        <p>The Putnam County village of Cold Spring, with its 19th-century streetscape overlooking the river, now has 50 boutiques and antique shops along a half mile stretch of Main Street. It  draws 2,000 visitors a day on a sunny weekend. In Rockland County, the one-square-mile village of Nyack, which has a racially diverse population, has grown steadily over the years. Starting out as an antique junction, the village is now known as much for its night life, with 21 restaurants at last count.</p>
        <p>But other towns in the Hudson Valley that have tried to reinvent themselves as antiques-and-arts meccas offer cautionary lessons.</p>
        <p>In Peekskill, N.Y., a racially diverse city in northern Westchester, local officials set out in the early 1990's to recruit artists to loft spaces by placing advertisements in The Village Voice. They got artists all right. But they did not spark a downtown revival. Instead, they started acting up at City Council meetings, where they objected to video surveillance cameras in town and refused to adhere to strict speaking guidelines. In last fall's elections, artists helped sweep in a new council.</p>
        <p>In southern Rockland County, the village of Piermont saw its identity change after a paper mill on the Hudson River shut down in the late 1970's. In the 1980's, a critically acclaimed restaurant, Xavier's, opened in the tiny business district, along with antiques shops and arty boutiques.</p>
        <p>Then a big developer swooped down to capitalize on the energy, proposing a large condominium complex on the Hudson River. After a bankruptcy and a change of ownership, the 327-unit development is almost complete. The mayor, Dennis W. Hardy, who lives in the complex, calls Piermont's transformation a ''success story.''</p>
        <p>But others are less sanguine. They say something was lost when the simple street of quirky shops was transformed into a ''condo village.'' On weekends, traffic is snarled. Village taxes, which spiked 30 percent in a two-year period in the mid-1990's, have since moderated, but school taxes continue to climb.</p>
        <p>''This development came so quickly and wasn't integrated into the fabric of the village,'' said a village employee who requested anonymity. ''It hasn't been the golden egg that everybody thought it would be.''</p>
        <p>In Haverstraw, village officials do not seem discouraged by the mixed results elsewhere. ''We were the dregs of society before,'' said Angelo J. Cintron, a village trustee active in  Hispanic life there. ''We can't go back to where we were. If I thought Latinos were going to be driven out, I wouldn't support the plan.''</p>
        <p>As he finished a three-course lunch at Civile's, the jovial mayor turned suddenly solemn. ''If I died tomorrow, and there was only one line written on my tombstone,'' Mr. Wassmer said, ''it would be that 'He saved this village.' ''</p>
