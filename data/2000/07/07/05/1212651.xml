        <p>Under a steamy cloud-bound sky, one of the largest gatherings of seagoing vessels since man first lashed a cut of canvas to a mast cruised majestically across the watery parade ground of New York Harbor yesterday in a tribute to America's 224th year of independence.</p>
        <p>A stately march of 26 tall ships, hulls humming and sails rippling, led an 11-mile procession of 300 military vessels from nearly 20 nations. They moved through the harbor and up the Hudson River in a five-hour wind-blown ballet witnessed by thousands aboard bobbing pleasure craft and more than one million on shore.</p>

        <p>Under a steamy cloud-bound sky, one of the largest gatherings of seagoing vessels since man first lashed a cut of canvas to a mast cruised majestically across the watery parade ground of New York Harbor yesterday in a tribute to America's 224th year of independence.</p>
        <p>A stately march of 26 tall ships, hulls humming and sails rippling, led an 11-mile procession of 300 military vessels from nearly 20 nations. They moved through the harbor and up the Hudson River in a five-hour wind-blown ballet witnessed by thousands aboard bobbing pleasure craft and more than one million on shore.</p>
        <p>It was a splendid maritime collage. There were teak-decked schooners daubed with sailors in spanking whites, gray swells heaving brown-masted barks into yellow skies. There were bowsprits slicing through ocher haze, jibtops whipping and hundreds of canvas mainsails flickering like birthday candles on the foamy, white-capped cake of the bay.</p>
        <p>As he reviewed the display called OpSail 2000 from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, President Clinton said: ''On this Fourth of July, standing in the shadow of Lady Liberty, we must resolve never to close the golden door behind us and always not only to welcome people to our borders but to welcome people into our hearts.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who accepts the rights and responsibilities of citizenship is our fellow citizen, equal in the eyes of God, entitled to be treated equally and with dignity by all of us.''</p>
        <p>By nightfall, the crowd, which stretched from the Battery to the George Washington Bridge on the west and from the South Street Seaport to above Roosevelt Island on the east, turned its attention from sea to sky as 60,000 pyrotechnic shells, rising from 13 barges spread across the harbor, sizzled, whined and burst, conjuring a hothouse of exotic flowers in midair. The rich blossoms of red, blue, yellow and green exploded once in the black of the night, then again in reflective flashes on the glassy facades of buildings and the dark surface of the water.</p>
        <p>Independence Day began with a sultry, humidmorning in the New York area as temperatures hovered in the low 70's and pewter clouds massed above the harbor, giving the ships a somber elegance. Gathering in the early-hour heat, the vessels slipped like brigands past the shores of Gravesend Bay, gliding slowly through the mist toward eager crowds.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon, the haze had retreated but the overcast sky had been soldered into an unbroken scrim of clouds above a wonderful sight -- an armada of full sails stretching into the distance, fireboats spraying red, white and blue parabolas of water into the air and military jets booming over the  clogged harbor, which was covered in a bright white Jackson Pollock splatter of pleasure boats.</p>
        <p>From piers and decks, rooftops and shoreside restaurants, from apartment living rooms and from lampposts and the hoods of strategically parked cars, the crowds  watched the antique vessels drift by with a speed and courtliness seemingly drawn from a distant, gentler age. This was how the world traveled  centuries ago, at the pace of nature and at the discretion of capricious  winds.</p>
        <p>With so many gathered to watch the parade -- 10,000 packed onto the U.S.S. Intrepid and its berth at 46th Street alone -- there was bound to be confusion. A brief spell of disappointment hit the masses gathered on the Upper West Side, for example, when many of the tall ships turned around at 54th Street, following what organizers said was the flotilla's prearranged route.</p>
        <p>''We're calling it Slop Sail,'' said Kate Foster, who watched with a sinking heart from her apartment on Riverside Drive and 113th Street as the full-rigged brigs and barkentines came about and sailed south before reaching her and a dozen guests. ''We have friends over and everyone's gathered around, but there's better coverage on television. It's a real disappointment.''</p>
        <p>But over all, the day seemed to marshal the city's and nation's highest spirits, not only among those lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the parade's aviary of fluttering jibs but even among those far from the display, at backyard barbecues, small-town festivals, or at picnics, amusement parks and beaches.</p>
        <p>At a traditional ceremony in Mount Vernon, N.Y., village elders  read aloud the Declaration of Independence and rang an iron bell cast in 1758, once for each of the 13 colonies. At the Nathan's hot-dog eating contest in Coney Island, the winner, Kazutoyo Arai of Japan, wolfed down a record 25 frankfurters in 12 minutes flat.</p>
        <p>For many Americans, though, the Fourth of July was not a day of grand, or even goofy, celebration but simply a day off from work -- a pleasant patch of summer on which to kick back and forget the job, catch up with distant cousins over the smoke of a charcoal grill or sit alone on a plastic lawn chair with a cold can of beer and a hot slab of ribs, thinking of nothing more profound than a second helping of potato salad.</p>
        <p>The nation was at peace this Independence Day and enjoying unmatched prosperity. The country's scientists had cracked the human genetic code. It was a nation where taxi drivers traded stocks by cell phone from their cabs and young people enriched by the Internet could retire to lives of leisure.</p>
        <p>Still, there were problems. Pockets of poverty remained outside the citadels of wealth. Schools struggled to educate the young. Many in the nation lacked health insurance.</p>
        <p>The august tall ships were made of simple and practical stuff -- iron, pine and oak -- and seemed to be symbols of the durable values of ingenuity, craftsmanship and rugged self-reliance. At the same time, however, the ships were relics of the past.</p>
        <p>OpSail 2000 was the fourth in a series of nautical extravaganzas over the last three decades.</p>
        <p>In 1976, a patriotic throng lined the waterfront to witness more than 225 ships sailing under 31 national flags in remembrance of America's bicentennial. Ten years later, a similar crowd gathered to mark the 100th birthday of the Statue of Liberty. And in 1992, the parade's organizers --  perhaps straining for a theme --  declared the day a celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the New World.</p>
        <p>The procession yesterday was  billed as the largest naval operation in history, and its organizers said it would contain more floating vessels than D-Day or the Spanish Armada. While 70,000 sailing craft of all types were expected, far fewer -- perhaps as few as half -- showed up.</p>
        <p>Led by the 295-foot American three-masted bark Eagle, the Parade of Sail eased under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge shortly after 9 a.m. in a northwesterly wind of less than 10 miles per hour. A regal line of 180 tall ships led the fleet, followed by scores of modern and antiquated military craft and surrounded by as many as 30,000 recreational boats.</p>
        <p>At a parade on Staten Island, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spoke of the blessings of being an American --  liberty, freedom and the democratic way -- before marching amid a brass band that played the national anthem and ''New York, New York.''</p>
        <p>Across the harbor, many people were drawn to a replica of the 129-foot Spanish schooner Amistad, whose slave cargo of 53 Africans revolted in 1839 and three years later won their freedom after historic arguments before the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''Out of all these ships, this is the only one I have a vested interest in,'' said April Smith, 35, of Brooklyn.  ''It's the only ship here that tells the story of my ancestors. To me, it's what liberty is all about.''</p>
        <p>Amistad was berthed at Pier A at Battery Park, which drew plenty of sea-gazers of its own with the promising perch of an iron railing from which to watch the panoply of passing ships and the banking gulls in front of the Statue of Liberty's upheld torch.</p>
        <p>''They said this would be the biggest event ever and I had to see it for myself,'' said Alan Baker, 51, as he muscled his way through the crowd. ''I've never seen so many ships in my life.''</p>
