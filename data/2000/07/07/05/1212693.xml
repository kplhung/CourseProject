        <p>''Sir, is the president on board yet?'' Iris Lowe, a cook on the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, asked.</p>
        <p>Her commander, decked out in a spotless white uniform and a ''Chow Boss'' name tag, nodded in the affirmative as he dashed through the narrow corridor.</p>
        <p>Neither had any hope of seeing President Clinton, who was seated on deck while fighter aircraft passed overhead and tall ships sailed by. There were bleachers for several thousand guests, including Yogi Bera and John Glenn. Marines, in blue slacks and short-sleeve khaki shirts, kept lines in order.</p>
        <p>Below, however, in the steaming galleys, sailors had hastily set up production lines near the trays of sliced meat and pans filled with fried chicken wings. To the 400 sailors detailed to feed the crowd, the ceremony above was nothing more than an insatiable hole into which food and drink had to be frantically poured.</p>
        <p>''We were told 3,000, but we got 6,000,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Don E. Holmes of Henderson, Tenn. ''All our tents and tables were blown down last night in the 50-knot winds. No one has had more than a couple hours of sleep. This is a warship, not a cruise liner. We planned for one event and have been blasted into another. We are in survival mode.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke, exhausted sailors trudged up narrow stairwells, often negotiating six flights carrying cellophane-covered pans. ''I have been down here since 2:30 this morning,'' said a cook, Jeffrey A. Johnson, 33, of Lynn, Mass. ''We set up for breakfast, but then the boats with the visitors just didn't stop coming.''</p>
        <p>There was still dinner to prepare, not only for the crew of nearly 5,000 and their families, but also for the secretary of defense and other invited guests. Once it was over, however, most of the sailors would get three nights in New York. Some had never been to the city. ''I am sure it is nice to visit,'' said Barry E. O'Neal, 35, a cook from Knoxville, Tenn., ''but all I want to do now is sleep.''</p>
