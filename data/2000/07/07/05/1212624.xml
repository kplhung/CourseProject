        <p>Editorial urges Congress to raise visa cap temporarily on number of skilled workers allowed into US for period of up to six years, noting demand for high-tech workers has outstripped supply; says it should also correct severe injustices in immigration laws that hurt immigrants who have been in country for more than decade</p>

        <p>With unemployment rates at a 30-year low and strong growth in the high-tech sector, many technology companies are hard pressed to find enough programmers and other skilled workers to meet their needs. One way industry has dealt with the labor shortage has been to hire skilled foreign workers who are allowed to come to this country under special, temporary H-1B visas. But now demand for skilled workers is outstripping the number of such workers allowed in each year by statute. Congress needs to raise the visa cap temporarily to ease the shortages. It should also correct some severe injustices in the immigration laws that have hurt immigrants who have been in this country for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Under current law, H-1B visas, which permit foreign workers to stay in the United States for up  to six years, are capped at 115,000 for fiscal year 2000 and will decline to 65,000 in 2002. There  is bipartisan support in Congress to increase  that cap for a limited time. One reasonable proposal, sponsored by Representatives David Dreier, Republican of California, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, would increase the cap to 200,000 visas per year through 2003. Their bill would  set aside a number of the visas for nonprofit  research institutions and would require that 60,000 visas be reserved for people with advanced degrees. The proposal would also increase the visa application fee to $1,000 from $500 and direct the money toward job training and education programs.</p>

        <p>The Clinton administration supports a temporary increase in the visa cap, but with higher fees than the Dreier-Lofgren plan. It also wants Congress to correct some other immigration problems.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Congress granted permanent residency to Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees who fled oppression by their leftist regimes in the 1980's. But it granted only lesser forms of relief to Guatemalans and Salvadorans who fled right-wing regimes, and it neglected Haitians and Hondurans. Congress should dismantle these distinctions and allow Central American refugees to apply for permanent residency on an equal basis.</p>
        <p>Congress should also cure a legal mess left over from the 1986 immigration overhaul. At that time Congress granted amnesty to illegal aliens who had been in the country before 1982. But some 300,000 people were improperly denied the opportunity to apply for amnesty by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>Years of litigation followed, with the courts ruling in favor of the immigrants. Then in 1996, Congress stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these cases, leaving these immigrants, a great number of whom had been granted work authorization, in legal limbo. A sensible bill now pending in Congress would allow these individuals and other similarly situated people who have been here since the mid-1980's to stay permanently.</p>
