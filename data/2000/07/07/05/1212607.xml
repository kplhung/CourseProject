        <p>Intelligence officials, military officers and policy experts in the Clinton administration are deeply divided over the seriousness of missile threats posed by countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, even as the administration says the United States needs to build a national missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Officials at the State Department dissented from an intelligence report last fall that stated that North Korea could soon develop a ballistic missile that could threaten the United States. They are also quite likely to dissent again as intelligence agencies prepare a new assessment for the president, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>Some officials in the White House, State Department, Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency argue that the threat has been almost exclusively defined by technological abilities and that the emerging analysis discounts political, economic and social factors that could make a threat less likely.</p>
        <p>The officials said the intense focus on missiles that could hit American soil also obscured the more immediate threat posed by nuclear weapons carried by terrorists or fired from ships. The officials said the change in focus devalued the concept of deterrence, by which the sheer force of the American arsenal would inhibit even the most irresponsible leader from attacking American soil.</p>
        <p>Dissension exists even on the technological side. A senior Pentagon official acknowledged that Iran's ballistic missile program had problems and was ''certainly not clicking along really fast.''</p>
        <p>The Pentagon schedule to build a missile defense is entirely driven by the belief that North Korea will have a long-range missile by 2005. Indeed,  the coming intelligence report will reportedly find that North Korea could develop a missile that could strike the United States by 2005, the same finding that was in the report last year.</p>
        <p>In the case of Iran, the study last year reported that some experts believed that the threat was ''likely before 2010.'' Others have said there is ''less than an even chance by 2015,'' a split that persists.</p>
        <p>As for Iraq, officials agree that Iraq will pose no concrete threat to the United States as long as international sanctions remain in place.</p>
        <p>The assessments are crucial, because they are driving the decision by President Clinton to decide in the fall on proceeding with a $60 billion program to build a limited missile defense in five years. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said -- as recently as this week -- he will make his decision on four factors, the cost, the technological feasibility, the effects on other countries and the urgency of the threat.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has declared the existence of a threat in five years. ''I believe by the year 2005 a threat will be present that could threaten the security of the United States,'' Mr. Cohen said in an interview on CNN on Saturday.</p>
        <p>That finding is being fiercely contested by some officials, including experts on Korea, who point to North Korea's suspension of its missile tests in the fall and the progress between the leaders of North and South Korea since their successful meeting last month.</p>
        <p>The intelligence report being completed for Mr. Clinton is known as a National Intelligence Estimate and is supposed to reflect the consensus of all the intelligence agencies, including, among others, the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But as experts from those agencies have contributed their views and information to drafts in recent weeks, there is little consensus.</p>
        <p>In fact, as a missile defense has emerged as an important difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush in the presidential campaign, many intelligence officials have complained that what is supposed to be a coldly analytical process has evolved into a roiling political debate.</p>
        <p>In the report last year, the rules of classic intelligence analysis were altered, the officials said, to measure not whether countries were likely to threaten the United States, but whether they ''could'' do so. The officials said that change skewed the results toward the most alarming assessment.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of pressure from the Hill driving this process,'' said a longtime intelligence official involved in preparing the new report. ''You end up with realms of possibility, including what is least likely to what is unthinkable. We are writing in worst-case language. Frankly, from my perspective, this is nonsense.''</p>
        <p>Senior administration officials defended the process. ''We don't live here to make anybody happy,'' a senior intelligence official said. Still, that official acknowledged that people on all sides of the debate were ''looking for something in what we say to support their own arguments.''</p>
        <p>The intensely partisan politics swirling around the urgency of the threat were on display on Thursday at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, pressed Larry D. Welch, a retired Army general who heads an independent team that is reviewing the Pentagon's plans, to enunciate the extent of the nation's vulnerability to missiles.</p>
        <p>''Look straight into the cameras and say, 'We are as a nation defenseless,' '' Mr. Warner demanded after trying several ways to have the witness say that affirmatively.</p>
        <p>General Welch replied: ''We as a nation have no missile defense to deal with these threats. That's correct.''</p>
        <p>But at another point, John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''There's nothing that I'm aware of that suggests that the threat of an attack on the United States is 'increasingly likely' in the next few years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerry said the threat depended on not only the ability to build weapons, but also on ''analysis of the nature of the relationships with a country, the rationale for an attack, the possibilities of an attack, the levels of deterrence.''</p>
        <p>The central question asked by many critics of the national missile defense is why its advocates appear to have discounted deterrence as a counter to the missile threat, even though deterrence governed American strategic thinking throughout the cold war.</p>
        <p>Many senior officials have said deterrence no longer held when it came to countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. The officials regard the leaders of those countries as capable of irrational self-destructive behavior.</p>
        <p>''We didn't like the Soviets, but we roughly understood them to be extremely cautious,'' said Leon S. Fuerth, Mr. Gore's national security adviser. ''We never have had the depth of understanding about what makes the North Koreans tick to give us that confidence.''</p>
        <p>As for Iran, a senior Pentagon official pointed out that Iranians seized American hostages 20 years ago; still chanted, ''Death to America''; and were involved in state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
        <p>Intelligence officials say Iran is considering developing a rocket that can put satellites in orbit, a move that would represent a significant step toward possessing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Tehran has begun discussing the project with France, India and Russia.</p>
        <p>The officials also cite Iran's efforts to develop a longer-range missile, the Shahab-4. But Iran is still faces difficulties in its program to build the Shahab-3, a missile with a range of 780 miles. Those problems have prompted experts to question the Iranian missile threat to the United States. ''There is an Iranian threat to U.S. forces in the region, not to the continental United States,'' said an official.</p>
        <p>Some officials complain that all the attention focused on the potential missile threat diverts attention from more likely threats like chemical or biological weapons prepared in the United States and hidden in a truck or even a cruise missile carried aboard a ship.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Cohen acknowledges those facts. ''I think the act of terrorism taking place on the United States is more likely than intercontinental ballistic missile,'' he said in his interview on Saturday.</p>
        <p>But at another point he added, ''To say that we can't protect against everything doesn't mean that we shouldn't protect against those that can cause us catastrophic harm.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials vehemently deny that the missile program is aimed at curbing the military ability of Russia or China. The analysis last year and the report being prepared find that the United States defines those two countries as a threat only in the case of an accidental unauthorized launching.</p>
        <p>But especially on Capitol Hill there are those who argue that the ultimate threat is China's ability to strike the United States. Five years ago, an unpublished report prepared for the House National Security Committee by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization cited the possibility of China's ''using its ballistic missiles to prevent U.S. action in Korea'' as a pivotal threat that justifies a defensive shield.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to talk about North Korea, Iran and Iraq, but people don't like to talk about Russia or China,'' said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. ''But people privately also are a little worried that there could be another threat from China. I'm candidly telling you that behind closed doors you hear some people expressing some concerns about ultimate threats like China.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 8, 2000, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about American officials' views as to the seriousness of missile threats posed by countries including North Korea, Iran and Iraq misstated the service background of Larry D. Welch, who heads an independent panel reviewing the Pentagon's missile defense plans. He is a retired general in the Air Force, not the Army.</p>
