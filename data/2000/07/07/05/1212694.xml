        <p>Yesterday, for the second time this year, New York City was at the center of all the millennial drama.</p>
        <p>The first time, as millions around the world watched New York City ring in the year 2000 at Times Square, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was at the center too. He controlled it; he starred in it. He was the man.</p>
        <p>But that was then, and yesterday, as the city became the stage for a Fourth of July spectacle of historic proportions, the mayor was a sideline guy.</p>
        <p>He said that he would view the fireworks, but that he had no planned public role in the evening's events.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Giuliani had sailed for two hours on the U.S.S. Mount Whitney, but he left the parade of tall ships early and disembarked at Staten Island to march in the 90th annual Travis Day Parade, which he has done for the last 12 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was joined on the ship and at the parade by Judith Nathan, the woman with whom he has acknowledged having a relationship.</p>
        <p>''I definitely had to come to Travis even though the OpSail was going on,'' Mr. Giuliani told reporters before stopping for lunch at a local firehouse. ''To me this is what the Fourth of July is all about.''</p>
