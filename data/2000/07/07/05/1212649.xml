        <p>In his April interview with federal investigators, two very different Al Gores seemed to be present, law enforcement officials say. One was a confident master of detail, and the other was a defensive witness who could not recall basic facts about his fund-raising activities in the months before the 1996 election.</p>
        <p>At the outset, Mr. Gore remembered with precision how long he had served as vice president and as a senator from Tennessee. ''I've been vice president for seven years and two months and 28 days,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Before that, I was a member of the United States Senate for eight years and 18 days.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In his April interview with federal investigators, two very different Al Gores seemed to be present, law enforcement officials say. One was a confident master of detail, and the other was a defensive witness who could not recall basic facts about his fund-raising activities in the months before the 1996 election.</p>
        <p>At the outset, Mr. Gore remembered with precision how long he had served as vice president and as a senator from Tennessee. ''I've been vice president for seven years and two months and 28 days,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Before that, I was a member of the United States Senate for eight years and 18 days.''</p>
        <p>But later in the April 18 interview, Mr. Gore said he did not know whether the now-infamous luncheon that he attended at a Buddhist temple in California was a fund-raising event. He disputed the suggestion that White House coffees were used as fund-raising events by the Democratic Party -- although millions of dollars flowed from the people who attended them. And the vice president said he thought he had attended only one White House coffee when documents showed that he had attended 23.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Gore was so meticulous in his recall of some matters (at one point describing himself as a ''stickler to a fault'' who sometimes corrected the grammar of his campaign letters) that they doubted his vague responses to questions about his campaign finance activities.</p>
        <p>That contradiction fueled investigators' skepticism about Mr. Gore's truthfulness. Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head of the Justice Department's campaign task force, recommended that Attorney General Janet Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate the vice president's veracity during the four-hour interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad is focusing on three principal areas of inquiry, law enforcement officials said. None of the issues are new: the vice president's appearance at the luncheon at the Buddhist temple, his attendance at White House coffees and his fund-raising telephone calls from the Executive Mansion.</p>
        <p>On June 23, after he ordered his lawyers to release copies of the 123-page transcript of his interview, Mr. Gore told reporters, ''I think the truth is my friend in this.''</p>
        <p>Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the vice president's office, said, ''This isn't news. This is archaeology, and it has no relevance to the kind of issues that the vice president is working on and the American people care about.''</p>
        <p>What follows is a status report on the significant matters in the Gore inquiry.</p>
        <p>Hsi Lai Temple Luncheon</p>
        <p>THE ISSUE -- On April 29, 1996, Mr. Gore attended a luncheon organized by John Huang and Maria Hsia, both of whom were Democratic fund-raisers, at the Hsi Lai Temple, a Buddhist monastery near Los Angeles in Hacienda Heights, Calif. The luncheon with about 100 community leaders was one of the first campaign finance controversies to embroil the vice president, who was invited to the temple by a leader of the group, which is based in Taiwan.</p>
        <p>The event raised the issue of whether the temple had held a political fund-raiser in violation of its tax-exempt status as a religious institution and whether temple monastics were illegally reimbursed for contributions. There was also the question of whether Mr. Gore knew it was a fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Gore said in an October 1996 interview with National Public Radio that the luncheon was a ''community outreach'' event. But in January 1997, a spokesman for the vice president said Mr. Gore ''knew it was a finance-related event.''</p>
        <p>THE INVESTIGATION -- Investigators found that Mr. Gore routinely attended fund-raisers and community outreach events organized by the Democratic National Committee. Some documents suggested confusion among Mr. Gore's staff because the vice president initially planned to attend two events in a single day in Los Angeles, one a fund-raising luncheon and the other a visit to the temple. The two stops were melded into one because of time constraints.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno decided against appointing an independent counsel to review  Mr. Gore's fund-raising, although he was not questioned about the temple event until last April. Justice Department prosecutors brought criminal charges against two fund-raisers involved in the temple luncheon. Mr. Huang pleaded guilty for his role in soliciting about $159,000 in donations from people who attended the event and from temple monastics. In an appearance before a House committee, Mr. Huang testified that he had no evidence implicating Mr. Gore in any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>In March Ms. Hsia was convicted of campaign finance violations, including helping to arrange for donations to be made in the names of monks and nuns who were later reimbursed by the temple.</p>
        <p>THE VICE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS -- In one of the most caustic exchanges of his April interview with prosecutors, Mr. Gore angrily denied that he had been told by aides that the temple event was a fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''I sure as hell don't recall having -- I sure as hell did not have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising event,'' Mr. Gore testified.</p>
        <p>UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS -- Mr. Conrad is said to be dissatisfied with some of Mr. Gore's answers. Several documents indicate that Mr. Gore's staff knew that the purpose of the luncheon was to raise campaign contributions. Because of the discrepancy between Mr. Gore's responses and some of the documents, Mr. Conrad has recommended that a special counsel be appointed to investigate the matter further.</p>
        <p>The White House Coffees</p>
        <p>THE ISSUES -- Mr. Gore's attendance at White House coffees, which were used by the White House in 1995 and 1996 to help the Democratic Party raise millions of dollars in campaign contributions. From November 1995 to August 1996, the White House organized 103 coffees. Guests contributed $26.4 million, and of that total $7.7 million was contributed by guests within one month of attending a coffee, usually held in the White House Map Room.</p>
        <p>THE INVESTIGATION -- Charles G. La Bella, a former head of the Justice Department task force, investigated the White House coffees, and concluded that they required no further inquiry. And late in 1997, Ms. Reno also decided that the coffees merited no further action.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Conrad, who was appointed by Ms. Reno in late December, decided to ask Mr. Gore questions about the coffees. Mr. Gore disputed Mr. Conrad's suggestion that White House coffees were used as ''fund-raising tools'' by the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad asked, ''In your opinion, there simply was no quid pro quo of attendance at a coffee, payment to follow?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore replied, ''That is absolutely my impression.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad asked if it was true that Mr. Gore had served as host of 23 White House coffees and sat in with President Clinton at 8 others. ''Would that be an accurate statement?'' Mr. Conrad asked.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' the vice president said.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Gore said he could not recall attending any coffees. ''This was on the president's side of things,'' he said. ''That's my memory and impression.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said it ''was not my practice to go to any of these coffees.'' He added, ''There may have been one that I attended briefly, perhaps because some of the invitees were known to me and wanted to say hello.''</p>
        <p>Two days after the interview, Mr. Gore's lawyer, James F. Neal, acknowledged in a letter to Mr. Conrad that Mr. Gore misunderstood the question, and thought it dealt only with ''White House coffees.'' Mr. Neal wrote that according to the vice president's schedule, Mr. Gore had attended 4 White House coffees and he had acted as host of 21 coffees in the Old Executive Office Building.</p>
        <p>UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS -- The discrepancies between the documents and Mr. Gore's hazy recollection of his role in the coffees have prompted Mr. Conrad to recommend that Ms. Reno appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter.</p>
        <p>White House Phone Calls</p>
        <p>THE ISSUE -- From December 1995 to April 1996, Mr. Gore made 45 fund-raising telephone calls from his West Wing office in the White House. The calls raised the issue of whether Mr. Gore may have violated the Pendleton Act, an 1883 civil service law, which bars elected officials from using federal property to raise campaign contributions. The law was designed to prevent officeholders from pressuring their subordinates into making political donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his calls from his White House office. Mr. Clinton made similar calls from his White House quarters, which is not considered official government property.</p>
        <p>Among those Mr. Gore called was Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment Television Holdings. In one document disclosed by a House committee, a call sheet prepared by the Democratic Party, Mr. Gore was told to ask Mr. Johnson ''to write $30K for the media campaign.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation,  Mr. Johnson said he took Mr. Gore's call and then wrote a check to the Democratic Party for $30,000. Later, a Democratic Party finance officer noted on a computerized record of the vice president's fund-raising: ''$30K in.''</p>
        <p>THE INVESTIGATION -- In 1997, Ms. Reno absolved Mr. Gore of any wrongdoing in connection with the phone calls. She found that Mr. Gore's calls were intended to raise money only for general party purposes, a category known as soft money. She concluded that Mr. Gore did not realize that part of the money was funneled into hard-money accounts that were used for Clinton-Gore re-election activities but were restricted by federal election laws.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Ms. Reno's findings were challenged when investigators obtained a Nov. 21, 1995, memorandum written by David M. Strauss, then Mr. Gore's deputy chief of staff. On the memorandum were Mr. Strauss's handwritten notes that suggested Mr. Gore might have known that some of the money raised by his calls was allocated to direct re-election activities.</p>
        <p>In a series of interviews with prosecutors, four participants in the meeting, including Leon A. Panetta, the former White House chief of staff, recalled that Mr. Gore was present for a discussion of how the money was to be allocated. But seven or eight others told investigators  they could not recall a discussion about money raised by phone calls going to the restricted hard money accounts.</p>
        <p>MR. GORE'S COMMENTS -- When interviewed by prosecutors on Nov. 11, 1998, Mr. Gore said he was sometimes inattentive and missed parts of the fund-raising meetings. According to F.B.I. notes on the interview, Mr. Gore said he ''drank a lot of iced tea during meetings, which could have necessitated a restroom break.''</p>
        <p>UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS -- In December 1998, Ms. Reno cleared Mr. Gore of wrongdoing. In reaching her decision, she rebuffed recommendations from six senior aides and relied instead on the advice of a single trusted adviser, Lee J. Radek, the chief of the Justice Department's public corruption unit.</p>
        <p>But in the last several weeks, Mr. Conrad, urged on by the F.B.I., concluded that Mr. Gore's truthfulness about the phone calls should also be examined by an outside prosecutor.</p>
