        <p>In the late 1930's the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig spent some time in Brazil and wrote a curious, awestruck book called ''Brazil: Land of the Future.'' The book repeatedly makes the point that while Brazil never had what it desperately needed at any particular time (coal in the 19th century, gasoline in the 20th, etc.), it constantly revealed new, surprising lodes of natural wealth. The point Zweig was making, at a time when Brazil was in an economic shambles, was that the country always had the power to reinvent itself.</p>
        <p>Last year New Yorkers could easily have gotten the impression that Brazil desperately needed new talent in popular music. A long parade of great Brazilian musicians performed and released new recordings, and the press paid them considerable attention. But these musicians were mostly members of the older musical establishment, which led one to wonder whether there was enough great music in Brazil for such a florescence to occur every year, and whether any good new artists were on the rise there.</p>
        <p>Some recent recordings provide positive answers to those questions. With the street songs of carnival, the African-rooted afoxe and samba, scores of old, beloved regional rhythms, and a distinguished history of pop songwriting since the 1960's, Brazil still has impressive musical resources to feed on.</p>
        <p>A Postmodern</p>
        <p>Lucas Santtana: ''Eletro Ben Dodo''(Natasha).  Mr. Santtana, a young musician from Bahia whose first album bristles with funk, afoxe rhythms and smart pop songwriting, is a musician supremely conscious of his cultural coordinates. In ''E Muito Mais'' (''And Much More''), he tries to describe himself to a woman before getting into a relationship with her, and offers a list of cultural signifiers he feels close to: dub reggae, the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomble, bodyboarding, the Cavalera brothers (that would be Max and Igor, of the Brazilian metal band Sepultura). In another track, he lays the chant and beat from James Brown's ''Funky Good Time'' over a very similar Yoruba religious rhythm, making a musical point that requires no explanation.</p>
        <p>This is an artist who knows he's postmodern, and who sees his reflection in a country where postmodernism is an act of historical consciousness, rather than merely of solipsism. Fiercely literate about the popular music not only of Brazil but also of North America, Mr. Santtana smashes Net-surfing lingo up against scenarios of the urban poor, trying to conjure a natural synthesis of ancient and futuristic. This will to recombine has become a kind of shared language among new pop musicians in Brazil; it's a legacy of Chico Science's Mangue-Beat movement in the early 90's, as well as the Tropicalia songwriters of the 60's like Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil.</p>
        <p>Rhymes and Dreams</p>
        <p>Pedro Luis e a Parede: ''E Tudo 1 Real'' (WEA Brazil). Pedro Luis, from Rio, is similarly in on this very Brazilian game: creating new realities out of bits of old ones. This album, his second, takes lots of rogue, shouted ideas from old samba songs, street signs, Indian tribal names, fruits and carnival slogans, and turns them into funky music -- as the Beastie Boys might if they were playing around with 100 years of street culture instead of 20. His ''Rap do Real'' is a street-vendor song in which he's selling $1 items -- sweet pumpkin biscuits, batteries, clock radios and finally rhymes and dreams. ''Astronauta Tupy'' combines aeronautical and Brazilian-Indian imagery; ''Ae Meu Primo'' works a nursery rhyme about wooden soldiers into a funk-rock tune, stopping along the way for social commentary about poverty. Mr. Luis's hyperactive imagination is inspiring; though the music has an impressive mixture of ingredients, he and his co-writers never quite come up with strong enough musical compositions to match his fast-edit mind.</p>
        <p>Snakes, Slums and Witches</p>
        <p>Lenine: ''Na Pressao'' (BMG Brazil). This is the second of Lenine's albums since he became a solo artist, after having made collaborative records with the percussionist Marcos Suzano, and his mature work is patient and impressive: he's making a great case for using traditional northeastern Brazilian forms like the forro in modern pop. But he makes his mixtures sparingly; he has less to prove. his strong, melodic voice is world-weary, and his music doesn't have the anarchic spark of Pedro Luis. The title cut (''Under Pressure'') reimagines Brazil as a supernatural land of witches, snakes and random battles. ''Relampiano'' (''Lightning'') mixes accordion and trip-hop drum-programming to tell a story of broken homes in the slums, touching lightly and poetically on the triangulation of mother, father and baby. Throughout, Lenine plays acoustic-guitar funk over drawling electronic rhythms, and the album takes its time to grow on you.</p>
