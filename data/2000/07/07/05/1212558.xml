        <p>ONE of my favorite Indian dishes is a cold salad that goes by the piquant name of chicken chat. I rarely see it on menus, and a good version of it is even rarer. But Royal Kabab and Curry, an unassuming restaurant near Morningside Heights, has perfected this dish, which makes a perfect summer appetizer or, with a double order, just the right light meal.</p>
        <p>The word chat means mouthwatering, and that describes this dish of shredded chicken, green apple and potato, combined with cucumber, onion and tomato. It is dressed in a sauce with coriander, green chilies, mint, tamarind, a little yogurt and coarse, smoky Indian black salt. The result is a wonderful study in contrasts -- hot and cool, sweet and sour, bright and earthy -- that refreshes and stimulates the appetite.</p>

        <p>The word chat means mouthwatering, and that describes this dish of shredded chicken, green apple and potato, combined with cucumber, onion and tomato.

        <p>Chat was originally a northern Indian dish, a nibble that was quickly prepared and spicy, made only with vegetables so it would keep well. Julie Sahni, the Indian food authority, says the dish began to change in the 1970's, when Americans started to get a taste for tandoori chicken. Restaurants were left with extra chicken, which some added to chat. And chicken chat was born.</p>
        <p>Royal Kabab and Curry, 2701 Broadway, at 103rd Street, (212) 665-4700. Chicken chat is $2.25. Delivery: 72nd Street to 125th Street, Riverside Drive to Central Park West.</p>
