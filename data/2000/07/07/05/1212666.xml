        <p>South Koreans braced for impending financial chaos next week as tens of thousands of bank workers supported a nationwide strike set for July 11, according to preliminary results of a vote by some 50,000 industry workers. Around 90 percent of unionized bank workers at 24 financial institutions, including 8 of the nation's 10 major commercial banks, voted in favor of a nationwide strike to protest government plans to restructure the industry, which call for the consolidation of a number of banks. Union workers contended the plans would lead to major layoffs. The final results of the vote, which began on Monday, are expected early today.</p>
