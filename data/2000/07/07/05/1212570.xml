        <p>AARON COHEN, the founder of Concrete Media in Manhattan, is your average Internet workaholic. His hours, he says proudly, ''are somewhere between management consulting and investment banking.'' In other words, an hour or two short of ''all the time.'' He can do this because he has no children and because his wife, Nina del Rio, is the general manager of Sothebys.Amazon.com, so she is never at home, either.</p>
        <p>Employees at Mr. Cohen's three-year-old company (which builds Web sites, nurtures them, then declares them independent and moves on), all work the way their boss works.</p>
        <p>''When I first started here, we went to lunch and he asked me, 'Where do you see yourself in five years?' '' said Elaine Brosnan, the manager of media relations for Concrete Media. ''I said, 'Personally or professionally?' And he said, 'Aren't they the same thing?' ''</p>
        <p>The staff of 130 can work like this because until very recently, not a single one of them had children.</p>
        <p>Old-fashioned companies -- ones from the Stone Age of five or six years ago -- were a reflection of the real world. Older workers. Younger workers. Some without children. Some with grown children. The preoccupations of life were evenly spread, so that everyone in the room wasn't worried about finding a date or a baby sitter or a college loan at exactly the same time. Dot-coms, of course, are anything but the real world. They are frat houses or college dorms, and the entire staff grows up (or not) together.</p>
        <p>Over at Concrete Media, everyone is about to grow up. Mr. Cohen and Ms. del Rio are having a baby. Ry Sidney Cohen is due any day now, and he has already proved that it's not just consumer demand or market forces that cause a company to change.</p>
        <p>''My intention is to be a highly focused father,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''I understand that it's important to balance my life. I'm determined to figure out how to do it.''</p>
        <p>For starters, he now leaves the office in the middle of the day to attend every one of his wife's doctor appointments. He has decided not to travel through mid-September. (The baby is due on July 20.) He insisted that a company meeting, scheduled off site in New Jersey in July, be rescheduled because he might not make it home in time should the baby decide to arrive. Instead of staying out late at high-profile dinners, or having low-key drinks with employees, he is usually home nowadays, with his very tired wife. He can be found there reading the magazines Fast Company and Red Herring as well as T. Berry Brazelton ''at the same time,'' he says, and worrying whether being a chief executive will be of any use at all when it comes time to help his son with the newest version of the new math.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's altered focus is being felt at the office. Concrete Media has added 10 employees the last five months who are age 38 or older. This ''influx of grown-ups,'' he says, brings the median employee age to the late 20's, up from the mid-20's. A number of the new employees were hired to create a benefits department, which the company does not yet have. It has no maternity-paternity policy, either, though one is in the works, and Mr. Cohen plans to take a week off immediately after the baby is born and a total of six weeks off within the first six months.</p>
        <p>There is also talk of including a day care center in the new offices that are being prepared for occupancy in August at the Starrett-Lehigh Building downtown. ''Working parents need this,'' he said with the fervor of the newly converted. ''There would be such a demand if you could figure out how to do it right.''</p>
        <p>At 33, he says, he has come to understand that maturity is a good thing. ''We see this company as being around for a long, long time,'' he said. ''We need to hit a stride that is sustainable over the long haul. If I can't learn how to be a parent and an executive, then I can't imagine how I can ask my employees to do that.''</p>
        <p>This transformation, while welcome, is making some of his employees a little nervous. They're not quite sure what to make of this man who expects to have a life. ''We're a company that's been following our leader,'' Ms. Brosnan said. ''We don't know what's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>But for those who worry that their boss is slowing down so much they will not recognize him, consider this. ''We dropped out of Lamaze,'' he said. ''It was just too slow. That's the Internet in me; I don't have that kind of patience. We'll read the books instead.''</p>
