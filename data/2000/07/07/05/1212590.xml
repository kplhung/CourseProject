        <p>Just days after Zimbabwe's fledgling opposition party splashed into Parliament, its jobless supporters were still digging for dreams.</p>
        <p>There is talk of gold hidden beneath the red soil on a deserted farm here. And this morning, desperate men and women were clawing into the earth, hunting for the glimmers that might buy a bag of rice or a pair of secondhand shoes.</p>
        <p>It is hopeless, backbreaking work, and the diggers pray that their new representatives in Parliament will help ease unemployment, which stands at nearly 50 percent, so they can find jobs.</p>
        <p>''We are thinking our lives will change now,'' said Francisca Makumbe, 32, as she hauled a sack of the red earth to the river for panning. ''There is no future in this.''</p>
        <p>But while the strong showing of the opposition in the parliamentary election this week has heightened expectations among the urban poor, economists predict that the coming months will only bring more hardship to a country already staggering through its worst economic crisis since 1980.</p>
        <p>In a new study, the United Nations Development Program reported that the number of people living in poverty in Zimbabwe surged from 40 percent to 75 percent in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Government spending on health and education has dipped so sharply that schools routinely run short of textbooks, hospitals go without medicines and the sick are increasingly turning to traditional medicine and prayer.</p>
        <p>Economists fear that the worst is yet to come. While neighboring countries in southern Africa this year are expected to enjoy their highest growth rates since 1996, Zimbabwe's economy is expected to shrink, perhaps as much as 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The opposition, which won 57 seats in the 150-member Parliament, lacks a majority and control over the government's fiscal policy, which has been characterized by chronic budget overruns.</p>
        <p>Bankers and business executives say economic recovery will depend largely on foreign investment and financing from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But in a ranking of the economic prospects of African countries issued this month by the World Economic Forum, Zimbabwe placed next to last, dimming most hopes for private investment.</p>
        <p>With President Robert Mugabe vowing to reinstate price controls and to seize white-owned farms without compensation, there is little chance that Western donors will rush to fill the void.</p>
        <p>And so in an abandoned field of tall grass and white butterflies, the prospectors here will likely cling to their dreams and dig for gold while their children go to sleep hungry.</p>
        <p>''In terms of parliamentary debate, the coming of the opposition is positive, but the power they have is limited,'' said James Jowa, the research economist at the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce. ''Things are getting worse and worse. We need urgent rescue.''</p>
        <p>But investors have already suspended most expansion plans. And officials say the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which cut off financing last year after the government underreported the cost of its role in the war in Congo, want to see signs of fiscal discipline before offering aid.</p>
        <p>In coming weeks donors will be watching to see how President Mugabe realigns his cabinet, manages his budget and handles land redistribution. They will be looking for significant changes, particularly in fiscal management, in which the government's track record has been dismal.</p>
        <p>The government, which budgeted a one-third salary increase for civil servants this year, has actually increased salaries by nearly 65 percent, according to an economic analysis conducted by Standard Chartered Bank here. And the budget deficit, expected to total 3.8 percent of the gross domestic product, is now expected to soar to 12 percent by year's end.</p>
        <p>''The credibility of the regime is dead,'' said one Western official familiar with the negotiations between Western aid donors and the government.</p>
        <p>''There's not going to be any money flowing unless Mugabe changes his ways,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''The donors cannot go to their boards with a program based on promises.''</p>
        <p>The unraveling economy has also been hurt by external factors like the falling prices of tobacco and gold in recent years, two droughts and a so-called structural adjustment program that was applauded by the West but plunged many more people into poverty than expected.</p>
        <p>Under such programs, international lending organizations demand that countries living beyond their means reduce spending on public projects and cut subsidies that often keep the cost of living down. ''We all underestimated the social impact of the program,'' said a Western economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''And when we recognized it, we didn't get our act together quickly enough to help.''</p>
        <p>Members of Mr. Mugabe's party, who still control the cabinet and Parliament, say they are keenly aware that they must address the economic crisis. But the cabinet is split between those who want to move toward a socialist, managed economy and those who embrace the market.</p>
        <p>But there is no doubt of the sense of urgency. Inflation stands at about 50 percent and is expected to soar. For many of the diggers here, meat and shoes without holes have become unimaginable luxuries.</p>
