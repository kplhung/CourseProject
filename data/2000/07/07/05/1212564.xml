        <p>I USED to say that my favorite picnic site was a good French restaurant with the windows open. Nowadays, though, I prefer something more exposed to the elements -- like a terrace in Provence, or perhaps the garden at Barbetta on West 46th Street. Or more realistically, my own backyard with its rusted Weber grill.</p>
        <p>Food is no problem in these verdant settings. Volumes have been written about summer victuals, and no magazine lacks for stories on color-coordinated dinners for 12 among the vines in Napa, or on a deck in Amagansett. No, the challenge is always to find wines that can stand up to the rugged outdoors.</p>

Or more realistically, my own backyard with its rusted Weber grill.</p>
        <p>Food is no problem in these verdant settings. Volumes have been written about summer victuals, and no magazine lacks for stories on color-coordinated dinners for 12 among the vines in Napa, or on a deck in Amagansett. No, the challenge is always to find wines that can stand up to the rugged outdoors.</p>
        <p>It's a simple matter in restaurants. The choices are laid out for you on the wine list, and there is usually, though not always, someone standing by to help.</p>
        <p>In Madrid recently, after a morning at the Prado, my wife and I had lunch in the garden at the Ritz, almost next door. In Spain, on a warm summer afternoon, there is only one choice, rose: in this instance, the beautiful Rosado Gran Fuego from Bodegas Julian Chivite in Navarre. Chivite has always had a way with roses, and this 100-percent grenache, well chilled, is as good as it gets.</p>
        <p>Back in New York, at the only Roman garden on 46th Street, I would ask the owner, Laura Maioglio, for something from the Piedmont, an arneis perhaps, from the Langhe. A good arneis, like Bruno Giacosa's, and a few other choices, like Antinori's Della Sala chardonnay and the Ronco dei Gnemiz pinot grigio, have some flavor and body. Alas, so many Italian white wines are watery and forgettable.</p>
        <p>Outdoor dining at home, on a beach, on the afterdeck of someone's boat or in the woods is another matter. Since it's usually at least a bit casual, no one expects much from the wine. It should be chilled and, like the conversation, uncomplicated and light-hearted. And it doesn't hurt if the price is easy-going as well. Accordingly, few of the wines discussed here reach $20; most are $10 to $12.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say picnic wine shouldn't be stylish. For example, why have just another sugary California chardonnay when there are so many beautiful rieslings available from Alsace, from Germany and even from New York's Finger Lakes? Riesling is lighter bodied than most American chardonnays; its flavors are intense but more subtle, and the wine is generally lighter in alcohol, between 9 and 11 percent, an important consideration in hot weather.</p>
        <p>Trimbach and Hugel are two of the best-known Alsatian producers, and their rieslings, even at the lower end of the price scale, are impeccable. Good German rieslings at the modest kabinett level are not always easy to find, moderately priced. Labels to look for include Egon Muller, Robert Weil, J. J. Prum, Lingenfelder and Burklin-Wolf. The German rieslings are not as dry as the Alsatians, but they are excellent with food; their touch of sweetness is invariably balanced with good acidity. Closer to home are the Finger Lakes rieslings. Some of the best come from Hermann J. Wiemer of Dundee, N.Y. His rieslings are lean and intense in the best traditions of the Rheingau which is where he is from.</p>
        <p>What about red wines when dining al fresco? Are they too heavy, too wintry? Well, let me answer with a question. Suppose you were grilling a thick steak or a butterflied leg of lamb or just a juicy hamburger --  would you want to drink a white wine with it? Possibly, but I hope not.</p>
        <p>Say what you will, red meat cries out for red wine. It doesn't have to be a great Bordeaux or an imposing pinot noir, French or American. But just about anything else red: zinfandel, of course, or one of the dozens of sirahs that have popped up from France, Australia and California.</p>
        <p>Why not an old-fashioned petite sirah, one of California's few remaining untamed red wines? A bit rough, perhaps, but with lots of color and flavor. Foppiano, an old-line Sonoma County winery, has long championed petite sirah and knows how to make it. Benziger has a good one, too.</p>
        <p>If there is an all-purpose red wine for outdoors, it's Beaujolais. Not the chichi single-vineyard and old-vine Bojos that have been turning up recently: I'm talking about the unadorned, grapey, purple-red Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages one has come to know and love. Serve them from jelly glasses or Baccarat, chill them if you prefer, drop in an ice cube when no one is looking. Many have tried, but no one has come up with any wine to match the versatility, the availability and the still-reasonable price of Beaujolais. Georges Duboeuf is Mr. Beaujolais, but he has lots of worthy competition.</p>
        <p>Oh yes: barbecue and chili. Outdoor foods, yes, but wine-friendly? Let's say they present a challenge. It's a bit of a stretch, but maybe one of those macho 16.5-percent-alcohol zinfandels from California might do the trick. Cecil Deloach makes them when conditions are right. Since beer has always been the traditional fire extinguisher for these delicacies, switch to wine at your own risk.</p>
        <p>There is another possibility. Once, at a garden party, I was served a succession of incendiary Thai dishes accompanied by beer, of course, and, of all things, Gallo Hearty Burgundy, the wine of my misspent youth. Amazingly, it worked. Hearty Burgundy has a big, uncomplicated taste and just enough sweetness to defuse, partially anyway, that fiery fare.</p>
        <p>It doesn't have a screw top anymore, but I wouldn't serve it to the directors of your wine society. Well, maybe from a decanter.</p>
