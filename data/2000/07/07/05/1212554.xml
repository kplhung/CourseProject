        <p>FOR a drink that seems quintessentially American, lemonade is at its purest in France. Any cafe there will serve what is called a citron presse, a glass filled partway with pulpy, freshly squeezed lemon juice along with a carafe of water and a jar of simple syrup or superfine sugar for diluting and sweetening to taste. It is the essence of fresh lemons, the antithesis of the artificial or too-sweet lemonades so common in this country, where even children are considered capable of making a pitcherful to sell at a sidewalk stand.</p>
        <p>Citron presse, though, is always the same.  In New York, now that imaginative chefs  have embraced the concept, lemonade is becoming more of a many-splendored drink, made in myriad fruit flavors. What these chefs are concocting are tart, lemony beverages that easily rival the French ideal. Their innovations could reawaken interest in homemade lemonade, and not just for children.</p>

        <p>FOR a drink that seems quintessentially American, lemonade is at its purest in France. Any cafe there will serve what is called a citron presse, a glass filled partway with pulpy, freshly squeezed lemon juice along with a carafe of water and a jar of simple syrup or superfine sugar for diluting and sweetening to taste. It is the essence of fresh lemons, the antithesis of the artificial or too-sweet lemonades so common in this country, where even children are considered capable of making a pitcherful to sell at a sidewalk stand.</p>
        <p>Citron presse, though, is always the same.  In New York, now that imaginative chefs  have embraced the concept, lemonade is becoming more of a many-splendored drink, made in myriad fruit flavors. What these chefs are concocting are tart, lemony beverages that easily rival the French ideal. Their innovations could reawaken interest in homemade lemonade, and not just for children.</p>
        <p>City Bakery off Union Square has been ahead of the curve for years, serving an excellent version of lemonade as a summertime sales builder to replace the hot chocolate dispensed in cold months. The owner, Maury Rubin, is so passionate about lemonade that he offers at least two types every day, one plain and one flavored with the juice of a seasonal fruit. Last week the seasonal fruit drink was a pale red cherry lemonade, just slightly sweeter than the plain.</p>
        <p>Esca, in the theater district, is also using cherries in lemonade, although the chef, David Pasternack, started out in the spring -- when the restaurant opened -- by flavoring it with rhubarb pulp. As apricots and peaches become more available, he says, he plans to continue varying the recipe. Esca also offers lemonade spiked with Campari, which may be the best adult version ever created.</p>
        <p>At Gotham Bar and Grill, the house lemonade is flavored with fresh ginger and whatever berries are in season. The ginger  lends a peppery note to the combination, whether strawberries, raspberries or both are used. Joseph Murphy, the pastry chef and lemon squeezer, says the summery drink sells well at lunchtime as an alternative to bottled water when diners are drinking less wine and cocktails.</p>
        <p>Other restaurants are relying on other fruit flavors for lemonade. Avenue on the Upper West Side makes a sweet strawberry version to serve in a glass coupe with a ripe red berry perched on the rim. Bayou in Harlem adds lime and mint, while Rustic in Brooklyn is using pomegranate juice. Throughout this whole month, Cucina at Macy's is featuring a different lemonade flavor every day, from mango to cantaloupe.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Daniel Silverman at Union Square Cafe simply heightens the pure lemon flavor by adding dried lemons and lemon grass. ''The lemon grass has a bright, citrusy element to it, while the dried lemons add a deeper, base note,'' he said. ''But you  can't actually taste them. In the end it just tastes like really good lemonade.''</p>
        <p>So does the old-fashioned plain lemonade at Good in Greenwich Village, which is tart but not sharp and filled with thinly sliced lemons. The chef, Steven Picker, first makes a simple syrup by boiling and stirring a cup and a half of sugar with a cup of water until the granules dissolve. After it cools, he combines it with 2 cups of juice freshly squeezed from about 16 lemons, adds 6 cups of water and chills it completely to make enough lemonade for 10 people or one sidewalk stand.</p>
        <p>Once it's finished and poured over ice, it's even better than a citron presse, since you  don't have to mix it yourself.</p>
        <p>CHERRY LEMONADE  Adapted from Esca  Time: 30 minutes plus chilling</p>
        <p>3 cups cherries, pitted and stemmed (about 1 pound), plus extra for garnish  1 cup sugar  1 cup fresh lemon juice (about 8 lemons).</p>
        <p>1. Using a juicer or food mill, juice cherries. Reserve juice.</p>
        <p>2. In a small saucepan, bring sugar and 1 cup water to a simmer. Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Pour syrup into a pitcher, and add 1 cup cherry juice, 1 cup lemon juice and 2 cups water. Chill until thoroughly cold, at least 2 hours. Serve over ice, garnished with 2 cherries.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>GINGER-BERRY LEMONADE  Adapted from Gotham Bar and Grill  Time: 50 minutes plus chilling</p>
        <p>3 cups sugar  1 1/4 cups coarsely chopped fresh ginger  1 cup sliced fresh strawberries or raspberries, or a combination  4 cups fresh lemon juice (from about 32 lemons)  Lemon slices for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan over high heat, combine sugar and ginger with 8 cups water. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally until  sugar dissolves. Boil for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer from heat, and let cool for 15 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve, discarding solids, and refrigerate until well chilled.</p>
        <p>3. Set aside about a third of the berries for garnish. In a blender or food processor, process remaining berries until smooth. Strain puree through a mesh sieve, pressing berries with back of a wooden spoon to extract as much juice as possible. Discard  solids.</p>
        <p>4. In a pitcher, combine ginger syrup,  strained berries and lemon juice. Serve over ice, garnished with reserved berries and lemon slices.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>LEMONADE WITH LEMON GRASS AND DRIED LEMON  Adapted from Union Square Cafe  Time: 25 minutes, plus chilling</p>
        <p>2 cups sugar  1 stalk lemon grass, chopped  1 dried lemon (see note)  3 cups fresh lemon juice (from about 24 lemons).</p>
        <p>1. Combine sugar, lemon grass and dried lemon in a saucepan. Add 2 cups water, and bring mixture to a boil. Simmer 5 to 7 minutes or until dried lemon is tender. Use a spoon to squash lemon against side of pan.</p>
        <p>2. Turn off heat, and let mixture rest for 10 minutes, then strain it into a pitcher. Add lemon juice and 6 cups cold water. Chill until thoroughly cold, at least 2 hours. Serve over ice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 to 10 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Dried lemons are available at Middle Eastern markets like Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Avenue, between 28th and 29th Streets, (212) 685-3451, and Sahadi's, 187 Atlantic Avenue, between Court and Clinton Streets, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4550.</p>
