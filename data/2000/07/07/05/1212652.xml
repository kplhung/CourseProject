        <p>THIS town, which served as a headquarters of the Revolutionary Army, usually celebrates the Fourth of July with a dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence, complete with muskets and tricorn hats. But this year, Morristown also had a live-action drama showcasing those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
        <p>The action began when a white supremacist from Mississippi won the right in court to hold a rally here yesterday. Richard Barrett, whose Nationalist Movement oath declares ''the white race is the superlative civilizer,'' said he chose Morristown because of its history. Just as George Washington ''said no to the privileges of the king, today we're saying no to the privileges of minorities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett got what he wanted yesterday -- helmeted police protecting his right to march on Washington Street, a crowd of angry counter-protesters that drew pepper spray and 10 arrests. A perfect forum for a man with bullhorn and bombast. Mr. Barrett brought to town an anemic anti-affirmative action protest and a racist version of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
        <p>But on Monday night, as Mr. Barrett prepared to deliver his divisive message, Morristown made its elegant statement. About 1,000 people filled the Calvary Baptist Church for what was billed as a celebration of diversity. There were clerical collars and embroidered yarmulkes, prayers read in Spanish and Tamil, and a community brought to its feet by a guitar-strumming cantor, then brought to critical mass by a stirring soloist from the church.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett's name was hardly mentioned, but Morristown wouldn't have done it without him. ''We are here tonight to reject any notion that one race is superior to another,'' Calvary's pastor, the Rev. Jerry Carter, said to cheers.</p>
        <p>The service and a candlelight march to the Morristown Green were arranged at the urging of the mayor, John J. DeLaney Jr., who was looking for a way to counter Mr. Barrett without giving him the satisfaction of a confrontation.</p>
        <p>The town has about 17,000 residents --  about 15 percent black and 20 percent Hispanic -- and just around the corner from Calvary church is evidence that all is not harmonious. Outside a house, a sign commemorates the death of a black resident who was killed last year by the police in a neighboring town. Prosecutors cleared the officers, but, for some, his death remains an example of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>MONDAY night, though, was a display of racial accord. Rabbi David Nesson of Morristown's Jewish Community Center reminded the crowd that Washington once wrote to a synagogue in Newport, R.I., that one of the country's guiding ideals was ''to give to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''</p>
        <p>Jakki Dumas-Footman, 33, a financial analyst, said she felt compelled to come to the service with her daughter even though she grew up black in a largely white Morristown neighborhood and rarely felt racism. ''I've never seen a K.K.K. march,'' she said. ''I brought my daughter. She knows about the K.K.K. I want her to see it. This is our history, in a way.''</p>
        <p>Nate Moore, a 58-year-old computer consultant, came Monday night remembering that history from having grown up black in Alabama. Mr. Barrett's message ''really astounded me,'' he said. ''I really thought these days were passed.''</p>
        <p>The songs of equality at the church recalled the old days, Mr. Moore said, but there were more white faces in the pews,  and the ranks of racists were thinner. ''I think you have to accept the differences and move on,'' he said. ''I think that's what we're doing more of -- accepting the differences and moving on.''</p>
        <p>But moving on is not a straight course.</p>
        <p>Monday night's harmony gave way to yesterday's ugliness. Mr. Barrett's sad parade of eight followers was separated from an angry crowd of about 250 by barricades and helmeted police on horses. At the height of the event, protesters from groups including the Progressive Labor Party were hurling vile taunts at the police as some protesters knocked down barricades and threw golf balls and batteries.</p>
        <p>Asa Watkins, an 83-year-old artist from Morristown, had come to oppose Mr. Barrett, but was taken aback by the anger on both sides.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins was reminded that Washington had spent two treacherous winters in Morristown on the way to victory. This Fourth of July freedom had another tough, but victorious, round in Morristown. ''It's a messy process, democracy is,'' said Mr. Watkins, leaving the rally. ''It always is.''</p>
