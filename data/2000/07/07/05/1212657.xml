        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'' makes many of us wonder whatever happened to President Clinton's Initiative on Race. Mr. Clinton announced formation of this major step toward racial justice in our society in 1997, establishing an advisory board to the initiative, with the wonderful choice of the historian John Hope Franklin as chairman. In 1998 that group issued its report ''One America in the 21st Century: Forging a New Future.''</p>

        <p>Since then, not a word has been heard from the White House. Can it really be that President Clinton will simply let this promising initiative die, once again showing how easily America can ignore racism in all its institutionalized and personal forms?</p>
