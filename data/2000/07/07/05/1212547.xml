        <p>SUMMER turns the clock back. We recapture childhood, eat hog dogs at street fairs, have picnics, sip lemonade and hanker for old-fashioned treats like strawberry shortcake.</p>
        <p>So, how do you like your strawberry shortcake? Made with layers of feathery golden spongecake slathered with whipped cream and studded with berries? Or with a rich, crumbly biscuit as the underpinning for the cream and fruit?</p>
        <p>Today, both are considered shortcake, though technically a shortcake is a sweet biscuit-style cake made with a lot of shortening (hence the name) or butter. If the spongecake style is for you, so is ''Retro Desserts'' by Wayne Harley Brachman (Morrow, $27). It claims its recipe, called ''diner-style strawberry shortcake,'' is the one diners always used. But in ''Diner Desserts'' (Chronicle Books, $18.95), Tish Boyle begs to differ, saying her biscuit-style strawberry shortcake is the true diner classic. Can we take a vote?</p>
        <p>Both of these new cookbooks are filled, cover to cover, with mostly timeless favorites, many of which -- like the shortcakes, all sorts of ice cream specialties, a sumptuous fresh strawberry chiffon pie and moist crumb-topped blueberry muffins -- are suited to summer.</p>
        <p>''Retro Desserts'' has fancier sweets, like crepes suzette, brandy Alexander pie, eclairs, cherries jubilee and baked alaska, but no recipes for coffeecake, cobbler, doughnuts or muffins. The source for those, as well as for German chocolate cake, is ''Diner Desserts.''</p>
        <p>But there's plenty of overlap in the books: Boston cream pie, coconut layer cake, black-and-white cookies, rum-raisin rice pudding and butterscotch pudding show up in both.</p>
        <p>I was delighted to find finely tuned recipes in each book. Mr. Brachman, who worked as the executive pastry chef at Mesa Grill and Bolo in Manhattan and now has the same position at Michael Jordan's: The Steakhouse, Tapika and the Strip House, which will open soon, is a rare restaurant chef: he has written a book without the help of a professional cookbook writer. He obviously tested his recipes with great care on home equipment. It's no surprise that Ms. Boyle, the food editor of the magazines Chocolatier and Pastry Art &amp; Design, knew what she was doing when it came to recipe writing.</p>
        <p>Though I loved some of Mr. Brachman's innovations, like using white chocolate in brandy Alexander and grasshopper pies, I was not tempted by some of his more cockeyed numbers, like cookies made with chow mein noodles, rocky road ''pizza'' on a chocolate crust, or cornflake macaroons. And I wish I could have prepared his Nesselrode pie using commercially prepared fruit instead of having to concoct a liquor-soaked mixture at home, with canned chestnuts, no less. On the other hand, I wanted to make his mousselike mile-high peach pie from scratch with fresh fruit, but he called for frozen fruit only.</p>
        <p>Similarly, though the peach cobbler in ''Diner Desserts'' calls for fresh peaches, the cherry pie uses canned fruit. That's the downside to throwback baking. It's too bad the author did not suggest fresh fruit as an alternative.</p>
        <p>''Diner Desserts'' updates peach cobbler with crystallized ginger, which I liked, but I omitted the orange zest in that book's black-and-white cookies. I preferred Mr. Brachman's version, which calls for a touch of lemon. I also liked his rice pudding, made simply with half-and-half, better than Ms. Boyle's custardy version.</p>
        <p>If pushed, I'd have trouble picking one book over the other, because the recipes are never highfalutin, and are so reliable that they're truly fun to prepare and serve. That's what summer's all about.</p>
        <p>STRAWBERRY CHIFFON PIE  Adapted from ''Retro Desserts''  Time:  1/2 hour, plus baking time for pastry and 2 hours' chilling</p>
        <p>1 quart strawberries, hulled, plus 8 big berries for garnish  1 1/4 cups sugar  2 envelopes plain gelatin  1 cup heavy cream plus  1/2 cup optional) to whip for serving  4 large egg whites, at room temperature  Pinch of cream of tartar  Pinch of salt  Pastry shell baked in 9 1/2- to 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom, cooled.</p>
        <p>1. Place berries in food processor with  3/4 cup sugar. Puree. Transfer  1/2 cup puree to a 1-quart metal bowl, and stir in gelatin to soften. Refrigerate remaining puree.</p>
        <p>2. Whip cup of cream until softly peaked. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>3. Mix egg whites with cream of tartar, salt and remaining sugar in metal bowl of electric mixer. Set bowl atop a saucepan of simmering water. Whisk mixture until very hot, 150 to 160 degrees. Transfer bowl to mixer, and beat at high speed 2 to 3 minutes, until mixture holds soft peaks and is the consistency of shaving cream. Egg whites will become very thick and white but not increase in volume as much as if beaten without heating. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>4. Set bowl of gelatin-puree over pan of simmering water until gelatin dissolves and mixture liquefies, about a minute. Gradually whisk in remaining strawberry puree. Fold into chilled whipped cream. Fold in a third of egg white mixture, then remaining egg whites.</p>

        <p>3. In large bowl, mix remaining flour with sugar, baking powder, baking soda, remaining cinnamon and salt. Make a well in center.</p>
        <p>4. Whisk egg into melted butter. Whisk in buttermilk and vanilla. Gradually pour into well, stirring to combine ingredients. Do not overmix. Fold in blueberries. Divide batter into muffin cups and top each with crumble mixture.</p>
        <p>5. Bake about 35 minutes, until cake tester comes out clean. Cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 large muffins.</p>
        <p>BY THE BOOK  Correction:  July 12, 2000, Wednesday  The By the Book column in the Dining section last Wednesday about two cookbooks focusing on old-fashioned desserts misstated an ingredient in a recipe for cherry pie in ''Diner Desserts'' by Tish Boyle, and then based its criticism of the book on that error. The recipe calls for fresh or frozen cherries and describes canned cherries as ''a distant third choice.'' But the column said it called for canned and added: ''That's the downside to throwback baking. It's too bad the author did not suggest fresh fruit as an alternative.''</p>
