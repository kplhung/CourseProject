        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Growing Up, Growing Apart: Fast Friends Try to Resist the Pressure to Divide by Race'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, June 25) was painful to read. But  most distressing is the role schools play in this story.</p>
        <p>Maplewood Middle School and Columbia High School in New Jersey could make a positive difference. Educators would have to examine their beliefs and behaviors and make a school commitment to integration.  Then they could design learning experiences that bring young people together to talk about these issues.</p>

        <p>Nothing is more interesting to adolescents than their own lives. Talk and attention would lead to change. The traditions of secondary schooling, including the rigid separation of what is taught from what teenagers care about, must be retired when they drive wedges through the community and reproduce injustice.</p>
