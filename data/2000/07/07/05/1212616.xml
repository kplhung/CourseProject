        <p>New York City opens its schools today for a vast summer school session serving more than one out of four students and costing hundreds of millions of dollars, part of a reshaping of public education that presses students to meet ever-higher standards.</p>
        <p>The program was started after years of pressure from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to end the practice of social promotion -- the automatic advancement of children to the next grade even if they are failing -- and is part of a trend sweeping urban school districts across the country.</p>
        <p>It will keep 8 out of 10 city public schools open for a five-week session in which nearly 16,000 teachers will teach more than 250,000 students, which officials say is the most ambitious summer-school program in New York City in at least a generation.</p>
        <p>And yet the Board of Education's own data and complaints from teachers suggest that the policy is not as strict as it appears, and that the standards for sending students to summer school are so open-ended that social promotion is continuing. Out of more than 160,000 students in elementary and middle school who are being sent to summer school this year, fewer than half are being compelled to attend under the threat of being left back when regular classes resume in September, according to preliminary estimates.</p>
        <p>The rest of the students, though still academically marginal, are being sent to summer school for what the Board of Education is calling ''enrichment.'' Unlike the first group, they are not required to take a test at the end of the summer to be promoted to the next grade.</p>
        <p>''The school system is so big, and the gap between rhetoric and reality is so big, that it's very hard to sort out how real the ending of social promotion is,'' said Raymond Domanico, an education consultant to the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of church and community groups.</p>
        <p>Some school officials said privately that the numbers of students being compelled to attend were being kept deliberately low, because experience in other cities, like Chicago, suggests that it is hard to manage and to educate large numbers of students who have been forced to repeat grades.</p>
        <p>Last year, students in New York City were assigned to summer school if they were below the 15th percentile on reading and math tests. This year, the criteria have been expanded to include attendance and overall classroom work, allowing for much more discretion on the part of the teachers.</p>
        <p>Middle-school teachers and teachers' union officials have complained that eighth-grade teachers in particular have been systematically pressured by their principals to promote students who received failing grades, to avoid burdening overcrowded middle schools with problem students.</p>
        <p>Officials are hoping to avoid the problems that marred last year's summer school program, when 35,000 students in the third, sixth and eighth grades were required to attend summer school as part of a pilot program.</p>
        <p>It was not until September that the Board of Education discovered that 8,800 of the 35,000 students had never showed up, and that 8,600 more students had been sent to summer school by mistake, because of test-scoring errors by CTB/McGraw Hill, which publishes the city's standardized reading and math exams.</p>
        <p>But even last year, a total of 228,000 students attended summer school, including students who had failed high school courses and elementary and middle-school students who were marginal but not failing.</p>
        <p>Asked about the program, Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday that there was a ''sound educational basis for summer school,'' but he urged parents and educators to have realistic expectations. He predicted that about half of the students compelled to attend summer school this year would pass the test at the end of the summer, about the same percentage as last year.</p>
        <p>''We should not for a moment think that all children who take summer school, even if they attend diligently, will be promoted,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It is an exercise in hope and vision and caring.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani has held up Chicago as a model. But New York's program is even more ambitious, because it holds back some students in every grade, instead of in selected grades.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani opposed Mr. Levy's selection as chancellor, and has repeatedly described the summer-school program as a major test of Mr. Levy's management ability. In one indication of the importance Mr. Giuliani attaches to the program, he will join Mr. Levy today at Public School 48 in Washington Heights to inaugurate the program.</p>
        <p>In many districts, teaching is being supplemented by private vendors of tutoring and by such test coaching services as Sylvan Learning, Scholastic, Voyager and Princeton Review. Classes will be small, with 12 to 15 students in elementary and middle school classes, compared with the usual average of 25 to 35.</p>
        <p>''Obviously you cannot do an entire year in that short period of time,'' said Michael Johnson, superintendent of District 29 in Queens.</p>
        <p>Until now, students in kindergarten through eighth grade could be held back no more than once in any grade and no more than twice before high school. Students had to be promoted out of eighth grade at age 15. But there has never been social promotion in high school, and about half of the students who enter ninth grade do not graduate within the traditional four years.</p>
        <p>The new promotion policy lifts those restrictions on holding students back, and special academies are being created for eighth graders who are being held back, to help with the transition to high school.</p>
        <p>Several eighth-grade teachers complained that they had been pressured to promote students who passed standardized reading and math tests but failed one or more of their four major courses: English, math, social studies and science.</p>
        <p>''I can think of several students who did absolutely nothing for three years and they passed, because they passed the standardized test score,'' said Cheryl, an eighth-grade teacher who asked not to be further identified, for fear of retribution.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said that several grievances had been filed charging that teachers had been pressured to change grades from failing to passing.</p>
        <p>Bob Blank, a dean at Intermediate School 364 in Brooklyn, said that he had filed such a grievance on June 2, and that it had been upheld when his principal and superintendent did not contest it. ''My school did the right thing,'' he said. ''Other schools, they made a joke of the standards.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said there had been no orders from central headquarters to relax standards.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten said she wished the school system would put the same level of ''obsessive'' attention into improving education during the regular school year.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how effective the summer program was last year. Of those who took the test for promotion, 57 percent passed it, but 74 percent of those students failed their classes again this year. Of those who failed the test, about a third were promoted anyway, indicating that once again, substantial discretion was used in making promotion decisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy defended those results yesterday, saying that if 25 percent of the most vulnerable students had been helped, then summer school was worth doing.</p>
        <p>As of June 28, there were 63,111 students in kindergarten through 8th grade mandated to go to summer school, while 100,750 more were being encouraged to go, for a total of 163,861, according to a Board of Education Web site: www.opt-osfns.org that has been designated by the chancellor as a planning tool for superintendents and principals. High school numbers remain unclear, because they are not listed on the site.</p>
        <p>The benchmark for promotion is Level 1, the bottom level, on the city reading and math test. But the statistics show that some students in Level 1 have been placed in enrichment rather than mandatory classes.</p>
        <p>Although last week's register showed 63,000 mandated students, there were 66,000 students in third through seventh grade who scored in Level 1 for reading, and 95,000 students in grades three through seven who scored at Level 1 for math.</p>
