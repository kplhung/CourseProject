        <p>With only one loss in their past nine league games, the MetroStars are the hottest team in Major League Soccer. Their success can be attributed to contributions from different and better players.</p>
        <p>The worst team in the league last season with a 7-25 record, the MetroStars have made a remarkable turnaround. With 14 games left in the season, the MetroStars (9-7-2, 29 points)) have already surpassed last season's totals and lead the New England Revolution by 3 points in the Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>A great deal of the MetroStars' turnaround has come from the accumulation of enough depth to overcome injuries to players like Lothar Matthaus and Thomas Dooley, two players with vast international experience who were acquired before the season to be the backbone of the team.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars now have enough depth that no one seemed overly concerned yesterday that Matthaus and Dooley will not play, even as substitutes, in tonight's game against the Dallas Burn (7-10-3) at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''We've had people step in and do the job,'' said Tab Ramos, who has been playing particularly well. ''We have 15 starters on this team, not 11, and everyone is contributing.''</p>
        <p>Matthaus (lower back) and Dooley (left hamstring) also missed the 2-0 victory in Tampa, Fla., against the Mutiny last Saturday night. But the MetroStars did fine without them. They got goals from Mark Chung and Petter Villegas in a victory that put the MetroStars into first place for the first time past the midway point in a season.</p>
        <p>Chung is doubtful for tonight's game with a deep contusion in his right heel that forced him to leave in the second half against Tampa. His place in the starting lineup will be taken by Steve Shak, the first choice in the college draft.</p>
        <p>Dallas will provide a good test for the MetroStars, who have lost the last five meetings with Dallas dating to 1997. The MetroStars want to put an end to that streak and strengthen their hold of first place.</p>
        <p>A victory tonight and another at Kansas City on Saturday will guarantee that MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano will direct the East team in the M.L.S. All-Star Game on July 29 in Columbus, Ohio. The coaches of the two teams with the best records among the league's 12 clubs as of Sunday will coach.</p>
