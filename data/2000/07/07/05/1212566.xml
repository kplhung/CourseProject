        <p>AS a dedicated follower of fast food fashions, I was at the head of the line when overstuffed burritos first landed in New York and when sandwiches changed their names to wraps. Last year, when Belgian frites shacks started appearing on every corner, I was dipping fries into mayonnaise all over Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The smorgasbord is always expanding, and no matter how novel it seems, it is always rooted in traditional street food. The newest arrivals are admirable versions of great old European standards, like waffles, sausages and crepes -- all served with American speed.</p>
        <p>Among the new kiosks, cafes and restaurants are F&amp;B in Chelsea, which calls itself a ''European-style eatery'' devoted to ''gourmet hot dogs.'' In the East Village, Bulgin' Waffles is making the case that the waffle is every bit as Continental as its more glamorous cousin, the crepe, which, by the way, has also seen a surge in restaurants promoting it recently, the latest being Rue des Crepes in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>And in Grand Central Terminal, Christer Larsson, the owner of Christer's on West 55th Street, has opened Knodel, a kiosk that treats American-style sausages with European veneration. These restaurant owners clearly recognize the value of European patina, even when applied to fast food.</p>
        <p>''I think that American appetites have become more refined, and they associate that with European culture,'' said Jeffrey Starin, the owner of Bulgin' Waffles, who decided to forsake computer programming for the waffle business after reading a Goldman, Sachs report a few years ago noting that frozen waffle sales were increasing by 12 percent a year. ''The crepe has been exploited, and so has the pancake, but not the waffle,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If the waffle is now ready for prime time, how about blini? They are the specialty at Blini Hut in lower Manhattan, along with other Russian dishes like borscht and pirogi. And where once the sandwich stood proud as the epitome of the quick American meal, little Italian panini are encroaching at places like Via Quadronno on the Upper East Side, Il Posto Accanto in the East Village and numerous other cafes.</p>
        <p>As anyone knows who remembers Zum Zum, a 1960's-era fast-food chain serving German sausages, the current wave of restaurants is not an entirely new phenomenon. And of course, hamburgers and frankfurters reflect their onetime immigrant status in their names. But as Americans have shifted their critical gaze to include not only fine wines but also items that were once taken for granted, like beer, bagels and cigars, these entrepreneurs are setting their sights on a higher order of fast foods.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Starin's spare corner restaurant, which most resembles an American college-town coffeehouse, serves wonderful waffles. The namesake Bulgin' Waffle ($4), the kind you might find in Belgium, is indeed big and thick, yet it's airy and fluffy. Even better are the smaller buckwheat wafflettes ($1.75), exquisitely light and crisp, with more flavor than the big, white-flour waffles. You won't find those in Belgium, which is Belgium's loss. The biggest drawbacks at Bulgin' are that the waffles are served on paper plates with flimsy plastic cutlery and that you have to pay 85 cents for pure maple syrup or any of the excellent fruit syrups.</p>
        <p>F&amp;B, a sleek storefront decorated in soothing pastels with pleasant lighting, offers a more self-consciously European visage. The name stands for frites and beignets, but hot dogs are the centerpiece, including the excellent Great Dane ($2.85), a slender, red Danish sausage with bright snap to it. It is eaten just as it is in Denmark, on a roll with frizzled onions, marinated cucumbers, mustard, ketchup and remoulade.</p>
        <p>It sounds like a lot, but it's an easy mouthful, especially compared with the Top Dog ($2.85), a plumper German-style sausage topped with tame sauerkraut and crumbled bacon. Frites ($1.75 to $5) are crisp and savory, and for an extra 50 cents, they are served with toppings including aioli, blue cheese and truffle oil.</p>
        <p>If truffle oil on frites is your idea of heaven, you may as well also indulge in a small bottle of Champagne ($12). I'd stick with fresh lemonade ($2.10) or Belgian-style beer ($4).</p>
        <p>The sausages are plumper, richer and more expensive at Knodel, Mr. Larsson's kiosk in the Food Court at Grand Central. Mr. Larsson's restaurant is Scandinavian, but his sausages are American, served on fresh potato rolls with assorted toppings like hot dogs, though derived from the European tradition of creative sausage making.</p>
        <p>The fine Knodel brat ($6.95), for example, is mostly savory pork, with pureed fig for a bit of sweetness and softer texture and, surprise, pine nuts, which fit in perfectly. Knodel also serves an excellent smoky, spicy andouille ($6.95) and a sweet and smoky chicken-and-apple sausage ($6.95), both from Aidells Sausage Company. Sides include sesame-scented Asian slaw ($2), with red cabbage, carrots and raisins.</p>
        <p>Knodel, by the way, is the German word for dumpling. It has nothing to do with sausages, but Mr. Larsson said he likes the way it sounds.</p>
        <p>In recent years, crepes have been associated more with kitschy French-American restaurants of the 1950's than with French street food, and Rue des Crepes does little to remedy that. The little dining room resembles a cobblestone Left Bank street by way of Disney World, complete with street signs and other contrived cues. But it matters little, because the crepes are very good. Savory combinations, wrapped in soft buckwheat crepes, include merguez sausage with white beans and garlic ($7.95) and chewy flank steak with caramelized onions ($7.95). I especially enjoyed sweet fillings, like Nutella and banana ($5.50), and the simple lemon and butter ($2.95) wrapped in white-flour crepes.</p>
        <p>You won't think you're in Paris, but you won't think you're in the 50's anymore, either.</p>
