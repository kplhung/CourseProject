        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your series ''How Race Is Lived in America'' has been eye-opening and disturbing. Eye-opening because I was unaware how much organized and casual racism still exists  throughout American culture.</p>
        <p>Disturbing because those profiled in the various articles, whatever race they were, seemed to say: The racial divide in our country is still wide, and there's nothing that can be done about it.</p>

        <p>This is as intolerable as racism itself. I realize this is not a struggle that can be won overnight, but it is a struggle that should be fought.</p>
