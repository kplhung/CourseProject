        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You have printed a number of letters regarding the peddling of bottled water (''Water Pressure: Never Greater,'' June 14), and the various devices used to thwart the waiter who is doing the peddling. Please understand that the waiter is following the directions of the restaurateur or the manager. There is a significant profit in the sale of bottled water, as well as in the specials of the day (usually without announcing the prices). In many cases, if the waiter doesn't produce a significant amount of charges for both of these items, he or she is admonished.</p>
