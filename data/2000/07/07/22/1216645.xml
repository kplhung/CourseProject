        <p>Hip-hop was still nearly new when rappers began to argue, with rhymes and beats, about what it meant to be ''real hip-hop.'' Was it party chants, boasts, storytelling, social comment, preaching, audio cinema, history, advertisement? Was it limited to two turntables and a microphone, or could it add any sample or studio music a producer wanted to use? Should it be realistic, cartoonish, self-aggrandizing, community-minded? Should it amuse, scare, uplift or pander to audiences?</p>
        <p>The working answer is all of the above, some of the time. Musically, hip-hop is now wide open, but a clear schism has developed over lyrics. On one side, the one with lopsided commercial success, is gangsta rap, exploiting and glamorizing lives of crime in the tradition of blaxploitation movies and outlaw songs. On the other is an increasingly assertive rejection of gangsta rap, which insists that the style feeds harmful black stereotypes and gives young listeners bad role models. The non-gangsta forces sound conversational and lighthearted, and they're determined to show off intelligence rather than bluster.</p>

        <p>The working answer is all of the above, some of the time. Musically, hip-hop is now wide open, but a clear schism has developed over lyrics. On one side, the one with lopsided commercial success, is gangsta rap, exploiting and glamorizing lives of crime in the tradition of blaxploitation movies and outlaw songs. On the other is an increasingly assertive rejection of gangsta rap, which insists that the style feeds harmful black stereotypes and gives young listeners bad role models. The non-gangsta forces sound conversational and lighthearted, and they're determined to show off intelligence rather than bluster.</p>
        <p>While West Coast gangsta rap fills arenas on Dr. Dre's Up in Smoke tour, non-gangsta rap has its own package tour this summer: the Spitkicker tour, headlined by De La Soul, which sold out Roseland on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>It's a show that's tinged with nostalgia for the late 1980's, before the domination of gangsta rap, when new hip-hop hybrids seemed to be emerging weekly. One was Native Tongues rap, named after a coterie of groups that included De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest. It was playful, understated hip-hop, with sly wordplay over jazz-tinged vamps and silly samples. And while it was steamrollered by gangsta rap by the mid-1990's, lately it has been rebounding, picked up by new groups like Dilated Peoples and Jurassic 5. Common, one of the opening acts at Roseland, described De La Soul as ''the family tree'' for his kind of hip-hop.</p>
        <p>De La Soul has been trying to jawbone hip-hop away from gangsta rap since its 1996 album ''Stakes Is High'' (Tommy Boy), and the crusade continues on its next album, ''Art Official Intelligence'' (Tommy Boy), to be released in August. Maseo, De La Soul's disc jockey and third rapper, spelled out the message of one new song onstage; he said it urged rappers who write about guns and drugs, ''Instead of explaining from the glorification side, explain it from the consequences side, too.''</p>
        <p>But De La Soul wraps its serious purpose in party spirit. Onstage, the rappers Posdnuos and Dove traded their low-key studio approach for exuberant shouts while Maseo boosted the bass riffs. De La Soul's rappers kept their swinging, syncopated delivery yet made it as aggressive as any gangsta rap. They bounced from their new album back to their 1989 debut album, ''3 Feet High and Rising'' (Tommy Boy), from the urgent message of ''Stakes Is High'' to wry boasting both old, like ''Ego Trippin','' and new, as the rapper Redman joined them in De La Soul's current single, ''Oooh.''</p>
        <p>Common, using a disc jockey instead of the band he recently brought to Central Park Summerstage, switched back and forth between earnest intentions and swaggering boasts. He had a costume change for nearly every song, invoking the 1970's with blaxploitation pimpwear and a b-boy's track suit; he even did some breakdancing. Erykah Badu joined him to sing the chorus of ''The Light,'' a love letter in praise of womanhood. Pharoahe Monch was more rough-hewn, combining the speed of Native Tongues rap with the raunch, but not the crime stories, of gangsta rap. Talib Kweli preferred consciousness-raising, rapping breakneck lines that sometimes had hints of reggae cadences.</p>
        <p>Biz Markie, an unabashedly comical growler, worked as disc jockey during the short set changes and reappeared for the concert's finale, Pharoahe Monch's ''Simon Says.'' All the rappers and friends swarmed onstage to join in, rapping along to render it nearly unintelligible but full of community spirit. It was a glimpse of hip-hop past, when every New York hip-hop event used to end with a gleeful mob scene onstage.</p>
