        <p>Lance Armstrong, who says he draws his motivation from both positive and negative sources, had both of them at his disposal today and blended them expertly to win a long individual time trial in the Tour de France by 25 seconds and solidify his overall lead.</p>
        <p>Wearing a yellow suit that was furnished to him hours earlier by the race's organizers as a symbol of his leadership, the star of the U.S. Postal Service team rode with power and smooth authority over the 58.5-kilometer course (about 36 miles) from Germany to France in hot weather to finish first in a time of 1 hour 5 minutes 1 second. He averaged 53.9 kilometers an hour (33.5 m.p.h.), the fastest pace at that distance in the Tour's 87 years.</p>

        <p>Lance Armstrong, who says he draws his motivation from both positive and negative sources, had both of them at his disposal today and blended them expertly to win a long individual time trial in the Tour de France by 25 seconds and solidify his overall lead.</p>
        <p>Wearing a yellow suit that was furnished to him hours earlier by the race's organizers as a symbol of his leadership, the star of the U.S. Postal Service team rode with power and smooth authority over the 58.5-kilometer course (about 36 miles) from Germany to France in hot weather to finish first in a time of 1 hour 5 minutes 1 second. He averaged 53.9 kilometers an hour (33.5 m.p.h.), the fastest pace at that distance in the Tour's 87 years.</p>
        <p>Second by those few and yet so big 25 seconds was Jan Ullrich, the German leader of the Telekom team, the winner of the 1997 Tour and the favorite of many fans in this individual race against the clock. Christophe Moreau, a Frenchman with Festina, was third, 2:12 behind, with Tyler Hamilton, another American with Postal Service and Armstrong's lieutenant in the mountains, fourth, 3:01 behind.</p>
        <p>''It was a big fight,'' Armstrong said. ''Jan is a big engine. I went all out, as the yellow jersey is supposed to do. This was nice to win.''</p>
        <p>Barring illness or accident, the victory guaranteed Armstrong's second successive victory in the Tour when it ends Sunday in Paris. Ullrich remained in second place over all, going from 5:37 behind at the start to 6:02 now, with Joseba Beloki, a Spaniard with Festina, still in third place but now 10:04 behind.</p>
        <p>Enormous crowds lined the road in the 38 kilometers (23.6 miles) the race traversed in Germany before passing into France for the final 20.5. The German police estimated the crowd at 1.5 million for the stage Thursday from Lausanne, Switzerland, to Freiburg, and it seemed comparable today.</p>
        <p>Armstrong said earlier that he feared the size of the crowd, both because it might make the few tight turns difficult by overflowing the sidewalk and because there might be some fan of Ullrich's who would try to prevent the Texan from beating the Telekom leader.</p>
        <p>If, at the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) time check, he had no chance of victory, Armstrong continued, he would probably slow down to prevent any possible aggression. But the American led Ullrich by five seconds and the rest of the 129-man field by a minimum of 1:40 at that point and kept on pushing.</p>
        <p>Besides, he had plenty of motivation. The positive influence was his desire not to become the fifth Tour winner since World War II and the first since 1990 not to have won a daily stage when the three-week race is done.</p>
        <p>Although he said 10 days ago that he did not care how many times he finished second -- three in this 87th Tour -- as long as he was first in Paris, he has changed his tune lately. ''I would be disappointed not to win a stage,'' he admitted this week. Last year, in his first Tour victory, he won four stages to go with two in previous races.</p>
        <p>The negative influence was this question asked at a news conference Thursday by an Italian journalist: ''Do you think Ullrich can make up the 5:37 and win the Tour tomorrow?'' Armstrong called it one of the dumbest questions he had been asked, and he refused to answer.</p>
        <p>Armstrong was still smarting over the question this morning when he was encountered on a training ride as he worked up a sweat and readied his legs for his long, solitary race four hours later.</p>
        <p>''What planet did that guy fall down from?'' he asked a reporter in an adjoining car.</p>
        <p>Otherwise relaxed and friendly, bantering at 40 kilometers an hour (24.8 m.p.h.) as he moved along on his bicycle with a team car escorting him, he reported that he was feeling good, and promised, with a confident smile, to give his answer in the Tour's press room after the race.</p>
        <p>''Where's the guy who asked that question yesterday?'' Armstrong said.</p>
        <p>Ullrich was heavily favored to win the stage because, as Armstrong put it a few days ago, ''It's in his adopted hometown, and that gives you a big push.''</p>
        <p>The German, a native of Rostock in the east, has lived for years in the village of Merdigen, a sprint away from the start in Freiburg. Many of the flat roads used in the time trial were the same ones Ullrich used in training and he undoubtedly passed many of the suppliers of the cream pies that the habitually overweight rider puts away in quantity every winter.</p>
        <p>Alluding to the German's weight problems, Armstrong added: ''I still declare he's the biggest talent in cycling. I think he needs to be perhaps a little more serious in the winter, but he has a lot of class.''</p>
        <p>Or, as Jean-Luc Vandenbroucke, a former Tour rider and former directeur sportif of the Lotto team from Belgium, put it this morning: ''Ullrich has to realize that races are won in the winter. You can't come into the season 10 kilos overweight, with all the problems that causes, and expect to begin training for the Tour in May or June.''</p>
        <p>After riding himself into top condition in the first two weeks of the Tour, Ullrich looked svelte today in the jersey of the world time trial champion. He rode splendidly, but 26 seconds too slowly.</p>
