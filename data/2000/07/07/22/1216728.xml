        <p>Ronnie Fatato, the unrepentant gentrifier of Park Slope, is a man with sad, drooping eyes, and he assures you that deep down he is a real softy. But then there is that sign at the entrance to his offices. ''Show Me the Money,'' it commands. The sign, he says, fits him fine, too.</p>
        <p>In his office one day, Mr. Fatato -- a robust Show-Me-the-Money version -- insists that he does not care, not even a little, that a powerful neighborhood group called the Fifth Avenue Committee has branded him a destroyer of Park Slope, a landlord of uninhibited greed who evicts poor families to get twice the rent from Manhattan refugees venturing into Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>What, he asks, do the do-gooders know about him? Do they know about his wife, a social worker who drives her Eldorado into Harlem? Do they know that he was born above his grandfather's beer business in lower Park Slope, or that his family hung tough back when the lower Slope was a ramshackle mess. As others pulled out, the Fatatos expanded into real estate and meatpacking. Where were the do-gooders when Ronnie Fatato, home from 14 months in Vietnam, was shoveling hamburger alongside Hispanics?</p>
        <p>So now, as prosperity pushes the professional hordes right into Ronnie Fatato's lap, he asks another question: Why shouldn't he cash in? Where is the sin in clearing out ''undesirables''? Hey, he tells you, he would love to live on Park Avenue, but he can't afford it. Do you hear him whining?</p>
        <p>''This,'' he barks, ''isn't Russia!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatato says these things as if they were self-evident truths. Yet in truth, little is self-evident about Park Slope's latest gentrification war. It is a house of mirrors where self-proclaimed heroes extol the value of diversity, yet acknowledge their own roles in causing gentrification in the first place. Those they cast as villains profess a love for Park Slope, a hunger to improve the community -- all in the cause of raising the rents of longtime residents 50, 75, 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatato, his antagonists and his tenants demonstrate the elusiveness of easy labels in the tangled economics of Park Slope, a place where the effects of gentrification were being debated long before the first latte was sold on Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>The controversy found vivid new expression last fall when the Fifth Avenue Committee, a respected community development organization, declared a 36-block area of lower Park Slope a ''displacement-free zone.''</p>
        <p>Warning against the evils of a monochromatic neighborhood, the committee pledged to intervene on behalf of low-income residents being forced from suddenly valuable apartments. The committee's earnest young leaders said they would try quiet diplomacy first. Where that failed, they promised noisy publicity. So they bused 70 people to picket the Long Island home of a landlord threatening to evict a pair of elderly sisters. End of eviction.</p>
        <p>But when the committee turned its offensive on Ronnie Fatato, it encountered something else. One day the committee sent a Roman Catholic priest to ask Mr. Fatato to ease off on a 33 percent rent increase for a struggling single mother. Mr. Fatato, a Catholic, did not appreciate the guilt trip, and he says he strongly suspected that the committee hoped to raise its profile by making him and other landlords easy scapegoats. He sent the priest packing.</p>
        <p>There is another sign on Mr. Fatato's office wall. It reads, ''I'm the Boss, That's Why.''</p>
        <p>The Fatatos have deep roots in Park Slope, starting with Luigi Fatato, who opened the family business there in 1912. For decades the family lived in a small apartment above their Old Bohemian beer distributorship at the corner of Fourth Avenue and Second Street.</p>
        <p>Today, Luigi's grandson, Mr. Fatato, commutes from a century-old Tudor in Irvington, a village in Westchester County. A 54-year-old father of four, he has the expansive, no-nonsense air of a blue-collar boy who made good. As big city landlords go, though, he is a minor player. He owns 30 units in four rent-stabilized buildings in lower Park Slope. But he also owns four walk-ups next to his meatpacking warehouse on Second Street. Because each walk-up has only three apartments, Mr. Fatato is allowed to charge whatever the market bears.</p>
        <p>For years that was not much. In the early 1990's, he plowed money into his apartments to attract some of the same young professionals who were flocking to upper Park Slope. No one came. So Mr. Fatato continued to rent to low-income Hispanics who, over all, say they regarded him as a fair and forgiving landlord. If they fell behind on rent, he set up payment plans, or even wrote off rent debts. ''They come in, they cry the blues, how you gonna throw them out?'' he asks.</p>
        <p>The market changed last year. Finally the white-collar crowds were coming, driven down the hill by $2,500-a-month rents in the upper Slope. Mr. Fatato made his move early last summer. He informed his tenants that he intended to raise rents by 30 percent and higher, knowing that they could not afford such increases. He was counting on it. To soften the blow, and avoid costly legal battles, he paid moving expenses and waived back rent.</p>
        <p>Still, there was no sugarcoating the disrupted lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatato set up Diana Jaramillo, a single mother of four, in one of his rent-stabilized apartments. The new place has no dining room and only two bedrooms, not three. Isolda Noboa, forced to move with her three children into her parents' home, says the stress broke up her marriage. ''He destroyed our lives,'' she says of Mr. Fatato.</p>
        <p>As tenants moved out, Mr. Fatato sent in work crews to build new kitchens and bathrooms. But one tenant refused to go. Martha Marquez, 34, makes $19,000 a year in a Park Slope day care center. She and her 12-year-old son have lived in one of Mr. Fatato's walk-ups for nine years. Her rent had been raised once, to $750 from $700. Now it was going to $1,000.</p>
        <p>She went to Mr. Fatato. ''I was like, 'Why are you raising the rent so much?' And he said, 'Because I can get it.' And that's when I got angry. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it,'' she says. And then, ''You don't cut people's throats to get ahead when you're already ahead.''</p>
        <p>Looking for legal help, she turned to the Fifth Avenue Committee, where her son's godmother works. She knew nothing of the displacement-free zone, but the committee has long been a powerful force in the resurrection of lower Park Slope. For more than two decades, it has raised millions to rehabilitate 112 buildings in the lower Slope, transforming dilapidated properties into attractive affordable housing.</p>
        <p>It is a proud record, and yet the committee's leaders recognize the inherent economic contradiction: The nicer they make the neighborhood, the more people want to live there. This drives up rents, thus driving out the very low-income people they want to help. ''In some ironic way, we're a piece of the problem,'' says Benjamin Dulchin, a committee staff member.</p>
        <p>The displacement-free zone is an effort to organize a grass-roots rebellion against these sweeping forces. Throughout the zone -- between Third and Sixth Avenues, from Bergen to Second Streets -- the committee has put up posters and filled dozens of street boxes with fliers. The point, says Brad S. Lander, the committee's executive director, is to avoid the fate of upper Park Slope. His message to landlords is simple: ''Don't be greedy. Honor our racial and economic diversity along with your bank account.''</p>
        <p>The committee eagerly took up Ms. Marquez's cause. When diplomacy failed -- that is, when the priest returned empty-handed -- the campaign rapidly escalated. Local supermarkets were picketed to pressure the managers into boycotting Mr. Fatato's hamburger meat. The committee asked hundreds of people to mail postcards of protest to Mr. Fatato. Volunteers handed out leaflets outside the bank Mr. Fatato uses.</p>
        <p>''Don't let Ronald Fatato grind our neighborhood into meat patties,'' one flier said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatato raged about ''Mafia tactics,'' then fought back with a vengeance. To anyone who sent him a postcard, he sent back a letter revealing that he had sued Ms. Marquez repeatedly for not paying rent, that she was more than $2,600 in arrears, that she had repeatedly failed to abide by repayment plans. ''When we could have thrown her out,'' he says, ''we didn't.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Marquez blames bureaucratic foul-ups with her city rent subsidies.</p>
        <p>''I've been there nine years,'' she says, ''so how bad a tenant could I be?''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Fatato undaunted by bad publicity, the committee supplied Ms. Marquez with a lawyer to fight eviction in Housing Court. This, too, failed. Ms. Marquez has until July 31 to get out.</p>
        <p>So Ronnie Fatato has won, but what of the neighborhood? To the Fifth Avenue Committee, the price is clear: A group of Hispanics, longtime residents who contributed to the texture and stability of the community, has been forced out.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fatato contends that he has improved the neighborhood's diversity. His walk-ups are now a mix of black, white, Hispanic and Asian tenants, and they include a legal secretary, a box salesman and a stylist at Lord &amp; Taylor.</p>
        <p>The box salesman, Adam Goldstein, 29 and single, is thrilled with his new place. ''It's huge,'' he says. ''They're getting two grand in Central Slope for the same thing, and I've got the four best restaurants in Park Slope right here.'' He pays $1,500 a month, more than double what Diana Jaramillo paid for the same apartment.</p>
        <p>The unrepentant gentrifier couldn't be happier. He is already thinking about his next rent increases.</p>
