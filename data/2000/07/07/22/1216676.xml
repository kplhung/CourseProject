        <p>Anthony Lewis Op-Ed column deplores efforts by Tony Blair's government to weaken rule against double jeopardy, the right to trial by jury and other protections against official abuse; says it salutary that European Convention on Human Rights will become binding on British courts in October and that judges will have to measure acts of Parliament and government decrees against convention's guarantees of free speech, fair procedure and the like</p>

        <p>Thousands of American lawyers, here for the annual meeting of the American Bar Association, celebrated their ''common bond'' with English law: the legal protections of freedom developed since the barons forced King John to sign Magna Carta in 1215.</p>
        <p>The two legal systems do have much in common, but there is a fundamental difference. The United States has a written Constitution, and Americans rely on judges to enforce its guarantees against official abuse. Britain has no such higher law, and judges have been bound to carry out whatever Parliament said.</p>
        <p>That is about to change. In October, the European Convention on Human Rights will become binding on British courts. Judges will have to measure acts of Parliament and government decrees against the convention's guarantees of free speech, fair procedure and the like.</p>
        <p>What is striking to a visitor is how little understanding there is of the difference that change is likely to make. Tony Blair's New Labor government put through a statute that will bring the European Convention into British courts. But it is nevertheless coming up with one proposal after another that seems, to an outsider, to violate basic concepts of civil liberty.</p>
        <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, asked a commission last year to consider whether the rule against double jeopardy should be abandoned under some circumstances. The rule has been part of the judge-made law of England for 900 years, preventing the retrial of anyone for an offense of which he has been acquitted. It is part of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>
        <p>The British commission considering the issue has tentatively recommended a partial breach of the rule, and Conservative Party spokesmen have called for action. Mr. Straw says he will wait for the final commission report, but the expectation is that he will move to allow some retrials of people who have been acquitted. However limited, that would give prosecutors enormous discretion. Americans would surely regard the step as a drastic violation of traditional safeguards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straw also has a bill pending to deprive many criminal defendants of the right to trial by jury. Again, that would be impossible in the United States, where jury trial in criminal cases is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>
        <p>And right now Mr. Straw is pushing through Parliament an extraordinary bill to deal with the hooligans who go to foreign stadiums when British soccer teams play there. As drafted, the bill would have allowed the police to seize the passports of -- and hence prevent international travel by -- anyone they suspect is likely to act violently at a match.</p>
        <p>Guilt by suspicion, in short. Happily, the bill came under such strong criticism that Mr. Straw modified it to cover only those believed to have committed what would be a criminal offense. But even then its standards are so vague that it would raise  constitutional hackles in America.</p>
        <p>One more venture by Mr. Straw is a bill to let the state make anyone who uses coded e-mail give officials the key to decode it, so they can intercept and read it as they wish. That proposal has drawn outraged protests from leading technology companies in Britain and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Not only Jack Straw but Prime Minister Blair seems to have no concern for civil liberties. What matters, evidently, is pleasing the voters by being tough on law and order. The respected Guardian columnist Hugo Young wrote this week of Mr. Blair's ''indifference to, almost his contempt for, civil liberties.''</p>
        <p>Whether any of the legislation I have mentioned, or other bills in the pipeline, will actually be found to violate the European Convention remains to be seen. What is notable is that, on the eve of a great step for the protection of civil liberties, the government shows no sign of caring.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Britons do not understand what a difference judicial protection of individual rights can make. Some people, especially on the ideological left, say that British judges are too conservative to care about civil liberties. Such commentators have not noticed that the judges in recent years have shown an increasing tendency to scrutinize official action. Giving them constitutional power will make a profound difference.</p>
