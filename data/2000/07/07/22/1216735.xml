      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary who is heading Gov. George W. Bush's search for a vice presidential nominee, has emerged as a leading contender for the job, changing his voter registration today to make his selection possible, Republicans close to the governor said this evening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is not expected to announce his final decision for several days, and one Republican cautioned that he still planned to do some thinking over the weekend.</p>
        <p>But Republicans close to Mr. Bush said that Mr. Cheney, whose wealth of government experience includes a stint as White House chief of staff under President Ford and a long career as a congressman from Wyoming, had become a top choice of the governor's in recent days. They said that his change of registration from Texas to Wyoming was needed to pave the way for his likely, though still not assured, selection.</p>
        <p>The registration switch, which Mr. Cheney carried out today, so he could vote in Wyoming, is intended to avoid problems under the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. That provision forbids Electoral College voters to choose candidates from their state as both president and vice president. Property records from 1999 show that Mr. Cheney has a home in Casper, Wyo.</p>
        <p>One Republican close to Mr. Bush said the former defense secretary was now the leading candidate, though cautioned that Mr. Bush still had not come to a final decision. Another Republican familiar with the governor's thinking said Mr. Cheney was among the few finalists. Yet another Republican, who is close to the former defense secretary said, ''Bush really, really, really likes Cheney.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign did not offer confirmation, but did nothing to dampen the speculation about Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, told reporters at his Texas ranch today that he was going to think ''long and hard'' at the ranch this weekend and review the options that had been carefully prepared by Mr. Cheney himself. By the end of the weekend, Mr. Bush said, ''I'll be a lot closer to the decision.''</p>
        <p>His aides said the announcement would come next week, possibly as early as Monday, a week before the opening of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Other names that have figured prominently in the speculation include Govs. Frank Keating of Oklahoma and George E. Pataki of New York; Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio; and Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, John McCain of Arizona, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both of Tennessee. Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania was also under consideration, but his stance in favor of abortion rights had caused his star to dim in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bush announced this spring that Mr. Cheney, who had been his father's defense secretary, would lead his search, he praised Mr. Cheney, an executive at the Halliburton Company, a Dallas energy company, and said that his role would not preclude him from being considered for the No. 2 job himself. ''I trust Dick Cheney's judgment; I know his character,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's obviously an important decision for me and I can't think of a better person to work with on making that decision.''</p>
        <p>But other Republicans said Mr. Cheney, 59, had repeatedly insisted he did not want the job. In recent weeks, however, as Mr. Keating had looked as if he was emerging as Mr. Bush's favorite, prominent Republicans began lobbying Mr. Bush for Mr. Cheney. Many of them felt that Mr. Keating was too conservative and not impressive enough to win independent and swing voter. And several Republican Party officials pressed Mr. Cheney to reconsider.</p>
        <p>He initially fretted about his health, they said -- he suffered three mild heart attacks, in 1978, 1984 and 1988, and had bypass surgery in 1988 -- but did not say no. And he slowly warmed to the idea.</p>
        <p>''There was a huge movement for this,'' one Republican said, ''and it started several weeks ago. This did not come out of the blue.'' A Republican familiar with the conversations said that Mr. Bush's father had also been an active advocate for Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Cheney's health could become an issue, one Republican familiar with the past few days' events said the Bush campaign had checked on his medical records and health with the doctor who had performed the heart surgery.</p>
        <p>One top Republican strategist said the reaction to a potential Cheney nomination was likely to be mixed. ''Clearly this sends the signal that this team is ready for action on Day 1,'' he said. ''But for seven days we're going to be dogged by health problems and stories on the intricacies of the heart.''</p>
        <p>Concerns about whether Mr. Keating would have enough appeal had caused other Republicans to begin pressuring the Bush campaign to consider the governor's former primary rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. About 60 House Republicans petitioned Mr. Bush today on Mr. McCain's behalf, and Mr. Ridge,  Republicans said, implored Mr. McCain to reconsider in a telephone conversation on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>An associate of Mr. McCain's said the senator told Mr. Ridge that he would prefer not to be asked but would accept the vice presidency if offered it by Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain said today, however, ''I don't believe anything has changed'' since he told Mr. Bush in May that he did not want to be considered for the ticket. And Mr. Bush gave no indication he would be influenced by the pressure from House Republicans. He said simply that he was sure that Mr. McCain would be a ''loyal soldier for my candidacy.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. McCain, Mr. Cheney would bring a wealth of experience in national security to the ticket. He was a strategist of the Persian Gulf war as defense secretary under Mr. Bush's father. He has good relations with Republicans in Congress, where he was a party whip, and he has served in the White House, as chief of staff to Gerald Ford.</p>
        <p>And unlike Mr. McCain, he has no further political ambitions of his own, Republicans said, and would be devoted solely to the Bush presidency.</p>
