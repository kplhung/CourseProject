        <p>The Giants opened their 2000 training camp today on the campus of the State University at Albany, where the school's nickname for its athletic teams is the Great Danes. It was this nickname that brought about the most prescient exchange of the annual round of welcoming speeches by local officials and Giants Coach Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>The university president, Karen Hitchcock, joked that she was happy the Giants had a ''great Dayne in their backfield,'' referring to the Giants' top draft pick, running back Ron Dayne.</p>
        <p>Mindful that Dayne was unsigned as of this morning, Fassel stood and said, ''That great Dayne you mentioned has about three hours to get here, or I'm not going to be a happy camper.''</p>
        <p>Less than 30 minutes later, the Giants announced that Dayne had agreed to a five-year, $7.14 million contract with a $4.5 million signing bonus and incentive clauses that could raise the contract's value to about $9 million. And 30 seconds before the mandatory 4 p.m. introductory gathering of players and coaches at Albany, Dayne slipped inside the team meeting room, having signed his contract at Giants Stadium before dashing up the New York State Thruway.</p>
        <p>The team's first practice is Saturday at 9 a.m.</p>
        <p>Since Dayne is the key to a Giants running game in need of resuscitation, team officials were relieved a holdout was avoided.</p>
        <p>''In my 30 years in the league, I've seen that speed or skill players who hold out get hurt in camp when they do show up,'' Giants General Manager Ernie Accorsi said. ''They come in late and they start pressing right away, especially rookies. They're trying to justify the contract and they know the other players have been talking about the holdout, because they've been practicing through two-a-days.</p>
        <p>''They try too hard and pull something. It happens all the time. So I was worried about that.''</p>
        <p>Dayne, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, did not receive the $5.3 million signing bonus and four-year contract that he and his agent, Ron Hopson, had sought. Dayne's $4.5 million signing bonus is in the general range of what an 11th pick in the draft might earn, but it was far less than the $5.5 million signing bonuses that wide receiver Plaxico Burress and linebacker Brian Urlacher received from the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Chicago Bears. Burress and Urlacher were the eighth and ninth picks of the 2000 draft.</p>
        <p>And Bubba Franks, the tight end drafted three spots after Dayne, negotiated a $4.67 million signing bonus from the Green Bay Packers last week. The 11th pick over all of the 1999 draft, quarterback Daunte Culpepper, received a $5 million signing bonus from the Minnesota Vikings, although quarterbacks are generally paid higher than other players.</p>
        <p>Dayne, speaking with reporters after the team's first meeting, said he might have accepted less money so he could report on time. But that did not bother him.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't worried about it as long as I got some money,'' Dayne said. ''If I play well, then later there will be time to go back to the table for the other things. It was more important to me that I didn't get off on the wrong foot. I'll put my money in the bank -- I can't spend it at camp anyway -- and play football.''</p>
        <p>While Dayne was joining the fold, the second-round pick Cornelius Griffin, a defensive tackle, had not agreed to terms and was the only holdout of players on the active roster or those drafted by the team. The Giants have been trying to use the four-year, $2.8 million contract that the Arizona Cardinals gave linebacker Raynoch Thompson as a guideline in negotiations with Griffin. Thompson was taken one spot before Griffin in the second round. But the talks with Griffin remain at an impasse.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL acknowledged that his team was thin at cornerback and defensive end as camp opened. The Giants will continue to be in the market for another cornerback. DAVE THOMAS, signed as a free agent last winter, is the current starter at left cornerback, but he will be 32 next month and has not started a National Football League game since 1998.</p>
        <p>There are other cornerback options, but little experience to go around. EMMANUEL McDANIEL started two games last season for the Giants when their secondary was plagued by injuries, but those were the only starts of McDaniel's career. Cornerback ANDRE WEATHERS, a Giants 1999 draft pick, is still recovering from a serious knee injury last year, and the former Rutgers star REGGIE STEPHENS has no N.F.L. experience at cornerback.</p>
        <p>The Giants were interested in TERRELL BUCKLEY, the former Miami Dolphin, but he signed Thursday with the Denver Broncos.</p>
