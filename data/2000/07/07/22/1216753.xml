        <p>The man, Donovan Spence, had originally been offered probation when he pleaded guilty in 1992 in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn to charges that he robbed a store.

        <p>A federal appeals court has freed a man who spent eight years in a New York State prison, ruling that the state violated a plea agreement when a Brooklyn judge sent him there.</p>
        <p>The man, Donovan Spence, had originally been offered probation when he pleaded guilty in 1992 in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn to charges that he robbed a store. As a condition of probation, Justice Michael Feinberg told him to stay out of trouble for a year and not get arrested, or he would be sentenced to prison.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Spence was arrested -- in a robbery case in which he was later acquitted -- and the judge went ahead and sentenced him to 8 1/3 to 25 years for the 1992 robbery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence, who was 18 at the time of his 1992 sentencing, served almost the minimum sentence as his appeal made its way through the courts.</p>
        <p>Because of his acquittal in the second robbery case, Mr. Spence appealed Judge Feinberg's sentence, arguing that he had not violated the condition of his probation because a jury had found him not guilty of the second crime. His lawyers first appealed the sentence through the state courts and then to United States District Court. The courts let the sentence stand, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it violated the bargain between Judge Feinberg and Mr. Spence.</p>
        <p>In its ruling, the appeals panel reviewed the transcript of the original plea hearing. The judges found that Judge Feinberg not only told Mr. Spence that he could not be arrested during the year, but also that he had to stay out of trouble. In weighing the agreement, the judges had to determine whether Mr. Spence believed his probation was a condition of avoiding arrest under any circumstances or one of committing no further crimes.</p>
        <p>''That is to say the plea agreement could be understood either as a 'no arrest' or a 'no misconduct' agreement,'' Judge Richard J. Cardamone wrote for the three-judge panel. ''We think it was a 'no misconduct' agreement because we do not believe a youthful defendant like Spence would understand that a 'no arrest' bargain as Justice Feinberg explained it to him included an arrest in circumstances where he had committed absolutely no wrongful act.''</p>
        <p>Judge Cardamone wrote that because the panel found that the agreement was a ''no misconduct'' bargain, the sentence violated the plea bargain; and the appeals court did not have to consider whether the arrest itself was a legitimate basis for imposing the sentence.</p>
        <p>''It is time to correct what we perceive to be a miscarriage of justice, to grant the writ of habeas corpus and to release the defendant from prison,'' Judge Cardamone wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence's lawyer, Malvina Nathanson, said her client was released yesterday from Gowanda Correctional Facility near Buffalo.</p>
