        <p>Re ''No One People Owns Jerusalem'' (Op-Ed, July 16): Karen Armstrong's warning against elevating Jerusalem ''beyond the reach of compromise'' has been confirmed at Camp David, where the marathon peace talks were apparently derailed temporarily by Prime Minister Ehud Barak's insistence that Jerusalem remain the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.</p>
        <p>The American Committee on Jerusalem maintains that sovereignty over Jerusalem must be shared to allow the undivided city to serve as the capital of both Israel and the emerging Palestinian state. For Jerusalem to become truly a city of peace, no religion or nationality can have privileged or pre-eminent status at the expense of others.</p>

        <p>It may be true that in the context of war, the concept of shared sovereignty over Jerusalem is inconceivable. In the context of just and lasting peace, however, such unconventional but creative ideas are worth the effort necessary to put this conflict to rest.</p>
