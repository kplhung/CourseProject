        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your July 19 news article about the Army inspector general's report on the killing of Pfc. Barry Winchell by a fellow soldier a year ago, you quote a Pentagon official as saying: ''I am not saying that harassment hasn't occurred. But it is an exaggeration to think that every gay at the base is being harassed.''</p>
        <p>This remark is not very reassuring. The same could, after all, have been said about racial harassment when lynching was at its height.</p>

        <p>This remark is not very reassuring. The same could, after all, have been said about racial harassment when lynching was at its height.</p>
        <p>But it is also puzzling how any Pentagon official is in a position to know whether or not gays are being harassed, since any soldier who had presented himself or herself to the inspector general as gay would presumably have been discharged under the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy.</p>
