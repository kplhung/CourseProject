        <p>Camille Glad and Daiva Kezys are close in age, live in the same borough and spent part of yesterday a yard from each other on a commercial strip in northern Queens. But when it comes to their opinions on how the city should deal with the threat of the West Nile virus, the two could not be farther apart.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Glad, 64, bars her elderly mother from outings in the park and keeps her grandchildren inside when they visit from Maine to protect them from mosquitoes that carry the virus. And, though she worries that pesticides may have some risks, she says she believes strongly that the city should spray them.</p>
        <p>''You weigh one against the other, the good against the bad,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kezys, 61, says that seven people -- the number who died from the virus last year -- are not enough to justify substantial squirts of chemicals near her home. Last year's spraying, she says, left her with a six-month cough, and she fears for her dog's safety when she sees him trample the misted grass.</p>
        <p>''I think somebody is making a buck off this spraying,'' said Mrs. Kezys, a real estate agent. ''If it is so safe, why do they tell people to stay inside?''</p>
        <p>The dilemma faced by Mrs. Glad and Mrs. Kezys is an increasingly common one:  what to fear most, the threat of West Nile or the threat of the chemicals being used to prevent it? And interviews conducted throughout the city and suburbs yesterday indicated that how people react depends largely on a complex array of factors, many of them highly subjective. What is clear is that many people feel uninformed about both the dangers and specifics of West Nile, and the dangers posed by pesticides.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I've been informed enough regarding the situation,'' said Betty Heilman, who lives in Scarsdale and is an administrator for a pathology laboratory. ''They haven't had any real incidents of West Nile, so I'm reluctant about spraying. I've thought about contacting an environmental organization to actually ask them what problems they might anticipate.''</p>
        <p>People who were raised in parts of the country where riding a bike behind a truck puffing huge clouds of pesticide was childhood sport, for instance, have different views from those who never even went to summer camp. While a pregnant woman might have feared pesticides last summer, a year later, she may feel  differently now that she has a small child. People's attitudes can be shaped by where they get their news and how they feel about government.</p>
        <p>Science, in this case, is often of little help. Few people, even top epidemiologists, can illuminate much about West Nile; it was never in North America before last year. It  has no cure. The number of birds and mosquitoes infected with the illness changes every day. And while the mayor and other officials are quick to dismiss concerns about pesticides, they do not dole out much more information on the chemicals than that.</p>
        <p>''You always have questions about whether strategic public health interventions do more good than harm,'' said Prof. Gerard Fergerson, a public health historian at the Wagner School at New York University.</p>
        <p>The issue becomes more pressing each day as evidence mounts that the disease has affected bird and mosquito populations around the region. Yesterday, the State Health Department said it had discovered nine more birds carrying the virus in Rockland, Westchester, Richmond and Queens Counties, raising the  number of birds testing positive for the virus this summer to 29.</p>
        <p>Further, a mosquito carrying the West Nile virus was found farther north, in Orange County. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that in response, the city would extend its pesticide spraying to northern Queens and Staten Island, where spraying began earlier this week, in spite of protests and a lawsuit brought by environmentalists.</p>
        <p>Weighing public opinion is highly perplexing when people around the region seem so inexplicably divided over what they fear most: flying mosquitoes or the chemicals that kill them.</p>
        <p>Viewpoints are informed greatly by personal experience and even one's job. Ken Pulvidente, who owns a pet store in Amityville, N.Y., suspects that fish in area ponds died last year as a result of spraying, which led him to worry about his drinking water.</p>
        <p>''I always thought that when they sprayed last year it was ridiculous,''  Mr. Pulvidente said. ''The spraying is probably going to kill us 20 years from now. You're spraying it in the middle of residential areas. How can that make sense?''</p>
        <p>A scientific background can bring an added twist.</p>
        <p>Mary-Ann Karpel, who has studied entomology, said that she had learned that mosquitoes and people both could build up a tolerance to chemicals. It is not an environmental opposition she harbors, but a fear of what happens next. She envisions a world of supermosquitoes flying about, immune to all poisons.</p>
        <p>''Then what do we do?'' mused Ms. Karpel, munching on an ice-cream bar in a Mount Kisco, N.Y., health food store. ''You should keep your antibiotics and insecticides for desperate situations.''</p>
        <p>Political leanings can inform as well. Denise Walter, who lives in Stamford, Conn., said she was ''one of those people who trust their public officials.'' As such, she tends to believe them when they promise that pesticides are safe.</p>
        <p>And at times, notions about the disease seem to twist and re-form with seemingly little logic. Debbie Contos, 30, who lives in Astoria, Queens, said yesterday that her views on West Nile had evolved over the year, even though information about it really had not.</p>
        <p>''Last year, we didn't know it was rare,'' she said during a walk around Douglas Manor, where a dead bird was discovered this week. ''It seemed like if you got bit, you died.'' (For the record, health officials have long stressed that the chance of getting West Nile is extremely remote.)</p>
        <p>And while opinions about pesticides do not divide along age lines, there are some subtle distinctions. Marilyn Morello, 63, lives in Great Kills, Staten Island, where dead birds infected with West Nile have been discovered this month. She has grandchildren. But she fears for her own health most, and at the same time worries about the efficacy of the spraying.</p>
        <p>''I'm really scared to death,'' she said. ''I have lung cancer so I'm really worried about what the spraying might do to my lungs when I breathe the stuff in.'' She added: ''I don't know how effective spraying for mosquitoes will really be. Mosquitoes are everywhere and they can fly from place to place.''</p>
        <p>Diane Barone, who lives in the Oakwood neighborhood of Staten Island and is a teacher's aide, also worries how effective spraying is. But she adamantly supports it.</p>
        <p>''When you have children, everything just becomes much more frightening,'' she said. ''You just take so many precautions. I'm not all that concerned about what the spraying will do to humans because I heard that it doesn't really affect us, but I'm afraid that it might not completely get rid of the virus.''</p>
        <p>People with international experience tend to view the spector of disease more gravely. Randy Altman, a tea trade consultant from Pleasantville, in Westchester, said that he was reluctantly in favor of the spraying and feared that the United States was far behind other countries in understanding the full health risks of outbreaks like West Nile. ''The United States middle class feels it is immune from these insect-borne diseases,'' he said. ''They think it is a third world problem. And it is not.''</p>
        <p>Even when they took a position on the merits of insecticides, many people in the region conceded yesterday that they knew little about chemicals. Sharpening the blade of his lawn mower tractor outside his house in Chappaqua, Bob Lewis said he did not object to the spraying, since he had his property sprayed for insects anyway several times a year.</p>
        <p>Still, he said, ''I would welcome more concrete and specific information.'' His wife, Mary Helen Hendricks, said: ''We have to rely, to some extent, on the authorities. The question is, do they have enough information?''</p>
