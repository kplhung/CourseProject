        <p>Re ''Where Manners Still Matter'' (Op-Ed, July 15), by George B. Pyle:</p>
        <p>The woman who admonished Mr. Pyle by saying ''I remember a day when a gentleman would never wear his hat inside a building'' was mistaken. But he should have removed it anyway.</p>
        <p>As a collector of vintage clothing, I have researched this question. Until the 1960's, nearly every man wore a hat outdoors and was entitled to leave it on indoors in public places like hotel lobbies and train stations.</p>

        <p>As a collector of vintage clothing, I have researched this question. Until the 1960's, nearly every man wore a hat outdoors and was entitled to leave it on indoors in public places like hotel lobbies and train stations.</p>
        <p>In a restaurant, a man could wear his hat while standing and waiting for a table (that is, in the ''public'' area), but even the most informal coffee shop would have provided a hook or rack, if not a checkroom for it. So he was expected to remove it upon taking a seat.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Pyle, I enjoy wearing a Panama hat. But I place it on an empty chair while I'm eating.</p>
