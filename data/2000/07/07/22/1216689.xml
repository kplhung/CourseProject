        <p>Capping a case that exposed a large-scale caviar smuggling ring, a Maryland company, two of its officials and a third person pleaded guilty yesterday to federal fraud, smuggling and wildlife endangerment charges. The company agreed to pay a $10.4 million fine, which prosecutors described as the largest ever in a wildlife smuggling case.</p>
        <p>The guilty pleas, entered in Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md., followed a prolonged investigation of a sophisticated black-market operation. The inquiry ranged from the shores of the Caspian Sea and the Mississippi River to the first-class cabins of American Airlines jets and upscale food stores in Manhattan, Greenwich, Conn., and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The illicit operation was part of a continuing illegal trade in the eggs of sturgeon, huge bottom feeders that live a century or more and reproduce slowly, whose high-priced roe have made them a target of poachers.</p>
        <p>Part of the scheme, government officials said, was the illegal importing of roe from several Caspian Sea sturgeon species protected by an international conservation treaty. Another part, they said, entailed falsely representing roe from two American species -- the shovelnose sturgeon and the paddlefish -- as legally imported Sevruga caviar.</p>
        <p>The company that admitted guilt yesterday was U.S. Caviar &amp; Caviar, one of the largest caviar importers in the country. From 1995 to 1999, according to court records, the company channeled tons of illegally harvested fish eggs from the Caspian and other waters to its offices in Rockville, Md.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the roe was smuggled into the country in large containers and was repackaged in Rockville, where workers placed it in caviar tins that bore counterfeit labels, some with fake Russian health agency certification seals. In other cases, the labels, printed in Rockville, were shipped to the Middle East, where Kenfood Trading, another company involved in the operation, packaged some of the roe in caviar tins and sent them on to Rockville.</p>
        <p>In 1998 alone, the operation funneled more than 18 tons of sturgeon caviar from the Caspian. The quantity of roe smuggled from Russia by U.S. Caviar &amp; Caviar was so great that it exceeded the total that could be legally exported from the country under international treaties.</p>
        <p>The first hint of the operation came in December 1998, when an inspector for the Fish and Wildlife Service at Baltimore-Washington International Airport noticed something odd about the labels in a shipment of caviar tins: the labels were of the peel-off variety, said Thomas Healy, the senior inspector in the agency's Baltimore office, whereas genuine labels on Russian caviar are glued on.</p>
        <p>The three men who entered guilty pleas yesterday are Hossein Lolavar, 46, president of U.S. Caviar &amp; Caviar; Faye Briggs, 53, the company's sales manager; and Ken Noroozi, 42, president of Kenfood Trading, which handled some of the illegal trade through the United Arab Emirates. All three men face at least a year's imprisonment at sentencing.</p>
