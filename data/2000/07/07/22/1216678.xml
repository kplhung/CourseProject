        <p>Virginia Saurwein, who was the United Nations' top liaison official with nongovernmental organizations from 1975 until 1989, died July 9 in Erie, Pa. She was 71 and lived in South Salem, N.Y.</p>
        <p>She suffered a heart attack and a stroke in February, according to a former colleague.</p>
        <p>During Ms. Saurwein's tenure, nongovernmental organizations, known as N.G.O.'s, became increasingly influential at the United Nations in fields like the environment, international law, arms control and human rights. Though their political influence is marginal, such groups play a significant role in bringing social issues to the attention of member states.</p>
        <p>At the International Women's Year conference in Mexico City in 1975, Ms. Saurwein helped draft the first United Nations resolution on women's access to credit. Later she was a co-founder and board member of Women's World Banking, a global loan-guarantee organization. After the Mexico City conference, she became chief of the N.G.O. liaison unit in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social affairs, a post she held until her retirement.</p>
        <p>Early in her career Ms. Saurwein worked as a program director at the United Nations Association of the U.S.A. and at the Center for War/ Peace Studies. In 1970, the United Nations Development Program asked her to help create its N.G.O. liaison office, which she led for five years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Saurwein is survived by a brother, George Saurwein, of Erie.</p>
