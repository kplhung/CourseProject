      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Under the white tent, set high up on the beach here, six little boys held out their limbs with horror.</p>
        <p>''Get it off! Please, quick,'' said one.</p>
        <p>''Will it cause cancer?'' said another.</p>
        <p>''I'm never going swimming in there again,'' said a third.</p>
        <p>Lucille Nicol, wearing a bright green T-shirt and equipped with paper towels and a bottle of olive oil, did her best to calm them. ''Look, it comes right off,'' she said, rubbing, oiling and rubbing some more to take off the black stains that dotted their arms and legs.</p>
        <p>Amputation, she assured them, was not necessary.</p>
        <p>The boys did not crack a smile.</p>
        <p>The teams of ''green T-shirts'' at La Turballe are new this year, one of the measures the town has taken to help tourists feel better about going on the beaches. The teams have sand pails, soccer balls and rackets to distribute. They organize games for the children. But tucked in with the other gear is the olive oil and paper towels used to take No. 2 crude oil off when it washes up on the sand or when swimmers run into the strands of seaweed that it often clings to.</p>
        <p>Last December, more than 200 miles of the Brittany coast was drenched with thick crude oil when the tanker Erika, registered in Malta, broke up in stormy seas 65 miles off the coast here. A huge effort was made to clean the beaches in time for the tourist season. But in some of the villages like La Turballe the tar-like fuel keeps washing up. Only last week, a new slick oozed over the shoreline that stretches north from the harbor here, leaving the rocks glistening with black streaks and the sand contaminated with gooey globs.</p>
        <p>Some of the town's people say it almost doesn't matter because there are no tourists anyway. There is plenty of room to lay down a towel at the other beaches in La Turballe. The sun shines and the sea glistens, but only those who have houses here or prepaid vacations have returned this year. Some of the merchants say their business is off by as much as 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Jesse and Florence Gisalson say they believe they will go bankrupt in the fall. The restaurants right on the port in La Turballe say they are doing O.K., and the fast food restaurants that have catered to the soldiers sent in to clean up the beaches are having a better-than-usual season. But the Gisalsons' restaurant, in an old stone house tucked behind the port, hardly sees anyone these days.</p>
        <p>''Usually these streets are like a rock concert they are so crowded,'' Mr. Gisalson said. ''Look at them now; it's noon and there is no one here.''</p>
        <p>The little towns along the coast have for months been caught in a sort of moral quandary: to speak or not to speak about their problem.</p>
        <p>Some have railed at the government for not moving fast enough, for not offering merchants tax breaks and other aid. Promises have been made, they say, but the cash is not in hand. Others do not want to have their towns associated with the pollution and have chosen to keep a lower profile.</p>
        <p>The mayor of La Turballe, Rene Leroux, has been among the most outspoken, willingly showing journalists the damage the Erika has done. ''If we lied to our friends the tourists, then they would never come back,'' he said. ''This way at least we can hold on to the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leroux put out a pamphlet this year, marking out beaches that would be cleaned immediately and monitored daily. He hired 50 extra employees to act as a quick-response team under the town's own control,  and he set up the teams of green T-shirts. But halfway through the season, he has the air of a beaten man.</p>
        <p>''We are so tired here,'' he said. ''The season came in and we hardly noticed.''</p>
        <p>Since the breakup of the Erika, French officials have said they want to strengthen international shipping regulations to make sure that such an accident does not occur again. The Erika was an old boat showing signs of rust and poor maintenance when it split up during a storm on Dec. 12.</p>
        <p>Most of the spill, estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 tons, came from the forward half of the boat. The stern half of the boat, which sank about 5 miles away from the front half and is almost 400 feet under the surface,  contains another 12,000 to 15,000 more tons of oil.</p>
        <p>Teams of experts have begun trying to pump out the rest of the oil in the holds, but the project is several months behind schedule. Touring the area this month, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin promised that those who were financially hit by the spill would be compensated.</p>
        <p>But not everyone in La Turballe believes him. Jean-Luc Fardoit, the president of the local chamber of commerce, says many of the merchants are ''barely sleeping these days.'' Mr. Fardoit, who owns two shops that sell souvenirs and beach toys, cut his staff from 11 to 9 and then reduced everyone's hours by 25 percent. Still, he says, he has plenty of time to go for coffee.</p>
        <p>''We are Bretons and we will not let go,'' Mr. Fardoit said. ''But we are waiting to see how much help we get. It would have been nice to get a few more specifics.''</p>
        <p>The oil spill has not affected all the seaside towns in the same way. Some resorts, like La Baule, just a 20-minute drive from La Turballe, have hardly been affected. La Baule's beaches face south rather than west, and that has made all the difference.</p>
        <p>But along the rockier shore lines, the picture is bleak.</p>
        <p>In La Turballe this week, the closed beach was something of a tourist attraction. Visitors drove up to see what the pollution looked like and watched soldiers in white plastic suits, red gloves and green boots scraping the oil from the rocks with trowels. Some of the workers complained that their suits were hot and the trowels hardly efficient.</p>
        <p>Rene Guerin, who drives his camper here every summer from Rennes, said he did it again this year out of loyalty. ''This is where we come, and it wasn't a good time to abandon this town,'' he said. ''It will be all right in a couple of years. Nature will take over again. But it is hard to wait.''</p>
