        <p>''It's going to be a little dusty,'' Gov. George W. Bush announced as he walked toward a sport utility vehicle and set off down one of the chalky dirt roads that snake through his roughly 1,500-acre ranch near this blink-and-you've-missed-it town.</p>
        <p>He was not kidding. The wheels turned, the vehicle lurched forward and a thick, grimy powder filled the air, already heavy from the 100-degree heat. The cattle up ahead looked torpid and ornery. Mr. Bush looked happy and utterly relaxed.</p>

        <p>''It's going to be a little dusty,'' Gov. George W. Bush announced as he walked toward a sport utility vehicle and set off down one of the chalky dirt roads that snake through his roughly 1,500-acre ranch near this blink-and-you've-missed-it town.</p>
        <p>He was not kidding. The wheels turned, the vehicle lurched forward and a thick, grimy powder filled the air, already heavy from the 100-degree heat. The cattle up ahead looked torpid and ornery. Mr. Bush looked happy and utterly relaxed.</p>
        <p>Here it was: the Texas governor's idea of heaven. Not a cabin on Tahoe or a chalet in Vail but a remote patch of land without a remotely decent restaurant or hotel nearby. During the Republican primaries, Mr. Bush openly pined for it, telling an audience or two how eager he was to return. After he clinched the party's presidential nomination, he arranged his schedule so he could spend most weekends here, even though it meant advisers sometimes had to make the two-hour drive northwest from Austin to see him.</p>
        <p>Today he settled in for a long weekend during which he said he would finally reach perhaps the most important decision of his campaign: who would be his running mate. But first, he took a few hours to give  reporters a rare tour of what would be a kind of western White House if he wins the presidency.</p>
        <p>He did not pretend that he actually worked the land here.</p>
        <p>''I'm what you call a windshield rancher,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I get in my pickup and drive all over the place, ranching through the windshield.''</p>
        <p>That means he looks at the pretty scenery, and there is plenty: a river, a canyon, cliffs and oak trees so  gnarled that they look like illustrations from a spooky fantasy book. Deer and turkey roam the fields.</p>
        <p>But there is also plenty of relatively flat land with grass that looks desperate for some liquid refreshment. It is in no sense a conventional vacation or weekend home, and that is one of the reasons Mr. Bush likes it so much. It fits his vision of himself as a kind of rugged, simple man without finicky airs or fancy appetites, and it fits into his claim of being someone whose soul is rooted somewhere far from Washington.</p>
        <p>A house for the Bushes is under construction on the property, and as Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, walked reporters through the structure, the Texas governor said he had made few demands about the design.</p>
        <p>''I've asked for a king-sized bed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''And a good shower,'' Mrs. Bush added.</p>
        <p>''And a good shower,'' Mr. Bush agreed. ''That's about all that I care about.''</p>
        <p>At their side was the architect they had hired for the project, and the house that they modestly described as a three-bedroom ranch sprawled over perhaps 4,000 square feet, although it was impossible to know. The architect had been forbidden by the Bushes from providing the dimensions, just as he was not allowed to estimate how much the construction would cost.</p>
        <p>The tour that Mr. Bush gave today also reflected his diligent efforts over the last several months to forge a friendly, informal relationship with the press corps. He invited representatives of most of the nation's largest daily newspapers and all of the major television networks.</p>
        <p>Although he has conducted some campaign business here, the ranch is mainly the preferred refuge of a man who has vowed not to let himself get consumed by his political ambitions and has worn that pledge as a badge of honor.</p>
        <p>''You never forget you're running for president,'' Mr. Bush said, even on more than a thousand acres far from the madding crowd. ''But it gives me perspective. It gives me a lot of balance.''</p>
