        <p>At the summit meeting here of eight world leaders, where the focus was unremittingly on harmony, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Clinton on Friday night to argue against American deployment of a national missile shield.</p>
        <p>The two met during a break in the Group of 8 meeting under way here in Okinawa. National missile defense was the most attention-getting issue, because it exposed a rift in a well-scripted gathering.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton joined Mr. Putin in a casual setting, a private dining room overlooking a hotel pool. Mr. Clinton wore a tan suit and an exhausted look. Mr. Putin, in a dark blue suit, shook Mr. Clinton's hand vigorously for the photographers but offered no Boris Yeltsin-style bear hug.</p>
        <p>Flanked by aides, the two men spent 75 minutes discussing and disagreeing on security issues.</p>
        <p>Of the national missile defense system, a senior administration official said, ''President Clinton made clear, as he has publicly, that he has not made a decision, but he intends to make a decision during the course of this summer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin, who met recently with the leaders of China and North Korea to solidify opposition to the building of such a system, briefed Mr. Clinton on an offer by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, to scrap his missile program if other countries provide him with rockets to explore space. American officials have reacted with skepticism.</p>
        <p>''It's not entirely clear what is in Kim Jong Il's mind with regard to this possible trade-off,'' one official said. ''A very dangerous idea would be that the international community would provide actual launch capability to North Korea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin was not the only leader making the case against a United States missile shield. President Jacques Chirac of France, speaking to reporters, said the system might never work but nonetheless would prompt an arms race.</p>
        <p>''It's of a nature to retrigger a proliferation of weapons, notably nuclear missiles,'' Mr. Chirac said. ''Everything that goes in the direction of proliferation is a bad direction.'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany sided with the critics of the system, saying simply, ''I'm skeptical.''</p>
        <p>But such disagreement was rare. Common ground was what this annual meeting was all about. For instance, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Putin issued a statement saying they would set up a center for the exchange of data between systems that provide early warning in case of a missile launching.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the eight nations discussed other topics ranging from debt relief for developing nations and AIDS to oil prices and financial crime. ''We are deeply concerned about the growth of armed conflict in the continent of Africa,'' said one unanimous decree.</p>
        <p>Official events took place in a majestic seaside resort, the Cape Busena. Journalists, protesters and even top aides were stopped in their tracks at the front door. Few people with last names other than Clinton or Blair or Amato or Chirac or Chretien or Mori or Putin or Schroder could stroll easily through the metal detectors.</p>
        <p>All of the leaders seemed to be sweating, and plainly not because of the intensity of the meeting. Mr. Chirac was wiping his forehead in the heat as he stopped in the hotel lobby to admire Okinawan schoolchildren in traditional dress who were beating drums and singing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's schedule included the trivial, the serious and the in-between. This morning Mr. Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshiro Mori, sat down to discuss economic and foreign policy issues. Later, they planted a tree together.</p>
        <p>In the giant media centers set up in hotel ballrooms across the island to accommodate the thousands of reporters covering the meeting, ''officials,'' ''senior administration officials'' and some people actually willing to use their real names briefed them on everything from the volatility of oil prices to the illicit trade in  diamonds in Africa.</p>
        <p>''On the area of debt reduction, there was a very lengthy and very good exchange,'' Lael Brainard, Mr. Clinton's adviser on international economic issues, said on Friday.</p>
        <p>The Middle East also came up repeatedly, as leaders congratulated Mr. Clinton on his peacemaking efforts. He planned to remain here today, but his spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president might scale back his schedule on Sunday to hurry back to Camp David.</p>
        <p>Okinawa clearly was full of action, but Thomas S. Foley, the United States ambassador to Japan, staged a summit-related event Friday on a tinier island nearby. Reporters boarded a ferry to photograph Mr. Foley unveiling a plaque honoring the memory of Ernie Pyle, the celebrated war correspondent who died on Ie Shima during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.</p>
