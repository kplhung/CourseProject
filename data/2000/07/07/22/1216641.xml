        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Rats have as much right to be on this planet as we do (''Rat Fears,'' editorial, July 16). It is only when they bring defensive or aggressive behavior to bear on their own situation, and diseases to our species, that they threaten us, as they seem to today.</p>
        <p>I grew up in that magical period between abundant horse-drawn carriages and garbage disposal on the streets when visible rats were a rarity. Not until the 1970's did I see a rat on the street, when I was forced one evening to stop in my tracks as one crossed my path on its way to the river.</p>

        <p>I grew up in that magical period between abundant horse-drawn carriages and garbage disposal on the streets when visible rats were a rarity. Not until the 1970's did I see a rat on the street, when I was forced one evening to stop in my tracks as one crossed my path on its way to the river.</p>
        <p>I never saw a rat in the subway. Surely what kept them out was the fact that vast crews were employed to clean the tracks, cars and stations. Prevention may not be popular with politicians because it does not respond heroically to a perceived crisis. But the cleaning of the tracks, stations and the streets methodically and by hand could make a difference. We shouldn't have to look filth -- or rats -- in the face at 8 a.m. or any other time.</p>
