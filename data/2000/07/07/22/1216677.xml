        <p>Thomas J. Sardino, who as Syracuse's police chief strove to defuse demonstrations, disorders and racial tension in the early 1970's, died July 14 in Syracuse. He was 72 and lived in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press said.</p>
        <p>Chief Sardino headed his city's police from 1970 to 1985. In mid-August 1971, when Syracuse youth gangs were involved in a series of racial clashes, window breakings and fire-bombings, he sent police community relations teams and human relations experts to try to bring peace between the gangs, and the violence subsided.</p>
        <p>Early that month, after three nights of fire-bombing, Chief Sardino declared that ''citizens who feel their life and property are threatened by arsonists may use deadly force.''</p>
        <p>In 1970, when Vietnam War opponents, after protesting at Syracuse University, wanted to march through the city's streets, Chief Sardino gave his approval. But he stipulated that the march had to be well behaved -- and be led by him.</p>
        <p>In a 1990 interview, David Ifshin, who had been a Syracuse student leader in 1970, recalled Chief Sardino's ''patience and wisdom.''</p>
        <p>Chief Sardino wrote books about police work, including ''Crime Control Team'' (1971) and ''Police Crisis Intervention'' (1977).</p>
        <p>He was born in Syracuse, received degrees from Syracuse University and joined the Syracuse police force in 1953.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Nina, 5 children and 11 grandchildren.</p>
