        <p>LIKE ships that pass in the night, Jack Nicklaus was coming up the 18th fairway on the Old Course in the sunshine of applause from thousands of Scots yesterday as Tiger Woods strolled out of the Royal and Ancient clubhouse shortly before shooting 66 for a three-stroke lead halfway through the British Open.</p>
        <p>More golden than bearish now at 60, Nicklaus missed his birdie putt, tapped in and waved to the applause. With a one-over-par 73 after Thursday's 77 for 150, he missed the 36-hole cut in what will probably be his last ''favorite event,'' golf's oldest tournament that he had won three times.</p>

        <p>LIKE ships that pass in the night, Jack Nicklaus was coming up the 18th fairway on the Old Course in the sunshine of applause from thousands of Scots yesterday as Tiger Woods strolled out of the Royal and Ancient clubhouse shortly before shooting 66 for a three-stroke lead halfway through the British Open.</p>
        <p>More golden than bearish now at 60, Nicklaus missed his birdie putt, tapped in and waved to the applause. With a one-over-par 73 after Thursday's 77 for 150, he missed the 36-hole cut in what will probably be his last ''favorite event,'' golf's oldest tournament that he had won three times.</p>
        <p>''Walking over the Swilken Bridge is very nice,'' he was saying now, referring to when he stood and waved with his son Steve, his caddie. ''But not on Friday afternoon.''</p>
        <p>Not for the golfer who won a record 18 major titles. Not with the championship still to be decided today and tomorrow when Woods, at 24, will have the opportunity to dethrone Nicklaus as the youngest to complete the career Grand Slam. Nicklaus was 26 when he won the 1966 British Open to go with his United States Open, Masters and Professional Golfers Association Championship titles.</p>
        <p>''And the fact that Tiger is coming along doesn't bother me in the least,'' Nicklaus said. ''I'm kind of rooting for somebody to come along and if it's Tiger, that's fine. Or if it's somebody else to challenge that record of 18 majors or break it, or whatever. I think it would be good for the game of golf.</p>
        <p>''The game of golf needs a shot in the arm constantly. It always needs a shot in the arm. Some of the golf I've seen from this young man has been pretty phenomenal, and I think that he should get even better. And if he does, I'm going to be the first one there to tell him, 'Well done.' ''</p>
        <p>For all his power in his prime, Nicklaus seldom played golf as aggressively as Woods does now. Nicklaus believed in ''playing the way I thought it should be played -- for me.'' Meaning, in keeping with his conservative and managed manner, waiting for somebody else to lose a tournament rather than gambling to win it on what could be a disastrous shot.</p>
        <p>''I have not really watched Tiger play that much,'' he said, ''but every time I turn on the television set, he holes a putt. I turned on the television set seven or eight times in the U.S. Open and all I saw him doing was walking after a 30-footer and picking it out of the hole. When you putt like that, the game becomes awful easy.</p>
        <p>''I think mentally he is a very good player. But it's easy to have a good head on your shoulders when you don't worry about making anything from 15 feet in. You know you're going to make it, why worry about the problems? It's like I never worried about chipping because I never missed anything inside 10 feet anyway.''</p>
        <p>Nicklaus knows how Woods feels because at his best, he had the same confidence, especially on pressure putts, that Woods has now.</p>
        <p>''There were periods of time when I was doing exactly what he was doing,'' he said. ''Nothing matters because I'm going to knock it in anyway. When you get that, the game becomes easy. When you're struggling with the putter, it just goes right through the bag and it makes every other shot difficult.''</p>
        <p>Does Woods posses golf attributes that Nicklaus did not?</p>
        <p>''I haven't played enough golf with him to know what he has,'' Nicklaus said. ''I know he has a good mind. I know he drives a ball. I think we're fairly comparable off the tee. He's longer than I was because of equipment. He definitely has a better short game than I had. But I think we grew up differently. I was a big kid, and he was not a big kid. A lot of kids who are slight in stature have a very good short game because they need a very good short game, and now he has a big game but he's not going to forget the short game. I never had that opportunity. I'm the same size now I was at 13.''</p>
        <p>Did he think that some pros have mentally surrendered to Woods's dominance?</p>
        <p>''I liken that to when Arnold Palmer came along,'' he said. ''Arnold came along after Snead, Hogan and Nelson, all past their prime, and there was a five-, six-, seven-year gap when not much happened. Nobody dominated, then Arnold came along when the public needed somebody to dominate it. Then Gary came along, then I came along.</p>
        <p>''Right now I don't think there's anybody contending. There are a lot of very good players, don't get me wrong. I don't mean the players today can't play golf. Vijay Singh has won two majors, Ernie Els has won two. That would be the closest. I was playing Arnold, who won seven; Gary nine, Lee Trevino six, Tom Watson eight.</p>
        <p>''These guys had all learned to win major championships,'' he continued. ''I always had somebody who knew how to win, like I knew how to win, competing against me. Right now Tiger doesn't have that, but he will. He's certainly not going to get off the next 15 years with a free run. There are just too many good players coming along.</p>
        <p>''Tiger is good for the game, but he has to have challengers for the whole thing to be right. He has done some great things. He's the new kid on the block and he's a great player and he's going to get better. But he will have competition, too. You're finding that a lot of good athletes gravitate to golf now, which is only going to make it better.''</p>
