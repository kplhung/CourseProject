        <p>Wardell B. Pomeroy, one of Alfred Kinsey's associates in the 1940's, was interviewing a man about his first ejaculation. He asked, ''When?'' The man answered, ''Fourteen.'' Pomeroy then asked, ''How?'' and was surprised to hear: ''With a horse.''</p>
        <p>In his new biography, ''Sex the Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey,'' Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy records what happened next. Pomeroy asked the man, ''How often were you having intercourse with animals at 14?''</p>
        <p>The man looked confused and said, ''Well, yes, it is true I had intercourse with a pony at 14.'' Pomeroy, it turned out, had misheard the man's previous answer. It was ''with whores,'' not ''with a horse.'' So the man was stunned that Pomeroy had had the insight to ask him the horse question out of the blue.</p>
        <p>Sex surveyors are bedeviled scientists. Beyond the problems of hearing the respondents correctly and not making imaginative suggestions themselves, they face a number of obstacles. People lie about sex. Those who don't lie often say inaccurate things. And most sex researchers aren't exactly neutral.</p>
        <p>Two battling biographies of Kinsey, ''Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Man'' by James H. Jones, published in 1997, and Mr. Gathorne-Hardy's book have recently brought the issue of truth in sex into focus again. And this December a new book, ''Sex, Love and Health,'' further analyzing the results of the National Health and Social Life Survey on sex, will be published, raising the question again: how much can we really know about other people's sex lives?</p>
        <p>Sex surveys give ''a hardened imitation of reality,'' says John H. Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State University at Stony Brook who studies sex. Certain kinds of questions elicit certain answers, and certain questions are asked because of fear.</p>
        <p>If you look back at American sex surveys, Mr. Gagnon says, you can see that most are concerned with risk: the risk to marriage, the risk to virginity, the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, violence, teenage pregnancy and child abuse.</p>
        <p>The first sex survey published in the United States, according to Julia A. Ericksen's book ''Kiss and Tell: Surveying Sex in the 20th Century,'' was F. S. Brockman's study of adolescent boys around the turn of the century. College-age men were asked about their boyhoods: What was your severest temptation? Did you yield? The results were published in ''The Pedagogical Seminary,'' edited by G. Stanley Hall, a prominent psychologist who believed that masturbation depleted a man's energy. The study showed what was feared: young men were in spiritual crisis and masturbation was partly to blame.</p>
        <p>By 1916 concerns had changed. Walter Robie, a neurologist and advocate of birth control, was worried about premarital sex and venereal disease. He believed, Ms. Ericksen writes, that occasional ''autoerotism would help prevent nonmarital intercourse.'' His survey confirmed his belief that masturbation saves marriages.</p>
        <p>Later sex surveys were probably no less biased; it's just that the biases had changed. Mr. Jones writes in his biography that Kinsey's sex studies were an effort ''to help himself,'' that from childhood on Kinsey ''lived with two shameful secrets: he was both a homosexual and a masochist.'' He was determined, Mr. Jones writes, ''to strip human sexuality of its guilt and repression.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Jones says, the homosexual cases made up approximately one-fifth of the sample.'' And so Kinsey vastly overstated the incidence of homosexuality (10 percent for men).</p>
        <p>Mr. Gagnon takes a different slant on Kinsey's bias. What affected the data, he says, is that Kinsey's subjects were ''all white, Midwestern or Northeastern, young and highly educated.''</p>
        <p>The surveys that followed were even less representative: in the 1970's Shere Hite, the Cassandra of women's sex, was criticized for choosing a sample that included too many women who had emotional problems with men in the ''Hite Report on Female Sexuality.'' The sex surveys done by Redbook, Cosmopolitan and Playboy were based on the responses of readers, a self-selected group.</p>
        <p>But even if such biases are removed, will the whole truth out? Apparently even the sternest scientific studies -- mass surveys of randomly selected people, conducted by interviewers trained to look unbiased, unimpressed and unembarrassed -- are not beyond reproach.</p>
        <p>Six years ago the results of the National Health and Social Life Survey were published in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality'' by two sociologists, Edward O. Laumann and Mr. Gagnon; an economist, Robert T. Michael; and a researcher, Stuart Michaels. The study, which was motivated by the AIDS epidemic and was supposed to be publicly financed, ended up being paid for privately when the Senate, at the urging of Senator Jesse Helms, voted against support.</p>
        <p>Contrary to prurient expectations, the survey, based on interviews with a random sample of 3,432 people between 18 and 59, was a picture of sexual squareness: low rates of homosexuality and promiscuity, high rates of marital fidelity and connubial bliss. It showed that in a given year most Americans have only one sex partner; that the median lifetime number of partners for women is two and for men is six; that most people have sex less than twice a week and it's over quickly; that most Americans are happy with their sex lives and partners. It also showed that people most often have sex with members of their own class.</p>
        <p>This survey was to be the most representative and accurate ever. Indeed, the researchers took extreme precautions against lying. For potentially embarrassing questions, they had the respondents give written as well as oral answers. And only written answers were given for two questions the researchers considered the most sensitive: masturbation and household income.</p>
        <p>Despite the rigor, the study did not persuade everyone. In The New York Review of Books, Richard Lewontin, a population geneticist at Harvard, complained that the researchers still had no way of knowing how many people had lied. And even admirers of the study sounded disappointed. Paul Robinson, a history professor at Stanford University and the author of ''The Modernization of Sex,'' says that the survey ''had little resonance -- it didn't make much of a splash.''</p>
        <p>So where is the science of sex surveys now? In December ''Sex, Love and Health,'' an extension of the project begun in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality,'' will be published. In keeping with the concerns of the time, it will focus less on AIDS and more on teenage sex, race, class and gender, sex between adults and children, circumcision, sexual dysfunction and abortion.</p>
        <p>But something more basic is on the horizon. It appears that researchers are abandoning the dream of quantitative carnal knowledge. ''We are not in the truth business,'' Mr. Gagnon says. ''People tell us the truth as they see it.'' But they forget, and the stories they tell are altered by having told the story before, by storytelling conventions, by the audience and by the news media.</p>
        <p>Rachel Maines, the author of ''The Technology of Orgasm,'' says sex surveys won't tell you people's deepest, darkest secrets. But over time sex studies do show changes. For example, people used to say they disliked using condoms because it suggested premeditated sex, Ms. Maines says. Now they might say that they don't like them because of the loss of sensation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewontin wrote: ''The answer, surely, is to be less ambitious and stop trying to make sociology into a natural science. There are some things in the world that we will never know and many that we will never know exactly.''</p>
        <p>Such reduced expectations seem to have brought Kinsey new respect. Mr. Gathorne-Hardy's biography defends him by suggesting that he wasn't really out to find sex norms. Kinsey, who started off as a biologist specializing in the study of the gall wasp, was not so much a statistician as a taxonomist, someone who classified the variety of sexual behavior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gathorne-Hardy notes that Kinsey never asked ''have you or did you ever?'' but rather ''when did you first do something -- have intercourse with a woman, a man, an animal?'' By assuming that everyone had done everything, he encouraged people to talk. Kinsey got 18,000 people to reveal the ''details of sensitive matters like homosexuality, extramarital affairs, masturbation, child-adult sex and so on,'' Mr. Gathorne-Hardy writes.</p>
        <p>Kinsey's work ''probed the limits,'' Mr. Gagnon says. He was the first to break open the doors. In the tradition of American reformers, he believed that sexuality, if liberated, was redemptive.</p>
        <p>But do people read sex surveys for liberation? No, says Mr. Robinson. They ''want to know how many people are like me.''</p>
        <p>And for that ''people want absolute truth from science,'' Mr. Gagnon says. ''There is a desire for the gold standard, the real numbers.'' People want to know how they stack up. They don't want to hear stories about a boy and his horse.</p>
