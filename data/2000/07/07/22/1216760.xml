        <p>Dwight Gooden received his second pink slip of the season two months ago, this time from his hometown team, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Out of work, and seemingly out of options, the 35-year-old right-hander has since spun an improbable chance into the gritty beginnings of a revival tale.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully this will be my last chapter,'' Gooden said, smiling in pinstripes last night. ''I want this one to last me awhile.''</p>
        <p>Gooden surpassed expectations by winning his first start in his Yankee comeback, on July 8 against the Mets. Then he impressed in his second outing eight days later by helping the Yankees win out of the bullpen. Last night, he demonstrated that he has more weapons than just emotion on the mound.</p>
        <p>He has an improved off-speed arsenal, and last night he had an offense that wouldn't quit as well.</p>
        <p>Back starting in part because Orlando Hernandez is on the 15-day disabled list with mild inflammation in his right elbow, Gooden pitched six innings in front of 39,518 at Yankee Stadium, giving up eight hits and one run in leading the Yankees to an 11-1 drubbing of the Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Lifted by an attack that supplied 16 hits in the first six innings, Gooden earned his second victory in two starts for the first-place Yankees  (50-41). He has an earned run average of 2.20 since returning to the team for which he pitched a no-hitter four years ago.</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre put the brakes on the reinvention party, though. ''It's a little early,'' Torre said. But he was encouraged with Gooden's effort after the first inning, when he stayed ahead of the batters and finished with 61 strikes in 96 pitches.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy with what he's doing,'' Torre said. ''He's working at it. I think the experience helps and the more outings he has like these it's going to work for his confidence.''</p>
        <p>Once a pitcher with the Mets who stockpiled strikeouts by blowing pitches by batters with his 97-mile-an-hour fastball, Gooden has been relying on his off-speed pitches these days. He throws in the mid- to high-80's now, but unlike in the beginning of the season, when he struggled in Houston, and then Tampa Bay, Gooden is no longer falling behind batters. He has worked on a new off-speed pitch, a two-finger splitter, and uses it with mixed results to confuse batters.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest differences with Gooden now, though, is that he has Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and David Justice -- in that order. Jeter went 4 for 5, his four hits, all singles, tying a career high. Williams reached base in all five at-bats and went 3 for 3. Justice continued his torrid July, extending his hitting streak to nine games and collecting three runs batted in to spark the game-deciding rallies in the first and third.</p>
        <p>''That definitely makes it easier for the starting pitcher,'' Gooden said. And sweeter, too, since they helped him get the victory over the team that released him. ''It's mostly for bragging rights than anything personal,'' Gooden said. ''A lot of those guys live in St. Pete in the off-season. I think I've got the upper hand right now.''</p>
        <p>Larry Rothschild, the Devil Rays' manager, offered faint praise of his former starter, who went 2-3 in eight starts until May 25. ''He was all right, similar to what we saw when he was here,'' Rothschild said. ''He held us to one run through six innings. You have to give him credit.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, Gooden did not give himself credit warming up in the bullpen last night. ''I felt I had nothing; this was not the day for that to happen,'' he recalled.</p>
        <p>On the second pitch of the game, a slider, Gooden gave up a home run to Gerald Williams, the 17th home run Gooden has given up this season. After two quick outs, Gooden then loaded the bases, allowing two singles and a walk. But he escaped by getting Mike DiFelice to pop up to short center to end the threat and leave the Yankees behind by just 1-0.</p>
        <p>''That pop-up was big,'' Gooden said.</p>
        <p>But with two men on base and two outs in the third, DiFelice again flied out. ''That was the turning point for me,'' Gooden added.</p>
        <p>By the end of the inning, thanks to a rally ignited by Jeter, the Yankees had put Gooden ahead for good. Jeter started the first-inning rally with a single off Esteban Yan (4-7), extending his hitting streak to nine games. Paul O'Neill followed with a single, Williams walked and then Justice singled in two runs.</p>
        <p>After a scoreless second inning, Jeter started the third with a single. Williams doubled to center and Jeter sprinted home. Justice singled in Williams before Tino Martinez ended the scoring by grounding into a double play.</p>
        <p>In the fourth, Jorge Posada opened with a double to right, Jose Vizcaino singled him home and then Jeter's third single scored Vizcaino for a 6-1 lead. By the time Posada hit his two-run home run in the fifth inning, Gooden no longer had a cushion so much as he had a trampoline.</p>
        <p>If his changeups did not carry an ''I told you so'' spin against his former employers, Gooden seemed to send a message to his once and current employers: ''I can still pitch.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN said that ORLANDO HERNANDEZ did not have tests on his back yesterday, but would continue to rehabilitate in Tampa, Fla., along with RAMIRO MENDOZA. ''There's nothing wrong; it looks like things are progressing,'' Cashman said of Hernandez.</p>
