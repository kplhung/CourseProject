        <p>The Pentagon announced an ''anti-harassment action plan'' today that would require military commanders to discipline service members who engaged in, condoned or ignored anti-gay behavior.</p>
        <p>But the plan was short on details, and Carol DiBattiste, under secretary of the Air Force and head of the panel of civilian and military leaders that drafted the plan, acknowledged in a news conference that it was ''going to take some work'' to get the four military services to carry it out.</p>
        <p>Also today, the Army formally released its internal investigation into circumstances surrounding the murder of a gay private last summer, which found evidence of anti-gay remarks and harassment on the base where the murder occurred.</p>
        <p>The Defense Department's plan recommends training tailored to the specific rank of troops to implement the Clinton administration's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gay men and lesbians to serve in the military provided they keep their sexual orientation a secret and do not engage in homosexual acts.</p>
        <p>The plan is a response to a survey of 38 military bases and 11 warships that concluded that anti-gay remarks and harassment were commonplace in the American military, and that most service members believed their superiors and colleagues tolerated such behavior ''to some extent.''</p>
        <p>The survey, ordered after Pfc. Barry Winchell, a 21-year-old gay soldier, was bludgeoned to death last July in his barracks at Fort Campbell, Ky., suggested that disparaging and hostile attitudes toward gays remained pervasive in military culture.</p>
        <p>The Army investigation into the  murder provided more evidence of those attitudes. The investigation concluded that the ''command climate'' in his unit was ''poor,'' and admitted that ''joking and bantering'' on the base before his death could be viewed as harassment.</p>
        <p>The report found isolated incidents ''where leaders had subjected soldiers to derogatory name-calling'' and evidence of ''inappropriate cadence calls'' when soldiers led with derogatory marching chants.</p>
        <p>The report details specific incidents of harassment. For example, 21 of 568 soldiers interviewed during group sessions said that they had knowledge of verbal harassment of service members perceived as homosexuals. Half of those who observed such harassment said it was ''on a daily basis.'' The bulk of the harassment was in a work area or in formation during duty hours.</p>
        <p>Despite the evidence of anti-gay behavior, the report exonerated all officers of blame in the murder of Private Winchell and concluded that there was no general climate of homophobia at the base, home of the 101st Airborne Division.</p>
        <p>''It was determined that the command climate at Fort Campbell'' before the murder was ''a positive environment,'' with some exceptions, the inspector general's report said.</p>
        <p>The report showed that the Army had failed to educate service personnel about the policy. Except for first sergeants, noncommissioned officers could not recall any training on the policy toward gays during any officer development course, the report said. Less than 5 percent of commanders, command sergeant majors and leaders interviewed said that they had received training on the policy in their units.</p>
        <p>''The task force was unable to confirm a single occasion where unit training was ever conducted on the policy at Fort Campbell'' prior to the murder of Private Winchell, the report said. Half of the soldiers interviewed said they did not fully understand the policy.</p>
        <p>''If that is not a lack of leadership, I don't know what is,'' said Michelle M. Benecke, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that provides legal aid to gays in the military.</p>
        <p>Although the sergeant who was Private Winchell's immediate superior was accused in the report of ''abusive'' behavior, stripped of his leadership position and reassigned, no criminal charges have been filed against him. Asked repeatedly whether the sergeant was under criminal investigation, the Army chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, said only that such a decision was in the hands of the base.</p>
        <p>Commenting on an accusation by Patricia Kutteles, Private Winchell's mother, that the Army was covering up a gay-bashing atmosphere on the base, General Shinseki said, ''I will tell you this, if this were a cover-up I wouldn't be standing here today.''</p>
        <p>The killing of Private Winchell as he slept renewed the debate over the Clinton administration's policy on gays, and the issue has permeated the presidential campaign. Vice President Al Gore vows to allow gays to serve openly. His Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, supports the existing policy.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has described the policy, which he instituted in the first year of his presidency, as ''out of whack.'' But when asked today if he agreed with the president's description, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness, Bernard D. Rostker, said: ''I don't agree with that characterization. I think the policy is working reasonably well to provide a degree of safety for those who want to serve in the military regardless of sexual orientation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DiBattiste described the process by which a service member has to report anti-gay harassment and the commanding officer has to respond. The service member must report the details of the harassment, but not whether he or she is gay; his or her superior must elicit the details without asking the alleged victim whether he or she is gay.</p>
