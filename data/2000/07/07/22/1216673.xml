        <p>For years, Li Ka-shing has foraged in the darker corners of the telecommunications industry. A paging service in Australia, an upstart mobile-phone operation in Britain, a little-known provider of personal communications services in Bellevue, Wash.</p>
        <p>Now that last company, VoiceStream Wireless, is weighing a $53 billion takeover bid from Deutsche Telekom. And Mr. Li, a Hong Kong multibillionaire for whom the phrase ''Midas touch'' seems almost inadequate, may have found gold in another dark corner.</p>
        <p>If Deutsche Telekom acquires VoiceStream for the price being floated, the 23 percent stake owned by Mr. Li's company, Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., would be worth nearly $12 billion. That is 10 times the $1.2 billion Hutchison has invested in VoiceStream since late 1997.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely amazing,'' said Sanjeet Devgan, the head of Hong Kong research at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''But this management team has done it time and again.''</p>
        <p>Last November, Mr. Li reaped a $22 billion profit in a two-stage payday -- selling Hutchison's British mobile-phone company, Orange, to Mannesmann of Germany for stock and then watching those shares soar as Vodafone AirTouch of Britain waged and won history's largest takeover battle, for Mannesmann.</p>
        <p>Analysts had criticized Mr. Li for the Orange and VoiceStream investments, saying the price of entry was high and the technology unproven. But in both cases Mr. Li correctly foretold the market. Hutchison wound up owning assets that the titans of the telecommunications industry felt they could not live without.</p>
        <p>The Hong Kong financier and his Hutchison associates are ''comfortable taking calculated risks in industries they understand,'' said Tim Dattels, the head of investment banking in Asia for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, who has advised Mr. Li on several deals.</p>
        <p>''They make very quick decisions,'' Mr. Dattels said, ''and they're not sentimental about selling assets.''</p>
        <p>Unlike AT&amp;T, Vodafone or Deutsche Telekom, Hutchison does not aspire to build a global telecommunications empire. It is driven to wring the highest returns from its investments in the least amount of time. If Deutsche Telekom were to buy out Hutchison's stake in Voice Stream, analysts said Mr. Li would happily forsake the United States market after less than three years.</p>
        <p>''Their strategy is to buy early, build the network to a certain extent and, when the market values are peaking, sell out,'' Mr. Devgan said.</p>
        <p>Analysts cautioned that Deutsche Telekom's bid for VoiceStream could founder for several reasons, not least cold feet on the part of the German company's board. But if the deal unravels, the giant Japanese mobile phone operator NTT DoCoMo is said to be contemplating an offer.</p>
        <p>As in the Mannesmann-Vodafone battle, Mr. Li's hand will weigh heavily on the scales. In addition to its 23 percent stake, Hutchison has five directors on VoiceStream's board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Devgan calculated that Deutsche Telekom's offer would value VoiceStream at more than $15,000 per subscriber. That compares with the $10,000 per subscriber that Hutchison got for Orange. And it is more than double the per-subscriber valuations of most publicly traded mobile-phone companies.</p>
        <p>Such numbers would appeal to Mr. Li, 71, who immigrated to Hong Kong from neighboring Guangdong Province in the 1950's and got his start selling plastic flowers. Mr. Li soon graduated to property development, and in 1980, he made a run at Hutchison Whampoa. It was a milestone: Mr. Li was the first Chinese businessman to control one of the great colonial hongs, or trading companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li did not change the wheeler-dealer culture of Hutchison -- only its scale and geography. Where once Hutchison ran docks and ships in this former British colony, it now runs ports in the Panama Canal, an oil company in Canada and mobile-phone networks in Europe and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Hutchison paid $6.7 billion for a license to offer next-generation cellular services in Britain. Analysts shook their heads at the lofty price-tag. But a few months later, the company recouped more than half its investment by selling a 35 percent stake in its European mobile venture for $3.15 billion to NTT DoCoMo and Royal KPN, the Dutch mobile-phone operator.</p>
        <p>Hutchison's goal of offering Europewide mobile service will not be cheap. The European subsidiary, Hutchison 3G, must obtain licenses in Germany, France and Belgium in addition to building the network. Analysts estimate that Hutchison's share of the costs could reach $10 billion.</p>
        <p>''It may lead to their downfall because they are getting carried away bidding for 3G licenses in Europe,'' said one analyst, who, like most here, requested anonymity when commenting on Hutchison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Li's recent European deal bore another hallmark of his operating style: the use of partners to spread risk and provide an exit strategy. In the case of VoiceStream Wireless, people who know Mr. Li said he was attracted by the company's founder and chief executive, John Stanton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanton, who helped start McCaw Cellular, built VoiceStream by stitching together wireless licenses and buying his two principal rivals, Aerial and Omnipoint. It was a hard slog: cellular stocks, particularly those of personal communications services companies, were languishing.</p>
        <p>One day two years ago, Mr. Stanton traveled to Calgary, Alberta, to meet with Mr. Li's chief deputy, Canning Fok, and discuss Hutchison's investment in VoiceStream. People who recall the meeting said Voice Stream's stock hit an all-time low that day. But Mr. Fok was undeterred. Hutchison had invested millions of dollars, and endured heavy losses, before Orange turned a corner in Britain.</p>
        <p>Today, VoiceStream is an alluring prospect to globally minded telephone companies like Deutsche Telekom. It is one of the few independent cellular operators in the United States. And its digital network uses GSM technology that is compatible with the network operated by Deutsche Telekom in Germany.</p>
        <p>Last year, another German company needed a similar wireless asset to fulfill its ambitions. That company, Mannesmann, paid Mr. Li $14 billion for Hutchison's controlling stake in Orange.</p>
