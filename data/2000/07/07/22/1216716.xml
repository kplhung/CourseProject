        <p>Police Commissioner Howard Safir said yesterday that investigators were reviewing why five New York City police officers from the same Queens precinct had written thousands of parking tickets that were later dismissed with unusual regularity.</p>
        <p>About 6,000 tickets written by the five officers from the 110th Precinct, or nearly half the total summonses they issued in a year, were dismissed by administrative law judges.</p>
        <p>During the 12-month period that ended in June, judges dismissed 56 percent of the 4,000 tickets written by one officer in the precinct, which covers Elmhurst and Corona. His dismissal rate was the highest in the city. Four other officers from that precinct had dismissal rates greater than 40 percent, officials said.</p>
        <p>On average, about 6 percent of the 8 million tickets issued each year in the city are dismissed, officials said.</p>
        <p>The high number of dismissals revived a longstanding debate over whether police officers have ticket quotas, which might spur officers to write many invalid summonses. Union leaders have called ticket quotas an unspoken fact of police life. Police commanders have long denied their existence.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Safir reiterated that denial but was at a loss to explain the high incidence of dismissals, first reported by WNBC-TV.</p>
        <p>''I have asked our inspections unit to look into it to see what the problem is,'' Mr. Safir said.</p>
        <p>The investigators will review the reasons for the dismissals and will interview the officers, who were all assigned to ticket-writing patrols. Officials said they would not identify the officers unless they were found guilty of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said he was starting his own inquiry. ''Believe me, if there is any kind of quota system going on, we'll find out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>About 493,000 summonses are dismissed a year, officials said. Some are dismissed because they were filled out incorrectly, others because they were issued in error or to vehicles, like stolen cars, not in the possession of their owners when the parking violations occurred.</p>
        <p>Rose Rothschild, district manager of Community Board 4 in Elmhurst, said she had not received any complaints of overzealous ticket-writing.</p>
