        <p>Making another move to expand outside South Africa, Anglo American P.L.C., the world's biggest mining company, announced today that it had offered $1.8 billion to take over the Australian iron miner North Ltd.</p>
        <p>Anglo's offer of 4.20 Australian dollars a share, or $2.45, and the assumption of $263 million in debt is 11 percent higher than an offer made last month by Rio Tinto, which was expected to sweeten its bid.</p>
        <p>North is the world's fourth-largest producer of iron ore and is a major supplier to Asia, where demand has been strong and where Anglo has been trying to position itself as prime distributor of metals and minerals.</p>
        <p>With limited prospects for growth in Africa, Anglo has been looking outside of South Africa for opportunities to expand, and Australia has been one of its favorite targets. Last month, Anglo acquired several Australian coal mines, and last year, the company acquired a 23 percent stake in an Australian nickel-mining house.</p>
        <p>Anglo's latest offer also underscores the changing corporate focus of the company, which had evolved into an array of assets across many industries. Since shifting its primary listing to London last year, the company has been focusing on mining and shedding unrelated interests.</p>
        <p>The bid for North is another step in that strategy. Anglo, which bought  six million shares in North several weeks ago, said today that it had been evaluating the Australian company as a possible acquisition for some time and circumstances were now right to make a move.</p>
        <p>''The expansion of our mining and natural resources operations and the application of our mining expertise across commodities where we can add value are key elements of Anglo American's growth strategy,'' the company's chief executive, Tony Trahar, said in a statement.</p>
        <p>North's board indicated that it supported Anglo's approach, and the Australian company's major customers in Japan are said to support it as well. Anglo is the largest producer of gold and platinum. Securing a bigger stake in base metals has been an important objective for the company, said Mannie Rahn, who tracks the mining industry for Standard Equities in Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>Even with such a large acquisition, more than half of Anglo's assets would still be in South Africa, the company said. That makes it certain that Anglo will make other acquisitions overseas, Mr. Rahn said.</p>
        <p>''I think they would be loath to make any other investments in southern Africa,'' he said. ''If they have a choice, they would much rather go somewhere else. They still see South Africa as a very large part of their portfolio, and they want to diversify.''</p>
