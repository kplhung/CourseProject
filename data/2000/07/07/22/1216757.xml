        <p>The Mets and the Cincinnati Reds have agreed on a deal to send Barry Larkin, an 11-time All-Star shortstop, to New York. Larkin must now decide if he will accept a trade from the only team he has played for.</p>
        <p>After Larkin told Cincinnati reporters today that he had been approached by Reds General Manager Jim Bowden about accepting a deal to the Mets, the Mets' general manager, Steve Phillips, acknowledged that he had made the deal before the Mets lost, 6-3, to the Braves tonight at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>Starting Saturday afternoon, the Mets will have 72 hours in which to convince Larkin to join them. Phillips plans to speak with Larkin's agent, Eric Goldschmidt, and with Larkin, and said he was prepared to fly to Cincinnati if needed.</p>
        <p>Catcher Mike Piazza, Manager Bobby Valentine and other Mets said they also hoped to speak with Larkin.</p>
        <p>''We all know what he can do,'' Piazza  said of Larkin. ''He has a unique ability, those intangibles that he brings, a veteran presence on a ballclub who really can help us in many ways.''</p>
        <p>As far as helping to recruit Larkin, Piazza said: ''Does 1-800-FLOWERS deliver on the weekend?''</p>
        <p>Phillips refused to say which players he had given up, but the Mets' top prospect, the 21-year-old outfielder Alex Escobar, was in the lineup for Class AA Binghamton tonight. Other top prospects, the starting pitcher Grant Roberts, outfielder Jason Tyner and infielder Jorge Toca, all played tonight for Class AAA Norfolk.</p>
        <p>If those players are in the deal, they will not be playing for their teams once the 72-hour negotiating period begins.</p>
        <p>Last week Larkin said he was not a hired gun, and after speaking with Larkin by telephone this week, Mets infielder Lenny Harris, a close friend, came away believing that Larkin would insist on a contract extension.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't feel he's in that renting situation,'' Harris said on Wednesday. ''I know he doesn't want to come here or anywhere else to visit for two months.''</p>
        <p>After the game, Harris tried to call Larkin from his cell phone but could not reach him.</p>
        <p>''It would be good to play with him again,'' Harris said, ''but Barry's got to do what's good for Barry.''</p>
        <p>If Larkin wants an extension, that could be a problem for the Mets, who owe Rey Ordonez $16 million over the next three years and appear poised to make a pitch for the free-agent shortstop Alex Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners during the off-season. Ordonez is out for the season with a broken left forearm.</p>
        <p>''You have a shortstop for the future, so it means you're looking for somebody to get you through this year,'' Phillips said before tonight's game. After he announced the trade during the first inning, Phillips said that Ordonez's contract would be a ''complicating factor,'' and that this move ''doesn't affect any long-term decisions at all, right now.''</p>
        <p>Larkin, 36, who has been with the Reds since making his debut in 1986, had asked Cincinnati for a three-year contract extension worth about $28 million. The Reds balked, and after Larkin met on Tuesday with John Allen, the Reds' chief operating officer, he said he felt the Reds had no intention of bringing him back.</p>
        <p>The Mets and Reds agreed on a deal Thursday afternoon, prompting Bowden to fly to Houston, where the Reds were playing the Astros. Bowden met with Larkin for eight minutes, and Larkin left the meeting when Bowden would not reveal the players the Mets would send the Reds in return.</p>
        <p>''I won't even tell you the response I got,'' Larkin said. ''That's when I left.''</p>
        <p>Because he has at least 10 years in the majors and the last five with the same team, Larkin must approve any deal. There may still be hope that he will stay in Cincinnati, where he said he wanted to finish his career. Reds center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. -- who declined a potential deal to the Mets last winter -- has offered to defer salary to help the Reds sign Larkin, who can be a free agent after this season.</p>
        <p>''Junior is not trying to tell anybody what they're worth or what they should sign for,'' said Griffey's agent, Brian Goldberg. ''All he's saying and offering is, should the two sides want to make a deal, compromise some and there is still some gap to be bridged, he'll help bridge the gap.''</p>
        <p>Goldschmidt did not return several calls seeking comment, although he said on Thursday that Larkin would not necessarily insist on a contract extension before accepting a trade.</p>
        <p>''He's going to evaluate any situation that's put in front of him and make a decision on his future based on all the circumstances,'' Goldschmidt said.</p>
        <p>For the Mets, Larkin would be a substantial improvement over Melvin Mora, who has filled in adequately but began the second half of the season with a 3-for-26 slump. Some in the organization believe Mora, who is hitting .260 in his first full season, is better suited to be role player. As starting shortstops go, Larkin, who is  hitting .324 with 10 home runs and 34 runs batted, is considered the best in the National League.</p>
        <p>''Melvin has done an admirable job for us at shortstop,'' Phillips said. ''But Barry Larkin was the National League's starting All-Star shortstop and he'd fit what we are trying to add, which is a significant improvement over what we have.''</p>
