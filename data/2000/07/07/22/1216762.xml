        <p>Melvin Mora stood in the Mets' dugout at Turner Field before tonight's game and said he was not concerned with rumors that he would soon be replaced as the Mets' starting shortstop.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I know,'' he said, ''is they need me out there at shortstop and I'm going to try to do my best.''</p>
        <p>With two outs in the ninth inning, Mora gave the Mets his best, surprising the Atlanta Braves with a bunt and reaching safely on a single. But Mora's best was not enough in a 6-3 loss, and the Mets have decided it is also insufficient to sustain them through the pennant race.</p>
        <p>Mets players learned moments before the game that Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin, a potential Hall of Famer, can become a Met if he approves a trade. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine knew of the deal, but he was not happy that news of it broke between the end of the national anthem and the game's first pitch.</p>
        <p>Valentine did not think his players were affected, but he said the situation was weird. ''If I had a choice,'' he said, ''it'd be right now, and if he was our player, he'd be in uniform right now.''</p>
        <p>Valentine's urgency was understandable. The Mets had just fallen six games behind Atlanta in the National League East, and they are without three starting infielders because of injuries.</p>
        <p>Shortstop Rey Ordonez is out for the year with a broken left arm, third baseman Robin Ventura is on the disabled list with a bruised right rotator cuff and second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo missed the game with a sore right hip. Alfonzo received an anti-inflammatory injection before the game, which should make him available by Sunday.</p>
        <p>To make things worse, the Mets are playing in the park where their playoff hopes fizzled in 1998 and their World Series dreams died last October. Including the playoffs, the Mets have won just one of their last 16 games at Turner Field.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of scary to think of the numbers that are here, in terms of wins and losses,'' said Al Leiter, the Mets' starting pitcher tonight. ''I don't know what they are, but I know they're not good.''</p>
        <p>The park has been most inhospitable to Leiter. Including his start in the decisive sixth game of last year's National League Championship Series, when he allowed five earned runs and did not retire a batter, Leiter has given up 16 earned runs in 16 1/3 innings at Turner Field, for an 8.82 earned run average.</p>
        <p>Leiter (10-4) worked six innings tonight, allowing five runs and six hits. He dropped his third decision in a row since beating the Braves at Shea Stadium on July 1.</p>
        <p>Leiter allowed singles to the first two hitters he faced, Rafael Furcal and Andruw Jones, and they executed a double steal as Chipper Jones struck out. Brian Jordan followed with a single to center, scoring two runs -- including one by Andruw Jones, who overslid the lunging Mike Piazza before scrambling back to touch the plate with his foot.</p>
        <p>The Mets used four singles and a walk by Terry Mulholland to take a 3-2 lead in the third. John Burkett relieved Mulholland and got Mora to fly out with the bases loaded to end the inning. Once the Braves got Burkett a lead in the bottom of the inning, he cruised.</p>
        <p>The right-hander, who was bumped from the rotation when the Braves traded for Andy Ashby, allowed one hit in four and a third scoreless innings, winning for the first time since he beat the Mets on June 29.</p>
        <p>The Braves got their lead when a decision by Lenny Harris, who was filling in for Ventura at third, proved costly. With runners on second and third, Harris fielded Jordan's grounder and threw to Piazza at the plate. The throw pulled Piazza into the path of the base runner, Andruw Jones, who scored as the ball got away. Harris was given a throwing error, which allowed the runners to advance a base.</p>
        <p>Piazza had a slight case of whiplash but said he would probably be able to play on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The score was tied, 3-3, and Andres Galarraga grounded to shortstop, bringing in Chipper Jones to give Atlanta the lead.</p>
        <p>By the time Mora came up in the ninth, the Braves had added two runs to go up by three. Mora was stranded on first when Harris popped out to end the game. Mora had to admit that the Mets could use Larkin.</p>
        <p>''He can hit the ball to all fields, play defense, run -- he can do it all,'' Mora said of his possible successor. ''If this is what the team needs, it will be fine. Hopefully, it can help us go to the World Series.''</p>
        <p>Of course, if the Mets must go through Atlanta to get there, even Larkin might not be enough to save them.</p>
