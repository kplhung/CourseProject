        <p>In ''Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story,'' Anne Shirley makes her way to a publishing house in New York to peddle a manuscript. It's 1915, but her meeting with the company's head would sound familiar today. After complaining about the sorry state of the business, he compliments her work and then rejects it.</p>
        <p>He does give her a job as an editor and tells her what kind of book he wants to publish. With the war in Europe diverting the attention of men, he says, he wants stories that will appeal to women, but they should be adventure stories.</p>
        <p>It seems that the creators of this two-part mini-series, which presents the famous red-haired orphan girl as an adult, have taken the publisher's advice to heart. They have catapulted their heroine into the thick of all kinds of adventures that merely include engagement and marriage to her longtime beau, Gilbert Blythe, a romantic triangle, publishing intrigue, espionage and war.</p>
        <p>Clearly Anne has gone a long way from Avonlea, the Canadian setting of ''Anne of Green Gables,'' a book that remains on sixth-grade reading lists almost a century after it was first published. The book was made into a silent film in 1919. A 1934 version starred an actress named Dawn O'Day, who changed her name professionally to Anne Shirley after the character she played.</p>
        <p>Megan Follows has resisted that temptation, though she began playing Anne in 1985, when she was 16, in the television mini-series that would become a popular video Cliff's Notes for young readers, and again in a 1987 sequel. ''The Continuing Story'' completes the trilogy.</p>
        <p>Though also the work of Kevin Sullivan, who created this handsomely produced Canadian series, ''The Continuing Story'' differs significantly from the first two parts. While those productions took some liberties, particularly with time (placing Anne in the early 1900's instead of the 1880's), they faithfully remained connected to the books by Lucy Maud Montgomery. For this installment the dramatists have gone off into dangerous territory, to create what Mr. Sullivan has described as ''a completely original story.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan, who wrote the script with Laurie Pearson, has developed a plausible adult version of Anne, the shrewd, plucky orphan who had to win the hearts of the elderly couple with whom she had gone to live. They were Matthew and Marilla, a brother and sister who lived together on a farm called Green Gables and who were hoping for a boy to help with the chores. Now Matthew and Marilla are gone, though Anne remains shrewd and plucky, ready to conquer all obstacles the way she conquered Matthew and Marilla's hearts.</p>
        <p>But separated from her source material, Ms. Montgomery's books, Anne has also lost much of her childhood poetry. She no longer says things like ''my life is a perfect graveyard of burned hopes now'' with the same charm. Nor could she. She has grown up, and so has Ms. Follows, but the filmmakers haven't found a comparable way for her to express her adult longings and fears.</p>
        <p>They have replaced Anne's filigreed musings with action. As the mini-series opens, she is returning to Green Gables from a five-year stint away, working with orphans. But she arrives only to find that the place she once described as ''a beautiful dream'' is run down and occupied by trashy people.</p>
        <p>Though she says she wants to return there when she has children, she leaves for New York with her fiance, Gil (again played by Jonathan Crombie), who has been invited to work as a surgeon at Bellevue Hospital. Soon enough they both become disillusioned with the politics and perfidy of the city's institutions, medical and publishing, and head back home.</p>
        <p>But before returning to Canada, Anne becomes entangled -- professionally on her part, and also romantically on his -- with a famous writer of adventure stories, Jack Garrison Jr. (Cameron Daddo). Then everyone becomes engulfed in World War I, and so does the mini-series. Anne forges through the hugger-mugger with aplomb, relentlessly unflappable in the face of battlefront explosions, remarkable coincidences and neck-wrenching plot twists. She even disguises herself as a nun to cross enemy lines.</p>
        <p>''Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story'' is clunky at times. The actors are good but too restrained, unable to swell to the scenario's melodramatic proportions (though the music has no such problems). But it is engrossing all the same, especially for those who feel as if they knew Anne as a girl and want to see what happens to her when she grows up.</p>
