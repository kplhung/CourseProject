        <p>Editorial praises Metropolitan Transportation Authority's effort to cool New York City subway platforms</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If you stand on the subway platform at Grand Central you will hear a vague, rumbling hum, but not from the number 6 train snaking around the corner. If you stand in just the right place, you will feel a cool draft, but not from the street. The source of both the noise and the cool air is a series of impressively large black boxes suspended from the ceiling over the middle of the platforms. These are air coolers, and at Grand Central they are making the platform more bearable. While the new technology has not totally solved the heat problem, and so far has not confronted anything like last summer's stifling humidity, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority deserves thanks for giving its long-suffering passengers a measure of relief.</p>
        <p>The tropical conditions on the platforms are largely caused by heat released from the trains' air-conditioning and from acceleration and braking. The new machines blow cool air, partly by tapping into a refrigeration system already in place at Grand Central Terminal. Subway riders who stand directly under the units can enjoy a continuous stream of cool air, while those who stand a few feet away get somewhat less relief.</p>

        <p>The tropical conditions on the platforms are largely caused by heat released from the trains' air-conditioning and from acceleration and braking. The new machines blow cool air, partly by tapping into a refrigeration system already in place at Grand Central Terminal. Subway riders who stand directly under the units can enjoy a continuous stream of cool air, while those who stand a few feet away get somewhat less relief.</p>
        <p>At the Union Square station, 32 ceiling fans have also been installed as part of another pilot program. These are less successful because they simply recirculate hot air and stir up dust.</p>
        <p>The new systems carry a hefty price tag. The 43 air coolers at Grand Central cost $10 million, and the Union Square fans $1 million. However, despite structural shortcomings and costs, the M.T.A. should keep moving ahead. The systems may be far from perfect, but they can guide the development of better projects at other stations.</p>
        <p>There may be other ways to reduce heat. The agency has committed $17 billion to capital improvement. The M.T.A. will buy new rail cars that may better absorb energy during braking, reducing the heat the trains create now. With not only the comfort but the health of four million passengers at issue, these outlays make good sense.</p>
