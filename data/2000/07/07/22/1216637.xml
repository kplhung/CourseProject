        <p>When she first heard about it, Deborah Lipstadt believed that David Irving's threatened libel suit would be little more than a fleeting inconvenience.</p>
        <p>''I thought, 'This is a classic nuisance suit,' '' said Ms. Lipstadt, the author of ''Denying the Holocaust,'' which portrays Mr. Irving as a Holocaust denier who manipulates history to further his own agenda. ''I thought there would be a few lawyers' letters, and then it would go away.''</p>
        <p>But it didn't go away. Five years later, Ms. Lipstadt, a professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, won a drawn-out court case along with her publisher, Penguin Books, but only after spending more than $3 million and enlisting a formidable army of experts who had to prove that what she had said about Mr. Irving was true. The victory left Ms. Lipstadt with an unusually personal understanding of the vagaries of English libel law.</p>
        <p>In the United States, with its ironclad belief in the First Amendment right to free speech, libel plaintiffs like Mr. Irving need to prove not only that the speech in question is false, but also that it was published with a reckless disregard for the truth. In England, the burden is in exactly the other direction: the offending speech is presumed to be false, and it is up to defendants like Ms. Lipstadt to prove that it is in fact true.</p>
        <p>That may sound reasonable, but it can be prohibitively difficult, said Helena Peacock, the legal director of Penguin Books in Britain. ''Quite often, things are true, but it's very hard to provide evidence in court that shows they're true,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As a result, the British system tends to have a dampening effect on what newspapers print and what publishers include in books, especially when the material is likely to offend someone who is powerful, rich or particularly litigious. ''A lot of journalists feel very strongly that the libel laws support the very people they are traditionally supposed to call to account -- those in authority,'' said Bob Jones, an emeritus fellow in journalism at City University in London. ''In a profit-oriented, highly competitive media industry, managements are not too keen on taking risks when it comes to powerful people, because they know how expensive it is.''</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for the difference in laws is that England has never held free speech in as high esteem as the United States has; English courts have tended to regard it as subordinate to things like reputation, for instance. ''It's all connected with the English culture of deference,'' said Eric Barendt, a professor of media law at University College London.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, because of its plaintiff-friendly libel laws, London is not-so-affectionately known among lawyers as ''a town called Sue.'' ''We're becoming the libel capital of the world,'' said Mark Stephens, a lawyer specializing in free speech cases here. ''The U.K. is probably the best plaintiff jurisdiction anywhere, and as a consequence we get increasingly sophisticated plaintiffs looking at which country is best to sue in and being increasingly attracted to the U.K.''</p>
        <p>A recent ruling by the House of Lords, which serves as England's court of last resort, has not helped. The case concerned the effort of a high-profile Russian politician and businessman, Boris Berezovsky, to bring a libel suit against Forbes, the American magazine, in England. A 1996 Forbes article said that Mr. Berezovsky was followed by ''a trail of corpses, uncollectible debts and competitors terrified for their lives.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Forbes argued that since the case involved a Russian citizen and an American publication with a circulation in England of less than 2,000, it had nothing to do with England. When a lower-court judge agreed, Mr. Berezovosky appealed to the House of Lords and won.</p>
        <p>Forbes plans to bring up the matter with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, whose decisions can overrule even those of the House of Lords. But if the case ends up going to trial, Forbes will be put in a highly awkward position.</p>
        <p>''One will have to ship a sizable number of members of the Russian underworld here to testify,'' said David Hooper, a lawyer on Forbes's English legal team. ''The whole thing is ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>When they do find themselves sued in English courts, American publications tend not to fare well. In a recent case, The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune lost a libel suit brought by Marco Pierre White, a celebrity chef in London, who said that a generally favorable Times article from 1998, reprinted in The Tribune, libeled him when it said he had had a ''well-publicized bout with drugs and alcohol.''</p>
        <p>The Times drew this inference from Mr. White's autobiography, in which he referred to having embarked on a ''big bender,'' only reforming his ''decadent'' ways because ''eventually I couldn't stand watching another person getting drunk or someone else injecting smack into his veins.'' Had the case been heard in America, The Times would have argued that its characterization was an honest interpretation of what Mr. White himself had said and did not show a reckless disregard for the truth. But in England, the jury took a dim view of the American free-speech tradition. It found for Mr. White and ordered the papers to pay him some $125,000 in damages, as well as his legal costs, which are likely to be several hundred thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>By the same token, when American courts have occasion to consider England's libel laws, they are hard-pressed to contain their dislike for a system so antithetical to their own. This was made abundantly clear in 1996, when -- asked to enforce an English libel judgment because the defendant had moved to Maryland -- the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, refused. ''The signing of the Declaration of Independence, the adoption of state constitutions and the later ratification of the First Amendment signaled a major departure from English law and policy concerning free speech and freedom of the press,'' the court said.</p>
        <p>The concern for American newspapers and magazines, lawyers say, is that the recent Berezovsky ruling, as well as the growing availability of American publications on the Internet, will make them increasingly vulnerable to plaintiffs seeking to take their grievances to English courts. ''In the Internet age,'' said Patrick J. Carome, a specialist in defamation law in Washington, ''there is a worry that we're going to see more and more situations where foreign defendants are being hauled into court in countries like England.''</p>
        <p>Why does England persist in holding on to its libel laws?</p>
        <p>They certainly have few champions among newspapers in Britain. But because of the news media's almost universal unpopularity among lawmakers (who know only too well what it feels like to be on the wrong side of a tabloid article), Parliamentary efforts to amend the system have generally failed.</p>
        <p>There are some good aspects to the laws, argues David Price, a defamation lawyer in England: ''I would defend them on the basis that whether something is true or false is a useful piece of information. A trial on whether a public figure has or has not been guilty of wrongdoing is a much more useful exercise than one on whether a newspaper believed he was guilty of wrongdoing.''</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Lipstadt believes that fighting Mr. Irving in court, as unpleasant as it was, had an unforseen benefit: ''In the U.S., this would have been thrown out of court, but if it had been thrown out, Irving would have been able to say that he never got his day in court. I thought, 'This British law is making me jump through hoops.' But he was the one who was stripped naked.''</p>
