        <p>A model effort to create an equitable, multi-ethnic society in the South Pacific island nation of Fiji has been derailed by the forced removal of the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister. The United States and other democratic nations should press Fiji's new leaders to honor its Constitution, which in 1997 awarded ethnic Indian citizens the right to hold high office.</p>
        <p>The recent upheaval was largely the work of George Speight, a part-Fijian businessman who stormed the Parliament in May with a group of armed followers and held three dozen people hostage, including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, until last week. He accused Mr. Chaudhry of promoting pro-Indian policies. Mr. Speight says that Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of 812,000, have too much economic and political clout. The siege ended when military leaders bowed to Mr. Speight's demands for a new government.</p>

        <p>A model effort to create an equitable, multi-ethnic society in the South Pacific island nation of Fiji has been derailed by the forced removal of the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister. The United States and other democratic nations should press Fiji's new leaders to honor its Constitution, which in 1997 awarded ethnic Indian citizens the right to hold high office.</p>
        <p>The recent upheaval was largely the work of George Speight, a part-Fijian businessman who stormed the Parliament in May with a group of armed followers and held three dozen people hostage, including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, until last week. He accused Mr. Chaudhry of promoting pro-Indian policies. Mr. Speight says that Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of 812,000, have too much economic and political clout. The siege ended when military leaders bowed to Mr. Speight's demands for a new government.</p>
        <p>Fiji's new president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and its new prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, attempted to challenge Mr. Speight by not appointing rebel supporters to key cabinet positions. Mr. Speight responded by forcing Mr. Iloilo, who is elderly and ill, to make room in the administration for rebels and possibly for himself as well.</p>
        <p>The international community should help Mr. Chaudhry's People's Coalition regain power. Britain, Australia and New Zealand have recalled their ambassadors because of the unrest, which has included looting and arson against Indian-owned stores, and are pushing Fiji to adopt constitutional rule again. Yesterday Britain went further, canceling assistance programs and military visits.</p>
        <p>Fiji's military and new government seem intimidated by Mr. Speight and his small band of rebels. Mr. Speight is a demagogue who does not speak for the majority of indigenous Fijians. His racist, anti-democratic ideas will prevail unless Fiji's democrats and army commanders work together peacefully to renew constitutional rule.</p>
