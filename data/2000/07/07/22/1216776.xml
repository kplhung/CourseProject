        <p>The new umpires' union has given the old union until Aug. 1 to accept a tentative deal with Major League Baseball that would restore the jobs of 10 of the 22 umpires who lost their positions last year.</p>
        <p>Before the plan can be implemented, the old union has to agree to it and withdraw its grievance against baseball, and the new union has to complete a labor agreement with baseball. However, a person close to the ousted union said it is not interested in the plan.</p>
        <p>Calling the deal a framework for settlement, John Hirschbeck, president of the new union, said yesterday that it was the best the union could do for the nonworking umpires. Under the plan, six umpires who are 55 or older would receive retirement packages and the remaining six would receive cash settlements.</p>
        <p>The Major League Umpires Association is in the midst of a hearing before an arbitrator to decide the future of the 22 umpires, whose resignations were accepted last summer. It would have to abandon the grievance, which it does not plan to do.</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck said in a statement that his union, the World Umpires Association, has to move forward soon to conclude its negotiations with Major League Baseball. If the former union has not accepted the plan or negotiated an alternative by Aug. 1, Hirschbeck said, the new union will proceed to complete its negotiations with Major League Baseball, without making arrangements for the 22 out-of-work umpires.</p>
