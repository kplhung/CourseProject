        <p>One year after his biggest nightmare, Jean Van de Velde is dreaming again about winning the British Open.</p>
        <p>He had one of the worst collapses in golf history last year, making a triple-bogey on the 72nd hole at the British Open, squandering a three-stroke lead and eventually losing to Paul Lawrie in a three-way playoff with Justin Leonard. But with a four-under-par 68 today, coupled with his opening-round 71, Van de Velde was in contention again at five under par, six strokes behind Tiger Woods, the leader. After making a bogey on the No. 17 Road Hole, Van de Velde ended with momentum, making a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 18.</p>

        <p>One year after his biggest nightmare, Jean Van de Velde is dreaming again about winning the British Open.</p>
        <p>He had one of the worst collapses in golf history last year, making a triple-bogey on the 72nd hole at the British Open, squandering a three-stroke lead and eventually losing to Paul Lawrie in a three-way playoff with Justin Leonard. But with a four-under-par 68 today, coupled with his opening-round 71, Van de Velde was in contention again at five under par, six strokes behind Tiger Woods, the leader. After making a bogey on the No. 17 Road Hole, Van de Velde ended with momentum, making a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 18.</p>
        <p>''My problem over the next 24 hours will be relaxing,'' said Van de Velde, who led by one stroke through 36 holes last year and by five strokes after 54 holes.</p>
        <p>Many people wondered how Van de Velde would handle such a devastating loss, but he has handled it with honesty and humor, becoming one of the sport's most popular players.</p>
        <p>Van de Velde could not resist when someone asked what he thought about his chances. ''Anything can happen with 36 to go,'' he said. ''Even with one hole to go.''</p>
        <p>Playing primarily on the PGA Tour this year, Van de Velde, a Frenchman, is 86th on the money list, and he tied for second at the Tucson Open. He will be a sentimental favorite this weekend, and he hoped the support would spur him on.</p>
        <p>''The last three or four weeks I was very tired, but here I seem to have more energy somehow,'' Van de Velde said. ''My reception has been fantastic. But it has been like that everywhere I go.''</p>
        <p>Different Story for Lawrie</p>
        <p>Paul Lawrie, the defending champion, did not come close to making the cut at even par, finishing at nine over. A native of Scotland, Lawrie said he would probably not watch the weekend action on television.</p>
        <p>''Maybe a little on Sunday, but I don't watch much golf,'' he said. ''I'm going to take a few weeks. My year has been very frustrating.''</p>
        <p>Toms Shows He Belongs</p>
        <p>David Toms, at eight under par, has made a strong showing in his first British Open. He will play in Saturday's final group with Tiger Woods.</p>
        <p>''I've played well in the States all year, but I didn't really know what to expect from the course,'' Toms, a native of Louisiana, said. ''My first goal was to play on the weekend. I've played solid.''</p>
        <p>Toms played well enough to earn an exemption from qualifying for this year's tournament. In past years, he decided against trying to earn his way in through a qualifying tournament.</p>
        <p>''Looking at the whole experience, I guess I was a little cheap over the years,'' he said. ''I did not want to come over here and spend the money to qualify. Looking back, I wish I would have.''</p>
        <p>Duval's Back Is Aching</p>
        <p>David Duval (70-70, four under par) has played the entire British Open with a sore back, which flared up Tuesday. He has been moving gingerly on the course, particularly when he reaches into the cup to pick up his ball.</p>
        <p>''If it was any other event, I would probably not be playing,'' he said. ''I really don't know what is wrong with it, and I'm trying not to focus on it. I wish it was a different circumstance, but it's what I've been dealt this week. It has been bothering me quite a bit. I guess I simply strained my back. It's just like a sprained ankle.''</p>
