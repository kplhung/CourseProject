        <p>Robert Whitehead, a hulking, silver-haired financier, knows good arias from bad. As a bountiful contributor to the Metropolitan Opera, he wore black tie at patron dinners and mingled with famous singers.</p>
        <p>The investor, who is also well versed in global financial fraud, has also made some appearances in prisons here and abroad,  Manhattan prosecutors said. Yesterday, they announced a 16-count indictment against him on charges of grand larceny and securities fraud.</p>
        <p>To the unsuspecting, like his 13 most recent victims, prosecutors say, Mr. Whitehead, 57, was a cultured investor who was trading in Brazilian treasury bonds. He dressed impeccably, spoke fluent French and a smattering of Italian and was educated at Le Rosey, the Swiss boarding school,  and Yale University. Or so he said; Yale has no record of his attendance there.</p>
        <p>He operated his business, the Currency Group Inc., in Branford, Conn., and lived there with his wife in a gated community. His clients included a computer programmer from New Jersey, a Brazilian charity and other people from Canada to Thailand, said Andrew Hruska, an assistant district attorney.</p>
        <p>The indictment contends that Mr. Whitehead lured investors with promises of sky-high returns on the trading of Brazilian bonds, stole more than $10 million from them and instead of investing it, spent it on the opera, elegant restaurants, lavish gifts and custom-made suits.</p>
        <p>The scheme unraveled when he approached a money manager in New York last year about setting up an account, prosecutors said. The manager's diligence revealed that Mr. Whitehead was a felon who had been convicted of wire fraud and brokering phony loans, and also faced parole hearings on charges that he falsely represented himself as an exporter of frozen poultry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitehead, in a grubby polo shirt, tan slacks and scuffed loafers, was arraigned yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and charged with a scheme to defraud investors of more than $10 million.</p>
        <p>He denies all the charges.</p>
        <p>Only last year, Mr. Whitehead spent $40,000 on hand-tailored suits, prosecutors said. But yesterday the once-elegant man -- who stands 6-foot-1 and weighs some 300 pounds -- looked rumpled. His hair, once dyed black, had grown silver at the roots. Maintaining appearances cannot have been easy, for Mr. Whitehead has spent the last three months at the Rikers Island Detention Complex on a parole violation, and was arrested there Thursday on the latest charges.</p>
        <p>As he sat in the courtroom reading a copy of the indictment, wrists handcuffed, five of his lawyers hovered about him awaiting his not guilty plea. His lawyers say that he is a changed man, who this time worked honestly for the benefit of his international clientele.</p>
        <p>While it was not an unfamiliar moment for him, it was certainly a come-down, and even his lawyers looked concerned. ''He's not guilty,'' said one of his lawyers, Edward R. Hammock, adding that Mr. Whitehead had made every effort to return money to unhappy investors. Mr. Hammock also accused the Manhattan district attorney of unfairness, saying, ''It looks like Robert Whitehead's history is his downfall.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitehead, who was born in California and is now an Irish citizen, has traveled broadly. In 1987, he fled the United States while awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to brokering phony loans. Prosecutors tracked his credit-card receipts as he roamed from Canada to Hong Kong and Greece.</p>
        <p>He was finally caught in Italy and jailed in Rome for 18 months, where he developed a working knowledge of Italian. He was finally extradited and served time in an upstate jail until his release in 1994.</p>
        <p>By all appearances, Mr. Whitehead rebuilt his life with remarkable ease. He had a staff of 10 in his office and frequented Manhattan's finest restaurants, prosecutors said. He also gave $50,000 to the Metropolitan Opera last year, and is listed as a member of the Golden Horseshoe program, along with such investors as Sid R. Bass and Henry R. Kravis.</p>
        <p>But the arias ended with his most recent parole violation, in April, after which he was sent to Rikers Island. Prosecutors say that Mr. Whitehead falsely told his parole officer that he had only $20,000 in savings, when he had more than  $200,000, and 50 to 60 bank accounts across the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hammock, the lawyer, said that prosecutors exploited the mechanism of parole to lock up Mr. Whitehead and make it impossible for him to organize his affairs.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Metropolitan Opera said they did not know what they would do about Mr. Whitehead's Golden Horseshoe membership, which could turn out to have been bought with money stolen from Mr. Whitehead's clients. When asked whether they would return his donations, Sharon E. Grubin, the Met's general counsel, said: ''I don't know that the Met has ever faced this before. Without knowing more of the facts, I don't know what we'll do.''</p>
