        <p>Stephen Gendin, an activist and writer who founded a nationally known mail-order prescription service for people infected with H.I.V., died Wednesday in New York. He was 34.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gendin died of cardiac arrest while undergoing chemotherapy for AIDS-related lymphoma, said Sean Strubb, founder of Poz, a national magazine about life with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gendin spent the last 15 years working to help people who had AIDS or who were infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes it. He was a founder and the chief executive of the Community Prescription Service, a mail-order pharmacy service that also distributes information to people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gendin also became known  through a regular column he wrote for Poz. In the column, he discussed in graphic detail the toll AIDS took on his body, his fantasies of political assassination and, in an article that incited outrage among many gay men, the guilt and the pleasure he felt from having unprotected sex.</p>
        <p>As a freshman at Brown University, Mr. Gendin learned he was infected with H.I.V. He founded the Rhode Island Chapter of Act Up, the AIDS protest group, and was active in fund-raising for the organization's New York chapter. He regularly took part in protests, rallies and mass acts of civil disobedience, for which he had a long arrest record. He was a director of AID for AIDS, which distributes medications to patients in Latin America. He was also a founder of Sex Panic, a group that contends it is preserving New York's untrammeled ''sexual culture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gendin is survived by his partner, Kyle MacDowell; his father, Sidney Gendin of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and his sister, Margo Hart of Ionia, Mich.</p>
