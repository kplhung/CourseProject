        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about unread best sellers (Arts &amp; Ideas pages, July 15) immediately brought to mind the time when I was chairman of a search committee for a new academic department head.</p>
        <p>At one of our evaluation committee meetings everyone expressed how greatly they were impressed by the publication record of one of the applicants. When I asked what I thought was an innocent question, ''Which of his papers did you find most interesting and impressive?'', I was met with stony silence. Not one member of the committee had read even one of the papers.</p>

        <p>I now realize that like unread best sellers, most academic publications are valued only for filling resumes and curriculums vitae and for bragging about, not actually being read.</p>
