        <p>Stacy Dragila is the world record-holder in the women's pole vault with a clearance of 15 feet 1 3/4 inches. Her event will be included in the Olympics for the first time at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. First, however, she must make the American team. The thought of failing to clear any height in today's qualifying round at the Olympic trials had left her so nervous and irritated in recent weeks that it had begun to affect her jumping.</p>
        <p>No-heighting, as it is called, is a pole-vaulter's biggest fear. Futility seems to spread sometimes like a computer virus among the world's best jumpers, male and female. At the 1992 Olympic trials in New Orleans, Dan O'Brien infamously failed to clear even any height in the decathlon pole vault. Later, at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, the men's world record-holder, Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, also suffered three misses at his opening height.</p>
        <p>Just last Friday, the men's American record-holder, Jeff Hartwig, had trouble with his contact lenses and lost his depth perception, bailing out on all three attempts in the qualifying round of the Olympic trials. The height was 18-2, a full 19 1/2 inches below his personal best. Sprinters and distance runners can sometimes cruise through the early rounds at important meets, conserving energy for the final. But in the pole vault, Hartwig said: ''Every time you step on the runway you have to give 100 percent. You have to go full out, and once in a while things go wrong.''</p>
        <p>Today, 20 of the 36 competitors in the women's pole vault failed to clear the opening height of 13 feet 2 1/4 inches. Dragila, 29, did not suffer the same wrenching disappointment, clearing the bar easily on her first attempt to advance to Sunday's final. All she has to do is finish among the top three and she will be on her way to Sydney to challenge for a gold medal. But before she arrived here for the trials, she had begun to think the unthinkable: suppose she did not clear a height? In such a technical event, so many things can go wrong for her: the run-up of 106 feet, the planting of a 14-foot fiberglass pole and the gymnastic ability to invert her body in midair.</p>
        <p>Last week, while training in Pocatello, Idaho, she finally approached one of her coaches, Brian Jansen, who is familiar with various techniques of sports psychology. ''I'm a nervous wreck,'' Dragila, recalled telling Jansen. ''The last few meets I've been going to, I've been getting really, really upset. I don't know what is going on.''</p>
        <p>At her recent meets, she needed two and three attempts to clear even lower heights, which only increased her tension and uncertainty.</p>
        <p>''Tell me your fears,'' Jansen said to Dragila.</p>
        <p>''I fear I will no-height,'' she replied. ''I fear I'm not going to make the team. How do I work through this?''</p>
        <p>Jansen suggested some common techniques of relaxation and visualization. Dragila lay on the floor in a dark room and imagined herself making the perfect jump, clearing 16 feet, ignoring all distractions, standing on top of the medal podium at the Olympic trials and the Olympic Games with a gold medal replacing the albatross around her neck.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to recognize your fears,'' Dragila said. ''If you don't, you can go out there and really mess things up. I had to try to recognize my fears and try to stomp them and throw them away.''</p>
        <p>She completed three visualization sessions last week and arrived at today's qualifying event calm and assured on a baking, azure afternoon.</p>
        <p>She was prepared to jump beyond 13-2 1/4, but officials were concerned that if the 16 qualifiers  attempted to go any higher, perhaps half the field would have been eliminated before Sunday's final. A withered field would not look good for this incipient Olympic event -- it could have harmed its credibility and longevity -- so qualifying was halted at the opening height.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to stop anyone from having an opportunity to compete in the finals,'' said Dave Nielsen, who is Dragila's coach. ''At the same time, you'd like to see the field a little tighter.''</p>
        <p>The 5-7 Dragila, who is from nearby Auburn, Calif., where she competed in rodeo in high school, jumped 15-5 earlier this season in a beach competition, but the height was not ratified as a world record because the runway did not meet international specifications. She believes she could jump 16 feet on Sunday if the wind and her nerves are not swirling.</p>
        <p>''If she gets her run down, I think she can,'' Nielsen said. ''Why not? She doesn't have anything else to do. She's here to jump.''</p>
        <p>How high can she jump eventually? Given that women lack the speed and upper-body strength of men, she said she would consider 17 feet the ultimate jump for a woman.</p>
        <p>''A 17-foot jump for women would be the same as a 20-foot jump for men,'' Dragila said.</p>
        <p>Finally, she can think about jumping high, having lost her fear of failing when the bar is low.</p>
        <p>Adkins Fails to Advance</p>
        <p>Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic champion who has battled clinical depression the past four years, failed to qualify for the 400-meter hurdles final, finishing sixth in his semifinal heat in 50.22 seconds.</p>
