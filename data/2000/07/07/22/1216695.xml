        <p>The United States Olympic Committee admitted to flaws in its drug-testing procedures yesterday, but denied that it either encouraged athletes to take prohibited substances or that large numbers of positive drug tests had gone unpunished.</p>
        <p>The committee's assertions came four days after Dr. Wade Exum, the U.S.O.C.'s former drug-testing chief, charged in a lawsuit against the committee that half the American athletes who tested positive in recent years were not barred from competition.</p>
        <p>Exum leveled new charges yesterday, saying he had once been asked to participate in a project to inject American athletes with ATP synthase, a naturally occurring protein enzyme that fuels muscle cell operation. He also said that unauthorized people were dispensing drugs at U.S.O.C. headquarters in Colorado Springs. The U.S.O.C. denied both allegations.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. has sought to portray Exum, who was one of the few black executives in the organization until he resigned last month, as a disgruntled employee whose job was threatened by a reorganization of testing procedures. Exum also claimed racial discrimination in his lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Rich Young, a Colorado Springs lawyer who was hired by the U.S.O.C. to investigate the claims that Exum originally made last year, said that he found that some positive drug tests had gone unpunished, but that the majority involved the stimulant ephedrine, which is contained in common cold medications.</p>
        <p>Like Exum, Young would not provide any specific numbers of positive tests found unpunished or name all the drugs involved. Asked if he found any attempts to hide positive drug tests, Young said the national governing bodies of some sports did not provide the paperwork on every positive test, but he added, ''I didn't find any coverups and I didn't find any improprieties.''</p>
        <p>Scott Blackmun, a senior sports administrator for the U.S.O.C., sought to distance the U.S.O.C. from potential coverups, saying the role of meting out punishments belonged to the national governing bodies of various sports, not the U.S.O.C. Privately, U.S.O.C. officials have conceded that the governing bodies, run by volunteers and fearful of lawsuits, have not always vigorously prosecuted positive tests.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Joyner, vice chairman of the U.S.O.C.'s antidoping committee, said he had never heard Exum raise vehement complaints about the committee's drug-testing procedures until he resigned.</p>
        <p>Sensitive to charges that it is the ''fox guarding the henhouse,'' the U.S.O.C. will now use an independent agency to conduct the testing of American athletes.</p>
