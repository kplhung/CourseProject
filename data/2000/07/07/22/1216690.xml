        <p>Successive House and Senate votes on Thursday night to ease restrictions on American travel and certain sales to Cuba are the latest evidence of a gradual but seismic shift toward normalizing ties with the Marxist-run island, according to lawmakers and experts on Cuba.</p>
        <p>Republicans defected by the score from their party's traditional pro-embargo stance and this week handed a dual victory to the coalition of farming interests, business groups and Democrats trying to lift American sanctions.</p>
        <p>Both chambers of Congress approved the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. And the House went one step further, seeking to allow American tourism to the island by barring money to the federal agencies that enforce against it.</p>
        <p>None of the provisions are expected to win final approval before September, if ever. But they signal an important change in how American decision-makers view Cuba, possibly the most momentous shift since 1994, when the Clinton administration first decided to intercept Cuban refugees at sea and send them home.</p>
        <p>And, the experts and lawmakers say, the change raises the likelihood that the next president and Congress will feel freer to remove the remaining restrictions on ties with Havana.</p>
        <p>''Clearly the barriers are coming down,'' said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a hemispheric forum in Washington. ''The people who want to hold onto the structure of the embargo are slowly losing the game.''</p>
        <p>An administration official predicted the trade ban would likely be eliminated after the November elections, no matter who controlled Congress or the White House.</p>
        <p>The embargo-easing amendments in the House on Thursday night, sponsored by Representatives Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas, both conservative Republicans, passed with votes of 232 to 186 in favor of the travel provision and 301 to 116 supporting food and medical sales. Within an hour, the Senate overwhelmingly approved -- 79 to 13 -- an agriculture bill that also approved food and medicine sales but barred American credits to facilitate the trade.</p>
        <p>The votes are likely to strengthen the prospects for a separate measure by Representative George Nethercutt, Republican of Washington, to allow food and medical sales, which moves into a conference committee in September.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders and Cuban-American lawmakers who have sought to stymie the Nethercutt proposal will have to rethink their stance, said John S. Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a clearinghouse for American businesses interested in trade with Cuba.</p>
        <p>''It used to be Democrats fighting Republicans on wanting to expand the relationship with Cuba,'' Mr. Kavulich said. ''Now, it's Republicans fighting Republicans, with the Democrats standing to the side waiting to see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Cuba watchers say several factors have changed the perception of Cuba and the United States policy of diplomatic isolation and economic boycott.</p>
        <p>The bruising battles over trade with China and the Clinton administration's rationale that engaging Beijing is in America's strategic interest have invited charges of hypocrisy over Cuba.</p>
        <p>In advocating greater contact with Cubans, Mr. Sanford invoked a conservative icon, former President Ronald Reagan, saying his decision to let American students travel to Eastern Europe helped bring down the Berlin Wall.</p>
        <p>''The rhetoric behind this was that you change societies by contact, and that Americans can make a difference by being there,'' said Pamela Falk, a Cuba expert at the City University of New York's law school.</p>
        <p>But some supporters of sanctions say Fidel Castro has shown himself much more impervious to liberalizing reforms than China's leaders.</p>
        <p>''The American public believes Cuba has changed because the world has changed,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey. ''It's an assumption that unfortunately is contradicted by reality.''</p>
        <p>Another significant factor influencing Americans' shifting perceptions of Cuba came in the Elian Gonzalez case. From the morning news through the nightly talk shows, Americans were forced to think about Cuba -- and Cuban-Americans -- for months.</p>
        <p>The administration's decision to return Elian to Cuba over what many saw as the strident objections of the 6-year-old's Miami relatives undercut the image of the well-financed Cuban-American lobby as invulnerable and not to be challenged.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Joe Garcia, the newly appointed executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation, a lobby that long exerted virtual veto power over United States policy, acknowledged losing critical ground.</p>
        <p>''Probably the most important thing we realized was we have to depend on ourselves in this struggle to educate the American people,'' Mr. Garcia said.</p>
