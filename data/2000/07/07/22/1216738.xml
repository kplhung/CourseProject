        <p>THIS should have happened a few months ago. The Braves and the Mets should have been getting it on in April or May, reviving their rivalry early and often.</p>
        <p>Instead, baseball has been operating with a mentality of painting itself into isolated corners, like Dagwood Bumstead in the Sunday comics.</p>
        <p>Last night the Mets were visiting the Braves for the first time this season, with the same dismal result, a 6-3 loss. They have won only 12 of 41 regular-season games in Atlanta since 1992 and were 0-3 in last year's playoffs, which constitutes a weird kind of rivalry, doesn't it?</p>
        <p>The Mets had not been here since Kenny Rogers, with a tepid air of inevitability, walked home the winning run in the 11th inning of the sixth game of the National League Championship Series late on the night of Oct. 19.</p>
        <p>Through the marvel of Major League Baseball planning, the two teams did not meet again until June 29, the night 600 New York City police officers were needed to usher John Rocker into Shea Stadium. Now that Rocker has settled into being just another knucklehead, the teams can go about their business of competing for the division title.</p>
        <p>''I think it is awfully late to be here for the first time,'' Bobby Valentine said last night.</p>
        <p>This gaping void between engagements allowed Braves fans to smirk that the Braves have dominated the Mets for the past decade. Mets fans could reply with some veracity that they would have stood up to the Yankees better than the weary Braves did in the World Series.</p>
        <p>Who knows what miracles Melvin Mora might have wrought? Now the Mets are trying to get Barry Larkin to supplant Mora as shortstop pro tem; things happen fast.</p>
        <p>There is a history to these two teams, but baseball has done its best to suppress rivalries in recent years, playing a so-called balanced schedule with a gooey dollop of empty-calorie interleague games. Through this gimmick, the Mets have been playing before empty club boxes in Toronto while the Braves have been trying to bring major league baseball to the grim dome in Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>The people who run baseball are nothing if not astute. Just the other day they announced plans for an unbalanced schedule in 2001, meaning teams will play up to 19 games against division rivals.</p>
        <p>There is some fear that baseball will realign what is left of the two-league rivalry in the near future, perhaps separating the Mets and Braves. ''I don't want 'em to go away; I want to beat 'em,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Next year, at least, there will probably be three trips by the Mets to Atlanta and three by the Braves to New York. This means teams can take more responsibility for their own fate, can give themselves a boost in the damp of springtime, turn on the burners in the heat of summer and protect their turf in the chill of autumn.</p>
        <p>There is nothing like two teams starting to develop warm and fuzzy feelings toward each other: Those lucky dogs! Those impudent pretenders! Those cowardly weasels!</p>
        <p>This is what pennant races used to be like. The classic subway rivalry between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants was exacerbated by its frequency -- 22 games a year. If Sal Maglie, the Barber, shaved the swarthy jowls of Carl Furillo, the man known as Skoonj would not have to wait interminably for his chance to bunt down the first-base line and see if he could leave cleat marks up and down Maglie's flannels.</p>
        <p>Of course, there was no designated-hitter rule to encourage a Roger Clemens to become the classic American League bully, throwing inside against great hitters like Mike Piazza, knowing he would never have to stand in the general vicinity of home plate.</p>
        <p>The Mets now have a healthy little rivalry against Clemens, but they will have to wait a very long time to see him again. Late October would work.</p>
        <p>Baseball needs its rivalries, but interleague schedules and expansion have diluted the product, creating a schedule of one-night stands and creating makeshift return excursions to make up inconvenient rainouts.</p>
        <p>At least the Mets and Braves play home-and-home series in September, when division rivals should meet. ''If you play enough games, they usually even out,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>They haven't evened out for the Mets here, but they keep hustling. Last night, with Larkin rumors infiltrating the dugout at game time, the Mets fell behind by 2-0, ''but I didn't see us give up,'' Valentine said, hopefully. The team's collective memories of Atlanta are not good, but at least they are memories, and baseball should do more to stimulate them.</p>
