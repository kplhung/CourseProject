        <p>Coach Al Groh all but squashed speculation today that the Jets might pursue the free-agent wide receiver Carl Pickens, and said that he wanted to give the group of young Jets receivers an opportunity to prove themselves in preseason games.</p>
        <p>Groh said money was one of the primary reasons the Jets, who would have had to cut a veteran to make room for Pickens, would most likely pass on him.</p>
        <p>''Would we like to have Jerry Rice play for us? Sure,'' Groh said. ''It's what you can afford relative to the other needs of our football team.</p>
        <p>''I'm not about to say it would never happen, and in two days you say, 'You said it would never happen,' '' Groh continued, speaking of Pickens, who was released by the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Pickens's agent, Hadley Engelhard, spoke to the Jets today, but it appears the Tennessee Titans are the most likely suitor to sign Pickens. The Titans need a big target for quarterback Steve McNair and they have about $2 million in salary-cap room. Meanwhile, the Jets' receivers were encouraged by Groh's faith in them.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy the coaches have confidence we can get it done,'' said Fred Coleman, listed with the third team and a long shot to make the team. ''That makes us try harder. It's hard to play good when you know they're about to bring a guy in to put in front of you automatically.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Jets' receiving situation remains muddled. Other than Wayne Chrebet on one side, there is no sure bet among the group to fill the spot vacated when Keyshawn Johnson was traded.</p>
        <p>The first week of practice has largely been devoid of eye-popping plays, although Dedric Ward, who beat Aaron Glenn for a 30-yard touchdown reception over the middle on Thursday, has the inside track among a group that includes Laveranues Coles, Windrell Hayes, the free-agent signee Yatil Green and Coleman. Today Groh offered his first assessments.</p>
        <p>Hayes, who ''catches anything within a 20-mile radius,'' according to Coleman, missed two days while visiting his sick mother. Groh said that meant Hayes was a little behind on what was installed in the offense this week. Coles, whose speed is his selling point, earned praise for the big load of special teams and receiving assignments he has handled. Although Coles has not broken away for a big gain yet, he has made several receptions.</p>
        <p>Groh seemed disappointed in the performance of Green, who joined the team July 11 as the Jets' hope for a big receiver to replace Johnson. Green, 26, who has had 10 knee surgeries and whose first two professional seasons were obliterated by knee injuries, still seems hampered -- mentally and physically -- by his painful history. Green has made little impression in the first week of practice, with few balls going his way, and his cuts have not looked sharp.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes guys have got to get open to make some noise,'' Groh said. ''His experience in the league is more like a rookie.''</p>
        <p>Green spoke today of how the constant swelling in his knees robs him of at least one or two steps, and how he spends five minutes each morning  wiggling and stretching his legs to get the blood circulating before he even tries to get out of bed and walk.</p>
        <p>Green puts his legs in buckets of ice for 15 minutes after each practice to try to bring back the spring in them. But it is unfamiliarity with the system, more than his health, that Green blames for his slow start.</p>
        <p>''When you're comfortable, you make plays,'' he said. ''It's taken a little longer than I anticipated. Once I make it through two-a-days, my knees will feel a lot better. I'm trying to put it behind me, but people sometimes don't understand how I feel. I'm committed to being a football player. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get on the field.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets will have their first scrimmage Saturday at Hofstra University, starting at 10:30 a.m. It will be open to the public, unless rain forces the Jets inside. . . . JASON WILTZ, a defensive tackle, left the second practice with what appeared to be an injury to his right elbow or upper arm.</p>
