        <p>IT isn't every day that you get to talk about legal negotiations in which the silent partner is the angel of death. That may seem like a melodramatic way to begin, but the description is accurate all the same.</p>
        <p>Officially, the ones at the table are lawyers, representing Swiss commercial banks and Holocaust victims. Their task is to get all the jots and tittles straight on a 1998 agreement by the banks to pay $1.25 billion in restitution for their -- how to put it politely? -- dubious behavior during and after World War II.</p>
        <p>The reason this becomes a New York story is that the agreement needs the blessing of the courts, and that assignment happens to fall to a federal judge in Brooklyn, Edward R. Korman. It is up to Judge Kor man not only to say that the 1998 deal is fair but also to approve a plan for distributing the money to many tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors with claims against the Swiss.</p>
        <p>Expectations early on were that the cash would have been flowing by now. But it isn't, and it may not until the end of the year, at the earliest. The judge has been unable to get the ball rolling because the lawyers have yet to settle all the details.</p>
        <p>Leaving aside for a moment the question of who's to blame, the delay means a good deal more than losing a few months. This is where the hovering presence of the angel of death is felt.</p>
        <p>With every month that is frittered away, hundreds of people who are supposed to benefit from the agreement die, maybe even a couple of thousand. The World Jewish Congress puts the number of survivors at roughly 500,000 worldwide, including 40,000 in the New York region. The congress also estimates that 10 percent of them are now dying every year. You do the grim math.</p>
        <p>The high cost of delay is evident at Self help Community Services, a New York agency that assists people who were persecuted by the Nazis in the 1930's and 40's. Selfhelp says that 58 percent of those knocking on its doors are 80 or older, women and men painfully aware that the clock is running.</p>
        <p>Y OU'RE faced with this horrible dilemma, which says that if we don't do it quickly, what's the point?'' said Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Claims Conference, which represents Jewish Holocaust survivors in seeking restitution not only from the Swiss but also from Germany and Austria.</p>
        <p>Mind you, Jews were not the Nazis' only victims. Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and people with physical or mental disabilities were among those who suffered. They, too, are covered by the Swiss deal.</p>
        <p>The claims against the banks are based on powerful evidence that they behaved dishonorably, despite Switzerland's professed neutrality during the war. Money and valuables deposited with them for safekeeping against the marauding Nazis disappeared into the maw of the Swiss system, with bankers saying later that they didn't know a thing.</p>
        <p>When the restitution issue built up steam a few years ago, the Swiss Bankers' Association said it could find fewer than 800 accounts belonging to Jews and others who were persecuted. The batteries on their calculators must have been low. Last December, a commission led by Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, uncovered 54,000 accounts linked to victims of the Nazis. That figure was later revised to 46,000.</p>
        <p>Since December, there have been tough negotiations over whether the banks would also allow access to even more information, through databases on several million accounts from the Nazi era. Disagreements arose as well on issues affecting others entitled to compensation -- refugees who were turned away at the Swiss border, for example, and slave laborers for companies that may have banked in Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Each step of the way has been tortured, and lawyers for survivors put full blame on the Swiss. ''It's been immensely frustrating negotiating with them,'' said Burt Neu borne, the survivors' lead lawyer. ''It was like plunging your fist into a bowl of Jell-O. You punch it and make a hole, but as soon as you withdraw your fist the hole fills up again.''</p>
        <p>Roger M. Witten, a Washington-based lawyer for the banks, denies trying to keep the pace slow. ''Everybody is really trying to get this right so that it's not challenged later,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Judge Korman is understood to be greatly frustrated, too. But it now seems that the negotiations are far enough along that his approval of the agreement could come in a few days. It would be none too soon. The angel of death is not known for patience.</p>
