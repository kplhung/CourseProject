        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating why its officials ignored evidence for 18 years that W. R. Grace and Company was using ore laden with asbestos in an array of building products.</p>
        <p>An agency study in 1982 found alarming levels of asbestos in ore that Grace had said included harmless amounts of the material, which can cause cancer.</p>
        <p>But the agency shelved the report, scuttled follow-up studies and continued to accept the company's lower figures, E.P.A. officials said this week.</p>
        <p>That allowed Grace, a maker of specialty chemicals and building materials, to largely avoid government scrutiny and use the ore in products, like fireproofing, that the company promoted as asbestos-free.</p>
        <p>The widely used fireproofing materials, as well as attic insulation and other products, largely remain in  thousands of homes and offices.</p>
        <p>But the health risks are unclear, because it is not known how much asbestos may be present in the products. Grace said it had tried to remove as much asbestos as possible during processing, and contended that the products contained only trace amounts. E.P.A officials are advising homeowners to call the agency for more information if they are concerned that they may have Grace's loose-fill insulation, known as Zonolite, which it sold until 1984.</p>
        <p>In acknowledging the report this week, E.P.A. officials also said that an agency official in 1983 misrepresented the report and played down its findings in responding to Congressional inquiries about the level of asbestos in the ore, known as vermiculite.</p>
        <p>The report resurfaced after the E.P.A. began an investigation in December into a health crisis in Libby, Mont., where Grace mined vermiculite until 1990. Workers and residents are dying from lung disease at rates far above the national average. Agency officials are studying thousands of documents to try to determine why the government failed to oversee the Grace operation properly and why officials did not follow up on the report.</p>
        <p>The report, letters and other records have been sent to the E.P.A. inspector general, who plans to begin an inquiry on Monday, officials said.</p>
        <p>''We don't ask our inspector general to do an investigation lightly,'' said Steve Johnson, deputy assistant administrator of the office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. ''We want to know precisely what did happen.''</p>
        <p>E.P.A. officials said this week that they have uncovered Grace documents that show high levels of asbestos in the ore. Paul Peronard, head of an E.P.A. team trying to clean up the Montana mine site, said, ''It doesn't appear to me that the data contained in the documents were shared with anybody else.''</p>
        <p>Grace officials yesterday did not dispute the 1982 E.P.A. report, but said their own studies have consistently shown much smaller amounts of asbestos.</p>
        <p>''Our results from measuring the ore do not find the same thing that E.P.A.'s results do,'' said William Corcoran, vice president for public and regulatory affairs of Grace, which is based in Columbia, Md.</p>
        <p>Questions about the mining operation were touched off by newspaper articles last fall on the health problems in Montana. Lawsuits that workers and residents had filed accuse Grace of covering up the hazards posed by the mining operation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corcoran said: ''We don't believe we've ever covered them up. We know people have been hurt.'' He added that the company would prefer to continue trying to settle the lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Grace began using the vermiculite  in its insulation in the early 1960's.  At issue now is how much asbestos -- in a form known as tremolite -- made its way into those products. A growing body of medical evidence has raised concern among doctors about this lesser known form of asbestos.</p>
        <p>''Tremolite is one of the most dangerous fibers,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Moline, an occupational and environmental health specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>At its processing plants, Grace had tried to remove most of the asbestos from the vermiculite in its Zonolite line of products. The insulation is believed to be in as many as one million homes. Some asbestos remained in the insulation, but Grace did not warn consumers, The Boston Globe reported earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Grace has maintained that its products contain only trace amounts of asbestos -- far below the 1 percent level at which the E.P.A. restricts its use.</p>
        <p>Consumer concern over the insulation has raised another issue that is confounding government officials: how best to measure asbestos.</p>
        <p>Homeowners who are having their insulation tested for contamination are getting widely varying results -- from ''traces'' to 2 percent asbestos, said Wayne Toland, the E.P.A. asbestos coordinator in Boston. One test turned up 5 percent. ''The results are not necessarily consistent,'' Mr. Toland said. ''The method being employed varied and so did the results.''</p>
        <p>The problem, he said, is that laboratories are unfamiliar with vermiculite and tremolite and do not know how to properly prepare the samples. He said his office has hired an asbestos expert, Eric J. Chatfield, of Chatfield Technical Consulting in Mississauga, Ontario, to develop a procedure for preparing test samples.</p>
        <p>In Denver, Mr. Peronard said he also is working to develop new methods of testing vermiculite, since the common techniques are designed to detect asbestos at quantities of 20 percent or more -- huge by today's standards, where 1 percent or less may be cause for concern.</p>
        <p>''If you look at it at the wrong angle, you won't see the fibers,'' Mr. Peronard said. ''We obviously have the fear that we're undercounting and underreporting the asbestos content of samples.''</p>
        <p>Grace has written to the agency questioning the need for new procedures.</p>
        <p>''E.P.A. does have methods for determining what is asbestos content, which have been peer reviewed and scientifically accepted for years and years,'' Mr. Corcoran said, ''so we are trying to get some understanding of why, if those methods are good enough for every other situation, why are they not good enough for this one.''</p>
        <p>Julie Yang, who worked as a scientist for Grace and designed the company's asbestos laboratory techniques, said in an interview that she had developed her own method of measuring asbestos fibers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yang said she avoided counting things that looked like fibers but were not, like the edges of platelets. As a consequence, she said she came up with results that were typically 50 percent less than those that would have been produced using methods suggested by regulatory authorities.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yang said the company tested its products only once or twice a year. The tests were expensive and the company was more concerned with identifying rich veins of vermiculate, she said.</p>
        <p>The 1982 study was triggered by an outbreak of health problems among workers at a Marysville, Ohio, plant where vermiculite from Grace's Montana mine was used in making fertilizer. A federal investigation in 1978 found that four workers suffered from bloody lungs. X-rays showed one in four workers had lung abnormalities.</p>
        <p>In late October 1980, Thomas Dixon, an E.P.A. analyst who then worked in the toxicology branch, went to Montana to gather samples of Grace's vermiculite ore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dixon said that he and the agency's consultants collected dozens of scrapings from the mine and an adjoining cleaning plant, which were then shipped to a laboratory for testing.</p>
        <p>They found 21 percent to 26 percent asbestos in the ore, and up to 7 percent in the cleaned form that was shipped to plants. The five grades of clean ore they tested ranged from 2 to 7 percent, with only one category falling below the E.P.A.'s regulatory threshold of 1 percent.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Grace has maintained that far smaller amounts of asbestos contaminated its ore. For instance, in a 1986 letter to the E.P.A. in which Grace argued for an exemption from proposed rules to label products that have asbestos, the company said its Montana ore was sullied by only 4 to 6 percent asbestos coming out of the mine, and less than 0.5 percent on average when cleaned.</p>
        <p>But the E.P.A. never carried out its plans to follow up on its mine study by examining the material at processing plants. Nor did it test the consumer products made with the ore as planned, agency officials said, saying they moved on to pressing health matters.</p>
        <p>''The priority dropped and we were off on other things, like looking at dioxin for the first time,'' said Martin Halper, a former toxicology division chief.</p>
        <p>At the time officials were considering follow-up studies, some E.P.A. staff members became concerned for their own safety.</p>
        <p>A Grace executive described in a memorandum how he received a call on May 20, 1982, from an E.P.A. employee in Denver who ''had just heard that vermiculite may be contaminated with asbestos.''</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. uses vermiculite to pack samples for shipments to laboratories for analysis,'' the Grace executive said. ''I spoke to him for a few minutes because he was so upset and I did not want to transfer him without calming him down. They dump half a bag of vermiculite into a shipping carton two or three times a day. I told him that the exposures would undoubtedly be low if good ventilation was provided and that the respirator he indicated they were using would provide additional protection.''</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. report surfaced briefly in 1983 when Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, and another member of Congress forwarded to E.P.A. a letter from a Grace competitor who asked: ''Why did E.P.A. embark on such an extensive project collecting, analyzing and characterizing vermiculite samples for asbestos contamination and then suddenly choose both to simply drop its intended second, and more critical, phase of the project.''</p>
        <p>The response came from an acting assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, who, Mr. Peronard said, wrongly cited a table of data in the study as indicating the asbestos fell below 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The official concluded: ''If we receive additional information concerning asbestos containing vermiculite, we will evaluate it and modify our priorities, if appropriate.''</p>
        <p>''He mixed it up,'' Mr. Peronard said.</p>
