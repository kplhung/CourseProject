        <p>As Senator Robert G. Torricelli prepares to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, federal prosecutors are intensifying their inquiry into the role that his office may have played in a series of illegal contributions to his 1996 Senate campaign, lawyers and others familiar with the case say.</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, Mr. Torricelli said he believed prosecutors had effectively wrapped up their investigation last month, when a Korean-American businessman who was a major donor to Mr. Torricelli and other Democrats pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations.</p>
        <p>But lawyers familiar with the federal inquiry say it has gained new momentum with the decision of the businessman, David Chang, to cooperate with the authorities in return for the promise of a lighter sentence.</p>
        <p>They say prosecutors working for the Justice Department's campaign-finance task force are focusing more closely on the possible role of Torricelli staff members in directing and accounting for the improper contributions of Mr. Chang and others.</p>
        <p>Officials would not characterize the strength of the evidence provided by Mr. Chang, whose credibility has sometimes been an issue in his business dealings as well as his legal troubles. Nor is it clear that any laws were broken by aides to Mr. Torricelli, who, as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is one of the party's most important fund-raisers.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Torricelli suggested that his staff members had not been singled out by the prosecutors and were cooperating fully, lawyers and others with knowledge of the case said one of Mr. Torricelli's longtime aides had refused to answer at least some questions, citing her constitutional right against self-incrimination. One lawyer said the aide, Roberta Stern, was involved in arranging one or more fund-raising events at the Hilton hotel in Fort Lee, N.J., that was formerly owned in part by Mr. Chang. Two lawyers said prosecutors were scrutinizing the campaign's use of the hotel and whether it was properly reported as an in-kind contribution to the candidate.</p>
        <p>People close to Mr. Torricelli said several aides, including James P. Fox, his chief of staff, and Adam C. Crain, his executive assistant, submitted to questioning by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents. ''Each cooperated fully, and provided valuable information, and each was prepared to testify on behalf of the government at the trial of David Chang,'' said Abbe D. Lowell, the lawyer who represents  Mr. Torricelli and the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowell would not say whether Ms. Stern had declined to answer the task force's questions. He said she ''would have provided valuable evidence for the government had the plea of Mr. Chang not occurred.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lowell has fought to limit the scope of the federal inquiry, lawyers said. They said he had repeatedly called senior Justice Department officials, including Eric Holder, the deputy attorney general, to complain about the actions of the prosecutors on the campaign-finance task force.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he believed the task force was focusing on his own fund-raising activities, Mr. Torricelli said, ''Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>''There's about three incidents where people unfortunately reimbursed contributors,'' he said, referring to cases in which six donors to his 1996 campaign have pleaded guilty to illegally funneling contributions through others. ''As far as I know, those three incidents have now been discovered and fully explored.''</p>
        <p>The first of those episodes came to light last year, when a former Bergen County Republican leader, Berek P. Don, and Carmine Alampi, his former law partner, pleaded guilty to illegally reimbursing employees in his office, with Mr. Chang's money, for $11,000 they gave to Mr. Torricelli's campaign.</p>
        <p>Another major Torricelli supporter, Lawrence Penna, a Hackensack, N.J., stockbroker, also pleaded guilty last year to making $20,000 in illegal contributions to the Torricelli campaign and $12,000 in illegal contributions to President Clinton's re-election effort. (Separately, Mr. Penna also pleaded guilty to illegally manipulating the stock price of a pharmaceutical company, defrauding investors of millions of dollars in a deal in which Mr. Torricelli's blind trust made a one-day profit of $50,000.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang, a shadowy New Jersey businessman who befriended Mr. Torricelli and later sought his help in at least two failed business schemes, was accused of crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice and funneling almost $54,000 in illegal contributions to the senator's campaign. He pleaded guilty on June 2 to five misdemeanor campaign-law violations and an unrelated conspiracy charge. One of Mr. Chang's former employees, Audrey Yu, and a Korean-born businessmen, Cha-Kuek Koo, pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Chang hide his contributions in the names of other people.</p>
        <p>But contrary to the assertions of Mr. Torricelli and Mr. Lowell, his lawyer, the interest of federal prosecutors did not end with the donors to his campaign. Lawyers said one area that the prosecutors are continuing to investigate is how Mr. Torricelli's staff members accounted for an in-kind contribution of $1,700 for the campaign's use of a plane that was paid for by one of Mr. Chang's companies, Bright &amp; Bright Corporation. The company was ultimately reimbursed for the flights, but the expense appears to have been charged after the campaign ended, two lawyers said. The prosecutors are also looking closely at how the campaign accounted for the use of the Fort Lee Hilton for one or more fund-raising events. Mr. Chang, who was a co-owner of the hotel, has since transferred his interest to his former wife, Angeline Cho.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang has provided extensive information to the authorities about these and other transactions, they said. His Washington lawyer, David Schertler, said he would not discuss what information his client had provided as part of his plea bargain.</p>
        <p>In recent months, as the focus of the investigation began to shift from Mr. Chang and his associates to the possible role of the campaign staff in the illegal contributions, the Justice Department's task force added a third prosecutor to the inquiry.</p>
        <p>But far from acknowledging concerns about his political future, Mr. Torricelli insisted that in a campaign that had some 20,000 donors, the illegal contributions that had been uncovered were isolated problems that could scarcely be avoided.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it's a problem for Al Gore right now, and it's a problem for a lot of my colleagues,'' he said. ''It's a problem, and it's embarrassing, but you know, it happened. No matter how careful you are, it's impossible given the size of these campaigns and thousands of donors, to ensure that somebody doesn't reimburse a contributor.''</p>
