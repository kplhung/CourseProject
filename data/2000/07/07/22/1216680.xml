        <p>Investors hammered shares in Ericsson yesterday despite a healthy increase in second-quarter earnings, as concern grew that the Swedish company might be losing ground in the battle for control of the thriving market for wireless phones.</p>
        <p>Shares of Ericsson fell $2.75, or 12 percent, to $19.8125 on the Nasdaq market, its deepest one-day decline in more than a year and a half. Much of the sell-off was attributed to Ericsson's warning that third-quarter sales of cell phones would be more sluggish than expected.</p>
        <p>Although Ericsson attributed part of the expected slowdown to a recent fire at an Albuquerque semiconductor plant operated by its main supplier, Royal Philips Electronics, some analysts questioned whether the company's overall mobile phone strategy the last several years was to blame.</p>
        <p>''Ericsson is paying the price for not seizing on the general direction of the industry,'' said Mark Roberts, a telecommunications analyst in the San Francisco office of First Union.</p>
        <p>Cell phones have emerged as one of the top-selling electronic items in the world, with more than $70 billion in revenue expected from the sale of 450 million units this year. And it increasingly appears that companies betting on the specialization of the devices, as opposed to their commoditization, are winning.</p>
        <p>This means that Nokia, the Finnish company that has succeeded in increasing its market share largely by providing a wide array of devices for consumers, is doing better than competitors. Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., and is the second-largest cell phone manufacturer, has been trying to follow Nokia's strategy in making the variety of devices a priority.</p>
        <p>Ericsson, meanwhile, the No. 3 manufacturer, has been derided for not structuring its operations to produce phones profitably. ''Their design cycles are slow, and they exposed themselves to a fire in a single factory,'' said Brian Modoff, a telecommunications analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ''I see no reason at all why they should be in the business of making phones.''</p>
        <p>In an effort to make its mobile phone operations profitable by the middle of next year, Ericsson said it was planning to focus on fewer production lines and increase research to market more attractive lower-end models. Kurt Hellstrom, Ericsson's chief executive, told investors in a conference call that the company had no plans to sell its division that manufactures mobile phones.</p>
        <p>When it comes to building networks for wireless operations, Ericsson's other main business, the company continued to show promise, with a 32 percent increase in sales in the second quarter. Ericsson has won some of the most lucrative contracts in Europe to build the next generation of networks that are expected to widen the spread of the wireless Internet.</p>
        <p>Network manufacturing activities largely fueled an increase in Ericsson's profit from operations in the second quarter, which climbed 46 percent to 2.35 billion kronor, or about $261 million.</p>
        <p>''Ericsson excels when it comes to the construction of networks, which is becoming a huge market,'' said Andrew Cole, who heads the wireless practice at Renaissance Strategy Worldwide.</p>
