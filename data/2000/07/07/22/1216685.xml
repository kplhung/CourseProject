        <p>Editorial urges House to reject Senate-passed bill to repeal a tax hike on high-income Social Security recipients passed in 1993 as part of Clinton's deficit-reduction plan (M)</p>

        <p>The Republican effort to pass tax cuts that are tilted in favor of wealthy families has until now been largely an election-year sideshow. This week's vote to cut taxes on married couples, including upper-income couples whom the code now subsidizes, and previous votes to eliminate the tax on wealthy estates were not large enough to get past President Clinton's promised vetoes. These tax plans will die.</p>
        <p>But another G.O.P. tax bill may not. The House will vote next week whether to repeal a tax hike on high-income Social Security recipients passed in 1993 as part of Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. The Senate has already voted 58 to 41 for repeal. The Clinton plan raised the portion of benefits subject to taxes to as much as 85 percent from 50 percent -- in effect raising the tax rate from about 15 percent to about 25 percent. The White House argued that it brought taxes on Social Security benefits closer in line with taxes on private pensions.</p>

        <p>The Republican effort to pass tax cuts that are tilted in favor of wealthy families has until now been largely an election-year sideshow. This week's vote to cut taxes on married couples, including upper-income couples whom the code now subsidizes, and previous votes to eliminate the tax on wealthy estates were not large enough to get past President Clinton's promised vetoes. These tax plans will die.</p>
        <p>But another G.O.P. tax bill may not. The House will vote next week whether to repeal a tax hike on high-income Social Security recipients passed in 1993 as part of Mr. Clinton's deficit-reduction plan. The Senate has already voted 58 to 41 for repeal. The Clinton plan raised the portion of benefits subject to taxes to as much as 85 percent from 50 percent -- in effect raising the tax rate from about 15 percent to about 25 percent. The White House argued that it brought taxes on Social Security benefits closer in line with taxes on private pensions.</p>
        <p>Yet even after the 1993 rate hike, the tax code continues to treat Social Security benefits more favorably than private pension benefits. Repeal would make the discrepancy worse, and hand an unwarranted $100 billion tax cut to the 15 percent or so wealthiest retirees over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Unfairness is not the only problem. The Social Security system is expected to run deficits over the next 75 years. This situation, if addressed immediately, could be eliminated with modest fixes. One would be to tax Social Security benefits fully as much as private pensions. Repeal of the 1993 tax hike would move in the opposite direction, eventually forcing Congress to tackle the deficits with stiff benefit cuts and tax hikes.</p>
        <p>The vote in the Senate for repeal was short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. But some of the Democrats who voted against repeal have warned their leadership that they are likely to change their votes if it comes back to the Senate after overwhelming approval in the House. That danger can be avoided if a large number of House members reject the repeal.</p>
