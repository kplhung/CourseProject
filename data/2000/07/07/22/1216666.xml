        <p>Alice D. Schroeder, an insurance analyst who managed to charm Warren E. Buffett and Maurice Greenberg, has left PaineWebber to join Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder, who has done perhaps the most detailed and exhaustive research of any analyst on Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, and Mr. Greenberg's American International Group, left PaineWebber on June 28. She began work at Morgan Stanley the next day.</p>

        <p>Alice D. Schroeder, an insurance analyst who managed to charm Warren E. Buffett and Maurice Greenberg, has left PaineWebber to join Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder, who has done perhaps the most detailed and exhaustive research of any analyst on Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, and Mr. Greenberg's American International Group, left PaineWebber on June 28. She began work at Morgan Stanley the next day.</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Schroeder nor PaineWebber would discuss her reasons for leaving. There was no indication that it was related to the purchase of PaineWebber by UBS, which was announced on July 12.</p>
        <p>Until last year, no large Wall Street firm had covered Berkshire Hathaway, which eschews the advice of investment bankers and in whose stock there is little trading.</p>
        <p>But, seeking a better public understanding of Berkshire after it had become an insurance giant with the purchase of General Re, a leading reinsurer, Mr. Buffett invited Ms. Schroeder to delve into his company.</p>
        <p>''It was clear to me that she was a superior analyst, both in her knowledge of the insurance business and in her willingness to do the legwork to garner facts,'' Mr. Buffett said then.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder, who has an M.B.A. from the University of Texas, met Mr. Buffett, and visited Berkshire's headquarters in Omaha and several of the company's businesses.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, she issued a report on A.I.G. that ran to nearly 300 pages and was based on five months' research in New York, China and several other countries.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Ms. Schroeder was named the No. 2 analyst on the Institutional Investor magazine's All-America Research Team in property casualty insurance.</p>
