        <p>In a series of raids throughout the Charlotte, N.C., area, federal officials today arrested 18 people in what they called a broad conspiracy to aid the militant Islamic organization Hezbollah, listed by  the government as a terrorist group.</p>
        <p>Those arrested, most of whom originally came from a neighborhood south of Beirut, were part of an active Hezbollah cell in North Carolina that trafficked in contraband cigarettes and laundered money that was then sent to the group's leaders in Lebanon, the government charged in an affidavit filed in Federal District Court in Charlotte.</p>
        <p>Although the authorities did not specify the amount transferred to Hezbollah, they did say that one suspect alone had sent it at least $1 million. Lending support to an organization designated by the government as terrorist is a federal crime.</p>
        <p>This cell meets weekly in Charlotte to plot ways to assist Hezbollah, the affidavit said, and ''is extremely anti-United States.'' The meetings invariably include a reading from the Ayatollah Khomeini, it said.</p>
        <p>None of the suspects were charged with any terrorist activities themselves. But the man identified as the leader of the group, Muhammad Youssef Hammoud, was described as having received military training from Hezbollah, and the government said he ''would not hesitate'' to carry out a terrorist act if ordered to do so. Another man, Said M. Harb, was accused of helping to purchase technical equipment for Hezbollah, including global positioning systems, night vision goggles and computers.</p>
        <p>Others in the group were also charged with aiding a terrorist organization, and with immigration and visa fraud, money laundering and racketeering.</p>
        <p>Much of the information about the suspects came from five informers who infiltrated the cell, said the affidavit, presented in court today by United States Attorney Mark T. Calloway.</p>
        <p>Most of the money sent overseas was raised through illegal cigarette trafficking, the government charged. Members of the group were said to have set up wholesale tobacco businesses as fronts and to have then smuggled large quantities of cigarettes from North Carolina, where the tax is 5 cents a pack, to Michigan, where it is 75 cents a pack. The difference in price, officials said, could result in a profit of $3,000 to $4,000 for every truckload of cigarettes sent to Michigan.</p>
        <p>Officials said about 250 federal, state and local agents took part in the raids, which began before dawn today and struck at homes and businesses alike.</p>
        <p>George Levkulich, who lives next door to one suspect, Ali Fayez Darwich, said vehicles from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms pulled up at Mr. Darwich's home early this morning and spent the whole day there, with agents removing much of the house's contents.</p>
        <p>''They took all kinds of things out of there, video cameras and stuff,'' Mr. Levkulich said. ''We asked them what was going on, and they said it was just a routine investigation. But I guess it wasn't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levkulich said he was amazed to hear that his neighbor was involved with Hezbollah. He knew Mr. Darwich as a painter who worked for a local home builder and supervised a crew of other painters. (In fact, he said another painter pulled up to the house today with his truck full of ladders and was immediately searched by federal agents.)</p>
        <p>''He helped me with a water pipe once,'' Mr. Levkulich said. ''He was a nice guy, a regular guy.''</p>
        <p>The government said Mr. Darwich was the brother of a ''well-known Hezbollah fighter'' in Lebanon and had regularly sent large sums of cash there via courier. He also participated in the cigarette scheme, as did his cousin, Mr. Hammoud, the affidavit said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darwich was charged with eight crimes, including marriage fraud: he is accused of having entered into a false marriage in order to receive American citizenship.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah, backed by Syria and Iran, is Israel's fiercest enemy in southern Lebanon, where it recently claimed victory when Israeli troops withdrew after 18 years.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the State Department designated Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization, based on its participation in the bombing that killed 241 United States marines in Beirut in 1983 and the kidnapping of Western hostages in Lebanon. The terrorism designation, renewed in October, makes it illegal to provide any material or other support to the group. Israel has long urged the United States to crack down on cells that it says are funneling money to the organization.</p>
        <p>The case against the suspects dates from 1997, a result of a local investigation into cigarette smuggling, which is widespread in North Carolina because of its low tobacco tax. The affidavit describes numerous cigarette buying and selling trips by the suspects, and gives a detailed record of their checking-account and credit-card dealings with cigarette distributors.</p>
        <p>Some of the proceeds from the smuggling have been invested in semi-legitimate businesses, like a tobacco shop and a Lebanese restaurant and deli in Charlotte, the government said.</p>
        <p>But the most personal information in the affidavit involves the group's ideological associations with Hezbollah, as described by the informers. It says, for example, that Mr. Hammoud frequently downloads songs and speeches from Hezbollah Web sites, which, it says, he uses in the cell's Thursday night meetings. He also has a collection of Hezbollah's  videotapes, which he plays at meetings to encourage donations, the government said.</p>
