        <p>For much of the late spring and summer, on issues ranging from education to the environment, Vice President Al Gore dissected and disparaged Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas, and the Texas governor never failed to fight back. He stood before television cameras to dismiss what he said were gross distortions, and his advisers churned out news releases that contradicted Mr. Gore's claims.</p>
        <p>But never has the Bush campaign mounted as furious a counteroffensive as it did day after day this week, in response to the vice president's latest salvo: that the Texas governor had mismanaged his state's finances, creating serious cost overruns that jeopardized the state's fiscal health. At long last, the Gore campaign seemed to hit a nerve or at least stoke an outrage that suggested the emergence of a line of attack that might have some staying power.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign set up conference calls between reporters and Republican and even Democratic lawmakers who said that an estimated $610 million in unanticipated expenses in Texas would be more than covered by a budget surplus of more than $1 billion. The campaign arranged for Mr. Bush to read a statement publicly denouncing Mr. Gore's tactics on a day when the governor had not planned to make any public appearances. His aides approached major television networks about booking Mr. Bush's senior advisers on weekend news programs. And the language Mr. Bush used to castigate his Democratic rival grew sharper than ever.</p>
        <p>''I now know what Bill Bradley meant when he said, 'How can we trust this man as president when we can't trust him as a candidate?' '' Mr. Bush told reporters today at his ranch near Crawford, referring to Mr. Gore's opponent in the Democratic primaries. ''I'm beginning to get a feel for why he uttered those words.''</p>
        <p>But was he also beginning to get a little nervous? Republican and Democratic strategists said that Mr. Gore's attack on Mr. Bush's experience and ability as a fiscal manager marked an important moment in the presidential race for several reasons, a situation clearly reflected by the Bush campaign's aggressive reaction.</p>
        <p>These strategists said that by calling Mr. Bush's aptitude for fiscal responsibility into question, Mr. Gore was challenging Mr. Bush on an issue -- the ability to manage the economy and sustain prosperity -- on which Republicans have often maintained an advantage over Democrats in voters' minds. Additionally, Mr. Gore was doing it in the context of the ever-expanding surplus projections that have become one of the brightest legacies of the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>''Bush's two main strengths are education and the economy, and you don't give when your opponent strikes at your strengths,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster. ''This is still a race about pocketbook issues, and it's where Bush's strengths really lie.''</p>
        <p>Other Republican strategists said that while voters often had difficulty making sense of competing education proposals and seldom supported candidates on the basis of rival philosophies about the environment, they understood money, and Mr. Gore's claim that Mr. Bush was not managing it properly amounted to perhaps the boldest attack yet on Mr. Bush's Texas record. That record, several strategist said, was perhaps the principal credential that Mr. Bush carried into this race.</p>
        <p>''Polling shows that the view of him as a successful governor is an essential reason why people believe he has the capacity to be a good president,'' said one Republican strategist. ''The Bush campaign can't afford to have that pillar shaken.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said that the vigor that the Bush campaign was bringing to the rebuttal of Mr. Gore's charges about the Texas budget was an offensive of its own, aimed at showing voters how readily Mr. Gore would alter facts to tear down his opponent.</p>
        <p>''The question's going to turn on Al Gore's credibility,'' he said in an interview today. ''This is so clear-cut. In the post-Clinton era, one of the key questions is whether voters want four more years of honesty problems.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore and his aides were bubbling with confidence today, saying that the questions they had raised about the Texas budget embodied and brought into vivid relief the larger concerns they had been trying to highlight about Mr. Bush's experience and what they see as his nonchalant approach to governing.</p>
        <p>To hammer home that last point, the Gore campaign has been repeating one of Mr. Bush's quips about the Texas budget. Asked about the budget recently, Mr. Bush alluded to his presidential hopes and said, ''I hope I'm not here to deal with it.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore, in a speech before labor leaders in Washington today, said, ''I think that this week will be looked back upon as a turning point.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign also clearly saw its current line of attack in the context of Mr. Bush's campaign proposal for an enormous tax cut, something that voters have not demonstrated a sharp appetite for and that Mr. Gore has said would endanger continued prosperity.</p>
        <p>The budget situation is portrayed differently by the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign cited recently released estimates about the cost overruns, primarily in its Medicaid and state prison programs, as evidence that the state budget was out of whack. Mr. Bush's aides said that the state's expected surplus of $1.1 billion would take care of the expenses, and on Thursday, when Mr. Gore came to Texas to denounce Mr. Bush's record on the governor's home turf, the state's Republican comptroller held a news conference in which she raised the surplus estimate to $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore did not seem to be cowed, and the Bush campaign stepped up its fight today. Mr. Fleischer said that it had asked Republican members of the House and Senate budget committees to hold news conferences in their districts and talk to reporters to make the case that Mr. Gore was playing fast, loose and dishonest with the facts.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign also arranged a conference call so that reporters could talk to Representative John Kasich, an Ohio Republican, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.</p>
        <p>''There's no deficit in Texas; there's a big surplus, and the vice president has the gall to try to distort this,'' Mr. Kasich said. ''Texas has had six consecutive years of budget surpluses, balanced budgets, increased funding for education and tax cuts.''</p>
        <p>''By contrast,'' Mr. Kasich continued, ''four of the eight budgets submitted by the Clinton-Gore administration over the past eight years have left the budget in deficits.''</p>
        <p>Several strategists said that part of what the Bush campaign was doing was serving notice to Mr. Gore, at a time when the presidential race is heating up and more voters may begin to pay attention, that it would not let any charge go unanswered.</p>
        <p>David Doak, a Democratic strategist, said that the motivation behind the response by Mr. Bush and his advisers might be pure anger, amplified by the awareness that Mr. Gore was taking a page out of the kind of assault Mr. Bush's father waged against former Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts during the 1988 presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''Never underestimate the possibility that he may have just made Bush mad,'' Mr. Doak said. ''These guys are human. They have emotions and feelings and pride and competitiveness.''</p>
