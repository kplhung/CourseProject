        <p>Call it bad luck, bad timing, bad judgment or all of the above: Aetna, an old-line insurance company, transformed itself into a hard-charging, tightly run health care company four years ago, just in time to become a main target of the backlash against managed care, especially the kind Aetna was selling.</p>
        <p>This week, the company was still struggling with the consequences. Putting a brave face on it, William H. Donaldson, chairman and chief executive since a management shake-up in February, hailed ''a turnaround opportunity'' to put Aetna's health care business ''on the right track.''</p>
        <p>Under pressure from investors annoyed at its stock price, Aetna agreed on Thursday to sell its lucrative financial services and international business to the ING Group of Amsterdam for $5 billion in cash. Mr. Donaldson said the new, slimmed-down Aetna, still the nation's biggest health insurer, would ''redefine the company's business model.''</p>
        <p>Almost half the 19.5 million Americans covered by Aetna are in strict health maintenance organizations, which generally save money by requiring patients to get permission from a primary care doctor before seeing a specialist or taking a test.</p>
        <p>But the market has changed. ''Our world is different than it was 10 years ago,'' said Dr. Michael A. Stocker, president and chief executive of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. ''In a tight labor market, employees are not happy about more cost-sharing. This is a luxurious time for luxurious products.''</p>
        <p>Low-cost H.M.O.'s were a big success for U.S. Healthcare, Aetna's core unit, into the early 1990's, when employers were shocked by sharply rising health costs and holding onto employees was not a big concern.</p>
        <p>But as the economy roared and health care inflation slowed in the mid-1990's, insurers like Cigna, the UnitedHealth Group and Wellpoint Health Networks and other Blue Cross companies catered to customers who demanded more choice of doctors and fewer restrictions.</p>
        <p>Managing health care ''clearly is changing into a much more complicated business that requires absolute focus on the fundamentals,'' said H. Edward Hanway, president and chief executive of Cigna. ''It is not any different for any of us.''</p>
        <p>Slow to change, Aetna is now playing catch up, trying to remake itself as a kinder, gentler company that causes fewer hassles for consumers, doctors and hospitals. Mr. Donaldson said it would soon offer new types of health coverage to meet consumer demand for ''more flexibility and choice.''</p>
        <p>The sale to ING came on the heels of an embarrassing warning by Aetna on Tuesday that it had fallen short of expected second-quarter earnings. The cause, it said, was higher-than-expected medical costs in its core H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the warning meant Aetna was not paying enough attention to the most important and difficult task in managed care: anticipating future costs and setting rates to cover bills that often do not show up until months later.</p>
        <p>Investors are slow to forgive slip-ups that undermine earnings. Aetna shares dropped 20 percent this week, closing at $57.25, even though the ING deal included a payout of $35 for each Aetna share plus one share of a new Aetna Inc. Analysts said other managed care companies did not share Aetna's special problems. But except for Wellpoint, health care stocks lost ground this week.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Aetna would have to raise its rates 13 to 14 percent next year, at a time when competitors may be raising premiums by only 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donaldson added that the new, more flexible coverage would be priced accordingly, indicating that rates would be higher for the new types of coverage than for the company's more restrictive H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing wrong with being kinder and gentler,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, ''but they must charge corporate America for that strategy.''</p>
        <p>Setting up the problems Aetna faces now, Mr. Donaldson's predecessor as chairman and chief executive, Richard L. Huber, spent $11 billion on a three-year buying spree. He scooped up three big managed care companies: U.S. Healthcare in 1996, Nylcare and Prudential Health Care in 1998. Aetna is still working on having them integrated into its information systems and culture.</p>
        <p>The latest and most problematical deal was the purchase of Prudential Health, an enormous money-loser. Investors hope to learn early next month, when Aetna reports on second-quarter earnings, whether the Prudential unit is still on track to reach break-even this winter, despite its recent rising medical costs.</p>
        <p>Time is running out for a turnaround at Prudential because deal-sweetening post-purchase paybacks to Aetna from the seller, the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America, will end next year.</p>
        <p>The company says it will have more to say about Prudential and other murky questions, including its latest membership numbers, when it formally reports on earnings on Aug. 4.</p>
        <p>With the mergers, Aetna became the biggest health insurer in New York and New Jersey and among the top three in Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. When it bought Nylcare for $1.1 billion, it had so many Texas members that it was forced to sell health plans with 460,000 members to Texas Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Blue Cross paid $420 million for the plans.</p>
        <p>The health care roster included 676,000 people in Medicare H.M.O.'s, which will drop to 320,000 next year when it shuts Medicare health plans in 11 states. Mr. Donaldson has said some of the plans are ''egregiously'' unprofitable. Suggesting further shrinkage in the membership rolls, Mr. Donaldson also made it clear that Aetna plans to discontinue other unprofitable lines in some markets.</p>
        <p>The transformation of the company started in 1995, when Aetna Life and Casualty, as it was then called, sold its property and casualty business for $4.1 billion to Travelers and bought an H.M.O. company, U.S. Healthcare, for a price that, in hindsight, is widely deemed excessive.</p>
        <p>Some Wall Street analysts say the price, $9 billion, was as much as three times what the company was worth. ''They got taken,'' said Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. Leonard Abramson, the founder of U.S. Healthcare, ''got the best deal ever done in the history of deals,'' Mr. Richter said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abramson, now 67, resigned from the Aetna board last month. Under the 1996 deal, he still gets $3 million a year as a consultant and is due $10 million more when that contract ends next summer. ''There were contracts for his relatives and employees, a $25 million airplane and gas money for the plane,'' Mr. Richter added. Mr. Abramson did not respond to requests for an interview.</p>
        <p>Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said the price paid for U.S. Healthcare was only ''a moderate premium'' above the H.M.O.'s stock. But analysts recall that managed care stocks soared after Aetna maladroitly said it was planning to buy an H.M.O.</p>
        <p>''U.S. Healthcare had what we were looking for,'' Ms. Oberdorf said, ''information systems expertise, management of the stronger forms of managed care, a strong presence in several key markets, and a model that could be replicated.''</p>
        <p>But replicating the tightly disciplined U.S. Healthcare model infuriated many doctors who were used to the more relaxed ways of the old Aetna. The U.S. Healthcare team insisted that doctors accept low-paying H.M.O. customers or give up all their Aetna patients. Doctors were paid a flat monthly fee called capitation for H.M.O. members, which put them at risk when patients had expensive illnesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huber minced no words in confronting critics, and soon Aetna was fighting off lawsuits around the country.</p>
        <p>Without giving away the store, Mr. Donaldson has tried to repair relations with the public and physicians. He announced that capitation would be dropped in several states for individual doctors and small group practices, who would be paid with the traditional fees for service.</p>
        <p>Most senior officials from U.S. Healthcare who took over Aetna after the merger have since been pushed out. Aetna is seeking a new health care chief, no easy task considering the challenges.</p>
        <p>James H. Dickerson, now president of Caremark Rx Inc., a pharmacy managed care company, amused analysts with an all too realistic joke back in 1997, when he moved from U.S. Healthcare to Aetna as chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Dickerson told it, a new finance chief found three envelopes in his desk ''to be opened in time of trouble.'' As trouble arrived, he opened the first envelope and read, ''Blame your predecessor.'' The second message was ''Blame industry conditions.'' The third was ''Prepare three envelopes.''</p>
        <p>The tale was timely for Mr. Dickerson. He was shown the door a few weeks later.</p>
