      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on the decline of Senate and rise of the statehouse as an arena in which a politician can get things done and build a record on which to seek higher office; cites Sen John G Torricelli's interest in running for governor of New Jersey</p>

        <p>It is too soon to know whether questions surrounding fund-raising activities in Senator Robert  Torricelli's 1996 campaign will derail his ambitions to become the next governor of New Jersey. What intrigues us at the moment is Mr. Torricelli's eagerness to leave the Senate after only four years, and the light this sheds on the relative appeal of the Senate and the statehouses. The Senate has been described as ''the greatest deliberative body on earth.'' Even so, Mr. Torricelli wants out, believing that as a governor he has a better chance of getting things done and, further, a better chance to achieve higher office should he ever seek it.</p>
        <p>He is not alone in that view. Among politicians who seek enhanced power and greater influence over social policy, the Senate has declined in value while the governorships have risen. Leverage is one factor. Mr. Torricelli is but one of 100 senators. An individual senator can shape legislation and, on very rare occasions, claim authorship. But unless a senator heads a committee, his or her power is incremental.</p>

        <p>It is too soon to know whether questions surrounding fund-raising activities in Senator Robert  Torricelli's 1996 campaign will derail his ambitions to become the next governor of New Jersey. What intrigues us at the moment is Mr. Torricelli's eagerness to leave the Senate after only four years, and the light this sheds on the relative appeal of the Senate and the statehouses. The Senate has been described as ''the greatest deliberative body on earth.'' Even so, Mr. Torricelli wants out, believing that as a governor he has a better chance of getting things done and, further, a better chance to achieve higher office should he ever seek it.</p>
        <p>He is not alone in that view. Among politicians who seek enhanced power and greater influence over social policy, the Senate has declined in value while the governorships have risen. Leverage is one factor. Mr. Torricelli is but one of 100 senators. An individual senator can shape legislation and, on very rare occasions, claim authorship. But unless a senator heads a committee, his or her power is incremental.</p>
        <p>A governor, by contrast, is a chief executive, an agenda-setter and architect. Governors make things happen. Congress rewrote the welfare laws. But it is governors like John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin -- flush with cash from Washington -- who are actually remaking welfare in America. It is the governors who can turn bad schools into good ones. It was a single governor, George Ryan of Illinois, who energized the national debate on capital punishment by imposing a moratorium on executions.</p>
        <p>The Senate has other liabilities. It requires a personality capable of enduring endless delays while engaging in tedious negotiations that may produce nothing at all. Nor can senators any longer count on foreign policy issues to help them build a national reputation. The end of the cold war and the increasing complexity of global issues have effectively shrunk the stage that yielded such big players as William Fulbright and Henry Jackson.</p>
        <p>But the Senate's main deficiency is that for someone who aspires to broad influence and the mantle of leadership, it is simply not the place to amass a portfolio of politically portable achievements. John McCain came to the 2000 Republican primaries identified mainly with an unsuccessful if valiant effort to reform the campaign financing system. Bill Bradley came to the Democratic primary identified mainly with tax reform. Energetic governors, by contrast, can write a legislative resume that cuts across many fields and can be marketed as a coherent body of work.</p>
        <p>This may account for the decreasing importance of the Senate and increasing importance of the statehouses as sources of presidential timber. From 1960 until 1976, the Senate provided nearly all the party nominees and most of the serious candidates for the nomination. Former senators -- Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon -- occupied the White House from 1961 to 1974. But for 20 of the last 24 years, governors have run the place -- Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, already outlining the makings of a campaign platform, said that as governor he would establish a statewide day-care system, stop suburban sprawl, give prescription drug benefits to the middle class and broaden the public school system to include 4-year-olds. Any one of these would be a career-defining achievement for a senator. But for a prospective governor, such an agenda is not far-fetched.</p>
