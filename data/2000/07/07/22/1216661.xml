        <p>Bill T. Jones frequently talked as he danced in ''The Breathing Show,'' his impressive solo on Thursday night at La Guardia High School. But even when his voice fell silent, he still spoke through the eloquence of his moving body.</p>
        <p>He emphasized unions of thoughts and actions and words and deeds throughout the 90-minute piece, which was staged in its New York premiere under the auspices of his Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000. The solo, commissioned by the Hancher Auditorium of the University of Iowa and the National Endowment for the Arts, was presented in February at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones made no attempt to disguise his audible breathing in ''The Breathing Show,'' which became a hymn to life. Much of the time he moved to recordings by composers as various as Schubert, Mozart and Thelonious Monk. There was also original music by Daniel Bernard Roumain, who wandered across the stage playing plaintive phrases on a violin. Mr. Jones's actions fit the moods of the scores.</p>
        <p>But occasionally he interrupted even emotionally fraught moments to speak to the audience. He reminisced about teaching dance to schoolchildren. He paid tribute to Isadora Duncan and confessed that repeated listening to Schubert made him realize that ''I've come out as a Romantic.'' He invited spectators to join him in a meditative Zen breathing exercise. Most seemed willing to accept that invitation.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Jones was usually serious, he also introduced pleasantly silly jokes into the proceedings. Thus he had Bjorn G. Amelan, who designed the production, which included an attractive mobile, make repeated appearances in which he inflated and punctured balloons. Come to think of it, those sight gags were not totally frivolous: after all, inflating balloons does require breath, and breath was a theme of ''The Breathing Show.''</p>
        <p>What helped bind the miscellaneous events together was a long phrase filled with swinging movements that Mr. Jones introduced at the start of the work. Then, like a composer devising variations on a musical theme, he later offered different versions of it. In one he gave a kinesiological analysis of every step as he did it. In another he spoke aloud the random thoughts that were supposedly running through his mind as he danced, among them reflections on love, fear, Harlem, India, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and Hollywood movies.</p>
        <p>One might wonder if these were really his thoughts at the time or if they were statements prepared in advance to create certain theatrical effects. No matter. Art involves craft, and these observations seemed typical of the free associations a dancer's mind might conjure up.</p>
        <p>Dance sequences were separated by two films. Abraham Ravett's ''Garden'' depicted a garden dominated by large stones. And in his commentaries, Mr. Jones echoed Voltaire in ''Candide'' by urging all to ''cultivate our gardens.''</p>
        <p>Even more striking was ''Ghostcatching,'' in which Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar used computer-generated images to create illusions of apparitions floating through space and drawing chalk lines and patterns on otherwise empty air. Whereas the dance onstage celebrated the flesh, this film celebrated the spirit. The production as a whole celebrated both.</p>
        <p>''If you call life, it will come,'' Mr. Jones assured his audience. ''The Breathing Show'' was proof of that.</p>
