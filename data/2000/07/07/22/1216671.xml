        <p>A day after pleasant surprises from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, investors turned their focus back to corporate earnings yesterday and stocks sagged, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 2.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average down 1 percent.</p>
        <p>But bond prices rallied a little as hopes persisted that new signs of slowing consumer spending and economic growth would persuade Fed policy makers to leave interest rates alone when they next meet, on Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>In the oil market, the price of crude oil plunged 4.1 percent, to less than $30 a barrel, as it appeared more probable that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would go along with Saudi Arabia's call to increase daily production by 500,000 barrels.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, both stocks and bonds rallied sharply after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, was more positive than expected about the economic outlook. Although he clearly did not rule out future interest rate increases, he seemed to surprise investors with his detailed presentation of reasons for believing that the economy could be slowing to a manageable, noninflationary pace.</p>
        <p>But there were some disappointments on the earnings front yesterday. Eastman Kodak reported a 4.5 percent rise in second-quarter earnings but said that its market share in the United States had slipped this year. Its stock was down 1 7/8, to 58. BorgWarner, which makes engine turbochargers, fell 15/16, to 36, after its second-quarter earnings per share of $1.51 missed Wall Street estimates by 5 cents. Lexmark International, a maker of computer printers, said that its third-quarter profit would come in below expectations. Its shares plunged 14 1/4, or 22.3 percent, to 49 3/4.</p>
        <p>Semiconductor stocks also declined on concerns about chip sales for the rest of the year, with Intel falling 4 1/2, to 138 3/16, and Motorola sliding 1 1/4, to 361 3/16.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq index fell 90.11 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,094.45, while the Dow dropped 110.31, or 1 percent, to 10,733.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slumped 15.38, or 1 percent, to 1,480.19.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Nasdaq was down 3.6 percent, the Dow 0.7 percent and the S.&amp; P. 500 2 percent. For the year, the S.&amp; P. 500 and the Nasdaq are up less than a percentage point while the Dow is still off 6.6 percent.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.98 percent from 6.00 percent on Thursday, while the price rose 4/32, to 103 23/32. The yield on the 10-year note has been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last five weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.79 percent from 5.81 percent as its price rose 11/32, to 106 19/32.</p>
        <p>The seesaw battle in the oil market over where the price is heading has been going on since July 3, when Saudi Arabia unexpectedly announced that it was ready to pump 500,000 more barrels a day if the price did not drop.</p>
        <p>But other members of OPEC immediately opposed the Saudi plan, and reports about negotiations were inconsistent, indicating more oil to come one day and no more oil the next. Then after an OPEC official said earlier this week that there was no need to pump more oil, Saudi Arabia quietly made clear that it was shipping more oil by contacting oil brokers.</p>
        <p>''The market finally believes Saudi Arabia,'' said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company. ''Why it took so long, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday in New York, the price of oil for September delivery fell $1.21, or 4.1 percent, to $28.56 a barrel, the lowest price since mid-May.</p>
