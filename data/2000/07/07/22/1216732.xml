        <p>In what both sides consider an all-out war for control of the Reform Party, opponents of Patrick J. Buchanan's efforts to win the party's presidential nomination say they have evidence of irregularities by his campaign in the primary that could disqualify him from the balloting.</p>
        <p>A panel of party officials has been appointed to audit the petition signatures collected by Mr. Buchanan and by his opponent, John Hagelin, a physicist who has twice run for president under the Natural Law Party banner.</p>
        <p>Petition signers are people who would otherwise be sent primary ballots for voting, which began this month and concludes when the party convention begins in three weeks. If the signatures cannot be verified as those of party members or people who have requested a ballot, they would be invalidated, and the candidate who submitted the names could be removed from the primary.</p>
        <p>The audit is expected to be completed next week. Several party leaders who oppose Mr. Buchanan said they were certain that the results would show his campaign violated the rules by submitting the names of people who were not qualified to vote.</p>
        <p>''The expectation is that the Buchanan campaign committed widespread fraud in attempting to corrupt the process and steal the nomination,'' said Jim Mangia, the national party secretary who is leading the campaign against Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, along with Russell J. Verney, an associate of Ross Perot, the party founder.</p>
        <p>The Buchanan campaign denied the claims, saying the audit would prove that the accusations are unfounded. ''Mr. Mangia is trying to invent any way he can to subvert the process because he can't defeat us legitimately,'' said Brian Doherty, a spokesman for the Buchanan campaign.</p>
        <p>Questions about the 400,000 signatures submitted by Mr. Buchanan were first raised by Mr. Hagelin and his supporters, who are waging a long-shot campaign to win the nomination. But the cause was rapidly embraced by Reform leaders who are concerned that Mr. Buchanan would change the ideological direction of the party, infusing it with a social agenda.</p>
        <p>Officials said they became suspicious when the petitions included thousands of names from states like New York, California and South Carolina, where Reform candidates were not required to gather signatures because the party was already on the November ballot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mangia and the campaign managers for Mr. Hagelin, Kingsley Brooks and Nadine Padower, said many of the names are Buchanan supporters and contributors from his days in the Republican Party who have no connection to the Reform Party, which Mr. Buchanan joined late last year.</p>
        <p>The audit panel, which has four members and includes a representative from each campaign, will try to sort through the names and determine if there are irregularities.</p>
        <p>Harry Kresky, an official with the Reform Party in New York and a panel member, said the audit would probably start on Monday, assuming the two candidates have provided the material needed to validate each signature.</p>
        <p>If improprieties are found, the panel would make a recommendation to the presidential nominating committee for a disposition that could be appealed to the executive committee.</p>
        <p>Even if he were disqualified from the primary, Mr. Buchanan could still become the party nominee if two-thirds of the delegates attending the convention next month in Long Beach, Calif., voted to invalidate the primary and install Mr. Buchanan.</p>
