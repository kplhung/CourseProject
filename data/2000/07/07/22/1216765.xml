        <p>Although he is the defending champion, Tom Jenkins said playing with Arnold Palmer yesterday helped him raise his game in the opening round of the inaugural Instinet Classic at Jasna Polana in Princeton, N.J., the only T.P.C. event on the Senior PGA Tour in the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia area.</p>
        <p>Jenkins shot a seven-under-par 65 and held a two-shot lead in the tournament, which was previously known as the Bell Atlantic Classic and played at three sites in Pennsylvania.</p>

        <p>Although he is the defending champion, Tom Jenkins said playing with Arnold Palmer yesterday helped him raise his game in the opening round of the inaugural Instinet Classic at Jasna Polana in Princeton, N.J., the only T.P.C. event on the Senior PGA Tour in the New York-New Jersey-Philadelphia area.</p>
        <p>Jenkins shot a seven-under-par 65 and held a two-shot lead in the tournament, which was previously known as the Bell Atlantic Classic and played at three sites in Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Jenkins attributed Palmer's presence for inspiring him to play a round that included eight birdies and a bogey. When there is so much attention, Jenkins said of the large gallery following Palmer, you get focused on what you're doing and the adrenaline keeps going. My bubbles started percolating when I found out the pairings.</p>
        <p>Palmer was playing in his 1,000th official PGA event, joining Miller Barber, Gay Brewer and Dave Eichelberger as the only players to accomplish the feat. He was honored before he teed off and received a huge ovation when he birdied the last hole, the 549-yard par 5, to finish the day at one-under 71. It was his best round of the year.</p>
        <p>Jenkins was two shots ahead of Jerry McGee, Jim Ferree and Gil Morgan, who all shot 67 on the 6,893-yard layout. For McGee, who underwent tongue and throat surgery for cancer 15 months ago and has lost 44 pounds, the 67 came on his 57th birthday.</p>

        <p>TOLEDO RETAINS LEAD: Esteban Toledo shot a five-under-par 67 yesterday to stay in front of the field after two rounds in the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y. Coupled with his opening 64, Toledo was at 13-under 131, three shots ahead of the defending champion, Brad Faxon, and Glen Hnatiuk of Canada.</p>
        <p>Another shot back were Brian Gay, Scott McCarron and Dick Mast, who bogeyed his first hole of the day before rallying with two eagles to finish with a 64.</p>
        <p>Jerry Kelly also got back into contention with a 63 that included eight birdies on the front nine. After his best round on tour, Kelly was tied at seven under with Carl Paulson and Richard Zokol.</p>
        <p>Play, which was delayed three and a half hours by rain, was suspended because of darkness with 30 players still on the course. They will complete their rounds today.</p>
