        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>NEVADANS CANCEL CASINO NIGHT  A Las Vegas-style casino night that was to be the Nevada Republican Party's biggest fund-raiser during next month's Republican National Convention in Philadelphia has run into a bit of trouble. It turns out that gambling is illegal in Pennsylvania -- even if it's with fake money and chips. The Nevada delegation had hoped to raise as much as $100,000 during a $100-per-person gala at which participants would be given fake money and chips to wager for prizes like a free trip to a real casino in Las Vegas. But the gala was canceled when State Attorney General Mike Fisher advised that it was illegal. ''It was going to be a lot of fun,'' lamented Ryan Erwin, executive director of the Nevada Republican Party. ''Better to be safe than sorry.'' Mr. Fisher, a Republican, encouraged the Nevadans and all other conventioneers to ''enjoy all the legal cultural, historic and sporting activities Philadelphia has to offer.''</p>

        <p>POLL PREDICTS WANING INTEREST  About 4 in 10 Americans say they have no plans to watch any of the national political conventions, a poll has found. That figure is about double the percentage who reported at this point four years ago that they had no plans to look in on the conventions. In the new poll, from Harvard's Vanishing Voter project, 43 percent of those surveyed said they did not plan to watch the Republican convention, and almost that many, 38 percent, said they had no plans to watch the Democratic convention. When the same question was posed in a Yankelovich Partners poll in 1996, just over a fifth of those polled said they would not watch the conventions. The Harvard poll, conducted last week and covering 1,000 adults, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NADER OFF THE OKLAHOMA BALLOT  The Green Party has come up 105 signatures short in its bid to place its presidential nominee, Ralph Nader, on the November ballot in Oklahoma. Oklahoma election officials say that petitions submitted by Nader supporters by Monday's filing deadline contained only 36,097 of the 36,202 signatures required. Lori Theis, a Green Party official in Oklahoma City, said that volunteers actually collected more than enough signatures to qualify Mr. Nader but that some signature petitions did not make it to the Capitol by Monday's 5 p.m. deadline. ''They're all sitting at my house, dated before the deadline,'' she said. ''To know the signatures were out there, this is very disappointing.'' Aides to Mr. Nader say that despite the setback in Oklahoma, he still expects to qualify for the ballot in most states well before Election Day.</p>
