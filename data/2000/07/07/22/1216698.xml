        <p>Amgen Inc. won another round yesterday in its patent infringement lawsuit against Transkaryotic Therapies when the judge overseeing the case eliminated some of the arguments Transkaryotic was trying to use in its defense. Still, lawyers and analysts said the trial, which is expected to last at least until September, was far from decided.</p>
        <p>Transkaryotic, which is known as TKT, wants to sell its own version of erythropoietin, or EPO, the best-selling drug in the biotechnology industry. TKT says it can make EPO, which is used to treat anemia, in a manner that does not infringe Amgen's patents.</p>
        <p>As part of its defense, TKT is trying to persuade Judge William G. Young of the Federal District Court in Boston to declare Amgen's patents invalid. One set of arguments it made was that Amgen's claims did not warrant a patent because they were obvious and anticipated by the previous work of others.</p>
        <p>The judge, who is trying the case without a jury, ruled against TKT on those points yesterday. But he did not rule on whether TKT infringed any patents.</p>
        <p>Elise Wang, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the ruling weakened the position of TKT and its partner, Aventis S.A., the big European drug company that is also a defendant in the suit. Shares of TKT fell $3.875, to $31.125, while Amgen rose $3.9375, to $78.</p>
        <p>Still, there are other grounds on which Amgen's patents can be declared invalid. TKT's main argument is expected to be that the claims in Amgen's patents are broad and seek to cover things beyond what Amgen invented. It is also arguing that Amgen defrauded the Patent Office by withholding information.</p>
        <p>''They still have half a dozen defenses left,'' said Jonas V. Alsenas, portfolio manager for ING Furman Selz Asset Management.</p>
        <p>EPO is a protein normally produced in kidneys that stimulates production of red blood cells. Amgen makes it by cloning the human gene for EPO and putting it in hamster ovary cells that are grown in culture. TKT puts DNA into human cells grown in culture to turn on the EPO gene, which is usually dormant.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high because EPO accounts for roughly $2 billion in sales for both Amgen and its licensee, Johnson &amp; Johnson. The industry is watching closely because if TKT prevails, it might also make versions of other drugs. However, each such attempt by the company is likely to face a separate patent challenge.</p>
