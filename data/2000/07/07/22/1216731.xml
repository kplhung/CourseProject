        <p>In their first competition since Wimbledon, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati showed last night what can happen when lower stakes meet lowered expectations.</p>
        <p>The two slogged through their quarterfinal at the A.&amp;P. Classic exhibition tournament here before the sixth-ranked Seles turned up her baseline attack to beat No. 15 Capriati, 6-4, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''Both of us had our spurts, both of us were fantastic and both of us at times were inconsistent,'' Seles said.</p>
        <p>The rare fantastic parts came after the two shared five broken serves and a slew of unforced errors in the first set. In the second set, their ground strokes finally warmed up on a cool, breezy night. They moved each other around in crisp rallies that gave the 6,100 fans what they paid for.</p>
        <p>But Capriati's inability to hold serve ushered her out quickly. Seles broke her for the fifth time to go ahead by 3-2 in the second set and never relinquished the lead.</p>
        <p>''When you can't hold serve, it's because the return was so good,'' Capriati said.</p>
        <p>Seles will meet Sandra Cacic, a 6-2, 6-7 (6), 7-5 winner over Tracy Almeda-Singian earlier, in one semifinal on Saturday. Amanda Coetzer, ranked 12th, faces No. 19 Anna Kournikova in the other match.</p>
        <p>But brackets do not mean much here. The players are trying to sharpen their skills for the United States Open next month. Seles has the added incentive of playing in the Sydney Olympics afterward.</p>
