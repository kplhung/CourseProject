        <p>Washington running back Stephen Davis ended his holdout yesterday, agreeing to a one-year contract that will pay him $3.532 million.</p>
        <p>Davis, the National Football Conference's leading rusher last year, had hoped for a long-term deal with a huge signing bonus. But the sides agreed to a $1 million signing bonus and a salary of $2.532 million for the 2000 season.</p>

        <p>The $3.532 million is the minimum one-year total the Redskins had to offer when they designated Davis their franchise player to keep him from becoming a free agent. There's also a major compromise: the Redskins cannot name Davis their franchise player again at the end of the season.</p>
