        <p>The New York Stock Exchange says that open positions of short sales fell 1.7 percent in the most recent monthly period. Uncovered short sales totaled 4.23 billion shares for the month ended July 14, compared with 4.31 billion shares the previous month. The most recent short interest was equal to 1.4 percent of the total shares listed, the Big Board said on Thursday.</p>
        <p>In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss. Uncovered short sales -- or those with open positions -- are shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase.</p>

        <p>Large short-sale positions have long been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among investors. But the level of short interest can fluctuate as a result of complex trading strategies involving options, futures and derivatives.</p>
        <p>On the smaller American Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales fell 2.2 percent the most recent month. Short sales totaled 175.4 million shares, compared with 179.4 million shares a month earlier, the exchange, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers, said on Thursday.</p>
