        <p>More than 50 South Jersey Democrats announced their support for Senator Robert G. Torricelli today in his bid to supplant James E. McGreevey as the party's presumptive nominee for governor.</p>

        <p>More than 50 South Jersey Democrats announced their support for Senator Robert G. Torricelli today in his bid to supplant James E. McGreevey as the party's presumptive nominee for governor.</p>
        <p>The senator's backers claimed that the show of support, which included top officials in three counties and two county Democratic Party chairmen, would be the first in a series of endorsements as unstoppable as toppling dominoes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McGreevey's loyalists dismissed the endorsements as a weak showing, signaled that they would announce their own South Jersey supporters on Saturday, and argued that the region's Democrats remained divided, at best, in the governor's race.</p>
        <p>While such endorsements are unlikely to influence many voters, they are considered critical at this stage in the McGreevey-Torricelli showdown. The senator is seeking to prove he would be the choice of an overwhelming majority of Democrats, and needs to show he has the support of the most influential party leaders. Mr. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, is striving to prove he can withstand Mr. Torricelli's challenge, and must prevent defections from his ranks.</p>
        <p>Those endorsing Mr. Torricelli today included the Democratic chairmen in Camden and Burlington Counties; the freeholder directors -- the top elected officials -- in Camden, Cumberland and Gloucester Counties; the mayors of Atlantic City and Cherry Hill; former Representative William J. Hughes; seven assemblymen; and two state senators.</p>
        <p>''This is an endorsement by the Who's Who of Democratic leadership in southern New Jersey,'' said George E. Norcross III, the Camden County power broker.</p>
        <p>But one of the officials listed as favoring Mr. Torricelli withdrew his endorsement tonight, saying he had been bamboozled. Tom Pankok, the Salem County Democratic chairman, said he had agreed to add his name to the list only because he had been told that counterparts in Cumberland and Gloucester Counties had already done so.</p>
        <p>''I am going to remain neutral,'' Mr. Pankok said. ''I'm so sick and tired of hearing so much misinformation. I don't want to talk about endorsements or anything till after the November election.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey refused to discuss the list of Torricelli supporters, except to say he remained confident he would survive the senator's challenge.</p>
