        <p>Thousands of police officers, seven deep and shoulder to shoulder, stood at silent, white-gloved attention yesterday along a half-mile stretch of Amboy Road on Staten Island to pay tribute to a fellow officer who died while chasing a motorcyclist.</p>
        <p>Row upon row of officers, some squinting into the bright morning sun before an emotional funeral Mass at Our Lady Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church, watched as a hearse carrying the body of Officer John Kelly drove slowly past elm trees and wood-frame houses.</p>
        <p>The procession on the two-lane street was led by 80 rumbling police motorcycles, rolling in pairs, and the Police Department's Emerald Society Pipe Band, marching slowly and silently but for a steady drumbeat and the slow toll of the church bell. The drums could be heard well before the procession arrived outside the church, despite the black fabric draped around them to mute the sound.</p>
        <p>The drumbeat stopped when the 31-year-old officer's coffin was lifted from the hearse and carried past an honor guard made up of officers from police precincts all around the city. Only the quiet sobs of his mother-in-law could be heard over the church bell. His wife, Officer Patricia Duffy, stood beside her mother and next to Officer Kelly's three brothers, all police officers, as the coffin was carried into the church.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly died on Monday afternoon after his unmarked patrol car crashed into a utility pole in the Bloomfield section of Staten Island while he was chasing a motorcyclist driving with a stolen license plate. On Wednesday, the police arrested Guido Tritto, 43, on charges of second-degree manslaughter.</p>
        <p>At the foot of the church's sweeping lawn, people from the neighborhood, some wearing shorts and T-shirts, stood in small clusters under the shade trees lining Huguenot Road, watching the somber proceedings.</p>
        <p>Inside the small brick church, which seats only 500 people, many of the mourners cried, wiping tears away with tissues, sleeves or white-gloved hands.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Patrick J. Lynch, the police union president, who all spoke after the Mass celebrated by Msgr. James Dorney, dozens of politicians and senior police officials also crowded into the church.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Safir eulogized Mr. Kelly as the kind of officer who spent his own money on night-vision goggles to better catch car thieves. And the mayor read a letter from a crime victim who had been helped by Mr. Kelly and another officer last month and had written on June 6 asking their supervisor to commend them, saying, ''I just want them to know that their stellar efforts to protect and serve the people are greatly appreciated.''</p>
        <p>But Officer Kelly's three brothers, his brother-in law and a childhood friend, who each spoke briefly about him, seemed to move the mourners the most. James Kelly, a narcotics detective, talked about cleaning out his dead brother's locker at the Staten Island Auto Larceny Unit, where, along with a uniform and shield, he found the mementos his brother had kept. ''He had pictures of you, Trish,'' he said, addressing his brother's wife, ''pictures from the wedding.''</p>
        <p>The friend, Vinny Celano, joked about the playful John Kelly, who once persuaded him to leave work by telling him that his mother had slipped and fallen on the ice and was in the hospital. This, recalled Mr. Celano, was a ruse ''so he could take me to a David Lee Roth concert.'' He also remembered how John Kelly at 17 made him follow a stranger around their neighborhood for more than an hour, convinced that the man was going to break into someone's home. And the would-be cop was right: they watched the man until he committed a crime and then had  John's older brother arrest him.</p>
        <p>But like the others who knew Officer Kelly and tried to share their memories of him, Mr. Celano, too, eventually could not contain his tears. ''Today, I want to tell you how proud I am to be your friend and how proud I am of you,'' he said.</p>
