        <p>THE verdict turned, as many verdicts do, on which lawyer the jury believed. In the history-making class-action suit filed on behalf of some 500,000 Florida smokers against the tobacco industry, the jury believed the lawyer for the plaintiffs, a tall, lanky, balding, rumpled, studious man named Stanley Rosenblatt.</p>
        <p>And what the jury believed about Mr. Rosenblatt, who was prone to flap his arms in agitation like some gigantic bird, was that he was mad.</p>
        <p>Not mad as in insane, but foot-stomping, red-faced, hollering mad, at everybody on the defendants' side of the room in Miami-Dade Circuit Court.</p>
        <p>He was mad at the calm, measured, almost smug tobacco executives, who said that yes, the companies had peddled a dangerous, cancer-causing product but that they now wanted only to be responsible corporate citizens.</p>
        <p>And he was mad at their lawyers, who were asking the jury not to punish the industry for its negligence and fraud because their clients were really good guys now. The tobacco lawyers, in Mr. Rosenblatt's view, played the jury for a bunch of suckers. ''I have a temper,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said, still a little angry a week later. ''And they made me mad.''</p>
        <p>To the jurors, speaking after their decision on July 14 to award the plaintiffs a record $144.8 billion in punitive damages, Mr. Rosenblatt's rants seemed like righteous anger, not just role-playing by one more lawyer.</p>
        <p>''People don't like phonies, and there were a couple of them on the other side,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said in an accent flavored in part by his native Brooklyn and in part by a very specific vernacular that people here call Old Miami Beach, from a time when the town was still largely Jewish and the accents tended to be more Yankee and European.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt, 64, and his wife, Susan Goldman Rosenblatt, 49, who is also a lawyer, took this case six years ago, when others would not touch it, scared away by what had been the industry's relentless success in the nation's courtrooms. The Rosenblatts handled every aspect of the fight themselves, from the research to trial preparation to the actual courtroom battles that at times became so loud that Judge Robert Kaye had to quiet down Mr. Rosenblatt and the tobacco lawyers.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Rosenblatt argued his case, he often did so with a second chair empty. His wife was back at the office, surrounded by a jungle of files, boxes and legal documents, preparing the next day's moves.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was chasing windmills,'' Mrs. Rosenblatt said of how she felt when they first took the case. The opposition was just so strong. On the other side of the courtroom, each of the defendants, the nation's five top cigarette makers, would have a battery of lawyers and staff.</p>
        <p>But it was Big Tobacco that should have worried.</p>
        <p>FOR two years, as the trial dragged on, the cigarette makers sat in a glass house, and Stanley Rosenblatt stood outside the door with a big pile of stones. The 400,000 deaths a year attributed to cigarette smoke for the last 50 years could not be excused away, he said. And as the tobacco lawyers tried to counter him, he just kept flinging stones.</p>
        <p>''The industry has left a half-century trail of deceit, which has decimated millions of Americans,'' he said in his closing argument. ''Never have so few caused so much harm to so many for so long, and the day of reckoning has arrived.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Rosenblatt told the story of death and loss, at least one juror was brought to tears. Later Joel R. Wolpe, a Miami lawyer who has litigated against Mr. Rosenblatt and went to law school at the University of Miami with Mrs. Rosenblatt, would say in an interview: ''Stanley's trying to bring out the truth; the other lawyers were not trying to bring out the truth. All juries want is what we want -- the truth. That's not expecting too much. I think Stanley's very sincere in a courtroom. He's a sincere, honest, honorable man, and I think it comes across.''</p>
        <p>The day after the verdict, the front-page headline in The Miami Herald read, ''No-Name Lawyers Make History.'' That irked Mr. Rosenblatt a little, because although he and his wife were not household names, they were well known in Miami's legal community.</p>
        <p>After all, he has been beating Big Tobacco for a while now. In April he won $12.7 million in compensatory damages from  the same jury. And in 1997 he won $349 million in a class-action lawsuit brought by flight attendants alleging harm from secondhand smoke. He used money from his fees in that case to help finance this one.</p>
        <p>The battle required some sacrifices. The Rosenblatts have nine children, ages 7 to 19, and family time was cut back.</p>
        <p>They live in Miami Beach, in a big house once owned by Anita Bryant, the singer who became better known for anti-gay activism. The house, Mrs. Rosenblatt said, is a disaster. ''Delegating doesn't seem to work,'' she said of the children.</p>
        <p>The one thing the trial did not change was the exercise of their religious beliefs. The Rosenblatts are Orthodox Jews, and never worked on the Sabbath.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt arrived in Miami Beach with his family when he was 10, because a sister had health problems and a doctor had suggested a move from Brooklyn to a warmer climate. His father made a living by selling secondhand restaurant equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt was a gifted student who finished college in two and a half years, majoring in government at the University of Miami, before moving on to law school there. He had started college at the University of Florida in Gainesville but got homesick and came back to finish in Miami. He became a lawyer, he said, because ''I like to be my own boss; I follow my instincts -- the right or wrong is usually very clear to me.''</p>
        <p>Many people once questioned why the Rosenblatts would take this case. One reason, he said, was his discovery that his children's pediatrician, a very intelligent man, was still addicted to cigarettes.</p>
        <p>''That struck me,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said.</p>
        <p>But it was not personal, this battle, at first.</p>
        <p>''I never bought a pack in my life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Then they made him mad.</p>
