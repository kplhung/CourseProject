        <p>In the early 1970's, my feminist friends and I roamed New York with our ''This exploits women'' stickers.

Our actions seem remarkably quaint now, and not just because of our innocence about the ways of the world.</p>

        <p>In the early 1970's, my feminist friends and I roamed New York with our ''This exploits women'' stickers. Whenever we saw egregious examples of female objectification -- in advertisements, on billboards, in store windows -- we'd slap on those signs, naively believing that once our outrage had been expressed, people would see the folly of their behavior and change it, and a more egalitarian society would emerge. Our actions seem remarkably quaint now, and not just because of our innocence about the ways of the world.</p>
        <p>Times have changed, and so have the stickers. These days I'm more likely to see signs on truck and car bumpers that bear a slogan encouraging women to expose their breasts.</p>
        <p>The stickers are the product of the popular ''Opie and Anthony'' show on WNEW-FM New York. During the five-hour show, which runs every weekday afternoon, listeners call to join in supposedly jocular dialogue that frequently takes a disturbing twist, often involving sexual references described in vivid terms. During these conversations, Opie and Anthony encourage callers to get the stickers and display them. The stickers are very easy to get; listeners can send for them, pick them up at certain restaurants, print them off the station's Web site or simply make their own.</p>
        <p>Over the last several years, there has been no dearth of soul-searching and criticism of the ways in which popular culture has coarsened society. Much has been said about the role of movies, television, music, video games and, of course, the Internet. Radio is less often cited as a factor. But shock radio -- particularly shock radio shows like ''Opie and Anthony,'' in which disc jockeys take an in-your-face approach to sexual and scatological banter -- deserves plenty of blame.</p>
        <p>Talk radio at its best speaks to listeners' imaginations and allows them to feel an intimacy with the hosts. But at its worst, it encourages  a form of public wilding, or at least an open fraternity party where everyone can be part of what is advertised as the fun. This is especially true in the new generation of shock radio, which is flourishing throughout the country, all in the name of luring a young, primarily male audience that is coveted by some advertisers. These new shock jocks encourage on-air interaction between callers from the public and the people in the studio.</p>
        <p>Among the callers are women, many of whom go along with the ''fun'' and don't expect that it will ultimately be at their expense. But as in many fraternity parties, things get out of hand, and one bit of repartee may describe a woman as ''hot,'' which may lead to someone in the studio calling her a prostitute or a ''fat cow,'' which may lead to a free-for-all, even chaotic, discussion among callers, shock jocks and other guests on the show. Often the woman caller is relegated to the  background, reduced to tears.</p>
        <p>Even when the hosts make perfunctory protests against the offensive remarks, it's done laughingly, sealing the message that their show is all about fun.</p>
        <p>Clearly, neither Opie and Anthony nor any of their colleague shock-jock hosts have played any direct role in encouraging real-life attacks on women like those in New York's Central Park last June. But by reducing women to collections of body parts, and allowing them to be addressed with sexual epithets, they have helped create an atmosphere where it's acceptable -- even desirable -- to demean women. And the underlying subtext suggests all too obviously that since some women are going along with the routine, it can't be that bad.</p>
