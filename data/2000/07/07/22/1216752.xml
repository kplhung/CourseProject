        <p>Arguing that humans are more important than a few fish, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sharply criticized state and federal environmental officials yesterday for blocking the city from spraying pesticides in wetlands and other marsh areas in its battle against the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The mayor attacked the government policies -- which prohibit spraying many pesticides over water, to protect fish and other aquatic life -- as he announced that spraying to eradicate mosquitoes that carry the virus would be extended to nearly all of Staten Island and northern Queens on Monday night because three more infected birds had been found in those areas.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that danger to human life is more important than birds, fish and insects,'' said Mr. Giuliani. He condemned policies of the National Parks Service, which had prevented spraying pesticides inside the Gateway National Recreation Area, and the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, which has strictly enforced a federal prohibition on the use of pesticides in ponds and wetlands elsewhere in the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's protests, at a news conference on Staten Island, provoked immediate offers of compromise by state and federal officials. The Parks Service said it would allow the city to spray in the Staten Island section of Gateway at the same time it sprays elsewhere in the city on Monday. A senior official of the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington said the agency would consider granting the city an emergency waiver to allow spraying over water, perhaps at the same time on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Our goal and our desire is to make sure we are providing complete health protection,'' said Stephen Johnson, the deputy assistant administrator for the E.P.A.'s office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. He said the waiver would allow the city to spray its pesticide, Anvil, over water despite federal rules that prohibit its use in areas ''where surface water is present.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation, Jennifer Post, said last night that her department would request the waiver ''if that is the route the city wants to take.''</p>
        <p>Despite the apparent concurrence of state and federal officials, the city's plan to spray Anvil over water was greeted with skepticism by environmentalists, who fought fiercely last year against the city's use of  malathion, a more toxic pesticide.</p>
        <p>''The mayor's constant drumbeat about the safety of this product or any of these products could make people cavalier about exposure,'' said Jay Feldman, executive director of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington environmental group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who acknowledged that spraying Anvil over water would kill fish, dismissed environmental protests. ''We catch fish to eat them, so if we lose a few fish to save human lives, I don't understand'' the confusion going on, he said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement of expanded spraying came after health officials concluded that the West Nile virus had killed a blue jay in Douglaston, Queens, and a crow and a sparrow in the Great Kills and Bay Terrace sections of Staten Island during the first week of July. The dead birds are among five identified in the city this year that were infected by the virus, which was responsible for 62 confirmed cases, including seven deaths, last fall.</p>
        <p>The virus is most problematic for children under 5, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. Otherwise, it causes flulike symptoms in healthy adults.</p>
        <p>The city's health commissioner, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, while clearly concerned about the fresh evidence of disease-carrying mosquitoes, said the threat to the city was complicated by the wide swath in which infected birds had been identified -- from the city to the suburbs. He said that posed a threat that the mosquitoes were migrating to unpredictable locations. State health officials said yesterday that 29 birds had been killed by the virus this year, including 5 crows in Rockland County and a blue jay in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>But since there have been no cases of West Nile infection in humans in the city this year, Dr. Cohen said ''there is no reason to reach the conclusion that the virus is more prevalent or has more traction'' than last year.</p>
        <p>Spraying has also begun in Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk Counties, and Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that the findings in Douglaston prompted health officials to ask Nassau County to begin an eradication campaign along its western borders.</p>
        <p>Dr. Katherine Gaffney, the Nassau County health commissioner, said yesterday that she had no intention of ordering pesticide spraying unless infected birds or mosquitoes were found in the county.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to begin adding chemicals to the ecosystem if simple, preventative measures can be used instead,'' she said, adding that the county had tested 189 dead birds and more than 25,000 mosquitoes this year, without finding any West Nile infections.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that the city might also ask Union County in New Jersey to spray because of its proximity to the section of Staten Island where infected birds were identified this week. Tom Plant, a Union County spokesman, said the county had already engaged in extensive testing of chickens and other birds this year and had found no evidence of infection.</p>
        <p>The city's spraying could be completed on Monday night, health officials said, when trucks are deployed in the area around Douglaston and across Staten Island.</p>
        <p>It was unclear yesterday when the city could complete spraying in the Staten Island part of Gateway National Recreation Area, and city health officials said some details of the operation -- including who would pay to spray the park -- remained to be negotiated.</p>
        <p>But they said the agreement of the  Park Service to allow any spraying inside Gateway was welcome, particularly because one of the infected birds identified on Staten Island this week had been found close to the park's boundary.</p>
        <p>''We are pleased that they adopted a position that will allow us to do the maximum we can to protect the health of city residents,'' said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health. ''We will have to work out who bears responsibility, but if the city has to do it, it will.''</p>
