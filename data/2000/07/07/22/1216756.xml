        <p>For even the most seasoned observers of the often-rollicking politics of the Bronx, there is a lot of confusion over a Democratic primary for the State Assembly. At issue is whether a challenger should be allowed to remain on the ballot. And it all began after the challenger said there were threats of violence to get him to withdraw from the race.</p>
        <p>The confusion centers on Joey Jackson, a 33-year-old lawyer who is running for the Assembly in District 83, in the northeastern part of the borough, for a seat being vacated by Samuel D. Bea Jr., who is running for the State Senate.</p>

        <p>For even the most seasoned observers of the often-rollicking politics of the Bronx, there is a lot of confusion over a Democratic primary for the State Assembly. At issue is whether a challenger should be allowed to remain on the ballot. And it all began after the challenger said there were threats of violence to get him to withdraw from the race.</p>
        <p>The confusion centers on Joey Jackson, a 33-year-old lawyer who is running for the Assembly in District 83, in the northeastern part of the borough, for a seat being vacated by Samuel D. Bea Jr., who is running for the State Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said that on July 13, he was approached from behind on a street in the district by two men who told him not to turn around. The men advised Mr. Jackson to drop out of the race and threatened to harm his wife and young child if he did not, Mr. Jackson said.</p>
        <p>''I had to ask myself whether it is worth it to my family to put them through this,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''I had never been faced with a situation like this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said that after thinking about it over the weekend, he decided to leave the race to protect his family. He called the office of the Democratic Party organization in the Bronx on Monday and informed officials of his decision. Mr. Jackson then signed a form making his withdrawal official. He handed the form, known as a certificate of declination, to a lawyer for the party, who promptly filed it with the city's Board of Elections.</p>
        <p>But within two hours, Mr. Jackson had a change of heart. ''I decided I couldn't let something like that stop me from what I wanted to do,'' he said. So Mr. Jackson then went to the Board of Elections office in Manhattan and filed another form to rescind  his withdrawal from the race. That is, perhaps not surprisingly, where the confusion seems to have begun.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath, no one seems to know whether the second document Mr. Jackson filed, rescinding his withdrawal, is valid, and lawyers have been scurrying to find a precedent -- or even language in the state's election laws -- that governs such a revocation.</p>
        <p>Apparently, there is no official form to revoke a withdrawal. In fact, the second document Mr. Jackson filed was the state's declination form, on which he had written ''revocation of certificate of declination.''</p>
        <p>''Certificates of declination are very rare, but not completely unheard of,'' said Steven H. Richman, general counsel for the Board of Elections. ''But in my 10 years of experience in election law, I have never heard of an attempt to cancel a certificate of declination.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richmond said that the 10 commissioners of the Board of Elections would determine whether Mr. Jackson will remain on the ballot. And the Bronx Democratic organization has its own lawyers looking at the matter, with an eye toward possible litigation if Mr. Jackson is allowed to remain on the ballot.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the day after Mr. Jackson filed the forms, he notified the authorities for the first time about the threats against him, contacting the Bronx district attorney's office. He said he did not call the police because he ''didn't want it to be a big political mess.''</p>
        <p>Apart from the legal considerations, there have also been political ones. Mr. Jackson was once a protege of Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman. In fact, Mr. Jackson was chosen by Mr. Ramirez as the chairman of the Bronx Democratic County Committee.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Ramirez put together a slate of candidates for various offices and asked Mr. Jackson to run for the position of district leader.</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Jackson accepted that offer, but changed his mind and decided to run for the Assembly  against Carl E. Heastie, the candidate backed by the party organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heastie contends that Mr. Jackson has been vacillating for weeks about whether to run a campaign, which Mr. Heastie said is against the organization that has promoted his political career. Furthermore, Mr. Heastie said, he finds Mr. Jackson's claims of being threatened less than credible.</p>
        <p>''Joey Jackson approached me last week at a political function and told me that he wanted to talk with me and that he had second thoughts about his race,'' Mr. Heastie said. ''But, at the time, I felt that since we were opponents, there wasn't much to talk about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said that although many of his friends and supporters suspect that the Democratic organization in the Bronx might be tied to the threats to his family, he does not hold the party responsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez said any attempt to link the organization to threats against any candidate was outrageous. Of Mr. Jackson, he said,  ''the more time I spend in politics, the more I am amazed by people's erratic behavior.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Board of Elections will review the situation within a week or so, Mr. Richman said. And both Mr. Heastie and Mr. Jackson said they would continue to campaign for the primary on Sept. 12. Because of the heavily Democratic makeup of the district, winning the primary is tantamount to winning in the general election.</p>
        <p>''I'm campaigning now on a full-time basis,'' said Mr. Heastie, who took a leave of absence from his job as a budget analyst in the office of Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to run for the Assembly. ''Whether Joey is in or out, I've got to do what I've got to do.''</p>
