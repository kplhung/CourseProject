        <p>Over the continued objections of privacy advocates and attorneys general of 39 states, the Federal Trade Commission announced yesterday that it had reached a settlement to permit Toysmart.com, a defunct online toy seller, to sell its customer database as part of its bankruptcy plan.</p>
        <p>But in a 3-to-2 vote cast late on Thursday, the commission also put strict limits on the sale. Under the settlement, a buyer of Toysmart's database must be in a family-related commerce market, buy the entire Web site and agree not to sell the database without getting permission from the individuals included in it.</p>
        <p>The settlement still requires the approval of the court hearing Toysmart's bankruptcy case. The agreement was the result of a civil suit filed by the F.T.C. earlier this month in Federal District Court in Boston seeking to prevent Toysmart from selling the database.</p>
        <p>The commission also amended its original complaint against Toysmart yesterday, adding a second accusation that the company had collected personal information from children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Act of 1998. It was the first time the government filed a complaint under the act since it went into effect in April. Just as it announced the second complaint, the commission said it had reached a settlement in which Toysmart agreed to destroy about 2,000 records that might have been in violation of the law, said Harry Murphy, a lawyer for Toysmart. The law prohibits sites from collecting data from children younger than 13 without parental consent.</p>
        <p>The maneuvering yesterday highlighted how important the case had become to privacy advocates, legislators and Internet industry observers. With Internet companies able to easily build massive databases on their visitors, various political and policy groups have expressed concern about how to balance the benefits to companies and consumers of collecting the information, which can be used to create target advertising, with privacy issues.</p>
        <p>While the company, which is majority owned by the Walt Disney Company, posted an explicit policy stating it would not sell customer information to a third party, it later went bankrupt and sought to sell the database along with its other assets, raising the specter that other dot-com companies that fail would hawk their databases, too.</p>
        <p>''We're definitely sending a message that just because a company fails, we're going to continue to pursue action,'' said Eric London, a trade commission spokesman. ''If there's a bankruptcy tidal wave, this is going to happen a lot,'' he added.</p>
        <p>This is the second time the commission has filed a complaint pertaining to the release of database information from an online company; in August of 1998, the F.T.C. settled with GeoCities, which the government said made information available to third parties without disclosing the activity to its users. But the Toysmart case is the first time the F.T.C. has brought such an action in a bankruptcy setting. In the case of Toysmart, the database amounted to information collected on about 250,000 individuals, Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Murphy declined to speculate on the value of the database, but he said that earlier this year he represented a client that liquidated a far larger database for $210,000, suggesting the Toysmart data might not be so lucrative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said that the company has received two, possibly three, bids for the database, including one from  Disney, which held three of the company's five board seats. Disney said after the commission had sued Toysmart that it would buy the database and ''retire'' it. Mr. Murphy said a second bid was from Digital Research of Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen, however, whether any sale of the database will go through. A bankruptcy court in Boston is scheduled to hear the case on Wednesday and will hear objections to the sale that were filed before the settlement was reached by at least two groups -- an online privacy organization and the attorneys general from 39 states.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the attorney general of Massachusetts filed an objection on behalf of his state and the others  in the bankruptcy court, asserting that the sale of the database constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice. Pamela Kogut, an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts handling the case, said Toysmart should be forced to live up to its promise to never sell the data to a third party. ''Outside the context of this bankruptcy filing, Toysmart should be prohibited from selling this customer list,'' she said, noting the bankruptcy should not free Toysmart from its promise.</p>
        <p>She said the attorneys general were studying the F.T.C. settlement but would not comment on it until after the bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the court will also hear an objection from Truste, a nonprofit agency that certifies the privacy policy of online retailers. Toysmart was among about 2,000 sites that had received Truste's seal of approval, and it was the organization that brought Toysmart's effort to sell its database to the F.T.C.'s attention.</p>
        <p>David Steer, a spokesman for Truste, said he had not studied the F.T.C. settlement thoroughly but that it did appear to leave too much room for the sale of the database in a way that would violate the promise made to Toysmart visitors. ''We're going to go ahead with our own suit,'' he said, referring to the objection filed by Truste on Friday in bankruptcy court. ''We applaud the F.T.C. for getting halfway there.''</p>
