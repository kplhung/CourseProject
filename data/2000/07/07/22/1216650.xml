      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Pilobolus Dance Theater found the perfect name for its two-person touring company. Pilobolus Too, which performed on Wednesday afternoon at the Joyce Theater, is not the traditional junior or second dance company but rather a jewel-like distillation of the best of the Pilobolus spirit and history.</p>
        <p>In part the credit should go to the two dancers, former members of the parent company. Adam Battelstein is a gifted physical actor whose nuanced performing often suggests gallant misfits who are simultaneously funny and ill at ease in a world full of oddities and dangers. Rebecca Stenn is his larger-than-life, slyly Wagnerian complement, a rubber-bodied take-charge creature who calmly negotiates all obstacles.</p>

        <p>Pilobolus Dance Theater found the perfect name for its two-person touring company. Pilobolus Too, which performed on Wednesday afternoon at the Joyce Theater, is not the traditional junior or second dance company but rather a jewel-like distillation of the best of the Pilobolus spirit and history.</p>
        <p>In part the credit should go to the two dancers, former members of the parent company. Adam Battelstein is a gifted physical actor whose nuanced performing often suggests gallant misfits who are simultaneously funny and ill at ease in a world full of oddities and dangers. Rebecca Stenn is his larger-than-life, slyly Wagnerian complement, a rubber-bodied take-charge creature who calmly negotiates all obstacles.</p>
        <p>The seven short pieces and excerpts from the Pilobolus repertory that they performed were very well chosen. The program not only included a good selection of golden Pilobolus oldies but it also appealed to the entire family, to judge by adult oohs and aahs and giggles and shrieks from the many children in the audience.</p>
        <p>A solo and a duet from ''Land's Edge'' perfectly captured the mysterious, slightly creepy nature of the 1986 narrative piece. Mr. Battelstein and Ms. Stenn made every subtle strain of fantasy clear in the 1998 ''Orangotango,'' a duet for a man in an ape mask and a sexy woman who may prefer apes as dancing partners. The 1999 ''Femme Noire'' gave Ms. Stenn an extraordinary prop -- a huge lacy black picture hat -- to play seductively with.</p>
        <p>The abstract side of Pilobolus was represented by ''Alraune'' and the long-seeming ''Shizen.'' Best of all was the solo from ''Empty Suitor,'' a dance for a man, his top hat and the wooden bench and rolling tubes that make his life a misery. Here and throughout the program the stage crew was used brilliantly to amplify and link the pieces.</p>
