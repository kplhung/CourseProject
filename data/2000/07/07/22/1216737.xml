        <p>The Yankees made a trade with the Chicago Cubs last night for a right-handed-hitting outfielder with some pop in his bat. But it did not involve Sammy Sosa and it did not mean they were through trading.</p>
        <p>Glenallen Hill, who is 35 years old and in his 12th major league season, was obtained for two minor leaguers. He will be used primarily as a pinch-hitter and a designated hitter, replacing, if not upgrading, the bat of Jim Leyritz, whom the Yankees traded to the Dodgers earlier this month for infielder Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>In exchange for Hill, the Yankees sent the Cubs two relief pitchers: the right-hander Ben Ford, who has been at Class AAA Columbus after struggling with his control in four appearances with the Yankees this year, and the Class AA left-hander Ozwaldo Mairena.</p>
        <p>Though they made another dip into their farm system, the Yankees hardly gave up much to acquire Hill, whom they would have pursued even if left fielder Shane Spencer had not suffered a season-ending knee injury two weeks ago. Infielder Alfonso Soriano, their blue-chip minor leaguer, is still available if another deal is brewing.</p>
        <p>And one might be. The Yankees said they would continue discussions for a permanent left fielder to replace Spencer, focusing attention on Montreal Expos outfielder Rondell White.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we still have areas we need to address; this doesn't stop us from having discussions with anybody else,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said last night before the Yankees' 11-1 victory over Tampa Bay at Yankee Stadium. ''I'm not done lining up choices for George Steinbrenner to say 'yeah' or 'nay' to.''</p>
        <p>Hill was expected to report today or tomorrow, but Cashman was not sure who would be dropped or put on the disabled list to open the roster spot.</p>
        <p>Hill, who is with his sixth team, brings to the Yankees home run power, but he has lagged in that area this season. He is batting .229 in 166 at-bats with 10 home runs and 28 runs batted in. Last year Hill batted .253 with 20 home runs and 55 R.B.I. He has 164 home runs in his career, 11 as a pinch-hitter.</p>
        <p>''Hill is replacing what Leyritz was supposed to supply,'' Cashman said. ''Glenallen has got some serious power. He'll be a threat at the plate every time up there. We're hoping we'll get more success out of Glenallen than when Jimmy was here.''</p>
        <p>Cashman said he did not have discussions with the Cubs for Hill when he was talking about Sosa with Ed Lynch, who was the Cubs' general manager until this week. Cashman said he started talking with Lynch about Hill a few days before Lynch resigned. Andy McPhail, the Cubs' president, took over the trade talks.</p>
        <p>If Hill were to play left field, it would be on a limited basis. David Justice, acquired in a trade from the Cleveland Indians this month, started in left field last night, but he is not the permanent solution, both Cashman and Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>''He was more of a perfect fit when we had Shane Spencer,'' Cashman said. ''Our preference is that David be the D.H. and be an insurance policy.''</p>
        <p>Torre does not feel secure with his left fielders in what has been a series of failed auditions from a rotating cast call, from Ryan Thompson to Felix Jose.</p>
        <p>''I really don't have a lot of patience with that,'' Torre said. ''Ideally, you want to give somebody a week to earn the spot. Right now I would rather put my experience out there.''</p>
        <p>While Justice could play left field three to four times a week, the chances of finding a regular starter from the other available choices ''is like catching lightning in a bottle,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>As for making a trade imminently for a left fielder, Torre said, ''There's no question we're looking to fill it.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte Goes To Boy's Aid</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte sprinted from right field just as Yankees batting practice was ending. He saw that the fans in the stands were more interested in screaming for autographs than in attending to the fallen child around them.</p>
        <p>Pettitte saw the ball fly out of a batting cage and strike 12-year-old Rashad Harris in the left eye. Pettitte ran to the seats behind the tarpaulin in right field and scooped the boy -- a regular at batting practice who was without parents or guardians yesterday -- and flopped him onto his back.</p>
        <p>With a trail of concerned teammates behind him, Pettitte rushed Rashad into the Yankees' clubhouse. Ten minutes later, the boy was wheeled out of the Yankees' training room on a stretcher. He was conscious, having responded to the questions of team doctors, but he had a swollen eye and was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.</p>
