        <p>China announced a large reorganization of domestic airlines today, merging seven carriers into the three largest to reduce the overlap of routes and the number of half-empty planes that have plagued the industry for years.</p>
        <p>Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines will absorb the other carriers, giving each of the three surviving airlines roughly $6 billion in assets, China's state news agency, Xinhua, reported. It gave no timetable for the mergers or which airline would merge with which.</p>
        <p>China's airline industry has had a turbulent ride since the country broke the Civil Aviation Administration of China's state airline monopoly into six regional carriers in the late 1980's and later allowed provincial governments to start their own airlines. The idea was to better serve the explosion in passengers that came with relaxed controls on air travel by Chinese citizens and a subsequent economic boom.</p>
        <p>The expansion led to a series of crashes that made China the most dangerous place to fly in the early 1990's. China rectified that with increased training for pilots and a moratorium on aircraft purchases. But a second wave of expansion left the industry with too many airline seats for the number of passengers it was serving as the growth of air travel tapered off in the 1997-98 Asian economic crisis.</p>
        <p>China's airline industry, which includes 34 airlines, lost more than $72 million in 1998 as companies cut ticket prices in a scramble for passengers. China fixed prices and banned discounts in 1999 to try to stop the bleeding. It delayed delivery of aircraft that had been ordered. It cut air routes. It even demanded all airlines pool 80 percent of their ticket revenue on specific routes and divide it among the carriers servicing that route. The industry edged back to profitability last year, but none of that solved the problem.</p>
        <p>The country is loath to allow the market to solve the problem by letting money-losing airlines go bankrupt, a solution considered too brutal in China's socialist economy.</p>
        <p>The airlines involved employ about 73,000 people and carry heavy debts. It is not clear how much of those burdens the three surviving airlines will be forced to assume.</p>
        <p>The seven airlines are China Southwest, China Northwest, China Northern, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Great Wall and Zhejiang,</p>
        <p>The consolidation would in theory create economies of scale and give the industry the potential to develop hub-and-spoke networks similar to those of airlines in the United States. China Southern is based in the southern city of Guangzhou, China Eastern in the eastern commercial hub of Shanghai and Air China in the northern capital of Beijing.</p>
        <p>And it could prepare the industry for increased competition once China enters the World Trade Organization, expected later this year.</p>
        <p>Foreigners are also expected to be allowed up to 49 percent stakes in China's airlines, up from the 35 percent limit now.</p>
