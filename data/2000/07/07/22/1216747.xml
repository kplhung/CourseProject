        <p>Fending off another attack on his voting record, Representative Rick A. Lazio today defended his vote to approve a bill that gave members of Congress a  raise and said Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign was resorting to ''cynical'' tactics.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, the Clinton campaign and the New York State Democratic Party lambasted Mr. Lazio for throwing his support on Thursday behind an appropriations bill that included a $4,000 pay raise, also called a cost-of-living increase, for members of the House of Representatives, because Mr. Lazio, a Long Island congressman, campaigned against pay raises when he first ran for office in 1992.</p>
        <p>During a sweep through western New York for his Senate campaign that ended in this rural village 50 miles east of Buffalo, Mr. Lazio said several times that he was opposed to pay raises. But he said he had voted Thursday in support of a budget bill that included the raise and several other measures after an attempt to remove the increase from the bill  failed.</p>
        <p>''I have generally opposed the-cost of-living increases for House members,'' Mr. Lazio said, adding, ''I don't recall that I've ever voted for one, to the best of my recollection. And that's consistent with my past  record.''</p>
        <p>But Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, and Judith Hope, chairwoman of the State Democratic Party, cited news reports that Mr. Lazio voted for a pay raise in 1997.  Dan McLagan, a Lazio spokesman,  said the campaign was not aware of his supporting a pay increase in 1997, and said he had consistently opposed pay increases.</p>
        <p>''This is just more double talk from Rick Lazio,'' said Mr. Wolfson.  ''He ran for Congress against perks, privileges and pay raises but once he got there he voted twice for pay raises in the dead of night.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''It's the worst kind of dog-ate-my-homework excuse I've ever heard. Why doesn't he just come clean with New Yorkers and admit that he voted for a pay raise?''</p>
        <p>The issue of raises for members of Congress has been such a traditionally hot topic in campaigns that Congress several years ago changed the rules to mute it. Under current rules, unless Congress votes to block a pay raise, members are automatically given a certain percentage increase in the general Treasury budget, which is voted on as a part of a huge appropriation bill that includes financing for much of the government, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service and other divisions. There is no specific language in the appropriations bill for the Treasury that gives Congress the pay raise; it is drawn from those general revenues.</p>
        <p>In this week's votes, the first vote involved a procedural motion that could have opened a way for opponents of the increase to block it. But that motion was defeated, 250-173, with Mr. Lazio among those voting to block it. That vote effectively halted efforts to defeat the pay raise.</p>
        <p>The two subsequent votes pertained specifically to the Treasury appropriations bill, and on those Mr. Lazio voted yes each time, and the appropriation was approved.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign then criticized Mrs. Clinton, saying she did not understand the legislative process if she believed that Mr. Lazio should have voted against the Treasury bill, which included financing for things like child care for federal employees. And it noted that President Clinton has signed several pay raises for federal employees into law.</p>
        <p>Today was the second day in a row that Mr. Lazio's voting record was the subject of sharp exchanges between the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton lashed out at Mr. Lazio for trying to kill and then scaling back a program to help first-time home buyers secure mortgages in 1998.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Lazio suggested several times during stops in Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Albion that the Clinton campaign appeared to be desperate for dirt on him.</p>
        <p>During a morning radio program on WLVO-AM in Buffalo, Mr. Lazio said, ''I understand what the opposition is trying to do. They've made a decision. They can't win this race by staying positive or being honest.''</p>
        <p>Later, at Kafana's Coffee Shop in Albion, he told a small crowd, ''This campaign will be about taking the high road. I'm not going to sink down. We're not going there.''</p>
