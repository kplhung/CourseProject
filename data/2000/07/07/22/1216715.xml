        <p>Anyone who relishes scary stories knows that there is one sure way to slay a vampire: drive a sharp wooden stake through his heart while he sleeps.</p>
        <p>A 45-year-old Rockland County man, David W. Bolton, tried to do just that to a neighbor early Wednesday, the police said. ''We've had our share of violent attacks,'' said Sgt. Steve Morgan of the Clarkstown police, ''but nothing with this, shall we say, modus operandi.''</p>
        <p>According to police reports, about 2 a.m. Mr. Bolton broke into his victim's room at the Laurel Hotel, a boardinghouse where both men live in Nanuet. He was carrying a hammer and a handmade wooden cross that had been whittled to a spike at one end, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolton struck the other man, Jeffrey Todd, 22, with the hammer, and brandished the sharpened cross as if he were about to impale him, the police said. Mr. Todd awoke in time to wrestle the cross from Mr. Bolton,  but Mr. Bolton repeatedly hit him with the hammer on the head, neck, shoulder and back, the police said. When others in the boardinghouse heard the commotion and came to help, Mr. Bolton ran back to his room, where he was later arrested, the police said. Mr. Todd, a construction worker, was treated at Nyack Hospital and released.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Morgan said the two men had had no previous dispute. Mr. Bolton told police officers that he had ''received instructions from a higher authority,'' the sergeant said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolton was being held without bail today at the Rockland County Correctional Facility, charged with attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal possession of a weapon, the police said.</p>
        <p>Back at the Laurel Hotel, Mr. Todd's older brother Brian said the attack had left him and other residents too frightened to sleep. ''It freaks you out,'' he said. ''I can't sleep at night. No one can. You see it happening in the movies, but you never expect it in real life.''</p>
