        <p>Lloyd Tysuir was trying, without much success, not to shake. He had tightly pursed his lips and pressed his forearms against his knees. His head was bent low, eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
        <p>Two Immigration and Naturalization Service officers, in white short-sleeved shirts and blue pants, stood over Mr. Tysuir, their detainee from Kingston, Jamaica, at Kennedy International Airport. And nearby, Dr. Robert M. Trager, the man with the unusual title of airport dentist, pulled on his surgical gloves with a snap.</p>
        <p>''Relax,'' he said. ''This isn't going to hurt.''</p>
        <p>Much, though, was at stake for the young man on this afternoon as he at last opened his mouth inside Dr. Trager's tiny dental office, just down the hall from the American Indian gift shop in the airport's Terminal 4.</p>
        <p>Dental and bone X-rays, in the view of the I.N.S., are one of the most reliable ways of determining age. The eruption of wisdom teeth, and the fusion of bones in the wrist, usually signify that a person is over 18, Dr. Trager said. And an immigrant's age can be critical to his or her effort to gain entry to, and residence in, the United States.</p>
        <p>So, hundreds of Chinese, Somalis, Sri Lankans, Albanians, Hondurans and others who claim on travel documents to be under 18 have filed through Dr. Trager's office in recent years. He takes X-rays of their teeth, and often of their wrists as well.</p>
        <p>They get a look out the office's small window onto the airport tarmac. For most, it is all they see of the United States.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trager, who also has a private practice in Queens, works under contract to the I.N.S. In his airport office, he also sees a regular roster of airport employees and businessmen who need fillings and the like. ''I was in the right place at the right time,'' he said of his work for the I.N.S., which began in 1997. ''My office is right above Customs and Immigration. Lawyers for the detainees have tried to challenge my diagnosis and method, but these challenges have all been dismissed in federal court.''</p>
        <p>At the airport, I.N.S. agents single out illegal immigrants who appear to be older than their paperwork indicates, and take them to see Dr. Trager. Minors who enter the United States, unlike adults, are exempt from immediate deportation. They are automatically released to any family members living in the country.</p>
        <p>The I.N.S. will allow minors to remain in the United States if they are granted political asylum or ''special immigrant juvenile status,'' given when a child is the victim of abuse or neglect. Most cases take at least six months to resolve. If denied asylum, they cannot be sent home until relatives in their home country are contacted.</p>
        <p>Juvenile immigrants who have no relatives in the United States can be detained. But during any period of detention, they are housed separately from adults for their safety.</p>
        <p>For the immigrants, then, the stakes are high.</p>
        <p>''We use this method because it is a widely accepted process within forensic medicine to accurately, within a given range, determine an individual's age,'' said Russell Bergeron, a spokesman for the I.N.S. ''This is important to us because we need to determine age in order to ensure juveniles are handled as juveniles and adults do not use false statements with respect to their age to avoid treatment as adults.''</p>
        <p>But some specialists view the dental and wrist X-rays as far from foolproof. Dr. Herbert H. Frommer, the director of radiology at New York University College of Dentistry, is one.</p>
        <p>''It is impossible to make an exact judgment based on radiographs of whether an individual is above or below the age of 18,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Human rights advocates cite the case of a teenager from Liberia, Mekabou Fofana, who arrived at Kennedy Airport in July 1999 and had a dental and bone exam. Based on the X-rays, he was determined to be over 18, and was therefore ordered held at a detention center in Queens. His family members, including an uncle who is a United States citizen, continue to insist that he was born on July 20, 1983, and that he should be treated as a minor.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned about the accuracy of this practice,'' said Eleanor Acer, a staff attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which is handling Mr. Fofana's case. ''We have found teenage children, inaccurately determined by the I.N.S. to be adults, detained in adult facilities.''</p>
        <p>Advocates also criticize the I.N.S.'s decision not to allow those determined to be adults to appeal the decision.</p>
        <p>''There should be some objective scrutiny of this decision by someone like an immigration judge,'' said Wendy Young, the director of government relations at the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. ''One of the problems we encounter is that there is an incentive by the I.N.S. to detain children with adults, because it is cheaper.  When you have one dentist contracted to the I.N.S. making these calls, it raises red flags.''</p>
        <p>In the dentist's office last week, Lloyd Tysuir was so nervous that he could barely make it to the beige vinyl dental chair. He started moaning: ''They are going to lock me up and put me in jail. They are going to lock me up and put me in jail.''</p>
        <p>''I'm only 15,'' he implored.</p>
        <p>''Calm down, Louie,'' Dr. Trager said, mispronouncing the young man's name. ''You are going to be all right, brother. Just relax.''</p>
        <p>When the dentist finished taking pictures of Mr. Tysuir's mouth, he took two X-rays of his wrist, tossing the first aside because his patient was shaking too much.</p>
        <p>Then, with a smile, he waved goodbye to his patient and the two uniformed escorts and shut the door to his tiny dark room, built in what was once a closet, with a bang.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trager, 60, who also has a small dental office at La Guardia Airport, has examined well over a thousand undocumented immigrants and those with questionable documents, and nearly all, after his 20-minute procedure, have been determined to be older than 18.</p>
        <p>While the exams are routine, designed to detect the wisdom teeth and determine whether the wrist bones are fused, many of the immigrants take one look at the dental drill, the stocky doctor and the rows of medicine bottles and collapse in fear.</p>
        <p>Last January, a Polish applicant fell to his knees, clasped his hands and began praying loudly. He wet his pants before the I.N.S. guards could coax him into the chair. He turned out to be 16.</p>
        <p>''He looked at me as if I was Dr. Mengele,'' Dr. Trager said.</p>
        <p>The dentist's business -- he hands out fliers advertising his business as the Smiles High Club -- got a huge boost in April 1997, when the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act went into effect. Immigration officials began bringing him about 600 people a year. He declined to reveal how much the agency pays him.</p>
        <p>Under the new law, immigrants were no longer released and told to appear at hearings. Instead, undocumented immigrants seeking asylum were detained if their status was in doubt or immediately deported.</p>
        <p>The I.N.S. has not housed minors and adults in the same facility since the rape several years ago of an underage girl in a detention center. The I.N.S. took 4,607 minors into custody last year.</p>
        <p>Dr. Trager said he believed that he was the only dentist who did both the medical and dental exams for the I.N.S. In Miami, a dentist under contract to the I.N.S. examines teeth, and an orthopedist takes X-rays of the wrist. Dr. Trager acknowledged that he was not trained in orthopedics, but insisted that he had enough medical background to interpret the X-ray results correctly.</p>
        <p>''I look at the molars first,'' the dentist said, referring to the wisdom teeth. ''When all four molars have erupted in a Caucasian male, this means the patient is between 18 and 21. In black males the person is between 17 and 21. In females the molars erupt about six months later.''</p>
        <p>When the dental X-rays are inconclusive, he turns to a large book with a blue cover he calls ''my bible.'' It is a 1959 edition of the Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Hand and Wrist, by William Walter Greulich and S. Idell Pyle. He keeps a second volume in the trunk of his car.</p>
        <p>The dentist matches the X-rays of the wrists of his patients with the photos in the book. Female wrist bones are fused at the age of 17. Male wrist bones fuse at 18. The fused bone, with the fully erupted wisdom teeth, allow him to determine whether a patient is under or over 18, he said, to within three months.</p>
        <p>Last week, when he finished taking the X-rays of Lloyd Tysuir, Dr. Trager had the film developed and filled out an I.N.S. form. Mr. Tysuir, he wrote, was about 20. One of the I.N.S. officers glanced at the form.  ''It's just as well,'' said the guard.  ''He'll get shipped home quicker.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Tysuir departed, he turned to the dentist.</p>
        <p>''I'm not over 18, am I?'' he asked. ''I'm 15.''</p>
        <p>The dentist was unmoved.</p>
        <p>''He knows he is lying,'' Dr. Trager said as the young man was being taken away to an I.N.S. detention center. ''He was putting on an act. I would say at least 90 percent don't tell the truth. It is part of the game. This charade is over.''</p>
