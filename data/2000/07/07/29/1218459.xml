        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Louis Winnick (Op-Ed, July 22) mourns the passing of cooperative housing that flourished in New York City from the 1920's to the 60's. In 1928, when I was 5, my family and I moved into the Amalgamated Houses in the Bronx, and I lived there until I married.</p>
        <p>There is no need to regret. A generation of immigrants' children grew up in an environment that enriched their lives. It helped them move into the heart of American life as significant contributors and, for some, as shining lights.</p>

        <p>Louis Winnick (Op-Ed, July 22) mourns the passing of cooperative housing that flourished in New York City from the 1920's to the 60's. In 1928, when I was 5, my family and I moved into the Amalgamated Houses in the Bronx, and I lived there until I married.</p>
        <p>There is no need to regret. A generation of immigrants' children grew up in an environment that enriched their lives. It helped them move into the heart of American life as significant contributors and, for some, as shining lights.</p>
        <p>Whether or not the same circumstances prevail today is open to question. Irving Howe once described the passing of socialist ideas as simply a prelude to new ways of ameliorating social ills. It is heartening to realize that in its time and place cooperative housing proved to be a great success, and hopeful to believe that new ways for progress will appear in the future.</p>
