        <p>Plans to build a $500 million shopping mall here cleared an important hurdle today when the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development announced a finding that the mall would not harm the environment  or cause unmanageable traffic problems in the Long Wharf area.</p>
        <p>The decision, which was sharply criticized by opponents of the mall plans, including an association of downtown New Haven merchants, allows the state's development authority to authorize $28 million in state tax subsidies for the mall's developer, the New England Development Corporation. Construction is scheduled to begin next year.</p>
        <p>The mall is expected to add 3,000 jobs to New Haven's limping economy and $7 million in annual property taxes, said the city's mayor, John DeStefano, who said he was gratified by today's announcement. He maintained a cautious optimism toward the mall's prospects. ''Nothing is a slam dunk,'' he said, but ''I would say we're coming down the other side of the mountain.''</p>
        <p>Westfield America, which owns a mall in nearby Milford, has vigorously fought plans for the mall, called the Galleria at Long Wharf. Ronald Cohen, a lawyer for Westfield, called today's decision ''irrational'' and said the company would sue to have it reversed.</p>
        <p>The company has already filed 15 lawsuits to block the mall, Mayor DeStefano said.</p>
        <p>Marc S. Ryan, the state budget director, who made today's announcement, defended the state's ruling that the mall would not pose environmental or traffic problems. ''This project underwent more scrutiny than any other economic development project of the last decade,'' he said.</p>
