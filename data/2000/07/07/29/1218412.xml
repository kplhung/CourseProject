        <p>The Nortel Networks Corporation of Canada continued its push to become a major developer of Internet systems yesterday as it announced that it had agreed to acquire Alteon WebSystems Inc. for $7.8 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., makes equipment that allows Internet servers -- the computers that hold information on the Web -- to perform more efficiently.

        <p>The Nortel Networks Corporation of Canada continued its push to become a major developer of Internet systems yesterday as it announced that it had agreed to acquire Alteon WebSystems Inc. for $7.8 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>Alteon, based in San Jose, Calif., makes equipment that allows Internet servers -- the computers that hold information on the Web -- to perform more efficiently. Alteon's gear splits up requests for Internet information among a company's individual servers, allowing the servers to perform at their best, and can spare those servers the electronic burden of performing routine tasks like encryption.</p>
        <p>As big communications carriers try to offer a full package of Internet services, equipment like Alteon's can allow them to maximize the value of the Web servers they already have and to offer more finely tailored services to their corporate customers.</p>
        <p>The value of such a product is reflected in the move by Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of Internet equipment, to acquire Alteon's main competitor, ArrowPoint Communications, based in Acton, Mass., for $5.7 billion in May. At the time, that deal was seen by some communications analysts as a negative for Alteon. With Cisco's acquisition of ArrowPoint, the argument went, it would be tougher for Alteon to sell itself.</p>
        <p>Clearly, it was not that tough. North America's Big Three makers of communications equipment, Cisco, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel, are engaged in a furious battle to dominate the market for the next generation of communications technology, and the sort of gear Alteon makes fits that bill perfectly.</p>
        <p>For the next few years, there will probably be three major ''sweet spots'' in the communications equipment business. One is in the sale to communications carriers of wireless systems that can transport Internet data. Another is in the sale to communications carriers of optical systems that can transmit billions of bits of information in ways that are both flexible and robust. (Earlier this week Nortel ended discussions to combine its optical components unit with that of Corning Inc.) And the third is in the sale to carriers of advanced data networking equipment.</p>
        <p>Alteon fits into the third category, one that Cisco, Lucent and Nortel are approaching from different directions.</p>
        <p>Cisco's roots are in the sale of data communications equipment to corporate customers for office networks. Now that the corporate market is largely mature, Cisco is furiously trying to reinvent itself as a vendor to big international communications carriers, whose technical requirements are far more complex and stringent than those of everyday corporations. In Cisco's favor, however, is its legacy of experience with data communications systems.</p>
        <p>Lucent and Nortel have the opposite problem. For decades, those two companies have been meeting the requirements of the world's biggest carriers, but mostly by providing systems for voice telephone calls. Only over the last few years have Lucent and Nortel made significant strides in data networking.</p>
        <p>A company like Alteon can jump-start that effort, not least because it already has significant customers and partners, including Akamai Technologies Inc., which helps transmit electronic ''content'' on the Web. Unlike many of the start-up optical communications companies that are being snapped up these days for billions of dollars, Alteon has revenue, $110 million in its most recent fiscal year, which ended in June.</p>
        <p>''In the new economy, the value and richness of content across the Internet is increasing on a massive scale,'' Clarence Chandran, Nortel's chief operating officer and heir apparent to John A. Roth, Nortel's chief executive, said in a statement. ''Our acquisition of Alteon WebSystems will accelerate the delivery of an Internet data center capable of moving content seamlessly and rapidly.''</p>
        <p>Dominic Orr, Alteon's chief executive, said in a statement, ''Alteon WebSystems and Nortel Networks share a common vision of high-performance content delivery services that exploit the high-performance Internet and create new profit opportunities for service providers.''</p>
        <p>The Alteon deal is Nortel's biggest acquisition since it agreed to acquire Bay Networks Inc. for $9.1 billion in 1998. Under yesterday's agreement, Alteon stockholders are to receive 1.83148 shares of Nortel for each of their Alteon shares. Based on Nortel's closing price Thursday of $78.625, the deal is worth $144 for each Alteon share, $1 more than Alteon's closing price Thursday.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, shares of Nortel fell $5.125, to $73, amid a broad stock market sell-off. Shares of Alteon closed at $129, down $14.</p>
