        <p>Brooklyn's ragged waterfront has long taunted civic leaders, developers and ordinary dreamers with the possibility of a shoreline park with stunning views of Manhattan and the New York harbor.

        <p>Brooklyn's ragged waterfront has long taunted civic leaders, developers and ordinary dreamers with the possibility of a shoreline park with stunning views of Manhattan and the New York harbor. Now, for the first time in decades, a reasonable plan has managed to win the support of various neighborhood and political groups. The proposal for a 70-acre strip of parkland and commercial space called Brooklyn Bridge Park has also won approval and a big piece of the funding from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.</p>
        <p>The next important step is for Gov. George Pataki, who likes the general idea of a shoreline park, to come stand on a lonely quay, imagine green walkways instead of Port Authority eyesores and give the project his weighty stamp of approval.</p>
        <p>Brooklyn park enthusiasts have seen more than a few disappointments over the years, with one plan dying of political intrigue and another expiring under the weight of public outcry about an overbearing waterfront hotel. The development of this latest plan, financed with seed money from the state, included so much public participation that the vast majority of community groups support it enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>There are a few opponents with rather narrow concerns, like residents of one street who want to erect an iron gate barring any pedestrians trying to walk to the park through their neighborhood. But there are also more legitimate worries that this park, which includes a hotel and other commercial ventures, creates a burdensome new requirement that future urban parks must be sustained by private or commercial support. In addition, Brooklyn's developers still need to work with the city and state to create a reasonable administrative structure to manage this shoreline park with both public and commercial areas.</p>
        <p>This is not an impossible task, given the successful creation of a management structure for the bigger and more ambitious Hudson River Park. But at this stage the governor needs to publicly commit the staff, energy and funds necessary to convert 1.3 miles of rusted shoreline into an open waterfront promenade that he and Mayor Giuliani can claim as a durable part of their legacy.</p>
