        <p>THE criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the family of Amadou Diallo and others who were distraught when a jury acquitted four New York City police officers in the infamous case of the 41 bullets.</p>
        <p>The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask ardent defenders of Charles Schwarz, the former police officer doing prison time for his role in the brutal assault on Abner Louima.</p>
        <p>The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the millions who cannot believe that O. J. Simpson was found not guilty at his murder trial.</p>
        <p>The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the many who are still shaking their heads because Bernard Goetz, the subway shooter, was absolved of the most serious felony charges against him.</p>
        <p>The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the family and friends of Patrick M. Dorismond, shot to death by an undercover narcotics detective during a curb-side brawl in March. They are the latest who will tell you that justice is an illusion now that a Manhattan grand jury has decided against indicting the detective, Anthony Vasquez.</p>
        <p>It seems to be a popular pastime: trashing the system when it does not produce the results you want. Even City Hall cannot resist playing this game. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has cited the Diallo and Dorismond outcomes as proof that the wheels of justice turn smoothly, has been more than willing to denounce the New York judiciary as jerky, ideological and (gasp!) Democratic when it does not rule to his liking.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the attackers are unencumbered by certain details, like evidence. In the Dorismond case, some critics talked immediately about the system's having failed even though they, unlike the grand jurors, had no access to the witnesses and exhibits, no way to evaluate the credibility of the police face to face.</p>
        <p>''People who want indictments simply want indictments,'' said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. ''They don't care about the evidence. They say, 'We want indictments because we're angry.' That's not the way the criminal justice system works.''</p>
        <p>And yet, while they may accept the grand jury's conclusion that Detective Vasquez committed no crime, many New Yorkers will find it hard to shake the feeling that this case has not turned out right.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the unarmed Mr. Dorismond contributed to his own death, as the jurors suggested, by letting his short fuse blow when undercover officers approached him looking to buy crack cocaine. But he is still the one who is dead -- dead, as his mother said on Thursday, for saying no to drugs. No way will that sit right with many people.</p>
        <p>The public has a built-in alarm system that enables it -- most of the time, anyway -- to separate good from bad when police behavior comes under fire.</p>
        <p>That helps explain why there was no outcry a few weeks ago when two off-duty police officers killed an unarmed man who bizarrely began punching them on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens. And it is why, by contrast, the Diallo case continues to cast long shadows even though the officers who killed the unarmed Mr. Diallo were cleared of murder charges.</p>
        <p>MR. DORISMOND'S death seems likely to keep on reverberating, too.</p>
        <p>Fairly or not, problem cases like this one have caused many New Yorkers to sour on their machinery of criminal justice, Mr. Meyers said. With all respect to District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, he said, some will wonder how aggressive any district attorney can be in police-misconduct cases, given how he has to work closely with the police every day. Mr. Meyers's solution is not the reflexive call for federal intervention now being heard, but rather the appointment of a special state prosecutor to handle such cases.</p>
        <p>Others have their own issues. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and candidate for mayor, was among those who said that the performance of Detective Vasquez and company showed the need for better police training and supervision.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer and others are also not about to let the mayor off the hook for disregarding his own advice on Day 1 of the Dorismond affair, which was to urge ''everyone not to jump to conclusions.'' In nothing flat, Mr. Giuliani then embarked on a campaign of mercilessly tearing the dead man down, even releasing (possibly unlawfully) Mr. Dorismond's sealed record as a juvenile offender.</p>
        <p>The mayor would have done well, many say, to bite his tongue and let the system prove on its own that it can work.</p>
