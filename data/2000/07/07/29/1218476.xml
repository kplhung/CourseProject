        <p>One week after the Yankees acquired Glenallen Hill from the Chicago Cubs to provide some right-handed punch to the lineup, he supplied a roundhouse tonight. In a 5-5 game with the bases loaded in the ninth at the Metrodome, Hill drove a pitch over the center-field fence, and those four runs were the difference in the Yankees' 9-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</p>
        <p>Mariano Rivera has had many saves for the Yankees, but his teammates are making a habit of saving him. For the second time this month, the Yankees came roaring back after Rivera allowed an opponent to take a lead in the late innings -- and it was the newest Yankee, Hill, who applied the coup de grace.</p>

        <p>One week after the Yankees acquired Glenallen Hill from the Chicago Cubs to provide some right-handed punch to the lineup, he supplied a roundhouse tonight. In a 5-5 game with the bases loaded in the ninth at the Metrodome, Hill drove a pitch over the center-field fence, and those four runs were the difference in the Yankees' 9-5 victory over the Minnesota Twins.</p>
        <p>Mariano Rivera has had many saves for the Yankees, but his teammates are making a habit of saving him. For the second time this month, the Yankees came roaring back after Rivera allowed an opponent to take a lead in the late innings -- and it was the newest Yankee, Hill, who applied the coup de grace.</p>
        <p>Hill's pinch-hit grand slam off Minnesota's Bob Wells came one batter after Jorge Posada had tied the game with his fourth hit of the night. Rivera, who had blown a two-run lead in the eighth, was credited with the victory.</p>
        <p>On July 17, the Yankees trailed Philadelphia by 6-1 in the ninth inning, scored five runs to tie, and after Rivera allowed two runs in the 10th, the Yankees scored three in the bottom of the 10th to win.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill led off the ninth tonight with a single off the left-hander Travis Miller. David Justice followed by ripping a line drive into the gap in right-center that bounced over the fence for a ground-rule double. Eddie Guardado fell behind Tino Martinez, three balls and no strikes, before he was walked intentionally, loading the bases.  BASEBALL</p>
