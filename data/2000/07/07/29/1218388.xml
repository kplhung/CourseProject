        <p>Just weeks before Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, is scheduled to make his first visit to Washington to discuss commercial relations with the United States, the Clinton Administration took the first steps yesterday toward filing a formal complaint against Mexico for failing to ensure open competition in its $12 billion telecommunications market.</p>
        <p>As she had warned several times since April, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, is asking the World Trade Organization to hold formal consultations between the United States and Mexico on the way Mexico supervises its recently deregulated telecommunications industry.</p>
        <p>Several American corporations, including AT&amp;T and WorldCom, have invested millions in Mexico since deregulation began in the mid-1990's. They have complained for the last year that they have been stymied by the actions of Telefonos de Mexico, the dominant carrier, and by weak-kneed Mexican regulators who have failed to stand up to the company, known as Telmex.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, along with Mexican partners, owns Alestra, a long-distance company. WorldCom owns a controlling share of Avantel, another long-distance company, also with Mexican associates.</p>
        <p>The trade representative accuses Telmex of several anticompetitive actions. The United States contends that Telmex overcharges to connect local calls to the long-distance networks, applies unfair fees for incoming international long-distance phone calls, and denies competitors the high-traffic lines they need for Internet service.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications regulators are accused of failing to properly enforce deregulation commitments that Mexico agreed to in 1998.</p>
        <p>The issue has become a sore point in commercial relations between the United States and Mexico, its second-largest trading partner, giving rise to harsh statements in a field usually noted for diplomatic restraint.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the regulatory system in Mexico is entirely broken,'' Ms. Barshefsky said in a conference call with reporters yesterday morning. She said she had little faith that Mexican officials in the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo would keep promises to resolve the regulatory issues before Mr. Fox is inaugurated on Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>''We've heard that song before,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In Mexico, Jorge Nicolin, president of the Federal Telecommunications Commission, said that the trade representative's complaint was ''unfounded and not substantiated.'' He said he was confident Mexico would successfully defend its position.</p>
        <p>''We've met with U.S.T.R. three times already this year and as we explain at every step, it is because we have competition in Mexico that we have these problems,'' he said.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Nicolin's count, 12 competing long-distance carriers operate in Mexico, along with 7 local carriers. He acknowledged that competitive problems exist, but said that formulation of new regulations to promote competition had been delayed by legal challenges from Telmex and other telephone companies. They should be ready by the end of October, he added.</p>
        <p>A Telmex spokesman, Arturo Elias Ayub, refuted the trade representative's claim that Telmex had actually increased its share of the long-distance market to 81 percent from 74 percent three years ago. ''We wish it were that high,'' he said, contending that Telmex handled no more than 60 percent.</p>
        <p>If no settlement is reached within 60 days after the World Trade Organization consultations begin, Ms. Barshefsky said the United States would file a formal complaint before the W.T.O.</p>
