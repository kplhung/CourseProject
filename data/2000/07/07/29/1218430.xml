        <p>After last year's record-breaking swelter and an unexpected blast of heat and humidity in early May, there were premonitions that this would be a horror movie summer of blackouts, wallet-busting utility bills and killer mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>Instead, last summer's triple-digit temperatures have been followed by one of the coolest Julys every recorded -- weather that has kept utility bills down and power plants operating, and has probably reduced the chances of a West Nile virus epidemic.</p>
        <p>For only the second time in a century, meteorologists say, July will have come and gone without the temperature's reaching 90 degrees. (Forecasters are predicting sporadic thunderstorms over the next two days, which would keep the temperature below 90.)  By contrast, the temperature topped 90 on 18 days in July 1999, including nine days when it exceeded 95 and two when it broke the 100-degree mark.</p>
        <p>As of yesterday, 6.9 inches of rain had fallen in New York City this month, compared with the normal July rainfall of 4.35 inches. Last July, only 0.44 of an inch of rain fell, the least amount of precipitation ever recorded in the city for that month.</p>
        <p>The unusually mild weather, and higher-than-normal rainfall, have taken the wind out of the various disaster predictions. Electricity use has been down, a relief to utility companies worried about the metropolitan region's limited power supply, officials said.</p>
        <p>And the weather has both hindered mosquito breeding and kept the bird population high, a boon to public health officials in their efforts to fight the West Nile virus -- although they caution that mosquito control efforts cannot be relaxed.</p>
        <p>''I never consider Mother Nature either kind or malevolent,'' said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. ''This is just part of one of those little natural variations that happen to be working a little bit in our favor right now.''</p>
        <p>So it seems. In favor of people who might otherwise be melting in the metropolitan sun. In favor of trees and plants experiencing ideal growth conditions after last year's drought. And in favor of summer activities to be savored and enjoyed rather than endured.</p>
        <p>At Jones Beach, attendance this July was up more than 25 percent over last July, said George Gorman, director of recreation for the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation on Long Island. The July 4 weekend set a record, with 568,000 people visiting the beach, he said.</p>
        <p>''Last year was a very hot, humid summer,'' Mr. Gorman said. ''We found that beachfront attendance went down and people went to more malls. They went to air-conditioned movie theaters and that type of thing.''</p>
        <p>The mild weather has been of particular relief to the people who have to worry about solving heat-related problems. In New York City, the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management has not had to activate its heat emergency plan at all this year.</p>
        <p>The plan, which is generally used when the heat index -- a measure of the combined effect of heat and humidity -- rises above 100, calls for public service announcements about heat-related illnesses, careful monitoring of people at risk for those illnesses, and the opening of public cooling centers.</p>
        <p>''I think the moderate weather has had a tangible impact on the city,'' said Richard J. Sheirer, the director of emergency management. ''We have seen E.M.S. runs have been lower. We have seen fewer heat-related illnesses. We have had a really quiet summer so far.''</p>
        <p>Across the New York region, many people said they were pleased with the mild weather, although several said yesterday that they felt soggy after a week of mostly rain and would not mind if things heated up a bit in August, if only to get the swimming pools jumping again.</p>
        <p>''It's been perfect,'' said Carter Reynolds, 50, of Short Hills, N.J. ''The rain at night waters the lawn and it looks so much better than last year. It's usually sunny without being too hot, and I like that. We have had the perfect balance of sun and rain this month.''</p>
        <p>But under overcast skies yesterday at the Pleasantville Pool in Westchester, the lifeguards, wearing sweatshirts and jogging pants, said they had tired of the cool weather. ''It's not fun sitting and watching water,'' said Beth Byrwa, looking at the empty pool and its smooth, glassy surface.</p>
        <p>The same rain that keeps people away from the swimming pool flushes away stagnant, fetid water that has built up and is used by mosquitoes to breed. And the low temperatures lengthen the breeding time for mosquitoes, experts said.</p>
        <p>The mosquitoes that carry the West Nile virus ''tend to breed in relatively unclean water,'' said Frank H. Collins, a biologist and mosquito expert at the University of Notre Dame. ''If there is a lot of water, a lot of rain, in many cases the larva is washed away.''</p>
        <p>But city officials said pesticide spraying and other control measures would continue aggressively as long as mosquitoes and larvae carrying the virus are detected in the city and until officials had a better understanding of the virus's patterns in the area.</p>
        <p>''This is a new disease for New York City,'' said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the City Health Department, ''and we have yet to see how it is going to maintain a foothold here.''</p>
        <p>During times of drought, birds tend to fly elsewhere in search of water, experts said, so the additional rain in the region also ensures that the bird population will be high enough to give the mosquitoes plenty of nonhuman food sources.</p>
        <p>On the flip side, the cooler weather also favors the common deer tick, which is a primary carrier of Lyme disease.</p>
        <p>''The number of ticks moving out on the lawn is sharply curtailed in hot, dry summers like we had last year,'' said Kirby Stafford, who monitors ticks for the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, ''and is increased quite a bit in cool, wetter summers like this year, which means people might be more exposed.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the insects are up to, people are using less power. In New York State, electricity customers have used 1.8 million fewer megawatt hours this July than they did last July, said Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, which administers the state power grid.</p>
        <p>This month, the average daily peak use statewide has been about 22,000 megawatts, more than 3,000 megawatts less than the average peak use last summer. ''In two words, it's been a wimpy July,'' Mr. Klapp said. ''The numbers kind of say it all.''</p>
        <p>The cool weather has benefited power utilities, he said, reducing stress on their systems. ''For reliability purposes, this is a relief because with demand down you have more supply available to work with in emergency situations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>D. Joy Faber, a spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison, said the company's forecast for peak use, which is usually reached during July, had been 11,825 megawatts for this year. But so far the highest power use was 10,378 megawatts, and that came on June 26, she said.</p>
        <p>Weekday peak use in July has averaged only 9,042 megawatts, far less than the 9,900 megawatts the company had expected.</p>
        <p>For plants, things could not be better. ''This has been an ideal growing season,'' said Bruce R. Fraedrich, a plant pathologist with Barlett Tree Experts, an East Coast tree service firm based in Charlotte, N.C. ''It doesn't get much better than this. Both the cooler temperatures and the added moisture is exactly what we needed after last year's drought conditions. The quality of foliage, the health of the trees -- all has been visually excellent.''</p>
        <p>Robert Snyder, superintendent of the Recreation and Parks Department in New Castle, N.Y., said the rain had kept his mowers busy.</p>
        <p>''The grass is growing like a weed,'' he said. ''You can hear it grow.''</p>
