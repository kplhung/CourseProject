        <p>Down a nondescript street, up two flights of worn concrete stairs, in a shabby converted apartment with peeling paint and no air conditioning, a dozen boys and young men were praying under the stern gaze of their rabbi.</p>
        <p>When they fumbled with the Hebrew, Rabbi Moshe Kishon nodded encouragement, recognizing that the language and the ritual are new to them.</p>
        <p>This is the Jewish College of Baku, a tiny beachhead in the religious revival stirring among Jews, Christians and Muslims in this former Soviet republic and elsewhere in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Members of all three religions are slowly shaking off seven decades of atheist Soviet doctrine and rediscovering their religious roots.</p>
        <p>Religion was an area of private life that Communism was dedicated to eliminate, not just control, so people are understandably rusty when it comes to prayer and other rituals of faith. Yet many here in the capital described a sense of longing for something to believe in since the collapse of the Soviet Union nearly a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''When I was a kid I felt very happy to be growing up in a Soviet republic, like most people here,'' said Haver Kambaizadeh, who works for an American energy company. ''Now there is a gap that needs to be filled.''</p>
        <p>In Azerbaijan, where religion dates to the Zoroastrian fire worshipers in the sixth or seventh century B.C., many different organizations are trying to fill that gap.</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of the population is Muslim, though their faith is more cultural and ethnic than religious. Few women wear scarves, and the muezzin's call to worship is rarely heard. Still, new mosques are opening. Often the only new building in a rural village is the mosque, paid for by a wealthy resident or by Iranians, who have tried to find fertile ground for proselytizing, to the discomfort of the government authorities.</p>
        <p>Christians make up 3 percent of the population, and the vast majority are Russian Orthodox. But since Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, evangelical Christians from the United States and Europe have tried to spread their word. The reception has not always been warm.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan is officially a secular state, but its Constitution allows the major faiths to practice without restriction. Still, laws prohibit religious ''propaganda'' by foreigners and require religious groups to register with the government.</p>
        <p>The police have used the laws to disrupt activities by Pentecostal and Jehovah's Witnesses groups. And Armenians are unable to worship, since their churches remain closed because of hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>Judaism is undergoing mild resurgence. About 18,000 ''Mountain Jews,'' who have been in the Caucasus for generations, maintain an enclave in northern Azerbaijan. Some 3,000 to 4,000 Jews, mostly descended from immigrants from Russia, live in Baku.</p>
        <p>Few in either group are observant. ''They have kept the traditions in a cultural sense, but they have been separated from active religion,'' said Andy David, a diplomat with the Israeli Embassy here. ''They have forgotten how to pray.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Kishon is determined to change that through a revival of Orthodox Judaism. Since arriving from Israel four years ago, he has opened a state-approved school for 230 elementary and high school students and a kitchen that provides meals for the needy. This fall in Baku, he will open the first yeshiva in the Caucasus in four centuries. Financing comes from Jewish groups in Brooklyn and in Lakewood, N.J., both strongholds of Orthodoxy.</p>
        <p>''Our philosophy is to help all the Jews in these countries,'' Rabbi Kishon said.</p>
        <p>Then there is the Hebrew school with the grand name, the Jewish College of Baku.</p>
        <p>Students trickled up the stairs and into the school in clusters of twos and threes in the afternoon, wearing skullcaps and carrying prayer books printed in Hebrew and Azerbaijani on the school's computers. They sipped tea and told jokes until the rabbi arrived for the classes and then prayer.</p>
        <p>As the sound of honking cars and shouts in Russian and Azerbaijani drifted through the open windows, the students faced the walls of the room and recited their prayers as they rocked back and forth in the traditional practice of davening.</p>
        <p>The star student this particular evening was Gilad Pashayev, a dark-haired 15-year-old who also attends the Jewish high school. He recited his prayers earnestly and smoothly. Later, as his comrades giggled and jostled, Gilad described his reasons for attending Hebrew school and the religious high school, State School 46.</p>
        <p>''Before, my family never went to synagogue and didn't pray, but we did observe some Jewish holidays,'' he explained. ''My great-grandfather was an observant Jew, and that's what I want to be too. I like walking the city, and I like learning the traditions of my religion.''</p>
        <p>Gilad persuaded his parents to attend services at the small synagogue near the school, which serves Jews of European descent. A few blocks away, Baku's other synagogue, equally small, is attended by Mountain Jews who have migrated to the city.</p>
        <p>The kitchen is kosher and feeds elderly Jews and other needy people in the neighborhood. The rabbi beamed as the heavy metal doors to the kitchen's storehouse opened to reveal an odd sight in this Muslim country: shelves lined with Mrs. Adler's gefilte fish, Gefen kosher dill pickles and other goods shipped from America.</p>
        <p>Last Passover, he said, the kitchen distributed free matzo.</p>
