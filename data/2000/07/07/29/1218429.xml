        <p>''I'm looking for some Bush to whack,'' Harry Fred Scott, a retired postal worker and dedicated Democrat, growled today in his East Texas drawl as he boarded the coach bus loaded with boisterous Texans and emblazoned with a blue banner that read, ''Don't mess with America.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to his governor, George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. And whack away he did. In Cincinnati, he and his fellow Texans asserted that their state lagged behind the nation in school test scores. In Dayton, they complained about a dysfunctional health care system. In Columbus, they fretted about smog-filled skies.</p>
        <p>''We have soccer moms whose children can't play soccer'' because of air pollution, Tamara Maschino told reporters outside a senior center here. ''And I hold George W. Bush personally responsible.''</p>
        <p>From the Democratic National Committee, the people who came up with the chicken that chased President George Bush in 1992 and the cigarette that dogged Bob Dole in 1996, comes the party's newest tool of disruption: the Texas Truth Squad, 14 elected officials and citizens bearing tales of George Bush-induced woe from the Lone Star State.</p>
        <p>They have traveled through Kentucky and Ohio on their way to West Virginia and Philadelphia, where the Republican National Convention will begin on Monday. Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, are expected to take the same route on their way to the convention, and the Democrats wanted to get there first to muddy the waters a bit.</p>
        <p>''The Bushes are coming and the Bushes will get you,'' Mr. Scott bellowed at older citizens in Dayton.</p>
        <p>The Truth Squad is just one cog in the Democratic machine created to  mock and contradict the Republicans during their convention.</p>
        <p>Throughout the week, a team of surrogate speakers, led by the party's chairmen, Joe Andrew and Edward G. Rendell, will hold daily news conferences attacking the Republican ticket. The party has purchased billboard space near the convention center carrying the message: ''I know what you did in Texas.'' A Web site loaded with anti-Bush broadsides will go online on Sunday, at www.iknowwhatyoudidintexas.net.</p>
        <p>At the heart of it all, teams of researchers at the national committee's offices in Washington and the Gore 2000 headquarters in Nashville will issue floods of faxes and e-mail messages in a minute-by-minute effort to rebut virtually everything every Republican says from the convention stage in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The nameless and faceless researchers are the engine that drives much of the Democratic troublemaking. In Nashville, they are known as ''the men and women of zeal'' because they are all 20-somethings who work 18-hour days scanning the Internet, watching television and reading newspapers in search of stray scraps of damaging information about their foes.</p>
        <p>''I call this the slaughterhouse,'' said Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, as she strolled into the team's glassed-enclosed office in Nashville recently. ''They may look like gentle people. But they are killers.''</p>
        <p>Led by David Ginsberg, a pot-bellied, chain-smoking, bearded, balding and brainy 25-year-old, the Gore researchers were often stunningly successful in undermining the daily messages of Bill Bradley during the Democratic primaries.</p>
        <p>In Iowa, they inundated reporters with information about a vote Mr. Bradley cast against flood relief for farmers, and the issue dogged Mr. Bradley for days. Later, when Mr. Bradley attacked Mr. Gore for supporting the tobacco industry two decades ago, Mr. Ginsberg was ready with a compilation of quotes from Mr. Bradley vowing to avoid negative campaigning.</p>
        <p>More recently, the Gore team's researchers pulled repeated all-nighters compiling thick dossiers on every potential Republican vice-presidential candidate. The one man they failed to study closely was the one who was chosen. But as soon as Mr. Cheney's name emerged last weekend, they went into overdrive. And the moment Mr. Bush made his choice official on Tuesday morning, Mr. Ginsberg had already distributed a detailed analysis of Mr. Cheney's voting record in Congress, which was so conservative that it surprised even some Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I think we vetted Cheney better than Bush did,'' one adviser to Mr. Gore bragged.</p>
        <p>The Democrats also firmly believe that good research fuels better pranks. When a D.N.C. researcher learned that the Bush campaign was selling George W. Bush bottled water that came from Kentucky, they ordered several cases and gave it out to reporters.</p>
        <p>''This is George W. Bush's message in a bottle,'' Mr. Andrew said at a news conference in Oregon last Tuesday. ''Don't drink the water in Texas.''</p>
