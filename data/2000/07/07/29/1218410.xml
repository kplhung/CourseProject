        <p>WHEN Mayor John F. Street set out in politics 20 years ago, he was a classic insurgent firebrand, living and breathing protest as he belabored incumbents for neglecting the outlying neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The urban wheel has come full circle for Mr. Street, the powerful incumbent of the nation's fifth-largest city. For he now must make sure that political protesters have their say but not to the point of disrupting the delegates of the Republican National Convention who began flooding into town today intent on enjoying the downtown renaissance of this historic city.</p>
        <p>Assorted protest causes, vowing to rally by the tens of thousands, also began arriving, closely tracked by the mayor's police aides. The protesters are flocking to this city not so much for the Republican gathering as for the journalists, who outnumber the delegates three to one and who are constructing a weeklong window for the watching nation to get some messages.</p>
        <p>''There are some people who believe their rights are the only rights,'' Mr. Street declared, the Afro hairdo of his protest youth winnowed and gray, but his instinct for contention still sharp as he flourishes it in protection of the downtown establishment. Watching from City Hall, he pondered the ''very small percentage'' of arriving protesters who he estimates may be intent on confounding the city's hard-earned new image with hit-and-run street vandalism.</p>
        <p>''We can't allow people to destroy Philadelphia,'' Mr. Street declared.</p>
        <p>He had to sigh and smile in confirming a report in George magazine that, yes, he did refer to the approach of some protest ''idiots'' and he did vow they would get ''a very ugly response'' for any disruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Street said that was merely a light-hearted summary of a serious point: Philadelphia intends to welcome peaceful protesters and accommodate nonviolent civil disobedience with professional nonaggressive arrests. But this city also intends to protect its hospitality and property from the sort of masked vandals who marauded through downtown Seattle in December during the meeting of the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>As the Republicans packed into dozens of new and renovated hotels, Mr. Street contemplated his welcome speech for the conventioneers. But potential troublemakers never seemed far from mind. ''We don't get intimidated,'' the mayor said. ''Besides, protesters have to eat, too,'' he added, brightening at the tourist lucre that might be mined in dissent. ''They go to restaurants.''</p>
        <p>At the age of 56, Mr. Street is at a critical test of his political career. If the city fails to sparkle during the convention, he will be blamed. But if the Republicans turn out to relish this revived and thoroughly Democratic city, he could be well on his way to re-election despite such haunting problems as the city's continuing population loss in the face of a failed school system.</p>
        <p>The stakes in having the nation focus on Philadelphia were underlined two weeks ago with the sensational airing of television footage of a half-dozen frustrated police officers finally capturing a fugitive car-jacking suspect and drubbing him with kicks and punches. Afterward, officials promised subtler tactics for any convention disturbances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Street won a tough race in November by a two-point margin. He sought to come roaring into office as the successor to the highly popular Edward G. Rendell, who engineered the downtown revival with key help from Mr. Street as City Council president. Mr. Street soon delivered on a promise to have 30,000 skeletal automobiles hauled away. He dispatched plows to the humblest streets during a snowstorm. After a magazine criticized the chubbier residents of this city of cheese steak and pretzel noshing, the mayor, a predawn exercise fanatic, rushed to defend his own on the Oprah show.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Street received poor reviews in his early relations with the Statehouse as Republicans complained he was obstinate and demanding in the annual school aid fight. He had also been considered iron-handed in his council presidency, yet this was a quality that helped him deliver crucial investment votes on the revival of downtown.</p>
        <p>''In the hospitality-tourism business, you've got to pay to play,'' said Mr. Street, who preferred to dwell on the tourist riches of Republican visitors rather than their ticket. ''For us, this is a business. It's time to capitalize on our investment.''</p>
        <p>BORN poor on a suburban farm, Mr. Street identifies closely with this city and the possibilities of the underdog to rise up. As a student, he was rated less than college material by one teacher. But Mr. Street used this as a prod to persist. He ultimately earned a law degree at Temple University to complement the firebrand protests of his entry to politics. The mayor lives in North Philadelphia, has four children with his wife, Naomi, a lawyer and children's advocate in the city.</p>
        <p>''When I began in politics, we didn't have tall buildings; there was virtually no skyline,'' said Mr. Street, sounding genuinely amazed that the city's stark old silhouette could have vanished. Instead, a cluster of shiny new office towers and hotels defines a bold, aspiring skyline. They dwarf the classic century-old City Hall, where Mr. Street will be anxiously governing, watching the intertwined fates of conventioneers, protesters and his beloved Philadelphia.</p>
