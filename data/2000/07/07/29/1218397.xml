        <p>Stocks tumbled yesterday as a report of unexpectedly strong economic growth increased the threat of another Federal Reserve interest rate increase.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index plunged 4.7 percent, finishing the week off 10.5 percent, its third worst week ever. Its technology stocks have been under pressure for more than a week because of concerns about weaker corporate earnings in the second half of the year. And that concern has begun to spread, adding to the selling pressure yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent.</p>
        <p>But interest rates rose only slightly, probably because inflation remained in check despite the strong second-quarter growth.</p>
        <p>A strong economy is usually positive for stocks because growth is good for corporate earnings. But at a time when the nation's central bank has pledged to slow the economy's growth to a noninflationary pace, the 5.2 percent second-quarter surge in the gross domestic product that the Commerce Department reported yesterday was read as a negative.</p>
        <p>The jolt from the report was intensified by two factors. One was the surprise. Most economists had been expecting the economy to slow to a pace of around 3.5 percent to 4 percent, from over 5 percent in the first quarter. ''Signs of a slowing economy are hard to find in this latest batch of numbers,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.</p>
        <p>In addition, many investors had begun to think that the Fed might be finished with its interest rate increases, after pushing up its benchmark federal funds rate six times, to 6.5 percent, since June 1999. The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, may have inadvertently re-enforced this view when he outlined the reasons he believed growth was slowing when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee July 20.</p>
        <p>But another rate increase is still not a certainty, some analysts argued. This is because the data yesterday also reflected several positive trends: a slowdown in consumer spending, contained inflationary pressures and strong business investment that could lead to even higher worker productivity.</p>
        <p>It has been the surprising increase in worker productivity the last several years that has allowed the economy, which is now in its longest expansion on record, to grow briskly without a surge in inflation. And Mr. Greenspan indicated in his recent testimony that if these positive trends continued, a rate increase might be avoided.</p>
        <p>So the path between now and the Fed's policy-making meeting Aug. 22 could be bumpy. The data for July, which will be released between now and then, including that on jobs, retail sales and consumer inflation, will probably determine what the Fed does, a point that Mr. Greenspan made in his appearance before Congress on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''If the consumer looks like he is ramping up again, then that is a threat,'' said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glassman thinks the pace of consumer spending is slowing, in part because higher oil and gasoline prices are cutting into income and in part because some big companies are worried about sales slowing in the second half of the year. But yesterday's data, along with the June jumps in existing-home sales and orders for durable goods and the July increase in consumer confidence, do give him pause. Even so, he is still not predicting a rate increase in August.</p>
        <p>William Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, thinks consumer spending has not slowed significantly. Instead, he argued that the 3 percent growth in spending in the second quarter, down from 7.7 percent in the first quarter, was just a pause. The key for Fed policy makers and investors, he said, ''is why did the consumer pull back in the second quarter and will it continue.''</p>
        <p>He expects another interest rate increase in August. ''This idea that the Fed is done with tightening is premature because the economy has more momentum than people think,'' Mr. Dudley said.</p>
        <p>Only a small rally in the last minutes of trading prevented all three major stock indexes from ending at their lows for the day. The Nasdaq composite index fell 179.23 points, to 3,663.00, led lower by Cisco Systems, JDS Uniphase and Intel. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which includes many of the same big technology stocks that pulled down the Nasdaq, dropped 29.73 points, or 2.05 percent, to 1,419.89. The Dow, which has a lighter load of technology stocks, dropped 74.96 points, to 10,511.17. The Dow was led lower by declines at American Express and J. P. Morgan &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Dow was down 2.1 percent, while the S.&amp; P. was off 4.1 percent. For the year, all three indexes are down, with the Nasdaq off 10 percent, the Dow down 8.6 percent and the S.&amp; P. slipping 3.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite yesterday's selling, the stock of Corvis, a maker of equipment for fiber optic cables, more than doubled on its first day of trading. The stock jumped 48 23/32, to 84 23/32, although the company has yet to show any revenue.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices and yields were little changed as one measure of inflation in the gross domestic price data showed price increases falling to a rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter from 3.3 percent in the first. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.03 percent, from 6.00 percent on Thursday. The note's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 8/32, to 1031 2/32.</p>
        <p>The confusion among investors about what the Fed might do is understandable because the central bank's job is not just to slow the pace of economic growth. Instead, policy makers want to slow growth to a noninflationary pace. But as they are trying to do this, the acceptable noninflationary speed limit for growth is rising because of stronger worker productivity. The Fed's speed limit has already jumped from around 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the early 1990's to 3.5 percent to 4 percent now. And who knows whether it will move higher.</p>
        <p>''If people are disoriented, it certainly makes sense,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''We are not used to this type of growth.''</p>
