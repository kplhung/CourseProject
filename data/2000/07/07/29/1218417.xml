      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Two federal appeals judges in Northern California delivered a last-minute reprieve for Napster Inc. this afternoon, overriding a judge's injunction and ruling that the Internet music-swapping service could continue to allow its users to trade copyrighted music.</p>
        <p>The unexpected decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in California, stayed the preliminary injunction issued against Napster on Wednesday by Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the United States District Court in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>After finding a high probability that she would decide against Napster at trial, Judge Patel ordered the company to stop its users from trading copyrighted songs. Napster said the order, which would have taken effect at midnight Friday, Pacific time, would have crippled the service, since it was impossible for it to distinguish which music was copyrighted and which was not.</p>
        <p>But the appeals judges said today that ''substantial questions'' had been raised about the ''merits and form of the injunction.''</p>
        <p>Napster, which says it has more than 20 million users, is an Internet search engine that enables users to find and trade songs between computers. It was sued in December by major record companies, represented by the Recording Industry Association of America, which accused Napster of contributing to copyright infringement.</p>
        <p>Napster's chief executive, Hank Barry, said today that he was ''gratified and appreciative'' of the ruling, which will last until a three-judge appeals court panel can hear arguments on whether the injunction should be lifted.</p>
        <p>That hearing has yet to be scheduled, but it will come shortly after the panel finishes taking written arguments on Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>Shawn Fanning, who created Napster last year as a freshman at Northeastern University, said today, ''I am happy and grateful that we do not have to turn away our 20 million users and that we can continue to help artists.''</p>
        <p>The Recording Industry Association of America could appeal today's decision, either to the full Ninth Circuit Court or to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Hilary Rosen, president of the recording association, said she was disappointed.</p>
        <p>''The Court of Appeals decision today granting Napster a temporary stay of the preliminary injunction is obviously a disappointment, but we remain confident that the court will ultimately affirm once it has had an opportunity to review the facts and the law,'' Ms. Rosen said today.</p>
        <p>''It is frustrating, of course, that the tens of millions of daily infringements occurring on Napster will be able to continue, at least temporarily.''</p>
        <p>While the ruling buys Napster time, it does nothing to change Judge Patel's apparent distaste for the company, said Dave Goldberg, chief executive of Launch Media, an Internet music company that works with both new-media companies and traditional music companies.</p>
        <p>''I don't think in the long run its going to make much difference,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''All this does is a stay of execution. Its not any determination of right or wrong. You've got a trial judge who it looks like has already decided what the result's going to be at trial.''</p>
        <p>Since being created last year by Mr. Fanning, Napster has become one of the Internet's fastest-growing Web sites. The free service enables users to swap songs, in the form of MP3 files, between their computers.</p>
        <p>About 500,000 to 800,000 people use Napster daily, or 1 to 2 percent of United States Internet users, according to Nielsen/Net Ratings, an Internet audience measurement service, though other experts say that estimate is probably low.</p>
        <p>''I love Napster, and all my friends do, too,'' said Cyrus Kharas, 14, of Chevy Chase, Md. ''My friends and I, we get home at 11:30 or midnight from a movie, or whatever, and the first thing we do is start downloading from Napster.''</p>
        <p>But the record industry argues that Napster operates nothing more than a flea market filled with stolen property -- copyrighted songs that must otherwise be purchased in stores. And some Napster users acknowledge that they use the service as a way to avoid paying for music.</p>
        <p>''I like the idea of having this service for free,'' Cyrus Kharas said. ''I don't think I would pay for MP3 service. Getting it without paying is part of the fun, you know.''</p>
        <p>Napster argues that it actually helps the record companies by enabling listeners to preview songs free that they will then buy as CD's. It also argues that its users should be allowed to trade songs with each other for their personal use, just as they can tape CD's they have purchased for their own use.</p>
