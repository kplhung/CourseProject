        <p>Anthony W. Koncel, a pilot with 30 years of experience, was settling in at the instrument panel on Thursday night and preparing for another run of National Airlines Flight 19 from New York to Las Vegas when the door of the cockpit burst open.</p>
        <p>''This guy came into the cockpit, put a gun to my head, and said, 'Go south -- I'm taking over the airplane,' '' said Mr. Koncel, recalling his two-and-a-half-hour ordeal as a hostage on his own airplane. ''We said, 'South where?' He came back with, 'Miami.' ''</p>
        <p>As heavily armed police officers from a special unit boarded the Boeing 757 at Kennedy International Airport and helped the last of the 143 passengers to escape -- many by sliding down an inflatable chute in the rear of the plane -- Mr. Koncel and his co-pilot, Sean Walkerley, were held captive by a nervous young man who kept changing his mind about where he wanted the plane to go: first Miami, then Buenos Aires, finally Antarctica.</p>
        <p>With a metallic gray Smith &amp; Wesson 10-millimeter pistol trained at his head, Mr. Koncel, 48, showed the gunman how to use the cockpit's radio so he could talk to the police negotiators who were trying to coax him to surrender. The pilot listened in silence as the gunman claimed that the United States government was cloning humans and that he had been deported from Argentina for weapons smuggling.</p>
        <p>After what seemed like ages, Mr. Koncel said, the negotiations proved successful. At 12:09 yesterday morning, the gunman agreed to free Mr. Koncel. A half-hour later he released Mr. Walkerley. Finally, at 3:38, the gunman surrendered peacefully. and was led out of the airplane in handcuffs. The police identified him as Aaron Amartei Commey, a 22-year-old Bronx native who had lived most recently in Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey was arraigned yesterday afternoon in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on charges of attempted air piracy, and Magistrate Judge A. Simon Chrein ordered him held until he undergoes a psychiatric evaluation. The judge said that Mr. Commey had no criminal history but noted that he had admitted in a pre-arraignment report to having some problems with ''exercises in fantasy.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that Mr. Commey had admitted to planning to take over an airplane for months. They said that he told investigators that he would have used the handgun and hunting knife he was carrying against anyone who disobeyed his orders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey's defense lawyer, Michael K. Schneider, said that he decided to ask the judge to order the psychiatric evaluation after speaking with his client for an hour. ''It seems like a sad case,'' said Mr. Schneider, a public defender. ''A 22-year-old man apparently hijacking a plane to go to Antarctica.''</p>
        <p>Investigators believe that Mr. Commey left Milwaukee by bus on Tuesday, arriving in New York on Wednesday morning. He told investigators that he left a bag with a shotgun and 25 shells in the Port Authority Bus Terminal, then spent much of the next day and a half riding the subway aimlessly, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>At around 10:26 Thursday night, officials said, Mr. Commey, wearing a large white button-down shirt and dark blue carpenter's pants with loops and pockets on the legs, arrived at Terminal 4, an international terminal at Kennedy Airport.</p>
        <p>Unlike most airport terminals, whose security checkpoints are a good distance away from the departure gates, the security checkpoints at Terminal 4 are at each gate, less than 50 feet from the entrance to the airplanes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey simply walked up to the metal detector and X-ray machine at Gate 33 and kept on walking,  the police said. When one of the unarmed security guards stationed at the checkpoint challenged him, the police said, he pulled out his gun and kept on walking onto the jetway and into the plane.</p>
        <p>Passengers said that Mr. Commey placed his finger to his lips, signaling  them to be quiet, as he walked into the cabin. Frank Clark, 30, a computer engineer from Brooklyn, was sitting in first class sipping a drink when he heard a noise by the door. ''I heard some commotion going on at the hatch,'' he said. ''I heard a guy say 'Just close the hatch.' He went right up to the cockpit.''</p>
        <p>Back at the gate, the stunned security guards had pressed a button, calling for help. Soon the call went out across the airport: a man with a gun had breached security.</p>
        <p>By chance, Andrew Anderson and Richard Miller, two emergency service officers with the Port Authority Police Department, were driving one of the department's armored cars about 100 yards away from the plane when they got the call.</p>
        <p>They drove to the gate, where a ramp worker told them that the gunman was on the plane. They ran up the jetway, where a few passengers were already beginning to flee, and entered the cabin.</p>
        <p>''It's like a fireman running to a burning building -- everybody's running out, you're running in,'' Officer Miller said. ''Same principle. Your training kicks in.''</p>
        <p>Once they were on the plane, a flight attendant told them the gunman was in the cockpit. There were still about a hundred people on the plane. Officer Anderson said that he and his partner positioned themselves in the center aisle, facing the cockpit, and told the flight attendant to open the inflatable chute and have the passengers evacuate the plane.</p>
        <p>''Everyone looked pretty scared, and a few were panicking,'' he said. ''Some elderly people were having trouble. It seemed like an eternity before they were off.''</p>
        <p>Once alone on the plane, the officers took cover behind two drink carts and watched the cockpit door as they waited for backup officers and help from the New York Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>Hostage negotiators took positions below the airplane and tried to talk the gunman out of the cockpit. Everyone waited.</p>
        <p>Inside the cockpit, Mr. Koncel listened to Mr. Commey talk with the negotiators. ''He was really paranoid,'' Mr. Koncel said. ''A lot of what he said didn't make sense at all. He said that he had had a run-in in Argentina, and was deported to the U.S. for smuggling weapons into Buenos Aires.''</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials confirmed that Mr. Commey made that claim, but said that they had been unable to verify it. At one point in the discussion, however, he insisted on talking with the consul general of Argentina. The police sent a squad car to the bewildered diplomat's residence and raced him out to the airport to be on hand.</p>
        <p>''The impression people had was that he was a little unstable,'' the consul general, Guillermo J. McGough, said after it was all over. ''There was no reason for him to ask for the consulate of Argentina. If you put together his request for me and his decision to go to Antarctica, there is a pretty big loop in between.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Commey also spent part of his time in the cockpit speaking about cloning. ''He said that they had been cloning people in the United States for a long time,'' Mr. Koncel said. ''He was just rambling.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Koncel and Mr. Walkerley were released, the police negotiators kept talking, hoping to end the standoff peacefully. The gunman spoke of suicide, a police official said, and some investigators feared he would do something to force one of the police officers on the scene to shoot him. But the negotiators kept talking, and he calmed down.</p>
        <p>Finally, just after 3:30 a.m., the gunman had a new demand: he wanted to wash his face. ''He wanted to wipe his face, to freshen up,'' a police official said. ''We told him it would be O.K., and he agreed to come out.''</p>
