        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Brent Staples (''How Slavery Fueled Business in the North,'' Editorial Observer, July 24) recounts the efforts of Deadria Farmer-Paellmann to exact reparations from modern companies that may have benefited from slavery in the 1800's.</p>
        <p>To support their arguments, both appear to be looking at efforts in modern Germany. Mr. Staples, for example, said efforts within Germany ''will compensate people who worked as slave laborers in Germany during World War II.''</p>

        <p>If this is indeed the motivation for the activism of Ms. Farmer-Paellmann, please note that German compensation will be to the slave laborers and forced laborers who are still alive; no compensation has been directed for family members, survivors or descendants. Also, the payments range from up to $2,500 to $7,500.</p>
