        <p>A security guard who was returning home from work was injured yesterday morning when a 30-pound chunk of cast-iron facade fell off a building in Midtown Manhattan, a Fire Department official said.</p>
        <p>Andrew Anowai, 41, of the Bronx, was struck about 7 a.m. by a piece of metal from 1720 Broadway, near 33rd Street, said Firefighter Robert Calise.</p>
        <p>He was taken to Bellevue Medical Center, where he was expected to remain for several days for head, should and arm trauma, according to John Clark, a hospital administrator.  He was in stable condition last night.</p>
        <p>Several people have been struck by falling debris in recent weeks. On July 18, a tourist walking in Midtown suffered a fractured skull when a 25-pound stucco ornament loosened and fell 14 stories, knocking him unconscious. On July 19, a young woman was struck in the head by a brick that fell from a building undergoing renovation on the Lower East Side.</p>
