        <p>The nine people wounded by a bomb on Thursday in Dusseldorf are immigrants, with six of them Jews, the police and prosecutors said today.</p>
        <p>Johannes Mocken, a spokesman for state prosecutors in the western city, said the victims had just left their daily German class at a language school when the bomb exploded on a metal footbridge leading to a commuter station. ''We cannot exclude that somebody purposefully intended to kill members of this group,'' Mr. Mocken said.</p>
        <p>Interior Minister Otto Schily said it was reasonable to assume that the attack had a racist motive.</p>
        <p>The leader of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Paul Spiegel, said: ''I don't want to create any hysteria. But the fact is most of the victims were Jewish, and it appears that they passed on the same route from school every day.''</p>
        <p>The number of Jews in Germany has been growing rapidly over the last decade, bolstered by waves of immigrants from the former Soviet Union drawn here by the relative ease of obtaining residence papers and generous financial aid. The country has 85,000 registered Jews compared with 29,000 at the beginning of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>A bombing against those immigrants would be a blow to Germany's international image and a worrying indication that the extreme right is becoming bolder and more organized.</p>
        <p>But no organization, rightist or other, has claimed responsibility for the bombing. The police said all possible motives, including reports of a feud among the immigrants, remained under examination.</p>
        <p>One of the wounded, identified by the police only as Tatyana, 26, was 6 months pregnant. The unborn child was killed when shrapnel pierced her stomach. Her condition, and that of her husband, Michael, 28, were listed as critical. Two other people were listed in serious condition.</p>
        <p>The immigrants came from Azerbaijan, Russia and Ukraine, the police said. Their German lessons were part of the government's aid for immigrants, and the group was about to board a train to nearby Solingen, where five Turkish women and girls were killed in 1993 in a racist firebombing.</p>
        <p>Anti-immigrant violence has steadily risen in Germany in the 1990's, spurred by high unemployment, frustration among idle youths and well-organized, if marginal, neo-Nazi movements.</p>
        <p>Last month, a 39-year-old black immigrant from Mozambique was beaten to death by neo-Nazi skinheads in the eastern town of Dessau, and the police dismantled what they described as a highly organized and heavily armed rightist youth group near Dresden, finding grenades, ignition devices and parts of rockets.</p>
        <p>The openness to Jewish immigration is rooted in a deep-seated political conviction that the Holocaust makes any other policy unthinkable, as well as a calculation that such receptiveness is generally good for Germany as it asserts its growing economic power, particularly in the United States.</p>
        <p>But protracted recent negotiations over compensation for Nazi-era slave and forced laborers showed a growing, if still rarely expressed, impatience with what is sometimes described as ''Jewish blackmail.'' In October, more than 100 headstones in Europe's largest Jewish cemetery, in Berlin, were smashed or overturned.</p>
        <p>Dusseldorf has been a major center of Jewish immigration. Michael Szentei-Heife, leader of the branch of the Jewish council there, said 6,300 Jews lived in the area, with 5,100 being recent Russian emigres. Their move stems from a decision to accept Jews from the former Soviet Union by Helmut Kohl, who was then the chancellor, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell.</p>
        <p>But that decision was never the subject of a parliamentary vote or national debate, and the public view of the de facto rebuilding of a German Jewish community all but extinguished by Hitler remains unclear.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said this week that anti-immigrant violence by rightist groups had reached unacceptable levels.</p>
