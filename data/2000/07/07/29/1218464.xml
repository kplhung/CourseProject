        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''How Slavery Fueled Business in the North,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, July 24):</p>
        <p>Those who promote the idea of reparations in its various forms are doing a great disservice to the African-American community. While the case for reparations based on events in the 19th century is dubious at best, one thing is certain. No legislature in the country will ever vote for reparations, because to do so would be political suicide.</p>
        <p>Making this unrealistic hope a cause celebre for many African-Americans distracts attention and effort from what can really help raise those of any race who are mired in poverty: education and the adoption of middle-class values and morals.</p>
        <p>This is how the large African-American middle class achieved its success, not by waiting for government largess.</p>
