        <p>It is a midsummer mystery: The Case of the Missing Lifeguard.</p>
        <p>Except that unlike a good beach read, it has no guarantee of a neat solution, and the suffering of those who wait and pray and weep at night is only too real.</p>
        <p>Exactly one month ago, 16-year-old Molly Ann Bish, a 5-foot-7, 127-pound, honey-blond athlete, reported for her eighth day of work as a lifeguard at Comins Pond, a serene pool ringed by pines, with a water slide and a small beach. It is a popular swimming hole, especially for young children, here in this country town about 70 miles west of Boston. It even smells of summer, that dank tang of standing fresh water.</p>
        <p>Molly's mother dropped her off as her workday began at 10 a.m. She set up her things for the day: beach chair, flip-flops, two-way radio, the lunch her mother had packed her.</p>
        <p>Then she disappeared.</p>
        <p>Less than a half-hour later, the first bathers arrived, and found there was no lifeguard, though a first-aid kit lay open by the chair. Molly has not been seen again, at least not by anyone in this town that has just about gone wild looking.</p>
        <p>Thanks in part to a local company that makes ribbons, no village could ever have been more thoroughly trimmed in yellow -- Molly's favorite color -- even at the very height of the Persian Gulf war. The ribbons adorn telephone poles, car antennas,  even the columns of the town hall.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of townspeople have attended candle-lighted vigils on the town common, gone out to help the professional searchers, fed to the gills the two dozen state detectives working nonstop on the case, kept up a steady stream of comfort calls on John and Magi Bish, Molly's parents.</p>
        <p>The Bishes have also received more than 700 sympathy cards, and, they said, the cards help, baskets of them lying at their feet near a shelf holding a candle flickering before Molly's junior prom picture. The Bishes are also more grateful than they can say for the policework and the town's outpouring of love and aid and food. But as the days pass, the ordeal only gets worse.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult for me at nighttime, because that's when the fears come,'' said Magi Bish, a special-education teacher and former stay-at-home mother to Molly and her two older siblings. ''I do a lot of crying, and use a rosary.''</p>
        <p>By the one-month mark, Mrs. Bish said, the hope that Molly is still alive is flickering.</p>
        <p>But ''the hardest fear,'' she said, ''is if she's out there somewhere and someone's hurting her. If she's gone to heaven I can make peace with it, but the fear is the worst.''</p>
        <p>A disappearance like Molly's is relatively unusual, experts on child abductions say. Of the 850,000 children who are reported missing each year, said Jerry Nance, a case manager with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, only 3 percent or 4 percent are considered ''missing and endangered,'' that is, neither runaways nor taken by a family member.</p>
        <p>According to Department of Justice figures, 300 children each year are abducted by non-family members and are gone for a long time or killed. In all, 4,600 abductions by non-family members nationwide are reported to the police each year, compared with 354,000 children taken by family members and 450,700 who run away.</p>
        <p>Molly's case has other unusual elements, Mr. Nance said: ''She's older than most. It was daylight. She was at a workplace where people would have known her. The whole window of opportunity for the guy to have struck was very small, only 20 minutes.''</p>
        <p>State police refused today to discuss the investigation, even as nearly 200 cadets from a nearby police academy set out into the woods to practice search techniques. But the authorities are considering lowering the level of the pond to search in marshy areas.</p>
        <p>It appears highly unlikely that Molly ran away -- a responsible teenager on a welcomed new job, packing nothing, leaving her shoes. And police checks into sex offenders living in the area have apparently yielded no breakthroughs.</p>
        <p>According to the Bish family, there is one strong lead: a suspicious-looking fiftyish man with a mustache whom Magi Bish had observed sitting in a white car in the pond parking lot the day before Molly disappeared. She fixed him with a ''What are you doing here?'' look, Mrs. Bish said, and eventually he drove off.</p>
        <p>Though sketches of the man are plastered next to posters of Molly on store windows, ''this individual has not been found,'' Mrs. Bish said. ''It would help us immensely if he came forward.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Bishes are trying to turn their pain into something positive by talking about Molly -- her goofy charm, her good grades and her kindness to special-needs children -- and warning other parents that this could happen to them.</p>
        <p>''We're concerned that children aren't safe,'' said Mr. Bish, a probation officer. ''Now we know we have to redouble our efforts; everyone has to. Molly goes to work at a beach known for its safety and ends up in harm's way. Everyone needs to be informed about this type of situation to prevent it from happening again.''</p>
        <p>Molly's parents are convinced, they say, that someone lured her into trouble by pretending to need her help. There was no sign of struggle,  but they presume some force may have been involved.</p>
        <p>The possibility that the abductor was a local resident who could still be around adds a tinge of suspicion to the town's crisis-time solidarity.</p>
        <p>''I can't understand how anyone would do something like this,'' Marilyn Coltey, a schoolteacher, said, ''so you start looking at everyone and wondering who could it be.''</p>
        <p>Some local parents have told Magi Bish that their children, frightened, have been asking to share beds with each other or their parents more than usual, and many parents seem to be heeding John Bish's advice that they cannot be too overprotective.</p>
        <p>''My daughter has a 2-year-old and she won't let the kid out of her sight now,'' said Gary Bateman, owner of the Warren Spa and Package Store.</p>
        <p>Among the cards the Bish family has received are two from other members of the saddest of fraternities: parents whose young daughters were abducted. The remains of one of the girls, a 9-year-old, turned up years later in some woods in the Boston suburb where she disappeared; the body of the other, a 10-year-old, turned up two months later in a town just miles from here. Neither crime has been solved.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 2, Molly Bish will turn -- or would have turned -- 17. Magi Bish said she was thinking about inviting some of Molly's friends over for cake and asking them to do a good deed or act extra-safely in Molly's name.</p>
        <p>''We need to be Molly's voice until we find her, and we have to find her,'' Mrs. Bish said. ''She brings joy to our house. She's our sunshine-silly goose.''</p>
