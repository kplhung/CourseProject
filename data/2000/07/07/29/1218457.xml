        <p>Darryl Strawberry's life -- a seemingly endless series of drug relapses, suspensions, injuries, cancer and comebacks on the baseball diamond -- took an unfortunate turn yesterday, when Strawberry said his colon cancer, first discovered and treated in 1998, had returned.</p>
        <p>Strawberry told a Florida television station yesterday that his cancer had recurred. He declined a request for an interview with The New York Times. Strawberry's wife, Charisse, said he would have more tests before undergoing treatment.</p>
        <p>''It's tough, but I think Darryl has a good attitude about it,'' she said in a telephone interview last night from the couple's home in Tampa, Fla. ''He's ready to attack this aggressively. That's what the doctors advised him to do. They told him he's young. He recovered from this the first time. He'll do it again.''</p>
        <p>In a prepared statement, the Yankees said Strawberry had undergone a CAT scan under the supervision of his doctor, John Lepook, that ''suggests the possibility that his colon cancer has spread to lymph nodes'' near his original tumor. Strawberry will undergo more tests early next week ''to further define the situation,'' the statement said. It remained unclear last night when the scan was performed and when Strawberry learned of the possible cancerous lymph nodes.</p>
        <p>Strawberry's announcement came as the former star had once again landed in trouble with law-enforcement authorities in Florida. Last February, Strawberry was suspended for a year from major league baseball for cocaine use, his third suspension for drug abuse in five years. In March, he checked himself into the Sobrenity, Inc., clinic in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
        <p>But sometime in the last six weeks, he abruptly left the clinic, after only three months of treatment, saying he needed to return to baseball to make money. He has been seen and photographed attending a local club, Trapeze II, where patrons pay membership fees to engage in casual sex with one another.</p>
        <p>This week, Sports Illustrated published a photograph of Strawberry with a bare-chested woman at the club.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, the former Yankee, Met, Giant and Dodger, is on probation after being arrested in April 1999 in Tampa, charged with possessing cocaine and soliciting an undercover police officer posing as a prostitute. As part of his probation, he must abstain from drugs and avoid establishments where alcohol is the main source of income.</p>
        <p>Strawberry was scheduled to meet with Florida corrections officials yesterday to explain his presence at the club. To reporters, he has denied that he is a member of the Trapeze club and has dismissed the Sports Illustrated report as ''garbage.''</p>
        <p>He has also maintained that he has been busy trying to negotiate a minor league contract with the Saints, an independent team in St. Paul. ''I needed to start making a living,'' Strawberry told The Daily News earlier this week.</p>
        <p>But his statements yesterday suggest that he may have had other reasons besides financial problems for checking himself out of the Sobrenity, Inc., clinic. He told a reporter from WFLA-TV in Tampa yesterday morning, ''I have some physical issues that I have to deal with that's more important right now.''</p>
        <p>Asked if his cancer had returned, Strawberry said, ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>Charisse Strawberry said her husband was in a peaceful mood despite the bad news. He has been encouraged, she said, by the comeback of Lance Armstrong, the cyclist who overcame testicular cancer and won the Tour de France twice. She also said he was still fighting his addictions to drugs and alcohol.</p>
        <p>''When you have two diseases, there are going to be relapses and recurrences,'' she said. ''Baseball is the farthest thing from our minds. Darryl's health is first.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing we can do about it,'' she added. ''We have three children. We have to deal with this.''</p>
        <p>Strawberry underwent colon surgery and began chemotherapy less than two years ago, in October 1998, as his teammates were winning the World Series. He went to spring training in February 1999, hoping for a quick comeback. But the Yankees decided that he was not strong enough after his treatment to play by opening day. He was left behind in Tampa to continue working out, but on April 14, the police in Tampa arrested him for soliciting sex from an undercover officer posing as a prostitute. They also found less than a gram of cocaine in his wallet. He pleaded no contest in court. Commissioner Bud Selig suspended him from baseball for 120 days and a Florida judge sentenced him to 18 months probation.</p>
        <p>Though he eventually returned to the Yankees and played in the 1999 World Series, Strawberry apparently could not resist the lure of cocaine. In January, he tested positive for cocaine during a periodic test administrated by Major League Baseball. Selig again suspended him, this time for a full year, and Strawberry forfeited his $750,000 salary.</p>
        <p>His former Yankee teammates, who were in Minneapolis to play the Twins last night, reacted with shock and sadness to the news that their colleague might be facing a second round of cancer treatments.</p>
        <p>''He had just gotten over cancer, and what can you say?'' Derek Jeter said. ''It's so unfortunate, and I don't know what else to say.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' manager, Joe Torre, who was treated for prostate cancer last year, said: ''It's very sad. Thank God there's so many more ways to treat cancer today. He's going to have a tough time, but hopefully, he'll get it taken care of.''</p>
