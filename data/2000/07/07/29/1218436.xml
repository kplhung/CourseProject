        <p>Recent incident at Kennedy International Airport, in which gun-wielding man was able to board National Airlines plane and hold pilot and co-pilot hostage, underscores what airline security officials have long acknowledged: security checkpoints are meant to do only part of job of preventing weapons from getting anywhere near airplanes; they say unarmed security officers at checkpoints are unable to stop armed person, and they are not supposed to; officials at Kennedy Airport say their security procedures worked as they should have: armed police officers responded in less than three minutes, no shots were fired, and hostage negotiators succeeded in persuading gunman to give himself up; many passengers boarding National Airlines jet say they felt shockingly vulnerable; note that checkpoint for National Airlines flight, unlike those throughout most of rest of airport, was unusually close to door to jetway, meaning flight attendants had little time to close door and prevent man from boarding; man has been identified as Aaron A Commey; diagrams (M)</p>

        <p>Airport security checkpoints, with their squads of guards and phalanxes of metal detectors, are considered by many passengers to be a kind of firewall, designed to stop weapons from getting anywhere near airplanes.</p>
        <p>But airline security officials have long acknowledged that the checkpoints are really meant to do only part of that job: they are supposed to detect hidden guns or bombs and provide a system for alerting armed police officers. If someone brandishes a gun and tries to force his way past, the officials said, the unarmed security officers at the checkpoints are not only unable to stop him, they are not supposed to.</p>
        <p>This fact was frighteningly underscored Thursday night in Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport when the police said Aaron A. Commey, 22, of Milwaukee, approached a security supervisor, waved a 10-millimeter automatic pistol, ran around the metal detectors and dashed out an elevated jetway at Gate 33. He then boarded a National Airlines Boeing 757 set to fly to Las Vegas and took the pilot and co-pilot hostage, officials said.</p>
        <p>No one was hurt during the takeover. Mr. Commey, who the police said surrendered peacefully, was arraigned yesterday on charges of attempted air piracy. Officials at Kennedy Airport insisted yesterday that their security procedures had worked as they should have: armed police officers responded in less than three minutes, as required by law; no shots were fired; hostage negotiators succeeded in persuading the gunman to give himself up.</p>
        <p>But to many of the passengers who were boarding the National Airlines jet, the security system seemed to have left them shockingly vulnerable. Unlike the security checkpoints throughout most of the rest of the airport, the checkpoint for the National Airlines flight was unusually close to the door to the jetway, meaning that there was next to no time for flight attendants to close the door and prevent him from boarding.</p>
        <p>''Police came very fast, but there was no security,'' said Marcus Weiss, a passenger interviewed shortly after the takeover began. ''The guy just walked right on through. It's really, really strange. The airport security working there weren't armed. They couldn't do anything.''</p>
        <p>Kennedy Airport officials and many other airline security experts said yesterday that the proximity of the checkpoint to the gate probably had little to do with what happened, because Mr. Commey, pointing a gun, probably could have gone through many other checkpoints farther from gates and still made his way onto a plane.</p>
        <p>But the officials agreed yesterday that the incident was exactly the kind that has long been considered virtually unpreventable.</p>
        <p>For six years, beginning in 1973 after a spate of hijackings, security screening points were set up in all the country's airports and they were guarded by armed police officers. But in 1978, the Federal Aviation Administration and the airline industry agreed to end the practice, in part because they considered it more dangerous than the possibility of a gunman's forcing his way through the checkpoint area.</p>
        <p>''It's not a firing range,'' said Homer A. Boynton, who directed security for American Airlines from 1981 to 1993. ''There was a unanimous decision among the people in the airline industry and the people in the F.A.A. that it was a wise choice to take the armed guard away.''</p>
        <p>John Torres, the operations captain at Kennedy Airport, said that he believed people could have been hurt if guards had been armed or had tried to stop Mr. Commey.</p>
        <p>''There is a potential for a shootout in a crowded terminal with passengers walking around,'' said Captain Torres, one of the Port Authority police officers who directed the response to the hostage situation Thursday night. He added: ''Security did the right thing. They did not try to take an individual.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Port Authority officials said, the security guards -- who do not work for the Port Authority but for a private company under contract to the airlines -- pushed what is known as a covert button as soon as Mr. Commey sprinted past the metal detectors.</p>
        <p>The button sounded an alarm that summoned armed Port Authority police officers. Al Graser, deputy director of the aviation department for the Port Authority, said that at least one officer is stationed in each of the six terminals at Kennedy Airport.</p>
        <p>Under federal law, officers once were required to respond to a security checkpoint within one minute in an emergency, but over the years, as the number of hijacking attempts dropped, the requirement was relaxed to five minutes, Mr. Graser said.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Captain Torres said, the police response time was two to three minutes.</p>
        <p>Cathal L. Flynn, the head of civil aviation security for the F.A.A., also praised the job done not only by police and security officers, but also by the flight attendants and pilots, who he said managed to deal with the situation calmly.</p>
        <p>Despite that assessment, the incident is likely to raise troubling questions once again about the effectiveness of the private security systems in place at Kennedy and all the nation's airports.</p>
        <p>The checkpoints detect an average of 2,000 weapons each year and have been remarkably successful in preventing the hijackings that plagued the industry in the early 1970's, Mr. Flynn said.</p>
        <p>But the performance of the guards has been a longstanding concern of federal watchdog agencies. In a report released late last month, the General Accounting Office concluded that a variety of problems had continued to affect guards' ability to detect dangerous objects carried by passengers. Although the F.A.A. does not release the results of tests of security systems, the G.A.O. said that Federal Aviation Administration officials had acknowledged that their own tests of guards and checkpoints had shown that they did not work satisfactorily in detecting dangerous objects.</p>
        <p>In its report, the G.A.O. said the problems were attributable mostly to a difficult working environment and rapid turnover among security personnel at many airports. ''Screeners are often paid the minimum wage or close to it and can often earn more at airport fast-food restaurants,'' the investigators wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flynn said the F.A.A. had begun to carry out changes to improve the screening systems, including installing better detection equipment and creating computer surveillance programs that would record the security officers' attentiveness and performance.</p>
        <p>''We need to improve the human element; we don't disagree,'' Mr. Flynn said. But he also pointed out that no one had been killed during a terrorist incident on a flight originating in the United States, and attributed that to a successful overall security effort.</p>
        <p>Kennedy Airport officials also said that the incident Thursday night was the only takeover of a plane there in recent memory.</p>
        <p>According to information from the F.A.A., there were no hijackings of a flight originating in the United States between 1992 and 1998, the last year statistics were available. In January 1999, the police charged an unarmed man with threatening to start killing people on a Boeing 737 Southwest Airlines jet departing from Los Angeles unless it was diverted to Burbank, Calif., The Associated Press reported. He was arrested after a brief struggle with the police when the plane landed.</p>
        <p>Airport security experts said that it was unrealistic to think that incidents like that one or like Thursday's at Kennedy Airport could be entirely avoided. Captain Torres, of the Port Authority police, said that the airport security guards did all they could.</p>
        <p>''This is an argument we can't win,'' he said. ''The answer is not let's arm the people at the security points, because you would have a shootout.''</p>
