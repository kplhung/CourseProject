        <p>It was an anxious, gray morning and Sammy Abbassi shifted slightly in the maroon metal bleachers at the College of Staten Island, listening while coaches and scouts from the Yankees described what they were looking for in a player.

        <p>It was an anxious, gray morning and Sammy Abbassi shifted slightly in the maroon metal bleachers at the College of Staten Island, listening while coaches and scouts from the Yankees described what they were looking for in a player. Abbassi prayed he would be among the players who were invited back for a second look by the World Series champions.</p>
        <p>About 40 other players sitting all around Abbassi were just as hopeful and just as nervous. The players, who all wore different uniforms, resembled baseball nomads. There were orange Orioles, red Devils, blue Dodgers and black Cadets trying to get noticed, but there were no pinstriped Yankees. No players were presumptive enough to wear a Yankees uniform to a Yankees tryout camp.</p>
        <p>The Yankees held their first of five invitation-only workouts for college and high school players from the five boroughs yesterday, searching for one player, but probably not two, who somehow slipped through the thin cracks of baseball's vast scouting system.</p>
        <p>''I've had people tell me that I should go on with my life and grow up,'' said the 22-year-old Abbassi, who played baseball at Long Island University in Brooklyn before graduating last year. ''I've got 75 years to grow up. With this, I've got the chance to play minor league baseball for the Yankees. Who hasn't dreamed of doing that?''</p>
        <p>Every major league team routinely holds tryout camps, but this one is unusual because it focuses on different boroughs each day and extends across six days. The players were mostly from Manhattan yesterday. They will be mostly from the Bronx today, Staten Island on Monday, and Queens and Brooklyn on Tuesday. The three dozen or so of the 150 players who have survived will return for a final workout on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>When Stan Getzler, who owns the Class A Staten Island Yankees, was trying to secure a temporary home for his team, he told Mark Newman, the vice president for baseball operations for the New York Yankees, that he wanted to hold tryouts exclusively for players from the New York metropolitan area. Newman felt it was an excellent idea because ''it's a nice, easy way to look at a lot of players.''</p>
        <p>While Getzler, 71, did not know if the Yankees would sign even one player, or if the prospect would wind up playing for Staten Island, his idea had been brewing for more than 50 years. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science, Getzler hoped to play baseball at New York University, but the coach refused to even let Getzler try out because he had not played in high school. The snub stayed with Getzler for half a century.</p>
        <p>''I guess I hid that in the back of my mind,'' Getzler said. ''Kids from the streets of New York deserve a chance.''</p>
        <p>The position players basically had one 60-yard dash, eight swings and four throws from their respective positions to impress the Yankees, while the pitchers needed to prove they had a sturdy fastball.</p>
        <p>It is a small sample, but Joe Arnold, the Staten Island manager and an area scout for the Yankees, Nick Jiavaras and Cesar Presbott displayed adept coaching touches. They knew when extra swings or extra throws were needed to cement certain appraisals.</p>
        <p>''We get one day,'' Abbassi said. ''But there are thousands of guys out there who would take it.''</p>
        <p>Arnold, who watched only three hands pop up when he asked if the players had ever used wooden bats, was realistic about the talent search. ''It's a lot for P.R.,'' Arnold said. ''I hate to say that. We're also giving the kids a chance. It's legit. You never know what you're going to find.''</p>
        <p>Newman called this camp ''prospecting in the purest form'' and spoke about the advantages of having a lengthy tryout because New York is densely populated and players are constantly overlooked. Still, Newman said the Yankees might ''not find anybody or we may find one'' player.</p>
        <p>The Yankees liked Bernie Casada immediately. After the players stretched near the right-field line, the Yankees lined them up in pairs to run the 60-yard dash along the warning track. When Casada ran, he looked as if he was wearing inline skates instead of cleats. The Yankees quickly underlined his name.</p>
        <p>Casada played at James Monroe High School four years ago, but he never earned his diploma so no colleges recruited him. A 20-year-old native of the Dominican Republic, Casada looked more like a player than anyone else, from his smooth fielding to his tremendous speed to his slick wristbands.</p>
        <p>''This is a big chance,'' Casada said. ''They've given me a big chance.''</p>
        <p>They also liked Abbassi. He was the oldest player on the field yesterday and it was obvious. While some players feebly flicked pop-ups, Abbassi socked four rockets to the warning track. If the balls were new, instead of dingy and soggy, Abbassi might have knocked four homers. Abbassi also displayed a powerful arm from right field, firing bullets to third base.</p>
        <p>''This is my last chance,'' said Abbassi, an L.I.U. graduate student who is studying to become an athletic trainer. ''This is a last resort.''</p>
        <p>After the two-hour workout, the players sat in the bleachers again to hear who had survived. The sun beat into Abbassi's eyes when Presbott held up a paper with 10 names on it. Abbassi waited, but not for long; the first name Presbott read was Abbassi's. Casada's wasn't far behind. Abbassi lowered his head and exhaled because his dream, however fleeting, was still alive.</p>
