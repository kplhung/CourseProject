        <p>A federal  judge here sentenced New York  Apple Tours  whose red double-decker buses have become a fixture and a target for criticism in  New York City -- to the maximum penalty of five years' probation and an $800,000 fine today for lying on import documents in an attempt to evade federal emissions standards for the buses.</p>
        <p>The judge, John W. Bissell of United States District Court, also rebuked the company, which had pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, for delays in remedying the evasion. He ordered it to meet immediately with federal Environmental Protection Administration officials to determine what it must do to rebuild the engines and retrofit the British-built buses to meet the emissions standards.</p>
        <p>The president of the company, Hayim Grant, who appeared here  in court, said later that he did not know how much it would cost to rebuild the engines on its 32 buses  still plying tour routes in the city, but that for now the buses would continue to roll.</p>
        <p>''It's a big question,'' he said of the price, which he estimated to be up to $12,000 per engine, plus the cost of engineering work to determine whether the engines can be adapted to the buses. ''We are not sure what the effect will be. But we will do whatever E.P.A. wants us to do.''</p>
        <p>The long-term fate of the company, which was once based in Fort Lee, N.J., and is now based in Manhattan, depends not only on its ability to meet the federal emission standards, but also on continuing moves by both New York City and New York State to strip the company of its operating licenses. Those efforts intensified in May after one of the company's buses struck and killed a pedestrian, Randolph Walker, 71, in a Midtown intersection.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles said today that the agency would resume its efforts to suspend the company's vehicle registrations on Aug. 21 in continuing hearings before an administrative law judge.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a statement that the city would continue to pursue its efforts to revoke the company's operating license, issued by the Department of Consumer Affairs. He cited Judge Bissell's ruling as an indication of ''New York Apple's continuing lack of fitness'' to do business.</p>
        <p>Today's sentencing was the latest blemish on a company that in nearly a decade of operations has paid thousands of dollars in fines, raised the ire of Manhattan residents who say their neighborhoods are besieged by the behemoth buses, and prompted city regulators to  oust the company's founder, Harry Grant, as president.</p>
        <p>The company pleaded guilty to the federal charges in January. But it was the death of Mr. Walker that  spurred the city and the state to  close the company's operations with a flurry of actions in June. A  State Supreme Court justice later reversed those actions as a violation of due process, and named a monitor to oversee the company's daily operations and install auditing mechanisms.</p>
        <p>The monitor, Ross Sandler, said today that since his appointment the company had operated in compliance with state requirements, had received 23 minor summonses and had five minor accidents, which resulted in no injuries but led to the firings of two drivers.</p>
        <p>Walter Timpone, the lawyer for Apple Tours, said today in court that the official efforts against the company after Mr. Walker's death were ''rabid,'' and that the atmosphere surrounding them was ''hysterical.'' He said he hoped the court would not be influenced by ''what went on across the river.''</p>
        <p>Judge Bissell said he was not, but added that he had some concerns of his own growing out of the federal case.</p>
        <p>As he prepared to sentence the company, the judge chided it for interpreting its own plea agreement in a way that suggested yet another evasion of the law.</p>
        <p>The company pleaded guilty to falsely claiming that buses and engines that it imported into the country were built before 1967 and therefore exempt from federal emissions requirements. As a remedy, the company replaced those engines with older ones which were truly exempt -- rather than rebuilding the existing engines to meet emissions standards.</p>
        <p>Judge Bissell said that the company's interpretation of the plea deal was ''at best a subjective view'' and ''at worst an after-the-fact construction,'' adding that the company must take the more costly route of rebuilding and retrofitting the engines to comply with emission standards at the time of the original importation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timpone, the company's lawyer, noted that the judge had turned down a request by the prosecutor, Assistant United States Attorney Lorraine Gerson, that the judge set a strict schedule for the rebuilding of the bus engines.</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, there was no immediate need to pull the buses from their tour routes.</p>
        <p>Under the payment schedule for the fine, the company paid $50,000 today as the first installment and must pay $107,142 on Nov. 1 of this year and each of the next six years.</p>
