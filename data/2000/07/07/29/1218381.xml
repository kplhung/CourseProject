        <p>With electricity prices soaring in San Diego, and consumer anger rising even faster, California politicians are backing away from the state's ambitious plan to deregulate its power industry fully by 2002.</p>
        <p>The fight in California, which four years ago led what has become a national movement to deregulate the electric industry, is likely to presage a debate across the country over whether deregulation is working, politicians here say.</p>
        <p>''It's a nationwide problem,'' said State Senator Steve Peace, a San Diego Democrat who helped write the deregulation legislation but is now calling for some government controls on prices.</p>
        <p>High demand and tight supplies have given too much market power to a few generators and power marketers, causing prices to spike unreasonably, Mr. Peace said.</p>
        <p>''The market can either prove that it's disciplined enough and stable enough to address its problem,'' he said, ''or, inevitably, whether it's the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do, the political system will cut them off at the pass.''</p>
        <p>That view gained momentum on Thursday, when Gov. Gray Davis asked the federal government to impose controls on the wholesale price of electricity across the West. Residential consumers and businesses need relief from price spikes that caused the average monthly electric bill in San Diego to more than double in June, the governor said.</p>
        <p>''When California deregulated the electricity market in 1996,'' Mr. Davis said, ''consumers were promised that competition in the marketplace would be mature enough to ensure stable, if not reduced, prices. That is clearly not the case in California.''</p>
        <p>Big swings in the wholesale price of electricity are not unusual in the summer, when high demand taxes generators' ability to supply power. In New England, the wholesale cost of power reached more than 100 times its usual level for a few hours during an unexpected heat wave this May. But because of regulation, consumers and businesses have always been insulated from the swings, paying one price for electricity year-round, regardless of its true cost.</p>
        <p>Now, as California makes the complex transition from a regulated to a competitive market, San Diego has become the first market in the nation where consumers must pay retail prices that move with the true wholesale price as it changes from month to month. And they are not happy.</p>
        <p>''San Diego in many ways is the poster child for how not to do deregulation,'' said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 42,000-member group based in San Diego, where the average monthly residential bill rose in June to more than $100, from about $50.</p>
        <p>But power companies and many economists argue that price controls are a misguided and shortsighted measure that will only increase the risk of blackouts in both the short run and the long. Price caps failed on both natural gas and gasoline, and they will fail on electricity, said William Hogan, a professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who has studied deregulation and worked as a consultant for utilities.</p>
        <p>''We used to have lots of shortages of natural gas; now we have lots of natural gas,'' Professor Hogan said. ''The reason we had shortages is we had price controls. That's what electricity is facing now.''</p>
        <p>Nationally, independent power generators are moving quickly to add new plants to bring supply and demand back into line, said Jeffrey K. Skilling, president of the Enron Corporation, a Houston company that is the world's leading trader of electricity and natural gas.</p>
        <p>''Let the market do its thing,'' Mr. Skilling said. ''The system is tight around the country, but there's been an enormous supply response.''</p>
