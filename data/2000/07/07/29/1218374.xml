        <p>Are you in despair over the hateful state of rock? Buck up, music consumers. This summer offers plenty of chances to vote with your dollar against homophobic and sexist rock artists and for earnest, love-struck alternative rockers!</p>
        <p>These cuties seem at least to like, if not understand, both women and their own softer sides. They bang out the shimmering, scarless guitar sound radio programmers love, creating ideal settings for ear-catchingly anthemic choruses. Sure, their hits sound exasperatingly familiar. But really, kind shopper -- did you buy that Nokia phone because it was different? No! You bought it because it gets the job done. And when it comes to mainstream rock, the job is turning even the worst mood into a feel-good singalong.</p>

        <p>Are you in despair over the hateful state of rock? Buck up, music consumers. This summer offers plenty of chances to vote with your dollar against homophobic and sexist rock artists and for earnest, love-struck alternative rockers!</p>
        <p>These cuties seem at least to like, if not understand, both women and their own softer sides. They bang out the shimmering, scarless guitar sound radio programmers love, creating ideal settings for ear-catchingly anthemic choruses. Sure, their hits sound exasperatingly familiar. But really, kind shopper -- did you buy that Nokia phone because it was different? No! You bought it because it gets the job done. And when it comes to mainstream rock, the job is turning even the worst mood into a feel-good singalong.</p>
        <p>Seriously, folks. It's foolish to condemn popular music when bands expressing sensitivity and even defenselessness in the face of love continue to capture the public's fancy. Consider these environmentally (and emotionally) sound options.</p>
        <p>Vertical Horizon</p>
        <p>Matt Scannell and Keith Kane, the founders of this fervent quartet, are so upstanding that they graduated from Georgetown before becoming professional musicians. After three independent albums, this hard-working band hit with ''Everything You Want'' (RCA/BMG), whose title track has been the top single in the nation for weeks on end.</p>
        <p>What finally clicked? A song that amounts to a long crescendo, energized by strummed guitars and Mr. Scannell's reverberant shouting, expressing utter hopelessness. ''Everything You Want'' is about a woman who just does not care about Mr. Scannell, and no amount of yodeling will get her attention. The futility of his passion captivates.</p>
        <p>Vertical Horizon lends similar grandeur to resentment and despair throughout this album. Nothing matches the exquisite masochism of ''Everything You Want,'' but the band's next single, ''You're a God,'' takes the belief in one's own insignificance into the cosmic sphere. Vertical Horizon will play tonight at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., opening for Third Eye Blind.</p>
        <p>Nine Days</p>
        <p>The Long Island combo Nine Days, which will play at Irving Plaza on Monday, mixes the bratty tone of pop-punk with the more adult ambition of Everclear in ''The Madding Crowd'' (Epic/550 Music). Its big single, ''Absolutely (Story of a Girl),'' considers heartbreak from the point of view of the klutz who did the damage. John Hampson, who wrote the frisky hit, takes the blame for negligence and in a chorus defends romantic harmony: ''I absolutely love her when she smiles,'' he sings of his sweetheart.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere on ''Madding Crowd,'' Mr. Hampson's co-writer, Brian Desveaux, whose raspy croon is more distinctive than his partner's, risks banality all too often. The 1970's revival may never die, but no songwriter should base a ballad on the phrase, ''If you love someone, set them free.'' Still, Mr. Desveaux's paean to his idol, ''Bob Dylan,'' wittily incorporates samples from the craggy icon.</p>
        <p>The album's second-best cut is another one by Mr. Hampson, and it's even more female-friendly than ''Absolutely.'' He declares his intention to grow up in ''Revolve,'' singing, ''I will continue to evolve, I will continue to revolve around your sun.'' How many rocker boys will make a vow like that?</p>
        <p>3 Doors Down</p>
        <p>Altogether gloomier than its chart-topping counterparts, ''The Better Life'' (Republic/Universal) by the Mississippi band 3 Doors Down is in the post-grunge vein currently being sucked dry by the God-fearing Florida band Creed. In fact, 3 Doors Down is touring with Creed and will play Madison Square Garden with the band on Aug. 28.</p>
        <p>Rock radio listeners already know the group from ''Kryptonite,'' hardly the only rock song to play with the notion of Superman as a weakling, but maybe the first one to imply that something good comes from clinging to that shortcoming. The lyrics by the drummer and singer Brad Arnold are a bit obtuse, but he seems to compare his girlfriend to kryptonite, the stuff that makes the man of steel melt. As his martial drumbeat keeps him in line and the twin guitars of Matt Roberts and Chris Henderson fortify him, the manly-voiced Mr. Arnold declares loyalty to a less than perfect mate.</p>
        <p>''The Better Life'' welcomes many tests of will. Mr. Arnold sees danger in addicted friends, self-destructive lovers and his own depression. But as the somber, invigorating crunch of the music elevates him, he grits his teeth and transcends.</p>
        <p>Such righteous rock (with a hint of Christian sentiment) is a powerful force in today's scene. With bands like this offering alternatives to the mayhem-inducing Slipknot, protest against popular music seems pointless. These artists prove nice rock 'n' roll will never die.</p>
