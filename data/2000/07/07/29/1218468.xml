        <p>Letter from Pierre E Biscaye comments on William Sorensen's paeon to sleep, particularly during vacation (July 25 Op-Ed)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I differ with William Sorensen and his family's adulation of the pleasure of sleep (''Maybe Not Tanned, but Rested,'' Op-Ed, July 25). True, a comfortable bed and pillow, just the right amount of covers for the temperature, quiet surroundings without the possibility of being jangled upright by a telephone -- these are to be desired.</p>
        <p>It is not, however, sleeping that I enjoy; it is the pleasure of going to sleep -- the sensation of those minutes of utter relaxation, drowsiness and abandon to the arms of Morpheus -- that is so enjoyable, and, unlike sleeping itself, memorable.</p>

        <p>I differ with William Sorensen and his family's adulation of the pleasure of sleep (''Maybe Not Tanned, but Rested,'' Op-Ed, July 25). True, a comfortable bed and pillow, just the right amount of covers for the temperature, quiet surroundings without the possibility of being jangled upright by a telephone -- these are to be desired.</p>
        <p>It is not, however, sleeping that I enjoy; it is the pleasure of going to sleep -- the sensation of those minutes of utter relaxation, drowsiness and abandon to the arms of Morpheus -- that is so enjoyable, and, unlike sleeping itself, memorable.</p>
        <p>At my age, I can enjoy the physical and mental pleasures of travel to the Land of Nod twice or even more times per night. In addition, for those nights in which sleep doesn't return immediately, and I arise to read or work for two or three hours, there is the anticipation of drifting off for an afternoon siesta to look forward to.</p>
