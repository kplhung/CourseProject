        <p>State auditors in Wisconsin said yesterday that Maximus Inc., the nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work programs, had billed Wisconsin for $466,000 since 1997 in improper or questionable expenses, including more than 300 hours that its employees spent seeking contracts in New York City.</p>
        <p>Maximus, based in McLean, Va., has come under sharp criticism for its business practices in recent months, and a state judge in Manhattan has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award it more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find work.</p>
        <p>While Maximus officials said that many of the charges in Wisconsin were justified, they added that the company had repaid about $190,000 for expenditures that the state's auditors considered improper. Some of this money was used for holiday parties and concerts, including an appearance by the singer Melba Moore.</p>
        <p>Janice Mueller, the Wisconsin state auditor, said the state and the company would negotiate over other possible repayments. According to a report released yesterday, Ms. Mueller and her auditors found $276,000 in additional charges that might have been excessive or were poorly documented.</p>
        <p>The company's problems in Wisconsin have broader significance because it still hopes to win the New York contracts. The Giuliani administration has appealed the judge's ruling in April that the bid process was corrupted because Maximus had early access to officials developing the program.</p>
        <p>The administration asked the judge to rule on the issue because the city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, refused to approve the contracts. Referring to the Wisconsin audit, Mr. Hevesi said yesterday: ''The evidence continues to pile up that Maximus is not a responsible contractor. This is just one more example.''</p>
        <p>Rachael Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus, said the company believed most of the Wisconsin charges were legitimate. She said the company had mistakenly billed Wisconsin for $51,000 in wages for time that its employees spent seeking contracts in New York and five other states, but said it was included in the $190,000 that had been repaid. But she said Maximus repaid the rest as ''a good-faith effort.''</p>
        <p>She said some of these expenditures were ''examples of our innovative, out-of-the-box approach'' to helping welfare recipients shift into the work force. The auditors, for instance, disallowed a $23,000 payment to Ms. Moore, who gave a motivational speech and performed in concert for former welfare recipients. Ms. Rowland said the singer had once been on welfare herself and helped encourage some of the job seekers.</p>
        <p>But the auditors also rejected more than $15,000 in expenditures for holiday parties and social events for Maximus employees and questioned $22,000 in restaurant charges and $1,500 for flowers. The auditors noted that Maximus spent $196,000 on types of advertising, including mugs and backpacks with the company's name, that ''appear to have been more promotional than informational.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rowland said some of the meals were served to former welfare recipients, and she said the advertising was needed to increase the company's visibility in Wisconsin.</p>
