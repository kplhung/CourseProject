        <p>France's transportation minister said today that evidence so far pointed to a burst tire as the root cause of the fire that engulfed the left side of the Air France Concorde that crashed shortly after take off on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, issued a statement late today that said he had just been apprised of the latest findings by investigators looking into why the supersonic jet lost power and slammed into a small, wooden hotel on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
        <p>''From the information available at present to this body,'' Mr. Gayssot said, ''it emerges that at least one tire burst, something that could have triggered a chain of events, damage to the plane's structure, a fire and engine failure.''</p>
        <p>The minister's statement came shortly after investigators from the French crash investigation agency confirmed that at least one tire on the left side of the plane had burst when it was still on the runway. On Thursday, French investigators said in a statement that pieces of tire had been found on the runway.</p>
        <p>But the investigators also seemed to play down  any notion that the tire fragments had been sucked into the engines and had caused the fire.</p>
        <p>The investigators said all the runway debris identified so far came from parts of the aircraft other than the engines, suggesting that the fire had begun elsewhere. They said they could not yet be certain where the fire originated.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, French investigators said in a statement that the plane had trouble with both engines on the left side of the aircraft. Crew members reported to the control tower that one engine had failed and that they could not raise the landing gear upon takeoff. But flight recorders indicate that the second engine on the left side lost power briefly on takeoff. Less than a minute later it lost power again. Then the plane, failing to gain speed or altitude, banked sharply left and crashed.</p>
        <p>In the past, burst tires and wheel fragments have caused a wide range of damage to Concordes. During one 1979 incident at Dulles International Airport near Washington, tire debris and wheel shrapnel damaged an engine, punctured three fuel tanks and severed several hydraulic lines and electrical wires. A large hole was also torn in the top wing skin.</p>
        <p>But in that case, the plane, leaking fuel, was able to return to the airport and land safely.</p>
        <p>Experts, however, say that flight could easily have ended in disaster. ''There is some luck involved in such things, '' said Patrick Augin, a pilot and the vice president of France's largest pilots' union, the Syndicat National de Pilotes de Ligne. ''It did not cause a fire in 1979, but it could have. Exactly where the holes occur can make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Reviewing the 1979 incident, the National Transportation Safety Board said the Concorde's problems with burst tires were ''potentially catastrophic.'' The sleek needle-nosed Concordes are particularly hard on landing gear. Their ''V'' shape wings produce less lift, and so the plane must fly faster on takeoff and landing compared with other aircraft. High-speed takeoffs and landings heat up tires. The safety board referred specifically to the possibility of tire shrapnel touching off a fire or explosion.</p>
        <p>At the time, the board praised Air France for maintaining maximum mechanical safety and for quickly taking the measures that it recommended. It wanted pilots to keep their landing gear extended after a blowout, partly to ensure that the damaged gear did not get stuck when it was retracted. But the board was also concerned that a wheel rim or other damaged part, hot from friction with the runway, would not come near leaking, flammable fluids close to where the wheels are stowed.</p>
        <p>In addition to changing the crew procedures, the airline installed a ''flat tire detection system'' that was to inform the crew if a blowout occurred.</p>
        <p>The latest information from the French ministry appears to rule out early speculation that the accident was related to last-minute repair work on the reverse thrusters of the plane's No. 2 engine. The day after the crash, the prosecutor conducting France's judicial inquiry into whether the crash involved negligence suggested that the fire began in the No. 2 engine. At the time, members of the technical inquiry said such a conclusion was premature.</p>
        <p>As investigators continued to examine the debris today, officials also reported that the toll from the accident had risen by one. At the crash site in the working-class suburb of Gonesse, firefighters discovered another victim, bringing the number of dead to 114 people: 100 passengers, 9 crew members and 5 people on the ground.</p>
        <p>The additional victim was in the hotel at the time of the crash and has not been identified, the officials said. Most passengers were German tourists flying to New York to board a cruise ship. The lone American on the flight was identified today as Christopher Behrens, a retired sales and promotion executive for Air France, according to The Associated Press. He lived alone in Germany and had no children.</p>
        <p>Still in shock over the crash, hundreds of Gonesse residents gathered for their own memorial ceremony, a silent march from the town's City Hall to the singed field where Air France Flight 4590 crashed, destroying the Hotelissimo.</p>
        <p>Led by the mayor and the manager of the hotel, many mourners held a single rose and said they had come to pay their respects to the victims.</p>
        <p>Air France also held a ceremony for its own with hundreds of employees gathering in the courtyard at the company headquarters to hear personal tributes to the plane's crew members.</p>
