        <p>U.S. May Move Embassy In Effort to Aid Barak  President Clinton, acting to help shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's shaky political base, went on Israeli television and promised concrete rewards for peace, hinting that he was ready to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem. The move would be a triumph for Jews around the world who have long sought international recognition for Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>

        <p>Disagreement on Crash Cause  France's transportation minister said that evidence so far pointed to a burst tire as the cause of the fire that engulfed the left side of the Air France Concorde that crashed shortly after takeoff on Tuesday. But investigators seemed to play down any notion that tire fragments had been sucked into the engines and had caused the fire.</p>

        <p>Racism Suspected in Bombing  German police and prosecutors said that the nine people injured by a bomb on Thursday in Dusseldorf, including six Jews, were immigrants. An official said it was reasonable to assume that the attackers had a racist motive, but the police said other possible motives, including reports of a feud among the immigrants, remained under examination.</p>

        <p>Putin Meets with Tycoons  President Vladimir V. Putin convened a meeting at the Kremlin with Russian tycoons, and after the session business leaders said they were prepared to abide by government rules if the Kremlin would create a fairer business climate. In return, they said they had won Mr. Putin's assurance that they could hold on to their wealth gained during the post-Soviet privatizations.</p>

        <p>Riots as Fujimori Sworn In  President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru was inaugurated for a third term as waves of demonstrators, driven by a belief that he was elected in a fraudulent vote, tried to interrupt the proceedings, only to be turned back by the police. Two people were reported to have died in fires set by protesters; about 100 people were injured.</p>

        <p>New Primary System Is Quashed by Bush Camp  Gov. George W. Bush ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding the Republican convention next week by killing an effort to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted. The Republican National Committee's plan was intended to lengthen the primary system by making the big states vote last. Members of the committee attributed the Bush camp's opposition to the plan to a desire to have a convention free of conflict.</p>

        <p>Republicans fought passionately over abortion at a meeting on the party platform, with the anti-abortion forces easily prevailing, as the platform committee made its way through a document intended to balance the party's core conservatism with Governor Bush's attempt at a more centrist appeal.</p>

        <p>Governor Bush flew into Arkansas, proclaiming that he intended to contest areas in President Clinton's home territory that the Democrats won solidly in the last two presidential elections. With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the northwest corner of Arkansas, Mr. Bush began a five-day march to the Republican National Convention that will take him through the battleground states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.</p>

        <p>I.R.S. Suspends Workers  The Internal Revenue Service has suspended at least eight Chicago-area workers in a criminal investigation into bribery and other offenses. Lawyers familiar with the case said a federal grand jury was expected to hand up indictments, in what would be the first major corruption case brought against a group of I.R.S. workers since Congress passed the I.R.S. Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.</p>

        <p>Electric Prices Rise in West  Gov. Gray Davis of California has asked the federal government to impose controls on the wholesale price of electricity across the West. The average monthly electric bill in San Diego more than doubled in June. California politicians are now backing away from the state's plan to deregulate its power industry fully by 2002.</p>

        <p>Armed Intruder Exposes Limits of Airport Security  The police identified Aaron Amartei Commey, a 22-year-old Bronx native who had been living in Milwaukee, as the gunman who commandeered a passenger jet at Kennedy International Airport on Thursday night, before surrendering. He was arraigned on charges of attempted air piracy. Officials said security procedures worked properly, but that checkpoints are only supposed to detect hidden weapons and provide a system for alerting armed officers, not stop someone from forcing his way past unarmed guards.</p>

        <p>West Side Burglar Beats Couple  A violent burglar who the police think may have plundered several Upper West Side homes beat a 50-year-old woman and a male companion with a flashlight, leaving the woman in critical condition, the police said. The attack, on West 87th Street near Riverside Drive, follows six similar cases in the area.</p>

        <p>Economy Continues to Grow  Despite a pullback in consumer spending, the American economy grew at a robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. A widely expected slowdown failed to materialize. But the second quarter offered just enough signs of weakness to raise doubts about the future of the nation's longest expansion.</p>

        <p>Stocks tumbled as the report of unexpectedly strong economic growth increased the threat of another Federal Reserve interest rate increase. The Nasdaq plunged 4.7 percent, finishing the week off 10.5 percent, its third worst week ever. The Dow fell 0.7 percent for the day.</p>
