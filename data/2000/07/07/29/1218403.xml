        <p>With just two stocks, two hours and $5,000 in trades, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam opened its first stock market for business today and took faltering steps into the uncertain world of free markets.</p>
        <p>Hopeful investors packed into the three brokerage offices taking orders for the shares this morning to watch the market's birth on electronic boards. But curiosity and excitement quickly turned into confusion and disappointment, when minutes before the Ho Chi Minh City Securities Trading Center opened, the government imposed a ceiling on bids that invalidated many people's orders -- some of which were more than 50 percent above the government's artificially imposed prices.</p>
        <p>Sellers were so scarce at those prices that by the end of the session, only 4,200 shares of the two companies had been traded, with a combined value of 70.4 million Vietnamese dong, or nearly $5,000.</p>
        <p>Market officials nevertheless declared the day a success, pointing to investors' interest and justifying their price intervention as necessary to protect novices. ''In the initial stages, the psychology of the market isn't stable,'' said Vu Bang, the director of the trading center.</p>
        <p>Foreign residents here called the opening of the market an important moment in Vietnam's development. ''The immediate point is symbolic,'' said Dominic Scriven, an expatriate businessman who has been investing in Vietnamese companies for nine years. ''The government now acknowledges the right of private ownership, the transfer of ownership, the right to make money.''</p>
        <p>Many hope that market trading will lure back some of the billions of dollars that Vietnamese have squirreled away -- out of government view -- and make that available for corporate expansion. ''The market might shake loose money from under mattresses,'' said Jonathan Waugh, chief representative in Vietnam of Jardine Fleming Securities.</p>
        <p>But they will first need to rekindle the confidence of today's disappointed investors. ''My order has just been destroyed,'' said Tran Van Thang, a 20-year-old finance student who had signed up to buy 100 shares of each traded stock, the Refrigeration Electrical Engineering Company and the Cables and Telecommunications Material Joint Stock Company, but at prices well above the government's maximum. Like many today, Mr. Thang came less to profit than to learn what trading stocks was all about. ''We don't have any books for this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Vietnam has been promising to open a stock market since 1992, which foreign investors here say is another illustration of the Communist country's halting movement toward the global economy. China and Russia opened stock markets more than a decade ago. Officials here say that they were busy planning.</p>
        <p>In their efforts to get it right, the Vietnamese borrowed expertise from Thailand and modeled the exchange on South Korea's and a more famous one on Wall Street; the exchange's deputy director, Tran Dac Sinh, visited the New York Stock Exchange last year.</p>
        <p>It is a long way, though, from Wall Street. Outside today, women in conical hats sold birds and boys played soccer barefoot in the street. Officials would not even call it a stock exchange. But more business is coming. Two additional stocks should be listed in the next two weeks, Mr. Bang, the trading center's director, said. Fifty other companies meet Vietnam's criteria for a listing, and there are more than 400 formerly state-owned enterprises that have been privatized since 1993. Nearly 6,000 remain in government hands.</p>
        <p>The Vietnamese are avid gamblers, and in the absence of an official market, company shares have been trading on the gray market for years. ''This isn't a market,'' complained one such trader, Le Hung, as he clutched a bag full of unlisted shares that he hoped to sell. ''The government is intervening.''</p>
        <p>It may be some time before Saigon, as this city is still known here, produces its own bulls and bears. Shares now are traded only three days a week, and prices can rise or fall no more than 5 percent a session.</p>
        <p>But the desire is there. ''I heard that in the U.S. you can buy stocks on the Web,'' said Trung Thi Han, as she watched the board, waiting to learn if her order had been executed. ''I wish we could do that here.''</p>
