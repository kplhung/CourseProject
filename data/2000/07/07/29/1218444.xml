        <p>There has been anticipation for the Giants' intrasquad scrimmage on Saturday because it will be the first live action for the rookie running back Ron Dayne. Dayne had better be ready. It appears he could be the only every down running back to see regular action.</p>
        <p>The second-year running back Joe Montgomery, who is technically the starter as Dayne serves a brief apprenticeship, missed today's practice to have his elevated blood pressure checked and to be examined extensively by the team's doctors. It was the second time this week that Montgomery missed a training camp practice because of his blood pressure.</p>

        <p>There has been anticipation for the Giants' intrasquad scrimmage on Saturday because it will be the first live action for the rookie running back Ron Dayne. Dayne had better be ready. It appears he could be the only every down running back to see regular action.</p>
        <p>The second-year running back Joe Montgomery, who is technically the starter as Dayne serves a brief apprenticeship, missed today's practice to have his elevated blood pressure checked and to be examined extensively by the team's doctors. It was the second time this week that Montgomery missed a training camp practice because of his blood pressure.</p>
        <p>Running back Sean Bennett, meanwhile, will miss the scrimmage because of a disk problem in his back. The third-string running back Omar Bacon has not been practicing because of a hamstring strain. Tiki Barber will be available, but he has been working mostly as a third-down and situational back.</p>
        <p>''Joe said he just hasn't been feeling well,'' Coach Jim Fassel said of Montgomery, who missed most of his rookie training camp and the 1999 regular season with injuries. ''And with his blood pressure up, they ran all kinds of tests on him, but he's fine. His blood pressure is up and I don't know what they're doing with him medically. He can scrimmage tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Fassel said the Giants' two Pro Bowlers, linebacker Jessie Armstead and defensive end Michael Strahan, would not participate in the scrimmage. Strahan did not practice today because of a sore back. The Giants have been trying to rest Armstead's knees.</p>
        <p>''Both those guys could go, but maybe it's not the smartest idea,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Aerial Attack Expected</p>
        <p>The Giants' lack of depth at running back could lead to a lot of passing plays in the 50-play scrimmage, which is scheduled for 2 p.m. on the campus of the State University at Albany. That could make Saturday a coming-out party for the Giants' third-round pick, wide receiver Ron Dixon. Because second-stringers play a lot in controlled scrimmages, Dixon, who has had a good camp, could be featured.</p>
        <p>Dixon, a surprise draft pick from Lambuth University, has looked smooth running his pass routes, has an infectious enthusiasm for the game and has caught everything thrown his way.</p>
        <p>''Ron has done a lot of things right and it's hard not to notice him out there,'' Coach Jim Fassel said. ''He's a little raw. But I think you can see the things we saw in him when we scouted him. He's not in awe of any of this at camp, and I like that, too.''</p>
        <p>Dixon has also been practicing returning kickoffs and punts. The Giants can use the help returning kickoffs with Bashir Levingston out after ankle surgery.</p>
        <p>Smile for the Camera</p>
        <p>The Giants' best-known players -- Jessie Armstead, Michael Strahan and cornerback Jason Sehorn -- have been getting a lot of television time lately, in cameo roles in cable-television series.</p>
        <p>Armstead played himself in an episode of the HBO series ''Arliss'' that was broadcast this week. Strahan and Sehorn played themselves in an episode of the Disney series ''The Jersey,'' which was rebroadcast this week.</p>
        <p>Armstead said he enjoyed the experience, but went through a bit of stage fright delivering his three or four lines.</p>
        <p>''I had three hours to memorize the script and I was in my trailer doing it in front of a mirror,'' Armstead said. ''I had it down. I was ready. But when they said, 'Action,' I froze. I said, 'Wait a minute, I've got to get my game face on.' And I did it on the next take.''</p>
        <p>Strahan also said he enjoyed his time in front of the camera.</p>
        <p>''I've even got my Screen Actors Guild card,'' Strahan said. But his pay was not quite the same as the $8 million a year he gets to play for the Giants. Asked about his acting salary, Strahan laughed. ''I'll buy a stamp with my next residual check,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sehorn, who shared most of his scenes with Strahan, has other connections to Hollywood. He is engaged to Angie Harmon of television's ''Law and Order.''</p>
        <p>Harmon attended today's Giants practice. There is a picnic for the wives, families and girlfriends of players and coaches on Saturday.</p>
