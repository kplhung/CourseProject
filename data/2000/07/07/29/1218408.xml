        <p>With the political conventions and the campaign trail beckoning, Democratic and Republican lawmakers left town this week uttering freshly coined slogans that they hope will help voters choose sides in the November election.</p>
        <p>The ideas behind the slogans, however, are anything but fresh; instead, they harken to the one age-old difference between Republicans and Democrats. Does America want to spend money, in this case part of the budget surplus, on tax cuts? Or does it want to spend it on programs, like lowering the cost of prescription drugs?</p>
        <p>Spun another way, the charges boil down to this: Democrats want to sink the taxpayers' money into the giant government money pit, yet again. Republicans want to line the pockets of the rich, yet again.</p>
        <p>''It's the classic policy fight,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. ''But instead of red ink, they are fighting over black ink.''</p>
        <p>With the House and Senate Democratic leaders by his side, President Clinton stood in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday and reminded voters of this fundamental distinction between the parties.</p>
        <p>''For the last year, the Republican majority has risked squandering our progress,'' said Mr. Clinton, who has threatened to veto most Republican tax-cutting measures. ''They have passed reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut, to drain away our hard-earned surplus and put us back in the red.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans, he added, ''are leaving town with a trunk full of unfinished business.''</p>
        <p>At about the same time, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, expressed incredulity at Democrats for their refusal to give taxpayers a break. After making the obligatory promise to use most of the surplus to protect Social Security and reduce the national debt, Mr. DeLay accused Mr. Clinton of hoarding the gold.</p>
        <p>''The president doesn't want to return the surplus to the people who earned it,'' Mr. DeLay said at a news conference. ''President Clinton would rather use the surplus for more Washington spending.''</p>
        <p>In truth, both sides have tiptoed toward the middle this year, a sign of election-year skittishness and a recognition that the other party's message could catch on.</p>
        <p>A number of House Democrats, eager to inoculate themselves on a popular issue, have voted for a series of Republican tax cuts in the House, while their leaders, including Mr. Clinton, have laid out their own, more limited proposals to cut taxes.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Republicans, pressured by the rank and file, have offered their own remedies to address the issues that Democrats view as their domain, namely lowering the price of prescription drugs for senior citizens and overhauling managed health care.</p>
        <p>All the while, Democrats continue a steady drumbeat about a ''do-nothing'' Congress to the chagrin of Republicans who use every opportunity to tout their tax-cutting bills, geared mostly to the elderly, married couples and middle- and upper-class taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Republicans do not seem too concerned that few of their bills are likely to become law this year because of presidential vetoes. In an election year, especially, it is the stance, not the results, that counts. A veto would allow them to pose the question: Imagine what would happen with a Republican in the White House?</p>
        <p>''I am looking in awe at these accomplishments the Republican Congress has been able to pass in the past few weeks,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said while grinning broadly at a send-off rally the day the Congress departed for its August break.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic leader, also said he was in awe, but for different reasons.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans today who claim great achievement have sent President Clinton only 78 bills this year,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''One out of 4 of those bills named post offices and buildings, not exactly the most important matters that are before us.''</p>
        <p>Democrats are not making it easy for Republicans, who they say have caved in to special-interest groups in drafting legislation on prescription drug prices, managed care and gun control. Yet the Democrats do not appear worried that they will look intransigent, something Republicans frequently accuse them of being.</p>
        <p>''They block votes,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, referring to Democrats in the Senate, which has had a much harder time than the House in passing bills this year. ''Shame on them. It's a price that will be very expensive for them in the end.''</p>
        <p>But it is not likely to get any easier for Mr. Craig and his party; September and October are typically not the best months for Republicans, because they must get down to the basic work of passing spending bills. To do that, they must wrangle with Mr. Clinton, who usually holds the upper hand in these negotiations.</p>
        <p>The swearing-in this week of Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, to replace the late Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, could change the dynamics of at least one bill when Congress returns: the managed-care legislation backed by Democrats. That bill fell one vote shy of passage the last time it came up, a few weeks ago. Democrats are sure to push for it again, aides said.</p>
