        <p>ZIMMERMAN-Douglas Alan. Of Rockleigh, NJ, on July 27th. Beloved husband of Gail. Devoted father of Alexandra, Lindsay and Rebecca. Dear brother of Alana Sherman, Beth Zimmerman and Dorothy Eckert. Dear brother-inlaw of Mark Sherman. Cousin of Larry and Jack Needleman. Longtime business partner and friend of Michael Albert. Services Sanctuary of Abraham and Sarah, Paramus, NJ, Sunday, 10:30 AM. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, 550 N. Broadway, Suite 810, Baltimore, MD 21205 in memory of Douglas Zimmerman. For information, please call ''Wien &amp; Wien,'' 1-800-322-0533.</p>
        <p>ZIMMERMAN-Douglas. Beloved employer, friend, and mentor. We mourn the untimely passing of the co-owner of Plaza Packaging Corporation, who, through his tireless efforts, and thoughtful, intelligent planning, built upon the foundations of the past to help re-engineer the company to enable it to face the challenges of the 21st Century. We will miss his encouragement, his high standards, his humor, and his grace. Our deepest condolences to Gail, Ali, Alana and Mark, Beth, and the rest of the family. The Employees of Plaza Packaging Corporation</p>
        <p>ZIMMERMAN - Douglas. We grieve over the loss of a cherished friend, beloved family member and extraordinary business partner. Doug's life was too short, but filled with all the things he most enjoyed. His sense of adventure and beautiful spirit will live on through his greatest accomplishment, Alexandra. We will always be there for Ali. We mourn with all the family. Doug will forever be in our hearts. Michael, Randee, Ilana and Ross</p>
        <p>ZIMMERMAN-Douglas. Far too soon, we lost our employer, collegue, and friend. He was one-of-akind: a rugged individualist with an incredible work ethic and a heart of gold. May the memory of his innumerable good deeds and acts of kindness bring comfort to his family and many friends. Bruce, Elaine, and Morty</p>
