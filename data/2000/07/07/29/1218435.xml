        <p>Following are excerpts from an Israeli Television interview with President Clinton today, as transcribed by the White House Office of the Press Secretary:</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. President, how do you consider right now the relationship between Israel and the United States after the summit?</p>
        <p>A. Well, I think it's very strong. But I think in view of the courageous actions that the prime minister and the Israeli team took at the summit and in view of the withdrawal from Lebanon, I think some review and strengthening is in order.</p>
        <p>I plan to have a comprehensive review to improve our strategic relationship. We're going to have talks that will start right away, with a view toward what we can do to ensure that Israeli maintains its qualitative edge, modernizes the I.D.F. [Israeli Defense Force] and meets the new threats that Israel and the other countries will face in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I want to have a memorandum of understanding done as soon as possible with regard to our bilateral assistance, with a goal of making a long-term commitment to the necessary support to modernize the I.D.F. I think that's important.</p>
        <p>The third thing that I think is significant is that we provide assistance, which we will do, to Israel, to upgrade its security, in light of the withdrawal from Lebanon. And in that context, we also want to try to help the government of Lebanon to strengthen its ability to control south Lebanon. . . .</p>
        <p>You know, I have always wanted to move our embassy to West Jerusalem. We have a designated site there. I have not done so, because I didn't want to do anything to undermine our ability to help to broker a secure and fair and lasting peace for Israelis and for Palestinians. But in light of what has happened, I've taken that decision under review and I'll make a decision sometime between now and the end of the year on that. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. Can you assure the Israeli people that Barak isn't going to divide Jerusalem?</p>
        <p>A. . . . What I believe is that Prime Minister Barak in no way ever compromised the vital interests of the security of the state of Israel. One thing I think that I can say without violating either side is that the most progress in the talks was made in the area of security, where there was a surprising amount of consensus and an understanding that neither side would be secure after a peace agreement unless both were secure and unless both worked together. . . .</p>
        <p>Q. There is in the Congress some proposal to eliminate or prevent the use of aid to the Palestinians if they decide unilaterally to declare about statehood. Hillary Clinton, your wife, is for this proposal. What is your approach?</p>
        <p>A. Well, the bill has just been introduced. We don't give a great deal of aid there, as you know. And a lot of it is----</p>
        <p>Q. But it's very symbolic.</p>
        <p>A. Very symbolic. Well, let me just say this. I think there should not be a unilateral declaration. And if there is, our entire relationship will be reviewed -- not confined to that. So I don't -- I make it a practice normally when the bills are first introduced, and I haven't even reviewed them, not to comment, but I think it would be a big mistake to take a unilateral action and walk away from the peace process.</p>
        <p>And if it happens, there will inevitably be consequences. Not just here, but throughout the world. And things will happen. I would review our entire relationship.</p>
