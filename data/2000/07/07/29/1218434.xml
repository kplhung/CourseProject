        <p>City health officials announced yesterday that they had found the West Nile virus in nine more dead birds on Staten Island, but they said they had no plans to spray pesticide over the area because the birds had been infected before that borough and parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens were last sprayed.</p>

        <p>City health officials announced yesterday that they had found the West Nile virus in nine more dead birds on Staten Island, but they said they had no plans to spray pesticide over the area because the birds had been infected before that borough and parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens were last sprayed.</p>
        <p>The discovery in recent weeks of three infected birds in Queens and four on Staten Island, and in samples of mosquitoes in Central Park and on Staten Island, prompted the city to begin a ground spraying campaign that was largely completed early yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner, said yesterday that the discovery in the city of more infected birds -- eight crows and one blue jay -- underscored the need for the pesticide spraying, which has drawn harsh criticism and a lawsuit from environmental groups.</p>
        <p>Dead birds, especially crows, were abundant last year in areas struck by the mosquito-borne virus, which killed 7 people and seriously sickened 55 others in the New York region. Infected birds are considered an important warning sign that the virus is present. Birds pass the virus to mosquitoes that bite them, and people can be infected when they are bitten by the mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>''Clearly we needed to take the actions that we took,'' Dr. Cohen said in an interview. ''Even the evidence of one infected bird was a signal of virus transmission that needed to be addressed very aggressively.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said the city would not hesitate to spray again if officials found birds that were infected after the last round of spraying.</p>
        <p>State officials, who are conducting tests on birds across New York, reported yesterday that they had found two more infected crows, in Ulster and Onondaga Counties, bringing the statewide total to 67. They also reported that a total of 18 mosquito samples in Suffolk County had tested positive for the virus, bringing the statewide mosquito pool total to 25, including 3 in New York City.</p>
        <p>No human cases have been reported this year.</p>
        <p>In the city, a large section of Manhattan, from 23rd Street to 110th Street, between the Hudson and East Rivers, was sprayed overnight Thursday. However, officials said they planned to return early this morning to spray an area near Rockefeller Center that was not covered because hundreds of people were waiting in line for an outdoor concert by the pop band 'N Sync yesterday on NBC's ''Today.''</p>
        <p>City officials said yesterday that they were planning to spray for about a half-hour, starting at 2 a.m., between 46th and 53rd Streets, from Madison Avenue to Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>The effectiveness of the spraying, part of a $6 million city program aimed at detecting and stopping the spread of West Nile virus, is difficult to gauge. Dr. Cohen said that the pesticide the city is using, Anvil, can kill up to 90 percent of the adult mosquitoes in an area and that the mosquito population in traps within the sprayed areas had declined sharply since the spraying. But he said specific data was not yet available.</p>
