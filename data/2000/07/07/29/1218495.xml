        <p>Bill Mott and Jerry Bailey again demonstrated their dominance of turf racing as the lightly raced Hap roared home a winner in a crowded 13-horse field in the Grade II Bernard Baruch Handicap yesterday at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Mott-trained son of Theatrical nailed down his first stakes victory and collected $90,000 of the $150,000 purse for his owner, Madeleine Paulson, chiefly because Bailey executed quick thinking and agile hands heading into the first turn of the mile-and-an-eighth race. Breaking from the No. 9 post, Bailey was fanned eight wide before gunning the colt inside.</p>

        <p>Bill Mott and Jerry Bailey again demonstrated their dominance of turf racing as the lightly raced Hap roared home a winner in a crowded 13-horse field in the Grade II Bernard Baruch Handicap yesterday at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The Mott-trained son of Theatrical nailed down his first stakes victory and collected $90,000 of the $150,000 purse for his owner, Madeleine Paulson, chiefly because Bailey executed quick thinking and agile hands heading into the first turn of the mile-and-an-eighth race. Breaking from the No. 9 post, Bailey was fanned eight wide before gunning the colt inside.</p>
        <p>''It was either force the issue or take back,'' Bailey said. ''So, I pulled the trigger and let him go. We were third down the backstretch.''</p>
        <p>Bailey Hap chased an extremely quick pace by Gone Fishin before taking the lead in the stretch and holding off late runs from Inexplicable and Draw Shot. Hap paid $9.20 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
