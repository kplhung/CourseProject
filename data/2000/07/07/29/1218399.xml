        <p>Regulators in Florida yesterday rejected a proposal to let a troubled subsidiary of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York gradually make up a $4.8 million shortfall in its financial reserves.</p>
        <p>The Florida Department of Insurance instead gave the subsidiary, HIP Health Plan of Florida, until Aug. 15 to restore the reserve to the legally required level, by either lining up an investor willing to pump cash into the operation or securing a joint venture with another health care company.</p>
        <p>The Florida company has drained tens of millions of dollars from HIP's New York operation, which is also in financial trouble. The regulatory action in Florida adds to the pressure on HIP, a nonprofit health maintenance organization set up to insure New York City employees and the poor.</p>
        <p>Both the New York State Insurance Department and attorney general's office are investigating allegations of wasteful spending at HIP. The company was also hurt last year by the collapse of its operation in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>In Florida, the regulators placed HIP's subsidiary under special supervision last week out of concern that its reserves had fallen too low to cushion against unexpectedly large medical claims.</p>
        <p>Company officials then filed a proposal to eliminate the $4.8 million deficit over eight months by laying off 41 workers, cutting other costs and raising insurance premiums.</p>
        <p>But in a letter yesterday, Susanne K. Murphy, the deputy Florida insurance commissioner, told HIP officials that their plan would take too long.</p>
        <p>David Abernethy, the executive director of the HIP subsidiary, said he was disappointed that the plan was rejected. He said company officials were also negotiating with another health care company that might want to form a joint venture.</p>
