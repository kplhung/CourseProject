        <p>The Greater New York Bridge Association's Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship moved a step closer to a conclusion this week. Playing in the semifinal at Honors Club in Manhattan on Tuesday, Jon Greenspan, Bjorn Fallenius, Jim Sampson, Kent Mignocchi, Glenn Milgrim and Jared Lilienstein  won by 29 imps against a group led by Will Ehlers. Greenspan, who lost a  match in an earlier round, will now have to win twice against John Rengstorff's undefeated squad to take the title. Their first attempt will be on Aug. 21.</p>
        <p>A crucial deal from Tuesday's match is shown in the diagram. In one room, as shown, Sampson, South, became the declarer in four spades. This could have been defeated immediately if West had been inspired to lead the club ace and continue the suit to give his partner a ruff. He could then have regained the lead in hearts to provide a second ruff.</p>

        <p>The Greater New York Bridge Association's Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship moved a step closer to a conclusion this week. Playing in the semifinal at Honors Club in Manhattan on Tuesday, Jon Greenspan, Bjorn Fallenius, Jim Sampson, Kent Mignocchi, Glenn Milgrim and Jared Lilienstein  won by 29 imps against a group led by Will Ehlers. Greenspan, who lost a  match in an earlier round, will now have to win twice against John Rengstorff's undefeated squad to take the title. Their first attempt will be on Aug. 21.</p>
        <p>A crucial deal from Tuesday's match is shown in the diagram. In one room, as shown, Sampson, South, became the declarer in four spades. This could have been defeated immediately if West had been inspired to lead the club ace and continue the suit to give his partner a ruff. He could then have regained the lead in hearts to provide a second ruff.</p>
        <p>But West made the normal lead of a diamond, preserving his tenace positions in hearts and clubs. South won in dummy, cashed the spade ace and ruffed the diamond eight. He then drew trumps ending in dummy and cashed the remaining diamond winners, producing this position:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Now a club was led to the king. When West won with the ace, he was forced to give South a 10th trick, with either the heart king or the club jack.</p>
        <p>In the replay, Greenspan opened the West hand with four hearts, aiming to put pressure on North. That player tried four spades, reaching the same contract but from the opposite side of the table. West reopened with a double, showing that his opening bid included good defensive values. This left the final decision to Fallenius, East, who passed after some hesitation.</p>
        <p>If East had led his singleton club the defense could have taken the first four tricks. But East led the heart nine, leaving the contract in the balance. North played low from dummy and the nine won the trick. East noted his partner's heart five and shifted to his club eight, collecting two club tricks and a club ruff to defeat the game.</p>
        <p>From East's hesitant pass of four spades doubled, North might have  inferred that the heart nine was not a singleton. His winning play was to  cover the nine with the king, preventing East from retaining the lead. The  doubled contract could then have been made by maneuvering to score three diamond tricks and seven trump tricks. One heart would be ruffed low, and two with high trumps.</p>
