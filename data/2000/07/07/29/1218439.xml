        <p>It was Detective Sgt. Daniel Karas's last day on the job. Sergeant Karas, a hostage negotiator for the Port Authority police, was eating a piece of his retirement cake and preparing to turn in his badge and gun on Thursday night when the police radio crackled: a gunman had taken over an airplane about to leave for Las Vegas and was holding hostages.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Karas, 45, put the cake down, postponed the farewells and headed out from the Port Authority police station at Kennedy International Airport to Terminal 4. ''When that call comes, you go,'' he said later. ''I still had my badge and gun.''</p>
        <p>When he got to the airplane carrying National Airlines Flight 19, two colleagues, Detective Curtis King and Detective Lt. Robert Caron, had already begun talking with the gunman, who was holding the pilot and co-pilot hostage in the cockpit. Sergeant Karas joined in.</p>
        <p>Making contact was not easy. At first, the officers drove under the Boeing 757 and plugged a set of headphones and a mouthpiece into a jack that is usually used by ground crews to communicate with the pilots before takeoff. After talking to the gunman through the plane jack, the officers began to radio the cockpit through the airport's control tower.</p>
        <p>It was stressful work, with two lives held at gunpoint.</p>
        <p>''You run on adrenaline,'' said Detective King, the lead negotiator. ''You keep your fingers crossed.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Caron said the officers had one goal: to keep the gunman talking. ''The more you talk to him, the friendlier you get, the better your chances,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was, by all accounts, a rambling conversation. While none of the hostage negotiators would describe what was said, other police officials said the gunman, who was identified by law enforcement authorities as Aaron Commey, 22, asked to go to Antarctica, spoke about suicide and talked about wanting to go to South America.</p>
        <p>Just to keep him talking, they said, one of the officers asked Mr. Commey if he liked the Knicks. Using a vulgar expression, he responded that he did not.</p>
        <p>There was relief when Mr. Commey released the pilot around 12:10 a.m. yesterday and the co-pilot at 12:50 a.m. Then he remained alone in the cockpit -- with heavily armed police officers waiting in the plane's cabin -- for two and a half hours more before he surrendered. The 143 passengers aboard the plane had already escaped unharmed.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Karas, 45, went back to the Port Authority police station. In a sense, his 23-year career had come full circle: on July 4, 1977, just a few days after he joined the force, a Vermont-bound bus was hijacked from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and diverted to Kennedy in a bloody spree that paralyzed the airport and left two dead.</p>
        <p>He said yesterday that he was relieved that no one on the Boeing 757 was injured. He finally left work at 8 a.m. to turn in that badge and gun.</p>
        <p>Inspector Anthony Infante, the commander at Kennedy Airport, had this to say of the sergeant's last day: ''It was a hell of a goodbye.''</p>
