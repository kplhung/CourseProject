        <p>In Ohio, with God all things are still possible. At least for a few months anyway.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, a majority of the judges on the United States Court of Appeals voted to vacate a ruling made in April by a three-member panel of the court. That 2-to-1 ruling declared that Ohio's state motto, ''With God All Things Are Possible,'' was ''an endorsement of the Christian religion'' and therefore unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>The full Court of Appeals has decided to rehear the case, brought by the Ohio American Civil Liberties Union. Perhaps it hopes to do a better job of answering the question that has had Ohioans scratching their heads since April. They see the national motto, ''In God We Trust,'' stamped on every bill and coin they handle, adorning courtroom walls and prominently displayed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. So why is ''In God We Trust'' constitutional, as federal courts have repeatedly ruled, but not Ohio's ''With God All Things Are Possible''?</p>
        <p>The same question may interest residents of other states, like South Dakota (''Under God, the People Rule'') or Colorado (''Nothing Without the Deity'') or even Arizona (''Ditat Deus,'' which is Latin for ''God Enriches'').</p>
        <p>The crux of the matter is that ''With God All Things Are Possible'' are words spoken by Jesus in Matthew's Gospel (Chapter 19, Verse 26). ''In God We Trust,'' on the other hand, is of less certain provenance, most likely coming from the first line of the King James translation of Psalm 16 (''In Thee do I put my trust'') and filtered through the last verse of ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' (''Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: In God is our trust'').</p>
        <p>In April, this was enough for Judge Avern Cohn to conclude that Jesus' words represented a particular notion of salvation, ''a uniquely Christian thought not shared by Jews and Muslims.'' He may have been a bit hasty on that point since the Council on American-Islamic Relations promptly protested that similar language ''is used many times throughout the Koran.'' The president of the Islamic Society of Greater Columbus also noted that the A.C.L.U., in its solicitude for the rights of Muslims, had filed its suit without consulting any.</p>
        <p>Jewish reaction to the ruling, following a precedent of several thousand years, was divided, although a Christian theologian pointed to passages in the Psalms and other books of the Hebrew Bible expressing the same sentiment as Jesus' words.</p>
        <p>In a concurring opinion, Judge Gilbert S. Merritt was even more theologically subtle than Judge Cohn in finding differences between ''In God We Trust'' and ''With God All Things Are Possible.'' The two mottos speak of different ''Gods,'' he discovered.  The God of Ohio's motto is ''a personal, all-knowing God'' who makes all things possible through the ''miracle of supernatural intervention'' in daily affairs, Judge Merritt wrote.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ''the god in whom we 'trust' '' in the national motto, he went on, ''could be the god of Jefferson's deism or even perhaps the laws of science or the cosmology of Newton or Einstein.''</p>
        <p>With all this attention to the word ''God,'' it is surprising that the judges worried so little about the word ''we.'' After all, the national motto much more directly implicates the atheist citizen than does Ohio's. A logic-chopping atheist could even agree that ''with God all things are possible'' -- if there were a God, that is, which by an atheist's lights, there is not.</p>
        <p>Not many Ohioans were aware of their motto's suspect origins or its profound theological overtones. According to an A.C.L.U. poll, only 2 percent of Ohioans were aware of the motto at all.</p>
        <p>The motto has been around since 1959, three years after Congress got around to voting official standing to ''In God We Trust,'' which began appearing on United States currency in 1860. The ruckus in Ohio started with a plan to engrave ''With God All Things Are Possible'' in six-inch to eight-inch letters on a granite plaza near the statehouse, in the same square where the A.C.L.U. was last active defending the Ku Klux Klan's right to raise a cross.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, the Ohio motto may have been most noticeable -- and perhaps most consoling -- on all the forms sent out from the state's Department of Taxation.</p>
        <p>One can only hope that in rehearing the case the appeals court does not overlook any opportunities for public enlightenment. It would be interesting, for example, to hear a witness like the Rev. David T. Ball, the chaplain and director of religious life at Denison University in Granville, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Analyzing the case in the June 21-28 issue of The Christian Century, Mr. Ball noted that the state of Ohio had given the motto a meaning almost opposite Jesus'. ''It is a compelling symbol of hope, inspiration and stick-to-it-iveness,'' the state had argued in defense of the motto.</p>
        <p>In Matthew's Gospel, however, Jesus' words came right after he had pronounced that ''it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.'' His disciples were surprised and asked ''Then who can be saved?'' For humans it is impossible, Jesus replied, but ''with God all things are possible.''</p>
        <p>In other words, this was originally not a booster's affirmation of God-backed enterprise and human potential. It was Jesus' declaration of divine power contrasted to human frailty. Precisely to avoid that misinterpretation, Mr. Ball writes, the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible does not use ''with God'' but translates the passage ''For God all things are possible.''</p>
        <p>The reminder that this phrase is a translation of a Greek text about a man who spoke Aramaic suggests other witnesses the court could call. One, of course, could be a member of the band of skeptical biblical scholars known as the Jesus Seminar, who could testify that in the Seminar's own edition of the Gospels these words appear in black, meaning that Jesus did not say or believe them but that they came from later Christians.</p>
        <p>Most important would be a post-modern theoretician of texts and their interpretation. Does a phrase like this get its meaning from its original context or from how it has come to be used? If Americans discovered tomorrow that ''In God We Trust'' was originally a Hindu mantra, does it mean that the currency endorses Hinduism?</p>
        <p>Such testimony might provide amusement as well as enlightenment, and it is hard to see what else this whole exercise is accomplishing.</p>
