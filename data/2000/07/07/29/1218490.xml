        <p>Correction of July 28 report on new home for McBurney YMCA, regarding information on space being purchased</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, a report in the Metro Briefing column yesterday about a new home for the McBurney Y.M.C.A. on the site of the old 14th Street Armory in Manhattan referred incorrectly to the space being purchased. The Y.M.C.A. will buy 67,000 square feet on two floors of a two-building complex totaling 350,000 square feet; it is not purchasing the armory site.</p>
        <p>Also because of an editing error, the report misidentified the signer of a letter of intent for the space. It was the parent Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, not McBurney itself.</p>
        <p>The report also included an erroneous figure from the developer for the number of rental apartments in the complex. It is to be 225, not 180.</p>
