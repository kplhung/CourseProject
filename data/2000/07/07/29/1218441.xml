        <p>The American economy grew at a surprisingly robust 5.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. The news of the unexpectedly strong growth sent stocks plummeting as investors feared the Federal Reserve might increase interest rates again. The Nasdaq composite index plunged 4.7 percent, finishing the week off 10.5 percent, its third worst week. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 74.96 points, to 10,511.17, and was down 2.1 percent for the week.</p>
