        <p>Two weeks after a federal appeals panel reactivated Megan's Law, a state court ruling is preventing county prosecutors from enforcing penalties against those who improperly spread information they receive about offenders.</p>
        <p>To guard the privacy and safety of sex offenders, notification information provided to their neighbors and nearby schools has been accompanied by warnings that recipients are subject to prosecution if, for instance, they post the information on a telephone pole or shoot at the offender's house. Some counties specifically warned that recipients would be subject to contempt of court charges for abusing the information.</p>
        <p>But on July 14, the day after Megan's Law was reinstated by a federal appeals panel, the New Jersey State Supreme Court, which has authority over state judicial procedures, ruled that the warnings must be uniform, and therefore no counties should include the language regarding contempt.</p>
        <p>This prompted John B. Dangler, president of the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey, to tell The Associated Press yesterday that prosecutors therefore do not have specific legal grounds to punish abuses of notification information.</p>
        <p>''If the court says you cannot bring forth contempt of court charges, you're in a dilemma,'' he told the A.P. ''If you don't have any teeth in the law, it's going to be very difficult to have it enforced.''</p>
        <p>His remarks come as the state public defenders' office is seeking to prohibit notification of offenders' addresses, asserting that the information is protected by their right to privacy. The office is also seeking to prohibit naming the blocks on which offenders live, claiming that along with a name and photograph, that information is sufficient to deduce the address. Notifications had been suspended by another appeals panel while the case is decided, but were reinstated two weeks ago by the panel that will decide on the address issue.</p>
        <p>The public defender is not seeking to limit information in cases where recipients sign a pledge agreeing that they are subject to contempt charges if they abuse the information, said Jeff Beach, a spokesman for the office.</p>
