        <p>The coaches for Saturday's Major League Soccer All-Star Game said their best strategy would be to ''stay out of the way'' of the players.</p>
        <p>''This is about the players,'' said Bob Gansler of the Kansas City Wizards, who will coach the West team. ''Let them show their wares and the coaches stay out of the way.'' East Coach Octavio Zambrano, with six of his MetroStars in the game, certainly agrees with Gansler.</p>

        <p>Lothar Matthaus leads the MetroStars' contingent, which also includes Mike Ammann, Clint Mathis, Mark Chung, Adolfo Valencia and Mike Petke. Matthaus is nursing a slipped disk but said after today's practice that he expected to play ''maybe 30 minutes'' Saturday.</p>
        <p>Crew Stadium, which seats 22,255, is sold out for Saturday's game, which will start at 3:30 p.m. and be broadcast on ABC.</p>
