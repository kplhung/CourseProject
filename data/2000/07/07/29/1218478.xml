        <p>The left side of the Mets infield will be overhauled today, when Mike Bordick arrives from Baltimore to play shortstop and Robin Ventura returns from the disabled list to reclaim his third-base job.</p>
        <p>Ventura is a Gold Glover, and Bordick may be the best fielder who has not won one. Asked what he brings to a team, Bordick said: ''In the field, hopefully just consistency. That's what I've strived for my whole career -- make the plays when the ball's hit to me.''</p>

        <p>The left side of the Mets infield will be overhauled today, when Mike Bordick arrives from Baltimore to play shortstop and Robin Ventura returns from the disabled list to reclaim his third-base job.</p>
        <p>Ventura is a Gold Glover, and Bordick may be the best fielder who has not won one. Asked what he brings to a team, Bordick said: ''In the field, hopefully just consistency. That's what I've strived for my whole career -- make the plays when the ball's hit to me.''</p>
        <p>The Mets will welcome that, because they know they cannot win many more games the way they have the last two days. The Mets made seven errors on Thursday but swept a doubleheader against the Expos, and they beat the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium last night, 3-2, despite two more errors in the late innings, one by third baseman Lenny Harris and the other by shortstop Kurt Abbott.</p>
        <p>The Mets prevailed because of the pitching of Al Leiter and three relievers, and one pickoff move. Leiter (11-4) worked seven innings, striking out eight and allowing a run on three hits. The bullpen -- which will also get a boost today when the newly acquired setup man Rick White arrives from Tampa Bay -- secured the victory, with Armando Benitez earning his 24th save.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals trailed, 3-1, in the seventh when Eduardo Perez hit a hard grounder in the hole between third and short. Abbott ranged to his right and could not come up with the ball; it was unjustly scored an error, Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The bases were loaded, and Leiter thought back two starts, to a loss at Toronto. Frustrated with the umpire's ball-strike calls, Leiter had grooved a pitch with the bases loaded and given up a grand slam. This time, he stayed tough, striking out Mike Matheney and inducing the pinch-hitter Craig Paquette to pop out, ending the inning.</p>
        <p>''I had that thought in my mind -- I'm not laying anything in there,'' Leiter said. ''If I walk him, I walk him, but I'm not giving in.''</p>
        <p>John Franco, who had not allowed a run in his last 13 appearances, relieved Leiter to start the eighth. But Franco was not sharp, giving up two singles and retiring one hitter. Turk Wendell came on to face the Cardinals' clean-up hitter, Fernando Tatis, with runners at the corners. It was the perfect occasion for Wendell's signature pickoff move, faking to third and then throwing to first.</p>
        <p>Wendell perfected it three springs ago when the former pitching coach Bob Apodaca told him his third-to-first move was horrible. Taking the challenge, Wendell spent 20 minutes in the bullpen that day, working solely on that move. Now, he picks off several runners a year that way.</p>
        <p>''Every time I do it, I chuckle -- there you go, 'Dac,'' Wendell said. ''I might want to send him a videotape.''</p>
        <p>Wendell had picked off a Montreal runner doing that on Thursday, and he did it again last night, faking to third and spinning to first to freeze Jim Edmonds, who crawled right into Todd Zeile's tag for the second out of the inning.</p>
        <p>Tatis grounded to third, where Harris bobbled the ball, allowing Fernando Vina to score to cut the Mets' lead to 3-2. But Wendell blew a fastball by Eric Davis to end the inning, escaping further harm.</p>
        <p>The Mets got all their runs in the second inning. Mike Piazza hit a leadoff single, and Zeile followed with a walk. Benny Agbayani then drove a pitch off the wall in right-center field, scoring Piazza. A Jay Payton groundout brought in Zeile, and Abbott flied to shallow center field.</p>
        <p>Edmonds caught it and fired to home plate, where the bulky Agbayani was bearing down on the catcher, Matheney. Edmonds's throw took one hop and bounced off Matheney's body; a moment later, Agbayani barreled into home.</p>
        <p>Edmonds was credited with an assist, Matheney was charged with an error and Agbayani's run gave the Mets a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>That was enough for Leiter, who snapped a personal three-start losing streak and said he has overcome a ''dead-arm'' phase and had probably his best stuff of the year last night. Valentine agreed.</p>
        <p>''I thought he threw as well as he's thrown all year,'' Valentine said. ''He was determined, free, he threw all his pitches for strikes. It was a terrific effort by him, as well as by Turk and Armando.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Third baseman ROBIN VENTURA said he expected to come off the disabled list today. Ventura tested his bruised right rotator cuff by making about 30 throws before the game, and he also took batting practice. . . . Right fielder DEREK BELL was back in the lineup after leaving the second game of Thursday's doubleheader when he felt light-headed. Bell said he had become woozy and nauseated because he had an upset stomach and had taken aspirin after he was hit in the chin by a ball in the first game, requiring three stitches. ''I feel awesome today,'' Bell said.</p>
