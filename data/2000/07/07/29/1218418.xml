        <p>The record industry, struggling against rampant unauthorized downloading of copyrighted music on the Internet, cheered when it got a preliminary injunction this week against Napster Inc., the Internet music directory service. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals swiftly stayed the injunction issued by Federal District Judge Marilyn Patel. The appeals court, noting that substantial new legal questions had been raised in this case, has scheduled oral argument for September. In the meantime, Napster will continue operating.</p>
        <p>This case represents only the beginning of the legal and technological challenge to maintain the legitimate right of artists, writers, scholars and corporations to reap economic benefits from the intellectual property that they create, whether in real space or cyberspace.</p>
        <p>The protection of copyrights is vital to the health of a free and creative society. It is not simply an economic issue, though many enterprises, this newspaper included, rely on copyright protection. The society at large benefits when the law assures that the creation of new art, writing or other intellectual property is rewarded. To defend that principle in cyberspace, the courts, Congress and information industries must find ways to sustain and adapt copyright law without stifling the development of new technologies. This will be no easy task.</p>
        <p>Some 20 million people have downloaded Napster's software program, which allows users to find and exchange music files directly with the computers of other users. Napster does not keep or control the music files, but provides a directory of files that tells users what is available to be shared by other users who are online at the same time. The vast majority of music being downloaded this way is copyrighted. But the record companies could not in any practical way sue the millions of Napster users who they say are illegally copying the music.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs instead sued Napster for contributory copyright infringement, on the grounds that the service makes it possible for the wholesale infringement to occur. On Wednesday, Judge Patel agreed and issued an immediate injunction prohibiting Napster from enabling its users to download copyrighted music. The injunction left Napster free to offer its services for non-copyrighted works, but Napster's lawyers said that the service could not distinguish between copyrighted music files and non-copyrighted files. The appeals court granted it an emergency stay of that injunction.</p>
        <p>Judge Patel's interpretation of copyright protection under existing law seems reasonable, but she acknowledged in her oral ruling that it was hard to make a ''neat fit'' in applying copyright law to cases involving new technology. In the 1984 Sony Betamax case, the Supreme Court ruled that Sony could not be prohibited from making and selling VCR's because the machines were ''capable of substantial noninfringing uses'' even though they could be illegally used. That decision opened the way to a booming video business that has benefited  the movie industry plaintiffs in the Sony case. Ultimately the courts will have to determine whether Napster technology has legitimate uses.</p>
        <p>Even a legal victory against Napster will not shield the recording industry from Internet infringement. Newer technology such as Gnutella and Freenet allow Napster-like computer-to-computer file sharing without a central list manager. These programs also enable users to engage in widespread copyright infringement, but since there is no central server, there is no company to sue. Yet they offer potential benefits -- such as more efficient content searches -- that could be extremely important for the Internet's development.</p>
        <p>In the digital era, enforcement of copyrights may depend as much on new technological answers as on court sanctions. In the next few years, the recording industry and other content creators may find that adding anti-copying features to digital material and developing whole new ways to sell their products and services to users will become  primary to protecting intellectual property online.</p>
