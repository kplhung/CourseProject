        <p>The two weeks President Clinton spent with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians certainly had moments of great drama, when nerve-tingling discussions about the fate of the holy city of Jerusalem breached for the first time what all sides called the taboo issue.</p>
        <p>There were also moments of crisis, as when Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel nearly choked to death on a peanut and White House officials worried about how they would explain his death to conspiracy theorists around the world. A member of the prime minister's own team delivered the life-saving Heimlich maneuver.</p>
        <p>There were light moments, when Israeli and Palestinian negotiators traded cigars, bowled, played Ping-Pong and dodged deer and chipmunks as they navigated paved paths in golf carts.</p>
        <p>There were bizarre moments, when Mr. Clinton broke his own news blackout by musing about the talks with an editor of The Daily News in New York, without telling any of his aides of the interview that was intended to help defend his wife against accusations that she made an anti-Semitic slur in 1974.</p>
        <p>And through it all there were negotiations, day and night, as Mr. Clinton, Mr. Barak and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, drew on a their full array of bluffs and brinkmanship, rhetoric and reason as they invented, rejected and embraced creative solutions to ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic moment came midway through talks, when Mr. Clinton gripped Mr. Arafat's hands tightly, sitting so close to him that they touched foreheads. The president implored, flattered, threatened and wooed, promising everything he could -- the creation of a Palestinian state, the financial support of the world to pay for it, a permanent place for Mr. Arafat in the pantheon of history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did not stop there. It would be another week before the president acknowledged that the summit meeting would not produce a peace agreement.</p>
        <p>At 2:10 a.m. last Tuesday, 15 days after Mr. Clinton had brought Israelis and Palestinians to Camp David to resolve issues that had eluded them for half a century, the 71-year-old Palestinian leader said no.</p>
        <p>But that morning, as the Palestinian leader contemplated Mr. Clinton's offer in his cabin on the secluded, wooded complex, neither Mr. Arafat nor Mr. Barak could escape the ghosts of the first Camp David summit meeting, in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter brought together Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt for what proved to be successful peacemaking.</p>
        <p>A glass case of photographs from that meeting was prominently displayed in a cabin called Holly, where many key meetings took place, and a three-page, hand-written note of appreciation from Mr. Carter to Mr. Begin hung on a wall.</p>
        <p>''Both leaders were preoccupied with the weight and presence of history,'' said Aaron D. Miller, a senior American negotiator. ''There was a sense that we were not alone.''</p>
        <p>The last moment came when Mr. Arafat sent Saeb Erekat, a trusted aide, and Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian chief of security, to Mr. Clinton's cabin, with grim faces and a brief letter, handwritten in Arabic on the official stationery of the Palestinians. Mr. Erakat slowly read the letter aloud, translating for Mr. Clinton and advisers who were with him, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser.</p>
        <p>''I can't go further than I've gone,'' a senior administration official paraphrased Mr. Arafat as saying. ''The suggestions I have heard do not take us in the direction I find acceptable.''</p>
        <p>After the emissaries left, Mr. Clinton told his aides, ''I don't like to fail, particularly at this.''</p>
        <p>The letter did not surprise. Even though Mr. Clinton had used all his powers of persuasion to coax a shaken Mr. Arafat into a settlement, he already had the sense that the Palestinian leader was disengaging, becoming even more quiet and passive than he had been during the talks.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Clinton had been intense in his pitch-making, so intense that a half-dozen of his aides, including the chief negotiator, Dennis Ross, and the president's chief of staff, John Podesta, hid themselves in the kitchen to eavesdrop on the president's critical session alone with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>They took turns watching the scene through a porthole in the swinging glass door that led to the living room, cracking the door a little to catch snippets of the conversation. At one point, one of the aides recounted, so many of them pressed against the glass that he feared they would push the door open and pour into the room like bureaucratic Marx brothers.</p>
        <p>But in the end, this was not Mr. Arafat's time to make the boldest gesture of his 30-year career as the leader of the Palestinian people. And after his letter was delivered, Mr. Clinton would be with him again only briefly, in a goodbye session with Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>''The president sat with them and told them that everyone has worked very hard and given their best but they couldn't get there,'' Dr. Albright recalled in an interview. ''They shook hands. And that was that.''</p>
        <p>And so, another chapter in the peace effort concluded. It had been a failed negotiation, but it had been a remarkable one as well, and already Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are talking about getting together again.</p>
        <p>For more than a month, Mr. Clinton had been eager to convene the summit meeting. Mr. Barak was badgering him to do it, arguing during repeated phone calls that only what he called ''the pressure cooker'' of such a meeting would force through excruciating decisions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat wanted a few more weeks to prepare. ''He said, 'The time is not ripe,' '' Dr. Albright said of her meeting with Mr. Arafat in late June. ''But he also said that he had the highest respect for the president and would do as he was asked.''</p>
        <p>Driving the decision was the reality of the American political calendar. Holding the summit meeting during the Republican convention, in early August, was out of the question, because it could be seen by Republicans as politically driven. Mr. Clinton was also boxed in by a commitment to go to Japan on July 19 for a meeting of the Group of 8 leading industrial nations. Most important, the deadline of Sept. 13 loomed large -- the date by which Mr. Arafat said he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Administration officials acknowledge that Mr. Arafat bore the greatest burden.</p>
        <p>No Arab leader with whom he had consulted -- including President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Abdullah of Jordan and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia -- offered support for surrendering claim to sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>For the first several days of the talks, both sides postured. At one point, Mr. Clinton got so angry that he told both sides: ''This is ridiculous. If this is what you're going to do, we shouldn't be here.''</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, discussions opened up, substantively, on the most serious of issues: the status of Jerusalem. On July 17, the sixth day of the meeting, Mr. Barak wrote proposals to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Barak put final touches on those offers, he did what he always does when he feels pressured: he ate.</p>
        <p>A peanut lodged in his throat, and for 40 tense seconds, he stopped breathing as helpless aides looked on.</p>
        <p>''It was scary, but the people around the prime minister were more scared than the prime minister,'' recalled Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a senior Israeli negotiator. One aide began pounding him on the back, to no avail.</p>
        <p>Finally, Gid Gernstein, the youngest member of the Israeli delegation, rushed to Mr. Barak and performed the Heimlich maneuver. A peanut came flying out.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Barak arrived at Mr. Clinton's doorstep after midnight, he had some ideas that moved away from the traditional Israeli position on Jerusalem. When Mr. Clinton took the ideas to Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian was singularly unimpressed, an American official said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, throughout the talks, Mr. Arafat seemed oddly passive. He referred to himself repeatedly as the ''permanent vice president'' of the Organization of the Islamic Conference uniting Muslim countries around the world. ''He wasn't speaking just for himself,'' one senior official said. ''He was speaking for a billion Muslims and the two million Arabs in the region as well.''</p>
        <p>To bridge the differences, the Americans presented ideas of their own to Mr. Arafat. In the living room of the president's cabin on the evening of July 18, Mr. Clinton sat him down and, with only Gemal Helal, the State Department's Arabic interpreter, at his side, told the Palestinian what a mistake he was making.</p>
        <p>''The president said to Arafat: 'I will go to the G-8 meeting in Japan on Wednesday and I will ask them to provide the support you need for your state,' '' Mr. Berger reported. '' 'What I ask you to do is to make a principled compromise on Jerusalem. It is not everything you want, but it's the price you have to pay.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat said little as Mr. Clinton grabbed him by the arms and placed his forehead to Mr. Arafat's in what Mr. Berger called ''the Lyndon B. Johnson style of persuasion.''</p>
        <p>When that tactic did not work, Mr. Clinton suggested to Mr. Arafat that he consider a partial settlement that would defer matters about Jerusalem. Mr. Arafat refused.</p>
        <p>The morning of Mr. Clinton's departure arrived, and the president decided that there was little point in continuing the talks.</p>
        <p>At 10:50 p.m., the White House press office released a two-sentence statement that screamed ''failure.''</p>
        <p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>
        <p>''As word went out, the trees talked,'' said Mr. Berger, referring to the instant rumor network at Camp David. Mr. Barak was convinced by several of his negotiators that he should not go home empty-handed. Mr. Arafat never wanted to leave.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton left for Japan and, in his absence, the mood calmed. Dr. Albright invited Mr. Arafat to her farm near Leesburg, Va., where they dined on canned sardines (which he requested, Dr. Albright said). Mr. Barak, meanwhile, visited Gettysburg with Dr. Albright and Bruce Riedel, the senior Middle East official at the National Security Council and a Civil War buff.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Clinton returned from Japan that Sunday night, the negotiators reported enough progress to proceed.</p>
        <p>In three back-to-back sessions, Mr. Clinton, seated at the dining room table in his cabin, with two negotiators from each side, made headway on security, refugees and borders. For the sake of a peace to ensure Israel's security, Mr. Barak was entertaining a sizable transfer of West Bank territory, the evacuation of settlements, a land swap, a small resettlement plan for Palestinian refugees and the ceding of some Jerusalem neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''We could begin to see the contours of an agreement on these issues,'' Mr. Berger said.</p>
        <p>Now was the moment for the final push on Jerusalem. Mr. Clinton asked each leader to appoint a single negotiator to meet with him on what turned out to be the last night of the summit meeting. Between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Ross, the special coordinator for the Middle East, sat Mr. Erekat and an Israeli, Shlomo Ben-Ami.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton presented three scenarios for Jerusalem, with variations along the way, diplomats said. The first laid out how the issues of sovereignty might be resolved, including in the Old City, where the Palestinians would be given sovereignty over the Muslim and Christian quarters and the Israelis would have the Jewish and Armenian quarters. Another proposal revolved around the Palestinians' having sovereignty over several of the neighborhoods surrounding the Old City and having administrative autonomy within the walls. A third notion suggested deferring the Jerusalem problem for years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also put forward another possibility: no agreement at all. As he talked through the proposals, Mr. Erekat's body language made clear that the Palestinians were not playing, and it was codified in Mr. Arafat's letter.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Erekat told the ABC news program ''Nightline'' after the talks ended, the peace effort ''did not collapse; it did not fail.''</p>
        <p>''These things are on the table,'' he said. ''I'm not talking about science fiction. I'm not talking about dreams. I am talking about two peoples who are trying to reshape their relationships.''</p>
