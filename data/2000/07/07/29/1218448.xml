        <p>The press is bored. The public is bored. Even Dick Cheney looks bored. It wasn't until George W. Bush chose a man who makes Brian Lamb seem like Jerry Springer that I fully appreciated the sheer genius of his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>What Governor Bush recognizes is that at this crisis-free moment of maximum American contentment and minimal American political involvement, relentlessly beatific imagery and oratorical Muzak really can carry the day. Repeat ''compassionate conservatism,'' ''a tone of civility,'' ''inclusion,'' ''tolerance'' and ''heart'' often enough and no one's going to look too hard at the fine print. Especially if you're posing in ''inclusive'' photo ops worthy of a Benetton campaign.</p>
        <p>The Cheney nomination is the perfect proof. Democrats are loudly labeling him an extremist, and they're not wrong. If you are one of only 21 members of Congress who voted against regulating cop-killer bullets -- or one of only eight against the Clean Water Act -- that puts you, by numerical definition, at the extreme end of the political spectrum. No less an authority than Newt Gingrich said this week that Mr. Cheney's record was ''slightly more conservative'' than his own. Still, even as Democrats cite these votes ad infinitum -- Congressman Cheney was against a resolution calling for the freeing of Nelson Mandela, despite his efforts to fudge the issue now -- where will it get them?</p>
        <p>The non-ideological swing voters likely to decide this election take one look at Mr. Cheney, or catch one monotonous sound bite, then promptly trance out and forget what the Democrats are barking about. Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, once wrote a novel about a vice president whose death was kept secret, and while this scenario may not be literally true in the case of her husband, it is metaphorically so. The mild, round, expressionless Mr. Cheney is like a deadening cushion that will soften, absorb or deflect any rhetorical weapons that Al Gore might hurl at him -- much as Mr. Bush's mastery of don't-worry-be-happy theatrics has ever since his campaign made its sole major slip-up to date, the detour to Bob Jones. The Texas governor has even managed to play down his role as the country's Lord High Executioner by suppressing the smirk and invoking the deity once Gary Graham was dead.</p>
        <p>Democrats, frustrated by both Mr. Bush's affable image and the small target offered by his slim resume in public life, claim to be ecstatic about gaining Mr. Cheney as a fatter target. If so, they are delusional -- or at least hopelessly out of touch with the culture in which this campaign is unfolding. In a time of what Jesse Jackson has aptly named ''prosperity fatigue,'' more Americans care about who is going to be voted off the island on ''Survivor'' or who will succeed Kathie Lee Gifford on the Regis morning ticket than who will be the next vice president. After ''Survivor,'' just in time for the debates, come the Olympics, another distraction from what is already proving a stealth election year. This month 43 percent of Americans told pollsters they wouldn't watch the G.O.P. convention -- a rise from 23 percent in '96. A Pew survey shows that the number of those thinking ''quite a lot'' about the election is also down steeply from the same summer juncture of both '96 and '92. ''Even most registered Republicans'' are unaware that their party's convention is looming, according to Harvard's Vanishing Voter survey.</p>
        <p>This is a boon to the Bush campaign. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, it was a plus, not a minus, when the Cheney announcement was knocked off the evening news lead by the Concorde crash and the collapse of the Mideast peace talks. A few seconds of Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney in a warming Prince-Hal-and-Falstaff pose served to convey the campaign's desired message, with no time left for dissonant interference. The same goes for the convention next week. Programmed to be as soothing as a Claritin commercial -- even Clinton-bashing is on mute -- the G.O.P. spectacular in Philadelphia will defy in-depth network coverage. If channel surfers glimpse a snapshot of the inclusiveness, that's good enough. And that's all most of them will get: such is the state of convention coverage that tomorrow Tom Brokaw headlines a panel at Philadelphia City Hall titled ''Is There a Future for on-the-Air Televised Conventions?'' that (at two hours) is itself scheduled to run longer than the slots the big three broadcast networks have allotted to the convention in prime time most nights.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' hope that TV might sight some G.O.P. fisticuffs next week can be safely pronounced dead. The compassion pageant will rise from monotony only in the unlikely event that the campaign unchains Lynne Cheney, who tends not to be as on-script as her husband. A sometime occupant of Pat Buchanan's chair on ''Crossfire,'' she wraps the moralistic certitude of Laura Schlessinger in a humorlessness that might make America nostalgic for Marilyn Quayle.</p>
        <p>Neither is the traditional civil war over abortion likely to disturb the peace. The religious right can gloat this year, not thunder, since Mr. Cheney is actually to the right of Mr. Bush on the issue -- no easy feat. As for that small band of potentially noisy pro-choice Republican leaders, most I've spoken to this week are ready to declare a truce for a mere pat on the head -- a couple of sentences professing tolerance for their views in a platform that continues to call for the outlawing of all abortions. They aren't getting even that, but don't expect any drama. Hardly had the Cheney announcement dashed pipe dreams of a Tom Ridge or George Pataki than some pro-choicers began retreating to the line that Mr. Bush is O.K. because he has promised not to make a pro-life stance a ''litmus test'' for Supreme Court nominees. That's a flimsy straw to cling to, given that the governor's favorite sitting justices are the vehemently anti-choice Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia and that his appointee as the top health official in Texas, Dr. William Archer, is not only anti-choice but against giving teenagers birth-control information that might prevent unwanted pregnancies.</p>
        <p>But as Susan Cullman of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition points out, the Bush campaign is betting that its disciplined focus on education uber alles and equally disciplined silence about abortion will neutralize his anti-choice stance to busy suburban voters. And she may be right. A single photo op with a few hand-picked homosexuals papered over Mr. Bush's career-long failure to speak up for civil rights for gay people. Should anyone bring up his non-compassionate record on AIDS -- in fact a nonexistent record in his first five years as governor of a state with the fourth-highest caseload -- a hospital visit could turn the tide.</p>
        <p>To learn the genesis of this campaign technique, look not to old Reagan-Bush strategies but to Dana Milbank's recent Washington Post account of Mr. Bush's stint as owner of the Texas Rangers. The salesmanship used to boost that struggling baseball franchise seems a blueprint for the campaign. To ensure favorable press coverage, Mr. Bush flattered reporters and gave them ''a great press box.'' Though catering to the rich by adding a profusion of luxury boxes to his new stadium, he hired an architect to camouflage the class distinctions from the hoi polloi. ''I'm not so sure you can segue from baseball to a presidency,'' Mr. Bush said modestly to Mr. Milbank, ''but there are some lessons about management, about developing a strategy. Baseball is a marketing business.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore is in the marketing business too, but his frenetic style and frequent changes of costume are all wrong for this easy-listening time. He's a manic stickler for details going up against a calm stickler for generalities. The vice president's best hope may be that Mr. Bush is as complacent as the sure victor the G.O.P. nominated in Philadelphia 52 years ago, Thomas Dewey. But Mr. Gore is no Harry Truman. Plain speaking is not, shall we say, his forte, and his attack rhetoric merely plays into the Republicans' hands by paradoxically making him, not Mr. Bush or Mr. Cheney, seem more like a slashing politician of the despised Gingrich era in Washington. Expressing his frustration with the Bush campaign's success in theatrics while on the stump this week, Mr. Gore told the crowd, ''You and I know this is not about show business.''</p>
        <p>What country does this guy think he's living in?</p>
