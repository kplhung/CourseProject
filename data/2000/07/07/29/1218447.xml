        <p>At this time last season, Ray Lucas was struggling to make the transition from special teams player to quarterback and striving just to make the Jets roster. Now, after having helped salvage the season with a 6-3 record after Vinny Testaverde tore an Achilles' tendon and Rick Mirer faltered, Lucas is a substitute scorned.</p>
        <p>Lucas, who had hoped to secure a long-term contract in the off-season, was stunned by the drafting of quarterback Chad Pennington in the first round and by the contentious contract negotiations that resulted in Lucas's signing a one-year tender for $385,000, the league minimum.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to trust anybody in this business,'' Lucas said. ''I'm not here to cause any waves. We'll have to see what happens at the end of the year. It's a business. They drafted him. They said he was the future. Maybe that's how it's going to pan out.''</p>
        <p>One of Lucas's biggest boosters was Bill Parcells, the Jets' former head coach and now their director of football operations, who coached Lucas at New England. Their relationship appears to have soured since Parcells took part in the contract negotiations.</p>
        <p>''We don't really talk that much anymore,'' Lucas said. ''He's in the front office. I don't really see him.''</p>
        <p>Lucas is secure as Testaverde's backup, but after this season he will be a restricted free agent. The Jets are likely to give him a high tender offer. If the Jets choose not to match an offer from another team, they will receive a high draft pick in return.</p>
        <p>The Jets could also trade Lucas after this season, receiving draft picks in return. Those options depend on Testaverde returning for another season.</p>
        <p>Lucas still seems determined to be a team player, saying he will help Pennington learn the system.</p>
        <p>''Ray is such a great guy,'' Pennington said. ''He's made my transition really smooth. He's always got words of encouragement.''</p>
        <p>Still, Lucas concedes that it is difficult to return to a backup role after the success he enjoyed as a starter.</p>
        <p>''That was a dream come true and then to be that successful, it's hard to come back,'' Lucas said. ''When you've got a guy like Vinny Testaverde, there's no question in my mind where I'm supposed to be right now. We have a great chance to win when he's in there, but I don't think it falls off that much when I'm in there.''</p>
        <p>While Lucas said there was nowhere else he wanted to be, it was clear he had begun to contemplate his future elsewhere. ''I'm a starting quarterback in the N.F.L.,'' he said, ''and that's how I see it in my mind.''</p>
