        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, on his way here for a triumphal nomination, ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding next week's convention by killing efforts to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, on his way here for a triumphal nomination, ended the last bit of uncertainty surrounding next week's convention by killing efforts to allow voters in all states to cast primary ballots that actually counted.</p>
        <p>The plan, designed by the Republican National Committee after this year's nominations were settled in March, was intended to lengthen the primary season by making the big states vote last. Under the plan, the smallest states would have held their primaries in February, small states in March, medium-size states in April and big states in May.</p>
        <p>On May 12, Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, told reporters that Mr. Bush had no position then on the plan and would have none later. But this morning Mr. Rove passed the word to members of the convention rules committee that the campaign wanted it killed, and the committee duly voted to kill it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's intervention on the primary proposal bluntly brushed aside several months' work of party leaders, like the Republican chairman, Jim Nicholson, to design a new system, and there was a bit of mystery today surrounding the Bush camp's reasons. The people Mr. Rove talked to either declined to quote his stated reasons or dismissed them as implausible. Most members put the last-minute move down to a desire to have a convention utterly free of conflict, even if the fight would take place hours before prime time.</p>
        <p>One high-level Bush aide said the campaign feared its re-election efforts would be hindered if a new calendar led states to shift from primaries to caucuses and state conventions in 2004. Some rules committee members said Democrats would keep states like California and New York from changing the dates of primaries, forcing Republicans in those states to use caucuses. The aide called caucuses a ''breeding ground'' for trouble. Republican caucuses often fall under control of the party's most right-wing elements.</p>
        <p>''Karl did express some concern to several members of the rules committee, saying we were concerned this would put the Republicans at a competitive disadvantage,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a Bush spokeswoman. She said the Bush campaign also had concerns ''that it would limit the number of candidates who are able to participate in so many places all at once.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, while the campaign was still neutral, the Republican National Committee voted 92 to 55 to approve the plan and send it to the Rules Committee. Today, after Mr. Rove intervened, the committee voted 66 to 33 to reject it. The losers had enough support to bring a minority report to the floor on Monday, but they said they would not.</p>
        <p>That same firm control was evident today in platform committee deliberations. While abortion-rights advocates argued, passionately if unavailingly, for a softening of the party's stance, and conservatives demanded tougher language on education, neither side had the inclination or the strength for a floor fight.</p>
        <p>After killing the big-states-last plan, the rules committee also voted down an effort to give the national committee new authority to negotiate with the Democrats on a system that did not have so many states voting so early that it resembled a national primary.</p>
        <p>Morton Blackwell, a committee member from Virginia, said one virtue of the Republican Party was that its rules were ''locked in concrete'' from one convention to the next. He said if the national committee was given this authority, which the Democratic National Committee already has, ''we could have heaven knows what imposed on us from the top.'' That vote was 72 to 28, even though the Bush campaign took no stand on it.</p>
        <p>One indication of the utter control displayed by the Bush campaign over the plan to string out the primaries was the unwillingness of the losers even to complain about it during the meeting. Indeed, the Bush position was never mentioned, except when Tom Sansonetti of Wyoming, the chairman of the rules committee, told the meeting that the Bush campaign had no position. That was minutes before Mr. Rove told him things had changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sansonetti said in an interview that Mr. Rove had told him the Bush campaign thought the plan was flawed because candidates would have to undergo heavy, tiring travel in February, when a dozen very small states would vote.</p>
        <p>That objection, also cited today on the Bush campaign plane by a spokesman, Scott McClellan, had never been raised in any meeting on the plan, where the early, small-state campaigning was specifically designed to keep any candidate from dominating all the early states, and thereby to give underfinanced hopefuls a chance to make an impression by an early victory.</p>
        <p>Bill Brock, the former senator from Tennessee and former Republican chairman whose commission produced the plan, said Mr. Rove had given him the same explanation.</p>
        <p>David Norcross, a rules committee member from New Jersey who had been among the plan's most enthusiastic supporters until this week, said the Bush campaign had raised the travel question with him, too, along with the problem that some states might face if Democrats blocked any change.</p>
        <p>He said no one from the Bush camp had mentioned a desire to avoid a floor fight to him. The closest anyone came to admitting that motive was when Ms. Hughes, the Bush spokeswoman, said, ''Obviously we want our convention to focus primarily on Governor Bush and his positive proposal for America, but we wanted people to be heard in the process.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''We think that people had a chance to express a lot of different opinions about a better way to nominate a president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Norcross deserted the plan he had once strongly advocated, and when he moved to kill it in the rules committee, he said he was just reacting to a ''convergence of problems'' around the plan. He cited travel costs and the fear of big states that they would have no influence because they would have come last. Mr. Blackwell, who supported the plan, sarcastically praised Mr. Norcross for his ''versatility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sansonetti vainly pleaded for the plan, saying that this year ''two-thirds of the states did not have the opportunity to have a say in the choice of the most powerful person in the world.'' He said 30 states voted within 8 days, and more would do so next time.</p>
        <p>He scoffed at the travel argument, saying: ''They are already traveling all over. If they're not in a primary, they are raising money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sansonetti argued that the proposed system would leave the winner uncertain until the end because the big states had more than half the delegates. That would make every vote meaningful, he said.</p>
        <p>But Tom Rath, a committee member from New Hampshire, disagreed. He said, ''The race ends politically a lot earlier than it ends mathematically.'' He said that although Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore were seen as certain winners after the March 7 primaries, they did not yet have the delegates needed for nomination. Those majorities were reached on March 14.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blackwell also defended the plan, saying the political system faced ''a problem which cries out for solution.'' A national primary, he warned, would only nominate ''candidates who are personally wealthy or candidates who are favored by the media.''</p>
