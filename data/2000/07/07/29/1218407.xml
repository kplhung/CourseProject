        <p>Candice Carpenter, who has come to epitomize the hard struggle to establish Internet companies in New York, has relinquished the title of chief executive of iVillage to Doug McCormick, the company's president.

        <p>Candice Carpenter, who has come to epitomize the hard struggle to establish Internet companies in New York, has relinquished the title of chief executive of iVillage to Doug McCormick, the company's president. Ms. Carpenter, whose move was announced Thursday, will remain as chairwoman of the board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter, a veteran of American Express and QVC, founded iVillage in 1995 to be an Internet site focusing on topics of interest to women. As West Coast Internet start-ups were flooded with venture capital, iVillage struggled to raise money amid skepticism both of New York as a technology center and of the idea of an advertiser-supported Web site that would require hundreds of writers and producers to operate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter was able to raise enough venture capital, and iVillage went public in March 1999, along with a number of other New York Internet companies. But iVillage has also been plagued by questions regarding what employees called Ms. Carpenter's mercurial management style.</p>
        <p>In particular, the turnover among senior executives is higher than at  similar companies. Recently, Craig Monaghan, the fifth chief financial officer, and Allison Abraham, the chief operating officer, left the company. Last year, Robert Levitan, one of the three co-founders along with Ms. Carpenter and Nancy Evans, the editor in chief, left to start Flooz, an online gift-certificate company.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCormick, who was the chief executive of Lifetime, the cable network for women, joined iVillage as the No. 2 executive in April.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter said yesterday that she had long thought that Mr. McCormick would ultimately become chief executive. With his background in advertising sales, Mr. McCormick has the skills necessary to guide iVillage.</p>
        <p>''Five and a half years has been a very long haul,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ''I feel happy that we found somebody I feel confident handing the company to.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter said that she would spend more time on strategy, figuring out the company's international expansion plans, and doing public speaking.</p>
        <p>The company announced second-quarter results on Thursday. It lost $28 million, compared with a loss of $15 million in the period a year earlier. Its revenue was $19 million, triple the previous year.</p>
        <p>Shares of iVillage slipped 28 cents yesterday, to $6.25, a 52-week low.</p>
        <p>''It was a true baptism of fire,'' said Mr. McCormick of his first months at the company. Advertising from Internet companies fell, and the company scrambled to cut costs and increase business from more established companies. While it has not had any layoffs, iVillage has scaled back its hiring, planning 380 employees at year end, down from its earlier forecast of 400, he said.</p>
        <p>Analysts generally favored Mr. McCormick's promotion.</p>
        <p>''It's very positive for iVillage to hand over the reins to a seasoned veteran like Doug McCormick and at the same time allow Candice to do what she does best: play the visionary,'' said Paul Noglows, an analyst with Chase H &amp; Q.</p>
