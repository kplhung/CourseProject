        <p>Re ''How Slavery Fueled Business in the North,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, July 24):</p>
        <p>I believe that many nonblacks in America could be brought around to national compensation to black Americans for the value of slave labor extracted from their ancestors. Nonblack Americans, however, will not and should not accept personal responsibility for events that happened before anyone now living was born.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''How Slavery Fueled Business in the North,'' by Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, July 24):</p>
        <p>I believe that many nonblacks in America could be brought around to national compensation to black Americans for the value of slave labor extracted from their ancestors. Nonblack Americans, however, will not and should not accept personal responsibility for events that happened before anyone now living was born.</p>
        <p>I believe that the slavery ''reparations'' bill of Representative John Conyers Jr. would stand a much better chance if its supporters would make one simple change: call it a ''compensation'' bill, thereby avoiding the sense of direct moral culpability that ''reparations'' implies.</p>
        <p>This would make such a bill more a matter of addressing unfinished national business than of perpetuating resentment and guilt based on a history that cannot be changed but can be acknowledged.</p>
