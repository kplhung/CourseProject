        <p>From the moment the fight was made, many people who follow the sport of boxing, including Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have challenged the wisdom of sanctioning a 12-round title fight between Kostya Tszyu, the World Boxing Council superlightweight champion, and Julio Cesar Chavez.</p>
        <p>Chavez will face Tszyu at 11 tonight at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>They say that Chavez, 38, who has not fought a top 10 contender in more than a year, does not deserve the opportunity. They say that Chavez, who lost last October to the unheralded Willy Wise, should not still be ranked the top contender, which made the bout mandatory. They say that Chavez, a six-time champion with a record of 103-4-2 and 86 knockouts, is long past his prime and risks serious injury by stepping in the ring with the powerful Tszyu, who is eight years younger.</p>
        <p>The critics have said a lot. Tonight it will be Chavez's turn to make his own statement.</p>
        <p>Chavez weighed in yesterday at 140 pounds, the class limit. His chances of winning are not too promising; the major sports books in Las Vegas casinos would not even post odds, because the fight is considered such a mismatch.</p>
        <p>But Chavez, a legend in Mexico, is expected at least to have the crowd behind him. The Russian-born Tszyu, who now lives in Australia, received a glimpse of the intense Chavez loyalty when he heard boos during the weigh-in. He tipped the scales at 139 pounds.</p>
        <p>Chavez has trained hard and has a sparkle in his eye, said Vlad Wharton, Tszyu's promoter. ''It will be an explosive fight,'' he said. ''I think he's angry at the criticism he has endured. He's got a lot of motivation.''</p>
        <p>Motivation may not be enough. Tszyu has an impressive right hand and an impressive resume. He has lost once in 26 fights and has 20 knockouts. One more knockout tonight would certainly confirm the misgivings of the fight's numerous critics.</p>
