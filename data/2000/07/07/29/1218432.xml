        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>CLINTON CRITICIZES BUSH  As hundreds of Democrats feasted on lobster and clams yesterday at a fund-raiser  for Representative Patrick J. Kennedy in Barrington, R.I., President Clinton served up some partisan zingers.  Mr. Clinton mocked Gov. George W. Bush for his gee-whiz attitude toward the presidency. ''I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team. They like me down there,'' Mr. Clinton said, imitating Mr. Bush. ''Everything is rocking along hunky-dory. Their fraternity had it for eight years. Give it to ours for eight years.'' The president said the Republicans were trying to blur the serious policy differences, especially over how to handle the budget surplus, between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. ''That's the message, isn't it? Blur, blur, blur,'' he said. The president helped Mr. Kennedy raise $450,000 for his Congressional campaign and then flew to Boston, where two events last night collected $950,000 for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTION</p>
        <p>PROTEST SITE SET IN LOS ANGELES  Lawyers for civil liberties groups and the City of Los Angeles agreed yesterday on a protest site for demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention, a parking lot across from the entrance to the Staples Center, where the convention will be held in mid-August, officials said. A federal judge had ruled last week that the proposed site, in a parking lot farther away and out of sight and earshot of entering delegates, was unconstitutionally restrictive.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>POLLS GIVE BUSH A WIDER LEAD  Vice President Al Gore had appeared to be steadily chipping away at Gov. George W. Bush's lead in the polls, and in several had almost pulled even. But since Tuesday, when Mr. Bush picked Dick Cheney to be his running mate, the Texas governor has reopened the gap to double digits, two polls indicated. A Time magazine poll released yesterday found that Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 16 percentage points, 52 percent to 36 percent. Ralph Nader of the Green Party had 5 percent, and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party 4 percent. A CNN-USA Today Gallup Poll on Thursday had Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. Gore by 11 points, 50 percent to 39 percent. Mr. Nader had 4 percent and Mr. Buchanan 1 percent. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
