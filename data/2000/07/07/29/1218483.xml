        <p>On a day when David Cone was sent to the Yankees' minor league complex in Florida in an attempt to salvage his season, the Yankees were engaged in talks that could result in the trade of first baseman Tino Martinez.</p>

        <p>On a day when David Cone was sent to the Yankees' minor league complex in Florida in an attempt to salvage his season, the Yankees were engaged in talks that could result in the trade of first baseman Tino Martinez.</p>
        <p>The Baltimore Orioles are discussing a trade that would send outfielder B. J. Surhoff and infielder Jeff Conine to the Yankees in return for Martinez, according to a Major League Baseball executive. The Yankees are trying to bolster their lineup before Monday's trade deadline, and Surhoff would become their left fielder, while Conine, a good defensive infielder, presumably would play first base.</p>
        <p>Martinez, 32, has been an integral part of the Yankees' attack since replacing Don Mattingly before the 1996 season, driving home more than 100 runs every season. His production has been in an incremental but steady decline, particularly his power production, and it had been widely assumed that next year Nick Johnson, a top prospect, would challenge him for the job. Johnson has not played this year after injuring a hand in spring training. When the Yankees exercised his option for 2001, Martinez agreed to waive his rights to veto a trade.</p>
        <p>Martinez, who has always hit well in Baltimore's Camden Yards, will make $6 million next year because the Yankees exercised an option on his contract in spring training. Surhoff, who turns 36 next week, will make $3.5 million in 2001 and most likely qualify for a vesting option that will pay him $4.5 million in 2002. Martinez began play tonight batting .254 with 9 homers and 58 runs batted in, while Surhoff is hitting .295, Conine .285.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can make a deal for Montreal's Rondell White in return for Alfonso Soriano, another top prospect, a move that would improve the major league team. But the Yankees may have some big-picture concerns about surrendering their most developed prospect for a corner outfielder -- one of the easiest positions to fill -- who will essentially bat at the end of the Yankees' order.</p>
        <p>They would like to keep Soriano to swap for a more important demand, such as pitching, which is why they continue to pursue talks for Surhoff. The Orioles have interest in shortstop D'Angelo Jimenez, who broke a bone in his neck in an off-season car accident. The Orioles are concerned about Jimenez's condition, however, after a physician affiliated with the team examined Jimenez's post-accident medical records, with permission from the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Yankees can make other trades if they cannot make a deal for White or Surhoff, including a possible deal for the Rangers' Chad Curtis -- a former Yankee who starred in last year's World Series -- and Philadelphia's Ron Gant.</p>
        <p>Cone, just a year and 10 days removed from the day he pitched a perfect game, has been sent to Tampa, Fla., at the behest of the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, phoned Manager Joe Torre after Cone allowed eight runs in five-plus innings in a loss to the Minnesota Twins Thursday night and told him of Steinbrenner's suggestion. The news was relayed today to Cone, whose next start may not come until Aug. 6, at the earliest. According to Torre, Cone, a former Cy Young award winner, accepted the suggestion professionally and ''was not insulted.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are also asking around about the possibility of dealing for a pitcher, which is related, at least indirectly, to Cone's struggles. He has not won a game since April 28, and the Yankees have lost the last 12 games that Cone has started. His earned run average is 6.88 and he has allowed 129 hits, 52 walks and 20 home runs in 106 innings. He has pitched well enough to win a few of his starts, but his struggles have hurt the team.</p>
        <p>Cone will work with Billy Connors, the team's vice president for player personnel in charge of pitching. It was Connors who worked with Dwight Gooden in Florida before Gooden's recent comeback. Connors also worked with Roger Clemens before Clemens began his current five-game winning streak. Cone will work out in the bullpen in Tampa over the weekend. Torre said Cone would rejoin the team on Tuesday when it returned  to Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''George suggested it, since nothing seemed to be working,'' Cashman said. ''Billy had some success with Doc, so we figured we would try it. Cone had an open mind about it.''</p>
        <p>Torre spoke with Cone this afternoon. ''He's feeling badly about how he's done, and he's probably open to whatever'' is suggested, Torre said. ''If it's going to help, let's try it. Who knows? I don't think he was insulted at all.</p>
        <p>''With other guys, you would've taken him out of the rotation a long time ago. But anybody with David's resume, and what he's meant to this team both physically and emotionally to this ballclub, you're always going to give him the ball. I am, anyway. Last night was very hard to watch. You could just look at him and see how much he's hurting -- not physically.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' scheduled day off Monday gives Torre the option of skipping Cone in the rotation the next time around, which Torre is expected to do. Dwight Gooden will probably pitch Tuesday, followed by Denny Neagle, Clemens and Andy Pettitte, and Cone could fall in line Aug. 6. Cone's time in the rotation could be short-lived, anyway, because Orlando Hernandez could be activated from the disabled list in a couple of weeks. Cone, 37, will most likely be replaced by El Duque.</p>
