        <p>On any given day in the summer, as many as a dozen dirt-bike riders, most decked out in kaleidoscopic jumpsuits, can be seen jumping and turning and speeding through the weeds, mud and occasional obstacles -- like rusting car frames -- in Ferry Point Park, a former city landfill in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The riders have spent long hours carving trails into the rocky weed-covered ground and shaping dirt mounds to use as jumps. They have fashioned turns around trees and even created a lounge area where they can see the action in the shade of a maple tree.</p>

        <p>On any given day in the summer, as many as a dozen dirt-bike riders, most decked out in kaleidoscopic jumpsuits, can be seen jumping and turning and speeding through the weeds, mud and occasional obstacles -- like rusting car frames -- in Ferry Point Park, a former city landfill in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The riders have spent long hours carving trails into the rocky weed-covered ground and shaping dirt mounds to use as jumps. They have fashioned turns around trees and even created a lounge area where they can see the action in the shade of a maple tree.</p>
        <p>But with a developer beginning construction last week of a 222-acre golf course in the eastern portion of Ferry Point, a 418-acre park in the Throgs Neck section where many of the bike tracks are, local motocross enthusiasts are lamenting the last days of one of the few places in the city suitable for riding.</p>
        <p>''This is not the best track, but it is close and it is free,'' said Wellington Kandre, a professional motocross racer who said he moved from the Dominican Republic six months ago to try American courses.</p>
        <p>''They have plenty of golf courses here, but not one track,'' said Mr. Kandre, who lives in Washington Heights. ''They should build one for us.''</p>
        <p>The 18-hole, par-72 course is being built by Ferry Point Partners, a private developer, and is expected to be completed in the fall of 2001, city officials said. Ferry Point Partners is spending $22.4 million to build the course and some restaurants, a promenade and ball fields and playgrounds. The city is allowing the developer to run the course and restaurants, which will be open to the public, for 35 years.</p>
        <p>While the golf course and its amenities have been largely cheered by community leaders and residents, the motocross enthusiasts who gathered at the track last weekend found it hard to fathom being displaced by, of all things, a golf course.</p>
        <p>''Who plays golf?'' asked Jose Rojas, a truck driver from the Bronx who was at the park with his 14-year-old son, Jose Jr. ''Rich people and snobs. And rich people and snobs won't want to golf in the Bronx, they'll go to country clubs. This golf course is a stupid idea.''</p>
        <p>City officials, however, are unlikely to be swayed. A parks official said that the riding in Ferry Point Park was certainly not encouraged.</p>
        <p>''It's not a permissible use of parkland,'' said Alan M. Moss, the first deputy commissioner for the Parks Department. ''But it's the kind of thing that's very hard to police.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss said that the park would be gated off in the next two weeks as dump trucks carry in fill to shape the golf course. That will effectively spell the end for the dirt bikers. Parks officials, he added, are not likely to accommodate the riding in the future.</p>
        <p>For the riders at the track recently, the city's point of view prompted anger and dismay.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Rojas equipped his son like a gladiator, with a hard plastic chest plate and a helmet, he looked on as Jose Jr. got on his new Honda CR80 dirt bike and ripped through the course, spitting dirt behind him and speeding toward a six-foot-high mound from which he launched a dozen feet in the air. Boy and bike crashed down in the mud and grass an instant later, then sped toward a hairpin turn.</p>
        <p>''I guess he got it from me, because look, he's only had a bike for two months, and he's completely comfortable,'' Mr. Rohas said.</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's a clean sport. To ride a bike you have to be smart and you have to be fit. It keeps kids off the street, and it teaches them mental discipline. I think that the city forgets that.''</p>
        <p>His voice faded as Jose roared up in a cloud of dust. ''I'm eating up the track today, Dad. Wow,'' he said, panting as he took off his helmet and squinted in the setting sun.</p>
