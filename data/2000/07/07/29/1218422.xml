        <p>Another political hurdle was cleared yesterday in an attempt to have North Korea and South Korea march together in the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee said it endorsed a request by North Korea to have the divided nations march under the Olympic flag and to exclude the national flags of the two countries from the opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>South Korea has indicated it would not oppose such a request, said Franklin Servan-Schreiber, a spokesman for the I.O.C. He said that formal responses were being awaited from both the North and South. Ministers from both nations are expected to discuss the matter at meetings this weekend, Servan-Schreiber said.</p>
        <p>Athletes would still compete as separate nations in Sydney, and separate anthems would be played for medal winners. Kim Un-Yong, a powerful I.O.C. member from South Korea, said yesterday that the two nations might compete as one at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.</p>
        <p>A march of about 500 athletes from the divided peninsula would provide a powerful international symbol of the desire for reunification, as expressed at a summit meeting last month in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.</p>
