        <p>The Philadelphia sandwich delicacy known as the cheese steak is made of thinly sliced beef that is quick-grilled in light oil, topped with fried onions, cheese and peppers and served hot and dripping on what locals call a hoagie roll, elsewhere known as Italian bread or a hero roll.

        <p>The Philadelphia sandwich delicacy known as the cheese steak is made of thinly sliced beef that is quick-grilled in light oil, topped with fried onions, cheese and peppers and served hot and dripping on what locals call a hoagie roll, elsewhere known as Italian bread or a hero roll. At hoagie shops in South Philly, the waitresses address you as ''hon'' -- as in ''Whatcha want on your cheese steak, hon?'' -- as though they have known you all their lives.</p>
        <p>Mayor John Street counts every calorie, and has replaced his predecessor's candy dish with a bowl of fresh fruit. But Philadelphia is nonetheless counting on the cholesterol- drenched cheese steak to win hearts and minds during next week's Republican Convention, the city's first in more than 50 years. Nearly bankrupt at the start of the 90's, Philadelphia has fought its way back, revitalizing its downtown and stanching job loss for the first time in decades.</p>
        <p>The austere Mr. Street and his voluble predecessor, Ed Rendell, have jointly promoted the Republican Convention as the moment of Philadelphia's rebirth and a chance to show off the new city to visitors and the press. But when the conventioneers leave, the urban wastelands in the shadow of downtown's glittering towers will still remain. Reclaiming those wastelands -- and persuading Philadelphians who are still leaving the city to stay -- will be considerably more difficult than renovating the city center.</p>
        <p>The poverty and industrial decline that struck most big cities during the 1960's and 70's were particularly devastating to Philly, partly because the city was so poorly managed. In the 70's that management was synonymous with Frank Rizzo, the racially divisive police chief whose Bull Connor style got him elected to three terms as mayor. His pledge during a re-election campaign to make ''Attila the Hun look like a faggot'' mortified the city's remaining corporate elite and worsened racial tensions that were already bad.</p>
        <p>City politics turned macabre under Mayor Wilson Goode, who was installed as the first black mayor in 1983. This mild-mannered former city manager seemed a safe choice after Mr. Rizzo, yet it was his police department that in 1985 bombed the home of a black radical cult known as Move. The Move bombing, which burned 60 houses along West Philadelphia's Osage Avenue, demoralized the city and became a national metaphor for stumbling municipal leadership.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Rendell, a former Philadelphia district attorney, was elected mayor in 1992 the city had a $250 million deficit and its bonds were rated below junk status. Financial World magazine ranked it as the worst-managed of America's 30 largest cities. On the verge of bankruptcy, the city threatened to pay its workers in scrip. Thus chastened, the unions accepted budget cuts and austerity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rendell persuaded residents to see hope where none seemed to exist. He talked of the greatness and wonder of the city, even as downtown Philadelphia hollowed out, leaving many great buildings empty.</p>
        <p>The rebirth of that downtown is partly a testament to Mr. Rendell's wide-eyed optimism, and at his instigation the city has come to view the convention as a coming-out party at which the new Philadelphia can replace the dismal past with a glittering new vision of the future.</p>
        <p>But only in the last three years has the city proper experienced a net gain in jobs, reversing a trend that is decades old. Philadelphia has lost more than 167,000 people over the last nine years -- more than any city of comparable size. That means that 10.6 percent of the population has chosen to go elsewhere. Any attempt to stop these defections must focus on the schools, which are clearly among the worst in the country, even after improvements posted by the celebrated city school superintendent David Hornbeck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hornbeck left his job after he seemed to liken Pennsylvania's treatment of minority school children to that of South Africa under apartheid and filed a Federal lawsuit accusing the state of systemically underfinancing schools attended by black children. For the Republican state government in Harrisburg this was the last straw. But funding statistics lent credence to this view and made it clear that chronic underfinancing was inhibiting a full recovery in the city. Until the schools are made decent, the middle class will continue to ebb away.</p>
        <p>Despite the progress under Mr. Rendell, there were more than 35,000 abandoned cars littering city streets when he left office, contributing to a sense of hopelessness and desolation. Mr. Street has towed nearly all of these away, but it takes only a short drive from City Hall to find urban deterioration at its most extreme, with open-air drug marts and consecutive blocks of decay. The Street administration has proposed floating $250 million in bonds to eliminate this blight.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia's city center will be on display for conventioneers as a shining image of accomplishment.  But reclaiming the city's far-flung neighborhoods will require another round of leadership, money and heartfelt dedication.</p>
