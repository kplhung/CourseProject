        <p>He has pushed off his left foot, scrambled out of the pocket and backpedaled at full speed. His right arm is at full strength and his instincts are just as sharp. Now, with no limp in his step but butterflies in his stomach, Vinny Testaverde will test his repaired Achilles' tendon in the only situation that really matters: against a live, enemy rush.</p>
        <p>The Jets have many questions confronting them as they begin their preseason schedule Saturday night against the New Orleans Saints at Giants Stadium. Will the post-Parcells era be as successful? Is there a wide receiver with the spirit and the skill to replace Keyshawn Johnson? Was the beginnings of a pass rush found in the draft? Is there a free safety in the house? Is Anthony Becht the tight end to make everyone forget the blemishes that Kyle Brady and Eric Green put on that position? What will the brief glimpses of the quarterback of the future, Chad Pennington, look like?</p>
        <p>But there is one answer that neither the Jets nor Testaverde can wait for. After watching a season of high hopes collapse after only 20 minutes of football last year, all eyes will be focused on one place when the Jets' offense takes the field.</p>
        <p>''I've been looking forward to it for quite some time,'' Testaverde said. ''The closer it gets, the more butterflies build up after missing almost a full year of football. The butterflies include just missing a whole year, not being in contact, hit or sacked in that live situation. Just getting back in the routine of preparing for a game; that's part of the nervousness. I look forward to playing this game. I hope things go well so that I can continue to build confidence off this game. At the same time, I'd like it to get over with.''</p>
        <p>For Testaverde, the first hurdle is as much psychological as it is physical, because he is still on an arc in preparation for the regular-season opener, Sept. 3 at Green Bay. Testaverde said his left leg is still not as strong as his right, but there have been no outward signs of that weakness. He conceded early in training camp that he felt rusty, but he has slowly shorn that rust, revealing a quarterback every bit as reliable as the one the Jets last saw in full in the American Football Conference championship game in Denver about 18 months ago. He has placed his passes perfectly and has not hesitated in his movements.</p>
        <p>His backup, Ray Lucas, said today that he cannot tell that Testaverde had an injury, and Curtis Martin said he thought Testaverde might be better and stronger, having benefited from the year of rest to his arms and legs.</p>
        <p>Already in training camp, the game has slowed down, Testaverde said, to the point where he can better see the field.</p>
        <p>''He's definitely there,'' Lucas said. ''He used to be a little tight. He's nice and loose and he's really looking forward to getting started. I can't wait until we get into the tunnel. I want to see his eyes. He'll probably have big, wide eyes, like somebody shined a light in them.''</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh, in his first game as the Jets' head coach, said each of the three quarterbacks -- Testaverde, Lucas and Pennington -- will get about 20 plays, and that would be enough. Groh was asked what, all things considered, he hopes to see from Testaverde.</p>
        <p>''I don't have all things considered,'' Groh said. ''We've got Vinny. I expect to see Vinny. Last time I saw Vinny play was in Denver in January 1999, and he was a pretty darn good quarterback, and I expect to see the same thing.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The three candidates for the free safety position -- OMAR STOUTMIRE, KEVIN WILLIAMS and SCOTT FROST -- will rotate with the first unit in a race that Coach AL GROH said is very likely to continue for a while. Right ends SHANE BURTON and ANTHONY COOK will also rotate with the first-team defense, and linebacker JOHN ABRAHAM will play with the first team in pass-rush situations. . . . Cornerback RAY MICKENS (hamstring), defensive end ERIC OGBOGU (shoulder) and nose tackle JASON WILTZ (elbow) will not dress for the game. Linebacker MO LEWIS (strain behind knee) will dress, but Groh said it will be a game-time decision whether he will play.</p>
