        <p>The General Electric Company named Robert C. Wright, the longtime president of NBC, to the additional post of vice chairman of G.E. yesterday. He will join the chairman, John F. Welch Jr., and one other vice chairman, Dennis D. Dammerman, a financial officer, as the only G.E. executives on the company's board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright, who has led NBC for 14 years, the longest tenure for any top executive in network television  history, will continue to manage the network and all of its other media assets, which include the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC.</p>
        <p>The move comes nine months before the retirement date of Mr. Welch, who is close to Mr. Wright professionally and personally. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Welch praised Mr. Wright as a ''key force in guiding the company's future growth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright, 57, is not a candidate to succeed Mr. Welch, a job expected to go to a G.E. executive younger than 50. But television industry executives interpreted Mr. Wright's elevation as an effort by Mr. Welch to emphasize the importance of NBC's assets to the future of G.E.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wright said in a telephone interview: ''It's good recognition for NBC and our media assets, for what NBC has accomplished. It gives our media assets an important voice at the G.E. table.'' He emphasized that his new position will not significantly change his day-to-day role at NBC. ''In the near term, I keep doing the job,'' Mr. Wright said. ''I'm not going anywhere.'' But he said the new position will probably mean ''that I'll pitch in and take on some assignments in G.E.'s larger picture.''</p>
        <p>NBC has often been the subject of rumors about a sale to a Hollywood production studio. It has been suggested that NBC -- without any connection to a bigger entertainment conglomerate as CBS now has with Viacom, Fox has with the News Corporation and ABC has with the Walt Disney Company -- will be at a disadvantage in a media world dominated by huge entities like AOL Time Warner. The arrival of a new chairman is likely to start new speculation about G.E. shedding NBC. Mr. Wright said that the G.E. emphasis on maintaining growth in earnings has made it ''a real challenge'' when ''trying to do deals to keep ourselves growing.'' Unlike other media companies, NBC had not been able to add assets if the acquisition price could dilute the company's earnings.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wright said he expected NBC to remain a highly valued asset for G.E. ''The national use of video content is going to be hugely important to the marketplace going forward,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
