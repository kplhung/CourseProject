        <p>Lincoln Center has named Rebecca Robertson, a city planner who led the government effort to redevelop West 42nd Street, to be the field marshal in its $1.5 billion rebuilding project.</p>
        <p>The appointment, confirmed yesterday, is part of a new management plan to oversee and finance the redevelopment project, by far the largest in the center's four-decade history.</p>
        <p>The actions were detailed by Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, in a telephone interview after word of Ms. Robertson's appointment began circulating informally.</p>
        <p>She said construction could start in two years and would take until 2010 to complete, upsetting many performing schedules as it proceeds.</p>
        <p>''We are moving ahead quite steadily,'' Ms. Sills said.</p>
        <p>As outlined in December in a consultant's study, the projected work -- new structures, rooftop additions, skyboxes and widespread repairs -- is likely to cost more in adjusted dollars than the original Lincoln Center, the world's biggest and busiest performing arts presenter. The city has committed $96 million to the project, but the bulk of the money remains to be raised. Difficult questions also remain about how to reschedule performances around the construction work.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robertson, now vice president for real estate and special projects at the Shubert Organization, said in an interview yesterday that she would begin work part time at Lincoln Center on Aug. 7 and full time in mid-September, ''supervising the master-planning of the complex, its vision and implementation.'' She is to report to a new renovation committee under a vice chairman of Lincoln Center, Marshall Rose, a leading real estate developer.</p>
        <p>That panel, in turn, is answerable to a new Project Leadership Committee composed of the chairmen and artistic directors of the center's 12 resident arts organizations, including the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet and Opera.</p>
        <p>The chairwoman of the leadership committee, which first met on Jan. 31, is Ms. Sills, who is also supervising the search for a new president of Lincoln Center to replace Nathan Leventhal, who is leaving on Dec. 31 after 17 years. The panel met most recently on Thursday, when Ms. Robertson was introduced.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robertson will be the executive director of the reconstruction committee, and a second committee will supervise fund-raising for the project. Its co-chairmen will probably be four major money-raisers, but they have not been appointed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robertson, 50, described the Lincoln Center project as ''the great urban renewal project of New York City.''</p>
        <p>She said she envisaged the job's taking easily as long as the decade she spent on the overhaul of 42nd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. For the last seven years of her tenure, which ended in 1997, she was president of the 42nd Street Development Project Inc. The state-chartered entity attracted Disney, Livent, Forest City Ratner and other entertainment and redevelopment companies as replacements for evicted sex storefronts and X-rated movie houses.</p>
        <p>Before that Ms. Robertson, who was born in Canada, worked in planning and development in Toronto and Caracas and in the New York City Planning Department. She joined the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner, in 1997 and, among other projects, helped develop the new 499-seat Shubert theater being built on Theater Row on West 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sills said that the leadership committee was intended to reassure Lincoln Center's constituent groups that they would have a central say in the rebuilding.</p>
        <p>The scope of the project covering the 18 acres Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues and 62nd and 66th Streets has not been determined. In its three-inch-thick report to the board last December, the Manhattan architectural firm Beyer, Blinder &amp; Belle laid out a range of needs, from repairs to the cracked plaza paving blocks and deteriorating travertine cladding on the buildings to additional rehearsal, performing and reception space.</p>
        <p>In particular, the study says, the options included rooftop additions and skyboxes for Avery Fisher Hall, where the Philharmonic performs, another rooftop addition for the Juilliard School, a loft for Alice Tully Hall, new space for the New York State Theater, an expanded lobby and museum for the Metropolitan Opera, a new central visitors' center and ticket office and a new administrative building in Damrosch Park.</p>
        <p>Last December some Lincoln Center executives described some items as part of a wish list that was to be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sills said yesterday that the cost might grow beyond $1.5 billion. ''At first we thought a lot of it was just wish list,'' she said. ''I do not think it's a wish list any more.''</p>
