        <p>Walter L. McCaffrey, a veteran city councilman who was challenging Representative Joseph Crowley in a Democratic Congressional primary in Queens, said yesterday that he was withdrawing from the race after a report that he had spent campaign funds for personal expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaffrey's withdrawal came two days after New York 1 News reported -- and Mr. McCaffrey acknowledged -- that he had written $54,000 in checks to himself from his campaign fund during the last two years.

        <p>Walter L. McCaffrey, a veteran city councilman who was challenging Representative Joseph Crowley in a Democratic Congressional primary in Queens, said yesterday that he was withdrawing from the race after a report that he had spent campaign funds for personal expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaffrey's withdrawal came two days after New York 1 News reported -- and Mr. McCaffrey acknowledged -- that he had written $54,000 in checks to himself from his campaign fund during the last two years. He said the money was spent mainly to pay car service bills that had routinely exceeded $400 a week.</p>
        <p>''Questions about my financial filings and difficulties in raising sufficient funds have cast a cloud over the campaign,'' Mr. McCaffrey said in a statement issued by his Congressional campaign committee. ''While I have done nothing wrong, I realize that I cannot conduct a difficult race with these issues unresolved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaffrey produced a letter provided earlier in the week by a Queens car service attesting to his frequent use of its cars, but he said he could not provide a more detailed accounting of the personal expenses. Mr. McCaffrey does not drive, and is known to have relied on car services for years to commute between City Hall, meetings with constituents and his Woodside home.</p>
        <p>While his withdrawal was prompted by financial questions, the announcement yesterday came after two years of turbulent infighting among Queens Democrats that pitted Mr. McCaffrey and others against Mr. Crowley and his predecessor in Congress, Thomas J. Manton, the party chairman in Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaffrey and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, met with Mr. Manton yesterday, when, according to officials close to Mr. Vallone, Mr. Vallone pressed Mr. McCaffrey to withdraw his bid.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaffrey, a member of the Council since 1985, entered the Democratic race against Mr. Crowley in February; he has also led a chorus of Queens Democrats in criticism of Mr. Manton and Mr. Crowley since 1998. They were angered over Mr. Manton's resignation from Congress too late to allow a primary, enabling him to pick Mr. Crowley for the Democratic slate in the Seventh Congressional District.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Crowley's selection, Mr. McCaffrey, City Councilman John D. Sabini and Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan expressed interest in running for the Seventh District seat. But they struck a deal to support whoever appeared to be the strongest candidate. Ms. Nolan conceded to Mr. McCaffrey last year, and Mr. Sabini did so in February.</p>
        <p>The impact on Mr. McCaffrey's political prospects was unclear yesterday. Regarded by many of his Democratic colleagues as one of the most articulate and well-liked Council members, he is one of 35 on the 51-member City Council who must relinquish their seats next year because of term limits.</p>
        <p>Naomi Bernstein, a spokeswoman for the city's Board of Elections, said that questions about Mr. McCaffrey's campaign finances might be taken up by the board at its weekly meeting on Tuesday. She said he could face censure by the board, which could potentially prohibit him from running for office in the future. But she added that it was unclear whether the use of political contributions to pay for car services that are necessary to fulfill the obligations of political office violated the rules of campaign finance. ''This could simply be a case of sloppy accounting,'' she said.</p>
