        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have been an admirer of Amos Oz for some years now. Reading his July 28 Op-Ed article certainly evoked my emotions, especially since I am for peace and made my own peace long before the statesmen did. I lived with Israelis and have befriended many of them.</p>
        <p>What was perplexing was Mr. Oz's interpretation of the ''right of return'' as the liquidation of Israel by Arabs. Right of return is the right of Palestinian refugees in Lebanese and Jordanian camps to have a normal life, a place they can call home, that will bestow on them a sense of belonging.</p>

        <p>My grandfather Adel al-Taji's home in Ramla is vacant. Why should he be deprived of having some form of closure?</p>
