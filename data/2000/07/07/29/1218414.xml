        <p>When Russia began picking apart its economy in 1992, Oleg Nasobin spotted an opportunity. After 70 years of Soviet deficits, his country was brimming with pent-up demand for lipstick, face creams and body lotion. It was a business opportunity he could take up only by leaving.</p>
        <p>That year, Mr. Nasobin packed his family off to Prague. He was looking to build a business on safe ground, away from the constantly shifting turf of Russia's early days of capitalism. He also was leaving his home -- the place that would later make him a wealthy man.</p>
        <p>''We left carrying two suitcases,'' said Mr. Nasobin, a 33-year-old former peddler of ginseng. ''It was a very grim situation in Russia in those days -- no personal prospects in sight.''</p>
        <p>Now his company, Green Mama, is one of Russia's top five cosmetics producers. Since starting the company in the Czech Republic in 1996, Mr. Nasobin and his wife, Irina, have expanded sales to 36 countries including the United States and Canada, and employ about 500 people. They later moved the factory to France and two years ago began some production in Russia. The pair hit upon a winning recipe: homegrown extracts with a made-in-France label that increased allure in a market still curious about foreign goods.</p>
        <p>Imports flooded Russia's cosmetics market after the fall of Communism in 1991. Kiosks were crammed with deodorant, face cream and shampoo with brightly colored English labels. Local residents, starved for foreign brands, snapped up everything from detergent to candy bars.</p>
        <p>But locally produced cosmetics have made a comeback since the country's 1998 currency devaluation. The weaker ruble drove up the price of imports, which became too expensive for locals to afford. Domestic car sales boomed while some foreign food and beverage makers were pushed out of the market altogether. Advertising on city billboards, television and radio changed from flashy foreign images to familiar designs and scenes.</p>
        <p>Russian-made cosmetics are especially popular outside of Moscow in Russia's vast regions, where average salaries are much lower. Last year, Russian-made shampoo in the regions held 39 percent of the market, up from 17 percent in 1998, according to ACNielsen, an international market research firm. Local face-care products -- one of Green Mama's biggest sellers -- rose to 83 percent of the market outside Moscow last year, from 68 percent the previous year, according to the researcher. Locals' market share was lower in Moscow where imports still dominate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasobin's treasure is face cream, body lotion and shampoo. The plastic tubes and bottles are dotted with sketches of flowers, plants and berries and are named Taiga Formula after the vast forests of central and northern Siberia. Extract of sea buckthorn, a bright yellow Siberian berry, colors a new face cream. Ribwort, a Russian roadside weed, makes face masks green. A new line of larch sap lipstick has just been released.</p>
        <p>The familiar ingredients are appreciated by Russian buyers, who over the last decade have had their fill of foreign-made products they say are packaged alluringly but just do not measure up to Russian items. Even before the ruble's collapse drove up prices on imports, buyers had already begun to turn away from many foreign products, seeking familiar brands of ice cream, soap and hand lotion. Green Mama, though made mostly in foreign factories, plays on that nostalgia.</p>
        <p>''I like the way it smells,'' said Valentina Surkova, a 43-year-old accountant who grew up in eastern Siberia and now lives in Moscow. ''Sea buckthorn berries -- this is my childhood.''</p>
        <p>Competition is intense, as local producers scramble to find a niche in the market space that has been created by the currency devaluation's impact on imports. Green Mama ranks third and fourth among local sellers of face-care and body-care products, its biggest selling items, according to Nielsen. However, sales are far below its biggest domestic competitor, Kalina, a company based in the Ural Mountains. Large foreign companies, like Beiersdorf of Germany, maker of Nivea cream; Proctor &amp; Gamble; and L'Oreal occupy about half the market, according to the Russian Perfume and Cosmetics Association. The association, a group of about 60 local producers, was formed five years ago to monitor trends in Russia's cosmetics industry.</p>
        <p>Russian women like to preen. Beauty care product sales this year will exceed $3.5 billion, according to the Perfume and Cosmetics Association. That is up from $3.2 billion last year, and includes sales of major foreign producers.</p>
        <p>After decades of fitting the image of a factory worker dressed in a shapeless smock and head scarf, women these days meticulously accentuate their femininity. A traveler to Moscow today would be hard pressed to spot unlaquered fingernails or bare lips in a crowd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasobin said he did not believe in marketing. He avoids expensive national advertisements and gets the word out mainly through local newspapers, radio and television. But the lack of aggressive advertising also has helped limit Green Mama's share of the market. Its annual sales total about $20 million, compared with the $90 million in sales by Kalina, which also sells household cleaning supplies produced at its factory in the Siberian city of Omsk.</p>
        <p>The son of a schoolteacher, Mr. Nasobin grew up in Yekaterinburg, the town in the Ural Mountains where former President Boris N. Yeltsin rose to fame. In the late 1980's he made his first forays into capitalism in the eastern port city of Vladivostok, where he bought Chinese ginseng from local traders. His wife and two small children live in France, but his parents and extended family have stayed in Russia.</p>
        <p>The Russian-foreign duality that has helped shape Mr. Nasobin's personal story is also reflected in his attitude about the future of his business.</p>
        <p>Though foreign countries helped Mr. Nasobin prosper, they also have crimped his company's development, he said in an interview in his central Moscow office, wedged between a cigarette factory and a Soviet-era clock maker.</p>
        <p>Green Mama, named for a drawing Mr. Nasobin's son made of his wife dressed to go out in green jewelry, has received unfair treatment simply because it is Russian, Mr. Nasobin said. Last year, foreign banks closed his company's accounts without explanation after United States authorities began investigating charges of Russian money laundering through the Bank of New York, though the company was not linked to the inquiry. As the investigation gathered momentum, banks tightened security for Russian companies and citizens.</p>
        <p>''We brought our business to its feet abroad -- if we had been based inside Russia this whole time, we would never have been able to do the same thing,'' he said. Still, he said, ''there's a bad image of Russians abroad,'' adding, ''I often have to explain that I also eat with a fork and knife.''</p>
        <p>Nor has he been able to persuade a foreign bank to give him a loan. He diverts a small amount from profit each year to help the business grow. That makes expansion slow, though he said he would prefer a bank loan to a partner.</p>
        <p>Next year, Mr. Nasobin said, he plans to expand Russian operations, which now pump out only the simplest of products, shampoo. The French factory is set to buy new equipment with some of last year's savings, and the Russian factory will inherit its used machinery.</p>
        <p>More Russian production will also help cut costs. Russian workers are paid about $300 a month, while company employees in France make an average of $3,500.</p>
        <p>Still, business in Russia has its problems. Heavy taxes weigh on profits and property rights are not always protected. Mr. Nasobin is embroiled in a struggle with local authorities in a small town near Ryazan in central Russia over a ceramics factory he has leased. He has organized Green Mama's Russian operations as a series of small companies, registered separately, in order to help insulate the business from threats of seizure in any possible property disputes.</p>
        <p>Nor is finding supplies easy. Green Mama has an in-house furniture maker, clothing producer and a packaging plant to ensure supplies.</p>
        <p>For now, Green Mama will remain Russian with a French address, just like Mr. Nasobin's children. But that will change, he said.</p>
        <p>''I migrated; I didn't emigrate,'' he said. ''We need to decide where Russia should go from here.''</p>
