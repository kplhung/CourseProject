        <p>Brimming with confidence, Gov. George W. Bush flew into President Clinton's home territory today, proclaiming that he intended to contest areas that the Democrats won solidly in the last two presidential elections.</p>
        <p>With his stop in the rolling green farm country in the northwest corner of Arkansas, Mr. Bush began a five-day march to the Republican National Convention that will take him through the highly contested states of Missouri, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In the district where a young Bill Clinton lost a race for Congress at the age of 28, Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were greeted by a roaring crowd packed into a high school auditorium and chanting a football fight cheer. Dozens of children were arrayed on the stage behind them and a banner proclaimed, ''Renewing America's Purpose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush pointed to two local boys-made-good -- Senator Tim Hutchinson and his brother, Asa, the congressman who gained renown as one of the impeachment managers who prosecuted Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''They whispered something in my ear that made Dick Cheney and I feel really great,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They told us we're going to carry Arkansas next fall. They told us not to worry about the last two election cycles. Something else is taking place in this state.''</p>
        <p>''It buoys my heart,'' he told the cheering crowd. ''It buoys my spirit to know as we're working our way to Philadelphia for the national convention, and we're working our way across battleground states that the Republican ticket has not been able to carry for the last two elections.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney took turns taking shots at the integrity and trustworthiness of the president, who was impeached, but later acquitted for his efforts to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. Neither man mentioned impeachment directly or even Mr. Clinton's name, but again and again they harked back to the Lewinsky scandal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney said he and his running mate were ''on a great crusade to restore dignity and integrity to Washington.'' And as the crowd cheered he called Mr. Bush ''the man who is going to give our kids and our grandkids a government we once again can be proud of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush praised Mr. Cheney in turn, and in the process took a shot at Mr. Clinton for his effort to sidestep questions about Ms. Lewinsky. ''This man is a good man,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Cheney. ''He's a solid man. He's a man who understands what the definition of is is.''</p>
        <p>At one point out in the audience, someone thundered, ''No more Slick Willie.''</p>
        <p>As he began his swing into the Republican convention, Mr. Bush had some good news -- two new polls showing him in the lead. Even in Arkansas, a Mason-Dixon poll just last week showed Mr. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore, 46 to 40 percent. It had a four-point margin of error.</p>
        <p>The Democrats kept up their assault on Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as the ''big oil dream ticket,'' and circulated a Reuters report from 1999 saying that Mr. Cheney, the chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a worldwide oil services firm, had praised an OPEC decision to cut oil production.</p>
        <p>Karen Hughes, Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, said that Mr. Cheney had been speaking at a conference of industry analysts and telling them of projections by economists that OPEC would cut production and that the ''price situation'' for the industry would improve.</p>
        <p>''Unlike the Clinton-Gore administration, he was not caught napping about OPEC's actions,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>From the moment he came aboard his campaign plane this morning, with his wife, Laura, Mr. Bush seemed relaxed and in good spirits. He ambled down the aisle joking with reporters and anticipating his nomination speech next Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I'm really looking forward to this speech,'' Mr. Bush said. ''This is going to be an unbelievably interesting moment in my life -- to walk out on that stage and to speak from my heart for however long it takes to get through the speech.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign has worked hard to plan a feel-good Republican convention with none of the sharp conservative edges of the past. The evening proceedings will have star turns for nonpoliticians -- a single mother, a teacher, a union member, a grandmother and granddaughter.</p>
        <p>On Monday and Tuesday nights Mr. Bush will be beamed by satellite into the convention from places around the country. He is to arrive in Philadelphia on Wednesday morning at a Latin American music festival, symbolic of Republican efforts to reach out to Hispanics.</p>
        <p>And on Thursday night one of the speakers welcoming him will be a Democrat, Jan Bullock, the wife of the late Lt. Gov. Ray Bullock of Texas, a Democrat who worked closely with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Even today on what was supposed to be a partisan tour, Mr. Bush tried to soften the tone. Before his rally he toured the Jones Center for Families, a community center founded by a family that ran one of the nation's largest trucking businesses.</p>
        <p>''We're here to hear and see and feel first hand the acts of this particular platoon in the armies of compassion,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>As he took a quick tour of the center's computer operation, one of the first people to greet him was Charles A. Huffer, who tightly gripped the governor's hand and began speaking. Mr. Bush looked bewildered and brushed him off quickly.</p>
        <p>''I told him that I thought he had a good chance to be president,'' Mr. Huffer, 61, said later, ''and I asked him if he would be willing to finally tell the American people the truth about unidentified flying objects.''</p>
