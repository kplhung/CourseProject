        <p>MELVIN MORA leaned against a gray wall in Shea Stadium yesterday afternoon, holding up the wall, bracing himself.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Mora learned that he had been traded to the Baltimore Orioles along with Mike Kinkade, Lesli Brea and Pat Gorman for Mike Bordick.</p>
        <p>The normally unflappable Mora had a pained look on his face. This one hurt.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't ready for this,'' he said. ''I didn't know they were going to trade me.''</p>
        <p>Certainly Mora had to sense something was up. Ever since Rey Ordonez fractured his forearm in May there were calls for everyone from Joe Tinker to Barry Larkin. Mora was tossed into the fire at shortstop and turned in mixed results: a stronger bat than Ordonez, a weaker glove. He was learning on the job but he wasn't learning fast enough.</p>
        <p>This is one of those classic cases of a team not being able to wait.</p>
        <p>Mora said, ''You play more and more and more, you're going to get better, better, better.''</p>
        <p>The Mets didn't, and do not have the luxury of time.</p>
        <p>Mora's problem is that for all of last year's heroics and versatility, the Mets never saw him as an everyday player. They saw him as an everyway player. He played second base, third, shortstop, center field, left and right.</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, introduced the trade yesterday by saying, ''Utility infielder, Melvin Mora.''</p>
        <p>''I love Melvin Mora,'' Phillips said. ''He's a very good player and a very versatile player. Melvin did the best he could.''</p>
        <p>But the new guy, Bordick, is a solid, everyday shortstop.</p>
        <p>''He makes all the routine plays,'' Phillips said, ''and oftentimes the spectacular play. He gives us the stability we were lacking.''</p>
        <p>Mora talked a lot about his relationship with Valentine.  He praised the manager for giving him an opportunity, for talking to him about the facts of life in baseball.</p>
        <p>''He's the one who told me baseball is hard,'' Mora said. ''He was the one who was always right behind me every time. When he said something was going to happen, it happened. He never lied to me.''</p>
        <p>Valentine didn't tell Mora that he was going to be traded, though when critics were sniping, Valentine reminded Mora that this was New York and this was a pennant race.</p>
        <p>''With a guy like Melvin,'' Valentine said, ''the most difficult thing he had was this idea that he had never been in the big leagues before, he had never been a full-time shortstop before and people wanted to hold him to a standard that was unlike the standard they held Rey to his first year as a shortstop.''</p>
        <p>Mora wondered why he couldn't have the same room to learn from his mistakes, the same latitude. Valentine had to explain to Mora that that was then, this is now. The higher expectations, which Mora helped to raise during last season's playoffs, narrowed everyone's margin of error.</p>
        <p>''The conversations we had were just the idea of understanding that life and our life in baseball is not always fair, and don't expect it to be fair,'' Valentine said. ''That was hard for him to understand. He's not the pennant race. He's Melvin Mora. All he is is this player out there learning this position, playing shortstop.''</p>
        <p>Valentine added that the Mets wanted to act sooner rather than later. ''If we lost anything during the time Rey Ordonez was hurt and now, it was not seen by the naked eye,'' Valentine said. ''If we would have lost some more between now and the end of the season, it might have been blatant, and the concern that everyone had over that possibility triggered this. And this is a good move to eliminate that doubt.''</p>
        <p>For the Mets this was a day of trade-offs: heart-and-soul player for rock steadiness. Melvin Mora has been around the baseball world and back.</p>
        <p>''This is just one more thing,'' Mora said. ''One more challenge. Here, I go to another place and make myself ready to show a lot of people that I'm an everyday player.''</p>
        <p>You heard a lot about stability last night at Shea Stadium. Not excitement. Not inspiration. Stability at short.</p>
        <p>The Mets made the right move on paper -- a no-brainer, as they say -- but much of what a Melvin Mora brings to the game cannot be measured in a box score.</p>
        <p>But come the playoffs in October, when the outcomes of series are often determined by intangibles, we'll see how good the trade looks then.</p>
