        <p>L'Unita, once the most powerful leftist newspaper in Italy, published what was probably its last issue today, a victim of the fall of the Berlin Wall and market forces.</p>
        <p>The front page carried a blurred picture of its maiden issue of Feb. 12, 1924, above a poignant editorial by the editor in chief. ''We are dying of debts,'' wrote the editor, Giuseppe Caldarola. ''We are dying of an insane financial crisis. But can so vital a part of the history of the left die this way?''</p>
        <p>The newspaper, which went into receivership two weeks ago but was unable to reach agreements with potential buyers, formally ''suspended'' publication. It expressed the hope that in the fall some solution can emerge to rescue the newspaper, which has a debt of $33 million, 123 journalists and a support staff of 70, and a hemorrhaging circulation of about 50,000. The Democratic Party of the Left, which split from the hard-core Communist Party in 1991 and is now Italy's largest center-left party, said it would try to find a way to salvage the newspaper.</p>
        <p>Other politicians and intellectuals mourned the likely passing of an Italian institution.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1924 by Antonio Gramsci as the mouthpiece of the Italian Communist Party, L'Unita was at the forefront of anti-Fascism before World War II and was forced to publish underground irregularly for the last years of the war.</p>
        <p>L'Unita returned to the newsstands in 1944 after the Allies liberated Rome from German occupation. The newspaper reached its zenith during the radical chic of 1970's, when it was the most closely heeded voice of opposition to the governing center-right Christian Democratic Party, selling as many as a million copies on May 1, the international labor day.</p>
        <p>It was also the training ground for generations of Italian politicians. Massimo D'Alema, who became Italy's first, if short-lived, former Communist prime minister, was the editor of L'Unita in the late 1980's. Walter Veltroni, who is the leader of the Democrats of the Left, was one of his successors.</p>
        <p>In 1997 L'Unita entered the private sector when the party sold most of its shares to private investors.</p>
        <p>As bankruptcy loomed earlier this year, the newspaper returned to direct party management, and Mr. Veltroni said the party was spending $1 million a month on it.</p>
        <p>In a related symptom of the decline of the left's strength in Italy, the Democrats of the Left are moving out of their historic headquarters on the Via delle Botteghe Oscure in central Rome, an address that for decades carried leftist mystique. In the fall the party will move to less expensive offices on the Via Nazionale.</p>
