      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Ben Stein, who offers his humorous take on why Republican Party has chosen gritty, urban, old-fashioned Philadelphia as site for its national convention, and Democratic Party has chosen glamorous Los Angeles, center of universe of sybaritic fantasy-making (M)</p>

        <p>War is the continuation of politics by other means. Clausewitz said that.  Politics is the continuation of show business by other means. I said that, but it might just as well have been said by Julius Caesar or Napoleon or F.D.R. or even my former boss, Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>You have to keep that in mind when you ponder why the G.O.P. is meeting in, of all places, gritty, urban, old-fashioned Philadelphia, while the Democrats gather two weeks later in glamorous Los Angeles, center of the universe of sybaritic fantasy-making. (Actually, the downtown part of Los Angeles is far grittier than downtown Philly, but just a few miles away are the lavish palm-fringed boulevards of Beverly Hills, while just a few miles from downtown Philadelphia is, well, not Beverly Hills, where magic is made and dreams come true.)</p>

        <p>War is the continuation of politics by other means. Clausewitz said that.  Politics is the continuation of show business by other means. I said that, but it might just as well have been said by Julius Caesar or Napoleon or F.D.R. or even my former boss, Richard M. Nixon.</p>
        <p>You have to keep that in mind when you ponder why the G.O.P. is meeting in, of all places, gritty, urban, old-fashioned Philadelphia, while the Democrats gather two weeks later in glamorous Los Angeles, center of the universe of sybaritic fantasy-making. (Actually, the downtown part of Los Angeles is far grittier than downtown Philly, but just a few miles away are the lavish palm-fringed boulevards of Beverly Hills, while just a few miles from downtown Philadelphia is, well, not Beverly Hills, where magic is made and dreams come true.)</p>
        <p>To understand why the conventions are the way they are, and why the G.O.P. chose Philly, we might think of the conventions as a movie. The Democrats' movie is lush: Al Gore and Bill Clinton soar into town on Air Force One and Two and sweep into the homes of Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg in long processions of limousines, and then the crown passes from Mr. Clinton to Mr. Gore in downtown's Staples Center while klieg lights illuminate the liquid Southern California sky. It's a pleasant image, and it's O.K. for a TV movie of the week. But where is the drama? Where is the ''arc,'' as we say? Mr. Gore goes from a mansion on Observatory Circle off Massachusetts Avenue to mansions in Malibu? That's no arc.</p>
        <p>The G.O.P. (I hope, I hope) has it figured out a lot better. In a variant of ''Road Warrior'' or maybe ''Alien,'' a group of party stalwarts from Boise and Salt Lake City and Jackson and Dallas and Kennebunkport is dropped down in the middle of that same gritty Philadelphia. The landscape is completely foreign. Little by little, savage road attackers -- ecoterrorists, spiky-haired anarchists and anti-globalists in heavy makeup -- gobble up the delegates. But then out of nowhere  (hey, this is even better than ''Road Warrior''!) down sweep Batman and Robin (Dubya and Dick Cheney) in a giant S.U.V. from George W.'s ranch! Using their good character and armor against divisive political tactics, they blow their attackers away.</p>
        <p>To make it better, we throw in a generous slice of ''Rocky,'' the ultimate movie of Philadelphia and the redemption of the underdog. After Dubya and Dick Cheney have frightened off the first group of attackers, they think they are safe, and start to unwind with some Tex-Mex food and beer. But when they leave the tavern, they're quickly surrounded by Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader and a howling mob of environmental protectionist agitators. Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have to battle against unheard-of odds to get through (think of Richard Nixon besieged in Caracas in 1958 or maybe of those little children lost in the forest in ''Hansel and Gretel'') to make it back to the convention, which has been moved to the front of the Philadelphia Art Museum.</p>
        <p>They break free of the pursuers, and then, to the soaring music of ''The Whiffenpoof Song,'' dance around and shadow-box before they go inside to the exultation of the masses of delegates. As an exhausted but defiant Governor Bush takes the stage, he turns his head and bellows, ''Noooo inheritance tax. . .'' and the G.O.P. goes wild. (It even sounds a little like ''Yo, Adrian. . .'')</p>
        <p>I'm telling you, I was a bit mystified when the party chose Philadelphia. But now that I understand, I'm down with it. The dramatic arc takes us right through to Inauguration Day. And think of the sequels.</p>
