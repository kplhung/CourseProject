        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: GUERRILLAS FREED  Eighty-six hardened guerrilla fighters walked free from prison in the last wave of 428 early releases of convicted bombers and killers mandated by the Northern Ireland peace accord. The Maze prison, home to 1,800 inmates during the years of sectarian violence that claimed more than 3,600 lives, was left with only 15 prisoners and is to be closed by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: WEAPONS FROM CROATIA  A haul of rocket-launchers, plastic explosives and other weapons confiscated in Croatia was destined for renegade republican paramilitaries trying to bring down the Ulster peace settlement, the heads of Ireland's police force and the Royal Ulster Constabulary confirmed. One of the splinter groups, the Real I.R.A., was responsible for the car bomb attack on Omagh two years ago that killed 29 people.</p>

        <p>LEBANON: DEPLOYMENT HALTED  United Nations peacekeepers began taking up positions on the Lebanese-Israeli border, extending their presence over the zone abandoned by Israel in May. Witnesses saw peacekeepers move into two border areas, but a United Nations spokesman said later that further troop movements had been frozen. He gave no further details.</p>

        <p>UNITED NATIONS</p>
        <p>PEACEKEEPER KILLING  The peacekeeper killed in East Timor on Monday was mutilated by pro-Indonesian gunmen, the United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said. He said the United Nations administration in East Timor ''has acknowledged that there were some signs of mutilation on the body.'' The soldier, Leonard William Manning, 24, a private of the Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, was on a patrol in the Suai border area when he was shot. He was the first United Nations soldier to die in combat in East Timor.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: BAN ON REBELS SOUGHT  Citing a new British terrorism law, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry formally asked Britain to ban the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a separatist group battling for a Tamil homeland. The Tigers, who have their international headquarters in London, are banned in India. The United States State Department has listed them as a terrorist organization.</p>

        <p>INDIA: STEPPING BACK IN KASHMIR  A senior army official, Maj. Gen. Basant Singh, told reporters in Srinagar that the army has cut back its operations in Kashmir since one of the major militant groups, Hizbul Mujahedeen, declared a three-month cease-fire on Monday.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: TALIBAN ATTACKS  The Taliban launched a predawn air and ground assault against opposition forces in northern Baghlan province, an opposition spokesman said. At least 10 bombing raids were conducted over the opposition-held Nahrin district, 150 miles north of Kabul, the spokesman said. A strategic highway there is considered a key supply route for the anti-Taliban alliance.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: BAN ON POPPIES  The Taliban ordered a complete ban on growing poppies, the plants from which heroin is made. It was not clear what prompted the order, which was reported on Taliban-run Radio Shariat. In the past, the Taliban have refused to place a complete ban on poppy growing, saying they need foreign aid to help farmers grow alternate crops.</p>

        <p>JAPAN: ANOTHER CULTIST SENTENCED TO DIE  Kiyohide  Hayakawa, the 51-year-old former ''construction minister'' of the Aum Shinri Kyo cult, was sentenced to death by a Japanese court, which found him responsible for producing the Sarin gas that killed 12 people when it was released on crowded Tokyo subway trains in March 1995. Mr. Hayakawa is the third cult member to get the death sentence since late June.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: MARRIAGE RULING SOUGHT  British Columbia is asking the province's Supreme Court to declare that same-sex couples can marry. A gay rights group, Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere, is filing a supporting petition naming the federal government as a defendant. New federal legislation erased virtually all distinctions between same-sex and heterosexual unions. But it also defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman.</p>

        <p>SIERRA LEONE: FIGHTING DIES DOWN  A more robust approach by United Nations peacekeepers has led more rebels to disarm, a United Nations military spokesman said, adding that the country was now ''relatively calm.'' Under a 1999 peace plan, demobilization camps were set up to take in fighters from all sides. But only around 25,000 of an estimated 45,000 combatants had turned themselves in before fighting erupted again in May.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: CALL FOR A STRIKE  The country's main labor movement called for a general strike to pressure President Robert Mugabe to end violence against opposition supporters and to stop the occupations of white-owned farms. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which has broad support among the country's 1.2 million laborers, said a nationwide strike would begin on Wednesday.</p>
