        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin convened a meeting with Russian tycoons today to impress on them that he, ultimately, is the one who runs the country.</p>
        <p>At the end of the session at the Kremlin, some business leaders said they were prepared to forgo special treatment and abide by government rules -- if the Kremlin would create a fairer business climate.</p>
        <p>In return, they said, they had won Mr. Putin's assurance that they could hold onto their wealth and that their purchases of state property during the post-Soviet privatizations would not be overturned.</p>
        <p>''We received confirmation that the results of privatization won't be reviewed and that the development of Russian business is one of the state's top priorities,'' said Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the head of the Yukos oil company.</p>
        <p>Since his election in March, Mr. Putin has sought to strengthen the Kremlin's authority by downgrading the power of regional governors and the influence of business leaders over government policy.</p>
        <p>That contrasts with his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, who maintained close relationships with powerful business executives, allowing them to hold government posts.</p>
        <p>''Yeltsin's system relied on a spider web, and he was in the center,'' said Lilya Shevtsova, a senior associate at the Carnegie Foundation. ''Putin demolished this. He wants to be alone on the top of the hill.''</p>
        <p>In a country where the rule of law is more slogan than practice and there is no shame over conflicts of interest, however, it remains to be seen whether today's meeting signals a real turning point in rooting out corruption and favoritism.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether Mr. Putin is really prepared to challenge vested interests and clean up government or whether his intent is to make the tycoons subservient to himself and punish those who failed to support him.</p>
        <p>The more than 20 business leaders summoned to the Kremlin today included the heads of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, and of several major Russian oil companies as well as top bankers. But in a disquieting sign that politics still weighs heavily in the Kremlin's calculations, there were conspicuous absences.</p>
        <p>Among those not invited was Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the media tycoon who was briefly jailed before a criminal investigation into his dealings was dropped. Also missing was Boris A. Berezovsky, the media and oil magnate, who resigned from Parliament last week, charging that Mr. Putin was involved in a ''destructive'' campaign against business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has gone out of his way to put pressure on Mr. Gusinsky, whose television network has been critical of Russia's military campaign in Chechnya and was relatively independent in its coverage of the presidential election campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin opened today's session with a mild lecture. The tone was decidedly different from that of the Yeltsin administration, when Mr. Yeltsin would gently chide business leaders, play them against one another and seek their backing.</p>
        <p>''I want to draw your attention to the fact that you built this state yourself, to a great degree through the political or semi-political structures under your control,'' Mr. Putin said. ''So there is no point in blaming the reflection in the mirror. So let us get down to the point and be open and do  what is necessary to do to make our relationship in this field civilized and transparent.''</p>
        <p>Taking aim at the oil companies, the government this week began investigating why they are paying different tax rates. And at tonight's meeting, for the first time, Mr. Putin called the Sibneft Oil Company to task for not paying enough taxes.</p>
        <p>Up to now, Mr. Putin has not taken any action against Roman Abramovich, a friend of Mr. Yeltsin's family and a major Sibneft shareholder.</p>
        <p>The president also pointedly refused to offer amnesty to the businessmen for their excesses in amassing wealth in the chaos and legal vacuum that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
        <p>Many of the business leaders appeared to be on the defensive and took a conciliatory stance.</p>
        <p>Vladimir O. Potanin, chairman of the board of Interros, which controls Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest mining and metallurgical enterprises, has been particularly eager to seek an accommodation with Mr. Putin, especially after the Moscow prosecutor raised questions about the terms of the Norilsk Nickel privatization. ''Business finally understands that using loopholes in the law is not correct,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin said such questions would be answered only in the courts.</p>
        <p>Others, however, said the government still had much to do if it was serious about fighting crony capitalism. For instance, they said, it has to cut taxes to encourage compliance.</p>
        <p>''Until the tax rates are lowered, every businessman is a criminal,'' said Kakha Bendukidze, the new head of Uralmash, a heavy-equipment manufacturer whose previous president was slain in a contract killing this month.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Putin has the upper hand, some key issues remain unresolved, and the two sides agreed to meet again.</p>
        <p>Boris Y. Nemtsov, the former deputy prime minister and self-proclaimed economic reformer who helped organize today's session, insisted that the meeting marked a new period. Businessmen are prepared to be more responsible, he said, so long as their newly acquired wealth is respected by the state.</p>
        <p>''The oligarchs are fed up with being oligarchs,'' Mr. Nemtsov said. ''They just want to be businessmen and pay their taxes.''</p>
