        <p>The Bank of America Corporation announced yesterday that it would eliminate 9,000 to 10,000 jobs over the next year, or 6.7 percent of its work force, and use the savings to improve its Internet offerings, promote its brand name and improve services, especially for wealthy individuals and corporate clients.</p>
        <p>Middle-level and senior managers are expected to be the principal targets of the job cutback, along with workers whose jobs will be erased by new technology. With these new steps, roughly 34,000 jobs will have been eliminated at the bank since September 1998, when it was created by the combination of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco.</p>

        <p>The Bank of America Corporation announced yesterday that it would eliminate 9,000 to 10,000 jobs over the next year, or 6.7 percent of its work force, and use the savings to improve its Internet offerings, promote its brand name and improve services, especially for wealthy individuals and corporate clients.</p>
        <p>Middle-level and senior managers are expected to be the principal targets of the job cutback, along with workers whose jobs will be erased by new technology. With these new steps, roughly 34,000 jobs will have been eliminated at the bank since September 1998, when it was created by the combination of Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and the BankAmerica Corporation of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Those two cities remain the primary addresses for senior executives, but a spokesman at corporate headquarters in Charlotte, Robert L. Stickler, declined yesterday to say where the cuts would be made. ''They will really come across the franchise,'' Mr. Stickler said. The banking company now employs 150,000 people.</p>
        <p>Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, Hugh L. McColl Jr., in a statement announcing the plan, said: ''Our days of growth by merger and acquisition are behind us. For the most part, our merger transition work also is behind us.''</p>
        <p>The challenge now, Mr. McColl said, is to make the bank's management structure, the product of multiple mergers over the years, more efficient.</p>
        <p>The main interpreter of the new strategy to Wall Street yesterday was Kenneth D. Lewis, the bank's president and chief operating officer. Reducing management costs without alienating customers will be something of a final exam for Mr. Lewis, 53 -- widely seen as heir apparent to Mr. McColl, 65, who is expected to retire next year.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Lewis emphasized that the job cuts did not conflict with the bank's announced determination to increase  customer satisfaction. In fact, he said, some of the savings would be used to identify specific customer complaints and fix them.</p>
        <p>''For example, the bank gets a huge number of requests from customers who want a copy of their canceled checks,'' Mr. Lewis said. For each request, employees have to look the check up on microfilm, copy it and mail it to the customer -- a process that requires 800 people over all and still provides customers with a poor-quality copy that arrives days after the request.</p>
        <p>By investing in new imaging technology, Mr. Lewis continued, the bank can both eliminate 800 jobs and enable customers to look up canceled checks online or even at an automated teller machine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis acknowledged that making the strategy work ''is something I'm in charge of,'' but he said that Mr. McColl ''was very supportive of what we wanted to do.'' He declined, however, to comment on Mr. McColl's retirement plans.</p>
        <p>The rolling cutbacks at Bank of America will inevitably be felt in the economy of Charlotte, a city it has come to dominate, said C. W. Sealey, chairman of the finance and business law department at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. But ''so long as they don't slip too far,'' he said, ''the impact should not be too severe.''</p>
        <p>The bank spokesman, Mr. Stickler, said the company had a ''competitive'' severance plan to cushion job losses for management employees, who first began to hear rumors of the job cuts about two weeks ago. The bank expects to take a charge against its third-quarter earnings as high as $350 million, reflecting severance costs and other expenses in the plan.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts and institutional investors seemed to take the news in stride yesterday. On a sharply lower day in the market, bank stocks were particularly weak, reflecting investor concerns that bank profits would be hurt if a strong economy prompted the Federal Reserve to again increase interest rates. Despite that, Bank of America shares were stronger than most, closing at $46.50, down 25 cents. But that is substantially below the stock's intraday high of $76.375, which it reached in July 1999.</p>
        <p>The bank's top executives have reassured analysts that they still expect to meet their revenue and profit forecasts, said Ron Mandle, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. The bank expects revenue to grow 7 to 9 percent a year, with earnings per share increasing 12 to 15 percent annually.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Mandle, that would allow Bank of America to meet Wall Street's profit expectations for the current year -- $5.21 a share -- and perhaps exceed them next year, when earnings are now forecast at $5.76 a share.</p>
        <p>''They're really just changing the mix, not making absolute cuts,'' he added.</p>
        <p>At the top of the bank's new to-do list is to steer an additional $70 million into ''e-commerce initiatives'' in the next six months and speed the introduction of Internet technology at its offices and call centers. The bank, which serves 30 million households and two million businesses, currently has 14,500 branches in 21 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>The bank expects to reduce the number of branches by about 200 by the end of the year, Mr. Stickler said, but that entails closing 350 offices and opening 150 new branches in more promising locations.</p>
        <p>Another element of the new strategy involves investing more in investment banking operations at home, and in Europe and Asia, to serve business customers in 190 countries. Through a previous merger, Bank of America inherited the Midwestern corporate business of Continental Illinois Bank in Chicago, Mr. Mandle noted, and it continues to serve the corporate customers of the old BankAmerica and Nationsbank.</p>
        <p>Mr. McColl and Mr. Lewis also plan to promote the bank's brand more aggressively, through increased advertising, and to cater more energetically to high-income individuals by improving asset management services and opening 10 private banking offices in wealthy areas, especially on the West Coast.</p>
