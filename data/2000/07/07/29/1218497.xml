        <p>The Nets met with the free-agent shooting guard Ron Mercer yesterday at the Champion Center in East Rutherford, N.J., promoting the team's training complex and its plans for a new up-tempo, defensive-style game under the rookie coach Byron Scott, and then entertaining Mercer regally for dinner.</p>
        <p>''From our standpoint, yes, it went well,'' the Nets' president, Rod Thorn, said. ''But obviously Ron is being wooed by more teams than just us. He was in on a fact-finding mission.''</p>
        <p>The Chicago Bulls, the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics are Mercer's other suitors in advance of the National Basketball Association's free-agent signing period, which begins Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Nets will not make an offer, however, until they know how much money, if any, will be made available to augment the salary cap. They are still awaiting a decision from the league regarding disabled-player exceptions for Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles. Thorn said he expected the ruling Monday, and if the league grants one exception, it can free $3.8 million for negotiating with free agents like Mercer.</p>
        <p>But Thorn did not discount the possibility of re-signing the veterans Kendall Gill and Johnny Newman. ''We're very interested in signing Kendall,'' Thorn said of Gill, the small forward.</p>
