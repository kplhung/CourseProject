        <p>A Brooklyn jury convicted a volunteer Republican fund-raiser yesterday of obstruction of justice for covering up his role in an alleged plot to help three Korean-American families get their sons out of prison in exchange for more than $30,000 in contributions to Gov. George E. Pataki's 1994 election campaign.</p>
        <p>But the same jury did not reach a verdict on the question of whether the fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, actually promised his assistance in getting the imprisoned men released on parole in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge who presided over the two-week trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn said that the deadlocked campaign corruption charges would be heard at a new trial, to begin on September 18.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Yoo, a prominent New Jersey businessman who was often tapped to raise money among Korean-Americans in the New York region, stemmed from a two-and-a-half-year federal inquiry into accusations that Pataki officials used the promise of early parole to help fill the governor's campaign coffers. The prosecutors overseeing the investigation have repeatedly said there is no evidence that Mr. Pataki participated in or had knowledge of the various crimes alleged.</p>
        <p>But from the start, the trial had the veneer of scandal as several Pataki aides were mentioned in courtroom testimony and Mr. Pataki's own former campaign finance director, Patrick Donohue, was called to the witness stand, where he underwent a scathing cross-examination by the government.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, jurors who spoke about their deliberations after the verdict said no single piece of evidence had proved Mr. Yoo's guilt to them. Instead, some said they were persuaded of Mr. Yoo's guilt by a slow and steady compilation of the evidence.</p>
        <p>''The majority of the jury did find that the defendant was guilty of most of the corruption charges,'' said a juror from Queens who would provide only his first name, Jonathan. ''But we didn't think there was any really strong evidence there. It was more cumulative over the two weeks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Donohue, who was never charged in the case, presented the most intriguing testimony. The federal government contended that he was aware political favors were promised in exchange for campaign donations -- an allegation that he vehemently denied on the witness stand.</p>
        <p>At least two jurors, however, said  they were convinced that Mr. Donohue knew more about the alleged parole-for-contribution scheme than he admitted. ''Yeah, I think Donohue knew what was going on,'' said William, a juror from Brooklyn, who refused to give his last name.</p>
        <p>The government maintained throughout the trial that Mr. Yoo, 63, approached three Korean-American families from Queens at a series of fund-raising events before the 1994 gubernatorial election and said he could help get their sons out of jail if they contributed to Governor Pataki's campaign. The sons -- John Kim, Bo Young Chung and James Jhang -- were convicted of several violent crimes, including armed robberies and attempted murder. Mr. Kim was released on parole two years after the donations by his family were made.</p>
        <p>While the jury could not decide whether they believed the government's case on the influencing-peddling charges, they apparently believed that Mr. Yoo tried to conceal his dealings with Mr. Jhang's family. The strongest piece of evidence proving this, some jurors said, was a tape recording of Mr. Yoo telling Mr. Jhang's family to disguise some of the campaign donations as a personal loan to Mr. Yoo.</p>
        <p>Margaret Giordano, an assistant United States attorney who tried the case, said she was disappointed. ''But we're eagerly awaiting the retrial,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Nicholas DeFeis, Mr. Yoo's lawyer, said he saw the decision as something of a victory for his client. ''The jurors seemed to have rejected the corruption angle in the case entirely,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yoo, who sat throughout the trial with a sour, dispassionate look on his face, said outside the courtroom: ''They still have the wrong guy. This is racial.''</p>
        <p>He is likely to face less than a year in prison on the obstruction of justice charge, federal prosecutors said.</p>
