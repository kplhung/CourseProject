        <p>Bargemusic has done its self-appointed job so well for so long that it is too easy to take for granted. As has often been said, the room in a barge moored in Brooklyn under the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the best places in the city to hear chamber music. The acoustics are right and the scenic surroundings superb.</p>
        <p>Yet in the crush of a New York concert season, a critic can only look enviously at the schedule of fine performers passing through in two programs, four concerts a week, year-round. Renewing contact is invariably one of the joys of quieter times.</p>

        <p>Bargemusic has done its self-appointed job so well for so long that it is too easy to take for granted. As has often been said, the room in a barge moored in Brooklyn under the Brooklyn Bridge is one of the best places in the city to hear chamber music. The acoustics are right and the scenic surroundings superb.</p>
        <p>Yet in the crush of a New York concert season, a critic can only look enviously at the schedule of fine performers passing through in two programs, four concerts a week, year-round. Renewing contact is invariably one of the joys of quieter times.</p>
        <p>And there, on Thursday, were eminently reliable performers in an elegantly simple program. Mark Peskanov, a violinist; Toby Hoffman, a violist; and Nathaniel Rosen, a cellist, played Mozart's Divertimento in E flat (K. 563), and Paige Hoffman, a pianist, joined in Brahms's Piano Quartet in C minor (Op. 60)</p>
        <p>Mozartean paradox abounds in a work termed ''divertimento'' but propounding some of the mature composer's profoundest thoughts; a work reduced from the string quartet standard that nevertheless surpasses virtually any quartet of its time in expressiveness. The piece was written in 1788 for Michael Puchberg, a well-to-do friend whom Mozart constantly dunned for loans, and the composer himself played the viola part, with its sporting excursions in the Andante and in the first trio section of the second Minuet.</p>
        <p>The players here gave the work an intense and compelling reading, with Mr. Peskanov, grand in his emotiveness, effectively anchored by Mr. Rosen, more meticulous and lapidarian though hardly without passion. A listener had to wonder what awaited in the stormier Brahms.</p>
        <p>What awaited was a reading almost fierce in such intimate surroundings yet precisely to the point. This work, Brahms once wrote, ''would make the bluest day turn cloudy,'' and Thursday was already the cloudiest and wettest of evenings. Begun during Schumann's illness and Brahms's infatuation with Schumann's wife, Clara, the quartet was for a time known as the ''Werther,'' an identification with Goethe's heartsick suicidal hero that the self-dramatizing young Brahms only encouraged.</p>
        <p>The players set out every ounce of passion in the work and then some. It was tempting to think that their exertions in the coda of the first movement, and not waves from a passing boat, were rocking the barge.</p>
        <p>Some of the same performers can be heard tonight and tomorrow in other works: surely worth a try.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
