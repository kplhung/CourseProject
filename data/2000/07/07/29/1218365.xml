        <p>Re ''U.S. Recommending Strict New Rules at Nursing Homes'' (front page, July 23):</p>
        <p>Our objective as caregivers is providing quality care to the frail and elderly. We can all agree that increasing staffing levels is desirable. But we can't overlook the fact that severe cuts to Medicare and Medicaid have rocked the nursing care infrastructure.</p>
        <p>The government must recognize the difficulty of recruiting health care professionals because of the pay scales and challenging work environment, in the middle of a national labor shortage.</p>
        <p>The Department of Health and Human Services and the Health Care Financing Administration should join us in supporting a bill that allows the hiring of supplementary caregivers to assist certified nursing assistants. Such initiatives have worked superbly at the state level.</p>
        <p>CHARLES H. ROADMAN II, M.D.  Washington, July 25, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is president of the American Health Care Association.</p>
