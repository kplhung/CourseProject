        <p>Vincenzo Sarno, the ''little Maradona,'' was bored. The 12-year-old Italian is on the verge of signing away his professional rights to A.S. Roma, one of the top teams in Italy, but sitting still for an interview is not his idea of fun.</p>
        <p>He leaned over to Gaetano Mosca, the man who runs the soccer academy that Vincenzo attends in his hometown of Naples, and in Italian asked a simple question in an exasperated voice:</p>
        <p>''How many pages is he going to write?''</p>
        <p>Vincenzo is clearly tired of talking about his gift -- or rather, tired of hearing adults talk about it. He had already spent yesterday morning waiting for a quick appearance on CBS's ''Early Show,'' whose set was teeming with adults: Mosca; a publicist from F. A. O. Schwarz, which sponsored his trip to New York and a shopping spree at the store; the television crew filming a special about him for the Italian television show ''Zoom''; tourists; and Bryant Gumbel.</p>
        <p>For all that standing around, he got only a few minutes on the air, right before the weather. On the outdoor set on the corner of 59th and Fifth, a small aluminum goal had been erected on a mat of plastic grass. The cameras rolled, and he juggled the ball a few times with his feet with his back to the goal before turning and shooting. After that, the weatherman tried to engage him and Vincenzo halfheartedly shot one into the left side of the goal before the segment ended. All together, not too much more than a lot of 12-year-olds on your block could have done.</p>
        <p>Then the camera stopped. Vincenzo suddenly had a huge grin on his face, and the ball seemed agreeable to whatever he wanted it to do. The boy whose talents are reminiscent of the former Argentinian star Diego Maradona used his feet, thighs, chest, shoulders and head, and it seemed the ball would never hit the ground again. As professional scouts all over Italy would be happy to tell you, nobody on your block can do anything close to what Vincenzo can do.</p>
        <p>That is why his professional playing rights are the focus of serious negotiations -- and have been since he was 10. While it is fairly common for professional teams to pay large sums for the playing rights of 15-year-olds, Vincenzo's age has made his case controversial. When his first prospective deal, with Torino, hit the Italian press, cries of exploitation were sounded. That deal has since been abandoned, but at the ripe age of 12 he appears on the verge of signing with Roma.</p>
        <p>''For me, I don't see anything wrong with it,'' said Mosca, who owns the rights to Vincenzo's image for advertising purposes until the boy turns 18.</p>
        <p>''If a kid wants to play soccer, he should be able to. Vincenzo is a different case. He is naturally gifted, and right now he plays like he is 14 or 15. It feels like it is right.''</p>
        <p>Vincenzo shrugs and looks sheepish when talking about committing to a pro team at such an early age.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make a difference,'' he said in Italian. ''It is O.K.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of the controversy, Roma is very close to completing a deal that would pay the boy's family around $200,000, with millions more to come for Vincenzo when he turns 14, the age at which amateur players can be signed by pro teams. Then, at 16, he would begin playing for Roma's senior team unless another squad pays a transfer fee for his rights.</p>
        <p>If he does sign with Roma, the club plans to move Vincenzo, whose family lives in a poor section of Naples, to an exclusive boarding school in Rome and to supply an apartment for his three siblings and his parents. The team will also arrange a job for his father and pay for special care of Vincenzo's 5-year-old brother, who has Down syndrome.</p>
        <p>For Vincenzo, however, the game still seems to be the thing, not the press or the money or the things his skill might allow him to do for his family. He is hard-pressed to come up with other hobbies: television (on which he watches soccer), school (where he gets to play soccer), and Play Station (on which he devotes most of his time to soccer games) were the only answers he could muster.</p>
        <p>Those around him seem intent on turning that love of the game into a future.</p>
        <p>''If there is talent out there, regardless of age, it should be helped,'' Mosca said as the television crew and public relations people headed out to lunch.</p>
        <p>Vincenzo was lagging behind, kicking a ball around the F. A. O. Schwarz lobby, faking out the cameraman from ''Zoom'' with a wide array of moves. Earlier, fleeing the conference room, Vincenzo offered his take on the day's events: ''Playing soccer is more fun than sitting in a room and talking about it.''</p>
