        <p>Moni Maker, the richest harness horse in history, will be among nine entries in the $1 million Breeders Crown Trot tonight at the Meadowlands Racetrack. The 7-year-old daughter of Speedy Crown is the early favorite, along with her stablemate, Raffaello Ambrosio.</p>
        <p>Moni Maker is a two-time Horse of the Year and was victorious on July 14 in her first appearance at the Meadowlands this season after racing in Europe. This will be her second to last start in New Jersey, with her retirement looming later this year. She will be driven by Wally Hennessey from the ninth post position.</p>

        <p>Magician, second to Moni Maker earlier this month, figures to provide the stiffest test again, as will Fern, which is just $108 shy of $1 million in career earnings and will be driven by John Campbell.</p>
        <p>The race is one of three Breeders Crown events tonight, with nine pacers contending in the $440,000 Breeders Crown Pace. Galleria, the 1998 Breeders Crown champion, will head a field in the $332,500 Breeders Crown Mare Pace.</p>
