        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 22 news article about gentrification in Park Slope, Brooklyn, humanized a complex issue that is affecting many low-income communities of color across the country. Effective solutions exist to enable residents in danger of displacement to stay in their neighborhoods and take part in the economic benefits of revitalization.</p>
        <p>An emerging approach called equitable development emphasizes the positive effect of mixed-income communities, and helps residents to have a voice in decision-making and to acquire the skills and resources needed to stay anchored in their neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>Longtime residents are afforded the opportunity to buy homes, gain jobs at a living wage, and build community-based businesses. This approach is essential to maintaining the diversity and vitality of American communities.</p>
