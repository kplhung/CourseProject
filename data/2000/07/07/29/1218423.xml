        <p>Dan McDonald and Stewart Greenleaf, two veteran Republican state legislators, share a special reason for confidence in their efforts to oust Democratic incumbents from the United States House of Representatives this fall.</p>
        <p>For they are running in the two true ''swing'' House districts left in the United States, not districts that just look like juicy targets to the party on the outside, but districts that regularly switch from the control of one party to the other.</p>
        <p>Each of their districts -- Washington's First, where Mr. McDonald challenges Representative Jay Inslee, and Pennsylvania's 13th, where Mr. Greenleaf runs against Representative Joseph M. Hoeffel -- has changed hands three times in the 90's.</p>
        <p>It used to be that swing districts were the bellwethers of national politics, closely watched as the parties slugged it out with issues and insults election after election. But in the 1950's their numbers began to decline as parties receded in importance and candidates for Congress ran increasingly on their own, raising their own money and, once they were in power, inventing dozens of perks to help solidify incumbency.</p>
        <p>The vanishing swing district is one of the most telling examples of how the nature of Congressional election politics has changed. For all the talk of a momentous battle for control of the House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold an 11-seat majority, there is real competition in only a handful of districts -- fewer than three dozen.</p>
        <p>These two genuine swing districts, 2,800 miles apart, have a lot in common. Both are overwhelmingly white suburbs of broad lawns and shopping malls, where most adults have been to college. Both have above-average incomes and expensive houses. William H. Gates's $60 million house here, and the more prevalent sports cars on Seattle's streets, suggest that the Washington district is a little better off than the Pennsylvania one. In both places, issues like education, abortion and taxes are on people's minds.</p>
        <p>There is no simple reason why these districts in and around Philadelphia and Seattle have remained so competitive. Other constituencies with similar demographics and politics have settled into the hands of one party or the other. But the biggest cause may be the failure of the Republicans who won these seats back in the Gingrich Revolution of 1994 to stay in touch with their voters, hanging on in 1996 but losing in 1998.</p>
        <p>The single biggest reason for the decline of the old-fashioned swing district is the set of advantages the system gives incumbents. They can  overcome anything short of tidal waves in national politics. Thomas Mann, a Congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution, cited resources ''that allow members to present themselves in favorable light back home, everything from being able to raise the money to run active, visible campaigns, travel home on a regular basis with a subsidy and use their legislative positions for commandeering the attention of the local media.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps none of those advantages is as important as being able to help constituents -- finding a lost Social Security check, getting a visa for a relative to attend a wedding, arranging a long-forgotten medal for a veteran.</p>
        <p>The advantage most easily proven is financial: incumbents raise more  money. This month Mr. Inslee reported a campaign cash advantage of $955,551 to $546,891 for Mr. McDonald. Similarly, Mr. Hoeffel had $818,468 in the bank to Mr. Greenleaf's $440,334.</p>
        <p>But those advantages are unlikely to be decisive in a year when control of the House hangs in the balance. National party organizations and their front groups, along with special interests of all complexions, are expected to put total spending in the 30 or so most competitive House districts at around $5 million each.</p>
        <p>The edge that neither challenger can really combat was on display on a recent Saturday at the Acme Supermarket in East Norriton Township, Pa., where Mr. Hoeffel set up a table full of government -- not campaign -- literature and met constituents. Some came because of a government-paid mailing; others were just weekend shoppers. Several wanted help with tax problems. One wanted Mr. Hoeffel to persuade his insurance company to pay for a particular drug.</p>
        <p>Politics came up, too. Voters talked about gun laws and taxes on married couples. One woman wanted to change her registration to Democrat from Republican because Republicans tried to extend the patent on the allergy drug Claritin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inslee has been demonstrating another edge of incumbency, publicity. In recent weeks the Seattle newspapers have reported that he got the electronic-signature bill passed by adding consumer protections, that he was working on pipeline safety legislation after a fatal accident at Bellingham, Wash., last year, and that he was critical of the judge in the antitrust case against Microsoft, whose headquarters at Redmond is in his district, and whose employees contribute heavily to Mr. Inslee.</p>
        <p>One advantage the Democrat enjoyed two years ago is gone. In 1998, Bruce Craswell, a conservative third-party candidate, took 6 percent of the vote, just a bit more than Mr. Inslee's margin over Rick White, the Republican incumbent. Most of the Craswell votes came from Mr. White. Without him, the race would have been about even. This time Mr. Inslee is opposed only by Mr. McDonald, a powerful 22-year veteran of the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>On the stump, Mr. McDonald complains about Mr. Inslee's votes against tax cuts, says he wants local school boards to have more authority in spending federal money while giving them incentives to ease bureaucratic teacher certification rules. And Mr. McDonald, a Vietnam veteran, said he wanted to strengthen national defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonald said taxes and education would be the major differences between him and his rival. But he also said he had always voted to restrict abortions, an issue Mr. Inslee plans to attack him on.</p>
        <p>Every candidate here advertises his credentials as an environmentalist. Mr. McDonald and Mr. Inslee both addressed participants in a 110-mile hike from the Cascades to Puget Sound this weekend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inslee argued that campaign finance legislation, including a ban on unregulated contributions to parties was essential both to protect the environment and to protect personal privacy in an electronic age.</p>
        <p>Across the continent, in the suburban district that stretches from Philadelphia's Main Line out to Valley Forge and Abington, Mr. Greenleaf is also a soft-spoken but powerful state legislator. He emphasizes local school control, tax cuts and the ''flexible'' Republican drug plan, though on issues like the fear of a ''big boondoggle'' in the antimissile program or support for trigger locks on handguns he emphasized his moderate credentials -- underlined by his support for abortion rights.</p>
        <p>At a retirement home in Plymouth Meeting, Mr. Greenleaf said he had been recognized as ''effective'' in 24 years in the state capital, and would be the same kind of congressman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoeffel boasted of being ''socially progressive and fiscally responsible,'' and said his budgetary bona fides had been certified by the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group. And he argued that Republicans were captives of the pharmaceutical industry. He called for ''registration of handguns and licensing of handgun owners.''</p>
        <p>One advantage the two Democrats share is that they have both been through tough campaigns, winning and losing before. Neither Republican has ever had a real test.</p>
        <p>Both Democrats are trying to take their districts out of the ''swing'' category. Only one other district changed hands three times in the 90's, but that one, the First District in Northern California, now seems safe for its Democratic incumbent, Mike Thompson.</p>
        <p>But even if their districts turn out to be safe from this year's Republican challengers, they may not be secure for 2002 against the partisan vagaries of redistricting.</p>
