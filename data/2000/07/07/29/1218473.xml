        <p>A violent burglar who may have plundered several Upper West Side homes slipped into one early yesterday and viciously beat a 50-year-old businesswoman and her male companion with a heavy flashlight, leaving her in critical condition, the police said.</p>
        <p>The attack on the couple, Madelyn Simon and Dr. Leonard J. Simon, who had recently bought the stately Beaux-Arts town house on West 87th Street near Riverside Drive where the crime took place, followed six other similar incidents in the area, the police said. Detectives were trying to determine whether they were all the work of the same burglar.</p>
        <p>Investigators on the latest case were unsure how the burglar got inside the house about 2:30 a.m. There were no signs of forced entry. In the other cases, the burglar entered through open windows or doors.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's attack bore some similarities to a burglary early Monday on West 93rd Street near Central Park West in which an elderly couple was stabbed and beaten, said Capt. Robert A. Iovino of the Manhattan Major Crimes Squad.</p>
        <p>The similarities led detectives to look into earlier burglaries in the 24th Precinct, which covers the Upper West Side of Manhattan from West 86th Street to Cathedral Parkway, the captain said.</p>
        <p>They found five others in the precinct since June 25 that had occurred in the early morning at first-floor or basement-level apartments between West 87th Street and West 105th Street, the captain said. Five were near Riverside Drive and two were near Central Park West.</p>
        <p>''We didn't actually link all of these incidents,'' Captain Iovino said at a news conference at which a sketch of a suspect was released. But he said that detectives were comparing forensic evidence to try to determine if the attacks were the work of the same man.</p>
        <p>In the burglary yesterday, the police believe the intruder's movements woke up Dr. Simon, a 63-year-old psychologist who had moved into the home only about three weeks ago with Ms. Simon. The two coincidentally have the same last name although they are not married.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simon got out of his bed to investigate, saw a silhouette of a man in the hallway and was beaten unconscious, a police official said. The burglar then beat Ms. Simon, causing severe head injuries.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simon regained consciousness and called 911, Captain Iovino said. The police found Ms. Simon on the bed, her legs hanging over the side, as if she had been struck while sitting up, a police official said.</p>
        <p>Both were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where a spokesman, Andrew Miller, said Ms. Simon underwent surgery and both she and Dr. Simon were in the intensive care unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said that Ms. Simon was in critical condition and that Dr. Simon was in stable condition, but he would not discuss their injuries.</p>
        <p>A police official said doctors told detectives that Ms. Simon suffered severe injuries to her brain that caused it to swell and that doctors would be watching her closely over the next 48 hours in the hopes that the swelling would subside. Dr. Simon's daughter said her father had a fractured skull.</p>
        <p>The couple had previously lived in a loft on West 16th Street and had moved because they enjoyed the Upper West Side, said Dr. Simon's daughter, Arielle Simon, 20, a sophomore at Wellesley College.</p>
        <p>''They liked the neighborhood and have a dog and wanted to be near the park,'' said the doctor's daughter, who lives two blocks away. ''They asked me about the safety of the neighborhood. I told them it was fine.''</p>
        <p>Arielle Simon said she visited her father in the hospital yesterday and he told her he was eager to go home.</p>
        <p>She said the police had told her that the house had not been ransacked and that they believed nothing had been stolen except a pocketbook that investigators found in a trash bin on the block.</p>
        <p>A senior police official said that Dr. Simon had done contract work for the Police Department in the past. Madelyn Simon owns and runs a large Manhattan landscaping business that maintains indoor and outdoor plants for large corporations, serving about 700 businesses, according to business records. Before starting the company, Madelyn Simon &amp; Associates, she wrote for The Soho News and Family Circle magazine.</p>
        <p>One neighbor said Ms. Simon had recently planted magenta-colored flowers around a tree in front of the town house.</p>
        <p>One neighbor said the street had once had a neighborhood watch program and a private security guard, financed by the block association, but both had been ended.</p>
        <p>One neighbor, Tom Simpson, 54, said he heard a dog barking early yesterday and looked out his window to see paramedics putting Dr. Simon into the ambulance.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't get back to sleep,'' said Mr. Simpson. ''I was disturbed. This block has always been a very safe block, but it's New York. This type of thing could happen anywhere.''</p>
        <p>In the attack early Monday on West 93rd Street, the burglar awoke Wanda Rotz, 79, who saw him outside her bedroom door, the police said. She tried to close the door, and her husband, Nicholas Rotz, 78, came to her aid. During the struggle, Mrs. Rotz's wrist was broken and her husband was injured. The intruder fled with $300.</p>
        <p>Both are still hospitalized at St. Luke's-Roosevelt, where Mr. Rotz was listed in critical condition and his wife in stable condition, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Darryl Gregory, a public school music teacher who has lived in the building with the Rotzes for seven years, said he had never heard of any crime on the block.</p>
        <p>''This is the city reminding us where we live,'' he said. ''We've been lulled into a sense of complacency that everything is O.K. Obviously things aren't O.K.''</p>
