        <p>Gone are the lush blooms and biotica that flourished in Roberto Juarez's richly-wrought paintings. His current works are New York-based abstractions that play on the garish mix of buildings in the new Times Square along with elements from his recent paintings of Rome, now pared down to linear essence.</p>
        <p>True, the mosaics of loops, mazes, convoluted whorls and calligraphic writhings that characterize some paintings don't always make direct allusions. Some still suggest floral buddings, as in ''Caprice,'' whose orange skeins of lines sprout podlike endings. There are a few whose patterns are more evocative of geometric textiles or Roman tile floors, like ''New Building,'' in which gray and black triangles are framed by linear squares in an eccentric arrangement.</p>

        <p>Gone are the lush blooms and biotica that flourished in Roberto Juarez's richly-wrought paintings. His current works are New York-based abstractions that play on the garish mix of buildings in the new Times Square along with elements from his recent paintings of Rome, now pared down to linear essence.</p>
        <p>True, the mosaics of loops, mazes, convoluted whorls and calligraphic writhings that characterize some paintings don't always make direct allusions. Some still suggest floral buddings, as in ''Caprice,'' whose orange skeins of lines sprout podlike endings. There are a few whose patterns are more evocative of geometric textiles or Roman tile floors, like ''New Building,'' in which gray and black triangles are framed by linear squares in an eccentric arrangement.</p>
        <p>In ''Food Court'' rough concentric circles of white lines tipped with yellow rectangles spread out from a central core on a soft green ground to form a schematic sun disk. In this and other arresting works there is a contrast between the softness of the grounds -- blends of transparent and opaque materials in muted colors -- and their strong geometric-organic motifs.</p>
        <p>The biggest canvas, ''Times Square Tiles,'' suggests a huge, relaxed coil of beadwork made up of tiny black and white modules. It evokes strands of genetic material swimming in a primal soup more than it does Times Square. The liquescent effect comes from the pale ground of pink, green and other less distinguishable tonalities, skillfully laid down. These are strong paintings, a nice change in pace for Mr. Juarez.</p>
