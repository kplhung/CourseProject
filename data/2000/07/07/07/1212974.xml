        <p>The turning point of John Philip Sousa's life came in the late summer of 1880 when the Commandant of the Marine Corps asked him to become the next musical director of the United States Marine Band. This was a big break, of course. Yet Sousa was hesitant about it.</p>
        <p>Not quite 26 at the time, Sousa was working as a conductor, arranger and composer of musical theater works and was just then in St. Louis with a touring production of ''Our Flirtations,'' for which he had written most of the score. There were obvious reasons to quit the tour and accept the Marine Band job. Sousa had loved band music since his childhood in Washington during the Civil War, when military bands routinely paraded through the streets of the capital playing ''Tramp, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Are Marching'' and other rousing works. The Marine Band was the family business. Sousa's father, born in Spain to Portuguese parents, played trombone with it; and John Philip had spent seven adolescent years as an apprentice in the band, playing trombone, cornet, alto horns and sometimes cymbals. Finally, Sousa had an 18-year-old wife to support. This prestigious post would bring them stability.</p>
        <p>Still, Sousa feared that directing the band might end his career in the theater. His deep ambition was to find the right lyricist partner and become America's Gilbert and Sullivan.</p>
        <p>Of course, Sousa accepted the post, and so began the career that would soon lead the American public to proclaim him the March King, the composer of ''Stars and Stripes Forever'' and dozens of other first-rate marches that have long been icons of Americana. Yet Sousa kept composing for the theater, producing nine works that reached production and many more left unfinished. This side of Sousa's career has been undervalued, which is why attention will be on the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y., tomorrow night when the summer festival company, opening its 25th-anniversary season this weekend, presents ''The Glass Blowers,'' Sousa's last completed and most elaborate operetta.</p>
        <p>''The Glass Blowers'' has not been performed in anything close to its original version since its first production in 1913. For decades no complete performing edition of the work existed. But in 1991 a restoration of the score and script was finished by Jerrold Fisher, a conductor and arranger, and William Martin, a stage director, who, with the sanction of the Sousa estate, have been working together since 1982 to restore and publish Sousa's theater works. Their essentially two-person operation was incorporated in 1984 as Lyric Theater International.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Fisher is enchanted by Sousa's operettas was palpable as he talked about them during a recent joint interview with Mr. Martin in Manhattan. ''In its day, 'El Capitan,' which opened in 1896, was more popular in the United States, ran longer and drew larger crowds than 'H.M.S. Pinafore,' '' Mr. Fisher said. Mr. Martin pointed out that on Jan. 1, 1900, the night ''Chris and the Wonderful Lamp,'' Sousa's American retelling of the Aladdin fantasy, opened in New York, two other Sousa shows, ''El Capitan'' and ''The Charlatan,'' were also playing there. ''That's three shows running simultaneously on what was then Broadway,'' Mr. Martin said.</p>
        <p>When Paul Kellogg, the artistic director of Glimmerglass, working with Stewart Robertson, the company's music director, and the stage director Christopher Alden, expressed interest in presenting a Sousa operetta, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Martin showed them all four of the works they have restored to date, which include ''El Capitan.'' But ''The Glass Blowers'' was their strong favorite.</p>
        <p>It clearly fit with the Glimmerglass mission, as Mr. Kellogg explained during a recent phone interview from Cooperstown. The company has long championed neglected American works, and here was an ''absolutely sound operetta'' by a major American composer, Mr. Kellogg said, ''that had never been done in our lifetimes.'' Noting that many Sousa operettas take place in European never-never lands, Mr. Kellogg added, ''We wanted something that was specifically American, that represented the enthusiasm, the optimism, the social currents, the rhythms of America at the turn of that century.''</p>
        <p>''The Glass Blowers'' was certainly that. Set in 1898, the story opens in the Manhattan mansion of Colonel Vandeveer, a wealthy financier, whose vivacious and socialistic daughter Annabelle has been coyly resisting the amorous attentions of Jack Bartlett, a wealthy and snazzy young charmer. At the reception, a guest, Silas Pompton, the unscrupulous owner of Consolidated Glass Works, is trying to foster a marriage between his daughter, Geraldine, and an eligible young British duke. Naturally comic complications ensue.</p>
        <p>Though essentially a frothy operetta, the work satirizes labor-management disputes, stock market speculation and jingoism. Jack casts aside his wealth and goes to work in Pompton's glassworks to prove his mettle to Annabelle. And before the happy ending, the last act switches to a battlefront in Cuba during the Spanish-American War, where the male factory workers, now soldiers, and the female workers, now Red Cross nurses, sing an ardent choral ensemble.</p>
        <p>The original libretto and lyrics are by Leonard Liebling, a playwright and the editor of The Musical Courier. Liebling's lyrics were preserved in the piano-vocal score of the operetta, which was published by Sousa. But only patches of Liebling's dialogue existed. As best he could, Mr. Martin pieced together the fragments, some of which he found written in a cue book for the stagehand running the gas lighting. The rest he wrote himself, in the appropriate style. Mr. Fisher had a somewhat easier task restoring the music, since Sousa's original orchestra parts exist, as well as that piano-vocal score.</p>
        <p>That Sousa was so adept at orchestration and music theater composition may surprise those who think of him only as a march master. Actually, Sousa's primary instrument was the violin. A formative experience came in 1876 when Offenbach, visiting from Paris, conducted his operetta ''Les Bavards'' at the American centennial exposition in Philadelphia and Sousa, then 19, served as his able concertmaster. Steeped in the European masters of the 19th century, Sousa prepared elaborate arrangements of works by Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Wagner and others, first for the Marine Band and, after 1892, for his own John Philip Sousa Band, which toured internationally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher believes that of all Sousa's works, ''The Glass Blowers'' comes closest to fulfilling the composer's goal of creating a truly American opera. Sousa so badly wanted it to reach the stage that he approached the Shuberts, the famous theater producers, with an offer to cover half the estimated production cost of $30,000 himself. The Shuberts took a pass on the offer.</p>
        <p>But John Cort, a wealthy businessman with cultural aspirations who was trying to become a power in the theater world, agreed to produce it. ''The Glass Blowers'' opened in a rented Shubert theater in Rochester, on Jan. 27, 1913. The production then toured for four weeks through the American heartland and Southeast.</p>
        <p>The show must have been extravagant. During the Act II scene at the glassworks, actual furnaces were stoked onstage and glass blowers displayed their skills. The final act featured, for what may have been the first time in a theatrical production, film of battle scenes from the Spanish-American War. The entire production, including the iron furnaces, was lugged from town to town, sometimes for one-night stands. For example, on three consecutive days in mid-February the operetta played in Richmond, Ind., then Springfield, Ohio, then Dayton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>During the tour, in the venerable tradition of musical theater, the show was altered extensively. The earnest soprano who had been playing the lead role of Annabelle was replaced with a star, Louise Gunning. Naturally, her role had to be expanded. Even the title of the work was changed to ''The American Maid.''</p>
        <p>''With Gunning topping the cast, it became her show,'' Mr. Martin explained. ''Plus, everyone liked the meaning of the new title, as in 'American made,' which related nicely to the labor dispute in the story.''</p>
        <p>As ''The American Maid,'' the operetta opened at the Broadway Theater on 41st Street (no longer standing) on March 3, 1913. It played only 16 performances. By and large, the reviewers liked the music. ''The score is characteristically Sousa esque,'' wrote the critic from The New York World. ''It bristles with stirring march numbers and spirited ensembles.'' But Liebling's book was felt to be cumbersome and somewhat dated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher believes that this reaction must be understood in historical context. Sousa's ''Capitan'' and ''Charlatan,'' which date from the late 1890's, ''represented the epitome of the American musical'' back then, Mr. Fisher said. ''But by the time we get to 'The Glass Blowers,' musical theater had moved on,'' he added. This was the heyday of the Ziegfeld Follies. The season of ''The American Maid'' was the same season that Jerome Kern's ''Oh I Say!,'' billed as a ''riotous musical comedy,'' hit Broadway. Despite its social commentary, the patter songs, elegant choral ensembles and operetta fluff of Sousa's work must have seemed old-fashioned.</p>
        <p>But these very qualities may endear it to today's audiences, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Martin believe. The score contains some attractive and witty songs, like ''Cleopatra's a Strawb'ry Blonde,'' Geraldine's wry account of how Shakespeare would have to be updated to register with modern audiences.</p>
        <p>The lyrics are clever, if a bit stiff:</p>
        <p>The dramatist of yesterday was certainly a yap;</p>
        <p>He didn't cater to the mob, he knew not vim nor snap.</p>
        <p>The music is gently lyrical, with tinges of a cakewalk or ragtime. And for a simple song the harmonic writing is rich with sudden chromatic shifts of chords and keys. Naturally, the score also boasts a rousing march, ''From Maine to Oregon,'' which keeps recurring in different guises, the one number from the operetta that has found an independent life.</p>
        <p>Performed with all the materials that Mr. Fisher and Mr. Martin have discovered and included in their edition, ''The Glass Blowers'' would be over three hours of music and dialogue. So, in accordance with another revered tradition of the American musical theater, the show has been trimmed for the Glimmerglass production. Those who might object should remember that Sousa changed his theater stages according to the specific requirements of the theater, the production and the cast. There is no definitive version of ''The Glass Blowers.''</p>
        <p>Among the cast members at Glimmerglass will be Jeffrey Lentz as Jack, Maria Kanyova as Annabelle, Jennifer Dudley as Geraldine and Richard Whitehouse as the Duke. Unlike the original production, this one will include no real furnaces or live glass blowers, but the Corning glassworks company, about 100 miles west of Cooperstown and a longtime supporter of Glimmerglass, is still so excited about the subject matter that it is underwriting the production.</p>
        <p>The director, Mr. Alden, known for his vibrant if sometimes overactive imagination, promises audiences a lot of fun. Some visitors to his rehearsals have likened the production to a Busby Berkeley show. Mr. Kellogg compares it more to Brecht. ''It's probably somewhere in the middle,'' he said. New Yorkers who don't make it to Cooperstown will be able to judge for themselves when Mr. Kellogg, who also runs the New York City Opera, brings this co-production to Lincoln Center in a future season.</p>
        <p>However it turns out, Sousa would have been heartened by this revival. He yearned to be a success in the theater. Two years after accepting the Marine Band post, his operetta ''The Smugglers'' lost its entire investment during a short-lived tour and ''was buried in the vast dramatic cemetery of musical failures,'' as Sousa wrote in his 1928 autobiography. When the tour shut down in Philadelphia, Sousa, disconsolate, fled to his hotel room. ''I examined myself and could only see that I was a colossal failure as a composer, as a dramatist and as a man,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Before feeling too sorry for him, though, remember that within a few years the failed musical theater composer could drown his sorrows in the scads of money made by the March King.</p>
