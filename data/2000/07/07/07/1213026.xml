        <p>Negotiations have intensified between federal prosecutors and lawyers for James T. Riady, a friend of President Clinton and a prominent Indonesian businessman whose large campaign donations to Democrats have been scrutinized by investigators, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>After talks with the Justice Department's chief political-finance prosecutor, Robert J. Conrad Jr., Mr. Riady has been under pressure in recent days to accept a plea bargain, the officials said. Mr. Conrad has been investigating Mr. Riady's activities in connection with contributions made by employees of the Lippo Group, the Riady family conglomerate, in the 1992 and 1994 campaigns.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether Mr. Conrad has insisted that Mr. Riady plead guilty to a felony or whether he might accept a lesser charge and settle the case without a trial. But, the officials said, Mr. Riady is unlikely to accept any deal unless it includes a provision that would spare him a prison sentence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riady's defense lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, would not comment on the matter today.</p>
        <p>The inquiry into Mr. Riady heated up after John Huang, a Democratic fund-raiser and former Lippo employee with close ties to Mr. Riady, was sentenced in August 1999 to a year of probation in exchange for his cooperation in the inquiry. Mr. Huang pleaded guilty to engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission by arranging for Lippo employees to be reimbursed for campaign contributions in the 1992 and 1994 campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang, in an appearance before a House committee investigating campaign finance issues, testified that he knew of no wrongdoing by Mr. Clinton or Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Huang said Mr. Riady told him about a 10-minute limousine ride that Mr. Riady shared with President Clinton in the 1992 campaign.</p>
        <p>During the limousine ride, according to Mr. Huang's account, Mr. Riady promised to raise $1 million for the campaign. Mr. Huang said Mr. Riady told him that Mr. Clinton had been surprised by the offer. Mr. Riady had been a friend of the president since Mr. Riady's days as a trainee at a Little Rock investment bank when Mr. Clinton was governor of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Huang recalled Mr. Riady saying later that his approach to political giving was, ''If you are going to do something, don't do it small.'' President Clinton has said that he knew of nothing improper about the donations made by Mr. Riady and other members of his family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riady and his wife, Aileen, contributed $520,525 to the Democrats in 1992, election commission records show. Lippo and its employees gave the Democrats an additional $115,000 in 1992. Members of the Riady family also made large donations to state Democratic parties in 1992.</p>
        <p>Later, in September 1994, Mr. Clinton, Mr. Riady and Mr. Huang were seen in a White House videotape taken at a White House radio address, a weekly event that important supporters were sometimes invited to attend. After the address, Mr. Clinton is seen conferring with Mr. Riady and Mr. Huang. Little can be heard of their conversation, although Mr. Clinton at one point is heard to say, ''important issues,'' and at another time says, ''I think it will be big.''</p>
        <p>In times of trouble, the Riady family stepped in to help other Clinton associates. After Webster L. Hubbell left a high-ranking post at the Justice Department in 1994 in a dispute over billing records at his former Little Rock law firm, a Riady family company paid Mr. Hubbell a $100,000 consulting fee.</p>
        <p>Kenneth W. Starr, the former Whitewater prosecutor, investigated whether such fees totaling more than $500,000, from several firms, amounted to payments to buy Mr. Hubbell's silence about his knowledge of the activities of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary. Mr. Hubbell denied that the payments were hush money.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Mr. Riady told an interviewer that he had tired of the life of a high-flying entrepreneur and longed for a quieter life in school or at a Christian ministry. In the interview with Asia Inc. magazine, he said the Asian financial crisis had been a trying experience because of bank runs and riots in Indonesia in which one of the family's shopping malls was set on fire.</p>
