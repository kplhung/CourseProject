        <p>Tennis fans were left wondering (and sputtering) about when -- oh when? -- they would actually get to see the broadcast of the hot Wimbledon women's semifinal between Venus and Serena Williams on NBC yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>When NBC's four-hour taped broadcast of the matches began at 1 p.m., the Williams sisters were nowhere to be seen. Instead, NBC began its coverage with portions of Wednesday's men's quarterfinal between Pete Sampras and Jan-Michael Gambill.</p>
        <p>Not only was Sampras-Gambill a day-old offering whose result was already known, but viewers were also left in the dark as to exactly when coverage of the Williams-Williams semifinal would begin.</p>
        <p>Viewers were told that the day's ''featured match between the Williams sisters would be at the conclusion'' of the Sampras-Gambill quarterfinal. But the problem was ''the conclusion'' was a long time coming and tennis fans never knew when it would be: the Williamses finally took Center Court on NBC around 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>''What we were trying to do was have the largest audience for the second match,'' Cameron Blanchard, director of communications for NBC, said by telephone from London, ''and research indicates that the larger audience is available later in the afternoon. We wanted that match to be the Williams sisters because the match was so highly anticipated and the sisters have been such a big story.''</p>
        <p>So, why not show the women's semifinal between Lindsay Davenport and Jelena Dokic first? Blanchard said that TNT, which has worked in tandem with NBC to bring Wimbledon 2000 to American viewers, ''had Davenport'' for its telecast later yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We chose Sampras-Gambill first,'' Blanchard said, ''because many of our viewers hadn't seen it.'' But many of TNT's viewers had seen it -- on Wednesday.</p>
