        <p>SBC Communications plans to announce today the long-distance rates it will charge in Texas, the second state after New York in which a local phone company will also offer long-distance service.</p>
        <p>Starting on Monday, SBC will offer long-distance plans to individual and corporate customers that will compete with service offered by companies like WorldCom, AT&amp;T and Sprint. Verizon Communications, the former Bell Atlantic, entered the long-distance market in New York at the beginning of this year.</p>

        <p>SBC Communications plans to announce today the long-distance rates it will charge in Texas, the second state after New York in which a local phone company will also offer long-distance service.</p>
        <p>Starting on Monday, SBC will offer long-distance plans to individual and corporate customers that will compete with service offered by companies like WorldCom, AT&amp;T and Sprint. Verizon Communications, the former Bell Atlantic, entered the long-distance market in New York at the beginning of this year.</p>
        <p>The initiative in Texas is part of a trend to allow consumers to buy long-distance service from the regional Bell companies created by the breakup of AT&amp;T in the 1980's. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells were allowed to seek regulatory approval for long-distance service state by state. SBC received approval last week from the Federal Communications Commission for service in Texas.</p>
        <p>''We're encouraged to see greater competition with the likes of SBC moving into long distance,'' said Susan Grant, vice president for public policy at the National Consumers League in Washington. ''But this type of thing can be a blessing or a curse, because so many choices can be bewildering.''</p>
        <p>SBC, based in San Antonio, said it would announce a basic rate of 9 cents a minute for in-state and out-of-state calls anytime, with no monthly fee. For customers who choose services like call waiting or caller ID, SBC is offering a flat rate of 6 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>In addition, SBC will take advantage of the demographics of Texas, a state with a large Hispanic population, and cater some services to people who make frequent calls to Mexico. For instance, under one plan, calls to border towns in Mexico will cost 13 cents a minute, while calls to Mexico City will cost 34 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>''Our understanding from talking with our customers is that clarity, savings and one-stop shopping are very strong incentives to choose our plans,'' said David Cole, president for consumer markets at the Southwestern Bell unit of SBC.</p>
        <p>Analysts said customers choosing one of SBC's basic plans could save money because the average per-minute long-distance charge in Texas is more than 20 cents a minute. Nationwide, long-distance rates are about 20 cents a minute, according to the Gartner Group, a telecommunications research firm.</p>
