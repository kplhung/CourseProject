        <p>Stung by rising casualties, President Vladimir V. Putin promised today to reduce the use of Russian policemen in Chechnya and turn over more law enforcement responsibilities to pro-Moscow Chechens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's pledge followed a recent string of bombings that killed at least 33 Russian troops and police officers, including members of a police unit from Chelyabinsk, a city in the Russian Urals.</p>
        <p>It was the third major attack in recent months against the special Russian police units, known as OMON, that have been dispatched to Chechnya to keep order in towns and cities seized by the Russian Army.</p>
        <p>The assaults have brought the cost of the war home to the Russian heartland and created a potential political problem for the new president, who was elected largely because of his forceful policy toward Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Yegor Stroyev, the governor of the Oryol region, who is known for his loyalty to the Kremlin, summed up the sour mood today.</p>
        <p>''What is going on in Chechnya is more than a tragedy,'' Mr. Stroyev said. ''The military is telling us that large-scale operations are over, but why then do so many of our boys die there? How did the death of police officers from Chelyabinsk become possible in Argun? These questions must be answered.''</p>
        <p>During a surprise visit to the Mozdok military base near Chechnya on Wednesday, Mr. Putin reviewed the deteriorating situation with his top security aides. The Mozdok meeting -- Mr. Putin's first visible move on Chechnya since the Sunday bombings -- was broadcast on television news programs tonight and appeared to be a piece of political theater intended to repair the president's image as a decisive leader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin sat behind a desk, flanked by Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen and former religious leader whom he appointed to administer the republic. His top military aides and commanders sat in front of him like a group of errant schoolboys.</p>
        <p>One by one, Mr. Putin called them to account. He began by addressing his minister of defense, Igor D. Sergeyev, who snapped to attention.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has released you from your duties as chief of the antiterrorist operation,'' Mr. Putin said sternly.</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir,'' Marshal Sergeyev responded.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Putin turned to Vladimir B. Rushailo, the interior minister, whose forces include the police units that were the target of recent attacks.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Chelyabinsk militia, which was hit by the Sunday bomb attack, police units from Sergiyev Posad, a town near Moscow, and from the Perm region in Russia's Urals have suffered high casualties in deadly ambushes.</p>
        <p>Alluding to these attacks, Mr. Putin said that Russia must ''gradually stop sending scores of law enforcement people to Chechnya.'' Instead, he ordered Mr. Rushailo ''to involve local citizens in the work of law enforcement bodies in Chechnya more boldly and energetically.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin noted that the Chechen public had a better idea than the Russian troops who was loyal to Moscow and who supported the rebels. Or as Mr. Putin put it, ''the latest events have shown that large-scale tragedies did not happen in those places where local police officers were working.''</p>
        <p>But turning over responsibility to pro-Russia Chechens is not so easily done. Russian authorities have long tried to develop a Chechen militia.</p>
        <p>The most recent effort involved a Chechen paramilitary unit controlled by Bislan Gantamirov, a former mayor of Grozny who was jailed for embezzlement but was released and appointed to a Russian government post so he could fight on the Russian side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gantamirov's force, however, played only a minor role in the capture of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He and his men were recently discharged from their posts after Russian authorities in Chechnya charged that members of the force of about 300 had failed to carry out their duties and had vanished along with their weapons. Mr. Gantamirov is also a rival of Mr. Kadyrov. Still, he  was at the Mozdok meeting.</p>
        <p>Despite the rising Russian toll -- more than 2,300 Russian troops have died in the conflict, 61 just last week -- there is no mass antiwar movement in Russia and much of the public seems to despise the rebels more than ever.</p>
