        <p>In 1994, when Tiger Woods was still a teenager, Nick Price was the best golfer in the world.</p>
        <p>Price won six tournaments in 1994, including the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship. Golf seemed easy to Price then, just as it seems easy for Woods today. When Price played, he usually contended. And when he contended, he often won.</p>
        <p>But much has changed for Price since his glory days. He has not won a tournament since 1998, and at age 43, he sometimes wonders if he will ever win again. That made today's opening round of the Advil Western Open special for Price. Tying the course record with a nine-under-par 63 at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club, Price led by three strokes over Jim Furyk (66), and by four strokes over Carl Paulson, Steve Stricker, Stuart Appleby and Fred Couples.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Woods, playing his first tournament since winning the United States Open, and his only tournament before the British Open later this month, was at two under with an opening-round 70.</p>
        <p>While Woods struggled to find his putting stroke and squandered birdie opportunities, Price was sharper than a new razor blade. He shot a 30 on the front nine and birdied eight of the first 11 holes. At that point, the thought of shooting 59 crossed his mind. Instead, he settled for the course record, which he shares with Jeff Sluman (1992), John Adams (1993) and Dudley Hart (1998).</p>
        <p>Can Price play well enough for three more days to win the tournament? He wasn't sure. But today's round was a major confidence lifter.</p>
        <p>''I needed something like that because I've been floundering a little bit,'' said Price, who is ranked No. 11 in the world but who has not won since the FedEx St. Jude Classic in the summer of 1998. ''I got back on track today and had some good memories of times gone by.</p>
        <p>''Between now and the next two years, I want to give it my best shot, because at the end of next year I'll probably start slowing down a bit. Realistically, not many guys have played well past 45, and I'm 44 on my next birthday. So I better make the most of this year and next year.''</p>
        <p>Price capitalized on superb iron shots that left him in prime position for birdies. Six of Price's nine birdie putts were from inside 10 feet. He made a 17-foot putt for birdie at No. 11. At that point, Price was eight under par with seven holes remaining.</p>
        <p>If Price could have played the final seven holes at five under par, he would have shot 59, equaling the PGA Tour scoring record held by Al Geiberger (1977), Chip Beck (1991) and David Duval (1999). Price made par at No. 12, then barely saved par at No. 13, getting up and down from a bunker. Price stopped thinking about a 59, but he made one last birdie at No. 16, hitting a 7-iron approach shot that stopped 18 inches from the cup.</p>
        <p>Putting has been Price's nemesis in recent years, but he looked solid on the greens today. And Price has fond memories of this event, having won it in 1993 and in 1994.</p>
        <p>''Through '93 and '94, when I was putting great, I could have putted on peanut brittle, I would have made them,'' said Price, who tied Woods for most tour victories during the 1990's (15). ''Golf is like life. Sometimes things happen and you just can't explain them.</p>
        <p>''You question a lot of things when you're not playing well. It takes you six, eight weeks to work into a slump. But it only takes one good round to work out of it.''</p>
        <p>Woods will begin Friday trying to chip away at Price's lead. While Woods was fairly solid from tee to green, his putter acted as if it were still on vacation. Woods missed potential birdie putts from 10 feet at No. 10, from 12 feet at No. 13 and from 8 feet at No. 18. Afterward he refused to blame his performance on being rusty, or on letting down after winning the United States Open by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach on June 18.</p>
        <p>''I felt good, and I was ready to go from the first tee,'' said Woods, the defending champion, who is attempting to win this event for the third time in four years. ''Unfortunately, I just didn't make enough putts.''</p>
        <p>Woods can make a seven-stroke deficit disappear quickly, and Price is taking nothing for granted.</p>
        <p>''It's always good to get off to a good start, but there's a lot of golf left,'' Price said. ''If I get in the hunt, I'll start thinking about winning Sunday when I get to the back nine.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>FRANKLIN LANGHAM made a hole in one at the second hole, sinking a 6-iron from 173 yards. . . . BO JACKSON, the former professional football and baseball player, was among those in TIGER WOODS's gallery.</p>
