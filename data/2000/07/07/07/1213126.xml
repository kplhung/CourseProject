        <p>Eager for a bigger share of the growing school testing market, the Educational Testing Service, the company that designs and administers standardized exams for the College Board and other clients, has turned to a corporate executive as its next president.</p>
        <p>The testing service announced yesterday that it had hired Kurt Landgraf, the former chairman and chief executive of DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company.</p>
        <p>''Testing is more and more at the center of the national forum for discussion,'' said A. William Wiggenhorn, chairman of the service. ''It is clear we needed someone who could help us in that debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Landgraf, 53, will start work next month as president and chief executive of the company, which is based in Princeton, N.J. He succeeds Nancy S. Cole, 57, a testing expert who was president for six years.</p>
