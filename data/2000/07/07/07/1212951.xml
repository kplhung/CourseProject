        <p>''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sept. 3). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male personification of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in early maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students over 12 and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>

        <p>''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sept. 3). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male personification of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in early maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students over 12 and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* WILLIAM MERRITT CHASE, ''Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 13). Chase (1849-1916) had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician. But this show zeroes in on the five-year transitional phase from the brown, murky tones of his Munich training to his arrival at a lighter style based on French Impressionism. At this time he painted genteel views of park landscapes in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Aside from their engaging scenic content, the 35 oils and pastels in the show are important because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects. Recent examination corrected some errors about their locales. And new scholarly speculation on Chase's motives for painting them suggest that he wanted them to be examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''STUART DAVIS IN GLOUCESTER,'' National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through July 30). The quaint fishing port of Gloucester, Mass., seemed an unlikely hangout for the jazzy city painter Stuart Davis (1894-1964). But he loved the place, and in the summers he spent there, from 1915 to 1934, he used motifs drawn from the rocky coast, the townscape and the maritime activity as he worked toward a more progressive style of painting. This show, with some 45 oils, watercolors and drawings, gives a good account of his struggles in assimilating Modernist ideas to arrive at the innovative American Cubist style for which he is celebrated. But Davis's art had more to do with his own genius: his gift for paring line and shape to essences and uniting them with scintillating color. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays until 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50 for children 6 to 16, students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''EDWARD HOPPER, PRINTMAKER,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through July 16). Before concentrating on paintings, Hopper (1882-1967) made prints from 1913 to 1923. In that decade he produced his first mature work, a wonderful body of etchings that brought realism, emotion and a strong sense of the medium's potential to a field that had become more decorative than challenging. Using many of the motifs he was to pursue in his later paintings -- nudes, loners, decrepit houses, night scenes, railroad trains -- Hopper took full advantage of the intense moodiness a black-and-white etching can convey. The pervasive theme of loneliness and isolation for which he was noted is very much present in this show. The nearly 50 works here are a fine introduction to Hopper's basic themes and give a splendid idea of what he accomplished in the demanding medium. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50 for students and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF GOETHE,'' Paintings and Drawings From German Collections, Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, (212) 759-0606 (through Aug. 19). During the golden age (1829-1865) of the influential Dusseldorf Academy of Art, German artists flocked to Rome, where the academy maintained an informal outpost. What these northern artists loved about the Eternal City were the picturesque ruins, the beautiful vistas in the campagnas, the architecture of buildings and monuments, gardens, woods, walls, hill towns and above all the profusion of light, which bathed everything in a golden glow. More than 50 of their plein-air sketches along with finished oils are in this show, which upholds the museum's devotion to traditional academic art. Organized by the Hamburg Kunsthalle last year, the show celebrates the 250th birthday of the writer, polymath and art collector Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), whose widely read ''Italian Journey,'' published in 1829, inspired many of the artists to follow in his footsteps. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays until 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 17). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parsed her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress, or in Whitney terms, a two-floor treatment. Hours and admission: See above (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>* ''OTHER PICTURES: VERNACULAR PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE THOMAS WALTHER COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Aug. 27). A deceptively modest and sublimely endearing exhibition of several dozen photographs by anonymous amateurs, shot between the 1910's and 1960's, the heyday of the black-and-white snapshot, Surrealism and New Vision photography. They are a catalog of aspiring masterpieces in a modernist mode and serendipitous catastrophes. In the extraordinary way such things happen, these pictures traveled from drugstore to family album to attic to Dumpster to flea market into the hands of some scavenging dealer-collector, whereupon they became items on the art market, until finally wending their way to their present location. Isn't life amazing sometimes? And don't miss ''The Snapshot'' (through July 21), a companion show at the excellent Ubu Gallery, nearby at 16 East 78th Street, which includes several dozen more amateurs' gems, equally lovable. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''PAINTERS IN PARIS: 1895-1950,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 31). This show of more than 100 paintings celebrates the Met's acquisitions of works by School of Paris painters going back to 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed her portrait, done by Picasso in 1906. The portrait was a cornerstone for later acquisitions in the field, particularly over the last 20 years. The museum's increasing interest and diligent wooing of collectors have brought not only single works but also groups and entire holdings, like the 18 major objects bequeathed by Florene M. Schoenborn in 1995 and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman trove of 85 masterpieces accessioned in 1998. The treasures on view include works by some of the 20th century's greatest: Bonnard, Braque, Chagall, de Chirico, Derain, Gris, Leger, Matisse, Miro, Modigliani and Picasso, in an animated arrangement that should beguile the most jaded Met-goer. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''MAXFIELD PARRISH, 1870-1966,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Aug. 6). A romantic fabulist who painted in a tight, finicky mode that left out no detail, Parrish (1870-1966) was a highly accomplished illustrator who could be considered the father of Norman Rockwell. As a more aspiring painter, he also pursued a never-never world of chaste but titillating young women and knightly men in pastoral landscapes that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms. This show of more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, illustrations and ephemera ranges from such well-known Parrish chestnuts as ''Daybreak'' (1922), depicting a young woman's ecstatic awakening to an erotically symbolic Dawn, to his coy, cartoonish ''Old King Cole'' mural of 1894. Aside from its campy entertainment value, there is enough here -- particularly his graphic art and some fine landscapes -- to sustain the revival of interest in his work that began with the Pop Art era. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make connections that for the sake of simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed over. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its inclusionary standards. But patience is required. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''TIBOROCITY: DESIGN AND UNDESIGN BY TIBOR KALMAN,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222. (through Aug. 20). A survey of the busy career, subversive attitudes and contradictory ambitions of the graphic designer. Kalman (1949-1999) urged greater social awareness on the design and advertising profession, although its raison d'etre is to move products. The work that his company, M &amp; Company, created in the 1980's for chic clients like Isaac Mizrahi, the Talking Heads, the Manhattan restaurant Florent and Interview magazine is in evidence. Also represented are the 13 issues of Colors, the magazine he created and edited for the Italian clothing manufacturer Benetton in the early 90's. There is plenty of proof here that most graphic design has a limited shelf life and that even socially conscientious designers create their share of useless baubles. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>''TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL TOMBS OF UR,'' Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 10). The Sumerians flourished in third-millennium B.C. Mesopotamia, creating one of the earliest civilizations as they devised such essentials as writing, numbers, the wheel and irrigation. This sumptuous exhibition attests to their visual achievement with gold, silver and carved calcite vessels; weapons, tools and cylinder seals; and ingenious jewelry made of lapis lazuli, carnelian and gold. On view as well are several of art history's most familiar if least exhibited masterpieces. All belong to the University of Pennsylvania and are part of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries: the intact, lavishly equipped royal tombs excavated at Ur in the 1920's by C. Leonard Woolley. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays until 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>JOAQUIN TORRES-GARCIA, CDS, 76 East 79th Street, (212) 772-9555 (through July 29). The pioneering, peripatetic Uruguayan Modernist is represented here in a modest exhibition of small works on paper and several easel-size oil paintings. The show includes early, brusquely painted city and harbor scenes but is devoted mainly to the artist's distinctive combination of grid-based abstraction and cosmic, pictographic symbolism (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ROBERT ARNESON, ''Me, Myself and I,'' Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 248-5360 (through July 21). One of the zaniest of gifted self-portrayers, the ceramist Robert Arneson (1930-1992) models his own head in a multiplicity of guises. A dozen versions appear in this first commercial gallery survey of Arneson likenesses. The concentration is on work done in the 70's and 80's, from a very pink and benign Santa Claus to a scary, scowling mask in black and white that suggests a searcher scratching at his own dark soul. This show barely hints at the many personas Arneson conjured up, but it does give the sense of a maverick talent in total command of his medium, who in his cartoony explorations hit not only on himself but on everyman as well (Glueck).</p>
        <p>DONALD SULTAN, Mary Ryan, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669 (through July 28). In this show of works on paper, Mr. Sultan continues to give rich painterly body to images of apples, eggs and flowers. The main attractions are a six-foot square woodcut of giant green apples overlaid by flat, black egg silhouettes and a dark brown, digitally generated silk-screen image of glowing smoke rings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''HERBERT BAYER: CENTENNIAL,'' Kent, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through July 21). This small survey celebrates the 100th birthday of Bayer, first a student and then a director at the Bauhaus. (He died in 1985.) Bayer worked in many styles and media, from straight photography to Surrealistic montage to cosmic abstract painting. Always wielding a neat, precise touch, he also did graphic and architectural design and advertising. His work is almost always interesting but tends to be more cleverly derivative than deeply original (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MAUDE SCHUYLER CLAY, ''Delta Land,'' Ariel Meyerowitz Gallery, 580 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 625-3434 (through July 14). The slow, languorous countryscape of the Mississippi Delta is registered in black and white by Ms. Clay, a sixth-generation native of the locale. She focuses on the flatlands, their trees, bayous, old buildings and abandoned plantations, rather than the people and impoverished communities already documented by other photographers. White, timeworn churches are a favorite subject, and Ms. Clay is also enamored of the way water seeps through the land in creeks, bayous and swamps. As befits their subject, the photographs are quite traditional, but Ms. Clay has managed to capture the poetry of the place (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''FUNDAMENTAL OCCURRENCES,'' Malca, 580 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-8854 (through July 29). Seven abstract painters deal personally with the basics of surface, pattern and color. The show includes Robin Bruch's all-over crystalline webs, Eve Sonneman's all-over fields of little circles atop bigger circles, Glenn Goldberg's abstracted blossoms, Harold Porcher's colored stripe permutations, Chris Martin's big and small cosmic boxes on a huge blue canvas, Joe Fyfe's brushy tumbling boxes and Charles Cooper's subtle, gameboard-like watercolors (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAOUL HAGUE, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 941-0012 (through July 28). The five tree-trunk-size sculptures here, each cut from a single piece of walnut, are like Abstract Expressionist paintings turned to living wood; they also strongly imply monumental human figures. Carving aggressively but in sympathy with the undulant form and serpentine grain of the log, Hague (1904-1993) created these powerful weddings of art and nature between 1969 and 1978. Here they ride on the wheeled dollies that the artist favored for storage, which gives the massive forms a curious sense of lightness and mobility (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''INSIDE OUT: REALITY OR FICTION?,'' Sean Kelly, 43 Mercer Street, (212) 343-2405 (through July 21). This unusually satisfying, three-pronged approach to the photography of constructed realities includes James Casebere's gloomy pictures of strategically lighted architectural models; photographs of sets for television shows and commercials by Miriam Backstrom; and, by Candida Hofer, pictures of real library interiors that seem, in this context, strangely artificial (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ERIKA KNERR, ''Marking Time,'' Lance Fung, 537 Broadway, at Spring Street, (212) 334-6242 (through July 14). A vast canopy stitched in the pattern of an Amish quilt fills the space just above the viewer's head. Its downward-bellied form could suggest pregnancy and, in fact, Ms. Knerr's project relates obliquely to a personal, 10-year preoccupation with fertility issues. Still, the experience is more formal than psychological (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''LIVING DOLL,'' The Work Space, 96 Spring Street, (212) 219-2790 (through Aug. 11). Eleven artists play with dolls to intermittently engaging effect. Included are emotionally loaded, painterly images by Ellen Phelan; a touching photograph of a little doll-toting French girl by Sylvia Plachy; Alyson Pou's macabre fragments and transformations; a funny doll family portrait by Elisabeth Condon; and David Levinthal's erotic ''Doll With Whip'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>LOUIS MONZA, Luise Ross, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through July 21). The self-taught Monza, who was born in Italy in 1897 and died in California in 1984, was known for his bold and passionate social protest paintings. Late in life, however, his art became otherworldly. His preoccupation with issues like environmental pollution and nuclear disaster persists, but in many of the small drawings from the 60's, 70's and 80's on view here, the serpentine line, radiant light and densely improvised, mythic imagery bespeak a psychedelic turn of mind (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SUMMER SHOW,'' DFN, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 334-3400 (through Aug. 18). Among the 53 works in this cheerfully uneven hodgepodge of a show are pictures of sun bathers by Joan Semmel; a large, darkly expressionistic beach scene in charcoal by Susan Grossman; small, woozily distorted suburban images by Steve Mumford; a gloomy, swampy landscape painted by William McCarthy; and a painting of a naked sunbather with a strategically placed book by Elyse Taylor (Johnson).</p>
        <p>KEVIN WIXTED, David Beitzel, 102 Prince Street, (212) 219-2863 (through July 14). Mr. Wixted's grid-based paintings have vibrant color, thick waxy surfaces, all sorts of patterns and a repeating inventory of symbols, including tulips, hex signs, a cow's head, faces from the Book of Kells and a pine tree. Philip Taaffe and Donald Baechlor come to mind. The paintings have decorative appeal but they could be more surprisingly idiosyncratic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>CARLA KLEIN, Bonakdar Jancou, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144 (through July 14). A Dutch painter based in London has her first solo show in the United States. Ms. Klein's most impressive works are large, blue-green and white pictures of vacant swimming pools in which smeary, drippy paint and glaring light create a vertiginous mix of Piranesian expansion and Abstract Expressionist flux (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''A SELECTIVE SURVEY OF POLITICAL ART,'' John Weber, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 691-5711 (through July 22). Including works from the last four decades, this 16-artist show is more dryly academic than urgently political. The freshest work is an elaborate, precisely drawn conspiracy diagram by Mark Lombardi; the most sensuous is an embroidered world map by Alighiero E. Boetti. There are works from the early 80's by Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger and handlettered antiwar texts on postcards made in the 1960's by Ad Reinhardt (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>* ''THE ART OF PUBLISHERS' BOOKBINDINGS: 1815-1915,'' Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through July 29). This sumptuous display of more than 250 books offers a fascinating window onto the history of book production and cover design. Many volumes are more interesting for historical than for aesthetic reasons, but the show is studded with visual gems, like a haunting gilded design centered on the image of scissors and a lock of hair by Aubrey Beardsley for Alexander Pope's ''Rape of the Lock'' (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''AT THE EDGE: A PORTUGUESE FUTURIST -- AMADEO DE SOUZA CARDOSO,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-1704 (through Sept. 16). One of those perfect, dropped-from-the-sky retrospectives, this show introduces a talented and ambitious Portuguese modernist who died in 1918 at the age of 30. In the previous 10 years he had absorbed several budding modern art movements in Paris, especially Cubism and Futurism, combined them with references to things Portuguese and produced vividly colored, carefully calibrated paintings. They seem ahead of their time in their mixing of styles, images, materials and cultural references. His exceptional draftsmanship is shown in a series of ultra-refined drawings that suggest Ingres high on Cubism (Smith).</p>
        <p>''TRANSPARENT ARCHITECTURE,'' Gale Gates, 37 Main Street, Brooklyn, (718) 522-4596 (through July 15). Organized by Anne Ellegood, this show smartly kicks off the gallery's ''Emerging Curators Series'' with art that plays in interesting ways with images of architecture and surveillance. Interiors are shot surreptitiously through windows or filmed with hidden cameras. Exteriors are captured in aerial views. Residential secrets are made public through advertising. There are no safe houses here, and the cool, eerie sleekness of the largely photographic work suits the theme. The artists, including Merry Alpern, David Deutsch, Jonah Freeman, Ashley Hunt, George Kimmerling and Warren Neidich, make a strong team (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''WOMEN OF THE WORLD: A GLOBAL COLLECTION OF ART,'' White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, at Horatio Street, (212) 924-4212 (through July 15). The artist Claudia DeMonte organized this show of many small works around a single sweeping idea: asking one woman from every country in the world to contribute a single piece of art addressing ''the experience of being a woman.'' In the end, not every country came through, but more than 170 works are on view. The results are uneven, but this show is less about the strengths or weaknesses of its individual parts than about the embracing humanistic impulse that brought them together (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ''EXTRA ORDINARY,'' James Cohan, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 755-7171 (through today). This excellent group exhibition presents a variety of ways of defamiliarizing the familiar. Outstanding works include a nearly hallucinatory sculptural portrait of an elderly woman by Ron Mueck, Tom Friedman's life-size ladybug, Roxy Paine's mushroom field, Michael Combs's carved and painted dead duck, Francis Cape's mysterious cabinet, Vija Celmins's velvety starry sky painting, Robert Gober's folded door and glamorous floor polishers appropriated by Jeff Koons (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''FOR THE NEW CENTURY: JAPANESE TREASURES FROM THE ASIAN ART MUSEUM OF SAN FRANCISCO,'' Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Sunday). For a total immersion in sheer beauty, this gathering of some 50 classic objects is hard to beat. They include an exceptionally personable Haniwa warrior, wearing balloonlike trousers and a ''Hi, there'' smile, a big painting of Buddhist heaven and a famed 15th-century Shigaraki-ware jar that seems to hold an abstract landscape in a drift of snowy glaze. Hours: Today, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>ILYA AND EMILIA KABAKOV, ''The Palace of Projects,'' 69th Regiment Armory, Lexington Avenue at 26th Street, (212) 980-4575, (through Monday) Not Mr. Kabakov's best but a big, elaborate installation worth a close look anyway: a huge spiraling temporary pavilion shape like Tatlin's nautilus monument, a striking structure filled with 65 ''projects.'' These are fictive plans in the form of texts accompanied by models that turn the inside of the pavilion into what vaguely resembles a 4-H Club booth at a country fair. The projects are utopian dreams for improving the world, attributed to imaginary characters. There's some rehashing of older work and a little too much reading to absorb, but also compensatory Kabakovian attributes, like the wry absurdist literary style and the melancholic and  humanely nostalgic way of recalling Soviet life by which an art of political opposition is manifested as a kind of Proustian fantasy. Even when not at his most striking, Mr. Kabakov, now teamed with his wife, demonstrates an imagination that few other artists match. Hours: Daily, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Free. (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''SHAHZIA SIKANDER: ACTS OF BALANCE,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through today). Ms. Sikander has received well-deserved attention for her vivid, complex paintings, which infuse the traditional miniatures of India with a new crosscultural content. For this exhibition, she has expanded her themes into wall paintings veiled with sheets of opaque paper. The results, though ambitious, look obscurant rather than revealing. More successful are three large paintings hung high in the adjoining atrium, which suggest that this gifted artist is trying to move beyond the miniaturist label in what feels like a transitional show (Cotter).</p>
