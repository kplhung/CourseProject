        <p>''I wasn't born yet,'' says Why-me, the first interview subject of ''The Decline of Western Civilization, Part III,'' Penelope Spheeris's latest installment in her documentary series on the social trajectory of the Los Angeles punk scene. In the first ''Decline'' (1981), the curdled fomentation of punk was young and looming. In the second (1988), she spun nasty jokes on rock 'n' roll, and in this third episode, which is minor but telling, the movement has become an institution. Many of the young punks interviewed -- many in their teens, like Why-me -- are inheritors of a movement that existed before they did and has calcified into ritualized anarchic behavior. One of them, caught in a crowd scene, says, ''I know a guy that can suck an 'Icee' through his nose,'' and seconds later, we see it.</p>
        <p>The grand old punk Keith Morris, once part of the most ferocious Los Angeles punk band, Black Flag (which was a big part of the first ''Decline''), notes the prevalence of punk nowadays. ''There was a lot of energy and a lot of anger,'' he observes. ''It wasn't like it is today, where you could go out on any corner and see punk rock people.'' Those current punk youths are what the film calls gutterpunks, who inhabit the streets of Hollywood looking for handouts to live on. When asking for money, one of the spike-haired panhandlers says, ''I swear I won't waste it on food.''</p>

        <p>''I wasn't born yet,'' says Why-me, the first interview subject of ''The Decline of Western Civilization, Part III,'' Penelope Spheeris's latest installment in her documentary series on the social trajectory of the Los Angeles punk scene. In the first ''Decline'' (1981), the curdled fomentation of punk was young and looming. In the second (1988), she spun nasty jokes on rock 'n' roll, and in this third episode, which is minor but telling, the movement has become an institution. Many of the young punks interviewed -- many in their teens, like Why-me -- are inheritors of a movement that existed before they did and has calcified into ritualized anarchic behavior. One of them, caught in a crowd scene, says, ''I know a guy that can suck an 'Icee' through his nose,'' and seconds later, we see it.</p>
        <p>The grand old punk Keith Morris, once part of the most ferocious Los Angeles punk band, Black Flag (which was a big part of the first ''Decline''), notes the prevalence of punk nowadays. ''There was a lot of energy and a lot of anger,'' he observes. ''It wasn't like it is today, where you could go out on any corner and see punk rock people.'' Those current punk youths are what the film calls gutterpunks, who inhabit the streets of Hollywood looking for handouts to live on. When asking for money, one of the spike-haired panhandlers says, ''I swear I won't waste it on food.''</p>
        <p>There is an air of resignation about punk today. Pain is still a constant, and it is bewildering to hear the punkers, with piercings through the bridge of the nose, talk about being beaten by two types of skinheads, the Nazis and the anti-hate punks, who also travel in gangs. The anti-hate punks call themselves Sharp -- Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice -- and they practice their own brand of oppression. Ezzat Soliman talks about the only condition for admission at the club he owns: no politics. (He also talks about the kind of music he plays at home. ''I listen to Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Louis Armstrong,'' he says with a laugh.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Spheeris often places her interview subjects in front of a gray wall, with a single light bulb to illuminate the camera setup. One wishes she had pulled away a bit because in some instances ''Decline,'' which opens today at Cinema Village, comes off as the essay of a punk mom worried about her charges, babyfaces with Mohawks and tattoos that make them look like Maoris. That feeling also gives the movie a full-on sadness not found in the previous chapters, and her curiosity and maternal instinct mitigate some of the plus ca change resonance, especially since there is less of a community this time around. The little punkers are mostly loners who don't fit in.</p>
        <p>It's odd to see such feelings of naked aggression setting off a wave of nostalgia. Naked Aggression also happens to be the name of one of the bands, and its members are interviewed. They are trained musicians -- one is shown playing classical guitar; the vocalist noodles on a French horn -- and they are trapped in a paradox. They talk about the exploitation of punk bands at the hands of indie labels, which is actually more pronounced than they would experience from a major recording label. Yet if the bands signed to a major label, their fans would ignore them. ''That's the irony of it all,'' one responds.</p>
        <p>''Decline'' is best and most touching when it shows how willing punk is to eat its young. The anecdotes build momentum and power. ''It certainly hasn't gotten more beautiful,'' Mr. Morris muses, matter-of-factly, ''but the punk rock thing was never a beautiful thing.''</p>
