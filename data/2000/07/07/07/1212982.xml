        <p>The unexpected success of ''American Pie'' last summer, in which a fresh crop of young actors obsessed about losing their virginity, and an apple pie was rudely disturbed in the process, has accelerated the trend toward vulgar, borderline-tasteless comedy and has some shaking their heads. How low will Hollywood go to lure young people into theaters? The most recent flurry of tsk-tsking occurred with the release of ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' a Jim Carrey comedy that pokes fun at mental illness and the disabled and does brazen things to a cow and a chicken.</p>
        <p>But a fresh wave of scorn may well greet the release today of ''Scary Movie'' (review, Page 8), a gleefully over-the-top satire of teen-slasher flicks including the ''Scream'' series and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The film, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, focuses less on the horror aspects than the sexual ones and includes digs at ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''The Usual Suspects'' and a host of more mainstream films. No baked goods or poultry were violated in the making of the film, but there is plenty of sex, sex talk, sex satire and pot-smoking, and one particularly rude, up-the-dress shot that involves prosthetics of a type not seen since Mark Wahlberg unzipped in ''Boogie Nights'' in 1997.</p>

        <p>The unexpected success of ''American Pie'' last summer, in which a fresh crop of young actors obsessed about losing their virginity, and an apple pie was rudely disturbed in the process, has accelerated the trend toward vulgar, borderline-tasteless comedy and has some shaking their heads. How low will Hollywood go to lure young people into theaters? The most recent flurry of tsk-tsking occurred with the release of ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' a Jim Carrey comedy that pokes fun at mental illness and the disabled and does brazen things to a cow and a chicken.</p>
        <p>But a fresh wave of scorn may well greet the release today of ''Scary Movie'' (review, Page 8), a gleefully over-the-top satire of teen-slasher flicks including the ''Scream'' series and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The film, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, focuses less on the horror aspects than the sexual ones and includes digs at ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''The Usual Suspects'' and a host of more mainstream films. No baked goods or poultry were violated in the making of the film, but there is plenty of sex, sex talk, sex satire and pot-smoking, and one particularly rude, up-the-dress shot that involves prosthetics of a type not seen since Mark Wahlberg unzipped in ''Boogie Nights'' in 1997.</p>
        <p>''We do our bad taste in good taste,'' promised Bob Weinstein, one of the brothers who runs Miramax Films, distributors of both the ''Scream'' series and this satire. ''What you do is you look at the barometer of where the other guys have gone and then you try to go a little further. The bottom line is, if it's funny, it stays; if it's not, it goes.''</p>
        <p>In the pre-release tracking -- a series of surveys to monitor audience awareness of a movie -- that precedes the opening of virtually every new film in Hollywood these days, ''Scary Movie'' has been doing very well, indicating that there is a good deal of pent-up demand to see the film (if the polling is correct, which it isn't always; last week ''The Patriot'' was tracking much better than ''The Perfect Storm,'' yet the latter did twice as well at the box office over the holiday weekend).</p>
        <p>''It's tracking through the roof,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
        <p>Talk about tracking is almost pathological in Hollywood these days, despite its spotty history. It gives marketing executives some idea of how well their campaigns are working and has a jargon all its own.</p>
        <p>''We're 15 percent over all first choice a week before the release,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''And in the quadrants, the news is even better. For males under 14, we're 24 percent; for females in that age group, we're 29. For the same two categories, 'Perfect Storm' was 9 and 9. For all teenagers, 'Patriot' was 9, 'Perfect Storm' was 5. We're 34.''</p>
        <p>And unlike the two big holiday films, which had budgets of more than $100 million, ''Scary Movie'' was made for a relatively minuscule $19 million and makes no effort to disguise the fact.</p>
        <p>Originally Miramax intended to open the film in about 2,000 theaters, wedged two weeks after the release of the Carrey movie and three weeks before the release of Eddie Murphy in ''Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps.'' As some summer films have faltered, especially during a late-June slump at the box office, Miramax has grown more aggressive about expanding the movie's release.</p>
        <p>''Now, we'll be on close to 4,000 screens,'' Mr. Weinstein said. ''We picked up 800 in the last two weeks alone. Basically, based on this tracking, we're taking any theater we can get.''</p>
        <p>Camp for 60-Year-Olds</p>
        <p>Harry Shearer sat on the crowded Hollywood set, meant to resemble a television station's control booth, surrounded by the bare-bones crew of a new movie he has written and is directing. In this scene, Howard Hesseman, remembered by many as the disc jockey Johnny Fever on the 1970's television series ''WKRP in Cincinnati,'' is playing a television producer trying to work out the details of a new commercial for adult diapers. Mr. Shearer tugged at his Spy magazine T-shirt as he watched the scene unfold.</p>
        <p>The film, ''Call o' the Glen,'' is from a script Mr. Shearer began six or seven years ago, he said, and is based on his fascination with Bohemian Grove, the super-private power retreat in Northern California where leaders from business and politics regularly gather in a kind of summer-camp bonding experience. Famous for guarding the privacy of its powerful guests and for forcing them to do some of their own cooking and cleaning, the whole idea seemed ripe for satire, said Mr. Shearer, who was invited to visit the camp while he was doing research for the script. ''There is just something that seems so goofy and sweet about men 60 and up reliving their sophomore days at college,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Hesseman and Mr. Shearer (who plays the camp's chief cook), the cast includes TV series survivors like Morgan Fairchild, George Wendt, Alan Thicke, Kenneth Mars, Henry Gibson, Kurtwood Smith and Ming-Na. It is being shot on newfangled digital cameras for a budget of less than $600,000 by Visionbox Pictures, a new production company hoping to exploit this less expensive digital technology that theoretically will make it possible to make more movies more cheaply. The entire shooting schedule is three weeks.</p>
        <p>The plan, Mr. Shearer said, is to take his time editing the film but to try to have it ready for the festival circuit, perhaps as early as the Sundance festival in January, and from there, to attract a theatrical distributor. ''I knew this was a picture that no one could really understand until they saw the performances,'' he said. ''You can't just read the script; you have to see Kenny Mars reading the line. So we're hoping we'll get a better price by presenting distributors with a finished film than by selling off the rights beforehand to raise production money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shearer has been a steady presence in radio, television and films for a quarter-century, as a regular on ''Saturday Night Live'' in the late 1970's and early 80's, one of the writers and stars of Rob Reiner's classic 1984 rockumentary, ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' and one of the main voice-over artists behind ''The Simpsons.'' In recent years he has made a kind of cottage industry out of playing fatuous television journalists, including a talk-show moderator in last year's ''EdTV'' and, in 1998, an interviewer in ''The Truman Show'' and a boneheaded anchorman in ''Godzilla.''</p>
        <p>The ''Call o' the Glen'' script is one of just two he has rattling around in his desk. He said he shies away from churning out scripts for recreation or in hopes of raising his odds.</p>
        <p>''I refuse to have more than two unproduced scripts at any one time,'' Mr. Shearer said. ''I feel that my role in life is not to produce something that will only end up as decoration in some agent's office.''</p>
