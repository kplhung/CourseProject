        <p>After months of resisting, federal prosecutors today identified an array of countries, from Australia to Switzerland to China, as some of the nations that a scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets from the Los Alamos National Laboratory might have tried to assist.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, immediately ridiculed some entries on the list.</p>
        <p>''These are not countries which anyone other than the prosecutors have identified as presenting any kind of nuclear threat to the United States,'' Mark Holscher, one of the lawyers, said.</p>
        <p>But the filing, which came only after Judge James A. Parker of Federal District Court ordered it, reinforced a government theory that Dr. Lee might have improperly downloaded the trove of secret data because he wanted to enhance his job prospects with a foreign agency after being told by the laboratory in the early 1990's that he might be laid off.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's lawyers flatly rejected the charges. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail. Dr. Lee faces life in prison if convicted at a trial set for November.</p>
        <p>In its filing today, the government said that in about 1993, Dr. Lee wrote letters to institutions in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan seeking employment.</p>
        <p>The government also stated that Dr. Lee had made contact with officials from the Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in China, though it did not provide a reason.</p>
        <p>Patricia Chavez, a spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office in Albuquerque, where the case is being heard, said prosecutors would not comment beyond the three-page document.</p>
        <p>For some time, Dr. Lee's lawyers have demanded that the prosecutors provide a so-called bill of particulars, specifying which countries the government believed Dr. Lee was trying to assist.</p>
        <p>Those details are important, because Dr. Lee was charged not just with improperly downloading the data, but doing so with the intention of aiding a foreign country and harming the United States.</p>
        <p>George A. Stamboulidis, the assistant United States attorney who is leading the prosecution, tried to walk a legal tightrope in his filing today, leaving the government maximum flexibility by keeping its case vague.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis argued that Dr. Lee had not necessarily decided which country he intended to assist when he downloaded the weapons data. He also contended that the government need prove only that Dr. Lee intended to harm the United States, and not necessarily that he intended to provide an advantage to another country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis also said the government could add names to the list.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee, who is 60, was originally the subject of a sweeping investigation because of concerns that he might have given China the secret to developing a miniaturized American warhead known as the W-88. Because of those concerns, he was fired in March 1999.</p>
        <p>But when Dr. Lee was indicted on 59 felony counts in December, it was not for espionage. Instead, he faces charges that he had improperly downloaded the data from a secure to an unsecure computer, then placed the information on portable computer tapes. Seven of those tapes have never been recovered, though Dr. Lee has said that, in keeping with laboratory policy, he destroyed them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's lawyers have not disputed that he received a notice saying he might be laid off, or that he contacted some agencies about jobs.</p>
        <p>They have said, though, that Dr. Lee's contact with the scientific institute in China was an official trip paid for and sponsored by the laboratory. And they rejected the idea that any downloading Dr. Lee did had anything to do with improving his job prospects.</p>
        <p>''To me, the most noteworthy thing about this is that after all those months investigating him and seven months after indicting him, they still don't have a theory on what he was doing or who he was trying to help,'' Nancy Hollander, another lawyer for Dr. Lee, said.</p>
