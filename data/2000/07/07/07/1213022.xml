        <p>Asking repeatedly ''Whose side are you on?,'' Vice President Al Gore today drew a sharp contrast between his Medicare proposals and those of Gov. George W. Bush. He branded Mr. Bush, his likely Republican opponent, the candidate of powerful industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore lectured with charts and graphs at a suburban senior citizens'  center, seeking to put a debate over Medicare, the popular Great Society health insurance program for the elderly, at the forefront of the campaign agenda.</p>
        <p>He said he would devote $339 billion to shoring up the program during the next decade and adding a new prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Mr. Bush, he said, had allotted ''not one dime in his proposal for extending, strengthening, adding to Medicare. Not a penny.''</p>
        <p>Time and again, Mr. Gore directed pointed and detailed questions at Mr. Bush, who rarely talks about Medicare. The governor has put forward broad principles -- but little detail -- for creating more competition between private and public health plans to overhaul Medicare for the retirement of the baby boom generation.</p>
        <p>Turning to Medicare questions for which Mr. Bush has not provided specific answers, Mr. Gore asked whether Mr. Bush supported raising the eligibility age, or raising premiums, or sending more recipients to health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>''If Medicare is important to you, these questions are something you should know the answer to,'' Mr. Gore told the audience of local elderly residents.</p>
        <p>The vice president also used a version of an old union organizing slogan about choosing sides as he tried to frame the presidential election.</p>
        <p>''In this election for president,'' he said, ''the fundamental choice has to do with whose side are you on. I want to fight for the people; the other side fights for the powerful.''</p>
        <p>''And that's why the big pharmaceutical companies are supporting Governor Bush,'' Mr. Gore said. ''That's why the big oil companies are supporting Governor Bush. That's why the big polluters are supporting Governor Bush. That's why the H.M.O.'s and insurance companies are supporting Governor Bush.''</p>
        <p>Today's debate about Medicare was a sign of a new stage in the Gore campaign. This spring he repeatedly denounced Mr. Bush's policy proposals as ''risky.'' Then he stepped back and detailed some new policy proposals of his own. Now he is trying to start drawing the contrasts between his own ideas and those of Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Medicare is traditionally an issue that plays to the advantage of Democrats. So far this year it has not had the prominence in the presidential race that Social Security has had, even though experts say it faces the possibility of insolvency earlier than the retirement program does.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign for its part accused Mr. Gore of practicing the politics of class warfare.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush's campaign is focused on bringing people together, while Al Gore is trying to pit one group of Americans against another,'' a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today. ''We always knew the latest version of Al Gore the positive wouldn't last long.''</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign also called Mr. Gore and President Clinton obstacles to keeping Medicare solvent because last year all four of Mr. Clinton's appointees to a bipartisan, 17-member group opposed its chairman's ideas for overhauling the health care program.</p>
        <p>''Al Gore's charts and graphs can't hide the fact that the Clinton-Gore administration opposed bipartisan Medicare reform and they submitted a budget to cut Medicare spending by $70 billion,'' said another Bush spokesman, Dan Bartlett, pointing to some savings Mr. Clinton had proposed for the program in his 2001 budget. Mr. Bush would not support those reductions, Mr. Bartlett said.</p>
        <p>But along with those savings, Mr. Clinton has also called for adding an expensive new prescription drug program. Mr. Gore's slightly different version of the proposal would cost $255 billion over a decade.</p>
        <p>Last year, the bipartisan commission, headed by Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, fell one vote short of the 11 needed to approve a final report intended to forge a consensus on how to overhaul Medicare. Ten commission members, eight Republicans and two Democrats, voted for major changes that would convert Medicare into an arena for competition among public and private health plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has criticized the Clinton administration for opposing the Breaux plan. And Mr. Bush's broad concepts generally mirror those of the majority on the commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breaux had proposed that the government, instead of paying separately for each medical service, offer a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary. The beneficiary could use the money to buy private health insurance, through a managed care plan, or to enroll in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.</p>
        <p>He also proposed to offer Medicare coverage of prescription drugs as a new benefit, with the government paying for drugs for people with incomes up to 35 percent above the poverty level. Health maintenance organizations and other private health plans would have had to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, but they could charge extra.</p>
        <p>Mr. Breaux would have also gradually raised the eligibility age to 67, from 65, would have charged higher premiums to high-income people, and would have required beneficiaries to pay 10 percent of the cost of home health care visits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has taken a different approach, shying away from the efforts to turn more of the program over to private insurers. He would use $40 billion of the expected budget surplus and $75 billion of savings in interest payments from paying down the national debt to extend the life of Medicare until 2030. He would also enact nearly $30 billion in savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore told his audience today that he had opposed the Medicare commission's report because he felt it would raise the eligibility age, lead to higher premiums and push more people into H.M.O.'s.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said the governor supported the concepts of the Breaux commission. But he said Mr. Bush had not said where he stood on the eligibility age, and he said the governor did not believe that the Breaux plan would lead to premium increases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not set out his own Medicare plan but instead named six principles for change. He has said there should be no rise in payroll taxes. And he wants Medicare to offer every recipient a ''choice of plans including the option of purchasing a plan that covers prescription drugs.'' He has said Medicare must cover expenses for low-income elderly.</p>
        <p>His aides say Mr. Bush has earmarked $5 trillion over five years for shoring up Social Security and Medicare, including a provision for some kind of prescription drug benefit.</p>
