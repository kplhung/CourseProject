        <p>RUDKO-Lionel. Lionel Rudko was a companion, colleague and cherished friend for more than five decades. Ever since our first meeting in his record shop when he insisted that I hear the first recording of a young violinist named Isaac Stern we became close friends in music, musical ideas, and even more in our daily lives. We visited many other cities and countries together sharing a mutual zest for living. He worked together with me at Carnegie Hall and in my private office as my associate. In a long life, one meets many who become friends and, if one is fortunate, a few become a permanent part of one's life. It was so with Lionel. I mourn his passing as I would a brother but I celebrate his life with so many warm memories. Linda joins me in sending his wife Doris and daughter Lisa our most affectionate thoughts and we share their pain. Isaac and Linda Stern</p>
        <p>RUDKO-Lionel. The Board of Trustees and Staff of Carnegie Hall deeply mourn the passing of longtime loyal friend, Lionel Rudko. As General Manager of Carnegie Hall from 1962 to 1964, he helped guide the Hall during its early years as a corporation. We extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Doris and daughter Lisa. Isaac Stern, President Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, Executive and Artistic Director</p>
