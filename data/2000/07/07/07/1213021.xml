        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>A CHANGE IN VACATION PLANS  While political operatives and journalists fish for information about the status of Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma in the Republican vice-presidential sweepstakes, Mr. Keating is actually set to go fishing in Alaska next week. And it turns out that he was supposed to have been accompanied by the man charged with helping Gov. George W. Bush of Texas select a running mate, former Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney. A few days ago, Mr. Keating called Mr. Cheney and offered to stay home, lest their trip set too many tongues to wagging. But Mr. Cheney had already decided he was too busy to go. Even so, the initial arrangements for the trip, made before Mr. Cheney had assumed his role in the Bush campaign, demonstrated the many connections and long friendship between Mr. Cheney and Mr. Keating. Mr. Cheney has other Oklahoma ties: he is chief executive of the Halliburton Company, a Texas-based energy company that has operations in Oklahoma; and he was the national fund-raising chairman for the memorial in Oklahoma City for the victims of the 1995 bombing there.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>DIVERSITY ON THE DAIS  In an effort to emphasize diversity, the Republican National Committee has picked three members of Congress -- a Hispanic, an African-American and a woman -- for leadership roles at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. They are Representatives Henry Bonilla of Texas, J. C. Watts of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington. Each will help preside over the convention and deliver a speech. While the Bush campaign said yesterday that the appointments symbolized Mr. Bush's desire for the party to become more inclusive, the Gore campaign dismissed the appointments as being more symbolic than substantial. Others named to leadership positions are Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Gov. George E. Pataki of New York.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>COLLECTING CASH  The Democratic National Committee raised $60 million in the first six months of the year, nearly half of it at a huge dinner honoring President Clinton in May, a Democratic Party official said yesterday. The party had $30 million in the bank as of July 1, its best cash position at this stage of a presidential race, the official said. The Democrats raised $26 million in the first three months of the year and $34 million from April through June. On May 24, the party reaped $26.5 million at a single event -- a tribute to Mr. Clinton orchestrated by Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' most prolific fund-raiser. The party has spent $12.5 million on television advertisements pointing out differences with Republicans on Social Security and prescription drug benefits for the elderly. The Republicans have spent about $5 million on such issue advertising.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>PRIMARY RULES AT ISSUE  Citing a recent Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Democratic Party in Washington State has threatened to go to court unless state election rules are changed before the Sept. 19 primary to prevent a ''blanket primary.'' Washington has long used such a system, under which voters may choose any candidate for any party in the primary and the top Democratic and Republican vote-getters then face each other in a general election. But the Supreme Court recently struck down such wide-open primaries in a ruling involving California. Washington State's Democratic chairman, Paul Berendt, asked the Washington Secretary of State to create a new Democrat ballot that does not ''contain the names of any candidate standing for election as a nominee of any other political party or as an independent.'' But Gary McIntosh, the state elections director, said that the secretary of state lacked the authority to change the system and that the old system would have to be used unless the state Legislature intervened.</p>
