        <p>People selling single-family houses in New York State would be required to disclose the physical and environmental condition of the property on a questionnaire provided to potential buyers under a bill awaiting Gov. George E. Pataki's signature.</p>
        <p>The bill would constitute a significant shift away from the legal principle that has historically governed real estate transactions in the state: caveat emptor, or buyer beware.</p>
        <p>The State Senate and Assembly approved the bill unanimously last month, but it has yet to reach the governor's desk. Realtors support the bill, but groups representing lawyers oppose it. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for the governor, said that Mr. Pataki had not made a decision on the bill. He said the governor's lawyers must still review the details of the bill before he decided whether to sign or veto it.</p>
        <p>Among the 46 questions that the bill would require a home seller to answer -- ''to the best of your knowledge'' -- are whether the property was ever part of a landfill or a designated wetland, whether it had fuel tanks above or below ground, and whether it had asbestos in its structure or lead plumbing. It also asks whether the house has rot or water damage, pest infestation or an assortment of other defects.</p>
        <p>The bill, which does not apply to co-op or condominium apartments, would require that the homeowner deliver the disclosure form to the potential buyer by the time a contract of sale is signed, well before the closing.</p>
        <p>''If you purchase a car, you have this kind of protection, but not when you buy a house,'' said Salvatore L. Prividera Jr., a spokesman for the New York State Association of Realtors, which supports the bill.</p>
        <p>The City Bar Association, however, has urged the governor to veto it. And the New York State Bar Association has said it opposes the bill unless what it sees as flaws -- particularly in the penalties that can be imposed on a seller -- are corrected.</p>
        <p>''The notion that there is finally going to be some reasonable and measurable disclosure of environmental and public health dangers in residential transactions has, I think, scared a whole bunch of people,'' said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, who was the measure's chief sponsor.</p>
        <p>Thirty-three other states have some form of disclosure on the condition of property put on the market.</p>
        <p>Calling the bill ''a dramatic shift'' in the way homes are bought, Prof. Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, pointed out that New York courts ''historically adhere to the doctrine of caveat emptor when it comes to real estate transactions.''</p>
        <p>''Although there has been some loosening of the doctrine in recent years, for the most part, if a buyer purchases a home, he or she has virtually no recourse against the seller if it turns out that there is a problem,'' Professor Schill said. ''Of course, if the seller affirmatively misrepresented some condition regarding the property, verbally or in writing, the buyer could sue for fraud to void the contract.''</p>
        <p>In a few recent cases, however, some courts have given buyers relief when the seller concealed relevant information, Professor Schill said. He cited a 1991 case in which an appellate court ''sided with the buyer of a house in Nyack who sued the seller for failing to disclose that the house had a reputation for being haunted.'' The court, while reaffirming the doctrine of caveat emptor, nonetheless voided the contract.</p>
        <p>It is the issue of voiding the contract -- or recision in legal parlance -- that particularly troubles the state bar association.</p>
        <p>In its penalty section, the proposed disclosure law says that a seller who fails to perform the duties prescribed by the law can be held liable for the damages suffered by a buyer because of a condition that was willfully misreported on the questionnaire. But, in another clause, it says the seller can also be held liable according to ''any existing equitable and statutory remedy.''</p>
        <p>In a report on the bill, the state bar association says it ''fails to prohibit recision'' -- annulment of the deal -- ''after the transfer of title, as most other states do.''</p>
        <p>The state bar says the bill ''may be laudatory in principle,'' but contains other flaws, including defining ''defect'' in a vague manner. And it would ''expose an unwary seller to claims that the seller 'should have known' of information actually unknown to the seller,'' the state association said.</p>
        <p>And the chairman of the real property section of the city's bar association, L. Stanton Towne, said his organization had called on Governor Pataki to veto the bill, in part because ''in many cases, the act requires disclosure far greater than many sellers could reasonably be expected to give; for instance, whether there is lead plumbing, the type of roof covering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brodsky countered: ''The statute is based on what people know, and it creates no new requirements. If they had no knowledge of it at the time of closing, there's no issue.</p>
        <p>''Nothing in the bill changes any liability. We are giving folks a sense of what the seller might know, and what they should be asking. This should in no way change people's need for their own independent analysis of what any buyer must confront -- structural safety, environmental concerns. In any case, the property should be inspected.''</p>
