        <p>Continuing his long-running game of ''Anyone Can Be an Artist as Long as I'm in Charge,'' Robert Rauschenberg has unveiled his latest enterprise at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Called ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' the new divertissement -- if one may use that word for such a dull performance -- is a group of 52 panels, the number alluding to a full deck of cards.</p>
        <p>Each panel bears a characteristically disparate mix of photographic images taken by Mr. Rauschenberg around the globe and transferred to the panels' polylaminate surfaces. The paintinglike photographs include objects, street scenes, people and natural phenomena, along with snippets from advertising, magazines and newspapers. Interspersed with abstract passages from paintings, these seemingly stream-of-consciousness images are played off against one another in arrangements that allow for multiple readings on the part of the viewer.</p>
        <p>Involved with the notion of audience participation in his art for many years, Mr. Rauschenberg invited 12 fellow celebrities to shuffle the panels for public presentation. That is, each was given a chance to ''compose'' his or her own work, selecting from three to seven of the panels and placing them in whatever juxtaposition came to mind. A Whitney press release states portentously that ''the singular nature'' of ''Synapsis Shuffle'' dictates that its 52 components be rearranged by different people each time it is installed, ''so that new works are continuously created from it.''</p>
        <p>But it's a little hard to buy the premise that anyone can create a new work simply by pushing around the artist's components.</p>
        <p>Anyway, using the maximum of seven panels, the artist Chuck Close selected those with images ranging from a cherub sitting on a cornice to a tiny man on a scaffolding painting a large orange wall. Martha Stewart, the lifestyle entrepreneur, picked three panels that included one with a photo of elephants' rear ends placed next to a cartoon of a giant lobster on the back of a truck. In his five-panel arrangement, Mike Wallace, the television journalist, included one that bore an image of a fire plug and another showing a photograph of an Indian brave.</p>
        <p>Mathilde Krim, chairwoman of the board of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, defied convention by turning one of her three panels back to front, so that only its bare frame shows. And the soprano Renee Fleming impishly decreed that her four panels should appear sideways. Other shufflers included Michael Ovitz, the talent agent and art collector; the art critic Robert Hughes; the museum director and curator Walter Hopps; the musician and photographer David Byrne; the choreographer Merce Cunningham; the designer Edwin Schlossberg; and the art dealer Ileana Sonnabend.</p>
        <p>A long video loop displayed with the show details the selection procedure on May 15 (at a Long Island City warehouse). It has all the pumped-up gaiety of a celebrity fund-raiser. What's truly amazing is how Mr. Rauschenberg managed to get this high-powered group together in one space on one particular day to participate in this hollow exercise. That is really the most successful accomplishment of the show.</p>
        <p>It is also amazing how Mr. Rauschenberg himself has kept shuffling the same ideas, more or less, into larger and larger projects that take up enormous gallery space at the country's museums. He started out as a bombshell in the early 1950's, a young, hugely talented artist with an open, experimental approach to techniques and materials. He anticipated the transition from Abstract Expressionism to the emerging Pop Art movement by using Expressionist gesture with everyday objects and images. It was a giant, fresh leap. Certainly he has been an enormous influence in the art world, and his pioneering use of the transfer technique, particularly in works like his 1958-60 illustrations for Dante's ''Inferno,'' opened up new paths for younger artists. But now it has become a cliche in his work.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade and a half his work has sadly lapsed into some of the most boringly predictable bromides of the art world. During that time he has been assembling his repertory of images taken from here, there and everywhere around the globe, into endless epics, like his 1984-1991 ROCI project (Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange), covering his exposure to cultural traditions in each of 11 countries, among them China, Mexico, Japan, Venezuela, Cuba and others, using materials and images from each country's culture. This giant piece was presented in full at the National Gallery of Art in 1991 and in part at the traveling Rauschenberg retrospective organized by the Guggenheim in 1997.</p>
        <p>A precursor to the present ''Shuffle'' is ''The  1/4 Mile or 2 Furlong Piece,'' a continuing extravaganza that at last count had more than 200 painted and sculptural elements, extended more than 1,000 feet and was still growing. It was exhibited in 1987 at the Metropolitan; 10 years later with add-ons as part of a Guggenheim retrospective, and this year at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams. Like ''Furlong,'' Mr. Rauschenberg considers ''Shuffle'' a piece ''in perpetual evolution.''</p>
        <p>The pretentiousness of ''Synapsis Shuffle,'' the celebrity-kissing self-promotion it has involved, and the wasteful allotment of nearly 6,000 square feet of gallery to it at the space-challenged Whitney are not cause for celebration.</p>
        <p>Neither is the sheer chutzpah of calling these hoary Rauschenberg cliches ''a new masterwork'' and proclaiming that the participation of people other than the artist in arranging them gives the project ''an element of chance.''</p>
        <p>''Synapsis Shuffle'' turns out to be the same old Rauschenberg deal, and it won't go away. It has been promised as a gift to the Whitney by Leonard A. Lauder, chairman of the Estee Lauder Companies, who is also chairman of the Whitney's board, a diligent fund-raiser for the museum and a prime donor of art and money himself.</p>
        <p>It's a pity that the Whitney has all but turned itself into a Rauschenberg coliseum and that as museums expand their capacity, Mr. Rauschenberg's work expands to fill it.</p>
        <p>''Robert Rauschenberg: Synapsis Shuffle'' is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676, through Oct. 8.</p>
