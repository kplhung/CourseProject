        <p>The young Bob Fosse, moving his hips in a snaky wriggle and dropping his shoulders in 3D? How can you miss it? Film Forum is running the 3D version of the 1953 musical ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' although the Technicolor process itself makes the film so eye-poppingly crisp that it almost seems three-dimensional without the special glasses.</p>
        <p>Howard Keel, not above kidding himself, plays Fred Graham, the smug, vain and predatory star -- and he's the hero -- trying to persuade his former wife, Lilli (Kathryn Grayson), to join him in a Broadway musical adaptation of ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' with music by his pal Cole Porter (Ron Randell). It helps that Mr. Keel seems to wince every time Ms. Grayson opens her mouth, because she is a pill, and a shrill pill at that.</p>

        <p>The young Bob Fosse, moving his hips in a snaky wriggle and dropping his shoulders in 3D? How can you miss it? Film Forum is running the 3D version of the 1953 musical ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' although the Technicolor process itself makes the film so eye-poppingly crisp that it almost seems three-dimensional without the special glasses.</p>
        <p>Howard Keel, not above kidding himself, plays Fred Graham, the smug, vain and predatory star -- and he's the hero -- trying to persuade his former wife, Lilli (Kathryn Grayson), to join him in a Broadway musical adaptation of ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' with music by his pal Cole Porter (Ron Randell). It helps that Mr. Keel seems to wince every time Ms. Grayson opens her mouth, because she is a pill, and a shrill pill at that.</p>
        <p>''Kate'' falls into the tradition of movies that ridiculed the egotism and self-absorbed bad judgment of stars. Lilli is a diva who decides to join the production only when the winsome hustler Lois (Ann Miller), wolf bait with a professionally cherubic smile, is offered the part that was written for her.</p>
        <p>In contrast with the self-conscious quality of the current Broadway production, this ''Kiss Me, Kate'' has an old-fashioned eagerness to entertain that nowadays could be perceived as naivete. And the boldness of Mr. Keel's opportunism is like something out of a Daffy Duck cartoon, though he is a charming lout. The director, George Sidney, generates constant motion -- the breathlessness of farce -- with people dashing in and out of rooms and, of course, the occasional item being tossed right into the camera. 3D may be one of the most adorable oddities in movie history, though irritating to those who wear glasses; you're bound to a get a reflection of the screen as you put the 3D glasses atop your own. (Maybe now is the time to have that laser eye surgery.)</p>
        <p>The picture does have its flat spots, like the intrusion of a pair of irritating comic-relief gangsters played by Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore, who seem to have wandered in from a production of ''Guys and Dolls'' next door. The picture's brio is quaint and disarming, for the most part getting its laughs when it needs them. And though Fosse was one of the dance ensemble, his big number, ''From This Moment On,'' has the irresistible sparkle of history being made on screen; you see how an artist can take what look like liabilities -- pigeon-toed gait, sunken chest, stooped shoulders -- and turn them into the loops of an original signature. The official choreographer is the extraordinary Hermes Pan, but Fosse provided the nascent artistry of a boy genius working out his first ideas right in front of you.</p>
        <p>''Kiss Me, Kate'' opens today and runs through July 20 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village. Tickets: $9; $5 for members. Daily screening times: 1:30, 4:15, 7 and 9:40 p.m. Information: (212) 727-8110.</p>
