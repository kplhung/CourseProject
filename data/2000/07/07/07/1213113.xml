        <p>Many artists categorized as outsiders have had complicated and not altogether felicitous relations with the professional art world. Gaston Chaissac (1910-64) is a case in point. Born in Avallon, France, the self-taught Chaissac worked at various trades before moving to Paris at age 27. There he met and was encouraged by professional artists like Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and, most decisively, Jean Dubuffet, who not only promoted him but also appropriated his ideas.</p>
        <p>The earliest and most intriguing works in this career survey are small pen-and-ink drawings from the late 1930's in which strangely abstracted figures are outlined by squiggly lines and filled in with intricate patterns of arcing hatch marks. These seem driven by a genuinely idiosyncratic urgency.</p>

        <p>Many artists categorized as outsiders have had complicated and not altogether felicitous relations with the professional art world. Gaston Chaissac (1910-64) is a case in point. Born in Avallon, France, the self-taught Chaissac worked at various trades before moving to Paris at age 27. There he met and was encouraged by professional artists like Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and, most decisively, Jean Dubuffet, who not only promoted him but also appropriated his ideas.</p>
        <p>The earliest and most intriguing works in this career survey are small pen-and-ink drawings from the late 1930's in which strangely abstracted figures are outlined by squiggly lines and filled in with intricate patterns of arcing hatch marks. These seem driven by a genuinely idiosyncratic urgency.</p>
        <p>In the paintings from the 1950's and 60's that predominate in this show there is less a feeling of private fantasy and more of self-conscious public performance. Chaissac knowingly mixes folksy primitivism and Modernist abstraction (Picasso was his role model), repeatedly reproducing his characteristic puzzlelike conglomerations of boldly outlined, brightly colored shapes, always adding cartoon faces to make rudimentary, mildly comical men.</p>
        <p>He works the same predictable magic on a tall, freestanding plank, a gnarly tree limb or torn scraps of wallpaper. Everything is tightly composed and buoyantly amusing, but not what you would call hair-raisingly visionary. It looks, rather, as if Chaissac is recycling tried and true formulas -- imitating himself just as a real professional would.</p>
