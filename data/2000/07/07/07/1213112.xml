        <p>Through July 21</p>
        <p>True to its title, ''Innuendo,'' one of the better group shows of the moment, generates a compelling ambience of understated eroticism. The 13-artist roster, selected by a painter, Doug Wada, includes mostly familiar names but a refreshingly diverse range of images and ideas.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece is a massive double bed boxed in by beautifully carved Gothic Revival-style panels by Brian Tolle. With padded leather prayer kneelers installed around its base, it slyly marries the sacred and the profane.</p>

        <p>True to its title, ''Innuendo,'' one of the better group shows of the moment, generates a compelling ambience of understated eroticism. The 13-artist roster, selected by a painter, Doug Wada, includes mostly familiar names but a refreshingly diverse range of images and ideas.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece is a massive double bed boxed in by beautifully carved Gothic Revival-style panels by Brian Tolle. With padded leather prayer kneelers installed around its base, it slyly marries the sacred and the profane.</p>
        <p>Images of women as objects of mystery and desire recur, but always with a twist. They include a yearbook-style portrait of a winsomely vacant girl by John Currin; intertwined female legs in a snappy, Pop-style gouache by John Wesley; a giant black-and-white head of a beautiful woman with huge eyes strangely rendered in color by Richard Phillips. Dana Hoey, in turn, cleverly plays on the male gaze in a photograph resembling an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch advertisement that updates the Judgment of Paris.</p>
        <p>Same sex desire is slyly implied in Felix Gonzalez-Torres's image of a pair of chairs printed on a jigsaw puzzle, Collier Schorr's photograph of boy wrestlers and, perhaps, Mr. Wada's iconic painting of a pair of red gym locker doors.</p>
        <p>A short digitized video by Shannon Kennedy is not explicitly erotic but is enthralling nevertheless. Shown on a small DVD screen, the four-minute loop gives us the wandering, camera-eye view of someone getting on and off a subway. It pauses over the interaction of a young man and his girlfriend, but it is the slowly streaming, slightly jerky sensuality of the whole that captivates.</p>
