        <p>Editorial on painting by George Harvey of intersection of Broadway and Houston Street in lower Manhattan and its evocation of early 19th-century New York City</p>

        <p>About 1835 an artist named George Harvey painted a small watercolor of the intersection of Broadway and Houston Street. The painting, called ''Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church, Broadway, New York,'' now belongs to the Museum of the City of New York and is reproduced in a new book called ''Picturing New York: The City From Its Beginnings to the Present,'' by Gloria Deak. Like his friend Washington Irving, whose house at Sunnyside he helped design, Harvey was a romantic, with a romantic's love of atmosphere. He painted what he called ''atmospheric landscapes.''</p>
        <p>''Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church'' is an atmospheric cityscape in the period of summer. The lamplighters are at work, and the lamps have just begun to take effect in the twilight. A saddlemaker stands under a canvas awning, lit by the shop's light spilling onto the walk. Carriages make their way across the cobbled intersection, as do pedestrians and two riders, one accompanied by a small dog, the other raising his horse in a levade. A squad of white-pantalooned soldiers is about to pass the doors of St. Thomas, whose twin towers frame a glowing leaded window. On the street darkness is taking hold, but above St. Thomas the sky is pale with midsummer. Looking at this painting you can feel the mixture of diffusion and directionality in the light, so strongly characteristic of the season, so familiar still.</p>

        <p>About 1835 an artist named George Harvey painted a small watercolor of the intersection of Broadway and Houston Street. The painting, called ''Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church, Broadway, New York,'' now belongs to the Museum of the City of New York and is reproduced in a new book called ''Picturing New York: The City From Its Beginnings to the Present,'' by Gloria Deak. Like his friend Washington Irving, whose house at Sunnyside he helped design, Harvey was a romantic, with a romantic's love of atmosphere. He painted what he called ''atmospheric landscapes.''</p>
        <p>''Night-Fall, St. Thomas Church'' is an atmospheric cityscape in the period of summer. The lamplighters are at work, and the lamps have just begun to take effect in the twilight. A saddlemaker stands under a canvas awning, lit by the shop's light spilling onto the walk. Carriages make their way across the cobbled intersection, as do pedestrians and two riders, one accompanied by a small dog, the other raising his horse in a levade. A squad of white-pantalooned soldiers is about to pass the doors of St. Thomas, whose twin towers frame a glowing leaded window. On the street darkness is taking hold, but above St. Thomas the sky is pale with midsummer. Looking at this painting you can feel the mixture of diffusion and directionality in the light, so strongly characteristic of the season, so familiar still.</p>
        <p>In 1835 there were perhaps a quarter-million people living in Manhattan. Forty-eight of them are visible in Harvey's watercolor, whose only unreality is the unreality of all figurative paintings, the protracted seizing of an instant. As Harvey depicts it, the intersection at Broadway and Houston might have been a village square, so orderly and placid does it seem, so rural that overarching sky. And yet you can sense the continuity that city streets always imply, the way they reach into an unseen distance.</p>
        <p>St. Thomas is long since gone from that spot -- it is now at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue -- and saddles and harnesses are no longer made anywhere in the city. The cobblestones have nearly all been taken up and the hand-lit streetlamps all taken down. The 48 people in Harvey's painting, and their quarter-million neighbors, have all passed into the oblivion on which the present serenely rides. Three tides of traffic now cross each other at Broadway and Houston, and every pedestrian who pauses there for a light carries within him an intuitive sense of the city's volume, its voltage, just as the pedestrians in Harvey's watercolor surely did. That is perhaps the only thing that has not changed in 165 years. That, and on fair summer nights, the pale western sky.</p>
