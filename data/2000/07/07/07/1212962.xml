        <p>R2D2, meet Barbie. Vintage toys and dolls are in, not that they ever went out. There are specialty auctions, Web sites, collector clubs, swap meets. There are sales four times a year in Gaithersburg, Md., as well as the twice yearly Atlantique Fairs, sales that attract tens of thousands to Atlantic City. There are more than 80 dealers on nadda.org, the Web site of the National Antique Doll Dealers Association.</p>
        <p>''It's a baby boomer thing,'' said George Glastris, head of the toy and doll department at Skinner, the Boston auction house. ''It's about nostalgia and recapturing our youth, even for 35-year-old yuppies like me. The robots are a guy thing. Dolls are for girls.''</p>

        <p>R2D2, meet Barbie. Vintage toys and dolls are in, not that they ever went out. There are specialty auctions, Web sites, collector clubs, swap meets. There are sales four times a year in Gaithersburg, Md., as well as the twice yearly Atlantique Fairs, sales that attract tens of thousands to Atlantic City. There are more than 80 dealers on nadda.org, the Web site of the National Antique Doll Dealers Association.</p>
        <p>''It's a baby boomer thing,'' said George Glastris, head of the toy and doll department at Skinner, the Boston auction house. ''It's about nostalgia and recapturing our youth, even for 35-year-old yuppies like me. The robots are a guy thing. Dolls are for girls.''</p>
        <p>He said tomorrow's auction at Skinner, with 694 lots, is its biggest toy sale to date. The sale includes wind-up toys, lithographed tinplate vehicles, dolls, 18th-century Neapolitan creche figures, toy soldiers, cast iron banks, board games, puzzles and robots.</p>
        <p>Vintage toys are evaluated according to rarity and condition. ''Great age is not important for toys, dolls and collectibles,'' Carol Prisant writes in the ''Antiques Roadshow Primer.'' ''Toys made before World War II are considered 'antique,' while toys made after the war are 'modern.' ''</p>
        <p>Old toys need not be expensive. Skinner has given many lots $200 estimates, though not the star ones. These include rare robots like the Robby Space Patrol. (The word robot, coined by the Czech writer Karel Capek, comes from the Czech word robota, meaning compulsory labor like that of a serf.) Robby the Robot was made famous by the classic 1956 science-fiction film ''Forbidden Planet.'' A robot who drove a space vehicle across a windswept alien planet, he has become an icon among robot collectors.</p>
        <p>''He's also rare,'' Mr. Glastris said. ''I've never sold one before.''</p>
        <p>Mark Bergin, a private dealer in New Hampshire who specializes in vintage robots and space toys (www.bergintoys.com), said: ''Today, kids and Generation X, at least the 15- to 20-year-olds, are turned on by them. They are even showing up in MTV videos.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Bergin, robots represent not nostalgia but the future and the unknown. ''These robots are futuristic in form and design,'' he said. ''The toys are 50 years old, and we still don't have real robots yet. We are just on the verge.''</p>
        <p>Robots are also popular among graphic artists. ''It's because they have a 'Pulp Fiction' kind of art,'' Mr. Bergin said. ''Robots and robot boxes probably have better graphics than any other toy.''</p>
        <p>This may explain the astronomical prices robots can fetch. Sotheby's New York sold a Robby Machine Man for $74,000 in December 1997. That set a record for a robot sold at auction, but Mr. Bergin said he had sold robots for more. At the moment he has a red Robby Space Trooper in its original box for $7,500 and a black Robby Space Trooper without its box for $1,500. He recommended that would-be collectors read ''Future Toys,'' by Antoni Emchowicz and Paul Nunneley (New Cavendish Books).</p>
        <p>A quick survey on the Web proves you can also buy other movie-star toy robots made more recently, including a robot inspired by the Maria in Fritz Lang's 1926 German film ''Metropolis''; Hal 9000, from ''2001: A Space Odyssey''; both 3CPO and R2D2 from ''Star Wars''; and Vanessa Rembot from ''Austin Powers.'' Robots rule!</p>
        <p>Dolls have been cherished since men lived in caves. ''Dolls are the second most highly collected antiques, after stamps and coins,'' said Dorothy McGonagle, the doll specialist at Skinner.</p>
        <p>They tend to be classified according to the material used to make the head: wood, china, cloth, wax and plastic, among others. ''The head is 90 percent of a doll,'' Mrs. McGonagle said. ''Some manufacturers made only heads, and others made the bodies. Then dolls were sent off to the couturier for dressing. In the late 1800's, Paris shops like Au Nain Bleu acted as a middleman. It would have samples, so the customer could specify what head and dress she wanted. They must have had teams of seamstresses making the outfits.</p>
        <p>''Dolls are a mirror of society,'' Mrs. McGonagle continued. ''Dolls reflect what is going on in a culture at a given time. In the 19th century, for example, France was the fashion capital of the world, and costume was an important part of French life and the French economy. So the French produced fashion dolls, dolls depicted as upper-class ladies in couture. They are the predecessors of Barbie, the fashion doll of the 20th century.''</p>
        <p>Manhattan specialty shops like Second Childhood on Bleecker Street and Iris Brown Antique Dolls on East 57th Street sell such dolls. Richard Wright, a dealer in Birchrunville, Pa., also has a selection of rare European toys and dolls.</p>
        <p>There are two schools of thought about fashion dolls, said Mrs. McGonagle, author of ''The Dolls of Jules Nicolas Steiner.'' ''Some say they were a way France exported its fashions. I think these dolls were to play with. They were made at a time when the middle class was burgeoning and people had money. It was the right time for a huge development in doll making. Such dolls came with accessories: crosses, enameled watches, rings, rosary beads and necklaces, to name a few.''</p>
        <p>Iris Brown disagrees. ''These dolls are not really for children,'' she said. ''They have survived because they were put on shelves. Girls just looked at them.''</p>
        <p>Until the 19th century, dolls tended to look like miniature adults, probably, Mrs. McGonagle said, because children were expected to act like adults. ''Early dolls were also very pale, because ladies stayed inside,'' she added. ''Later on you see healthier coloring.'' Dolls were adults dressed as children until the 1870's, when the child began to be glorified and doll forms were rendered as babies and children.</p>
        <p>French companies like Bru, Jumeau and Steiner all produced fine child dolls. Lot 171 in the Skinner sale is a rare French Bru Bebe doll called Zepherine from the late 1870's. Her beautifully modeled head and delicate (repainted) hands are bisque, while the body is made of kid leather. She looks very grown up, with protruding breasts and a (replacement) blond wig framing her face. She has enormous cornflower blue eyes made of paperweight glass, arched eyebrows and long eyelashes that have been painted on. She wears her original cotton chemise underdress, which originally would have had a fabulous outfit over it. The estimated selling price for the doll is $8,000 to $12,000.</p>
        <p>Collectors have arcane criteria when judging dolls. ''A good doll, like a good woman, keeps her eyes open and her mouth shut,'' Mrs. McGonagle said, quoting an adage.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Bergin, a robot is really an industrial doll. ''They mesh the computer age with the human age,'' he said. For him, the only good doll (or robot) is one that can move in mysterious ways. To each his own.</p>
