        <p>Running back Fred Lane of the Indianapolis Colts was found dead in his home outside Charlotte, N.C., yesterday afternoon. The police said that his wife had shot him. He was 24.</p>
        <p>Lane had been the Carolina Panthers' leading rusher before being traded to the Colts in April. The police released few details about the shooting. A police spokesman, Keith Bridges, said that Lane's wife, Deidra, was being questioned.</p>
        <p>''The investigation to this point has revealed that Deidra Lane shot her husband during a domestic dispute,'' the police said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Capt. Chuck Johnson of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department told The Associated Press: ''At this point there's no arrest, there's no nothing. It's just an investigation.''</p>
        <p>Lane's father, Fred Lane Sr., said the couple had been experiencing marital problems. Last March, Lane was named in a domestic complaint filed by his wife. She said he had snatched a necklace from her neck during an argument, causing her to fall.</p>
        <p>Deidra Lane, 25, was with a 7-day-old infant while being questioned at the police station. The Lanes also have a 5-year-old son. Their house was decorated with pink balloons and a pink stork.</p>
        <p>Lane's death comes at a time when the National Football League has spent considerable resources trying to clean up its image and encouraging its players to stay out of trouble.</p>
        <p>Lane was one of the most talented players in the short history of the Panthers, having gained 2,004 yards with the team.</p>
        <p>The Panthers suspended Lane for one game in 1998, after he made a lewd gesture to fans during a game against the Jets at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>Lane was indicted earlier this week by a grand jury in Jackson, Tenn., where the player attended college, on misdemeanor drug charges related to an arrest Feb. 3.</p>
        <p>During that incident, the police had found a loaded .22-caliber assault-style rifle in the trunk of Lane's car after stopping him for driving slowly on a side street. While searching Lane and three passengers, officers found 1.3 grams of marijuana on Lane and 4 grams of marijuana on one of his passengers. Weapons charges against Lane were eventually dropped.</p>
        <p>According to several N.F.L. team executives, the Panthers were uncertain whether they could count on Lane. Carolina officials began trade discussions with several teams, including the Colts.</p>
        <p>Some teams, those executives said, began their own background investigations of Lane and ultimately shared the Panthers' concerns, especially after hearing accusations that Lane had missed at least one team flight and had been late or missed several team meetings.</p>
        <p>While other teams decided not to trade for Lane, the Colts thought they could rehabilitate his career. Lane was scheduled to be the backup for the Pro Bowl runner Edgerrin James.</p>
        <p>Lane had spent the past couple of weeks at the family home in Nashville, where he was born in 1975, but visited Charlotte briefly a week ago.</p>
        <p>Lane flew from Tennessee to Charlotte yesterday, just hours before he was shot, his father said.</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-10-inch, 205-pound Lane was not picked in the 1997 N.F.L. draft, but shortly after the draft ended, he was signed by the Panthers. Lane had starred at tiny Lane College in Tennessee, where he finished near the top of the nation's Division II rushing and scoring statistics.</p>
        <p>As a pro, Lane set rookie records with the Panthers in 1997 before becoming a starter and the team's main ball carrier the following season.</p>
        <p>These have been troubling times for the N.F.L. and its players. Another former Panther, Rae Carruth, the team's top draft pick in 1997, faces a murder trial in the shooting of his pregnant wife. Prosecutors in Atlanta had accused linebacker Ray Lewis of the Baltimore Ravens of complicity in the stabbing deaths of two men after the Super Bowl. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of lying to the police investigators during his trial last month, and murder and assault charges against him were dropped.</p>
        <p>Player troubles away from the field were a major topic for N.F.L. owners at their winter and spring meetings. Concerned that its image was being tarnished, the league expanded its violent crime policy (now called the ''personal conduct policy''). The league now screens incoming players at the annual scouting combine for potential problems.</p>
        <p>The league has also ordered mandatory counseling for at-risk players.</p>
