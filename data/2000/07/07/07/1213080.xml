        <p>VENUS WILLIAMS was drenched with sweat. Her signature braids, her one-piece tennis outfit, all dripping with the effort of a grueling semifinal victory.</p>
        <p>She was walking off Center Court at the All England Club, where she had achieved the greatest triumph of her career. She had reached the women's championship round at Wimbledon, taken a huge step closer to fulfilling a dream and the promise of an intriguing career. She had came one step closer to winning her first Grand Slam singles title at tennis' most hallowed address.</p>
        <p>There was one problem. Her success had come at the expense of the person she loved more than anyone else in the world: she had just beaten her little sister Serena, 6-2, 7-6 (3).</p>
        <p>When the match ended on Serena's double fault, the sisters looked at each other, frozen. For a split second, it seemed as if they did not know how to react -- Serena to her sister's victory, Venus to her sister's loss. There was no Venus celebration, no fists pumped in the air. That was the most distressing part of the day.</p>
        <p>Part of a fan's joy is sharing the victor's triumph. Anyone who might have tuned in after that final point and seen the sisters' faces would have thought this was the first match in history in which both players had lost.</p>
        <p>For all those who think their matches have been scripted, that moment crystallized just how badly Serena wanted to win. And how difficult this must have been for Venus.</p>
        <p>This sister-versus-sister matchup had been hyped for good reason: It was the first time in more than 100 years that two sisters had faced each other this deep into a Grand Slam draw.  Their race and their background added drama.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the buildup, this match wasn't pretty. Intriguing, yes. Riveting, yes. But far too intense to be called fun to watch.</p>
        <p>For everybody who has a sister or a brother, this match may have hit a nerve. It contained all of the elements of a sibling rivalry: competition, empathy, envy and guilt.</p>
        <p>Zina Garrison, who reached the finals at Wimbledon a decade ago, knew exactly what was taking place. She was the last African-American woman to reach a Grand Slam final before the Williams sisters, but before this match was even half over, you knew this was not about pioneering; it was about family.</p>
        <p>Garrison, a mentor to Serena, said the younger sister had been in awe of the older sister.</p>
        <p>''No matter what -- win, lose or draw -- you're going to be the little sister,'' she said. ''I know from being the youngest, no matter what I accomplish, or what I do, my big sisters felt that they could dominate me.''</p>
        <p>Garrison added that sibling rivalry was only part of what unfolded here. ''Today, Venus basically showed that she really wants this tournament,'' said Garrison, who attended the match. ''No matter who she played today, she would have won.''</p>
        <p>Yet Venus said that during change-overs she found herself thinking about her sister. ''I'm sitting over there and I'm thinking, 'Does Serena have enough sports drink?'</p>
        <p>''I've always taken care of Serena,'' she said. ''That's the way it's always been. I'm the one doing the driving late at night when we came home from school. I was always driving with her asleep. I'm the big sister and that's the way it will always be.'' Venus turned 20 last month; Serena will be 19 in September.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it's really bitter,'' Venus said of winning. ''But someone had to move on. It was either going to be me or Serena.''</p>
        <p>Richard Williams said he tried to comfort his youngest child. He said he told Serena: ''Just think of how many people would love to be in your position today: you're on Center Court in the most famous stadium in the world.''</p>
        <p>He didn't see the match, choosing to stay away. Yet he still felt the pain.</p>
        <p>''When I heard she had tears in her eyes, I felt even sadder,'' he said of Serena. ''I almost had tears in my eyes for my baby. It's been a tough day over all.''</p>
        <p>Will the sisters keep playing these stressful matches? Or will the sister-to-sister matchups lose some of the edge? ''I think it will become less spectacular,'' Venus said. ''Most of all, Serena and I have to promise ourselves to start playing solid tennis every time so that we can be No. 1 and No. 2, then meet in the finals. It will be a natural thing.''</p>
        <p>Not to mention, a relief. A victory shouldn't be this heartbreaking.</p>
        <p>Before the sisters shook hands with the umpire, Venus put her arm around her younger sister and whispered something. What she said framed the match, the day, the mood. Venus said: ''Let's get out of here, Serena.''</p>
