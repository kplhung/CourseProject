        <p>A former senior adviser to politicians and city officials, James S. Vlasto is an old hand at moving the stubborn gears of government.</p>
        <p>And yesterday in a Manhattan courtroom, Mr. Vlasto witnessed his most compelling triumph: the prison sentencing of Sylvia S. Mitchell, a woman who was convicted of killing his elderly uncle, Andrew G. Vlasto, with lethal drug cocktails in a plot to loot his $500,000 retirement nest egg.</p>
        <p>Andrew Vlasto, 85, a member of a prominent Greek-American family, died in 1993, three months after a sham marriage to Ms. Mitchell, who was 57 years his junior. Suspecting that Ms. Mitchell had tricked his enfeebled uncle into a wedding ceremony and then had poisoned him, James Vlasto dogged her trail for six years.</p>
        <p>He helped uncover evidence about barbiturates and opiates administered to his uncle, tracked Ms. Mitchell around the country after his uncle's death, blocked her from obtaining all but $80,000 of his uncle's wealth and pressed state prosecutors to investigate the case.</p>
        <p>The campaign by Mr. Vlasto ended yesterday when Justice Bonnie Wittner of State Supreme Court in Manhattan sentenced Ms. Mitchell to 5 to 15 years in prison after she pleaded guilty to charges of manslaughter, grand larceny and perjury.</p>
        <p>James Vlasto, 66, who was press secretary for former Gov. Hugh L. Carey and for former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez, addressed the judge before the sentencing. As Ms. Mitchell cast her eyes downward, away from Mr. Vlasto, he asserted that his uncle's death had been orchestrated by her.</p>
        <p>''He had no chance to call for help,'' Mr. Vlasto said. ''He did not have to die.''</p>
        <p>Imposing the maximum sentence possible under a plea bargaining deal, Justice Wittner described the homicide as a ''sad, tragic case'' of a vulnerable elderly man victimized to siphon his estate. But Justice Wittner said she doubted that Ms. Mitchell had been the mastermind of the scheme.</p>
        <p>''I believe she had co-conspirators,'' Justice Wittner added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell declined to speak before sentencing. Arthur W. Greig, her lawyer -- the sixth she has retained since her arrest in April 1999 -- acknowledged that she had been reckless in feeding drugs to Andrew Vlasto. ''But she did not administer the drugs with the intention of killing Mr. Vlasto,'' the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Outside the courtroom, Mr. Greig, in an interview, identified Ms. Mitchell as a member of the Tene-Bimbo Gypsy clan and said that she was ''a victim of circumstances involving traditional Gypsy relationships.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greig said Ms. Mitchell, who is the mother of five children, might have been manipulated by Ephrem Bimbo, with whom she was living when she met Andrew Vlasto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bimbo, who lives in Las Vegas, has an unlisted telephone number and could not be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Castleman, the head of the investigation division in the Manhattan district attorney's office, said he would not challenge Justice Wittner's statement that Ms. Mitchell had accomplices. But he said prosecutors lacked evidence to bring charges against anyone else.</p>
        <p>Andrew Vlasto was a member of the family that in 1894 founded The Atlantis, the first Greek-language newspaper in the United States. Before coming to the United States in 1945 at 37, Mr. Vlasto was a lawyer and banker in Greece. He worked as an editor and production supervisor at The Atlantis until the newspaper ceased publication in 1974.</p>
        <p>A slightly built man with wavy gray hair, he appeared to be a confirmed bachelor. After retiring in 1989, Mr. Vlasto managed frugally on the nest egg he had nurtured and lived in a $252-a-month one-bedroom apartment in Chelsea at 41 West 24th Street. He got along without a television set, passing the time playing the piano in his apartment and reading.</p>
        <p>In October 1993, a neighbor of Mr. Vlasto's called James Vlasto to tell him that his uncle had been taken to Bellevue Hospital Center. At the hospital, James Vlasto and his brother, George, learned that their uncle had been married three months earlier to Ms. Mitchell. Hospital officials barred them from seeing their uncle, saying that his wife had prohibited bedside visits by anyone but herself.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 10, 1993, three weeks after being admitted to the hospital, Mr. Vlasto died. Over the objections of Ms. Mitchell, an autopsy was performed and Mr. Vlasto's death was attributed by the city medical examiner's office to pneumonia and toxic infection complicated by an overdose of barbiturates and opiates, drugs that had not been administered by the hospital's staff. The autopsy also found that he had Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that he might have been unable to care for himself.</p>
        <p>Andrew Vlasto did not leave a will and Ms. Mitchell's attempt to obtain his entire estate was blocked by James Vlasto. In a 1994 settlement, she was allowed to keep what remained of the $80,000 withdrawn from his bank accounts but waived rights to the rest of his estate, and she was prohibited from using Vlasto as her family name.</p>
        <p>In pleading guilty to the perjury charge, Ms. Mitchell admitted that during the dispute over the estate she had lied in a court deposition by failing to acknowledge that she was married to another man, Mr. Bimbo, when she married Mr. Vlasto.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell said in the 1994 deposition that she grew up in California and met Mr. Vlasto at a McDonald's restaurant in Chelsea in 1991. She claimed that she worked for him as a house cleaner and that in 1993 he proposed marriage and oversaw the wedding arrangements.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said they expected Ms. Mitchell to serve 10 years of her sentence before she would be eligible for parole.</p>
