        <p>Pete Sampras's latest injury has all but been dusted for prints and sent to the lab. For more than a week, he has described the tendinitis living inside of his lower left shin, but it has been treated as an allegation and not a fact.</p>
        <p>Not everyone believes Sampras is in pain. And if he is, no one wants to hear about it from a six-time Wimbledon champion who has tip-toed through five unseeded players on his way to another nonthreatening opponent in Friday's semifinal.</p>
        <p>The unassuming Vladimir Voltchkov -- a penny-pinching qualifier who had to borrow shorts and shoes during his extended stay at Wimbledon -- is the only player in Sampras's way of reaching the final.</p>
        <p>''When players go out there and see Pete Sampras totally dominate, it's aggravating to have him say he's not feeling right,'' John McEnroe, a television analyst and the Davis Cup captain, said. ''Pete talks about it, and it's like he's saying: 'If I lose, it's because of the injury. But by the way, I'm about to be in the finals again.' ''</p>
        <p>Sampras could even make history. The injury has created diversion from his chase of Roy Emerson's record even though Sampras is in pouncing position to win his 13th Grand Slam event. First, there is Voltchkov. Andre Agassi may await. But the second-seeded Agassi has a far more treacherous path to the final. He will play 12th-seeded Patrick Rafter, who is playing his best tennis since having shoulder surgery in October.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to see Pat playing well,'' said Agassi, who leads the head-to-head matchup with Rafter, 7-3, which includes his semifinal victory here against the Aussie last year. ''I think he's a great athlete with a lot to offer the sport of tennis. He's one of the best competitors out there, if not the best.''</p>
        <p>Agassi also possesses untouchable desire. With his instincts and quick hands, with his brainpower and fancy footwork, he has unveiled his magic over the fortnight. He escaped a five-set match against Todd Martin in the second round, then dodged the atomic serve of Mark Philippoussis in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>''The No. 1 thing against Andre is that you have to serve well,'' said Rafter, whose kick-serve can be problematic for Agassi. ''And you've got to serve well all day. If you can do that, you've got a chance.''</p>
        <p>Voltchkov's odds to advance are slim. But the 22-year-old from Belarus doesn't seem flustered by the occasion, just grateful for the chance to double his career winnings.</p>
        <p>''To play Pete in the semifinals of Wimbledon, what else do you wish for?'' said Voltchkov, who will make $193,000 for stepping on the court. ''It's like a dream come true.''</p>
        <p>Outside Concerns</p>
        <p>John McEnroe's concerns about Pete Sampras's injury extend beyond Wimbledon. With a Davis Cup matchup in Spain two weeks away, the captain of the team doesn't know if Sampras will be available.</p>
        <p>''I get the suspicion that there won't be good news at the end of the day for Davis Cup,'' McEnroe said.</p>
