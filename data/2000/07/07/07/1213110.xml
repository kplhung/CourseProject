        <p>Through July 21</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with the three-decade career of the photographer, writer and underground German filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger, these two exhibitions make a memorable introduction to her strange and various sensibility, which ranges effortlessly and extravagantly between ethnographic documentary and Surrealist feminist fantasy, sometimes within the same film.</p>
        <p>At the Goethe Institute, the artist's photographs from ''Taiga,'' her 1992 film (and 1993 book) about the disappearing world of the Shaman and Tuvan peoples of the Taiga region of northern Mongolia, feature majestic landscapes, pristine white yurts and the inhabitants, who ride both horses and tamed reindeer.</p>

        <p>For those unfamiliar with the three-decade career of the photographer, writer and underground German filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger, these two exhibitions make a memorable introduction to her strange and various sensibility, which ranges effortlessly and extravagantly between ethnographic documentary and Surrealist feminist fantasy, sometimes within the same film.</p>
        <p>At the Goethe Institute, the artist's photographs from ''Taiga,'' her 1992 film (and 1993 book) about the disappearing world of the Shaman and Tuvan peoples of the Taiga region of northern Mongolia, feature majestic landscapes, pristine white yurts and the inhabitants, who ride both horses and tamed reindeer.</p>
        <p>At Zwirner, stills from Ms. Ottinger's loosely plotted feature films line the walls, revealing a penchant for over-the-top spectacle and campy melodrama that has been likened to that of Fellini and Bunuel, but is distinguished by its relentlessly Baroque sumptuousness and high-spirited feminism.</p>
        <p>For American viewers, a suite of photographs from ''Ticket of No Return'' (1979), showing a well-dressed alcoholic played by Tabea Blumenshein, an Ottinger regular, will bring to mind Cindy Sherman. The scenes from ''Madame X -- An Absolute Ruler'' (1977) and ''Johanna D'Arc of Mongolia'' (1988) may evoke Matthew Barney. The most riveting images are several from ''Dorian Gray in the Mirror of the Yellow Press'' (1984), which frame elaborately costumed actors within an ornately painted proscenium arch set in rugged terrain.</p>
        <p>Most disturbing are those from Ms. Ottinger's rarely seen 1981 cult classic ''Freak Orlando'' (which will be screened tonight at 7 at  Anthology Film Archives in the East Village). Wildly sensational in the use of dwarfs, Siamese twins, a two-headed pig and a limbless woman, these images attest to a vision as transgressive and perverse as it is celebratory and inclusive.</p>
