        <p>Asserting that public schools have a duty to teach moral rectitude, the Colorado State Board of Education today passed a resolution that encourages schools to display the national motto ''In God we trust.''</p>
        <p>Before the measure passed, with five Republicans on the board voting in favor and the lone Democrat dissenting, supporters insisted that the motto reflected a founding principle of the country, not any religion, and, therefore, did not blur the constitutional line separating church and state.</p>
        <p>''Our nation has lost its way on the road to virtue and moral character,'' said Clair Orr of Kersey, Colo., the board chairman and sponsor of the resolution, who characterized the motto as no less sacred than words he quoted from the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address and the pledge of allegiance.  ''We have a moral obligation to educate our children in the truth.''</p>
        <p>As the only opponent to the resolution, Gully Stanford of Denver said he agreed with the majority's view that ''In God we trust,'' introduced on currency in 1864 and made the national motto by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, conveyed the vision of a country founded on Judeo-Christian values.</p>
        <p>But in an increasingly diverse society that includes followers of other religions, as well as nonbelievers, Mr. Stanford said the resolution was insensitive, divisive, distracting and ill-timed in light of the Supreme Court decision that affirmed the unconstitutional nature of prayer in public schools.</p>
        <p>The resolution may not be intended as ideological, he told his colleagues, ''but it will be interpreted that way at this time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stanford also said the values embraced by the national motto, religious or otherwise, could be taught just as effectively and more appropriately in history and civics classes.</p>
        <p>The board heard no public comments before voting. Lynn M. Fontanier, a spokeswoman for the board, said that the public had several months to submit comments and that only two opponents had emerged. The board, Ms. Fontanier said, received arguments against the measure from Robert R. Tiernan, a Denver lawyer who has been involved in several federal lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the motto's use on currency, and the Mountain States chapter of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which characterized the resolution as unconstitutional, insensitive and exclusionary.</p>
        <p>Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, an organization based in Washington, accused the board of ''trying to meddle in the religious lives of young children.''</p>
