        <p>Something is fouling the air in the Middlesex County clerk's office, and it is not just the dust.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the dust is apparent. In what is known as the computer room on the sixth floor of the old county administration building here, dust bunnies as big as mice dotted the floor this afternoon. Fans were coated with dusty fibers, and tiny tumbleweeds rolled across tables where title searchers used computer monitors to peruse digital images of mortgages, deeds and other property records.</p>
        <p>One searcher, Ann Sardone, said the dust got so bad that, after a coughing fit on June 26, she began wearing a paper surgical mask. ''I said: 'That's it, I'm going to Rite Aid. I need a pollen mask,' '' said Ms. Sardone, 47, of Metuchen, a past president of the Middlesex County Title Searchers Guild. ''When I first walked in and people started laughing at me, I said, 'Go ahead, laugh all you want.' ''</p>
        <p>But the mask is no laughing matter to county officials, who sent the guild's lawyer a letter suggesting that it was ''contributing to a hostile environment.'' The county clerk, Elaine Flynn, said the mask could give the public a false impression that there was something seriously wrong with the office's air, or with Ms. Sardone.</p>
        <p>''She certainly makes people who are new to the place question what's going on, and we want them to feel comfortable in our facilities,'' Ms. Flynn said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sardone contends that there is indeed something wrong with the air, and the small office's squabble over her mask became big news today when reported by The Star-Ledger and The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>But county officials said that they never told Ms. Sardone to stop wearing the mask, and they added that the dispute, rather than being clear cut, was about as murky and tangled as those dust bunnies.</p>
        <p>They pointed out that the Title Searchers Guild filed a lawsuit against the county in October, claiming that the digital recordkeeping system's technical problems made the searchers' exacting work all the more nerve-racking and time-consuming.</p>
        <p>In two recent incidents, county employees complained to the county clerk about subtle and blatant hostility from guild members, including Ms. Sardone.</p>
        <p>County officials would not elaborate. But guild members provided a copy of a June 28 memo outlining the more recent report of perceived subtle hostility, submitted to the county clerk by one of her employees.</p>
        <p>''On Thursday, June 6, 2000,'' the memo read, ''while standing in the lobby 6th floor of the Admin. Building, Ann Sardone walked out of the map room and just stood there and stared at me in a very menacing manner.''</p>
        <p>In response to that memo, the deputy county counsel, Benjamin D. Leibowitz, sent the guild's lawyer a letter saying that Ms. Sardone's mask ''could be viewed as contributing to a hostile environment created by plaintiffs in the clerk's office.'' He would not elaborate on the letter today.</p>
        <p>Asked about the dust that Ms. Sardone says led her to start wearing the mask, the county clerk, Ms. Flynn, said that the record rooms were cleaned regularly and that no one else had ever complained.</p>
        <p>There are also political undercurrents to the dispute. Ms. Flynn is a Democrat up for re-election as clerk in November. Ms. Sardone is a Republican member of the City Council in Metuchen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sardone, a smoker who conceded that cigarettes might have contributed to her coughing, denied that her wearing the mask had anything to do with politics or the lawsuit. But the guild's lawyer, Kevin Hahn, said that whatever her motives, she had a clear right to wear the mask.</p>
        <p>''Even if she was sending a message, it's freedom of speech,'' Mr. Hahn said. ''As far as I know, the First Amendment is alive and well in Middlesex County.''</p>
