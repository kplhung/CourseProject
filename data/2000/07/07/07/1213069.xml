        <p>With the Democratic Convention around the corner, I would like to join those offering advice to Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore's next, and maybe last, best chance to re-energize his campaign will come with his selection of his vice-presidential running mate, and I know whom he should choose.</p>
        <p>Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>No, really, think about it for a moment. Bill Clinton, with all his detractors, is still the most popular and interesting politician in the country, and he is a far better campaigner, debater and all-around politician than any of the no-name Democratic governors whose names have been bandied about as possible running mates for Mr. Gore. While many voters won't admit it, they would love to vote for Mr. Clinton again. He has kept us entertained in this age of microchips and markets, and there is no Democrat who drives Republicans more crazy. Without blinking an eye, he takes 50 percent of all the Republicans' best ideas and then accuses them of being extremists for wanting the other half. What other Democrat can get away with that?</p>
        <p>Think of what Mr. Clinton could do to energize the Gore campaign: He would certainly help Mr. Gore overcome his problem with women voters, and, have no doubt, Mr. Clinton, who knows every issue inside out, would destroy any Republican vice-presidential candidate in a debate. For that matter, Mr. Clinton could eat George W. Bush for breakfast in a debate and not even know he ate him. And, be honest, who does a funeral better than Bill Clinton? That's the vice president's most important task.</p>
        <p>Also, for pure entertainment, what could be better? The vice president breaks tie votes in the Senate. So if Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected as senator from New York and Bill Clinton as vice president, they might actually square off on a key vote. We're talking a ''War of the Roses'' kind of deal right there on the Senate floor. C-Span would instantly become the most widely watched television network in the country. Who needs ''Survivor'' when we could have Clinton vs. Clinton -- live?</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also solves another problem. He's already had his background -- not to mention his body parts, body fluids and DNA -- checked by everyone from Paula Jones to the F.B.I. So Mr. Gore wouldn't have to worry about any surprises coming out of his closet -- like draft-dodging, pot-smoking, philandering or land speculating -- since the Clinton closet has already been opened and emptied twice over. How many potential vice-presidential candidates can say they've survived an impeachment inquiry? We're talking vetted here, folks. Though Mr. Clinton may be disbarred in Arkansas (isn't that an oxymoron?), he has never been convicted of anything. That should count for something.</p>
        <p>And as taxpayers we have to love this idea, because Bill Clinton for vice president is good for the budget too. Ex-presidents get Secret Service protection for life. But if Mr. Clinton was vice president, he would get the V.P.'s Secret Service detail and would not need one of his own, so the country would save millions by having to maintain one less Secret Service team. It's a two-for-one deal.</p>
        <p>There is no question that Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton get along, so there are no worries there, and there is also no question that Mr. Clinton would love the job. First of all, he wouldn't have to move to that Potemkin house in New York but could spend four more years in government housing at the vice president's residence on Massachusetts Avenue. Second, it would give Mr. Clinton a job, now that he appears to be on the verge of losing his license to practice law. And being vice president has got to be more fun than being on the board of Disney. I mean, whom would you rather report to -- Al Gore or Michael Eisner?</p>
        <p>It would also solve Mr. Clinton's golf problem. As a private citizen he would want to join a private golf club, but that could be difficult because few clubs want the hassle of having all those Secret Service agents with sniper rifles sitting in trees and roaming the fairways. But if Mr. Clinton was vice president no club would turn him away from the first tee, and he would have much more time to work on his game. Look how good a golfer Dan Quayle is today.</p>
        <p>Yes, yes. I know, Clinton-haters believe that Mr. Clinton should be punished, not be made vice president. But aren't they the same thing?</p>
