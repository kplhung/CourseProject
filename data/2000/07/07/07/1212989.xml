        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Whether or not the latest test for a national missile defense system ''succeeds'' (news article, July 6) -- and considering that the conditions for this test have been so modified from real-world conditions that such success is a near certainty -- is beside the point.</p>
        <p>The reality is that the United States does not need the proposed system. As history has shown, new ''advances'' like this one -- even when they are designed well enough to function properly -- do nothing more than open up a new (and costly) arms race, with the result that the new system is obsolete practically before it is put into operation.</p>
        <p>The missile system would waste billions and billions of dollars, while at the same time undermining existing and pending treaties that actually do what the system would fail to do: make the world a safer place.</p>
        <p>CRAIG BUTLER  New York, July 6, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director, Fund for New Priorities in America.</p>
