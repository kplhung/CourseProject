        <p>After mounting pressure from Western governments whose philanthropy keeps the Palestinian Authority afloat, Yasir Arafat's government has divulged details of its long-hidden investment portfolio, and now says that its next step will be to dismantle the fund entirely.</p>
        <p>The man who has been the keeper of Mr. Arafat's investment accounts, Mohammed Rachid, said in a rare, on-the-record conversation with journalists here tonight that he will preside over the dissolution of the financial empire he methodically amassed at Mr. Arafat's behest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachid, who had managed to keep himself and the Palestinian government's business dealings shielded from public scrutiny for years, pledged that the holdings would either be divested or transferred to a new, publicly accountable Palestinian Investment Fund by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>According to an audited statement sent to the International Monetary Fund in June and published this month on the Palestinian Authority's Web site, the holding company now boasts assets of $345 million, including $292 million in equity stakes in three dozen companies. Its one-third share in an Israeli-patronized casino, valued at $60 million, is its largest and most lucrative investment.</p>
        <p>The liquidation of these holdings will not be entirely voluntary, Mr. Rachid acknowledged tonight. Western governments had refused to continue subsidizing Palestinian budget deficits unless all government revenues and expenditures were consolidated into a single ''transparent'' budget account, he said.</p>
        <p>''We have been hiding information,'' Mr. Rachid said. ''Maybe it wasn't wise.'' But he said that this secrecy was evidence not of corruption, but of inexperience in public administration and Mr. Arafat's desire to protect profitable investments from his own free-spending bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge difference between monopolies and corruption,'' Mr. Rachid said, adding that it was unrealistic to expect the emerging Palestinian state to conduct business ''like a small Switzerland.''</p>
        <p>The investments were detailed last month in the audit. In that report, Mr. Rachid's Palestinian Commercial Services Company, which is owned by the Palestinian Authority but not supervised by its legislature or finance ministry, was revealed to control large minority stakes in a Jericho casino, a Ramallah Coca-Cola bottler, a Bethlehem convention center and myriad other private businesses, plus full ownership of a cement plant that had long enjoyed a government-protected monopoly.</p>
        <p>The company was also, until recently, the direct recipient of sales taxes -- more than $500 million in the past two years alone -- collected by Israel but owed to the Palestinian Authority under the 1993 Oslo peace accords.</p>
        <p>The tax receipts had been deposited in a Tel Aviv bank account controlled by Mr. Rachid and Mr. Arafat, a practice ended by Israel in April after persistent complaints by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions charged with monitoring Palestinian finances. Some of the tax money was used by Mr. Arafat for undisclosed official expenditures, but most went to the Palestinian Commercial Services Company, according to Palestinian officials.</p>
        <p>Most of the major investments disclosed in the audited report, like the casino and holdings in luxury hotels and the local telecommunications monopolies, had been reported unofficially here. But there were a few unexpected oddities, like small joint investment funds with the government of Qatar and the Peres Peace Center, a Tel Aviv foundation started by Shimon Peres, the former Israeli  prime minister.</p>
        <p>The report also revealed that Mr. Rachid's company recently put $9 million into a small biotechnology company in London, Ontario, Bioniche Life Sciences, its only disclosed investment outside the Palestinian territories. The Palestinian Authority became the second largest investor in the closely held Canadian company, and Mr. Rachid, whose wife and children are Canadian citizens, was awarded a seat on the board of directors.</p>
        <p>''I think they decided to invest in the London area for personal reasons,'' a spokeswoman for the Ontario company said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachid said tonight that he has no personal financial interests in businesses in which his government company invested.</p>
        <p>''After 23 years working with Yasir Arafat, I carefully watch myself,'' said Mr. Rachid, who joined the Palestinian Liberation Organization while working as a journalist in Beirut. He followed Mr. Arafat to Tunisia and, in 1994, to Gaza, becoming one of his closest confidants. Though he has no formal position in the Palestinian hierarchy, Mr. Rachid is part of the 11-member negotiating team headed for Camp David next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachid and other Palestinian leaders characterize their budget reforms as an essential prelude to the independence they hope to secure in the peace talks. A sovereign Palestinian state will be able to seek loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and put up guarantees for commercial bond issues -- but only if its books are in order, they say.</p>
