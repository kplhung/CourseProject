        <p>The Democratic Party opened public hearings on its platform here today with a tightly scripted display of party unity, hearing from a parade of witnesses who endorsed Vice President Al Gore's positions on almost every major campaign issue, including gun control, the economy, health care, education and the environment.</p>

        <p>The Democratic Party opened public hearings on its platform here today with a tightly scripted display of party unity, hearing from a parade of witnesses who endorsed Vice President Al Gore's positions on almost every major campaign issue, including gun control, the economy, health care, education and the environment.</p>
        <p>The daylong hearing provided further evidence that Mr. Gore, who easily defeated former Senator Bill Bradley in the primaries, will not face the kind of bitter policy divisions that have bedeviled Democratic presidential nominees of the past.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials intend to release a draft of the platform on Friday. And they made it clear that they expected it to be a clear articulation of Mr. Gore's vision rather than the kind of ideological treatise he might feel compelled to run away from.</p>
        <p>''My sense is that much of this is straight out of what he has already had to say, what he has already proposed,'' Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, chairman of the platform drafting committee, said today.  ''And I think he can run on it and win,'' Mr. Hunt said.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are hoping that their unified front will give them the appearance of greater party strength than the Republicans, whose platform meetings continue to provide a forum for fierce debate over abortion.</p>
        <p>This year, the trade issue was widely expected to be the Democrats' platform equivalent of abortion. Many trade unions and environmentalists, major components of the Democratic base, have opposed the Clinton administration's position on global trade, arguing that it has hurt the environment and siphoned jobs away from American workers.</p>
        <p>But today, trade was rarely mentioned. Indeed, the one person expected to raise the issue, Alan Reuther, legislative director for the United Automobile Workers, did not show up. Democratic officials said Mr. Reuther had a scheduling conflict.</p>
        <p>One of the few discordant notes was sounded by Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group. Speaking on the trade issue, Ms. Isaacs said: ''Granting China permanent normal trade relations is a step in the wrong direction, we believe. As a nation, we must state clearly that profits over people is untenable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Isaacs added that ''liberals in the country are very uneasy'' with the nation's political drift. And she urged the people writing the Democratic platform not to blur the distinctions between the two major parties, a criticism often leveled at the Democrats by Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.</p>
        <p>Mary Leigh Blek, a registered Republican from Orange County, Calif., who helped organize the Million Mom March for gun control earlier this year, typified their tone. Ms. Blek, without explicitly endorsing Mr. Gore, complained that the leadership of the Republican Party had not heard the voices of mothers who want stronger gun laws.</p>
        <p>''But I think in November, they are going to hear it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said the committee was likely to face some policy debates behind closed doors tonight as they hammered out the final draft. For instance, labor officials are pushing for stronger language defending the rights of workers to form unions. They also want a clearer pledge of support for trade agreements that protect the environment and workers' rights.</p>
        <p>Some members of the committee are also expected to push for a more sweeping declaration of the party's support for ending discrimination against gays and lesbians and a more powerful condemnation of racially motivated violence.</p>
        <p>But those debates are expected play out on the fringes, not at the heart, of the 10,000- to 20,000-word document.</p>
        <p>''We're not looking for a fight here at all,'' said Gerry Shea, a top official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who is on the platform drafting committee.</p>
