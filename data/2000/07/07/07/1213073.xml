      <block class="full_text">
        <p>It is a statistic that troubles many educators in Connecticut, and encourages others: nearly 14 percent of public school students in the state were expelled or suspended from school at least once during the 1998-99 school year.</p>
        <p>Some administrators see the figure, disclosed in a June report by the state's Department of Education and first reported today by The Hartford Courant, as a sign of stricter discipline in Connecticut public schools, which produce some of the highest-achieving students in the nation.</p>
        <p>But the figure, which represents one of every seven public school students in the state, has also prompted Theodore S. Sergi, the state commissioner of education, to issue broad new directives to Connecticut's 166 school districts to improve the behavior of what he called an increasingly belligerent student body.</p>
        <p>''There's a real collective feeling among administrators that it's time to be more aggressive in addressing the behaviors of our youngsters in our schools,'' Mr. Sergi said today.</p>
        <p>''We have to be equally concerned with the personal development of kids as we are about academic achievement,'' he added. ''The challenge is, we are not providing enough teaching around personal responsibility in kindergarten and grades one, two, three and four.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut education officials cautioned against comparing the data, compiled for the first time this year, with statistics for public schools in other states or for the nation. But some experts said that no matter how the figure was viewed, 14 percent was an unusually large proportion.</p>
        <p>''It's a high number,'' said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, in Washington. ''It sounds like Connecticut needs to make its own judgment about whether suspending 14 percent of its students is a good idea or not.''</p>
        <p>Most violations committed by the state's 544,657 public school students, prekindergarten through 12th grade, were minor infractions like cutting classes, talking back to teachers or using foul language. But the report also found that students were removed from their classes 32,030 times during 1998-99 for violent offenses like fighting, making threats or bringing weapons to school.</p>
        <p>Over all, most of the bad behavior occurred among students in grades 7 through 12. Ninth and 10th graders were, statistically, the worst behaved, accounting for 44,564 violations, or 36 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>About 51 percent of the students suspended or expelled were white, and 45 percent were black or Hispanic students, who make up slightly more than 25 percent of the public student body, the report said.</p>
        <p>Federal laws required state officials to compile the disciplinary report. The results suggest that Connecticut schools suspended or expelled their students in the 1998-99 school year at a rate double that of  public schools nationally.</p>
        <p>In the 1997-98 school year, 3.2 million suspensions and 90,000 expulsions were given to 46 million public school students in the United States, said Chris Chapman of the National Center for Education Statistics, who quoted data compiled by the Office of Civil Rights, a unit of the federal Department of Education.</p>
        <p>The data revealed only the number of these punishments, not the number of students who received them. But even if the punishments were meted out at a rate of no more than one per student, the national rate would still be only 7 percent, half that measured in Connecticut last year.</p>
        <p>As in Connecticut, black public school students nationally were suspended and expelled at a rate disproportionately higher than their school populations.</p>
        <p>Not all Connecticut school officials believe that the state's suspension or expulsion rate is terrible news. In the Stratford School District, in Fairfield County, Superintendent Raymond O'Connell said he was encouraged by news accounts of the report, which he had not yet read.</p>
        <p>''Our expulsion rate is probably up there,'' he said. ''Actually, I'm a little bit encouraged by it. Our Saturday detention program seems to be having a positive effect on the kids.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, he said, Stratford schools have increased their security precautions, installing video cameras on school buses and equipping recess supervisors with two-way radios in case of trouble.</p>
        <p>''There's a heightened awareness that kids get a steady diet of violence, and some of that filters into the schools,'' he added. ''You've got to nip it in the bud or you're going to pay the price.''</p>
