        <p>The screenwriter Carl Gottlieb tells a story about Steven Spielberg, then a young director making ''Jaws,'' and a very small backyard swimming pool. In the film a man's head suddenly and shockingly appears in an underwater hulk. After the movie was shot, the editor, Verna Fields, was working on it in her garage when Mr. Spielberg became dissatisfied with the scene and decided to shoot it again in Ms. Fields's pool. He would pay for it himself if need be.</p>
        <p>The boat remains were retrieved from the prop department and sunk. The pool was lined with black plastic, and milk was dumped in the water to make it opaque. An underwater cameraman descended and kept shooting the rubber head. Eventually the studio agreed to pay the bill.</p>
        <p>Next week much old ''Jaws'' lore will resurface in a 25th-anniversary edition on tape (two cassettes) and DVD from Universal. In 1975, the movie was a sensation, the first of the big mass-audience action films that would take over the industry. In its first two months, it brought in $90 million at the box office, passing ''The Sting'' and ''The Exorcist'' and posing a threat to ''The Godfather'' as the biggest money-maker ever.</p>
        <p>Some critics were shocked at what they saw as the film's blatant attempt to exploit and manipulate. '' 'Jaws' is so shabbily constructed that audiences don't even pay attention during the quiet intervals,'' Stephen Farber wrote in The New York Times. ''They're just waiting to see if the director can top the last spectacular death or dismemberment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spielberg, as explained in a 75-minute making-of documentary on  tape and disc, was waiting for the shark. In those days the monsters were hydraulic, not digital. ''The shark didn't work very well,'' Mr. Gottlieb said in an interview. ''Storms trashed the mechanism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gottlieb got the writing credit, along with Peter Benchley, on whose novel the film was based. In an early memo to Mr. Spielberg, he recommended losing a proposed Mafia subplot and getting rid of the sexual tension between Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the wife of the police chief, Brody (Roy Scheider).</p>
        <p>At the end of the film the shark had to get in the boat with Brody and Quint (Robert Shaw), the hard-bitten captain. Until then it was a work in progress. ''I told Steven, 'If you don't have a shark, let's shoot stuff without one,' '' Mr. Gottlieb said. While the movie has plenty of gore in the water and yellow harpoon barrels tearing here and there along the surface, the beast rarely exposes more than a fin and some teeth.</p>
        <p>''Our model was 'The Thing,' a low-budget black-and-white thriller,'' Mr. Gottlieb said. ''The key element there was that you didn't see the monster, just the effects.'' Also known as ''The Thing From Another World,'' the film, made in 1951, is regarded as one of the best in its genre.</p>
        <p>Most critics now say the same about ''Jaws.'' And what's wrong with a little manipulation? ''It's what Hitchcock did better than anybody,'' Mr. Gottlieb said.</p>
