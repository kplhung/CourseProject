        <p>Yeshiva University Museum is inviting families to approach the year 2000 as they never have before: without interstate highways, the Internet or even indoor plumbing. If this sounds peculiar, it's probably because you have the wrong millennium in mind. In the Children's Gallery of the museum's new Chelsea home, the starting point is around 2000 B.C.</p>
        <p>''From Tent to Temple: Life in the Ancient Near East,'' an interactive exhibition developed by the Jewish Children's Learning Lab, recreates the world of the Hebrews and other peoples of 3,900 to 2,900 years ago.</p>

        <p>Yeshiva University Museum is inviting families to approach the year 2000 as they never have before: without interstate highways, the Internet or even indoor plumbing. If this sounds peculiar, it's probably because you have the wrong millennium in mind. In the Children's Gallery of the museum's new Chelsea home, the starting point is around 2000 B.C.</p>
        <p>''From Tent to Temple: Life in the Ancient Near East,'' an interactive exhibition developed by the Jewish Children's Learning Lab, recreates the world of the Hebrews and other peoples of 3,900 to 2,900 years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's really about clothing, food and shelter, and how they relate to the divine,'' said Rachelle Bradt, the museum's curator of education.</p>
        <p>In more than 30 displays, the exhibition challenges children to solve problems the way their Biblical ancestors did. They can build a miniature plow, grind grain with stones, dress a life-size puppet with period-style clothing, construct a hearth and raise a water bucket with a shaduf (a system of weights).</p>
        <p>They can even hunt game -- images of it, that is -- with a bow and arrow. (The arrows end in suction cups.) This is popular not only with small boys, but also with ''the adult men,'' Ms. Bradt said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>Along the way, children are encouraged to think about how religion gave greater meaning to the ancient people's everyday activities. After investigating the Sumerians and the Egyptians, they can follow in the footsteps of the Hebrews as they build their first temple. This activity promises fun as well as education: at one display, the figure of a ship suddenly rocks when building materials are placed upon it.</p>
        <p>The exhibition's final section poses ethical quandaries and asks children to solve them according to the Biblical ideal -- the one element that hasn't changed in all these thousands of years.</p>
        <p>''From Tent to Temple: Life in the Ancient Near East,'' through Jan. 14, 2001, at the Center for Jewish History, Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 294-8330. Hours: Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Free with admission: $6; the elderly and ages 5 to 12, $4; under 5 and members, free.</p>
        <p>Hot Feet</p>
        <p>Tomorrow parents should have no trouble persuading their children to take time out for a lesson in Latin. No need to worry about grammar: the subject matter here will run more to congas than to conjugations.</p>
        <p>The occasion is Kids Day of Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing festival, in which the program, a Family Iced Tea Dance, will echo the festival's Latin music theme. Maria Torres, who is appearing in ''Swing!'' on Broadway, will have everyone on their feet with salsa, mambo, merengue, cha-cha-cha, rumba and the tango. ''Kids learn very quickly and have a ball,'' said Rebecca Weller, the festival's producer.</p>
        <p>In addition to doing their own fancy footwork, families can watch a 15-minute performance of Latin social dance by the 6- to 16-year-old students of the Starlite Dance Studio in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>A D.J. will provide the music, and Lipton, the free iced tea. All ages are invited, said Ms. Weller, whose 6-month-old may well master the tango before toddling. As she put it, ''It's never too early to start dancing.''</p>
        <p>Family Iced Tea Dance, tomorrow from 4:30 to 6 p.m. on the Josie Robertson Plaza, Lincoln Center. Free. Information: (212) 875-5766.</p>
        <p>Machine Dreams</p>
        <p>Some recent products from the next generation of inventors: a car with helicopter blades, a mechanical glove that contains school supplies, a CD-ROM that makes wardrobe selections and, oh yes, a Duck-a-Phone. (It quacks instead of rings.)</p>
        <p>Although these designs have not yet made it to the assembly line, they are well past the drawing board, thanks to some enterprising children and the new Inventor Center at the Children's Museum of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday we had a clock that flies,'' said Megan Swiderski, the manager of the center. Filled with 10 computer workstations from Hewlett-Packard, the exhibition's sponsor, the center is a high-tech idea laboratory in which children use software developed by the museum to realize their wildest dreams.</p>
        <p>During an hourlong workshop limited to children 6 and older accompanied by adults, each child either draws an original invention or develops the default project included in the software: a bicycle that won't crash. After the young inventor's drawing is scanned into the computer, the child can then customize it (or the bicycle model) by dragging and clicking optional gadgets, like air bags, parachutes and propellers.</p>
        <p>''We tell them that Leonardo da Vinci's first inventions were drawn, and they're the inventors of the future,'' Ms. Swiderski said.</p>
        <p>After the fine-tuning, the next step is an on-screen interview that consists of completing sentences like, ''I got the idea for this invention by . . .'' A museum educator then takes the child's photograph and incorporates it into a mock patent form that includes the child's responses. Two copies are printed out: one to take home and the other to be posted on the Invention Wall as an inspiration.</p>
        <p>Each day the center will offer six workshops; registration is required. The museum will provide everything needed, except, of course, imagination.</p>
        <p>The Inventor Center, through Nov. 30 at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, the Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1234. Hours through Labor Day: Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free with admission: $6; the elderly, $3; under 1 and members, free.</p>
