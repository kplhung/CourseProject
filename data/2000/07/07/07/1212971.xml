        <p>Most theoretical physicists agree that time travel is impossible. If you could go back to the past, they reason, you could alter the present in ways that flout all the rules of the universe by killing your father, falling in love with your mother, stepping on a butterfly. For the same reasons, science fiction writers and Hollywood filmmakers have found the notion irresistible as a source of  terror (the ''Terminator'' movies, ''12 Monkeys'') or comfort (''Back to the Future,'' three times).</p>
        <p>''Disney's 'The Kid' '' -- this is the official title, presumably to avoid confusion by time-travelers with fond memories of the Charlie Chaplin silent with the same name -- presents temporal dislocation as something so innocuous it doesn't need to be explained. No mad scientists or malevolent robots, no bluff pseudoscience about alpha waves or the space-time continuum, just a red prop plane zooming around Los Angeles, rearranging the laws of probability for one Russ Duritz, a churlish egoist crisply played by Bruce Willis.</p>
        <p>For the second time in as many years, Mr. Willis stands by while a child swipes a movie out of his open palm, and for the second time he plays -- this time for only a few climactic moments -- a child's invisible friend. This time the child, played by Spencer Breslin, is Russ's tubby, cute-but-annoying almost-8-year-old self, who has been dispatched from 1968, by means of an arrangement involving the aforesaid plane and a chimerical diner, to teach the adult Russ some important lessons about life, love and growing up.</p>
        <p>Yes, it's that kind of movie. The adult Russ works as ''an image consultant'' for an assortment of morally repellent businessmen and politicians and one lovable African-American athlete (Chi McBride; cf. Cuba Gooding Jr. in ''Jerry Maguire,'' a movie whose basic narrative arc is shared by ''The Kid'').  ''Somebody call the waah-mbulance,'' is Russ's mocking refrain whenever one of his clients sheds a tear. A more shameless hour and a half of waahmbulance chasing you haven't seen since -- well, since ''Frequency,'' the year's other big time-warp macho hankiefest.</p>
        <p>''The Kid,'' directed by Jon Turtletaub, who also did ''Phenomenon,'' floats its pathos on tame, family-friendly comedy. In spirit, it's like a slightly less madcap rendering of one of those Disney live-action matinee staples of another era -- ''The Shaggy Dog,'' say, or ''Son of Flubber.'' But while those movies affectionately spoofed (and always upheld) a midcentury, father-knows-best view of family life, ''The Kid'' embraces turn-of-the-century self-help ideology in a crushingly sincere masculine bearhug. Russ's problem is that he's a hopeless narcissist. The solution? More narcissism! Just what every shallow, overprivileged 40-year-old bachelor needs: another self to love.</p>
        <p>Here is a cruel, obsessive, self-absorbed man, who, in learning the error of his ways, also learns that nothing is his fault. He was a fat, unhappy kid, tormented by bullies and scarred by a repressed family trauma, and all he has to do -- get in your time machine, Dr. Freud -- is return to the scene of the trauma and, how to say, process it. In the meantime he is nurtured and coddled by three women (not counting his therapist) who have nothing better to do than indulge his whims and wait around until he learns to be nice to them.</p>
        <p>The charming Emily Mortimer is the co-worker Russ is secretly in love with; Jean Smart is a television anchorwoman he is mean to on an airplane; and Lily Tomlin -- Lily Tomlin! -- is his patient, put-upon assistant. All of them see the kid in Russ and quickly catch on that his pint-size companion is really a mini-him, in spite of the fact that, in an astonishing casting oversight, the boy's eyes are blue and Mr. Willis's are light brown. (This is not the only instance of sloppiness: after their first meeting, Russ jumps into his Porsche and chases the boy through traffic-clogged streets. It's supposed to be 3 in the morning, which is apparently rush hour in Russ's sparsely populated stretch of the Hollywood Hills.)</p>
        <p>By rights ''The Kid'' should be dreadful. Surprisingly enough, it often soars to heights of not bad. The script is by Audrey Wells, who wrote ''The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' as well as ''Guinevere'' (which she also directed); she has a way of being smarter than the projects she works on. Scene by scene and line by line, ''The Kid'' has a pleasant, unforced air, aided by the professionalism of the actors. Ms. Smart gives another brief, glowing performance in a mediocre movie, and Mr. Willis earns his paycheck with some fine smirks, a couple of dandy tantrums and even a few discreet tears. Young Spencer Breslin acquits himself well, though it is hard to picture him -- eye color notwithstanding -- growing up into Bruce Willis. And when he delivers his judgment on the man he will become -- ''I grow up to be a loser'' -- you know that nobody watching the movie or involved in making it believes him for a second.</p>
        <p>''Disney's 'The Kid' '' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Its humor and language are as mild as can be, but it has a few scenes of intense emotion that younger viewers may find upsetting.</p>
