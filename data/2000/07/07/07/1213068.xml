        <p>Private prep schools often provide a fifth year of high school for students who performed poorly in their earlier years and need to strengthen themselves academically before moving on to college. The American Federation of Teachers has suggested that public high schools formally add a fifth year for struggling students. That is not a good idea at this point. Public high schools need to make far better use of the four years they already have.</p>
        <p>The idea of formalizing a fifth year was floated this week by the federation's president, Sandra Feldman, during a conference of the teachers' union in Philadelphia, where Ms. Feldman called for a ''transitional-year'' program, before ninth grade or in high school, in which teenagers who lack basic skills could be prepared for college's more challenging course work. The optional fifth year, she said, would serve ''kids who are just absolutely falling through the cracks because no one's paying attention to them.''</p>

        <p>Private prep schools often provide a fifth year of high school for students who performed poorly in their earlier years and need to strengthen themselves academically before moving on to college.

        <p>The idea of formalizing a fifth year was floated this week by the federation's president, Sandra Feldman, during a conference of the teachers' union in Philadelphia, where Ms. Feldman called for a ''transitional-year'' program, before ninth grade or in high school, in which teenagers who lack basic skills could be prepared for college's more challenging course work. The optional fifth year, she said, would serve ''kids who are just absolutely falling through the cracks because no one's paying attention to them.''</p>
        <p>These are noble sentiments. But an extra year for a few students would quickly be expanded to cover a greater number of students. These students would be passed unprepared from grade to grade, on the theory that there would be time for them to catch up academically somewhere down the line.</p>
        <p>The most important task now is to improve the four-year system. A forthcoming study of national achievement data by the Education Trust, a Washington foundation devoted to school reform, shows that the public high schools have declined dramatically over the last 10 years -- and now yield less academic growth among their students than in any other phase of the public school system. According to the foundation's director, Kati Haycock, the new data show smaller gains in high school than in the lower grades, a consequence of a less rigorous curriculum that includes fewer challenging reading assignments than a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Those who favor a five-year approach argue that many students already take that long to graduate. This is certainly true in New York City, where only about half of all students receive high school diplomas in four years. Encouraging those students to graduate, even if they need more time, is the right thing to do. But allowing high schools five years to graduate students as a matter of policy would weaken the system, ensuring that more and more students take longer to graduate.</p>
