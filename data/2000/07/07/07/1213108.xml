        <p>LONG ISLAND: E.P.A. CLEANUP MONEY  Long Island, where ground water pollution from the gasoline additive MTBE is among the worst in the nation, will get $1 million from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to help with the cleanup. The federal government ordered that MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, be added to gasoline to reduce air pollution, but it was later found to be a health threat when it leaked into water supplies from storage tanks or spilled from cars.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: DRUG DEALERS ARRESTED  Seventeen people were charged yesterday with being part of two related gangs that sold about $25 million worth of the drug Ecstasy in Brooklyn, Manhattan, the Hamptons and Arizona in the last year. Federal prosecutors said one gang leader had also plotted to kill Salvatore Gravano, the Mafia hit man and informer better known as Sammy the Bull, but later resolved the dispute. The reputed gang leader, Ilan Zarger, a 30-year-old Israeli native, helped distribute more than 700,000 Ecstasy pills in the last six months, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: POLICE REFORM ADVOCATES  Police misconduct has jeopardized ''the human rights and the very lives of our fellow New Yorkers,'' several clergy members charged in a statement yesterday. They announced the formation of a New York Religious Coalition Against Police Brutality, including the National Council of Churches, Union Seminary, synagogues and mosques. It will lobby for more aggressive minority recruiting and other reforms. Norman Siegel, above, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the coalition would extend beyond what he called the ''usual suspects,'' namely himself and the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: RAT LAW PROPOSED  Reports of rat infestations, most recently on Tuesday at the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side, led to renewed calls yesterday for a city law requiring builders to eliminate vermin when they build or repair foundations. ''There is no silver bullet to solve the city's rat problem,'' said Stephen J. Fiala, a City Council member and Staten Island Republican, who proposed the new rule as part of a Council bill in January.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: CENTRAL PARK RAPE  A 16-year-old girl was raped in Central Park near 110th Street on Tuesday night, the police said yesterday. The teenager was at a  picnic in the park when she was approached by a man and woman, both in their late 20's. The man brandished a box-cutter, the victim told the police. The police said the victim and the man knew each other, but details of their relationship were not disclosed. No arrests have been made, the police said.</p>

        <p>STATEN ISLAND: HOSPITAL WORKERS UNIONIZE  More than 900 workers at St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Staten Island will join 1199/SEIU, New York's Health and Human Services Union. The union announced yesterday that the workers voted, 531 to 207, Wednesday to join 1199, becoming one of the largest units to join the 200,000-member union in recent years.</p>

        <p>LONG ISLAND CITY: SCHOOLS GROW  The School Construction Authority said yesterday that 10,574 new seats in New York City public schools would be added before September. Five schools -- three in Queens and one each in Brooklyn and Staten Island -- will account for 4,037 seats, while 3,655 will be permanent additions to old schools. Temporary buildings account for the remaining  seats.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEWBORN ABANDONED  A newborn boy with a birth defect was found abandoned in an apartment building hallway in East Harlem yesterday morning, the authorities said. The infant was left in front of an apartment on the fifth floor of 60 East 135th Street, part of the Abraham Lincoln Houses public housing project, Detective Edward Reuss said. The boy was born with his intestines outside his body, said officials at Harlem Hospital, where he was successfully operated on yesterday. The boy was in critical but stable condition last night, hospital officials said. The police were searching for the mother last night.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: CHINESE BURGLARY RING  Three Chinese nationals have been charged with burglarizing the home of a Chinese restaurant owner, and investigators say the suspects may be part of a group that has been striking  other Chinese restaurateurs. The nationals, Li Fei Huang, 24, of Philadelphia; Pan Zhi Feng, 26, of Brooklyn; and Li Ping, 23, of Manhattan, are accused of stealing $24,000 in cash and jewelry in a June 16 robbery in the Town of Lancaster, a Buffalo suburb.</p>

        <p>OLD LYME: NATURALIST HONORED  An island is being renamed in honor of Roger Tory Peterson, the naturalist, artist and expert bird watcher who lived in the Connecticut River Valley for much of his life. Mr. Peterson's wife, Virginia, said the island, Great Island -- on the Connecticut coast where the river empties into the Long Island Sound -- meant so much to her husband that she buried his ashes there after he died in 1996 at 87. He is best known for his guides for bird watchers.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>FREEHOLD: PLEA IN TORTURE CASE  A second man involved in the torture of a learning-disabled person at a party faces up to 10 years in prison as a result. The man,  Daniel Vistad, 24, of Middletown, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and bias assault on Wednesday in a Jan. 30, 1999, attack on Eric Krochmaluk, 24. Eight people are charged in the incident. Mr. Krochmaluk was bound to a chair, and the police said Mr. Vistad and others burned him with cigarettes and forced him to drink urine. He was warned that if he told police about the incident, his parents' home would be burned.</p>
