        <p>John Hagelin is gaining support in his challenge to Patrick J Buchanan to be Reform Party's presidential nominee; Hagelin, age 46, is a quantum physicist with doctoral degree from Harvard University, a practitioner of transcendental meditation and head of physics department at Maharishi University of Management; photo (M)</p>

        <p>His own press secretary concedes that he has an unusual curriculum vitae for a presidential candidate. John Hagelin is a quantum physicist who preaches the benefits of transcendental meditation. He runs the physics department at an Iowa university named for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. As the presidential candidate of the Natural Law Party in 1996, he won exactly 0.12 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>But John Hagelin is also the man standing between Patrick J. Buchanan and $12.6 million in federal matching funds, and that has made him a suddenly attractive commodity to Reform Party members opposed to Mr. Buchanan's social conservatism.</p>
        <p>Only Mr. Hagelin and Mr. Buchanan are on the ballot in the Reform Party primary, which began this week with the mailing of about one million ballots to party supporters across the country. The winner will be announced at the party's convention in August, and the winner's campaign will receive the millions in matching funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan, who has spent months gathering ballot access signatures from some 500,000 prospective voters, all of whom are receiving ballots, would seem to have a lock on the nomination. But his candidacy has roiled an already fractured party that everyone from Donald J. Trump to Jesse Ventura has tried to lay claim to this election season. And with Ross Perot, the party's founder, now declining to challenge Mr. Buchanan for the nomination, Buchanan opponents have been desperately casting about for an alternative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin is it. Yesterday the leaders of the Independence Party, the Reform Party's New York incarnation, gathered at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan to express their support for him. Among those attending was the avowed Marxist Lenora Fulani, herself a former presidential candidate, who last year endorsed Mr. Buchanan, only to break with him last month. Ms. Fulani yesterday called Mr. Hagelin ''decent, principled, pro-populist,'' and Mr. Buchanan divisive.</p>
        <p>Such characterizations aside, the two men could not be more different. Where Mr. Buchanan is ebulliently brash, Mr. Hagelin is soft-spoken and prone to flowery phrases like ''grass-roots politics and the laws pertaining thereto.'' He emphasizes his pedigree, peppering his literature with the phrase ''Harvard-trained,'' while Mr. Buchanan has fashioned himself  anti-establishmentarian.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Buchanan has made opposition to free trade, immigration and abortion the staples of his campaign, Mr. Hagelin champions preventive medicine, criticizing what he calls a ''disease-care system''; advocates a moratorium on genetically engineered foods, and has detailed plans for increasing crop yield; and  proposes using ''coherence groups'' of meditators to reduce stress and crime in major cities.</p>
        <p>At the gathering yesterday, he talked of building a ''mainstream political alternative.'' Mr. Buchanan's entrance into the Reform Party, he said, has caused ''mass attrition,'' and there is a ''grass-roots brushfire waiting to happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin, 46, was born in Pittsburgh, graduated from Dartmouth College and earned master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard. He lives in rural Fairfield, Iowa, where he works at the Maharishi University of Management, which calls itself  an institution ''utilizing the managing intelligence of Nature for professional success and personal fulfillment.'' There he directs the physics department as well as the Institute of Science, Technology and Public Policy, which his campaign describes as a ''progressive policy think tank.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagelin yesterday challenged Mr. Buchanan to three debates. But Brian Doherty, Mr. Buchanan's spokesman, said again that he would not debate his challenger unless Mr. Hagelin promised not to run as the Natural Law nominee should he lose the Reform nomination. As to the assertion of Mr. Hagelin and others that Mr. Buchanan was hurting the Reform Party, Mr. Doherty said it was simply not true. ''The party was in shambles,'' Mr. Doherty said, ''and he's rebuilding it.''</p>
