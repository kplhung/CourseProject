        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani responded yesterday to a book that claims his relatives had ties to the Mafia by saying that his years of aggressively fighting organized crime should speak for themselves. Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, also implied that he was a victim of Italian-American stereotypes.</p>
        <p>''I think I'll stand on my record of having prosecuted and put in prison more members of the Mafia than probably any United States attorney in history,'' the mayor said at a news conference in Flushing, Queens. He added that he had been ''threatened with death by them at least three times, four times, seriously, going back to when I was an assistant U.S. attorney. And if that's not enough to remove the Mafia prejudice, then there probably could not be anything you could do to remove it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was responding to ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani'' by Wayne Barrett, an investigative reporter at The Village Voice. In the book, to be released next week, Mr. Barrett writes that Mr. Giuliani's father, Harold, spent a year and a half in Sing Sing prison for armed robbery, and provided documents this week to substantiate the findings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett, citing an unnamed family friend, also writes that Mr. Giuliani's father was for a time a bat-wielding enforcer of a loansharking and gambling operation run by his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who was Mr. Giuliani's uncle. In addition, Mr. Barrett cites F.B.I. documents to assert that Mr. Giuliani's first cousin, Lewis D'Avanzo, was a ''ruthless and widely feared mob associate in charge of a massive stolen car ring,'' who was killed by F.B.I. agents in Brooklyn in 1977.</p>
        <p>Nothing in the excerpts of the book released so far suggests that Mr. Giuliani himself had any connections to the Mafia or was ever sympathetic to it. Some readers might draw the conclusion that the reputed Mafia ties of Mr. Giuliani's relatives, whose lives are described as bleak, made the one-time prosecutor even more determined to fight organized crime. But Mr. Giuliani, who said he had not read the book and did not intend to, apparently sees it differently.</p>
        <p>Asked if the revelations constituted a targeting of Italians, Mr. Giuliani replied, ''People have to draw their own conclusions.''</p>
        <p>He also said, ''All you have to do is look at the last 20 years, and take a look at my career, and ask yourself the following question: Is there anybody that's done more to reduce the influence of, end the Mafia, than me?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said a front-page headline in The Daily News on Thursday, ''Rudy Book Bombshell: His Mob Kin,'' was disgusting and added that the newspaper ''should actually be embarrassed.''</p>
        <p>As the news conference continued, Mr. Giuliani cited more details of his record on organized crime. ''I put in prison the heads of the five families for 100 years each,'' Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the five mob families that made up the ''commission,'' a board of directors that once ruled the Mafia in the United States. He added, ''I myself went to Arizona and handled the case that put Joe Bonnano in jail for the first time in 30 years.'' News accounts generally support Mr. Giuliani's statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani refused to answer questions about Lewis D'Avanzo, the man whom Mr. Barrett says was killed by the F.B.I. He also refused queries about his uncle Leo D'Avanzo. But when he was asked about his relationship to both of them by a reporter who apparently thought that the D'Avanzos were brothers and still alive, Mr. Giuliani paused.</p>
        <p>Then he flatly replied, ''They're both dead.''</p>
        <p>''The two sons?'' the reporter asked.</p>
        <p>''There was only one son, and he's dead,'' the mayor said. ''A long time.''</p>
        <p>Last night on ''Ask the Mayor,'' his WCBS Radio call-in program with Rich Lamb, Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Barrett's book and another book to be in stores next week, ''Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City'' by Andrew Kirtzman, were ''motivating'' him to consider writing his own book.</p>
        <p>''I am seriously considering doing it,'' Mr. Giuliani said, adding that it would be ''my opportunity to explain what I did, why I did it.''</p>
