        <p>LET'S skip the gamut of canine cliches -- ''he's gone to the dogs'' keeps trotting to mind -- and cut to the reaction that Arthur J. Browne's wife had when Mr. Browne, until last Friday the senior managing editor of The Daily News, told her that he was thinking about surrendering his 27-year tenure to join PetPlace.com, an Internet start-up dedicated to pet health.</p>
        <p>''I think the dog has driven you crazy!'' howled Gretchen Browne, director of the Rockville Centre Public Library and Mr. Browne's spouse since 1973, the year he signed on as a Daily News copy boy for $119 a week plus tips (those were the days when copy boys fetched food and drink for reporters in addition to hot-footing copy from typewriter to typesetter; Mr. Browne recalls them fondly because they stoked a romance for the newsroom that cured his post-adolescent apathy).</p>
        <p>Regarding that perceived threat to his sanity, the dog is a 15-month-old yellow Labrador retriever, Grady, Mr. Browne's jogging companion (most mornings they do a five-mile swing through Hempstead Lakes State Park near their home in Rockville Centre), stress reducer, and yes, his unofficial consultant.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Browne, who often converses with Grady as they chug along, solicited the dog's take on the quantum career leap that presented itself in June, three months after he was -- again -- passed over for promotion to editor in chief, he's sure the dog said, ''Go for it, dude.''</p>
        <p>''That dog has changed my life,'' Mr. Browne, 49, admitted Wednesday afternoon as he cleaned out his corner office, retaining just a few framed front pages (''My Secret Life With Bill'' and ''Farewell Yankee Clipper'' were keepers). ''But he's not the reason I'm leaving.''</p>
        <p>Watching the newspaper install and discard top editors, none of them him, four times in the last four years, was the reason. Besides noticing that his head hit a glass ceiling once he became senior managing editor two years ago, Mr. Browne felt it was only a matter of time before he wore out his welcome with whatever hierarchy came next. And the wheel, as he says, keeps on turning at The News: ''I'm just like a piece of furniture that's always been there that's not there anymore.''</p>
        <p>Choice metaphor, Mr. Browne.</p>
        <p>''I'm fortunate to have lived through all the changes, but any rational person in my place would question if that was going to hold forever,'' said Mr. Browne, who survived nine regimes, made enemies when he kept the paper going in the 1990 strike, but had a reputation as a square-shooter with a clear sense of the paper's role with its readers.</p>
        <p>As for his role on the editorial staff, which was unprecedented in its longevity, Mr. Browne said, ''You serve at the pleasure of the editor and publisher, and at some point some person is likely to say, 'I don't want Arthur Browne around,' so better to go out standing.' ''</p>
        <p>LAST Friday, he informed Edward Kosner, the newest editor in chief, and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the publisher, of his resignation in a brief meeting with no negotiations or recriminations. He did not tell them that he was following Mr. Kosner's predecessor, Debby Krenek (her two-year stint as editor of The News ended acrimoniously) to PetPlace.com, where she is the chief creative officer and he (at last!) is editor in chief. He just said his decision was ''irrevocable,'' and money or catchy titles wouldn't change it.</p>
        <p>He did not even give the standard two weeks' notice. Not that he burned his bridge to The News, but he did burn rubber as he crossed it: resigned on Friday, took a four-day weekend in Cutchogue, cleared out of his office on Wednesday, announced his affiliation with PetPlace.com, and the site's affiliation with America Online, on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I could be jumping out of an airplane without a parachute for all I know,'' Mr. Browne said. ''It's time to do something radically different.''</p>
        <p>By the way, Mr. Browne wasn't always the enterprising, button-down guy in the corner office, the up-and-comer who worked days in the Queens bureau and earned a 1978 St. John's law degree by night to make himself a better investigative reporter, not a lawyer: radical was his middle name in his teens.</p>
        <p>Born in Brooklyn, he grew up in Freeport on Long Island, with two better-behaved siblings and patient parents. He attended a Jesuit high school but went haywire the summer he was 15: wrecked the family's new car, sank the family boat, and when he couldn't find any other capitalist trappings to trash, set fire to his bedroom. ''If my kids did that to me, I don't know what I'd do,'' mused Mr. Browne, who has four.</p>
        <p>He grew his hair to his shoulders, went to Woodstock and, terrified of the draft and Vietnam, allowed his parents to drop him off at Boston College, from which he emerged in 1972 with an English degree but no career clues. He was a lifeguard, bummed around Europe, and then, at 22, went to The Daily News, which had impressed him at 10 when he visited a relative who worked there, to ask for a copy boy position while he figured out a real career step elsewhere. The editor who hired him told him that he'd be better off, with his nice suit and college degree, going straight to Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''He told me copy boys never get promoted to reporter, that there was no career in it for me,'' said Mr. Browne, who proved him wrong within a year and kept it up for a quarter century. He's hoping for something similar at PetPlace.com.</p>
