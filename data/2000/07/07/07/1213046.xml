        <p>The former spokesman for Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who recommended the impeachment of President Clinton, has been charged with criminal contempt in an investigation of news leaks related to the Monica Lewinsky inquiry.</p>
        <p>Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of Federal District Court here ordered the former Starr aide, Charles G. Bakaly III, to stand trial starting  July 13, according to recently unsealed court documents that were reviewed by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>The documents do not specify precisely why Mr. Bakaly faces criminal charges, but they indicate that his legal problems stem from statements he made in an investigation of leaks from Mr. Starr's office in the independent counsel's impeachment inquiry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly requested a public trial in the case and Judge Johnson signed an order on June 29 granting his motion, the court documents said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly did not return telephone calls and there was no answer at the home of one of his lawyers. The home phone of a second lawyer was unavailable.</p>
        <p>At issue is a front-page article published in The New York Times on Jan. 31, 1999, in the president's impeachment trial before the Senate.</p>
        <p>The article reported that Mr. Starr had concluded, after intensive discussions with constitutional scholars in his office, that he had the constitutional authority to indict a sitting president.</p>
        <p>The article noted that Mr. Starr had not decided whether, or when, to seek such an indictment. It cited ''several associates of Mr. Starr'' as sources and quoted Mr. Bakaly as saying that no one in the office would discuss Mr. Starr's plans ''in any way, shape or form.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly denied at the time that he was a source of the article and has maintained his denials ever since. But after an internal investigation of unauthorized disclosures from Mr. Starr's office, Mr. Bakaly abruptly resigned from the independent counsel's office on March 11, 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starr said he accepted Mr. Bakaly's resignation ''with regret,'' but left no doubt that his aide's departure and the newspaper disclosures were linked.</p>
        <p>Editors at The Times have said they do not and will not discuss the sources for the article.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson oversaw the grand jury that Mr. Starr used to gather evidence about Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Judge Johnson repeatedly warned all parties in the case against discussing grand jury material with news organizations. She ruled in favor of Mr. Clinton's lawyers when they accused Mr. Starr and his associates of discussing privileged material with reporters from a number of news organizations and asked them to stop doing so.</p>
        <p>But in September 1999 a federal appeals court overruled Judge Johnson, saying there was nothing illegal in discussions by Mr. Starr or his aides with reporters about deliberations over whether to indict Mr. Clinton. The three-judge appeals court panel ruled unanimously that such discussions were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules and their publication did not violate any laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly apparently faces legal jeopardy not for any role he might have played in disclosing such information, but rather for statements he made to Justice Department officials who investigated the office of independent counsel for illegal disclosures of grand jury material in the wake of The Times article and other press accounts.</p>
        <p>The action against Mr. Bakaly makes him only the second figure in the bitter and deeply partisan White House sex and lies scandal to face federal criminal charges.</p>
        <p>Julie Hiatt Steele, a minor player in the Lewinsky case, was indicted on federal fraud charges but escaped conviction when a jury deadlocked.</p>
        <p>In May, the chief state prosecutor of Maryland dropped criminal wiretapping charges against Linda R. Tripp, the Pentagon employee who secretly recorded conversations with Ms. Lewinsky about her affair with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Stephen F. Montanarelli, said he had abandoned the case because a judge suppressed testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that Mr. Montanarelli said was crucial to obtaining a conviction.</p>
