        <p>In a mild surprise, Germany was awarded the 2006 World Cup over South Africa yesterday as international soccer officials apparently chose the certain success of the world's largest sporting event in a European country over concerns of stability and safety about post-apartheid South Africa.</p>

        <p>In a mild surprise, Germany was awarded the 2006 World Cup over South Africa yesterday as international soccer officials apparently chose the certain success of the world's largest sporting event in a European country over concerns of stability and safety about post-apartheid South Africa.</p>
        <p>Germany prevailed by one vote in a dramatic result that carried much political soccer intrigue in Zurich, the home of the sport's world governing body, known by its French initials as FIFA. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany said the victory showed that his country was ''open to the world and hospitable'' a half-century after Nazism and nearly three decades after the slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa called the defeat ''a tragic day for Africa.'' Securing the World Cup was being viewed as a way to help transform South Africa as it continues to reshape itself from its recent past of government-mandated racial separation by boosting national pride, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors and a billion television viewers, adding several billions of dollars and more than 100,000 jobs to the struggling economy and ameliorating the concerns of skittish international investors. While rugby and cricket are the national sports of white South Africans, soccer is the sport of choice for the overwhelming black majority.</p>
        <p>South Africa had been host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 1996 African Nations Cup soccer championships and believed it had the necessary stadiums, infrastructure and technology to stage the 2006 World Cup. Instead, for the second time in three years, it was denied a major international sporting event. In the fall of 1997, Cape Town lost to Athens in its bid to be host of the 2004 Summer Games as members of the International Olympic Committee voiced concerns after Nelson Mandela left office as president of South Africa.</p>
        <p>Alan I. Rothenberg, the past president of the United States Soccer Federation who headed the FIFA committee that inspected the countries bidding on the 2006 World Cup, said his group had ranked Germany just ahead of South Africa in terms of preparedness. Germany is an international soccer power, having won three World Cups and three European titles, and it has Europe's strongest economy. It also entered yesterday's voting with the firm backing of the eight Europeans who are one-third of the 24-member FIFA executive committee, whose main job is to award the World Cup. For the 2002 World Cup, South Korea and Japan will be the co-hosts.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Brazil had withdrawn its candidacy and thrown its support behind South Africa, reportedly in exchange for South Africa's support of its bid for the 2010 World Cup. Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, the president of FIFA, had also thrown his public support behind South Africa. England's chances disappeared with the thuggish acts of hooliganism committed by its fans at the recently completed European Championships held in Belgium and the Netherlands. Morocco was never given a serious chance of winning because the North African nation had a severe lack of necessary stadiums.</p>
        <p>''I would say the vote was a mild surprise, not a shock,'' Rothenberg, who organized the most successful World Cup ever held, in the United States in 1994, said by telephone from Zurich. ''We felt for some time that it would come down to Germany or South Africa and be very close.''</p>
        <p>Both countries were considered well qualified, Rothenberg said, but increasing violence in South Africa appeared to make some voters hesitant.</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, nothing could be surer than having Germany or any other major western European country hosting a World Cup,'' Rothenberg said. ''It's going to be enormously successful. South Africa came down to people assessing in their heart that while they may want it to go to South Africa, it is better to wait a while longer. This new country is only six years old. Obviously it has certain safety problems. We were satisfied after speaking with law enforcement and security people that people would be safe going there during the World Cup. We were satisfied; possibly other people weren't.''</p>
        <p>In the end, yesterday's voting was also affected by the ubiquitous and complicated political intrigue that attends the awarding of all major international sporting events. Three rounds of polling were necessary before Germany prevailed with a majority of votes from FIFA's executive committee. In the final round, Germany prevailed by 12-11, with an unexplained abstention from Charles Dempsey, a delegate from New Zealand.</p>
        <p>The South Africans claimed that Dempsey had reneged on a promise to vote for them after England had been eliminated. His abstention led to speculation that Blatter, FIFA's president, had orchestrated the German victory behind the scenes even though he publicly supported South Africa. Had Dempsey voted for South Africa, leaving the result even at 12-12, Blatter would have been called upon to break the tie.</p>
        <p>''I was a little bit sad that the executive committee had not the courage to innovate,'' Blatter said. ''We have to trust Africa and we have to take this decision. We have to take the risk, otherwise they will never have a chance.''</p>
        <p>''It's very strange, unfortunate,'' Rothenberg said of Dempsey's abstention. ''He claimed he was under enormous pressure. So is everyone on the committee. It's probably the single most important thing you do as a member of the FIFA executive committee, vote on the host of the World Cup. You make your vote and take the consequences. Some like it or hate it, but that's life. You do the right thing. I don't understand.''</p>
