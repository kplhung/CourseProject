        <p>John J. Oliver Sr., a former president and chief operating officer of the Afro-American newspaper group, died on June 30 at a nursing home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 86.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oliver, a native of Brazil, Ind., was the grandson of John H. Murphy Sr., who founded the Baltimore Afro-American in 1892. He graduated from DePauw University and joined the family business in 1935.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oliver spent 47 years with the newspaper group, which is based in Baltimore. The Afro-American peaked with the civil rights movement in the 1960's, when it published about a dozen editions circulating from South Carolina to New Jersey. At the time, the Afro-American spotlighted racial discrimination.</p>
        <p>The group now publishes weekly in Baltimore and Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oliver, who was widowed twice, is survived by a son, John J., the current publisher; a daughter, Marilyn O. Pickett of Silver Spring; and a grandson.</p>
