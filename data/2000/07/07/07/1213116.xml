        <p>Bose Pacia Modern  508 West 26th Street, Chelsea  Through July 20</p>
        <p>In the 1980's the American artist Peter Nagy ran an ahead-of-the-curve gallery called Nature Morte in Manhattan. Three years ago he reopened it in New Delhi, where he now lives, and this summer he has brought several of his artists -- Indian, American and European -- to New York in a visually buoyant, idea-rich group show.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Nagy notes in a brochure essay, the most ''Indian''-looking work tends to be by non-Indian artists, and that's the case in two installations by the American sculptor Jeffrey Schiff inspired by the great Shiva shrine of Chidambaram.</p>
        <p>For one piece, Mr. Schiff has molded a soap made with symbolic ingredients into the words of a religious chant: you release the chant's power as you wash. For the other, he has customized temple architecture for secular uses, fitting modern column bases with slots for toothbrushes, detergent bottles and deodorant sticks, in a wry take on ceremonial cleansing, Western style.</p>
        <p>The British-born painter Nicola Durvasala, who now lives in Hyderabad, has also reshaped Indian forms. In delicate watercolors, she reproduces fragments of traditional illustrations for the Kama Sutra. The calisthenic couplings of the original are reduced to disembodied abstractions, a process that might be expected to thwart voyeuristic attention but ends up sustaining it.</p>
        <p>Ritualized eroticism, with its hierarchies of dominance, is also the subject of a piece by Anita Dube, an artist based in New Delhi. Her installation titled ''Theater of Sade'' and made up of found objects wrapped in black velvet, appears to approach the theme from a Western perspective. But several of the objects, including a statue of the infant Krishna, are specifically Indian and the velvet covering gives the work a tantric cast: black is the skin color of the goddess Kali, a figure of ambiguous, often destructive power.</p>
        <p>The incremental format of Ms. Dube's piece is characteristic of the show as a whole. A New York artist, Sandra Hirshkowitz, turns dozens of embroidery hoops into flower-filled mandalas. Jayashree Chakravarty, from Calcutta, makes a sculptural floor piece from sheets of cardboard covered with notational painting and folded to look like books or maps. Lyndell Brown and Charles Green, from Australia, contribute two large photographs of their own bulletin-board-style collages in which Indian and Western images overlap.</p>
        <p>The influential artist Vivan Sundaram, based in New Delhi, brings the same cultural mix to an installation from his ''Great Indian Bazaar'' project, first seen at the second Johannesburg Biennale: a heap of some 800 individually framed color snapshots, taken by the artist, of second-hand domestic and foreign items on sale in an outdoor flea market in Delhi.</p>
        <p>Many of the objects -- eyeglasses, tableware, sandals, radios -- are seemingly battered beyond use; some are barely identifiable as to function. But in Mr. Sundaram's hands they taken on a new and complicated life, both as evidence of what consumerism looks like in a country where disposable income is still largely unknown, and as exotic commodities retooled for sale in the great and voracious bazaar known as the New York art world.</p>
