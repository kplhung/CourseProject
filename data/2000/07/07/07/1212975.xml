        <p>''Scary Movie'' belongs to a venerable tradition of pop-culture spoofing that includes Mad magazine's movie parodies, the song stylings of Weird Al Yankovich, ''Forbidden Broadway'' and the great ''Airplane'' movies of the late 70's and early 80's. But these are hard times for satirists, given the pervasiveness of knowing self-mockery in everything from television commercials to campaign speeches.</p>
        <p>Keenen Ivory Wayans has made a specialty of sending up the conventions of genre movies -- blaxploitation in ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'' (1989) and hip-hop ghetto melodrama in ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood'' (1996). But in ''Scary Movie'' -- which was going to be called something like ''Scream If You Still Know What I Did Last Halloween'' -- Mr. Wayans faces a new challenge. How do you make fun of something that's already a parody of itself?</p>

        <p>''Scary Movie'' belongs to a venerable tradition of pop-culture spoofing that includes Mad magazine's movie parodies, the song stylings of Weird Al Yankovich, ''Forbidden Broadway'' and the great ''Airplane'' movies of the late 70's and early 80's. But these are hard times for satirists, given the pervasiveness of knowing self-mockery in everything from television commercials to campaign speeches.</p>
        <p>Keenen Ivory Wayans has made a specialty of sending up the conventions of genre movies -- blaxploitation in ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka'' (1989) and hip-hop ghetto melodrama in ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood'' (1996). But in ''Scary Movie'' -- which was going to be called something like ''Scream If You Still Know What I Did Last Halloween'' -- Mr. Wayans faces a new challenge. How do you make fun of something that's already a parody of itself?</p>
        <p>Mr. Wayans, directing from a script by a half dozen people including his brothers Marlon and Shawn, who also star, doesn't so much lampoon the ''Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy. ''Scary Movie'' has the feel of a very long sketch on ''Mad TV'' or on one of the later episodes of ''In Living Color,'' after Damon  Wayans and Jim Carrey had moved on, taking with them the show's ingenuity and comic spark.</p>
        <p>Like most gag-driven farces, it's a hit or miss affair. If you're amused by jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment, it should be a big hit. If you're not, and you haven't seen the half-dozen or so blockbusters it alludes to (''The Blair Witch Project,'' ''The Matrix,'' ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''The Usual Suspects'' in addition to the ''Scream'' and ''What You Did Last Summer'' movies),  then by all means miss it.</p>
        <p>Like the three installments of ''Scream,'' ''Scary Movie'' assembles a crew of overage teenagers (''In the movie we'd be played by actors in their late 20's and early 30's,'' one of them notes) and sets a robed, masked maniac after them. Anna Faris takes the Neve Campbell/Jennifer Love Hewitt role; Lochlyn Munro plays the boyfriend driven mad by her chastity, and Dave Sheridan cruelly spoofs David Arquette in the role of Officer Doofy. The on-screen Wayans brothers, with time on their hands since WB canceled their sitcom, appear as Ray (Shawn), a quarterback with sexual-identity issues, and Shorty (Marlon), a gangly pothead who gives his life to save the movie from complete idiocy.</p>
        <p>But the plot, as you would expect, is a slapdash piece of scaffolding on which to hang bits of humor that are annoying less for their vulgarity than for their tiredness. Couch-bound pot smokers, prison sex, mannish female gym teachers, those ''Whassssup'' Budweiser commercials -- hasn't it all been done to death?</p>
        <p>O.K., there are some funny moments of the sort you may look back on with embarrassment. I'll admit to laughing at the gym teacher routine, and at an utterly tasteless moment involving a cheerleader's severed head being deposited in a Lost and Found bin, but no more. And a few other scenes convey a sense of squandered possibility: for example, a fake movie trailer for ''Amistad II'' and a scene of fried chicken eating and mayhem at a showing of ''Shakespeare in Love.'' (''Brad Pitt's ex-girlfriend is a freak!'')</p>
        <p>Perhaps Mr. Wayans has aimed at the wrong target. Why not poke fun at the movies that ask for it by taking themselves seriously? How about ''Saving Erin Brockovich From the Cider House Gladiator?''</p>
        <p>''Scary Movie'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It consists almost entirely of vulgar sexual references, gory violence, depictions of drug use and references to nasal, genital and lower-intestinal bodily functions.</p>
