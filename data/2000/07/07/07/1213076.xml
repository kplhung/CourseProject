        <p>COLUMBUS had an easier time finding the new world than the Yankees have had finding a fourth starter in their rotation. Cracking the Japanese code in World War II was child's play, the theory of relativity a snap.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Yankees, who get clubbed and knocked about with regularity but amazingly remain afloat, like a rubber duck in a bubble bath, sent the rookie Ed Yarnall to the mound in an attempt to find another starting pitcher.</p>
        <p>Yarnall was brought up from Columbus yesterday, after a good outing against Toledo, and was immediately named the starter against the Orioles. Yarnall had been scheduled to be in the starting rotation in spring training, but poor performances relegated him to the bushes.</p>
        <p>From all accounts, Yarnall is an upstanding left-handed citizen and, at age 24, may have a long and prosperous career in the major leagues. Maybe one day we will visit his plaque in Cooperstown. But he swiftly learned that Baltimore was not Toledo, on the map or at the plate.</p>
        <p>As one fan, seated behind the Orioles' dugout, noted with impressive resonance at one point in the Baltimore half of the second inning: ''What is this, batting practice?'' And then he shouted to the Yankee manager: ''C'mon, Joe, get this stiff outta there!''</p>
        <p>Soon after, with the Yankees trailing by 2-0, and the bases loaded and still no outs, Joe Torre took the fan's advice. In came Ben Ford. Out went Yarnall, to a chorus of boos. If you're going to play Broadway, you'd better have a thick skin. And better stuff.</p>
        <p>Earlier this season, Ford had also auditioned for a starter's spot but came up short. The first batter he faced yesterday, Mike Bordick, doubled. ''Bring back Irabu!'' another fan shouted. Hideki Irabu, the Japanese import who never lasted as a starting pitcher with the Yankees, is but a painful memory to Bronx fans.</p>
        <p>When the inning was over, the Yankees were behind, 7-0. At this point, a gloom settled over the Stadium.</p>
        <p>Just three weeks ago, the Yankees had brought up Jake Westbrook from Columbus and had started him immediately. He got bombed, too, lasting just two-thirds of an inning longer than Yarnall. He was soon back in Ohio.</p>
        <p>Now, David Cone has struggled mightily this season and was bumped from the starting rotation for the coming series against the Mets. It was hoped he would be the fourth or at least fifth Yankee starter, but the great competitor and long-time ace has a ballooned earned run average and hasn't won a game since the Coolidge administration. Is it his arm, his head, or simply senescence? No one knows, not yet, anyway.</p>
        <p>But, while the Yankees search, like coal miners with nail files, for that helpful hurler, their bats are alive like the sound of music.</p>
        <p>They came back with eight runs in the second inning, and five in the fourth, took a 13-7 lead and went on to a 13-9 victory. The bullpen, which has been dependable all year, saved the team again, along with the likes of Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams -- each of whom homered, which is nothing new -- and David Justice, who launched his first homer as a Yankee.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, though they are only five games over .500, remained neck and neck and neck with Toronto and Boston.</p>
        <p>It was fortunate for the Yankees that the Baltimore pitchers, particularly Sidney Ponson and Jason Johnson, seemed under the impression that they were also candidates for the Yankees' rotation, and were pounded.</p>
        <p>The Yankee search continues, and they have plucked, of all people, Dwight Gooden. In recent years, Gooden, 35, has seen many teams and better days.</p>
        <p>The former Met and Yankee and Indian and Astro and Devil Ray is back in the Yankee organization, and has pitched in relief for the Yankees' Tampa team in the Gulf Coast League. He was recalled yesterday to pitch tomorrow against the Mets.</p>
        <p>''He was recommended from down below,'' said Torre, after the game, meaning that the Yankee scouts tapped ol' Doc.</p>
        <p>Did he feel comfortable with a guy who hasn't pitched in the majors in two months? ''He's got experience,'' said Torre tactfully but not appearing wildly enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>Gooden has pitched in two games in rookie league ball and given up no runs in eight innings. But in the majors this year, he was 2-3 with Tampa Bay and had a fat 6.63 E.R.A, and with Houston he had a no decision in one appearance with a 9.00 E.R.A. Off of this, he seems perfectly suited for the Yankees' rotation.</p>
