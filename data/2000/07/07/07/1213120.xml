        <p>Corrections to July 3 article about challenge of maintaining a reliable flow of electricity</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Business Day on Monday about the challenge of maintaining a reliable flow of electricity to meet the needs of the computerized economy miscalculated the amount of time that a user would be without electricity if the power supply were 99.99999999 percent reliable. It would be 0.0032 of a second a year, not 32 seconds.</p>
        <p>The article also described FuelCell Energy incorrectly. The company, which changed its name last September, was founded in 1969 as the Energy Research Corporation. It is not a start-up company. A chart with the article provided an outdated list of the company's products; it spun off its battery business as Evercel Inc. last year.</p>
