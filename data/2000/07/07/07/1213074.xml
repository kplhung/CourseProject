        <p>New Jersey's Supreme Court agreed today to hear the state's appeal of an order to free a 62-year-old inmate convicted of murdering two police officers in Lodi, N.J., in August 1963.</p>
        <p>The decision means the convict, Thomas Trantino, will not be paroled on Sunday, as a three-judge appeals court ordered on June 9. The court scheduled a hearing on the state's appeal for Sept. 25. Customarily, its final rulings come several weeks after hearings.</p>

        <p>New Jersey's Supreme Court agreed today to hear the state's appeal of an order to free a 62-year-old inmate convicted of murdering two police officers in Lodi, N.J., in August 1963.</p>
        <p>The decision means the convict, Thomas Trantino, will not be paroled on Sunday, as a three-judge appeals court ordered on June 9. The court scheduled a hearing on the state's appeal for Sept. 25. Customarily, its final rulings come several weeks after hearings.</p>
        <p>Today's decision came in perhaps the most politically charged atmosphere yet in Mr. Trantino's 20-year campaign for parole. It dashed, at least for several more weeks, his best prospects for release.</p>
        <p>In 1964, Mr. Trantino received the death sentence for the murders of Sgt. Peter Voto, 40, and Officer Gary Tedesco, 22, in a bar in Lodi.</p>
        <p>In 1972, Mr. Trantino's sentence was converted to life in prison after New Jersey's death penalty was ruled unconstitutional. He became eligible for parole in 1980. Since then, all nine of his parole applications have been rejected.</p>
        <p>In the ruling last month, the appeals court overturned the state parole board's latest rejection, made last November. The court said the board's decision was not supported by ''substantial credible evidence.''</p>
        <p>In the Whitman administration's appeal to the State Supreme Court, Attorney General John J. Farmer argued that Mr. Trantino was easily agitated and prone to violence, and would present an unacceptable risk of committing another crime.</p>
