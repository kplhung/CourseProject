        <p>'Sculpture From East 100th Street, Part II'</p>
        <p>Alexander and Bonin</p>
        <p>132 10th Avenue, at 18th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through July 28</p>
        <p>A change of dramatis personae in Mr. Ahearn's cast of plaster characters, impressions taken from life of his neighborhood friends, has occurred since his move in 1995 from the South Bronx to the barrio of East 100th Street. Mostly wall sculptures in half-length or head-and-shoulder images, these painted likenesses range from whimsical self-portraits to frolicking teenagers at a New Year's Eve party.</p>
        <p>At the party ''Chris and Starr,'' a couple wearing New Year's hats are linked by Chris's arm as he toots on a toy trumpet. A boy and girl known only as ''KP'' are locked in a mouth-to-mouth embrace. ''Steve With Top Hat'' gives a mock salute as he flashes a toothy smile. And ''Terrell With Top Pop,'' clad in a bright orange T-shirt, swigs a soda from a bottle. Their life-size plaster presences are enhanced by Mr. Ahearn's skill at conveying in paint the subtle range of flesh tones.</p>

        <p>A change of dramatis personae in Mr. Ahearn's cast of plaster characters, impressions taken from life of his neighborhood friends, has occurred since his move in 1995 from the South Bronx to the barrio of East 100th Street. Mostly wall sculptures in half-length or head-and-shoulder images, these painted likenesses range from whimsical self-portraits to frolicking teenagers at a New Year's Eve party.</p>
        <p>At the party ''Chris and Starr,'' a couple wearing New Year's hats are linked by Chris's arm as he toots on a toy trumpet. A boy and girl known only as ''KP'' are locked in a mouth-to-mouth embrace. ''Steve With Top Hat'' gives a mock salute as he flashes a toothy smile. And ''Terrell With Top Pop,'' clad in a bright orange T-shirt, swigs a soda from a bottle. Their life-size plaster presences are enhanced by Mr. Ahearn's skill at conveying in paint the subtle range of flesh tones.</p>
        <p>His subjects also include two physically impaired men, a smiling Pablo who sits buckled in a wheelchair wearing a yellow T-shirt, a golf hat and a tattoo, and an intense-looking Miguel, a heavyset figure with shortened legs holding a small dog. Unlike the others, both are full-length figures designed in relation to the wall. Odder characters include ''Sharp,'' a groovy guru figure with long gray hair, multiple tattoos, a gold chain and a saintly expression.</p>
        <p>As for the sculptor himself, the only white man in the group, he portrays himself twice: as a hand-wringing clown with red nose and turned-down mouth, and in a more introspective mood with his face turned toward the wall. New in Mr. Ahearn's work are several unpainted plaster casts of many hands joined together, cast from subjects seated around a table. Suggesting the sculptural reliefs on medieval cathedrals, they add a spiritual dimension to this very human show.</p>
