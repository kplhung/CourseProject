        <p>As companies in practically every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.</p>
        <p>Known as B2B Web sites, the exchanges create a place for companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or grain, to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars in back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace online. But the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust experts say.</p>
        <p>Both regulators and executives agree that the stakes are enormous. B2B sites already account for about $150 billion in annual sales, significantly more than the better-known consumer sites like Amazon.com. And that number is expected to grow exponentially as businesses move more and more into buying and selling on the Web.</p>
        <p>''Antitrust has never had this kind of factual scenario to look at before,'' said Susan DeSanti, the director of policy planning for the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p>Last week, the commission took the unusual step of holding a two-day conference to which it invited executives, lawyers and consumer advocates to advise it on how to regulate B2B marketplaces. Already, the commission is examining Covisint, the site being planned by the nation's Big Three automakers, and last month the Department of Justice said it was investigating one that is being led by six large meatpacking companies.</p>
        <p>The Senate Commerce Committee also plans to hold a hearing this month on the airline industry's joint Web sites. And law firms are doing a brisk business in advising business-to-business exchanges on how to organize themselves so as to avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Government officials are beginning to take notice now because in recent months one group of major companies after another has announced plans to form exchanges.</p>
        <p>Indeed, legal experts say B2B exchanges are likely to present the next major forum -- after the Microsoft trial and the proposed WorldCom-Sprint and America Online-Time Warner mergers -- for the debate over how century-old antitrust laws should be applied to the new world of the Internet. As in the previous cases, lawyers say, the questions are not new: What is collusion and how can it be stopped? When are competitors allowed to cooperate with each other? Which rivals can they exclude from an alliance?</p>
        <p>The new twists are the speed with which companies are able to communicate with one another and the frequency with which longtime rivals, like DaimlerChrysler and General Motors and Ford, are setting up joint ventures. Legal experts say those ventures -- the B2B exchanges -- will give suppliers the opportunity to signal each other about price increases, for instance, or manufacturers a chance to conspire to pay artificially low prices for their supplies.</p>
        <p>''It's like the issue that came up with Microsoft,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. ''Is antitrust up to dealing with technology?''</p>
        <p>Corporate executives, for their part, say the exchanges will increase competition by giving companies access to the most updated, accurate information about prices. That in turn will lower businesses' costs, increasing profits for efficient companies and eventually bringing lower prices to consumers, they add.</p>
        <p>For now, regulators say they are trying to learn as much as they can about the B2B sites before issuing any far-reaching policies or bringing lawsuits against individual exchanges. ''We at the F.T.C. are very much in a learning phase,'' Sheila F. Anthony, a commissioner, told executives and lawyers at last week's conference.</p>
        <p>''The promise of huge efficiencies is certainly tantalizing,'' Ms. Anthony added. ''On the other hand, I can't help but wonder if there might be a serpent in the garden of efficiencies.''</p>
        <p>And Orson Swindle, another commissioner, said: ''We must get this right. Otherwise, we could do terrible harm.''</p>
        <p>The sites take any number of forms, from auctions that resemble eBay to online catalogs that allow buyers to sift through products. Some, like Covisint, are set up by the companies doing the buying. Others, like MetalSite, which is owned mainly by steel manufacturers, are run by sellers.</p>
        <p>In either case, though, regulators' worries fall into two general areas, Ms. DeSanti said. In shorthand, Professor Gavil added, the issues can be thought of as ''exclusion'' (who is allowed to participate in the exchanges, under what conditions) and ''collusion'' (what the participants might do with the information they gather).</p>
        <p>At the heart of the regulators' concerns is how the rapid exchange of information on the Web sites will affect the companies' behavior.</p>
        <p>In almost every sector of the economy, industry groups now spend weeks collecting data on prices and sales volumes. On the B2B exchanges, by contrast, companies will be able to see current information immediately. That could make it easier for them to coordinate the pricing of goods without ever speaking to each other about it -- a practice that legal scholars call conscious parallelism.</p>
        <p>Lacking detailed, current information, a company might decide to cut prices in a few markets and hope it can steal some market share before a rival catches on, said Jonathan B. Baker, a former F.T.C. official who now teaches at American University's law school. On a business-to-business Web site, however, information travels more quickly and could eliminate the price wars.</p>
        <p>The worry is more than than just hypothetical, antitrust experts say. In 1992, the Justice Department sued the nation's large airlines, accusing them of using their computer reservation systems to send up trial balloons on price changes. Smaller airlines also opposed the system, saying they lacked the money to buy computers that had suddenly become necessary to compete.</p>
        <p>As a result of the suit, the airlines agreed to stop publishing information about future changes in fares.</p>
        <p>Though the legal proceedings surrounding it ended years ago, the airline reservation system has become a frequent topic of discussion among executives, corporate lawyers and government officials today. The central questions it raised in the early 1990's -- of the ways that a network can cause collusion and exclusion -- are the same ones at the core of the new B2B debate, lawyers say.</p>
        <p>''It's a fair analogy,'' said Mark L. Walsh, the chief executive of VerticalNet, which owns 56 B2B marketplaces. Business-to-business exchanges offer ''a similar potential for abuse,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates also say that because so many of the exchanges are owned by competitors, the Web sites will allow rivals to make decisions jointly about production levels and inventories, becoming de facto cartels in the mold of OPEC. ''These are serious, structural issues,'' said Mark Cooper, the research director of the Consumer Federation of America.</p>
        <p>To address the concerns -- and avoid regulatory run-ins -- the companies setting up the exchanges are including antitrust lawyers at almost every stage of the planning, executives say. The lawyer for MetalSite has attended all of the site's board meetings, and MetalSite executives avoid giving specific data to its board members, who work for the steel companies that own the site, said David B. Bordo, the site's chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>''We probably show our board less information than most boards see,'' Mr. Bordo said. ''They only see aggregated data,''</p>
        <p>The exchanges hope to convince their customers that the Web sites are independent of the companies that founded them. Covisint, for example, is now negotiating with the F.T.C. over the terms of its formal separation from the car companies that created it, said A. Alan Turfe, the G.M. executive who is the exchange's interim co-chief executive.</p>
        <p>The customers, meanwhile, are concerned that proprietary information -- like how much aluminum they are buying and at what price -- will become available to rivals or clients.</p>
        <p>Francis P. Lopez, the chief executive of the Aztec Manufacturing Corporation, an auto industry supplier in Romulus, Mich., said B2B Web sites could cut costs and offered ''tremendous, tremendous advantages.''</p>
        <p>''But there are a lot of gray areas people are concerned about,'' Mr. Lopez added. ''We have to make sure we have the ability to protect privacy'' of companies' sensitive data.</p>
