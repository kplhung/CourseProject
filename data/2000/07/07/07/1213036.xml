        <p>Candidates for State Supreme Court here are usually so unknown that contestants with familiar names have often won because, political scientists say, voters thought they were actually voting for someone they knew.</p>
        <p>But this year, at least two candidates for Ohio Supreme Court -- and quite possibly all seven members of the panel -- may soon be wishing for those days of glorious obscurity. A boisterous, multimillion-dollar election battle for one seat on the court is making two candidates household names, while drawing uncomfortable attention to all seven members of the rancorously divided court.</p>
        <p>The race is making Ohio a case study in an aggressive new judicial politics that is reshaping courts and drawing unprecedented political spending to campaigns for state judgeships nationwide.</p>
        <p>''People around the country are watching the Ohio judicial race,'' said Seth S. Anderson, director of the Hunter Center for Judicial Selection at the American Judicature Society, a nonpartisan group. ''It typifies the intense involvement of interest groups in judicial races that has been growing for the last 15 years but that could reach its apex in Ohio this year.''</p>
        <p>Listeners to WSPD radio in Toledo have been hearing an unusual advertisement that seems to put the entire Ohio Supreme Court on trial. It was placed by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce to lure Ohio businesses to the state, chamber officials said.</p>
        <p>''The Ohio Supreme Court,'' the commercial says, ''has rejected reasonable legal reform,'' when it blocked efforts by the Ohio Legislature to limit liability suits against businesses.</p>
        <p>Some people here (Democrats) said the advertisement was an example of plotting by Chamber of Commerce types against their candidate, Justice Alice Robie Resnick, an incumbent abhorred by business groups because she wrote the decision blocking the liability measures.</p>
        <p>Other people (Republicans) said the advertisements were just a reminder of why Ohio jobs would be saved by their candidate, Terrence O'Donnell, a Cleveland appeals court judge who broadly hints he would have voted differently, saying he is against ''activist judges.''</p>
        <p>The Michigan Chamber of Commerce president, E. James Barrett, denied being in league with anyone. But whatever their true purpose, the advertisements were another reminder that judicial races are beginning to provoke the same partisanship as races for other offices.</p>
        <p>In a year when state Supreme Court campaigns across the country are transforming judges more fully into politicians, Ohio is leading the way, said Mark F. Kozlowski, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, which studies judicial independence.</p>
        <p>''If there is success in defeating Resnick in Ohio, that could very well become a model.'' Mr. Kozlowski said, ''Because there is an extremely focused, specific campaign against her, and if they defeat her that could become the textbook case.''</p>
        <p>Although the election is not until November, accusations have been flying here for months. With predictions that spending on the race could reach $12 million, the campaign is expected to be the most expensive judicial race in Ohio, and is likely to be one of the most expensive in the country.</p>
        <p>A race is also under way for another seat on the court, but the Republican incumbent, Deborah L. Cook, is favored over her challenger, a Democratic Municipal Court judge, Timothy S. Black.</p>
        <p>At stake in the Resnick-O'Donnell race is the ideological balance of the court, which has been split 4 to 3 on many economic issues, including so-called tort reform, which is how supporters describe the efforts to reduce the number of lawsuits.</p>
        <p>But, with many state courts around the country similarly divided, the Ohio election has also drawn the attention of national groups that view it as a test of strategies in battles over state courts.</p>
        <p>Each judicial campaign is limited by law to spending $550,000. The balance of the spending is expected to be by unions, lawyers, business groups and political parties, which are coming to see the courts as a political forum like any other. Ohio imposes no limits on spending by interest groups.</p>
        <p>In interviews, Judge O'Donnell and Justice Resnick expressed surprise at finding themselves the objects of so much attention. Judge O'Donnell virtually squirmed during an interview in his chambers and talked of earlier campaigns in which, he said, reputation and integrity had been the only issues.</p>
        <p>Justice Resnick seemed breathless from the intensity of the campaign. ''With these special interest groups,'' she said, ''people are beginning to think judges are politicians, that seats can be bought on courts.''</p>
        <p>Over the last year, Justice Resnick has inflamed Republican legislators and business groups by writing majority opinions in two highly publicized cases. The decisions struck down measures to limit suits by people claiming injury, and the state's system of financing public schools.</p>
        <p>For many here, the rulings highlighted an ideological standoff on the court, in which two Republicans have voted with the court's two Democrats on some issues.</p>
        <p>In her opinion in the school case last month, Justice Resnick seemed outraged by what she said were the inequities of financing public schools largely through property taxes. For the second time in three years, the court ruled that the school financing system controlled by the Republican governor and Legislature had deprived students in poorer districts of the education guaranteed them. In her opinion, Justice Resnick dwelled on descriptions of sewage leaks in Ohio schools.</p>
        <p>Republicans have declared that a ''Resnick tax'' will be necessary to pay for the public schools, and the state's Republican chairman, Robert T. Bennett, created an acronym for the race -- DARTH -- for Defeat Alice Resnick Tax Hike.</p>
        <p>The three Republicans in the minority on the court, including the court's chief justice, Thomas J. Moyer, have appeared to be crying for rescue.</p>
        <p>At a political meeting in April, Justice Moyer said Judge O'Donnell shared his philosophy of judicial restraint. Without mentioning Justice Resnick, according to The Toledo Blade, the chief justice added that ''when a Supreme Court justice decides he or she is smarter than the Legislature, what they are doing, in my view, is overruling the will of the people.''</p>
        <p>An ethics panel of Ohio judges is considering complaints filed against Justice Moyer by a critic of the court and a county Democratic Party chairman, who said he had violated rules intended to keep judges outside the political fray. Chief Justice Moyer has said he did not make a political endorsement, but acknowledged that he would not have spoken so glowingly about Judge O'Donnell if he had known reporters were in the room.</p>
        <p>Judge O'Donnell, 54, who often uses the word ''traditional'' to describe himself, was chosen by Republican leaders to oppose Justice Resnick. A review of more than 50 of his decisions shows that he has expressed a conservative view of the role of courts, but has seldom made sweeping comments about legal issues.</p>
        <p>In a lawsuit by the mother of a young man killed at a gay nightclub, for example, Judge O'Donnell tersely ruled that the club could not be held liable for failing to provide adequate security because its owners had no reason to expect a homicide. A Democratic judge, Leo M. Spellacy, dissented, saying the dead man's family had a right to a trial because owners had failed to provide security inside the club, even though it was in a high-crime neighborhood and there had been previous violence.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Judge O'Donnell declined to characterize his judicial philosophy and said he had also voted for plaintiffs in some cases. Judges, he said, ''should not be for or against anything.''</p>
        <p>Some of Judge O'Donnell's critics here have said his emphasis on opposing judicial activism is a coded way of saying he would vote to overturn some of the decisions written by Justice Resnick.</p>
        <p>''I am not talking in code,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Justice Resnick, who was first elected to the state's top court in 1988, is no firebrand, either, though she has consistently ruled that injured people have a right to have their claims heard in court. Now 60, she patiently climbed the ranks of Democratic judicial politics from the trial court after first winning election in Toledo in 1975. Earlier, as a prosecutor, she was a staunch death penalty proponent, with 10 death sentences on her resume.</p>
        <p>On the State Supreme Court, Justice Resnick has been neither particularly famous nor liberal. She has enthusiastically agreed with conservative criminal justice rulings. Once, in a case involving a protester who had burned an American flag, she voted against a decision that said the jury should have been told that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>Justice Resnick said she saw the current campaign as a battle of fundamental values. Her opponents, she said in an interview, ''want business to not have to worry about any negative decisions. To me, the most serious thing going on in this country is what corporate America is doing to working men and women.''</p>
        <p>The liability decision last summer made Justice Resnick a political target. For more than a decade, the Legislature had passed measures limiting injury claims and the court had struck them down as violations of the Ohio constitution's guarantees of the right to access to the courts.</p>
        <p>Then in 1996, the Republicans who had gained control of the Legislature passed many of those same laws again. In what legal experts said was a rare challenge to a court's authority, the legislators included provisions that simply said they ''respectfully disagree'' that the provisions violated the constitution.</p>
        <p>In a 4-to-3 opinion, Justice Resnick said the court had no choice but to strike down the laws again. To do otherwise, she wrote, would make the court ''a co-conspirator in the abdication of fundamental individual rights and liberties contained in our Constitution.''</p>
        <p>The decision certainly gained notice for Justice Resnick.</p>
        <p>Insurance, medical and other business groups began working against her. She ''defied the will of the people'' as expressed by the laws limiting injury claims, said Andrew E. Doehrel, the president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, who said his members were mobilized to defeat her.</p>
        <p>But the decision won Justice Resnick support, too. Plaintiffs' lawyers, consumer groups and unions are behind her. The Democratic Party will spend ''whatever it takes'' to defend her, said David J. Leland, the state chairman.</p>
        <p>In the quaint ways of the law, it was a procedural fluke that landed Justice Resnick in the position of writing two of the most visible court decisions here in years. After the justices vote on cases, the court selects which justice will write the opinions by lot, drawing numbered marbles out of a leather jar.</p>
        <p>So, just as she was facing a re-election bid, it happened that Justice Resnick's number was drawn both for the liability and school cases. The spokesman for the court here in Columbus, Jay Weubbold, said the number on the marble assigned to Justice Resnick is seven. It is not yet clear whether it is her lucky number.</p>
