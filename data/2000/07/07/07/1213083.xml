        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to an electronics plant today that was the scene of an event during her early days as a prospective Senate candidate last year. She talked today  about reviving the economy in upstate New York and chose this spot to begin a five-day tour throughout this region of the state.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Clinton began her upstate campaign swing, her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, was on the final legs of his trip. In a meeting with about 100 workers at a Lockheed Martin electronics plant and in speaking with reporters, she was quick to point out the differences in her campaign tactics from those of Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''He's got moderate talk on the trail and extreme rhetoric in his mail,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I just think it's hard to tell what he means and where he is from day to day. I'm not going to respond to his personal insults. I'm going to run a campaign on issues, not insults.''</p>
        <p>In particular, Mrs. Clinton reacted to a fund-raising letter sent to voters this week by Mr. Lazio's campaign in which he attacked Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton for having ''embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts.'' Mrs. Clinton, the letter states, ''covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how other people run their lives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has said he had not reviewed the fund-raising letter before it was sent. ''It's hard for me to get this straight,'' Mrs. Clinton said, speaking to reporters. ''Last week he was telling New Yorkers that he wasn't responsible for his voting record. And this week he's telling us that he's not responsible for his fund-raising letters. I think he ought to rename his bus. Instead of the Mainstream Express, he ought to call it the Double-Talk Express.''</p>
        <p>Speaking at a news briefing outside a senior housing apartment building in Syracuse today, Mr. Lazio said he still had not seen the letter and he continued to decline to specify what the president and Mrs. Clinton had done to embarrass the country.</p>
        <p>''I think you can make a big distinction between a solicitation letter for funds among your supporters and communicating with commercials,'' Mr. Lazio said, referring to television ads by Mrs. Clinton's campaign that he has characterized as attack ads.</p>
        <p>At the plant, where electronic controls are made, Mrs. Clinton met today with managers, took a tour and experienced simulated flying in a military aircraft. Meeting with employees, she answered questions on topics ranging from transportation in the Southern Tier region of the state to federal spending on research and development.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also attended a cookout with about 1,500 people in Endicott, N.Y., sponsored by the Democratic Party organizations in Broome, Tioga, Tompkins and Cortland Counties. Her trip throughout the region comes a year after she unofficially entered the race for the United States Senate when she visited the farm of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom she hopes to succeed.</p>
        <p>On this trip, however, Mrs. Clinton is a full-fledged candidate and her tour across the state's western half is focused on economic issues. She has produced a pamphlet that is being distributed to voters discussing various ideas, including tax credits for investments in new technology and making high-speed Internet access more widely available.</p>
