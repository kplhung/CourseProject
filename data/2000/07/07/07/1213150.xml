        <p>KANDEL-Frances Wender, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, second mother to several and cherished friend to many, passed away July 4 at the age of 67. Survived by her husband Al, daughters Wendy, Adrienne and Susan, grandchildren Anais, Felix, Max and Benjamin, sister Abigail Moss. Fran stands out for her ceaseless efforts to fix the world, on the larger scale through social activism and on the individual scale by teaching, mentoring, helping, inspiring, mothering, and loving people. Fran received last year's Distinguished Service Award for her volunteer work with the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, including 20 years of work on their jail project, and service as president and as Board member. WLALA also recognized her with a Pro Bono Service Award in 1993 and 1994 for work with Salvadoran refugees at El Rescate. She received the New (renewed) Volunteer of the Year award from the Harriett Buhai Center for Family Law in 1994 and was honored by the Legal Services Trust Fund Commission in 1996. Fran chaired the Prisoners Committee of the State Bar Legal Services Section, which she served for 20 years, and actively promoted justice as trustee, governor, or member of various other Bar committees and legal associations. Frances Wender Kandel was a people person-easy to talk to, animated, generous, loving, honest, indomitable, celebrating of diversity, and brilliant. She believed and proved that one person's life can make the world better.</p>
