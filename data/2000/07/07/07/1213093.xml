        <p>The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, traded against the dollar at its lowest exchange rate in 16 months, and analysts in Indonesia said it was unlikely to rebound soon. The rupiah settled in Jakarta at 9,290 to the dollar and in New York at 9,252.50. Analysts said politics, not the economy, was pushing down the currency, adding that they did not expect a significant upturn in the currency's value until after a session of Parliament next month that is expected to be volatile.</p>
