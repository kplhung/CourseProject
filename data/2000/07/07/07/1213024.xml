        <p>The Parliament approved legislation today to govern a $5 billion fund for Nazi-era slave workers and other Holocaust-era victims.</p>
        <p>The measure, passed on an overwhelming vote of 556 to 42, is intended to close, at least legally, the most brutal chapter in German history.</p>
        <p>The vote was not surprising because it essentially ratified an agreement reached after more than a year of grinding negotiations between representatives of German industry and the German and United States governments.</p>
        <p>The law sets the stage for payments to Holocaust survivors before the end of the year. It ends a half-century of denial of responsibility by German manufacturers, including the German subsidiaries of Ford and General Motors.</p>
        <p>Although the German government has paid more than $50 billion in compensation to various groups and Israel since World War II, the vast majority of former forced laborers received nothing at all.</p>
        <p>German manufacturers argued that the Nazis had simply required them to use the forced workers. Under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the government argued that it had already paid full compensation and would not pay more.</p>
        <p>The debate was changed by two factors. The first was a new wave of class-action suits in the United States, cases that could have potentially inflicted billions of dollars in liabilities on German companies. The second occurred when Gerhard Schroder succeeded Mr. Kohl in late 1998 and immediately began pushing for a resolution.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, German industry and the government will each pay $2.5 billion to a fund that will compensate as many as a million former forced laborers. Most of them are in central Europe and Russia, although many others are scattered around the world.</p>
        <p>The fund will also be used to compensate people who endured medical experiments at the hands of Nazi scientists and some of those whose property was confiscated.</p>
        <p>''We have responsibility, because we cannot disclaim the past, the good much less the bad,'' Finance Minister Hans Eichel told Parliament today.</p>
        <p>In a separate resolution, the Parliament formally apologized to Holocaust victims for ''taking away their rights, displacement, maltreatment and exploitation.''</p>
        <p>But despite the lofty goals of reconciliation, sourness permeated the debate.</p>
        <p>Former Finance Minister Otto Lambsdorff, who represented German industry in the negotiations with survivors' organizations, American lawyers and the United States government, lashed out at German companies that refused to give money to the new fund.</p>
        <p>After more than a year of fund-raising, German industry has pledged 3.1 billion marks, or $1.5 billion, from 3,000 companies, about $1 billion short of industry's obligations.</p>
        <p>''It is a public offense that the majority of companies have not yet joined up,'' Mr. Lambsdorff said today. ''All Germany companies, including those formed after the war, should contribute to the fund. Those not burdened by the past should think about reshaping the future.''</p>
        <p>The list of companies that have joined the fund includes most of the big corporate names, DaimlerChrysler, Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Volkswagen. It includes the G.M. German subsidiary, Adam Opel, as well as the German subsidiary of Ford.</p>
        <p>Many smaller companies have refused to pay. Many argue that they did not use forced labor and that they were bankrupt in the war.</p>
        <p>One lingering uncertainty is whether the agreement and law will shield German companies from future lawsuits that arise from the Holocaust. Legal immunity was the central demand by German corporations, who began negotiating only after having been confronted with a wave of class-action suits filed in the United States on behalf of former forced and slave workers around the world.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, the Clinton administration has devised a legal declaration that urges courts to dismiss any future Holocaust claims on the grounds that they are best dealt with through the new fund.</p>
        <p>As the fund is envisioned, former slave laborers, prisoners in concentration camps who worked without pay under nightmarish conditions, will be entitled to one-time payments of up to 15,000 marks, or less than $7,500. Former forced laborers, people who were dragooned into factories but might have received some payment, will receive up to 5,000 marks, or $2,500.</p>
        <p>American officials argue that the declaration, which will be submitted to any court where new suits might be filed, should provide German companies with the assurances that they demand.</p>
        <p>But German negotiators have been far less sure and continued to demand stronger wording long after both sides announced their basic agreement in December.</p>
