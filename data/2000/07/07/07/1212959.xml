        <p>''Shower'' was shown as part of this year's New Directors/New Films series. Following are excerpts from Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 30. The film opens today at the Lincoln Plaza, Broadway at 62nd Street, and the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>In an updated version of the parable of the prodigal son, the black sheep who returns to the bosom of his family after a long absence is less likely nowadays to be a sated sybarite than a rich, snobbish yuppie revisiting the humble background he fled in shame. Reconnecting with his roots, his shuttered heart opens, and he discovers that indeed there's no place like home.</p>
        <p>Zhang Yang's sweet but serious comedy, ''Shower,'' offers an uplifting, witty variation on this scenario. Set in contemporary Beijing, the movie tells the story of Da Ming (Pu Cun Xin), a sharply dressed young businessman who returns from the Shenzhen region of southern China to visit his aged father, Master Liu (Zhu Xu). For decades Master Liu, whose health is fragile, has run a bathhouse in a dilapidated district of Beijing. His right-hand man is his mentally retarded younger son, Er Ming (Jiang Wu), who takes a childlike delight in all the ritualized sloshing.</p>
        <p>The difference between the worldviews of Master Liu and his elder son is craftily suggested by an opening scene, in which He Bing puts himself through a coin-operated automated shower that resembles a human carwash. By contrast, at Master Liu's spacious establishment everything is done slowly and by hand. Much more than a steam bath, the place is a popular community center where the neighborhood men pass the afternoon hours in conversation and games of chess while drinking tea and being massaged. Two regular patrons stage heated contests between fighting crickets.</p>
        <p>Lolling about in one of Master Liu's steamy pools is a little like attending a languid group therapy session in which people confide their secrets and work out their anxieties. In one running subplot, a shy, chubby teenager preparing to appear in a local pageant loudly rehearses ''O Sole Mio,'' but he is comfortable singing only when he is under a spray of water. When Er Ming playfully turns off the shower, the precocious belter instantly buttons up.</p>
        <p>The movie's quirky characters are its best defense against sentimentality. Besides the operatically inclined teenager and the promoters of fighting crickets, they include a debt-ridden patron who is chased into a pool by shady creditors and a henpecked husband for whom the bathhouse is the only refuge from his screaming harridan of a wife. The ever-patient Master Liu ends up playing marriage counselor and sex therapist for this frustrated couple.</p>
        <p>As Da Ming's visit lengthens, he begins to absorb his father's wisdom by a kind of osmosis. He also begins to take responsibility for the younger brother, whose existence he had kept secret from his wife. The father-son strife is powerfully conveyed in calm, sorrowful performances that establish the movie's bittersweet mood.</p>
        <p>Taking a daring imaginative leap, ''Shower'' also reaches beyond the present to meditate on water as a precious natural resource. Interwoven with the story of Da Ming's return are visionary scenes of earlier generations of the same family, struggling against drought in northern China's arid climes. These scenes, staged as quasi-mythical vignettes, deepen the movie's ambivalent attitude toward progress and the drastic effects it can have on a settled community.</p>
