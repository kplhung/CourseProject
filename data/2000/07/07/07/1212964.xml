        <p>''For so long 'Longitude' was my weird little story that no one was going to read,'' said Dava Sobel, in a press release promoting the new television version of her book. ''For me there is a sense of disbelief about it all.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Sobel's ''weird little story'' about the scientific quest to measure longitude has become an unlikely cottage industry: her 184-page book, bearing the imprint of a small publisher (Walker &amp; Company), became an international best seller after it appeared in 1995. It has been translated into more than 20 languages. Two years ago, PBS produced a documentary adaptation called ''Lost at Sea: The Search for Longitude.''</p>
        <p>This Sunday at 8 p.m. Ms. Sobel, a former science reporter for The New York Times, completes her tour in Wonderland when A&amp;E presents a four-hour dramatization of ''Longitude,'' starring very serious actors: Jeremy Irons and Michael Gambon. The film surprises, much as the book did, by taking what might seem a worthy but dull subject and making it sparkle.</p>
        <p>Much credit goes to the director and writer, Charles Sturridge, who managed to remain faithful to the story's spirit while reinventing it for another medium. He hasn't committed cinematic cosmetic surgery, falsifying for mere prettification. Rather, he has found a way to translate Ms. Sobel's lapidarian prose and complex intelligence into more easily recognizable drama, without oversimplifying.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Sobel, the director wraps the narrative around the story of John Harrison, the 18th-century carpenter, clockmaker and musician who spent most of his life -- and much of his son's -- trying to solve the problem of longitude. Shortly into the movie, the filmmakers borrow the book's colorful and tragic example of why a solution was vital. There is a shipwreck, caused by a navigational miscalculation. The camera scans broken bodies splayed on the rocky shore, giving a visual jolt to the flesh-and-blood aspect of this scientific quest.</p>
        <p>While sailors before Harrison's time theoretically understood what longitude was (the distance traveled east and west from a fixed point), no one could accurately measure it because nature offered no obvious place for the prime meridien, the zero-degree longitude line. This was different from latitude, the north-south measurement, which had the equator as its zero point. Thus latitude could be plotted by calculating the length of the day or the height of the sun or observing guide stars. ''Child's play,'' wrote Ms. Sobel.</p>
        <p>Don't worry. You can enjoy the film version of ''Longitude'' even if you are an adult whose idea of child's play doesn't include calculating latitude -- or even fully comprehending it -- much less longitude. You just need to understand, even vaguely, Harrison's breakthrough: he understood that measuring time accurately was the key, while leading scientists of the day were certain that astronomy held the answer.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers reduce Ms. Sobel's thorough explanation to a line: ''To tell one's longitude, you need to know the time aboard ship and time at home port.'' In other words, you need a timepiece that works at sea. It's not enough for a science exam, but plenty to move the narrative along.</p>
        <p>Although the movie, even more than the book, concentrates on the quest itself, it delivers an admirable amount of information about 18th-century science and politics, about the intricacies of early watchmaking and even about the effect of centrifugal force on a clock's accuracy. Heady stuff for a Sunday evening at home, yet in this context, strangely moving.</p>
        <p>The filmmakers have also amplified the book's political intrigues, underscored the relationship between Harrison and his son William (played by Ian Hart) and added vivid scenes of floggings, presumably to keep viewers alert and excited.</p>
        <p>To make the story more accessible, the writer-director Mr. Sturridge gave one of Ms. Sobel's minor characters a starring role and then chose a fine actor to fill it. Jeremy Irons plays Rupert Gould, the World War I Royal Air Force veteran who rescued John Harrison's clocks and history from oblivion. Gould's preoccupation, in turn, helped him recover from a wartime nervous breakdown. With his soulful voice and haunted intelligence, Mr. Irons beautifully conveys the redemptive power of certain compulsions without overlooking what can be ruinous in them.</p>
        <p>His exquisite neurosis makes a striking counterpoint to Michael Gambon's earthy and barely combed Harrison, who always looks as if something is unbuttoned somewhere. Gambon gives a vibrant portrayal of a self-taught man for whom knowledge and intuition are the same thing. He also doesn't separate the theoretical from the practical. He wants to win the Longitude Prize. (There actually was one, the equivalent of $5 million today, because the British government was so desperate to stop its ships from crashing into rocks.) But the money seems to be an excuse for him to continue with his obsession.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Sobel's book, Harrison was at center stage and Gould occupied slightly more than three pages, near the end. But Mr. Sturridge has the two men share the spotlight. Gould is on-screen almost from the beginning, acting as a narrator, and Harrison's legatee and alter ego, even though they lived two centuries apart.</p>
        <p>At first, the constant shifts in time are confusing, as the screen fills with period costumes and story lines from two different epochs. And sometimes Mr. Sturridge seems to stretch the parallels between the two lives (though, plausibly, the emotionally unstable Gould might have become so absorbed in Harrison that he began to see linkages everywhere).</p>
        <p>But in the main Mr. Sturridge deftly uses Gould to shine light on Harrison's quixotic determination and to translate his accomplishments for nonscientists. In fact, Gould did just this kind of thing for the BBC, on radio programs aimed at children. Mr. Sturridge uses one of these BBC broadcasts to give Gould the opportunity to underscore the movie's central theme.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of explainer that, depending on language and delivery, can either stop a picture cold or inspire a rush of emotion, as complicated matters become clear. This speech works. In the writing, Mr. Sturridge obtained elegant simplicity, and Mr. Irons invests the words with enormous heart and meaning.</p>
        <p>Speaking as Gould, in a gentle voice, he tells the children listening to close their eyes and think a thought no one has ever thought before, without paying any attention to anyone else around them. ''Most of us with our eyes closed just see the dark,'' he says. ''But the artist or the scientist can sometimes see something new, something never thought of before. It's these ideas that can change our lives.''</p>
        <p>Those intersecting lines on the globe will never look the same again.</p>
