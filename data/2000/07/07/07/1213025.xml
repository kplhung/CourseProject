        <p>South Africa is nothing if not soccer-mad, so the past few weeks have been crazed as the country collectively counted down the seconds to today's vote on who will host the World Cup in 2006.</p>
        <p>The designation seemed to be South Africa's to lose, and to listen to the radio, watch television or read the newspapers, it appeared that the only question left was exactly when today's celebration would kick off.</p>
        <p>So when the announcement came this afternoon that there would be no World Cup here, the disappointment bordered on disbelief, as stunned fans wondered how their nation had ended up empty-handed.</p>
        <p>Africa has been host to the World Cup finals, and with its political stability, sound infrastructure and soccer-loving people, South Africa was the best hope for bringing the spectacular tournament to a continent that has given more than its share of stars to international soccer, but has never been judged capable of staging the sport's biggest showcase.</p>
        <p>Eager to elevate the country's international profile after years of isolation and intrigued by the cup's potential to boost the country's struggling economy, South Africa mounted a furious campaign to win support from soccer's international governing body, known by its French acronym, FIFA.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the effort fell short. Germany beat South Africa by a single vote, 12-11, dashing the hopes, not only of a nation, but of a crisis-ridden continent desperate for something to cheer about.</p>
        <p>''It is a tragic day for Africa,'' President Thabo Mbeki said this afternoon in a national address in which he congratulated Germany and praised the South Africans who had spearheaded the country's bid for the tournament.</p>
        <p>It was not the speech he had hoped to make. Knowing how much the monthlong tournament would mean to South Africa, the country had gone to great lengths in its quest.</p>
        <p>Only a few years ago, Cape Town, the country's most cosmopolitan city, lost its bid to play host to the 2004 Summer Olympics, and South Africa was determined to make this effort a success, even dispatching the former president Nelson Mandela to Zurich for some last-minute lobbying of FIFA board members.</p>
        <p>This morning, the national broadcaster began continuous live coverage hours before the announcement, its newscasters decked out in the green and white jerseys of the national soccer team.</p>
        <p>In Soweto, as the clock ticked toward the time of the announcement, a double-decker bus packed with young revelers plied the streets, blaring music and urging the people on the streets to begin the celebration.</p>
        <p>''Give It to Us,'' the front page of the country's largest daily newspaper, The Sowetan, read this morning.</p>
        <p>But in the few seconds that it took FIFA's president, Sepp Blatter, to say ''Deutschland,'' it was over, and before long, the news was on the street.</p>
        <p>''No,'' read the front-page headline of the late afternoon edition of The Star of Johannesburg.</p>
