        <p>DESPITE a reputation for antisocial behavior (the episode of the amputated earlobe looms large), Vincent van Gogh was a people person.

        <p>DESPITE a reputation for antisocial behavior (the episode of the amputated earlobe looms large), Vincent van Gogh was a people person. He was an avid talker and letter writer, fluent in four languages. Early in his short life he held a series of face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer, a schoolteacher and an evangelical preacher.</p>
        <p>Later, as an artist in Paris, he met practically everyone in the avant-garde, and had visions of establishing an artists' colony in Provence; ''the school of the south,'' he called it. Only toward the end, when mental illness closed in, did he become isolated, and even then he bonded with his doctor, Paul Gachet, who, the artist noted solicitously, was even more of a nervous wreck than he was.</p>
        <p>Van Gogh is surrounded by people, and very much part of the crowd, in ''Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' a show devoted to his portraits, at the Museum of Fine Arts here. Among the 80 entries are paintings and drawings of friends and neighbors, lovers and strangers, and repeatedly, magnetically, of the artist himself.</p>
        <p>No career is better known than his, and textbook icons abound here, along with less familiar fare, including a series of seldom-traveled early drawings from the Netherlands. There are also notable omissions, of paintings too well known not to be missed, which may be why the show feels somewhat patchy and unresolved. Put the blame on supply and demand. With a spate of van Gogh exhibitions poised to hit the boards soon, the international loan situation must be tight.</p>
        <p>But whatever one's gripes, van Gogh is van Gogh; there is no one like him. He fills whatever room he's in. At his best and worst -- both are represented here -- he is transfixing. And in portraiture, a genre that he was particularly attracted to, he is unsurpassed.</p>
        <p>He had complex views about what it meant, though. He disparaged photographic accuracy. But he also kept himself a step removed from unbridled psychological scrutiny. Predisposed to view the world through a moralist's eye, he often treated the people he painted, including himself, as types, actors in an emblematic drama called life.</p>
        <p>For him that drama seems to have begun smoothly enough. The child of a middle-class Dutch Reformed minister, he was an appealing youth: a carrot-top with shapely lips, intense small eyes and an alert, bookish temperament. At 16 he landed a position in an art gallery in the Hague specializing in high-quality reproductions. He did well there and was transferred to the company's London branch.</p>
        <p>In London something went wrong. He fell in love, was rebuffed and grew morose. He started reading the Bible and became obsessed with John Bunyan's 17th-century inspirational allegory ''The Pilgrim's Progress.'' This book, rooted in nonconformist working-class theology, helped persuade him that his future lay in missionary work among the poor.</p>
        <p>He moved to a down-and-out coal-mining village in Belgium, where he taught the gospel, nursed the sick and drew portraits of the miners. After a run-in with the local church, he decided to channel his energies into art, following the example of the French painter Jean-Francois Millet (1814-75), who had made peasant life his subject.</p>
        <p>The Boston exhibition -- organized by George T. M. Shackelford of the Museum of Fine Arts, George S. Keyes of the Detroit Institute of Arts and Joseph J. Rishel of the Philadelphia Museum of Art -- begins at this point, around 1881, when van Gogh, in his late 20's, had returned to the Hague to begin his new career.</p>
        <p>He had been looking at all kinds of art for years, from Dutch old master paintings to English popular engravings. And he now set out on a crash course in self-education as a draftsman by copying pictures from student manuals and drawing the figure from life.</p>
        <p>With no money for professional models, he asked elderly pensioners in the city to sit for him. His drawings of them fill the first room of the show, and they're strange, at once bland and overly expressive, closer to caricatures than to portraits. That makes sense given van Gogh's ambition at the time to find work as a magazine illustrator specializing in social realism.</p>
        <p>The didactic impulse also marks his portraits of Sien Hoornick, a seamstress and former prostitute with whom he lived. She never looks the same twice. In one drawing she's a proletarian heroine in a prim white cap; in another, Melancholy personifed in a Morticia Addams dress. His sketches of her young daughter -- a feral, tousled-haired imp -- are far more direct and alive.</p>
        <p>This phase culminated in the 1885 painting ''The Potato Eaters,'' which is not in the show. Van Gogh feared that the picture, with its lumpish, simian figures, would be taken as a cartoon version of peasant life. And when it met with general antipathy, he knew he had to change course.</p>
        <p>So he went to Paris, where a new kind of art was being made. He stayed for two years, met many painters -- Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Seurat, Pissarro -- and learned from all of them. He also began the series of self-portraits that form the emotional core of his output.</p>
        <p>The seven in the show are worth the price of admission: they're like a dramatic monologue with quick-change roles and hairpin shifts in tone and mood. In three pictures from 1887 he is successively a shy peasant in a straw hat, an urban swell in a nubby tweed suit, and a grave, apparitional being with creme-de-menthe eyes who seems to be dissolving in clouds of jewel-like pointillist paint. Finally self-exoticizing reaches an audacious extreme in a slightly later painting in which van Gogh presents himself as a tonsured Buddhist monk.</p>
        <p>This self-portrait dates from 1888, when, feeling badly strung out, he left Paris for Arles in the south of France. And there he experienced his own private golden age. He was joined by Gauguin. His art opened up. The richest concentration of portraits date from this year.</p>
        <p>Among the best were those of a single family, the Roulins: Joseph, a local postman; his wife, Augustine; and their three children. He painted each several times, and 17 likenesses have been brought together for a reunion here.</p>
        <p>Van Gogh loved these people, and he gave them starring roles in his gallery of moral portraits. He compared Joseph, with his luxuriant beard and tippler's cheeks, to Socrates and depicted him as an exemplary upright man of the people, sitting face forward, at attention, as if about to speak.</p>
        <p>Augustine is assigned the archetypal maternal role: she's a placid, silent monument. Here again children escape typecasting: Armand, 16, just looks like a moodily teen agerish Mr. Cool; Camille, 10, is a scamp in a mushroom-shaped beret; the infant Marcelle, in one of the artist's wittiest portraits, is a squalling, colicky little monstrosity, truly fit to be tied.</p>
        <p>The stay at Arles ended in disaster: mental collapse, self-mutilation, a ruptured friendship with Gauguin. Van Gogh was whisked off to an asylum in nearby St. Remy, and turned out some awesome paintings there. But the path was downhill, and that's how the show feels. From this point on it's art as psychodrama.</p>
        <p>Further breakdowns brought him to Dr. Gachet in Auvers, near Paris. Van Gogh seemed to perk up a bit there; he painted ''Starry Night.'' But the portraits -- apart from one of a sweet, sleepy-eyed gardener and those of Gachet himself, represented only by a couple of etchings in Boston -- are pathetic: maladroit depictions of robotic adults and Munchkin-like children. The denouement came soon. Alone in a field, van Gogh shot himself and died two days later.</p>
        <p>His reputation not only survived him but also grew, tremendously. The exhibition catalog demonstrates his influence on figurative painters from Matisse to Chuck Close. And the current vogue for portraiture owes everything to the artist who gave the genre its modern form.</p>
        <p>The very look of his paintings -- with their cable-knit textures, Rajput colors and surreal versions of real things -- defines modern art for many viewers. But van Gogh is modern as much for what he was as for what he did. His art and his life are inseparable.</p>
        <p>He gave us our first complete visual record of an ego dying in public; we watch it over and over, like a documentary video of a disaster. He's our first celebrity martyr, the patron saint of our cult of disability. He's that most contemporary of tragic heroes, the blameless victim of the self. We line up for exhibitions of his work to look at great art, which even flawed shows deliver, but also just to spend some time in his charismatically star-crossed company.</p>
        <p>''Van Gogh: Face to Face'' is at the Museum of Fine Arts, 465 Huntington Avenue, Boston, (617) 267-9300, through Sept. 24. Admission is by ticket only for a reserved date; information: (617) 542-4632 or at www.mfa.org. The show travels to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Oct. 22 to Jan. 14.</p>
