        <p>As David Cone talked, he sounded weary, the weight of his confounding season lodged in his chest.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have decided to skip over him in the rotation, pulling him from his scheduled start against the Mets on Sunday night and inserting Andy Pettitte on three days' rest. Cone, the 37-year-old former Cy Young award winner, sighed in resignation at the slight.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing,'' Cone said. ''I was really looking forward to pitching that game. Joe feels like it's the best thing for the team to have Andy pitch that game, and I really can't argue with it considering the way I've thrown.''</p>
        <p>Cone had yet another ineffectual outing Tuesday, when he gave up four home runs in five and two-thirds innings in a loss to Baltimore. After winning 12 games last year and 20 in 1998 for the Yankees, Cone has not won this season since April 28. He is 1-7, with an earned run average of 6.40.</p>
        <p>Pettitte, meanwhile, has won seven of his last nine starts. Cone will be available to pitch from the bullpen Saturday, and he even put on his spikes yesterday and went down to the Yankees' bullpen when the pitching started to falter in the seventh inning of the 13-9 victory over Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''It's just more right now he's struggling, and it's an opportunity to bring in the hot hand in Andy Pettitte,'' said Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman, who emphasized that one reason the Yankees are passing over Cone is that the three-day All-Star Game break begins Monday. ''And hopefully, this will give David more time to work it out,'' he said. Both Cashman and Manager Joe Torre maintained that Cone would be back in the rotation for the second half of the season.</p>
        <p>If only Cone knew the root of his troubles. He has experimented with different arm angles, pitched from both sides of the rubber and worked with a different catcher, Chris Turner. Still, he has struggled to throw his fastball consistently to set up his slider. ''I haven't given up,'' Cone said, without sounding that convincing. ''I still have confidence that I can be effective.''</p>
        <p>Cone learned of his demotion in a pregame talk with Torre yesterday morning. ''He understood that if it wasn't for the All-Star break, we wouldn't do it,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Torre said Cone would be used carefully in any relieving stints this weekend, and would not be summoned with runners on the bases.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the day when Cone was relegated to the bullpen for one of the more intriguing series of the summer, against the Mets, he had to contemplate the fact that Dwight Gooden -- his teammate on the Mets and Yankees -- would be getting a start instead.</p>
        <p>''I think Doc can still pitch,'' Cone said. ''Maybe I'm a little biased because he's a friend of mine, but I'm really happy he's going to give us a chance.''</p>
        <p>Cashman insisted that the decision to call up Gooden -- which inevitably will be linked to the Yankees' owner, George Steinbrenner, who has now twice summoned Gooden from oblivion -- was not because he is a former Met. ''This is not theater; we are not in the movie business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there will be drama -- either if Gooden pitches well, or if he doesn't and then objects if the Yankees try to return him to the minor leagues. Under the basic labor agreement, Gooden cannot be sent down to the minor leagues without his permission, although the Yankees could choose to put him on waivers and then release him if he is not claimed.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees will have to make a roster move tomorrow morning when they bring up DWIGHT GOODEN. To make room for ED YARNALL yesterday, the Yankees optioned infielder CLAY BELLINGER to Class AAA Columbus yesterday. Bellinger, who made the team last year at age 30 after 11 seasons in the minor leagues, has been used sparingly this season, going 6 for 30 in 16 games for a .200 average. He must stay with Columbus for at least 10 days before any recall by the Yankees. . . . DON MATTINGLY, who has expressed interest in coaching with the Yankees, and possibly managing in the major leagues someday, will make his first appearance in a Yankees Old-Timers' Game on July 15. Mattingly, a nine-time Gold Glove winner at first base, retired after the 1995 season. He made an appearance at Yankee Stadium during last year's postseason and was a guest instructor at spring training.</p>
