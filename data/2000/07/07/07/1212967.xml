        <p>The Hurricane</p>
        <p>Telling the story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter (Denzel Washington, left), Norman Jewison's stirring but schmaltzy film lands every emotional jab and hook. Carter, the boxer who served 20 years in prison for murder, makes a brainy advocate for his own release. A book he writes about himself attracts a young reader (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who in turn interests three investigators from Canada (Liev Schreiber, John Hannah and Deborah Kara Unger) in taking up Carter's cause. Mr. Washington is powerful, but, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, ''his performance only partly camouflages the glaring flaws of a movie that is as blatantly manipulative as a pep rally.''</p>
        <p>1999. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 11.</p>
        <p>Boiler Room</p>
        <p>Beer-swilling Long Island boys in a cacophonous investment trading room pitch customers looking for fast killings and try to figure ways to spend all their own money. But there is a personal story, too. Seth (Giovanni Ribisi), a college dropout and former casino operator, strives to reconnect with his father (Ron Rifkin), a judge who disowns him. Written and directed by the 29-year-old Ben Younger, the film ''reflects the sensibility of the generation it holds up to critical scrutiny, and it's a cunningly ambiguous act of self-portraiture'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. New Line. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: July 11.</p>
        <p>Mansfield Park</p>
        <p>The setting in Patricia Rozema's adaptation of Jane Austen's novel seems familiar, but her smart, politically pointed screenplay features a protofeminist heroine and includes such modern touches as lesbianism and blatant drug addiction.</p>
        <p>Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), a slave trader, rules his estate with pompous authority while young Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor relative who is treated like a servant, persists in a film that ''is determined to invest Austen with as many prickly resonances as it can'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 110 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: July 11.</p>
        <p>My Dog Skip</p>
        <p>Far from the typical high-tech kiddie adventure, Jay Russell's leisurely, beautifully atmospheric film recreates the world Willie Morris wrote about in his book about his Mississippi childhood. The setting is a small town during World War II, and the action strays no farther than across the railroad tracks as a boy (Frankie Muniz) and his pup grow up together on leafy streets and in the embrace of loving parents (Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane). Yes, it gets gooey, but locations and performances ''help to make the film's relentless sentimentality more bearable than it otherwise might have been'' (Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. Warner. $22.96; DVD, $24.98. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: July 11.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>THE AUDREY HEPBURN STORY. Wearing her hair in a huge French twist popular in the early 1960's, Hepburn (Jennifer Love Hewitt) shows up on the set to play Holly Golightly, a sort-of call girl, in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Marilyn Monroe would have been better for the part, grumbles a man who looks like Truman Capote, author of the novella on which ''Breakfast'' is based. Roughly the same misgivings might be expressed about Ms. Hewitt in the role of Hepburn, who moved from a lonely upbringing to stardom on the stage and screen. Chronicling the Hepburn career, this film, made for ABC, never rises above its genre. But Ms. Hewitt, Anita Gates wrote in The New York Times, at least gets Hepburn's voice right and ''is not the disaster many people expected.'' 2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $19.96; DVD, $24.95. 133 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: July 11.</p>
        <p>UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS: THE FIFTH SEASON. Thirteen episodes from the last season of the acclaimed ''Masterpiece Theater'' series follow the Bellamy family and those who toil in their service from the start of the First World War to the confusing years after the Armistice. Seven cassettes, $99.95. 663 minutes.</p>
        <p>JACKSON POLLOCK. A BBC documentary treats the artist's life and work with archival film and includes interviews with Lee Krasner, Pollock's wife, and Ed Harris, who directs and stars in the new feature film ''Pollock.'' 1999. $29.95. 46 minutes.</p>
