        <p>Circus Star Tries To Tame Cancer</p>
        <p>The lord of the rings is facing his greatest challenge. The tiger trainer GUNTHER GEBEL-WILLIAMS, the best-known circus star of his era, who retired from performance 10 years ago, has had a cancerous brain tumor removed in a Sarasota, Fla., hospital. He will be undergoing radiation treatment.</p>
        <p>''He seems to have had no ill effects from some difficult surgery, and has made extraordinary progress,'' according to KENNETH FELD, producer and chief executive of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, who spoke yesterday afternoon from a phone outside the hospital room. ''He'll be able to go home from the hospital today.''</p>

        <p>Circus Star Tries To Tame Cancer</p>
        <p>The lord of the rings is facing his greatest challenge. The tiger trainer GUNTHER GEBEL-WILLIAMS, the best-known circus star of his era, who retired from performance 10 years ago, has had a cancerous brain tumor removed in a Sarasota, Fla., hospital. He will be undergoing radiation treatment.</p>
        <p>''He seems to have had no ill effects from some difficult surgery, and has made extraordinary progress,'' according to KENNETH FELD, producer and chief executive of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, who spoke yesterday afternoon from a phone outside the hospital room. ''He'll be able to go home from the hospital today.''</p>
        <p>On June 29, Mr. Gebel-Williams, a 65-year-old Ringling vice president who oversees training of Ringling's animals, was schooling some tigers before a performance in San Antonio.</p>
        <p>''I noticed that he was getting so close to the cats on his right side, it seemed he had no peripheral vision,'' said MARK OLIVER GEBEL, his 29-year-old son, also a tiger trainer, and a Ringling star.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gebel took his father to a San Antonio hospital, where two days of tests showed a tumor on the left side of his brain. On Sunday, Mr. Gebel-Williams was flown to Sarasota, where he lives. The tumor was removed Monday in Sarasota Memorial Hospital.</p>
        <p>''Although he now faces a battle against cancer, there are very few 65-year-old men who are in the shape that Gunther is in,'' Mr. Feld said of Mr. Gebel-Williams, who for decades put 500-pound tigers and 10,000-pound pachyderms through their paces. ''This is a very strong man who has overcome obstacles his entire life.''</p>
        <p>Cow Art Greets A Barbecue Man</p>
        <p>What did DON STRANGE, the Texas cattleman and barbecue impresario, make of the herd of cows that awaited him when he arrived in New York the other day? ''I thought that Rockefeller Center had really gone out of its way to make me feel at home,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strange referred, of course, to 10 painted cows arrayed in the Rockefeller Center's underground concourse, part of the herd of 500 such statues that make up the citywide art event called Cow Parade 2000.</p>
        <p>Blissfully unaware of cow art, Mr. Strange journeyed north last week to establish a barbecue beachhead until Labor Day at the Rock Center Cafe, in the concourse by the skating rink. There, he has set up large steel mesquite-fired barbecue smokers to offer his smoked brisket, pork ribs and chicken, part of a ''True Texas Barbecue'' menu.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strange, 60, has brought his barbecue to Republican and Democratic conventions and White House balls since 1957. The adorned cows, he said, ''make me miss my nonfiberglass herd in Welfare, Tex.''</p>
        <p>Costume Designer Repeats Role</p>
        <p>By accident, Broadway has found absolutely the best woman to dress ''The Best Man.'' ETHAN McSWEENY, director of the upcoming revival of the 1960 GORE VIDAL political satire about the race for the presidency, asked THEONI V. ALDREDGE to design the costumes for the show, which opens Sept. 17 at the Virginia Theater.</p>
        <p>''I will be more than happy,'' she replied, ''to be part of 'The Best Man' again.''</p>
        <p>Again? Seems that Ms. Aldredge designed the costumes for the original show, which starred MELVYN DOUGLAS. ''It was a pleasant surprise,'' said Ms. Aldredge yesterday, from her vacation retreat in Greece, ''because you feel selfish about anyone touching your work.''</p>
        <p>The designer was in her 20's in 1960 and now is ''nearing 70,'' she said, declining to add just how near.</p>
        <p>The 40th anniversary production, starring CHARLES DURNING, SPALDING GRAY, CHRIS NOTH and ELIZABETH ASHLEY, will not be given a millennial revision. So Ms. Aldredge will, she said, ''go for a 60's look.''</p>
