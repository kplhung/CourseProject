        <p>The Amistad freedom schooner, a reproduction of a historic ship on which slaves rebelled, pulled out of New York Harbor early yesterday morning to the disappointment of thousands of visitors who showed up at a pier off Battery Park to see the vessel.</p>
        <p>The ship left because the pier where it was supposed to moor, which is under construction, did not have adequate bumpers and safety guards to prevent the 136-ton ship from banging repeatedly against it, said Will H. Mebane, vice president of Amistad America, the owner and operator of the vessel.</p>
        <p>The crew was afraid the ship would be damaged if it remained there any longer, he said.</p>
        <p>Although Amistad America had surveyed the site before the ship set sail, Mr. Mebane said he did not expect the docking problems that would arise when 20,000 boats entered harbor for OpSail, creating enormous waves.</p>
        <p>But Annie Bliss, director of design for Pier A Operations, which runs the pier, said she had warned the Amistad crew that the waters were turbulent. She added that most large ships traveled with their own system of safety guards.</p>
        <p>''It's rough water on that side,'' she said. ''But I would say the inexperience of the Amistad crew working together was not helpful to the situation.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mebane said that with only one exception, every member of the nine-member crew had extensive sailing experience, many with similar schooners, and that the captain, Bill Pinkney, had circumnavigated the globe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mebane said the crew had been working together since April, and added, ''I'm not sure how that impacts whether or not there's an appropriate dock that's adequate to protect our vessel.''</p>
        <p>The Amistad, a reproduction of the vessel on which 53 Africans, destined for a life of slavery on a Cuban plantation, staged a violent revolt against their captors in 1839, made its maiden voyage on Monday, when it left Mystic, Conn., where it was built, to join Operation Sail 2000 in New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mebane said tens of thousands of sightseers visited the ship on Tuesday, although they were not allowed to board because there was a private, $100-per-person event on the pier that evening.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the vessel sailed to the Harlem piers, where the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and Amistad America held a special event, with presentations by the poet Maya Angelou and former Mayor David N. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>About 1,000 people attended the event, Mr. Mebane said, and 600 of them boarded the Amistad.</p>
        <p>Public viewing of the Amistad was to resume at Pier A yesterday morning, but after three days of working around the clock, fighting the currents to create makeshift bumpers to bolster the ship against crashing waves, the crew wearily set sail for Mystic, where the ship will be checked for damage.</p>
        <p>''It's very disappointing for us not to be able to be there for the rest of the week as planned,'' Mr. Mebane said, ''though all and all, it was an absolutely glorious experience for us to be in New York, because people really responded to us and to our captain, and being in Harlem was phenomenal.''</p>
        <p>Thousands of visitors were disheartened when they arrived at Pier A yesterday to see the ship. ''How annoying,'' said Leonard R. Pace, 55, a taxi driver from the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, when he arrived in front of a shuttered gate at the end of West Street, hoping to get a glimpse of the ship and perhaps meet its captain.</p>
        <p>''I was hoping to meet Captain Pinkney,'' he said, ''or if not that, at least get pictures to show the kids.''</p>
        <p>The Amistad will participate in Operation Sail 2000 in Mystic beginning next Wednesday, and will then sail to New Haven for public viewing there on July 15.</p>
