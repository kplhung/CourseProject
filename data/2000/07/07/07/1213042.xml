        <p>In the sequence of photographs in Tom Robson's briefcase, Robin Ventura displays the perfect swing. In all four pictures, said Robson, the Mets' hitting coach, you can draw a straight line down the middle and Ventura's head would be in the same place. The feet move first, then the hands follow through the hitting zone.</p>
        <p>Robson extends his thumb and pinkie on his right hand and folds over the three fingers in between. He twists his hand violently, symbolizing the high-speed rotation he sees in the photos. ''Bam!'' he said -- solid contact, a hard hit, the kind Ventura got so often last year but struggles to get now.</p>

        <p>In the sequence of photographs in Tom Robson's briefcase, Robin Ventura displays the perfect swing. In all four pictures, said Robson, the Mets' hitting coach, you can draw a straight line down the middle and Ventura's head would be in the same place. The feet move first, then the hands follow through the hitting zone.</p>
        <p>Robson extends his thumb and pinkie on his right hand and folds over the three fingers in between. He twists his hand violently, symbolizing the high-speed rotation he sees in the photos. ''Bam!'' he said -- solid contact, a hard hit, the kind Ventura got so often last year but struggles to get now.</p>
        <p>Ventura, the Mets' third baseman, set career highs last season with a .301 average and 120 runs batted in while playing in all but two games. This year, his average has decreased every month -- from .261 in April to .241 in May to .213 in June -- and he is batting .242 heading into this weekend's series with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>He has 16 home runs and 53 R.B.I., but he said he knows he has not been the hitter depicted in Robson's gallery. ''You feel comfortable for a couple of days, then it's like you come to the park and you feel like you've never swung a bat before,'' Ventura said. ''There's seasons that you have that are like that. You have no idea -- no matter what you do, it's just a struggle.''</p>
        <p>Ventura knows exactly what he is doing wrong. Instead of keeping his head stationary, he has a habit of drifting forward with his upper body. When a hitter drifts, there is little force behind his swing, less torque -- and, ultimately, more weak grounders and infield pop-ups.</p>
        <p>This is a fairly common problem, and Ventura said he has battled it often. He could try to change his swing, he said, but this is one of those years when correcting one problem would only produce another. Try a new approach without getting the right pitch, and things might only get worse.</p>
        <p>''It's all about balance, and you just can't feel balanced,'' Ventura said. ''You have some physical things that don't let you do certain things, and that's just the way it is. There's nothing you can do about it. Just go out there and do what you can do.''</p>
        <p>Ventura has a different body than he had last year. He is in his 12th major league season, and nearly 1,500 games have taken their toll. He had surgery on his left knee and right shoulder last winter, and while his throwing has been unaffected because he so rarely needs to throw as hard as he can, his hitting mechanics have suffered.</p>
        <p>''Day to day, it doesn't feel the same,'' Ventura said. ''When you have surgeries, there's just different feelings that you have. I think every player has it -- physically, you're different every day.</p>
        <p>''I feel better than I did at the end of last year. Are you where you want to be forever? I think from surgery, you just continue to get stronger. At the middle of the season, from this point forward, I'm going to find a point where things are going to be a lot more comfortable. That only translates into the way you play. There will be a period where I get confident at the plate and things start to feel right.''</p>
        <p>His body is different, and so is the lineup around him. Ventura is the only left-handed hitter in the Mets' regular lineup, a factor that some thought would hurt the Mets against right-handed pitchers.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Mets hit right-handers much better than they hit lefties, and it is Ventura who feels the effect of the imbalance.</p>
        <p>Ventura's best seasons, 1996 and 1999, were the two in which he had another left-handed hitter in the middle of the lineup: Harold Baines with the Chicago White Sox in 1996 and John Olerud last year. Ventura regularly consulted with Baines and Olerud on what pitchers were throwing, and he cannot do that anymore.</p>
        <p>Olerud now plays for Seattle, of course, and the Mets' left-handed-hitting outfielder Darryl Hamilton has yet to begin another rehabilitation assignment to test his injured left big toe.</p>
        <p>With no point in waiting for another left-handed hitter to join him, Ventura simply waits to get hot.</p>
        <p>''I think that's the good thing for now, at least to rely on, is that I feel I'm still going to go on a streak that will help the club,'' Ventura said. ''I guess that's the good news.''</p>
        <p>When Ventura considers last season, he doesn't think his production was so spectacular that he could never duplicate it. But he entered this year with a .277 career average; hitting .300 has been the exception, not the norm.</p>
        <p>''You do want to build off it, but if you did it once, that doesn't mean you're going to do it five times in a row,'' Robson said. ''He could have a year this year where he hits .250-.260, and the next year he's .295.''</p>
        <p>Then again, Ventura said, individual performance does not really matter. In 1993, he batted .262 but played for a division-winning team and loved it. He is happy again this year because the Mets are in playoff contention.</p>
        <p>Ventura's drive home to Connecticut is easy when the Mets win, he said, regardless of his performance. Even with his struggles, Ventura hasn't lost his perspective -- or his sense of humor.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of guys doing well,'' Ventura said. ''I don't think I'm a dead leg; it's just one of those things that you wish you could do better. Guys joke about it. I'll get a couple of hits and we lose, and it's like, well, if it takes me going 0 for the rest of the year to win the games, I guess I've got to do it.''</p>
