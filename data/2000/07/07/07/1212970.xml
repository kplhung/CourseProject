        <p>During the summer of 1956, after graduating from high school, Ed Ruscha left his home in Oklahoma City, hopped into his 1950 Ford and headed west on Route 66 for Los Angeles, where he was going to become a commercial artist.</p>
        <p>His timing was good. An art scene was shaping up. Walter Hopps and Ed Kienholz were about to open the Ferus Gallery. A group that included John Altoon, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Ed Moses, Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman and Robert Irwin was soon to coalesce and get national attention. Within a few years, the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art would open; the Pasadena Art Museum would be a place to see new art; June Wayne would start the Tamarind Lithography Workshop, which spawned Gemini G.E.L., one of the country's best printmaking shops; and Artforum magazine would briefly settle in Los Angeles.</p>

        <p>During the summer of 1956, after graduating from high school, Ed Ruscha left his home in Oklahoma City, hopped into his 1950 Ford and headed west on Route 66 for Los Angeles, where he was going to become a commercial artist.</p>
        <p>His timing was good. An art scene was shaping up. Walter Hopps and Ed Kienholz were about to open the Ferus Gallery. A group that included John Altoon, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Ed Moses, Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman and Robert Irwin was soon to coalesce and get national attention. Within a few years, the new Los Angeles County Museum of Art would open; the Pasadena Art Museum would be a place to see new art; June Wayne would start the Tamarind Lithography Workshop, which spawned Gemini G.E.L., one of the country's best printmaking shops; and Artforum magazine would briefly settle in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The art produced was eclectic, but the city came to be associated with the kind of work that Mr. Ruscha exemplified. It was cool, sly, deceptively mechanical-looking. It had a self-regarding, matter-of-fact charisma.</p>
        <p>In his case especially, it was born of laconic Western spaces, strip malls, highways and the Technicolor movie. Increasingly it came to be about film, an art about art.</p>
        <p>If you can catch the traveling retrospective of Mr. Ruscha's 40-year career, now here at the Hirshhorn Museum, you should do so. Mr. Ruscha's scrutiny of the world is truly American, and his art hovers tantalizingly on the edge of slapstick, with enough intimation of melancholy to keep you guessing. Its rewards are not exactly tactile or sensual, paint being used interchangeably with eccentric materials like vanishing cream and blueberries as if they were equally dubious propositions for art, but the results are more than just cerebral.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruscha navigates a pregnant space between Pop and Conceptual art. You read the words he paints, his ironic titles, and see how they mix with his images, and you're sure something is up, just not always precisely what. A sleight-of-hand brand of humor is at work, which derives both from a natural lightness of spirit and a refusal to condescend or moralize. Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol are the obvious names with which to reckon in his case, but Mr. Ruscha's buoyancy separates him, creditably, and has kept him bobbing along consistently through the decades.</p>
        <p>The familiar story is that he had one of those eureka moments when he saw a reproduction of a Johns ''Target'' painting in a magazine in 1957. It gave him the conviction that he didn't have to splash paint around like the Abstract Expressionists to be a serious artist. He went to art school to study commercial design and got a job as a layout artist and graphic designer for a local advertising agency, but he realized that he didn't want to do that after all. He decided to travel in Europe, where he saw more works by Mr. Johns and by Robert Rauschenberg in Paris, and on the way back he saw a Roy Lichtenstein show in New York.</p>
        <p>His early pictures combined his diverse experiences differently. His first mature paintings, nods to Mr. Johns, consisted of words: ''boss'' painted in big, greasy black capital letters on a muddy brown backdrop, and ''ace,'' its letters made into even more of a sculpture in relief. The self-aggrandizing irony of the titles spoke for itself.</p>
        <p>Then came ''Large Trademark With Eight Spotlights,'' which recreated the 20th Century Fox logo, with its roving spotlights, on a big, horizontal canvas, as if on a wide screen. It was organized in oblique-angle one-point perspective, the surface flat, opaque and anonymous, unlike ''Boss'' or ''Ace.'' This would become Mr. Ruscha's consistent mode: deadpan, sneakily enigmatic. In its use of typefaces and lettering, it also exploited his commercial training -- the towering T in ''The Mountain'' is an example. And it was attached to icons of Los Angeles and the West.</p>
        <p>So when he painted a Standard Oil gas station in the same format as the 20th Century Fox logo, he was again glorifying a Western symbol, this time of the highway, and now additionally implying the experience of driving past it, one-point perspective creating a cartoon effect of the station as if we were rushing past it in our own 1950 Ford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruscha described what he wanted: ''The image of a train that we have from movies is from lower right to upper left; it is a force of exaggeration that we've seen many times. It parallels the concept of speed, going from nowhere to somewhere, nowhere to everywhere. If you can get that into a painting, then there is a sense of accomplishment. There's a kind of conviction in the awkwardness of doing that that appealed to me.''</p>
        <p>You could say that the appeal of awkwardness became one of his themes. The plain little books of photographs he put together in the early 60's depicting gas stations, ordinary apartment buildings, swimming pools and parking lots -- tremendously influential on younger artists -- were snapshots of nowhere places, often indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>But like the painting of the Standard Oil station, they can seem awkwardly beautiful even as they raise the question, What's the point? The images are curiously numbered (34 parking lots; 26 gasoline stations; 9 swimming pools), as if a meaning might be involved, or is there no meaning? Maybe the images are just another way for Mr. Ruscha to number pages in a book. You just can't be sure.</p>
        <p>A conceptual game, but time has a way of lending even the most conceptual and nondescript of these early images a degree of nostalgia. Works in the show like ''Noise, Pencil, Broken Pencil, Cheap Western,'' with its reproduction of an old dime comic book, have a retrospective charm that was presumably the reverse of their original intent. Except that in his ambiguity, Mr. Ruscha leaves enough room for us to shift our chairs around and get an occasional view from the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>Nostalgia isn't bad, it turns out. With their simulation of scratchy black-and-white films, Mr. Ruscha's recent paintings bask in it.</p>
        <p>Then, on top of that, there is an unexpected lyricism to the best work.</p>
        <p>It derives partly from the sheer fluency of the surfaces, the words and images as smooth as polished stones in a clear stream, with the concomitant result that meaning flows over them without sticking.</p>
        <p>A few of his word-pictures end up as not much more than coy one-liners: ''ice'' in red-hot letters, ''space'' in comic-book sci-fi typeface against an almost empty blue field, and a squiggly ''jelly.'' But sometimes his words floating in vast colored fields or against Hollywood backdrops can take on a surprising aspect akin to actors isolated on a stage. They can look remarkably vulnerable.</p>
        <p>And this is another source of the art's lyrical effect. Mr. Ruscha, like Mr. Johns, is famous for untethering words from their moorings, exploiting linguistic instability to imply an instability in our grasp of experience generally. A different way of putting this is to say that his words and images get to make themselves over in his pictures. They are largely freed from their past and go out into the world with a fresh identity and maybe a chance at a few minutes in the spotlight.</p>
        <p>It's a classic American dream. And it also happens to be Mr. Ruscha's story.</p>
        <p>''Ed Ruscha'' is at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Independence Avenue at Seventh Street, SW, Washington, (202) 357-1300, through Sept. 17. It travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago (Nov. 20 to Feb. 5, 2001), the Miami Art Museum (March 22, 2001, to June 3, 2001), the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (July 1, 2001, to Sept. 30, 2001) and the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, England (Oct. 28, 2001, to Jan. 13, 2002).</p>
