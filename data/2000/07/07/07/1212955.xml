        <p>The flame kept by the owner of a Berlin cigar store in 1946 seems unremarkable at first glance -- a wisp of fire produced by the kind of metal lighter that was seen in the hands of American soldiers in World War II so often that many civilians thought they were standard government issue.</p>
        <p>In Amos Kamil's play ''The Flame Keeper,'' the merchant keeps whipping the lighter out of his pocket every time a very annoying customer asks, as one would in German, ''Do you have a fire?''</p>
        <p>In fact, deep inside, hidden from the searching gaze of anyone, including himself, the merchant keeps a fire intense enough to burn away more certainties and suppositions about history than those swept away by the ideological firestorms ignited by Hitler.</p>
        <p>It is 1946 when Julius Reiter, a philosophy professor who escaped to Palestine before the war, comes into the shop of Ernst Gruber. In Lenny Mandel's creation, Reiter has all the benevolence and deference of a tornado. He has obviously been tormenting Gruber daily for some time, determined to sweep away the illusions and evasions of this businessman, who bought the establishment after its previous owner, a Jew whom both of these men knew, had been driven out by the Nazis eight years before.</p>
        <p>But Paul Whelihan makes Gruber a man who, while he puts a high value on what he calls ''the veneer of civility,'' has no illusions and is as contemptuous of evasion as he is impervious to Reiter's probing. Furthermore, he can match citations and allusions with this professor, who can make the dealer repeatedly climb a steep ladder to fetch rare cigars so he can decide he does not want them but who cannot make him confess how he acquired the business.</p>
        <p>Their battle of wits is enthralling -- but then, if you take your talk from Descartes, Spinoza, Nietzsche and Rilke, it is likely to be impressive, and here it rises at times to eloquence. If Reiter can suggest that some things both of them witnessed in the war years were evil, Spinoza can be called on to question whether any clear line can be found between good and evil, and Gruber even seems a bit heroic when he refuses ''to apologize for surviving.''</p>
        <p>Gruber does have a secret, of course, and when it finally bursts out of him, it has the force of an intellectual explosion. All of Reiter's confident justification for creating a Jewish state collapses, as does the elaborate imposture Gruber had been unable to drop even a year after the Third Reich disappeared in smoke. The argument really comes down to a search for what faith is, what is the reality of a selfless quest in a world acting on the conviction that God is dead. At the end, the flame Gruber has kept shines, but its origin is a mystery. In this play, Mr. Kamil tosses out a challenge in the debate over what it means to be Jewish. But at one point Gruber objects to Reiter that ''the world is not like philosophy,'' and this play is very much like philosophy through most of its 80 minutes. It depends almost entirely on the actors and the director, Charles Goforth, to bring it to life. For the most part they succeed.</p>
        <p>Their confrontation changes both of these men profoundly; gradually the transformations become palpable in this performance, and a viewer's own emotional response pulls the play into the world that is not like philosophy.</p>
