        <p>ROADS  By Larry McMurtry  206 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $25.</p>
        <p>The bittersweet scent of loss has always wafted through Larry McMurtry's fiction, creating a mood of wistful melancholy. Whether writing about the waning of the Old West in ''Lonesome Dove'' and ''Streets of Laredo'' or simply chronicling an aging woman's reminiscences and regrets in ''The Evening Star,'' he has always been acutely attuned to the wages of time and change. His latest book, ''Roads,'' is no exception. Though the volume is simply an account of his desultory travels through the United States, it leaves the reader with a haunting sense of how the country has changed in the last half-century.</p>
        <p>''Roads'' traces a series of drives that Mr. McMurtry took in his spare time along America's great interstates: from Baltimore to Burlington, Colo., on I-70; from Los Angeles to Albuquerque on the 10, the 15 and the 40; from Washington to Dallas via the 66, 81, 40 and the 30, and so on, from East to West, from North to South.</p>

        <p>ROADS  By Larry McMurtry  206 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $25.</p>
        <p>The bittersweet scent of loss has always wafted through Larry McMurtry's fiction, creating a mood of wistful melancholy. Whether writing about the waning of the Old West in ''Lonesome Dove'' and ''Streets of Laredo'' or simply chronicling an aging woman's reminiscences and regrets in ''The Evening Star,'' he has always been acutely attuned to the wages of time and change. His latest book, ''Roads,'' is no exception. Though the volume is simply an account of his desultory travels through the United States, it leaves the reader with a haunting sense of how the country has changed in the last half-century.</p>
        <p>''Roads'' traces a series of drives that Mr. McMurtry took in his spare time along America's great interstates: from Baltimore to Burlington, Colo., on I-70; from Los Angeles to Albuquerque on the 10, the 15 and the 40; from Washington to Dallas via the 66, 81, 40 and the 30, and so on, from East to West, from North to South.</p>
        <p>The trips were made with no real destination in mind: the routes chosen by whim, the direction by impulse and intuition. Mr. McMurtry's one aim, it seems, was to avoid traffic congestion, roads under repair and heavily traveled truck routes while also renouncing the sort of small picturesque roads that William Least Heat Moon traversed in his 1983 book ''Blue Highways.'' As a result ''Roads'' has a decidedly improvisatory air: it lacks the obsessive quality that Mr. McMurtry himself says distinguishes the best travel writing and it often suffers, like ''Flim Flam,'' his 1987 book on Hollywood, from a curiously perfunctory tone.</p>
        <p>In his restless drive to keep moving, Mr. McMurtry often passes by the oddest, most interesting sights. He toys with stopping at a roadside attraction that features a 500-pound man-killing clam but when he notices that the site is closed he makes no effort to return. He similarly bypasses the famed Meteor Crater in Arizona because he doesn't want to contend with the traffic. As for his views on the shortcomings of Texas cities like Austin and San Antonio, he simply refers the reader to one of his earlier books.</p>
        <p>Still, ''Roads'' is not without its modest pleasures: it's like a long, meandering road trip with an affable raconteur who likes to comment on the landscape glimpsed through the windshield while reminiscing about earlier visits to the region and books he once read. Visits to northern Michigan and Key West, of course, elicit riffs on Hemingway while Mississippi evokes memories of books by Faulkner and Eudora Welty. Works by lesser-known writers are cited as well, most notably ''We Pointed Them North'' by Teddy Blue and Helena Huntington Smith, a book Mr. McMurtry hails as ''the single best memoir of the cowboy era.''</p>
        <p>In addition to writing novels, Mr. McMurtry has long had a second career as an antiquarian bookman, and that job has taken him over the years to remote corners of the country. Indeed this volume attests to his easy familiarity with a plethora of regions and roads -- the sort of familiarity that has helped him lend the sprawling country the intimate feel of a small town in novels like ''Buffalo Girls.''</p>
        <p>He remembers the days in West Virginia before the interstate highways were built, when he ''crawled painfully across the state, usually on mountain roads that offered no opportunities to pass the many under-powered coal trucks that would be groaning up the hills at two or three miles an hour, in their lowest gear.'' And he remembers commuting between his two homes in Washington and Archer City, Texas, a route he has driven some 60 times, ''enough to have acquainted myself with virtually every gas station and convenience store along the way.''</p>
        <p>Driving that route today, he observes, ''it occurs to me that my effort was obliquely Proustian, a retracing of my past that is analogous to the many rereadings I've done in the last few years'' of favorite books. After heart surgery left him feeling alienated and ghostly, it was a way to reconnect with his former self, to reacquaint himself with ''elements of my old personality that are still unaccounted for.''</p>
        <p>In this volume, however, Mr. McMurtry does not dwell on his own feelings but focuses rather on the changes in America he observes as he retraces favorite roads. He notes the proliferation of casinos and outlet malls across the country and comments on the arrival of ''nouveau ranchers'' in Texas who decorate the entrances to their spreads with statuary modeled on the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
        <p>''The development of credit-card gas pumps, microwaves, and express motels has eliminated the necessity for human contact along the interstates,'' he writes. ''It is now possible to drive coast to coast without speaking to a human being at all: you just slide your card, pump your gas, buy a couple of Hershey bars, perhaps heat up a burrito, and put the pedal back to the metal.''</p>
        <p>The most eloquent chapter in this slender book deals with Mr. McMurtry's memories of the ranch he grew up on in Texas, and the small, unnamed roads he traversed as a boy -- on horseback, by mule cart and later by truck. Mr. McMurtry recalls the waning days of the trail drive (soon to be replaced by the advent of big cattle trucks) and the squabbling produced by the county's decision, in the centennial year of 1980, to name some local roads in honor of prominent pioneer families. Some residents who did not like the name given to the road past their homes just cut down the sign, he recalls; ''some roads had to be named two or three times before the citizens who lived along them'' felt that ''the committee of road namers had finally got it right.''</p>
        <p>In this chapter the hasty travel chat of the book's earlier portions gives way to something deeper and more moving. The reader only wishes that Mr. McMurtry had spent more time in this volume on the dirt roads of his youth than on the impersonal interstates of today.</p>
