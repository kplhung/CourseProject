        <p>Given New York's hate-hate relationship with motor vehicles -- on the one hand, their numbers and bulk make the streets impassable; on the other hand, their fumes and noise foul the atmosphere -- it is hard to imagine a day when mid-Manhattan was the automotive Acropolis of America.</p>
        <p>But there was such a time. And there was such a place: Automobile Row, a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the 40's to the 70's, lined with car makers, tire companies and dealerships by the dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ''Three P's'' of luxury motoring -- Packard, Peerless and Pierce (makers of the Arrow) -- jostling for attention with Babcock Electrics and White Steamers, Hupmobiles, Loziers, Overlands, Reos and Speedwells.</p>

        <p>Given New York's hate-hate relationship with motor vehicles -- on the one hand, their numbers and bulk make the streets impassable; on the other hand, their fumes and noise foul the atmosphere -- it is hard to imagine a day when mid-Manhattan was the automotive Acropolis of America.</p>
        <p>But there was such a time. And there was such a place: Automobile Row, a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the 40's to the 70's, lined with car makers, tire companies and dealerships by the dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ''Three P's'' of luxury motoring -- Packard, Peerless and Pierce (makers of the Arrow) -- jostling for attention with Babcock Electrics and White Steamers, Hupmobiles, Loziers, Overlands, Reos and Speedwells.</p>
        <p>''In great halls of baronial aspect, on Oriental rugs and marble floors, under little whispering galleries where the salesmen retire to their orisons, America's most shining triumphs are displayed,'' Christopher Morley wrote in his 1923 essay ''Round Columbus Circle.''</p>
        <p>The salesmen -- and the prayers they offered -- have long since vanished. But much of Automobile Row remains. It is simply hiding in plain sight, like so much of New York history.</p>
        <p>Though the last dealer decamped to 11th Avenue in 1985, many architectural monuments of Manhattan's automotive history can still be seen: buildings by masters like Carrere &amp; Hastings, Shreve &amp; Lamb, Albert Kahn, Francis Hatch Kimball, William Welles Bosworth and Howard Van Doren Shaw.</p>
        <p>One small treasure of Automobile Row, the 92-year-old former Goelet Garage at the northeast corner of 64th Street, is headed for the scrap heap. The six-story loft building, now known as 1926 Broadway, is to be demolished next year and replaced by a 29-story apartment tower.</p>
        <p>Admirers of the Goelet building, which is distinguished by broad window bays intricately framed in white terra cotta, had urged its designation as a landmark.</p>
        <p>''The word garage does not adequately describe how this building originally functioned,'' the preservationist Christopher W. London wrote in a recent historical analysis of 1926 Broadway. Instead, he said, it was a ''select emporium engaged principally in the exclusive manufacture, repair, service and sales of this recently developed, fashionable technological tool.'' Before automobiles were mass-produced on assembly lines, Mr. London noted, they were more painstakingly constructed in small-scale ''boutique'' shops, like the coaches they supplanted.</p>
        <p>Last year the Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to designate the Goelet Garage. But several automotive buildings south of Columbus Circle are to be considered for landmark status, beginning with the former United States Rubber Company Building, now known as 1790 Broadway, at the southeast corner of 58th Street.</p>
        <p>Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the commission, said the study of the Goelet Garage had ''focused us on the importance of automobiles in the history of the city and motivated us to ensure the protection of the important icons of the industry while they're still intact.''</p>
        <p>From Horse to Horsepower</p>
        <p>Automobile Row succeeded the carriage-and-harness district around Longacre Square, as Times Square was called in the 19th century. Every so often, startling reminders come to light. Two years ago, for instance, the demolition of a building at Broadway and 47th Street revealed a jumbo hand-painted sign on an adjacent wall for ''J. A. Keal's Carriage Manufactory.''</p>
        <p>By the early 1900's, Automobile Row was a kind of proto-Silicon Alley, a jumble of hungry entrepreneurs peddling an emerging technology in a bewildering variety of forms to a credulous -- and growing -- public.</p>
        <p>Embodying the transition from horse-drawn to horseless transportation is the former Studebaker Building, 1600 Broadway, on the northeast corner of 48th Street. Built in 1902 and designed by James Brown Lord, it was a 10-story factory and office for the Studebaker Brothers Company, makers of automobiles, carriages and wagons.</p>
        <p>In 1909, Studebaker held what it called the ''most comprehensive exhibit of motorcars ever shown by any one maker'' in its salesroom: seven-passenger touring cars, suburbans, roadsters, runabouts, coupes, limousines, landaulets, ambulances, delivery wagons, 10-ton trucks and ''electric pleasure vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Studebaker moved uptown in 1911 and went out of business in 1966. Its old showroom is now the Texas Texas restaurant. Even though the red-brick building lost its cornice 12 years ago, it is still a solid presence on Times Square, with chamfered corners and broad arched windows.</p>
        <p>Where Ford Reigned</p>
        <p>Proceeding uptown on Broadway -- something best done on foot -- the next milestone is the handsome former Ford Motor Company Building on the northeast corner of 54th Street. It is now the headquarters of Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. A branch of the Amalgamated Bank, which the union owns, occupies the former Ford showroom.</p>
        <p>Built in 1917, the six-story Ford Building was designed by Albert Kahn, arguably the foremost American industrial architect of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Its red-tile hipped roof brings an unexpectedly Mediterranean touch to the Broadway canyon, while its crisply linear limestone facade is enlivened by fluted spandrel panels with classical escutcheons set into recessed window bays. The building  is related aesthetically to an engineering laboratory in Dearborn, Mich., that Kahn designed for Ford eight years later.</p>
        <p>In the middle of World War II, when civilian automobile production had stopped and gasoline and tires were being rationed, Ford sold its building to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the forerunner of Unite, which was headed by David Dubinsky.</p>
        <p>Ford left behind a 10-by-20-foot automobile-size elevator -- larger than some studio apartments in Manhattan -- and matching curved nine-foot Art Deco desks made for Henry Ford and his son, Edsel, who was president of the company until his death in 1943.</p>
        <p>The delicious paradox of a labor organization's occupying a deluxe structure built by a famously anti-union company was not lost on Dubinsky or anyone around him, including the young Jay Mazur, who grew up in the I.L.G. and is now president of Unite. In fact, Mr. Mazur said, Dubinsky happily appropriated the Fords' custom furniture.</p>
        <p>''We made sure that people knew this was Ford's building,'' Mr. Mazur recalled with undiminished gusto. ''Dubinsky used to say: 'See? I'm sitting at Edsel Ford's desk!' For him, it was a badge of honor that he could show the world, that his union was part of the establishment.''</p>
        <p>A Chateau-Style Clubhouse</p>
        <p>Today, Ford owns another Kahn building, 787 11th Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, completed in 1929 as the Packard Motor Car Company Service Building. The massiveness of this eight-story industrial structure is relieved by vaguely Mayan gargoyles along the parapet, giant rosettes and fluted pilasters. It is a one-and-a-half-mile detour from the Broadway itinerary, but you can always buy a car while you're there.</p>
        <p>A much shorter detour takes you to the former home of the Automobile Club of America at 250 West 55th Street, a 12-story buff-brick building just west of Broadway. Within an ornamental niche above the second story, the legend ''A C A 1910'' can still be faintly discerned.</p>
        <p>This structure was an annex to a far more sumptuous eight-story clubhouse at 247 West 54th Street, built in 1907 and designed by Ernest Flagg, the architect of the Scribner Building at 597 Fifth Avenue. (The club moved out long ago, and the Beaux-Arts facade was replaced by plain white brick. The structure is now the State Labor Department Community Service Center.)</p>
        <p>Besides garage space for 350 cars, the Automobile Club offered its members a 100-foot-long assembly hall modeled on the Chateau de Cheverny in France; a grill room that could feed 300 hungry motorists at a time; a billiard hall; a library; and accommodations for chauffeurs. The 55th Street annex had space for 600 more cars and a restaurant, barber shop and Turkish baths.</p>
        <p>The organization is now the Automobile Club of New York, an affiliate of AAA, with headquarters in Garden City. But it maintains a travel agency at 1881 Broadway, which was once the Walter C. Martin Cadillac dealership. This Triple A branch on the northwest corner of 62nd Street may be the last functioning vestige of Automobile Row.</p>
        <p>Down 54th Street from the old Automobile Club is a nondescript two-story structure at 1711 Broadway that was once a Reo Motor Car dealership. Reo was founded by Ransom Eli Olds (that is, R.E.O.), who also put his name on the Oldsmobile.</p>
        <p>Up ahead, gleaming like a frosted Gothic angel cake, is the nine-story Argonaut Building, 224 West 57th Street, another potential landmark. Festooned with decorative details -- lion's-head brackets, grotesques and stars-and-stripes shields -- the structure was designed by Francis Hatch Kimball to harmonize with the Broadway Tabernacle church, which once stood next door at Broadway and 56th Street.</p>
        <p>Actually, Kimball designed two harmonious structures in 1909: the A. T. Demarest &amp; Company Building, at the southeast corner of Broadway and 57th Street, and the Peerless Motor Car Company Building, an L-shaped affair that wrapped around the Demarest Building, with facades on both Broadway and 57th Street.</p>
        <p>In the Demarest showroom were Renaults, known as ''the Pride of France,'' and Italas from Turin. Peerless -- ''All That The Name Implies'' -- was a celebrated luxury carmaker that reached the end of its road in 1932, during the Depression.</p>
        <p>The fledgling General Motors Corporation bought the Demarest and Peerless Buildings in 1916 and combined them. A Cadillac dealership remained on the ground floor for many years, in what is now a Duane Reade drugstore. A remnant of the G.M. days is the word ''Corporation'' in a rooftop sign.</p>
        <p>Mixing Yesterday and Today</p>
        <p>General Motors moved in 1927 to its own building, 1775 Broadway, at the northwest corner of 57th Street, designed by Shreve &amp; Lamb, later the architects of the Empire State Building. This 26-story tower rose atop the earlier three-story Colonnade Building by William Welles Bosworth, seemingly supported by its mammoth, trunklike Ionic columns. They now frame the windows of Coliseum Books.</p>
        <p>With a series of setbacks, this powerfully spare composition recalled the mesas of the Southwest -- if mesas had been topped by electric General Motors signs. The building is now home to Newsweek, and the sign now advertises the A&amp;E ''Biography'' series.</p>
        <p>In 1977, the Hearst Corporation acquired the Argonaut Building, where it had been a tenant for many years. Cosmopolitan, Cosmo Girl, Country Living, Popular Mechanics and Redbook are among the Hearst magazines based there today.</p>
        <p>Hearst has operated on and around Columbus Circle since 1895, when William Randolph Hearst bought the Virginia Hotel at 59th Street and turned it into the office of The New York Journal. Today, Hearst's Esquire magazine is in the former Automobile Club annex on 55th Street, and its Classic American Homes and Marie Claire magazines are in the former United States Rubber Building. (Its corporate headquarters, at Eighth Avenue and 57th Street, are only a block from Automobile Row.)</p>
        <p>A Monument to Tires</p>
        <p>The 20-story tower built in 1912 for United States Rubber, the forerunner of Uniroyal, is the cynosure of Automobile Row.</p>
        <p>Clad in Vermont marble and crowned with a broad copper cornice, it meets the oblique intersection of Broadway and 58th Street with a rounded prow, resembling a 275-foot stack of tires, and hovers over Columbus Circle like an alabaster version of the Flatiron Building.</p>
        <p>Carrere &amp; Hastings, the architects of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, designed the building. They specified rubber-tile floors and marble trim for the ground-floor United States Tire showroom. Altered beyond recognition in 1959, this space is now a branch of the HSBC Bank.</p>
        <p>The ornate elevator lobby was reclaimed in 1986 after an associate in the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle discovered rosettes and a frieze above the modern dropped ceiling.</p>
        <p>Ms. Raab, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said the building was likely to be designated this fall. The owners are not opposed, said their lawyer, Mark A. Levine of Herrick, Feinstein, and are even planning to light the tower at night to show off its architectural features.</p>
        <p>End of the Road</p>
        <p>Next door, at 1780 Broadway, is another potential landmark, the 12-story former B. F. Goodrich Company Building, completed in 1909 and designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Though not as exuberant as its neighbor, the facade warrants a second look for its novel combination of neo-Classical and Vienna Secessionist motifs surrounding horizontal window bays worthy of the Chicago School of architecture.</p>
        <p>Carrere &amp; Hastings and Shreve, Lamb &amp; Blake designed the 26-story Fisk Building at 250 West 57th Street, on the southwest corner of Broadway, which is now undergoing a $10 million, two-year renovation by its owners, a partnership that includes Peter L. Malkin. At least through the late 1930's, the building was ornamented by the Fisk Rubber Company's trademark image: a sleepy young boy in pajamas, candle in one hand and a tire slung over his shoulder. ''Time to Re-tire?'' the sign asked.</p>
        <p>Donald B. Kaplan, who managed the building in the late 1970's, recalls seeing the sign as a young boy. ''It was something I could identify with because I wore Dr. Denton's, too,'' he said, ''though we did not live by candlelight.''</p>
        <p>Fisk was acquired by U.S. Rubber in 1939, but Mr. Malkin has no plans to retire the name on the building. ''We just feel that the name is known and has some marketing value,'' he said.</p>
