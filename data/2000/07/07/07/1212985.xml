        <p>THE woman in the green Plymouth minivan honked repeatedly and gestured. Immobilized in rush hour at the clogged spot where three suburban Detroit freeways converge, I knew I had not cut her off, nor had our bumpers kissed. Puzzled, I rolled down my window.</p>
        <p>''Is that Vapor?'' she asked excitedly, pointing to my shiny blue Volkswagen, just three days old. I nodded. She responded with a thumbs-up.</p>
        <p>It was the first of a dozen such encounters in the month since I took delivery of my New Beetle, one of 4,000 special editions available only through VW's Web site. During May and June, VW offered 2,000 Beetles in Vapor, a pale blue meant to evoke the original baby-blue Beetle, and 2,000 in Reflex Yellow, a color akin to that of New York taxis. They were the first new colors since the Beetle went on sale in the summer of 1998.</p>
        <p>In buying my Bug, I joined a growing number of consumers who are making car deals online, in whole or in part. CNW Marketing Research, a market-research firm in Bandon, Ore., estimates that nearly 10 percent of new car buyers within the last year -- some 1.6 million people -- ordered or paid for vehicles over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Among them is Rhyder McClure, a computer consultant in New York City, who recently bought an ML430 sport utility through the Mercedes-Benz Web site (www.mbusa.com). He likes the convenience of shopping on the Web, and often orders groceries, gifts and clothing online. ''Since the day I could buy things on the Internet, I have,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClure accomplished all but the final step on line. Placing a deposit on his $45,000 vehicle required a visit to Mercedes-Benz of Manhattan on West 41st Street, where, in five minutes, a salesman completed the necessary electronic forms.</p>
        <p>In contrast, I did not visit a dealership until I went in to claim my keys. My purchase followed a confluence of events. First, my next-door neighbors, Trish and Eric Promersberger, asked if I would consider selling my 1994 Honda Accord.</p>
        <p>Almost simultaneously, my young nephews weighed in. Benjamin Maynard, 8, has been a fan of the New Beetle since it first came out, giving me gifts of Beetle-shaped cookies and a poster. This spring, his 4-year-old brother, Parker, asked, ''Auntie Micki, when will you have your Beetle car again?'' He was referring to test cars I had driven.</p>
        <p>But the deciding factor was a VW press release promoting the company's online sales. VW thought the program would be successful because 60 percent of Beetle owners are frequent computer users, said Elisabeth Vanzura, marketing director for VW of America. ''We intend to be a leader in this area,'' Mrs. Vanzura said.</p>
        <p>The potential ease appealed to me, and I did not feel a need to visit a showroom because I was familiar with the car. Logging onto VW's Web site (www.vw.com) on May 4, the first day the cars were available, I selected Vapor Blue, picked the engine, chose leather seats and a trim package that included a sunroof.</p>
        <p>My first choice -- with the latest engine, a turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder -- was not available. So instead, I selected a car with a 2-liter conventional gas engine and completed the transaction.</p>
        <p>My order was immediately sent to Howard Cooper Volkswagen here. The entire process took 17 minutes. I immediately received an e-mail message that said: ''Congratulations. You are well on your way to owning a Limited Edition New Beetle.'' The note told me I now had my own home page on www.myvw.com, complete with an e-mail account that would allow me to discuss terms with my dealer. It promised I would hear from someone within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Five hours later, Cooper Volkswagen's Internet sales manager, David McCoy, rang my cellular phone. He was ready to take a deposit of $500 and offered to let me use a credit card.</p>
        <p>But I decided that I really wanted the turbo. Mr. McCoy said he could not guarantee he could get me that car because only VW, not dealers, controlled the inventory. But later that afternoon, he fired off an e-mail telling me that a Vapor Blue 1.8T had been found and would be shipped to Michigan.</p>
        <p>Two weeks of e-mail exchanges followed. I did not meet Mr. McCoy or set foot in the dealership until May 22, when I went to pick up my car. But through our electronic communications, I knew the car's identification number; the seaport (Wilmington, Del.) where it had arrived from VW's factory in Puebla, Mexico; the date it was due in Ann Arbor; the price ($21,900 before taxes and other fees); and various financing options.</p>
        <p>Because my car was a limited-edition model, there was no negotiating. I paid the list price, in cash received from the Promersbergers for my old car along with proceeds from a badly performing mutual fund.</p>
        <p>While Mr. McClure said he also could have paid cash, he decided to finance his purchase, and sought alternatives via the Internet. He spent four minutes completing a form at www.lendingtree.com, which matches lenders with buyers.</p>
        <p>Quickly, he had four responses. ''I had never heard of these people, and they had never heard of me,'' he said. ''But within two hours, they were willing to loan me $35,000.'' He dismissed two loan offers, at interest rates of 9.25 and 8 percent, as too high. Two other banks offered loans at 7.25 and 7.7 percent. The bank with the higher rate agreed to match the lower one. Within a few days, he received a check, made out to him and the Mercedes dealership, which he took to the showroom to redeem and pick up his vehicle. Mr. McClure also shopped on the Internet for insurance.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClure dealt with the same salesman throughout his transaction. At Howard Cooper, I was handed off by Mr. McCoy, the Internet specialist, to a salesman, Ed Goldman. Completing the deal took about two hours. In that time, Mr. Goldman verified my insurance, accepted my personal check, explained the warranty and the owner's manual in detail, and then gave me a tutorial on the Beetle's features.</p>
        <p>My car was literally under wraps in a garage behind the showroom, hidden away so that window shoppers wouldn't get the impression that they could buy a similar car from inventory.</p>
        <p>The special handling did not end there. Members of the sales staff, as well as the general manager, came out to look at the Vapor Blue car and to congratulate me. I felt vaguely like a bride when, in a final touch, Mr. Goldman handed me a bouquet of daisies, cut to fit the dashboard bud vase, which is tinted the same color as the car.</p>
        <p>The Vapor Blue Beetles were virtually sold out by June, but sales of the Reflex Yellow models lagged; some of these have been sent to dealers. Tony Fouladpour, VW's press relations manager, said yellow cars tend to appeal to people with outgoing personalities, perhaps at odds with those who spend hours surfing the Internet.</p>
        <p>Asked whether Volkswagen will use the Web again to sell special models, Mr. Fouladpour replied, ''Absolutely.'' A future customer could be Mr. McClure. ''I'm going to do it forever this way,'' he said.</p>
