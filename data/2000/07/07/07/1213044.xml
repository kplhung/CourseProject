        <p>Online Business Exchanges May Raise Antitrust Issues  As companies in nearly every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.</p>
        <p>The exchanges create a place for companies in the same industry to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars. But the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust experts say.

        <p>Online Business Exchanges May Raise Antitrust Issues  As companies in nearly every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.</p>
        <p>The exchanges create a place for companies in the same industry to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars. But the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust experts say.

        <p>Retailers Post Anemic Sales Rise  Sales in stores open more than a year, a key figure for measuring the health of the retail industry, rose by only 2.6 percent in June compared with figures in the period a year earlier. Analysts said the numbers were in line with expectations that the economy is losing steam. Consumers are spending less at all types of stores, ranging from specialty apparel stores like the Gap to discount stores like Kmart. [C16.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Rise in Technology Rebound  Stocks closed mostly higher as Wall Street looked for bargains in technology shares that were battered in the previous session. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 97.47 points, or 2.5 percent, to 3,960.57. The Dow Jones industrial average edged down 2.13 points, or 0.02 percent, to 10,481.47, cushioned by gains in Intel and financial stocks. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index finished up 10.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,456.67. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 6.04 percent from 5.98 percent. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Amtrak to Offer Riders Free Trips  Amtrak said that it would offer every dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip, even if the problem was not its fault. The new program is part of Amtrak's campaign to build ridership and revenue by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers before Congress cuts off operating subsidies in 2003. [A14.]</p>
        <p>SBC to Start Long Distance in Texas  SBC Communications plans to formally announce today the long-distance rates it will charge in Texas, the second state after New York in which a local phone company will also offer long-distance service. SBC will charge a basic rate of 9 cents a minute for in-state and out-of-state calls anytime, with no monthly fee. It will also cater some services to people who make frequent calls to Mexico.

        <p>Gtech Warns on Profit; Chief Quits  Gtech Holdings said that its two top executives had resigned and that its revenue and earnings would fall short of expectations. The lottery company said the departures of William Y. O'Connor, chairman and chief executive, and Stephen P. Nowick, president and chief financial officer, were a result of the board's dissatisfaction with the unexpected announcement, Gtech's lagging stock price and the poor handling of a computer flaw in Britain's national lottery that recently came to light. Shares of Gtech fell $2.9375, to $19.8125. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Factory Orders Rose 4.1% in May  Factory orders rose 4.1 percent in May, the largest gain in almost seven and a half years, suggesting that signs of a slowdown in consumer demand are having only a limited effect on manufacturers, a report showed. A separate report showed claims for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in five weeks. [C2.]</p>
        <p>MTV Comedian to Pitch Right Guard  Tom Green, the outrageous MTV comedian best known for stunts like dropping a live mouse into his mouth, as he does in the hit comedy film ''Road Trip,'' or snorkeling for change in a shopping mall fountain, is being featured by Gillette in a television and print campaign for Right Guard. Advertising. [C3.]</p>
