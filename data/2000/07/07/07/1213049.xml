        <p>The police were searching yesterday for a man who fatally stabbed a Guyanese immigrant during a parking dispute as the victim was taking his family out for a Fourth of July dinner.</p>
        <p>The man, Vishwanath Jadunath, known as Anthony, was taking his wife, 2-year-old daughter and other relatives out to a West Indian restaurant in Hollis, Queens, when he pulled into a parking lot near the restaurant on Hillside Avenue around 9 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
        <p>There, Mr. Jadunath encountered a man who had been sitting with a female companion and a toddler on a curb at the edge of the parking space, waiting for a bus. The man accused Mr. Jadunath of nearly running over the child and began cursing at him, said Mr. Jadunath's wife, Anita Lachman, 21. The argument escalated, and the man stabbed Mr. Jadunath once in the chest, the police and witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jadunath, who lived in Queens Village, was taken to Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica, where he died, the police said. They were looking for the attacker yesterday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lachman said that her husband and the attacker had argued briefly. Mr. Jadunath told the man, ''I have children, too,'' and added that he did not intend to harm the child, she said. But the dispute quickly escalated, and the man pulled out a knife and stabbed Mr. Jadunath before fleeing, Ms. Lachman said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lachman's sister, Sandra Lachman, who also saw the stabbing, said the man's companion fled separately and dropped a bag containing a photograph of herself that the police recovered. She said the police showed her and her sister the photograph, and they identified the woman as the attacker's companion.</p>
        <p>But the police still had no suspects yesterday, as Mr. Jadunath's family gathered at his home on 217th Street.</p>
        <p>''I just feel like New York has run out of space,'' said Chris Charran, Mr. Jadunath's uncle. ''People trigger off so easily.''</p>
        <p>With her 2-year-old and her other daughter, age 1, on her lap, Ms. Lachman sobbed as she recalled talking to her husband in the parking lot after the stabbing.</p>
        <p>''He couldn't say a word,'' she said. ''I just held him in my hands. I told him I love him and I need him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jadunath, who had celebrated his 23rd birthday on Sunday, was a construction worker. He immigrated from Guyana in 1987. He was studying computer networking in a part-time program at LaGuardia Community College, his family said.</p>
