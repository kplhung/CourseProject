        <p>The sunbaked afternoon at Yankee Stadium quickly turned into a pitching barbecue. The left-hander Ed Yarnall, called up from Columbus for yesterday's start, gave up five runs in the first two innings on just 42 pitches. By the time the rookie reliever Ben Ford stumbled out of the second inning, the Yankees were trailing, 7-0, to the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>No matter. When the second inning finally ended, 1 hour 11 minutes after the first pitch of the game, the Yankees led, 8-7, feasting on the four straight walks from the Orioles' starter, Sidney Ponson, and getting a lift once again from Bernie Williams, who extended his hitting streak to 16 games.</p>

        <p>The sunbaked afternoon at Yankee Stadium quickly turned into a pitching barbecue. The left-hander Ed Yarnall, called up from Columbus for yesterday's start, gave up five runs in the first two innings on just 42 pitches. By the time the rookie reliever Ben Ford stumbled out of the second inning, the Yankees were trailing, 7-0, to the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>No matter. When the second inning finally ended, 1 hour 11 minutes after the first pitch of the game, the Yankees led, 8-7, feasting on the four straight walks from the Orioles' starter, Sidney Ponson, and getting a lift once again from Bernie Williams, who extended his hitting streak to 16 games.</p>
        <p>The Yankees then scored five more runs in the fourth inning and rode out a 13-9 victory over the Orioles.</p>
        <p>But while the Yankees storm into Shea Stadium for tonight's series opener against the Mets, having won four of five games, yesterday's game showed that not even a fuel-injected offense can hide the noise of a flat tire rumbling in their rotation.</p>
        <p>The Yankees devised two temporary plans to fix it. Before the game, Manager Joe Torre announced that he was placing a fragile and struggling David Cone in the bullpen for safekeeping for the four-game Mets series, moving up the Yankees' best pitcher, Andy Pettitte, into what would have been Cone's start Sunday night at Shea.</p>
        <p>And after the game, Torre dropped the bombshell that the Yankees were calling up the 35-year-old Dwight Gooden from the rookie league minors to pitch tomorrow against the Mets, marking the first time that Gooden will pitch against the team on which he became famous.</p>
        <p>''If there's ever going to be an adrenaline flow, I don't think there's going to be a problem getting up for the game,'' Torre said of Gooden's return to Shea Stadium for the first time since 1994. ''It's familiar grounds to him, and hopefully it works on our behalf.''</p>
        <p>Still, in talking about Gooden, Torre did not sound particularly enthusiastic or comfortable. Gooden pitched for Torre and the Yankees in 1996 and 1997, and after the Yankees then let him go, Gooden took a swipe at the way Torre had used him. Now Gooden is back, after a quick stint in the minor leagues.</p>
        <p>''Doc was recommended to us from down below and you have to go on their recommendations, and we need a starter for Saturday after last night and today,'' Torre said. The Yankees beat the Orioles, 12-6, Wednesday after building a 10-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The struggling Ford was no longer considered a viable option for a start tomorrow. Nor was Jason Grimsley, who pitched in relief yesterday and Wednesday night, giving up two runs in each outing. The rookie Jake Westbrook, who had two horrendous outings last month, was unavailable because of a strained rib cage.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were out of alternatives, General Manager Brian Cashman said. So they turned to Gooden, who has not pitched a major league game in more than two months. He started the year with Houston and was later picked up by Tampa Bay. Over all, he has a 2-3 record this season, with a 6.86 earned run average.</p>
        <p>Gooden has thrown 12 strikeouts in two outings with the Yankees' Gulf Coast League team in Florida since being acquired last month. He has been tinkering with a new pitch, a cutter, to good results.</p>
        <p>''He's the best choice,'' Cashman said. For now. ''I'm just hoping for a good start,'' the general manager added.</p>
        <p>So is Torre, who described himself as ''a guy who isn't as comfortable as he wants to be with our pitching.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Yarnall showed his inexperience and nervousness within the first minute, giving up a leadoff home run to Brady Anderson. It was an omen for a long afternoon. ''I was struggling to get ahead of guys,'' he said. ''I was worried too much about my stuff, and when you do that, it unravels.''</p>
        <p>But despite trailing, 7-0, after an inning and a half, the Yankees did not unravel.</p>
        <p>''I think all of us had a sense that we could still win the game,'' Scott Brosius said. ''We didn't expect to put all eight up there in one inning. But it seemed like it was one of those days where there was so much time left.''</p>
        <p>The big inning began inauspiciously, with Williams getting an infield single on a ball that second baseman Mark Lewis didn't field cleanly. Ponson then proceeded to crumble in startling fashion, walking David Justice, Tino Martinez, Jorge Posada and Brosius in succession to force in two runs and leave the bases loaded. A groundout by Jose Vizcaino scored one more run, and a single by Chuck Knoblauch scored another to make the score 7-4.</p>
        <p>Orioles Manager Mike Hargrove then called for the right-hander Jason Johnson, who is now 0-8 on the year, and he did nothing to disprove his statistics. He promptly gave up a three-run homer to Derek Jeter, the first batter he faced, that tied the score at 7-7. Then Paul O'Neill swung at the next pitch and deposited it in the seats for an 8-7 lead.</p>
        <p>For a moment, that lead did not appear safe. Mike Stanton started the third inning and threw six pitches before managing to get a strike across the plate. The crowd of 44,104 cheered when Stanton got Luis Matos looking for the game's first strikeout, 74 minutes after the first pitch.</p>
        <p>When Stanton left, three and two-thirds innings later, he had allowed no runs on just one hit. ''I knew I had to come in and stop the bleeding,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees piled on more runs in the fourth, and they would need them. Williams hit his 19th home run, a two-run, opposite-field shot to left that put the Yankees up, 12-7. Even Justice, who had had just two hits at the plate in six games since becoming a Yankee, contributed, logging his first home run as a Yankee and his 22nd of the season.</p>
        <p>This offense exploded against the second-worst pitching staff in the American League. But can the hitters continue to shore up a team that has just three definite starters for now -- Orlando Hernandez, Roger Clemens and Pettitte?</p>
        <p>Help could come from Ramiro Mendoza, who is scheduled to come off the disabled list on Monday, and ultimately from Cone.</p>
        <p>As for Gooden, nobody knows what to expect. His former teammates seemed energized about his return, but O'Neill summarized it best, saying, ''Hey, I'm fired up for anybody to pitch for us right now.''</p>
