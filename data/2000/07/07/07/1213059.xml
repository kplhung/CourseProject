        <p>''It's a subway series -- you gotta take the train,'' Tom Milan was saying with such an adamant certainty that his buddies at the bar just had to disagree.</p>
        <p>''No, you don't,'' said one of them, Jerry Beyrer, putting his beer momentarily aside. ''You don't take the train at all. You get a nylon jacket, print 'security' in orange on the back and you sneak on the team bus. That's what you do.''</p>
        <p>Manny Feliu, sitting next to Mr. Beyrer at the Yankee Tavern on Wednesday night, saw it even differently. ''You stay at home,'' he said, swirling his gin with quiet authority. ''You click the remote from station to station, then you relax. Trust me, it's the quickest trip you'll ever take.''</p>
        <p>Such was some of the chatter among the city's baseball fans this week as they sought to unravel a truly unusual sports conundrum. With the Mets and Yankees poised to play a split-park doubleheader tomorrow -- an event that has not taken place for almost a century -- how much chaos would ensue as legions of fans (not to mention two entire Major League ball clubs) traveled between the two games, from Shea Stadium in northern Queens to Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx?</p>
        <p>The games on Saturday -- the first at Shea at 1:15 p.m., the second at Yankee Stadium at 8:05 p.m. -- promise to be a movable feast of baseball. They also promise to be part sports novelty, part transit brain-teaser and, of course, an all-out example of New York City excess as police escorts accompany both teams along what is likely to be the chosen route: down the Grand Central Parkway, over the Triborough Bridge and up the Major Deegan Expressway.</p>
        <p>The split-park two-fer, the result of a rain cancellation at Yankee Stadium on June 11, also brings with it a host of logistical headaches. Subway motormen will have to brace themselves for beery cheering and perhaps some nastiness among desegregated fans. The fans will have to manage some quick commuting calculus, faced with the choices of strap-hanging, highway driving or canoeing through Flushing Bay past Rikers Island to get from park to park.</p>
        <p>Even Charlie Samuels, the Mets' equipment manager, has acknowledged having a minor crisis to avert: he and his staff must wash and dry a roster's worth of dirty underwear in the interlude between the games.</p>
        <p>''Maybe in years to come, to look back and say, yeah, in the year 2000 we had a day in which we played two games in two separate parks, it might be something to talk about,'' said Al Leiter, one of the Mets' starting pitchers, sounding decidedly unconvinced. ''But Saturday, for the most part, guys are going to view it as an inconvenience.''</p>
        <p>The last time that two big league ball clubs played a day game in one park then decamped for a later game in another was on Sept. 7, 1903, when the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Superbas (later to become the Dodgers) faced off twice, winning one game each. The first game was played before 9,300 fans in Washington Park in Brooklyn, which predated Ebbets Field; the second was played before a crowd of more than 23,000 at the Polo Grounds in Harlem.</p>
        <p>While there were no reports in the newspapers of the day on how the teams and their retinues traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan, one thing is sure: They did not ride the subway or cross the Triborough Bridge. Neither existed at the time.</p>
        <p>To prepare for the possibility of an entire baseball stadium -- even a third of a baseball stadium -- picking up their plastic cups and felt pennants and riding the rails in an interborough swarm to yet another baseball stadium, city transit officials have added seven subway trains to each of the three lines that are expected to be hit: the 7, the 4 and the D, which also goes to Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''We've added service on each of those lines separately for big, sold-out games in the past, but this will be the first time we've had to beef them all up at once,'' said Bob Slovak, a spokesman for New York City Transit. ''Of course, we're certainly happy to do it for our customers, be they Yankee fans or Met fans.''</p>
        <p>But Mike Pettinato, a conductor on the 7 line, had a less diplomatic view of what would happen on the subways between games. ''As soon as the Mets fan hit the Bronx,'' he said, ''the Yankee fans are going to set them on fire. They're going drop some gasoline on them and light a match.''</p>
        <p>The two teams, which are both in second place in their divisions, plan to handle the intermission in a somewhat similar fashion, spending as much time as possible between the games at their own home field. The Yankees plan to depart Shea Stadium immediately after the first game. The Mets will depart from Queens much later, around 6:45 p.m.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees manager, said he, at least, was unconcerned about the traffic. ''That's why we have a police escort,'' he said. ''We can just have all the fans follow us and we'll E-ZPass them through.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the authorities have taken the situation seriously. The police said that each team had been escorted through the city separately in the past but that they had never received such treatment on the same day.</p>
        <p>''We're going to be busy,'' said Detective Walter Burnes, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>One potential kink, given baseball's inherently lax attitude toward time, is what happens if the first game at Shea runs into extra innings? Would the teams wind up on the road together, traveling in a single Bronx-bound convoy?</p>
        <p>Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said he was confident that there was enough time between the games to avert a joint Mets-Yankees road trip. ''Obviously, the record is 26 innings, and if it goes 26 innings we might be in trouble,'' he said. ''But we're expecting everything to be fine.''</p>
        <p>Based on an unscientific survey (asking around on the Yankees and Mets Internet bulletin boards), most fans lucky enough to have tickets to both games seem to be leaning toward the subway as their mode of transportation. The 7 train from Flushing to Grand Central. Switch. Head over to the 4 train to the Bronx.</p>
        <p>In fact, The New York Mercantile Exchange has agreed to assist in the commute by giving a Metrocard with a single one-way fare to the first 3,000 fans who can produce a set of tickets to both games.</p>
        <p>But even with such enticements, the Yankee Tavern was still filled with hot debate.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's going to be doing the dumbest thing they can, like riding a bike,'' said Mr. Feliu, who once more advocated staying home. ''We all know what New Yorkers are like.''</p>
        <p>''But you could probably catch a good fight or two on the train,'' Mr. Milan offered.</p>
        <p>That was when Joe Bastone, the owner of the bar, chimed in. ''You know what I would do if I was going,'' he said. ''Park the car at Yankee Stadium. Take the train over to Shea. Then come back to the Bronx by train. And then drive home.''</p>
        <p>For a moment, the pub fell into silence. It looked as if the answer had finally been found. But then the barmaid, Natalie Grigas, had to chip in with her two cents.</p>
        <p>''If it was me,'' she said, polishing a pint glass with a rag. ''I'd hitchhike.''</p>
