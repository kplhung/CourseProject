        <p>There is a go-for-broke quality to the Israeli and American approach to the coming Camp David summit meeting, which starts on Tuesday with the stated goal of ending a 52-year-old, blood-steeped conflict.</p>
        <p>But for the Palestinians, whose participation is more reluctant, there is at best an aspiration that the three-way meeting will serve as a stopgap to keep alive the stalemated peace effort so that a partial deal can be achieved by September.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak will arrive in Maryland as a weakened Israeli leader with one thing on his mind: to push the peace effort with the Palestinians to a conclusion before he loses his grip on power. Battered by the right over his peace moves and by the left over his concessions to the religious parties, he will try to rise above the partisan politics that, with two parties poised to quit his coalition, is about to cost him his parliamentary majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak will seek to forge the framework of a final peace deal with the Palestinians on the basis of what he considers a directive from the Israeli people, who overwhelming elected him last year on a platform of peacemaking. And if he fails, he said today, he will have given it his best effort in the face of a potential for the conflict to disintegrate ''into Belfast or Bosnia.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, President Clinton appears to have decided that he cannot make things worse by forcing the parties into an endgame, since no summit meeting and a failed summit meeting have the same potential outcome: violence. If the chemistry of the moment produces a breakthrough, the accomplishment is substantial. If not, the risk to the American president is minimal.</p>
        <p>But the Palestinians' leader, Yasir Arafat, whose lifelong struggle rests on this effort, will approach Camp David far more skeptically and cautiously than the other two leaders. He will take part against the counsel of his senior advisers, who think the groundwork has not been laid for a compromise on any major issue.</p>
        <p>Of mixed mind, Mr. Arafat is saying that he is going only because he cannot refuse an invitation from President Clinton. But he is also betting that if negotiations are to work, he stands to gain the most at a high-stakes summit meeting presided over by this American president, with whom he has forged a bond.  Weighing the alternative -- a unilateral declaration of statehood, which is bound to be accompanied by violence, an Israeli annexation of West Bank land and complications for Mr. Arafat's international acceptance -- he is willing to gamble.</p>
        <p>Like Anwar el-Sadat, before the last Middle East peace gathering at Camp David, in 1978, Mr. Arafat needs to deliver some kind of victory to his people, weary of bloodshed.</p>
        <p>Having proclaimed and disclaimed previous deadlines for establishing a state, Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian leadership this week tied the Palestinian fate to a new one, Sept. 13. This one will be harder to ignore if he is to retain his credibility; it marks the formal end of the interim peacemaking period, which was extended from May 4, 1999.</p>
        <p>But the chief economic adviser to Mr. Arafat, Mohammed Rachid, said tonight that the Palestinians would willingly bypass the deadline if they were engaged in serious negotiations. And many experts think the Palestinian people, who would prefer a real state to a nominal one, could be persuaded to endure another postponement if they saw any tangible progress, like a substantial transfer of West Bank land.</p>
        <p>''The people are pragmatic and they'll accept a bird in the hand,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst. ''There is a growing minority that rejects the peace process, but it is not a majority, and there is no alternative. There is no other game.''</p>
        <p>A cartoon in the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds today showed the spirit of the meeting as a whirlwind blowing out the candle of the Palestinian declaration of independence.</p>
        <p>Israeli military analysts paint a different picture. In a briefing for foreign reporters today, a senior military officer in the West Bank said Mr. Arafat had introduced a ''struggle consciousness'' to accompany the negotiations. He said Mr. Arafat wants to achieve independence ''through friction and blood.''</p>
        <p>''The rules of the game are low-intensity conflict accompanying the diplomatic process with the threat of terrorism in the background,'' the senior officer said. ''Arafat wants to appear as both the pyromaniac and the fireman.''</p>
        <p>One could be whipsawed by the surface contradictions here today between the bounding optimism of Israeli doves and the thick skepticism of Palestinian officials.</p>
        <p>Leaving a meeting with Mr. Arafat in Gaza City, Yossi Beilin, Israel's justice minister, expressed unconditional faith in the eventuality of a peace deal. ''I don't believe that all the leaders will go to Camp David and come back empty-handed,'' he said. ''We are going to make peace. And after all these years, we will have to compromise, both sides, to find solutions and come back home and tell our kids that they will not have to take part in the wars we took part in.''</p>
        <p>In contrast, Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature and a senior negotiator, said he does not think the summit meeting will achieve any of its aims. ''It is clear that Barak is trying to escape from negotiations and jump to a summit because he thinks he can force deals,'' he said. ''But if he thinks that he can give us some land on which to declare a Palestinian state and then we will forget the other issues, then he's living in a dream world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachid, a relatively unideological and pragmatic adviser, spoke more practically about what could be achieved. He said that, in Israeli style and on an Israeli scale, the Palestinians would ask the Americans for $40 billion in aid to accompany a peace treaty. Most of that would go toward refugee aid, he said.</p>
        <p>He also that the Israelis were overly focused on the percentage of the West Bank they would transfer to the Palestinians. He noted that Mr. Barak, who started out talking about turning over 50 percent of the land, had increased his offer most recently to 88 percent -- 78 percent now and 10 percent over time. But Mr. Rachid said the Palestinians wanted the Israelis to stop thinking of it as their land to give away and to start accepting the principle that the Palestinians have a rightful claim to the West Bank. That, he suggested, would make the Palestinians more flexible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is unlikely to travel to Washington with his most hard-line ministers because they are expected to quit before he leaves. Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who leads a small Russian immigrant party, has said he will tender his resignation on Sunday, and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, who leads the National Religious Party, is prepared to step down too. Eli Yishai, leader of the rigorously Orthodox Shas Party, is undecided about whether he will travel with the prime minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak is expected to be accompanied by a delegation including Foreign Minister David Levy, Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben Ami, and Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein and his security advisers. Mr. Arafat's delegation will include Mr. Abu Ala, Mr. Rachid, the senior negotiators Abu Mazen and Saeb Erekat, and Mohammed Dahlan, a security chief.</p>
