        <p>Editorial says United States should do all that it can to support efforts of Pres-Elect Vicente Fox Quesada to transform Mexico from an autocracy based on patronage and privilege into a law-abiding, pluralistic democracy</p>

        <p>Mexicans have understandably high expectations for Vicente Fox Quesada, the man they elected to break the 71-year presidential monopoly of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. In the euphoria that has followed his decisive victory Sunday, they now look to Mr. Fox to eliminate the official corruption, economic inequalities and political repression that were the defining characteristics of PRI rule. Mr. Fox's initial declarations are promising. But he will need persistence and cooperation from Mexico's other parties to succeed.</p>
        <p>Taking over from an entrenched autocracy is never easy, and Mr. Fox faces more than the usual difficulties. The PRI remains in power for five more months, long enough to destroy records of corrupt dealings and deny Mr. Fox a smooth transition. His party will lack a Congressional majority, requiring him to make deals with other political forces, including the PRI. President Ernesto Zedillo should make sure that the current government shares information fully with Mr. Fox's nominees.</p>

        <p>Mexicans have understandably high expectations for Vicente Fox Quesada, the man they elected to break the 71-year presidential monopoly of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. In the euphoria that has followed his decisive victory Sunday, they now look to Mr. Fox to eliminate the official corruption, economic inequalities and political repression that were the defining characteristics of PRI rule. Mr. Fox's initial declarations are promising. But he will need persistence and cooperation from Mexico's other parties to succeed.</p>
        <p>Taking over from an entrenched autocracy is never easy, and Mr. Fox faces more than the usual difficulties. The PRI remains in power for five more months, long enough to destroy records of corrupt dealings and deny Mr. Fox a smooth transition. His party will lack a Congressional majority, requiring him to make deals with other political forces, including the PRI. President Ernesto Zedillo should make sure that the current government shares information fully with Mr. Fox's nominees.</p>
        <p>The most important issue facing Mr. Fox is government corruption. He has promised to remove police functions from the highly politicized Interior Ministry and the attorney general's office and establish a new, more professional ministry of security and justice. Those are necessary steps. Mexico's police have become notorious for protecting drug dealers and preying on ordinary citizens while facing little threat of investigation or punishment. But merely creating a new ministry is not enough. The training and management of police and prosecutors must be overhauled to ensure that criminal investigations are conducted properly and all law enforcement officers are held accountable for misconduct.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has also pledged to channel public resources toward reducing poverty and to bring the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement to smaller businesses. Washington should offer him strong support. A Mexico with economic opportunity more widely distributed among its 100 million people would not only provide a better market for American consumer goods, it would also be a more comfortable economic and political partner for the United States. Washington should consider Mr. Fox's sensible ideas about expanding legal immigration.</p>
        <p>Mexico's size, proximity and prominence as a trade partner tie it inextricably to the United States. Washington should do all that it can to support Mr. Fox's efforts to transform his country from an autocracy based on patronage and privilege into a law-abiding, pluralist democracy.</p>
