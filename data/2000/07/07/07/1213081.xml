        <p>A Brooklyn councilwoman apologized yesterday for suggesting that New York city police officers, had they been out of uniform, might have participated in the Central Park sex attacks.</p>
        <p>In a statement faxed to news organizations throughout the city, Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson, Democrat of Bedford-Stuyvesant, expressed regret for her remarks and ''any harm that they caused to the men and women of the N.Y.P.D.'' She said she would continue to work cooperatively with the department, which she criticized on Wednesday for what she described as an inadequate response to the attacks and an inadequate investigation afterward.</p>

        <p>A Brooklyn councilwoman apologized yesterday for suggesting that New York city police officers, had they been out of uniform, might have participated in the Central Park sex attacks.</p>
        <p>In a statement faxed to news organizations throughout the city, Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson, Democrat of Bedford-Stuyvesant, expressed regret for her remarks and ''any harm that they caused to the men and women of the N.Y.P.D.'' She said she would continue to work cooperatively with the department, which she criticized on Wednesday for what she described as an inadequate response to the attacks and an inadequate investigation afterward.</p>
        <p>''I had intended to express the frustration felt by many of my constituents over the lack of training and maturity exhibited by some members of the department,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''I had also wanted to convey the frustration over the dismissive response of some officials when offensive and criminal acts are committed against women.''</p>
        <p>As news of the apology circulated at One Police Plaza, Police Commissioner Howard Safir seemed unimpressed and said that Ms. Robinson should surrender her seat on a nine-member City Council panel that has been seeking a way to improve relations between citizens and the police. The panel was formed this year after four officers were acquitted in the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo. Ms. Robinson is its chairwoman.</p>
        <p>''We understand Councilmember Robinson's apology,'' Mr. Safir said. ''However, if she is truly interested in apologizing, she should resign her position on the Council's Select Committee on Police Performance and Community Relations, as she has clearly demonstrated her prejudice against the police and her inability to be objective.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Robinson could not be reached by telephone for comment yesterday. But upon hearing of Mr. Safir's remarks, Carrie Mobley, the councilwoman's chief of staff, said, ''Yeah, right.'' She would not elaborate.</p>
        <p>The sometimes angry exchange between the department and critics of its handling of the Central Park attacks continued yesterday. Anne Peyton Bryant, one of 59 women who have reported being attacked after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, held a news conference at which she said the police investigation to date was unsatisfactory.</p>
        <p>Speaking through tears at times, Ms. Bryant and her lawyer said the department operated ''the biggest spin machine in the city'' and had not done enough to identify police officers who refused to help her after she was attacked on June 11.</p>
