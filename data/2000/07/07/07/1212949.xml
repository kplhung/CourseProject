      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The digging is over at March, which closed on Easter and reopened last week at twice the size. Most of the new space has gone to the staff. Diners won't see it, but the kitchen and the storage areas are a lot bigger. What they will see, after walking through the familiar, still narrow front dining room is an addition at the rear with two new dining areas, raising the number of seats to 88 from 50.</p>
        <p>The first question then is, upstairs or downstairs? Downstairs, where the garden used to be, is a small room illuminated by a slanting skylight. Wayne Nish, the chef and owner of March, and his architect, John Kinnear, have buffered the shock of the new by laying down the Persian carpets from the old March and hanging the French tapestry that once was in the rear dining room. The Bauhaus upholstery by Walter Gropius also remains, in a fresh edition, and Mr. Nish has put up some 17th-century botanical prints he found in Venice. On the mezzanine, four tables overlook the main room.</p>

        <p>The digging is over at March, which closed on Easter and reopened last week at twice the size. Most of the new space has gone to the staff. Diners won't see it, but the kitchen and the storage areas are a lot bigger. What they will see, after walking through the familiar, still narrow front dining room is an addition at the rear with two new dining areas, raising the number of seats to 88 from 50.</p>
        <p>The first question then is, upstairs or downstairs? Downstairs, where the garden used to be, is a small room illuminated by a slanting skylight. Wayne Nish, the chef and owner of March, and his architect, John Kinnear, have buffered the shock of the new by laying down the Persian carpets from the old March and hanging the French tapestry that once was in the rear dining room. The Bauhaus upholstery by Walter Gropius also remains, in a fresh edition, and Mr. Nish has put up some 17th-century botanical prints he found in Venice. On the mezzanine, four tables overlook the main room.</p>
        <p>March still feels like March, and the menu does, too, although Mr. Nish has changed the format slightly, adding two choices to the fixed-price format.</p>
        <p>In addition to the four-course and seven-course options, diners may order five or six courses. As before, the menus come in two prices, with or without wines matched to each course.</p>
        <p>There are no categories on the menu, which starts with appetizer-like dishes and simply progresses through fish, fowl and red meats. A four-course dinner might go like this: first course, carpaccio of lobster with three roes (osetra, mentaiko and uni); second course, diver scallops with butternut squash and apple puree and Japanese horseradish sauce; third course, confit of Long Island duck and grilled duck breast with celery root and port wine sauce. Other dishes include cardomom-accented ravioli of sweet garlic and baby leeks; soft-shell crab tempura with corn jus and black truffle puree; or braised and sauteed squab with spaghetti squash and foie gras sauce.</p>
        <p>Dessert comes in threes. Stacie Pierce, March's new pastry chef, has devised a menu that plays fascinating variations on American and French classics.</p>
        <p>The list includes butterscotch pot de creme with creme fraiche and ginger snaps, upside down sour cream cake with blueberries and buttermilk ice cream, and baked alaska with espresso ice cream, chocolate souffle cake and toasted almonds. At March, of course, Asia is never far away. The warm-up for the main desserts is a palate-tingling chilled Chinese jelly flavored with Japanese apple pectin and fragrant Chinese wine.</p>
        <p>March, 405 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 754-6272.</p>
        <p>At dinner, the fixed-price menus range from $72 for four courses ($112 with matching wines) to $126 for seven courses ($196 with matching wines).</p>
