        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made a point of keeping his four young children out of the news, was embarrassed today by front-page headlines reporting the arrest of his 16-year-old son, Euan, for drunkenness Wednesday night in downtown London.</p>
        <p>The incident took place days after Mr. Blair called for stricter measures to be taken against pub rioters and drunken soccer hooligans. The police said they had arrested Euan because they were concerned about his state.</p>
        <p>The young man was found by the police on the pavement in Leicester Square at 11 p.m. after he vomited and collapsed on an outing with friends celebrating the end of exams. He was taken to Charing Cross police station where he gave a false name before his identity was discovered and officers from 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, were sent to bring him  home.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister's office issued a statement saying in part: ''Euan is very sorry for the inconvenience he caused to the police, the state he was in, and for the false statement he made. He is in no doubt of the seriousness of it and the view that his parents take of it.''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Mr. Blair interrupted a speech to a convention in Brighton to say: ''Well, being a prime minister can be a tough job, but I always think being a parent is probably tougher. Sometimes you don't always succeed, but the family to me is more important than anything else.''</p>
