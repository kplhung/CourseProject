        <p>With 53,000 people in a prison system built for fewer than 43,000, Italy now has its largest prison population since the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>Ever since members of the governing center-left coalition last month began gingerly discussing easing conditions by freeing thousands of prisoners under a general pardon or amnesty, prisons across Italy have erupted in disturbances and protests, with prisoners -- and sometimes the guards -- conducting strikes, burning mattresses and going on hunger strikes.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from inmates, guards and Pope John Paul II, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to examine five draft proposals to free prisoners.</p>
        <p>The pope, who intends to visit a Roman prison on Sunday on a Holy Year day dedicated to prisoners, last week asked governments worldwide for leniency toward inmates, saying, ''A reduction, even a modest one, of the term of punishment would be for prisoners a clear sign of sensitivity to their condition.'' The Vatican has helped raise the expectations of Italian inmates and put pressure on politicians, who are uncomfortable with a step that a majority of Italians oppose.</p>
        <p>The center-right opposition, led by Silvio Berlusconi, the media baron, has rejected suggestions that Parliament approve a general pardon to ease prison conditions.</p>
        <p>The opposition argues that the entire justice system needs a rehauling and that dangerous criminals could be freed. Italians generally have little faith in the judicial system, but they are also increasingly concerned about crime. Polls suggest that most Italians oppose an amnesty or pardon.</p>
        <p>The lower house of Parliament has 20 proposals, and the Senate has 5.</p>
        <p>The government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato has not issued its own bill. Instead, politicians have floated proposals.</p>
        <p>With national elections expected to be held in a year, the battle has many layers beneath the pros and cons raised in public debate. Mr. Berlusconi had a private meeting with Justice Minister Piero Fassino last week on the issue. Afterward, Mr. Berlusconi rejected the notion of a general pardon.</p>
        <p>Usually, a general pardon would release prisoners who have less than three years remaining on their sentences.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berlusconi did not rule out an amnesty, which would release prisoners under certain conditions, expunge their records and also wipe out certain trials in progress. Some legal experts argue that an amnesty would help unclog the backlog of court cases and be more effective than a general pardon.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berlusconi, who has had several convictions of accounting fraud and bribery and who has been acquitted on appeal of several convictions of accounting fraud and bribery, faces trials on other charges of false accounting and could benefit personally -- and politically -- from an amnesty.</p>
        <p>That has led center-left politicians to make sarcastic remarks about Mr. Berlusconi's personal motives, as well as pious remarks about the center-right opposition's failure to heed the pope's pleas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amato's center-left coalition is deeply divided and in disarray, however. Many political experts and even members of his coalition suspect that the Amato government could end up reaching an agreement with the opposition to grant an amnesty, hoping to avert a confidence vote that could force early elections, which the center-left fears it would lose in its present frazzled state.</p>
