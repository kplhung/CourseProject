        <p>Amtrak said today that it would offer every dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip, even if the problem was not its fault.</p>
        <p>The program is part of a campaign to build ridership and revenue by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers before Congress ends operating subsidies in 2003.</p>
        <p>''This grabs people's attention in the marketplace,'' said George Warrington, president of Amtrak, who added that none of Amtrak's competitors, including the airlines, had offered a similar program. The new program is retroactive to July 4.</p>
        <p>Amtrak's reputation among potential passengers has historically been poor, Mr. Warrington acknowledged, because of trains that are late or in poor condition. He said the program was intended to demonstrate ''Amtrak's ability, desire and fixation about putting guests at the center of everything we do.''</p>
        <p>The company, formally the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, also revealed a new logo to replace the ''pointless arrow,'' as it is known, that has served for the last 29 years. The company plans to redesign waiting rooms, ticket booths, platform displays and printed material to match.</p>
        <p>To exercise the new guarantee, Amtrak is asking its customers to call their complaints to the attention of any employee. If the employee cannot solve the problem, Amtrak will issue coupons for repeat travel.</p>
        <p>The company anticipates, for example, issuing coupons to people for a problem with a seat or a sleeping compartment or to entire train loads of passengers if a train is extremely late. Amtrak promises to provide the free-ride coupon even if the problem is beyond its control, like an ice storm or derailment of another train on the route.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of fault, in the end, it's Amtrak that's responsible,'' Mr. Warrington told reporters today.</p>
        <p>Amtrak estimates that for every 100 people who try the railroad for the first time, 15 percent never ride again. If Amtrak can reduce that rate by one percentage point, its revenue would rise by $13 million a year.</p>
        <p>The railroad has also trained workers to help passengers when a train is late by calling ahead to notify relatives who were planning to pick up passengers at the station, for example, or by rescheduling travel connections and hotel accommodations. Company officials said they were taking cues from what travelers expect from airlines in similar circumstances.</p>
        <p>For the last three years Amtrak has been offering a similar satisfaction guarantee on a single train, the Coast Starlight, which runs daily in each direction between Seattle and Los Angeles, and has issued a free trip at a rate of one for every 107,000 passengers, Mr. Warrington said.</p>
        <p>But the railroad expects a much higher rate of complaints and refunds on other trains. It has told its 25,000 employees that if the rate of free tickets is held below one in 1,000 trips in any month, each of them will get a bonus for that month equal to the average price of an Amtrak ticket, which is now $50.</p>
        <p>The railroad said that ridership was up 7 percent in the last four months compared with the previous year and that in June, for the first time, it had revenue of $100 million.</p>
