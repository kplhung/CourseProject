        <p>A controversial  or maybe not so -- attack by 12 riders turned the Tour de France on its head today, placing nine supposed noncontenders high atop the overall standing and provoking angry charges of not playing by the rules.</p>
        <p>Blame it all on Jacky Durand, since everybody else probably will.</p>
        <p>Was he the one who launched the attack when the man in the yellow jersey, Laurent Jalabert, stopped at the side of the road to urinate? Under the unwritten code of bicycle racing, which hardly anyone has respected for years, riders are not supposed to speed away in such a situation. (Nor are they free to do so when a leader has crashed, although almost everybody does.)</p>
        <p>Leon Van Bon, a Dutch rider with the Rabobank team and the winner of this sixth stage, denied that Jalabert had been betrayed. ''Three or four of us did attack, but when we realized that Jalabert had stopped, we slowed down and were caught,'' Van Bon said. ''We attacked again when he was back in the pack.''</p>
        <p>Van Bon was contradicted by the new man in the yellow jersey, Alberto Elli, an Italian rider with Telekom. Poor Elli -- 13 years a professional and the Tour's overall leader for the first time at age 36, and the opening question he was asked in a news conference was whether Jalabert had been in the bushes.</p>
        <p>Elli answered yes. He quickly added that he had not launched the attack but had merely joined it. ''Somebody went off on the left while Jalabert was stopped on the right,'' he said. ''Like a lot of others, I joined the attack but I didn't start it.''</p>
        <p>A hard-working journeyman with some climbing talent, Elli is not expected to hold the lead long. Nor are his companions expected to remain in the upper reaches of the overall standing. But that, of course, is just what was said in 1990 when a similar long breakaway left four riders far ahead of the favorites, where some stayed for more than two weeks of the three-week Tour.</p>
        <p>With Elli and 8 of his 12 companions in the breakaway ensconced atop the standing, Jalabert, a Frenchman with the ONCE team, is now 10th, 5 minutes 40 seconds behind Elli. The other major contenders are even further back, with Lance Armstrong, the American leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, in 12th place, 5:54 behind.</p>
        <p>In second place behind Elli by 12 seconds is the unsung Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole. Marc Wauters, a Belgian with Rabobank, is third, 1:17 behind.</p>
        <p>Van Bon was clocked in 4:28.06 for the 198.5-kilometer (123-mile) stage from the medieval town of Vitre to the Loire Valley city of Tours in sunny and breezy weather. That meant an average speed of 44 kilometers an hour (about 27 m.p.h.). The main pack finished 7:49 behind, vaulting Elli from 21st place to the lead.</p>
        <p>The reason Durand, a French dynamo with the Lotto team, was suspected in the triumphant bolt at the 14th kilometer was his habit of launching attacks anywhere at any time. And this was a special day for him.</p>
        <p>''Allez Jacky.'' ''Allez Durand.'' ''Jacky Durand.'' ''Club Supporters Jacky Durand.'' ''Allez Dudu.'' Durand's name and nickname were writ large everywhere today at the start in Vitre because he is a native of the region, born and reared just outside nearby Laval.</p>
        <p>The 33-year-old Durand needs no encouragement to attack. His trademark is the long-distance breakaway, often solo, frequently with a companion or two.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the tactic works -- he has won two French national championships, two World Cup classics and three stages in the Tour -- but more often it does not. Twice already in this 87th Tour, which began Saturday, the Frenchman has stayed ahead of the pack for long periods and then been caught.</p>
        <p>Today was one of those days when he was not caught. No sprinter though, Durand could do no better than ninth place when the dozen riders finished and he now rests in sixth place over all, 3:27 behind Elli.</p>
