        <p>Little in Shakespeare compares with the final scene of ''The Winter's Tale,'' in which a statue of the long-dead queen of Sicilia, Hermione, returns to life, and to the arms of the penitent King Leontes, whose misguided jealousy sealed her doom 16 years earlier. In its magic and mystery (there is a hint that Hermione perhaps never died but was kept in hiding until an oracle's prophesy was fulfilled) and in its deeply romantic reconciliation earned by years of despair, it possesses the kind of ingrained schmaltz that Hollywood regularly attempts but most often attenuates.</p>
        <p>As staged by Brian Kulick in the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival's hugely satisfying production that opened yesterday at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, it is a finale played with a trembling dignity, the assembled courtiers and reconciled family members benumbed in disbelieving happiness.</p>
        <p>Making full use of the Delacorte's expansive, sky-roofed stage, Mr. Kulick has created an exquisite stage picture of emotion cracking through the scars of time. With the characters in the Victorian formalwear that is de rigueur in Leontes's court, which is deployed against a backdrop of panels that are alternately solid burgundy and painted with figures in Renaissance style, the whole tableau is deepened by a back wall lighted an elegant blue.</p>
        <p>When Aunjanue Ellis, as Hermione, steps down from her pedestal wearing a shimmering white gown and moving as if emerging from a great sleep, and is embraced by Keith David, as Leontes, in a grand long-coated tuxedo and on the verge of tears, the company appears as genuinely moved as the audience. They make a stunningly beautiful royal couple.</p>
        <p>The scene, so full-hearted as written, is, in its rendering here, a tribute to a company that seems extraordinarily suited to Shakespeare and well prepared by Mr. Kulick. (In a play that begins with the question of a child's paternity, Mr. Kulick has cast not only skillfully for craft and bearing but also cagily with ethnicity.) And it is the fitting conclusion to a production of a play that is among Shakespeare's most difficult to categorize.</p>
        <p>Generally classified as a romance, along with other late plays like ''Cymbeline'' and ''The Tempest,'' ''The Winter's Tale'' is nonetheless a stew pot of genres -- romance, yes, in the end, but with an extended comic interlude, and beginning with the tragedy brought on by Leontes's mad suspicion of his wife's infidelity with his boyhood friend, Polixenes, the visiting king of Bohemia.</p>
        <p>The first half of the play -- in which Leontes imprisons his wife, banishes their newborn daughter ostensibly to perish in the wild and commissions the murder of Polixenes -- is driven purely by Leontes's single-mindedness. A king without a war to make manifest his power, and apparently genteel enough to brook the gainsaying of courtiers who, within the bounds of true fealty, try to persuade him he's nuts to suspect his wife, he is, in a way, a compacted version of Shakespeare's other maddened monarchs.</p>
        <p>With little else to occupy him, he is incapable of escaping himself -- ''an Othello who is his own Iago,'' in Harold Bloom's felicitous shorthand. Defying even the oracular declaration of his foolhardiness, he dooms his wife and son; the death of the latter brings him to his senses, catalyzing a startlingly abrupt penance, which becomes his obsession for the next 16 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. David, tall and broad-shouldered, his head shaved, an earring in one ear, and possessed of a bass voice that is among the theater's most resonant and commanding, is simply terrific in humanizing the crazed behavior that is always in danger of caricature; his Leontes, never less than regal, is a figure whom one can imagine remaining loved in his lunacy, whose tyranny is seen by those closest to him as aberrant and tragic. And he is more than ably supported. Randy Danson as Paulina, Hermione's most stridently courageous defender; Jonathan Hadary as her husband, Antigonus, who brings exemplary nuance to a role that calls for a butler's sense of pride in subservience; and Henry Stram as Camillo, the aide who knows he will best serve the king by disobeying and abandoning him, all serve to underscore the painfulness of fidelity to an incomprehensibly ailing leader.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Ellis, who is generally more queenly in bearing than in diction, nonetheless provides perhaps the most aching moment of the play. Consigned to prison by her husband, his back turned to her in rage, she strokes his bald pate and gently bids him farewell, professing her devotion and her innocence: ''Adieu, my lord./ I never wished to see you sorry./ Now I trust I shall.'' In Mr. Kulick's staging, and Ms. Ellis's sadly resigned delivery, it is as heartbreaking as Shakespeare gets.</p>
        <p>That Leontes is redeemed in the end, despite bearing the blame for two deaths (his son's and that of Antigonus), is a signal of Shakespeare's encompassing interests in ''The Winter's Tale,'' a play that shifts abruptly into comic mode after it reaches Bohemia, and Antigonus, who, performing the errand of abandoning the banished child on the wild shores, is dispatched by the famous stage direction ''Exit, pursued by a bear.''</p>
        <p>In a nice touch that connects the play's halves over the divide, the bear is portrayed by Mr. David, wrapped in a coverlet with a bear's head, and looking back over his shoulder, worried and uncertain, as he trails a petrified Antigonus into the wings. Intermission, and a 16-year hiatus, ensues.</p>
        <p>In Bohemia, the play quickly devolves into a welter of confusions, complete with disguises, buffoonery and a quintessential Shakespearean trickster. This is Autolycus, a thieving and clever rogue (quite lovable, actually), who is played by Bronson Pinchot with a fluid string of the unidentifiable accents that have made his screen appearances notable and who, called on to sing, exhibits a surprisingly pleasant tenor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pinchot has been encouraged to horse around in a contemporary fashion, and his performance, I suspect, will strike some as distractingly silly -- especially when he dons a cockeyed Snidely Whiplash moustache -- but I found him finally winning and an apt emblem for a setting that Mr. Kulick has purposely created to be in striking contrast to the dark colors and courtly formality of the Sicilian scenes. Indeed, it's a startling adjustment for the audience returning after intermission. Bohemia is brightly lighted and open-spaced, with both the wilds and the gardens evoked by a stand of surrealistic trees, their trunks thin and straight, their efflorescence blocky nests of green, like dyed Rice Krispies squares perched on coat racks. It's kooky and appealing, and in Bohemia as well as Sicilia, the set designer, Riccardo Hernandez, and the lighting designer, Kenneth Posner, have contributed mightily. (This is an apt place to appreciate as well Anita Yavich's costumes and the sound by Mark Bennett; amazingly, the spoken dialogue in the Delacorte is crisper than in many Broadway houses.)</p>
        <p>And it is not just the stagecraft that has shifted. So have the pace and the tone. The plot proceeds with rapid-fire twists. The baby, Perdita, played by an ethereal beauty named Erica N. Tazel, who is making her professional debut, was discovered by a shepherd and his son, two clownish figures (Bill Buell, whose whimpery ingratiations suggest Andy Devine, and the excellent Michael Stuhlbarg) who have included her in their family, and she has grown to fall in love with Florizel, the son of Polixenes, who is among Shakespeare's most eloquently ardent lovers and is played with fine conviction by Jesse Pennington. All are manipulated by Autolycus, who was once Florizel's aide and whose greedy machinations end up setting everyone on shipboard on their way back to Sicilia and resolution.</p>
        <p>It would be pure comedy in the fashion of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' if not for the wrath of Polixenes (Graham Winton), who disapproves of his son's match with a presumably low-born girl, and who, in a scene that echoes the unhinged Leontes of 16 years earlier, threatens her life and the lives of her adoptive family. Mr. Kulick has Polixenes hold Perdita by the throat as he rages at her, just as he had Leontes do to her mother. It is up to Camillo, once again, to connive against the misguided violence.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it is the perpetual sense of circling back, of actions reiterated and humors melded, of life's going around and coming around, that makes ''The Winter's Tale'' so deliciously full, and makes the sentimentality of the ending less sweet than magnificent. It's a play that bespeaks gratitude for humanity's foibles and grace. And at the end of this production, walking out of the Delacorte into a lovely summer night, you may well hear your heart beating.</p>
