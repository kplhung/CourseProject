        <p>When it learned last year that a private company was offering college-level Advanced Placement courses on the Web, the lone high school in this remote gold-rush town thought it had finally discovered a perfect way to mine the genuine academic potential of the Internet.</p>
        <p>For the school, Trinity High, with 500 students, the prospect of hiring its own Advanced Placement teacher had always been an unaffordable luxury, even though taking such courses has become a near necessity for students to get into the most competitive colleges.</p>
        <p>So the school, in the redwood-dense mountains halfway between San Francisco and the Oregon border,  logged on. In essence, it took the Clinton administration up on its pledge that there was educational salvation in new technology, and that the Web could help the nation's poorest schools approximate the offerings of the wealthiest, particularly in a corner of the curriculum where the discrepancies are most stark.</p>
        <p>But so far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged, suggesting that a computer can be a crude substitute for a live teacher, particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them are so high and the technology is so new.</p>
        <p>Several thousand high school students nationwide took college-level  courses online this year through a private company, Apex Learning, or one of three state university systems. They included two teenagers here, each of them enrolled in an  Advanced Placement government and politics class in which the lessons were transmitted through electronic text and animated short films, with grades reported via e-mail. The teacher was never seen.</p>
        <p>One Weaverville student dropped out midway through the spring semester because, he said, he could not summon the stamina to continue, absent a teacher standing in front of him; the other student finished the same course, but two weeks late, frustrated by countless technical glitches that often prevented him from logging onto the Web for hours.</p>
        <p>Similar growing pains were felt by other districts, including some of those that also contracted with Apex, of Bellevue, Wash., a leader in providing Advanced Placement courses online. Of the 600 students in 28 states who enrolled in at least one of the company's online Advanced Placement courses in the last school year, two-thirds did not complete enough of the course work to take the final exam, Apex officials said.</p>
        <p>''This is still pretty new and we are all learning about it,'' said Sally Narodick, the chief executive of Apex, incorporated two years ago.</p>
        <p>Much is riding on whether such efforts succeed. While President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have heralded the educational possibilities of the Web, most of what has been labeled instruction in cyberspace is supplemental at best -- SAT training, college counseling and virtual field trips.</p>
        <p>But online Advanced Placement courses represent something else, one of the first real opportunities to marshal technology to plug gaping holes in the core curriculums of financially pressed rural and inner-city high schools that cannot afford luxuries like college-level courses.  Apex charges schools $325 to $400 per student. Hiring a teacher could cost more than $50,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Apex, one of the few for-profit ventures in the online Advanced Placement business, has raised $40 million from investors, including Warburg Pincus, a Wall Street firm; Vulcan Ventures, a fund led by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, and Edison Schools, the public school management company led by the entrepreneur Christopher C. Whittle.Michigan State University, the University of Nebraska and Johns Hopkins University are also offering college-level courses to high school students online.</p>
        <p>All are seeking to close one of the widest gaps between rich and poor schools. First begun as an experiment in the 1950's involving fewer than 2,000 students and a handful of college-level courses, the Advanced Placement program, run by the College Board, now involves more than 700,000 high school students who took 1.1 million final course exams for college credit this spring.</p>
        <p>Enrollment in at least one such course is regarded as an unofficial prerequisite for admission to the nation's most selective colleges, and the University of California system gives applicants who take such courses extra credit on their transcripts. Yet only half of the nation's high school students have access to Advanced Placement courses, which are regarded as a perk in districts strapped for cash.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, has proposed that every  high school in the country offer at least one Advanced Placement course by 2002, and add at least one new course each year over the next 10 years. The Clinton administration has asked Congress to spend $10 million to help rural and inner-city schools purchase Advanced Placement courses online.</p>
        <p>To Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, such online courses are a weak stand-in for what he says the country needs: 180,000 teachers trained to offer college-level courses to two million more high school students.</p>
        <p>But Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of the University of California at Santa Cruz, says such plans are pipe dreams, considering that many of the districts lacking Advanced Placement courses have a severe shortage of teachers in even basic subjects. Often, Mr. Hernandez said, an online course, however flawed, is the only opportunity a student has. This past school year, the University of California College Prep Initiative, conceived by Mr. Hernandez and operated out of the system's Santa Cruz campus, used state grants to pay for 800 California high school students to take Advanced Placement courses online. They included the two at Weaverville.</p>
        <p>''Our intent is not to be an alternative to a high quality teacher and classroom,'' Mr. Hernandez said. ''Our intent is to be an alternative to nothing, and that's what they're getting right now.''</p>
        <p>In Weaverville, a town of 3,370 people, many of them loggers and forest rangers, the experience of the two students who took Apex's online government course underscored the program's promise and its flaws.</p>
        <p>For Brian Jones, 19, a senior who wants to be a record producer, and Jeremy Forbes, 18, a classmate who dreams of becoming a cartoonist, taking college-level ''U.S. Government and Politics'' introduced them to the concepts of pluralism, federalism, liberalism and conservatism. Both said they now looked at presidential politics in a new light.</p>
        <p>But each was tripped up by shortcomings that, so far, are embedded in such courses.</p>
        <p>In mid-March, in the 7th week of the 15-week course, Mr. Jones was still doing work he should have completed in the second week. He said he was overwhelmed by the idea of writing a two-page essay twice a week and taking an exam every three weeks. And with his professor, Steve Sandweiss, 448 miles away in Tacoma, Wash., where he is a professor at a community college, Mr. Jones dropped out, enrolling instead in his high school's civics course.</p>
        <p>''I didn't feel like doing any work,'' he said. ''I'm just not organized a lot of the time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes was far more dogged, but he had continual problems signing onto the Apex Web site -- sometimes because of problems on Apex's end, and sometimes because of the limited capacity of the computers in his school. Mr. Forbes finished the course two weeks late, and took the Advanced Placement exam. He will  know his grade soon -- but said that for all the disruption he felt well-prepared for the exam.</p>
        <p>Apex officials said that they were already working to rectify the problems, smoothing software miscommunication, extending the course calendar by three weeks and providing training for mentor teachers in students' high schools. But Mr. Forbes's guidance counselor, Noreen Bradbury, said that even in their present form, the online courses were a godsend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bradbury said she already had 11 students signed up to take advanced courses next year in history, statistics, psychology, government and economics.</p>
        <p>''It opens the world to our kids,'' she said. ''They're not distant and different from everyone else out there. They're as good.''</p>
