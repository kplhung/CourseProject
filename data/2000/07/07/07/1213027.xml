        <p>The district attorney, Richard A.

        <p>A Brooklyn man who was arrested after throwing a baseball back onto the Shea Stadium field after it was tossed into the stands by John Rocker will not be prosecuted, the Queens District Attorney said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said the fan, Gregory Sweeney, 25, was not acting with criminal intent when he threw Rocker's toss back to the field during the Mets' 10-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves last Sunday. Brown noted that Rocker had safely returned to the Braves' bullpen by the time the ball landed on the field and suggested that Sweeney was simply goaded on by ''50,000 accomplices,'' chanting and urging him to throw the ball back. Sweeney had been charged with second-degree reckless endangerment.</p>
        <p>''A review of the available tapes and witness interviews indicate that no one was seriously placed at risk,'' Brown said. ''It would appear that Mr. Sweeney had no criminal intent and was doing nothing more than following tradition in returning the unsolicited and unwanted souvenir.''</p>
        <p>Rocker had tossed the ball into the stands after warming up left fielder Reggie Sanders.</p>
        <p>Brown pointed out that during the same game, another fan, in keeping with the longtime baseball tradition, had thrown back a Braves home run ball, but was not arrested.</p>
