        <p>The Yugoslav Parliament approved constitutional changes today that allow the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, to run for a new term and that diminish the influence of Montenegro, Serbia's small sister republic.</p>
        <p>The changes, which the Parliament portrayed as strengthening democracy, require the direct popular election of the Yugoslav president and of the upper house of Parliament. They allow two four-year terms for the president and raise the threshold for impeachment.</p>
        <p>The effect will be to give Mr. Milosevic a very good chance of remaining in power past July of next year, when his current term expires. Until today, the federal president was elected by the federal Parliament and could serve only one four-year term. And the upper house of the federal Parliament was itself elected by the Parliaments of the two republics, Serbia and Montenegro .</p>
        <p>The changes put the federal government, instead of the two republics, in charge of organizing elections.</p>
        <p>Montenegro, under President Milo Djukanovic, has broken with Mr. Milosevic and moved toward the West, and has vowed to hold a referendum on independence. Today's changes make Mr. Milosevic's plans for elections less dependent on Montenegro's consent and may hasten Montenegro's risky effort to break away.</p>
        <p>Montenegrin leaders expressed outrage at today's votes. One told The Associated Press, ''Yugoslavia was erased today.''</p>
        <p>''Since this amounts to the constitution of a new country, Montenegro is now forced into making inevitable moves,'' said Miodrag Vukovic, a senior adviser to President Djukanovic. ''In the next few days, Montenegro will adopt laws which will wrap up its independence in all fields.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic must call federal and municipal elections by the end of this year, and he is likely to hold presidential elections at the same time, while the opposition is bickering and the independent media are under increasing pressure from the government.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Djukanovic decides that Montenegro should boycott the federal elections, they will take place anyway, and Mr. Milosevic's allies there, who attract at least 30 percent of the vote, will win seats.</p>
        <p>Serbia's divided democratic opposition, most of which already boycotts the Parliament and thus did not vote against the changes, seemed caught by surprise, without a clear candidate to run against Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The lower chamber passed the changes 95-7, while the vote in the upper chamber was 27-0.</p>
        <p>In today's debate, the Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj, argued that direct elections were the rule in most modern democratic states.</p>
        <p>But Vladeta Jankovic of the opposition Democratic Party of Serbia told the lower house: ''The constitution is being changed for the sake of just one man.'' He denounced the haste of the voting, and said: ''It is shameful that we are agreeing to adapt the constitution to one man, Slobodan Milosevic, who should rule forever and move from one presidential armchair into another until infinity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has already been elected to two terms as Serbian president, and when he could not run again under the constitution, he became federal president, taking on sweeping powers not foreseen for this putatively figurehead office.</p>
        <p>Now, reaching the constitutional limit for this job, Mr. Milosevic has changed the constitution to allow two terms.</p>
        <p>But he has also challenged the democratic opposition to beat him in a direct vote.</p>
        <p>While deeply unpopular in opinion polls, Mr. Milosevic is nonetheless regarded by Serbs as better at his job than any of the democratic leaders, who are considered ambitious and divided.</p>
        <p>In a poll done in early May for the National Democratic Institute, some 38 percent of Serbs said that Mr. Milosevic ''may not be perfect, but he's better than the opposition,'' and he remained the most popular choice as leader of Serbia -- the only one whose ratings were larger than the ''don't knows.''</p>
        <p>Still, only 14 to 18 percent of the people, in various polls, think he is the best leader for Serbia. But his ratings are three times higher than those for Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who gets about 6 percent, while the Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, gets about 3 percent.</p>
        <p>Dragoslav Avramovic, the former head of the Central Bank who beat back Yugoslavia's inflation, gets about 8 percent, but he is old and ill. Still, if the opposition could unite behind a single candidate in a two-way race, a Milosevic victory would not be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>For Montenegro, which has about 600,000 people compared to Serbia's 10 million, the changes undercut some of the artificial protections it received as Serbia's formal equal in the federal structure. Given its tiny size, it is unlikely that a Montenegrin could ever win election as federal president.</p>
        <p>Montenegrin officials also complained that they were not consulted on these changes.</p>
        <p>The republic's government and Parliament will meet on Friday, when they are likely to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of what happened today.</p>
