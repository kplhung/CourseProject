        <p>In a significant turnaround, the Giuliani administration has abandoned its resistance to federal oversight of how the New York Police Department handles brutality cases against officers, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The change in the administration's position, first reported yesterday in The Daily News, came during negotiations with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, who have said they will bring a civil rights lawsuit against the city in an effort to force changes in the way officers accused of abuses are investigated and disciplined.</p>
        <p>But officials cautioned that despite the administration's willingness to consider federal oversight, significant obstacles remain to an agreement between the city and the  prosecutors, who began their inquiry in August 1997 after the torture of Abner Louima by officers in a Brooklyn station house.</p>
        <p>City lawyers and the prosecutors have been negotiating for about a year in an effort to forestall the lawsuit, which would be brought under a federal civil rights law enacted in 1994 after the videotaped beating of Rodney King by police officers in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Under the law, federal prosecutors can sue municipalities to force court-ordered structural changes in how a police department operates if they can prove it engages in ''a pattern or practice'' of civil rights violations.</p>
        <p>The city's willingness to accept federal oversight is significant because Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has long insisted that the New York police did not need such oversight and that the department was one of the most closely monitored in the nation. The change removes one of the major obstacles to an agreement, which would make a lawsuit unnecessary. Such litigation would be lengthy and costly, both for the city and the federal government.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani would not discuss the city's talks with the prosecutors from the office of Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, saying no decisions have been made. ''I never discuss settlements, discussions of settlement, possible discussions of settlements, and I never discuss what I'm thinking about them because they're all confidential,'' the mayor told reporters.</p>
        <p>And he would not answer questions about whether he had changed his stand on the question of a federal monitor, simply repeating that there were several hundred other police departments in the nation that he believed were more deserving of federal oversight. ''Its record for restraint, its record for discipline, its record for performance, is better than the records of most police departments in the country,'' he said. ''That all remains true, and those are just facts.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lynch also would not answer questions about the matter.</p>
        <p>But several officials who are knowledgeable about the negotiations said that oversight of the department by federal authorities ceased to be an issue several months ago, and that the talks had since focused on the nature of the oversight and how it would be carried out. Among the matters yet to be resolved, the officials said, is how the oversight would be structured.</p>
        <p>One official said a key issue that remained in dispute was how any agreement would be enforced. The city has been extremely reluctant to enter into consent decrees in which a federal judge would have the final say over disputes that might arise.</p>
        <p>Under the 1994 law, the Justice Department has negotiated such consent decrees in Pittsburgh and in the cities of Steubenville and Columbus in Ohio, where the police departments operate under a federal monitor. The law requires that the United States attorney's office seek a negotiated settlement before bringing a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The negotiations between the city and Ms. Lynch's office are based on an exhaustive investigation. The Police Department provided the United  States attorney's office with documents on hundreds of cases in which  officers were accused of using excessive force. In many cases, federal  prosecutors and investigators working under their supervision reinvestigated cases and explored the discipline that was meted out.</p>
        <p>They also conducted extensive interviews with senior police officials,  focusing on high-crime precincts where there were significant reductions in reported crime and at the same time reductions in the number of complaints of civilian abuse against the officers they oversaw.  And they examined the department's management practices and how officers are disciplined, finding lapses in how excessive force cases were investigated, how the officers were disciplined and how officers with troubled histories were monitored, according to officials involved in the  inquiry.</p>
        <p>The Police Department yesterday would not comment on the Eastern District's investigation or its negotiations with the city, but Police Commissioner Howard Safir has maintained that the department is a model of restraint, citing recent figures that show a decline in citizen complaints about police use of force.</p>
