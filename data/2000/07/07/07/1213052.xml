        <p>With uncertainty growing as to whether Congress will pass legislation to define patients' rights, President Clinton traveled outside Washington today to set the stage for turning the issue into political ammunition for the Democrats in the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>''We have an obligation in Washington to pass a strong patients' bill of rights,'' Mr. Clinton said to dozens of health professionals and other supporters at the University of Missouri campus here.</p>
        <p>He praised a version of the bill that passed the House last year with the support of Democrats and some Republicans but criticized one enacted by the Republican majority in the Senate, which he said might be worse than not passing any bill.</p>
        <p>A patients' bill of rights would, for the first time, set federal standards for private health insurance, notably health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. For decades, insurance has been regulated by the states.</p>
        <p>The Congressional battle over a bill is hovering in the twilight between compromise and breakdown. While continuing negotiations, both sides are also looking ahead to carry the battle into the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton warmly praised Missouri's Democratic governor, Mel Carnahan, who is running for the Senate. Governor Carnahan, who stood at Mr. Clinton's side along with a phalanx of white-coated health professionals, backed a patients' bill of rights that became state law in 1997. He hopes to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, the Republican incumbent who has resolutely supported his party's leaders in pressing for a more limited version.</p>
        <p>Senator Ashcroft said in a statement today that he had always supported ''a real patients' bill of rights.'' Regarding the president's remarks, he said, ''People have a right to expect leadership to fix problems, not to fix blame.''</p>
        <p>There are two primary differences between the parties. The House version supported by Mr. Clinton would cover people in every health plan in the nation, an estimated 161 million subscribers. The Republican Senate version would apply to those not already covered by state laws, an estimated 56 million people.</p>
        <p>In addition, the House version would make it easier for patients to sue their H.M.O.'s and employers than the Senate bill would.</p>
        <p>Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is the assistant majority leader in the Senate, has argued that legislation making it easier to sue employers would only discourage them from offering health insurance.</p>
        <p>''It has always been my goal to send an enforceable, responsible patients' bill of rights to the president this year,'' Senator Nickles said in a statement today. ''But what I will not do is to pass a bill that would cause employers to drop health insurance, dramatically increase costs and force millions of Americans into the ranks of the uninsured.''</p>
        <p>The issue of which version of a patients' bill of rights is preferable is likely to figure in several races in the fall. It has already become an issue in Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race in New York against Representative Rick A. Lazio, Republican of Suffolk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio voted against the bipartisan House version last year. Mr. Lazio's spokesman said the Congressman ''has consistently supported the Republican version, which is a patients' bill of rights rather than a lawyer's right to bill.''</p>
