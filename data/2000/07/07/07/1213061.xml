        <p>An unblinking Serena Williams watched her final serve of the day as it crashed into the net and died in the grass. Too stunned at the blunt end of the semifinal spectacle today, she hesitated to move, frozen in a worn patch on the baseline.</p>
        <p>A double fault on match point. Once the reality of it nudged her, Serena Williams pressed her fingers against her eyes to dam her emotions and walked in the direction of her subdued big sister. On the scoreboard in the corner, V. Williams had defeated S. Williams, 6-2, 7-6 (3), to advance to the Wimbledon final, where Lindsay Davenport will await on Saturday.</p>
        <p>It was not a celebratory moment for Venus Williams, just the end to an awkward day. Before she and her sister exited beneath uneasy applause at Center Court, Venus Williams slung her racket bag over her shoulder and then hovered over her crestfallen little sister. She put her arm around Serena, helped her gather a few items on the court, and whispered, ''Let's get out of here.''</p>
        <p>''I'm always the big sister,'' said Venus Williams, who smiled but remained restrained after advancing to her first final of a Grand Slam since her 1997 appearance at the United States Open. ''I always take care of Serena, no matter what. I always make the decisions. I'm always a role model for Serena. I'm the big sister. I always worry about her.''</p>
        <p>Serena Williams dismissed the idea that this loss hurt worse than another, but she appeared uncommonly crushed just moments after the match. Glancing up from beneath a blue cap pulled low on her forehead, Serena's eyes looked puffy and her voice shook when she tried to explain what happened.</p>
        <p>''I expected to play a lot better than I did today,'' she said. ''It was my goal to do better in this tournament, but that's O.K. I'm only 18. Venus is 20. I have a lot of years ahead of me.''</p>
        <p>And yet, Serena was the player many had picked to win. She was the sister with the sharper serve, the one with a more precise game. She was the one who had already won a Grand Slam, the one who left her older sister's self-esteem in a puddle after winning the United States Open. Today Venus Williams was the one who left Serena stunned.</p>
        <p>''She's a younger sister, and that's the way it is when you're younger,'' Venus Williams said. ''You always get your way. Anyone who has had a younger sibling knows that. When they don't get their way, Mom and Dad step in and say, 'Give her the ice cream.' As an older sister or the older brother, you roll with the punches.''</p>
        <p>As unnatural as it seemed, Venus Williams had to take the match from Serena. True to her nature, Venus remained cool and unflustered from the outset. While Serena Williams desperately tried to coax out her killer instinct by shaking her fists, pounding her racket and smacking her thigh, Venus calmly pressed onward with fewer mistakes. Of the 40 unforced errors made by Serena Williams, too many came on pivotal points. She converted only 2 of 11 break-point opportunities. Venus Williams converted 4 of 5.</p>
        <p>Serena held a 4-2 lead in the second set, but failed to convert three break points on her sister's next serve. On all three chances, Serena Williams lost control of a wobbly forehand. That was just the beginning of trouble. Over the next three games, Serena lost 11 straight points. Suddenly, Venus Williams led, 5-4.</p>
        <p>''In Venus's last five matches, she didn't serve that well,'' Serena Williams said. ''That's the one thing I was counting on. But she decided she was going to serve well today.''</p>
        <p>The tie breaker proved it. When Venus Williams needed her serve, she summoned it on cue. With a 4-points-to-3 lead, Williams unwound her sinewy frame and lashed a 121-mile-an-hour serve at her compact little sister. Although Serena was able to muscle the blast back, Venus Williams took the short ball and zipped it across the net at an unreturnable angle.</p>
        <p>Through a fortnight marked with 50-minute matches, straight-set victories and just one break of serve, Serena could not come up with the same perfection against her sister. Her serve deserted her. On match point, Serena Williams served her sixth double fault of the day.</p>
        <p>''I never double fault,'' Serena Williams said. ''Usually, I'll play a tough three-set match and I'll hit one double fault the whole match. Today, I don't know. I hit a lot.''</p>
        <p>That last double fault only underscored the anti-climactic nature of the match. It was built up like a prizefight. For two days, every element of the sisters' rise was explored, from their days on the cracked courts of Compton, Calif., to the new home Venus and Serena Williams recently purchased. Richard Williams -- master storyteller and eccentric architect of his daughters' rise -- beamed with pride as he told every anecdote.</p>
        <p>But he was not around for what unfolded at Center Court. In the private box next to the court, family friends like Gladys Knight cheered on Venus and Serena. The sisters' mother, Oracene, was in Florida, too exhausted to make the trip, and their father was taking a long walk. For most of the day, Richard Williams strolled the neighborhoods within a two-mile radius of the All England Club. He did not watch a single point.</p>
        <p>''It was too difficult to watch,'' said Richard Williams, who made his way to the grounds once the 1-hour-27-minute match was over. ''I didn't see the point of it. There was a lot going through my head.''</p>
        <p>The way the sisters mirrored each other's style -- bludgeoning the balls from the baseline, tracking down every angle with their speed -- there was an element of strategy missing. They knew each other's game almost too well. Although there were riveting rallies, punctuated by mesmerizing power, the match was pockmarked by too many errors.</p>
        <p>''Serena and Venus both appeared nervous and didn't look happy to be there,'' said John McEnroe, who is analyzing the tournament for television broadcasts. ''There was no way for them to be totally comfortable. I don't care how many times they say it, it wasn't just another day in the park.''</p>
        <p>The fans' response was unusual, as well. They were conflicted by the circumstance. Not understanding which sister to applaud, not knowing when a cheer would be insensitive, the spectators remained hushed for most of the match. Once it ended, there was just a gentle ovation.</p>
        <p>Venus Williams would not have wanted a big fuss. She was not in the mood to celebrate beating her little sister. It wasn't the right time.</p>
        <p>''It's really bitter,'' she said. ''But someone had to move on. It was either going to be me or Serena. In this instance, it was me.''</p>
        <p>Next time, it could be Serena. Is there a family plan for the sisters to alternate? In the end, there was scant evidence to support the conspiracy theories. Upon match point, it was hard to imagine Serena Williams manufacturing such a stunned and dispirited state.</p>
        <p>''Serena is a real competitor, probably even more than what I am as far as when it comes to losing,'' Venus Williams said. ''She hates to lose. So that really hurts deep.''</p>
        <p>When she saw Serena hurt today, the big sister knew just what to say: ''Let's get out of here.''</p>
        <p>A Title Defense for Davenport</p>
        <p>Lindsay Davenport, Wimbledon's women's singles defending champion, stealthily slipped under the hoopla surrounding the Williams sisters semifinal today and quietly made her way past Jelena Dokic, 6-4, 6-2, to advance to the final.</p>
        <p>''Today was pretty exceptional; two sisters playing a semifinal,'' Davenport said. ''By no means should myself playing Dokic overshadow that. I mean, that's pretty special.''</p>
        <p>Davenport seemed to revel in her anonymity. Davenport, without an ounce of envy, allowed her opponent for Saturday's final, Venus Williams, to collect all of the attention.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that the only reason I'm here is to play tennis,'' said Davenport, who is here without either of her parents. ''I'm pretty much aware that I'm a lot different than other players here, and very lucky for it. It's like even one of my cousins was here today. I asked, 'You going to stay for the final on Saturday?' It was like, 'No, I've been gone for a week, and I want to go home.' Then my friend goes: 'That's your whole family. I can't believe that.' But that's just the way they are. They're kind of over my tennis career, I think.</p>
        <p>''When you have more than one child, at least with my parents, they tried really hard to treat all of us equally, treat the whole family the same. Guarantee, though, they'll be watching. Maybe my mom will come over. I know she was disappointed she wasn't here last year.''</p>
