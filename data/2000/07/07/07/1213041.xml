        <p>Representative John Conyers Jr. has asked Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the death of a 32-year-old black man who was choked to death in a shopping mall parking lot during a scuffle with security guards trying to recover a $4 bracelet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, made the request late Wednesday as he and a coalition of civil rights advocates gathered with more than 9,000 protesters outside the Lord &amp; Taylor department store where the man, Frederick Finley, died on June 22.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finley, who had been shopping in the store with his family, was on his way home to Detroit when five plainclothes security guards from the store followed him out and accused his 11-year-old stepdaughter of stealing the bracelet.</p>
        <p>As the guards tried to detain her, the police said, Mr. Finley punched one of them, and the other guards put him in a choke hold. Family members said a guard pressed his knee against Mr. Finley's throat.</p>
        <p>The incident has left the Fairlane Town Center shopping mall and this southwestern Detroit suburb on edge, once again grappling with a long history of racial tension.</p>
        <p>Today, the Wayne County prosecutor charged one of the guards, Dennis Richardson, with involuntary manslaughter.</p>
        <p>''Under all circumstances, the duration and amount of force used by Richardson was excessive,'' Prosecutor John D. O'Hair said. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison or a fine of $7,500 or both. Lawyers representing the Finley family said that second-degree murder would have been a more appropriate charge and that Mr. Richardson should not have been the only guard charged.</p>
        <p>Despite the charge, and the fact that Mr. Richardson and three of the other guards are black, Mr. Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he wanted a federal investigation because he believed Mr. Finley was a victim of racial profiling, which Mr. Conyers said was as rampant in retailing as on highways.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the attorney general confirmed that Ms. Reno had received a call from Mr. Conyers and that they had spoken. But the spokeswoman would not discuss the details of the conversation or say whether Ms. Reno was planning an investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conyers said blacks who worked for white businesses, just like whites who worked for white businesses, could be trained to focus on blacks as criminals.</p>
        <p>''It's not just a matter of driving while black. It's a matter of shopping while black, living while black,'' Mr. Conyers said. ''We're not taking it anymore. We demand that the one place we're supposed to be able to go  for civil rights remedies gets on the case.''</p>
        <p>The police have said that Mr. Finley's stepdaughter was observed on videotape taking the bracelet. Lawyers for the family and civil rights advocates said the girl simply forgot to pay for it. At the time he died, Mr. Finley, a limousine dispatcher, had $604 in his pocket and had purchased $40 worth of clothing for his stepdaughter, the lawyers said. Mr. Finley and his wife had also given the store their address and phone number as part of a credit card application.</p>
        <p>''They had them on videotape, they had their address. They could have just called the police,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, one of the lawyers representing the family in a lawsuit against Lord &amp; Taylor and its parent company, the May Corporation. ''They didn't have to kill him. He was only defending his daughter.''</p>
        <p>A coalition of civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and Dick Gregory, are pressing Lord &amp; Taylor officials to disclose the store's policies for training guards and apprehending people suspected of shoplifting.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the store would not comment.</p>
        <p>The protesters, mostly black, who jammed the Lord &amp; Taylor parking lot on Wednesday night came with  signs and tales of discrimination and harassment. Amid shouting ''no justice, no profits'' and slicing up Lord &amp; Taylor credit cards, they recalled the climate at the mall just four years ago, when the Detroit chapter of N.A.A.C.P. urged blacks to boycott the mall because of accusations of racism. Others told stories of being escorted out of Dearborn parks during the 1980's because of an ordinance that barred nonresidents.</p>
        <p>''They've always made it clear out here that we aren't welcome. They follow you around in the stores, just waiting to pounce,'' said Mary Anne Robinson, 50, one of the protesters.  ''Now they're showing us our lives aren't even worth a $4 bracelet.''</p>
