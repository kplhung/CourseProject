        <p>The cause of the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law a year ago was probably that Mr. Kennedy, with hardly any experience flying his plane alone at night, became disoriented in haze, the National Transportation Safety Board said today in a staff report.</p>
        <p>One of his flight instructors offered to fly with him that night, but Mr. Kennedy said ''he wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor told the investigators who prepared the report.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, who had not yet qualified for flying with instruments alone (as opposed to seeing visual cues through the windows), probably had less than one hour's experience flying his plane at night without an instructor, the report said. It noted that a common cause of crashes among pilots untrained in instrument flying was taking off when visibility was good (a situation known as Visual Flight Rules, or V.F.R.) but flying into conditions where it was not, making the piloting more difficult than they can handle.</p>
        <p>In this case, the report said, the condition was haze that obscured the horizon. Pilots who cannot see the horizon must rely on instruments to tell if they are in level flight or if they are banking. But a disoriented pilot can bank a plane into a fatal spiral.</p>
        <p>The report cited six kinds of illusion that can lead to disorientation, without stipulating which one came into play in this case. ''Spatial disorientation as a result of continued V.F.R. flight into adverse weather conditions is regularly near the top of the cause/factor list in annual statistics on fatal aircraft accidents,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Using the autopilot would have helped, according to aviation experts, because it is not subject to disorientation, but Mr. Kennedy was flying his plane manually.</p>
        <p>''Flying at night over featureless terrain or water, and particularly in haze or in overcast, is a prime setup for spatial disorientation, because you've lost the horizon,'' said Warren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.</p>
        <p>The crash killed Mr. Kennedy, 38, who was at the controls of his single-engine Piper Saratoga II; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; and her sister, Lauren G. Bessette, 34.</p>
        <p>From the weather forecasts, Mr. Kennedy would have known that he would be out of sight of land on his trip, Mr. Morningstar said. ''It becomes a question of pilot judgment: do you put yourself into that situation if you're not appropriately trained and rated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Exactly how much experience Mr. Kennedy had is not clear, because investigators did not recover his logbook. But they estimated that he had logged around 310 hours, including 55 at night. He had flown only about 72 hours without a flight instructor on board, an unusually low number, according to instructors. But he had been studying for his instrument rating, one reason for having few unsupervised hours.</p>
        <p>Weather reports on the night of the crash -- July 16, 1999 -- cited haze or mist and visibility as low as four miles. Pilots who flew over the Cape Cod-Martha's Vineyard area that night reported serious haze; one told investigators he had flown over Martha's Vineyard and thought there was a power failure on the island, because he could not see any lights.</p>
        <p>The report said that investigators had interviewed one of Mr. Kennedy's flight instructors, who said he ''would not have felt comfortable'' with Mr. Kennedy ''conducting night flight operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions similar to those that existed on, the night of the accident.''</p>
        <p>Another instructor told the investigators that he had made the flight to Martha's Vineyard with Mr. Kennedy six or seven times, often at night. ''The instructor stated that the pilot was methodical about his flight planning and that he was very cautious about his aviation decision-making,'' the report said. The instructor also said that Mr. Kennedy ''had the capability to conduct a night flight'' to Martha's Vineyard, ''as long as a visible horizon existed.'' The plane crashed about 7.5 miles southwest of Gay Head, at the island's western end.</p>
        <p>Like most reports on the crashes of private planes, this one was issued by the board's staff, without a hearing or a meeting by the five board members to approve its contents, as is usually done for airline crashes. The report runs substantially longer than the average for general aviation accidents, however. It is available on the Web at www.ntsb.gov /aviation/nyc/99@178.htm.</p>
