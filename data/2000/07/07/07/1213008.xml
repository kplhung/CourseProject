        <p>Adam Graves rushed into the Park Avenue Country Club, running late because of a traffic jam, and sporting a new haircut, his blond hair trimmed nearly to the scalp.</p>
        <p>Asked if the new look was a silent vote for the Rangers to bring back his friend and former teammate who has popularized a similar look, Graves just laughed and replied: ''I can't comment. I could get in trouble.''</p>
        <p>But Graves did not need to provide any subtle hints because when prodded, he quickly expressed his wishes that the Rangers would consummate the long-discussed return of Mark Messier to Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''I'd be remiss if I didn't say I'd love to play with him again,'' Graves said. ''He's a tremendous, not only human being, but a tremendous player, and I'd relish the opportunity to play on the same team and hopefully the same line as him again. I hope it works out and he's able to come back and wear the uniform that he looks best in.''</p>
        <p>Graves was in Manhattan as a part of the New York Home Team Fund, a charitable effort founded by Mets pitcher Al Leiter, which hopes to raise money and awareness for children's charities. The group has enlisted Graves and Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet and hopes to soon have members of every other New York sports team. It will donate its initial funds to New York University's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine to create a family recreation room for children.</p>
        <p>But the conversation shifted toward the Rangers. Their new president and general manager, Glen Sather, has indicated that he would like to bring Messier back, and is also interested in the free agents Claude Lemieux and Vladimir Malakhov.</p>
        <p>''I think you look at Mark and the big thing is the way he takes care of himself,'' Graves said. ''Physically, he's in as good of condition as 85, 90 percent of the league. I think the way the game has gone over the last 10 years, it's so much more defensive-oriented and a position game, so it bodes more to the mental side. If you're smart and you understand the game the way he does, I think he can still play at a high level and I think for some time.''</p>
