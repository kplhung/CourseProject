        <p>Squeezed by rising gasoline prices and discouraged by cool, rainy weather, Americans put a brake on retail spending in June, new figures showed yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sales in stores open for more than a year, a crucial figure for measuring the health of the retail industry, rose 2.6 percent for the month compared with the period a year earlier, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. Except for March, when Easter sales were delayed by a month, that is the lowest percentage increase since September 1997.</p>
        <p>As anemic as the numbers were, analysts said that they were in line with expectations that the economy was losing steam.</p>
        <p>''We expected to see a slowdown,'' said George Strachan, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''The weather was bad. Fashion was bad. Basically, it was a pretty bad month.''</p>
        <p>Consumers are not increasing their spending as much at all types of stores, ranging from specialty apparel stores like the Gap to discount stores like Kmart and department stores like Dayton Hudson, a unit of Target.</p>
        <p>Much to the dismay of the merchants, consumers have shown an increasing distaste throughout the year for buying clothes, in particular. ''There's no question that apparel sales have slowed as we've moved through the year,'' said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''We've seen a steady deceleration in same-store sales. This month they were barely positive.''</p>
        <p>In what could be another sign of a consumer slowdown, Federated Department Stores, the parent company of the Macy's and Bloomingdale chains, said its second-quarter earnings would be hurt by credit card defaults at Fingerhut, its catalog arm. Fingerhut sells merchandise mostly to lower-  and middle-income Americans, and credit troubles there could foreshadow more widespread consumer woes.</p>
        <p>Even discount chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, which led the booming growth last year, all reported moderate to poor sales in June. Wal-Mart's sales increased 4.8 percent at stores open for more than a year, but the rise was mostly a result of food sales, analysts said. Target's discount stores reported growth of 2.1 percent, in large part because of difficulties with its women's apparel business, a company spokeswoman said. Over all, Target's sales rose 1.1 percent. Kmart fared the worst, showing a 1 percent drop in sales, also because of problems with apparel, one analyst said.</p>
        <p>Department stores and specialty stores also had difficulties. There were widespread markdowns to get rid of excess inventory, and analysts said such price cuts could eventually reduce profits.</p>
        <p>In the specialty retail sector, Gap Inc., which has been struggling to get the fashion mix in its stores right for nearly nine months, missed again in June as sales fell 2 percent. Sales at the company's Old Navy division dropped by at least 7 percent, but analysts said that was because Old Navy had phenomenal growth of more than 30 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Gap also announced yesterday that it would miss earnings estimates by 3 cents a share for the current quarter, but its shares rose $3.75, to $33.625, because analysts expected the news to be worse.</p>
        <p>The Limited, on the other hand, reported a 6 percent increase in same-store sales, but its stock hardly moved. It continued to benefit from its teenager-friendly Express division, analysts said, but investors were less confident about the Structure and Lane Bryant divisions, both of which reported decreasing sales.</p>
        <p>There were a few standouts in terms of sales. Neiman Marcus, for example, pulled in more customers by having its annual men's sale in June instead of May and by cutting back on its more moderately priced lines. Its sales rose 17.3 percent. And Intimate Brands, which reported a 9 percent sales increase, was bolstered by lingerie sales at its Victoria's Secret Stores.</p>
