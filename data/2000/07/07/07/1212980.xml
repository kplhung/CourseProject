        <p>When I was in college my boyfriend and I were baby-sitting for a neighbor and had just put the children to bed. We were both reporters for the campus newspaper and somehow decided our right to know extended to the private papers on the desk of the people who had trusted us to watch their children.</p>
        <p>Within minutes we hit pay dirt: a letter from the husband to his wife, confessing adultery after she had found incriminating hotel bills.</p>
        <p>But our successful snooping didn't feel rewarding or even titillating. Instead we felt ashamed. We tried to arrange the papers exactly as we'd found them and hoped our employers didn't see the guilty look in our eyes as we rushed out the door at the evening's end.</p>
        <p>That's the seamy beauty of CBS's ''Big Brother'': voyeurism without guilt. We've all been invited to peep at 10 people who have volunteered to live together nonstop for three months, under constant surveillance by 28 cameras and 60 microphones. Not only must they endure one another, they must live without many creature comforts (dishwashers, clothes dryers) and without contact with the outside world (no computers, television, telephone or newspapers). They can swim in the backyard pool, grow vegetables in the garden and gather eggs from their CBS-supplied chickens.</p>
        <p>Already a hit in Europe, ''Big Brother'' originally was scheduled to begin last night. But CBS advanced the premiere one day to take advantage of the popularity of its other ''reality'' show, ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor,'' however, is shown only one night a week. We can watch people in the ''Big Brother'' house constantly: five nights a week on television, in both live and taped broadcasts, and nonstop on the Internet. But the producers have assured viewers in advance that the bathroom camera will not be part of the live broadcast, to prevent reoccurrence of an embarrassing moment in the Netherlands version.</p>
        <p>We can even participate. Every two weeks the home audience votes (by telephone) to evict one of the residents and ultimately determines which of three finalists wins the $500,000 grand prize.</p>
        <p>Is this the end of civilization as we know it? Hard to tell from the Wednesday night one-hour premiere, which was a giant tease. The contestants spent most of the hour traveling on the streets of Los Angeles in a caravan of identical white S.U.V.'s, conjuring a memory of O. J. Simpson's Bronco. While waiting for their arrival at the house, the hostess-anchor, Julie Chen, explained and exclaimed with relentless enthusiasm. (Ms. Chen is a newscaster on ''The Early Show''; her credibility may never recover from this.)</p>
        <p>''The show has already rocked several countries in Europe,'' she hyperbolized. Then she presented a montage of video clips from the European editions. Judging from these, here's what we have to look forward to: conga lines, deodorant spritzing, leg shaving, smooching, fighting, more smooching, pillow fighting, X-rated smooching (under wiggling comforters).</p>
        <p>While waiting for the caravan to arrive, Ms. Chen introduced the contestants, who appear in brief taped biographies, with commentary from friends and family. Her co-host, Ian O'Malley, gave a tour of the house and its hidden cameras. While Ms. Chen seemed ready to pop through the screen with excitement, he'd barely shaken himself awake.</p>
        <p>But neither host is nearly as odd as the people who have volunteered to lock themselves in the house for national exhibition. There's Jamie, crowned Miss Washington, U.S.A., (described as ''a beauty queen with a 4.0 average''), who declares that she was sorry to miss ''community service and things like that.'' If there were a choice, however, between relinquishing her crown and participating in ''Big Brother,'' she says, the title would just have to go.</p>
        <p>From the Midwest comes George, seen posing in the snow in boxer shorts and nothing else. He says that if America can get a thrill at looking at an overweight, hairy guy walking around in his underwear, ''have at it!''</p>
        <p>One young man lost his leg to cancer as a child; another lost his mother. A buff-looking woman competes in triathlons and is writing a book, but she earns her living as an exotic dancer. As in ''Survivor,'' one contestant is pierced: this one in the nose rather than the nipple. She lets us know that she's a virgin.</p>
        <p>A mother of four says she needs a break from her kids. Hasn't she heard of a spa?</p>
        <p>Finally the contestants arrived. The annoying Ms. Chen herded them to the front of the house, through a cheering gaggle of friends and family. As the ''Big Brother'' group awkwardly kissed loved ones so long and blinked at the lights, it became apparent that this show will be tackier and creepier than ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>In the middle of the night I peeked at the contestants on the Internet, at bigbrother2000.com, to see if any comforters were rustling suspiciously. After a half-hour, I was rewarded only by a shift in position by one of the men. It's just the beginning, but so far there's more Web action on www.stinkymeat.net, the Web site that follows the decomposition of various meat products, day by day.</p>
        <p>This bizarre gimmick illustrates yet again how desperate the networks are for ratings. It's a brave new world in television land, because even couch potatoes can summon the energy to click through dozens of  channels. How big is ''Survivor's'' much-vaunted success? Preliminary ratings show that ''Survivor'' was watched in about 15.1 million of the country's 100.8 million television households this week. On its first night ''Big Brother'' was seen in about 13.9 million households. Compare those numbers with the highest-rated episode of the ABC mini-series ''Roots,'' also a special event, which in those network-dominated days of January 1977 was seen in 36.4 million of the 71.2 million television households, more than half.</p>
        <p>In fact ''Big Brother'' continues a CBS tradition. A half-century ago, on ''Truth or Consequences,'' another CBS game show, the host, Ralph Edwards, brought onstage the mother of a (real) soldier stationed in Korea. They chatted and then she was taken offstage, while Mr. Edwards prepared a surprise for her.</p>
        <p>This is how the critic Jack Gould reported the event in The New York Times:</p>
        <p>''Mr. Edwards, with an air of triumph, brought out Mrs. Cunningham to see her boy, upon whom she had not laid eyes for 31 months. Across her face in a flash there came that heart-rending combination of anguish and relief any woman would show upon seeing a son or husband returned from war. It was an intensely private, personal moment, which no outsider had the right to share. The sensitive viewer could not help but be embarrassed and ashamed.''</p>
        <p>Ah, the sensitive viewer. Does he exist anymore? Did she ever?</p>
        <p>THE OPEN MIND  Channel 13, New York,  Sunday, July 15 and 22, at noon</p>
        <p>''It's not really clear that we do care about privacy,'' says Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor and author, who's been out promoting his new book, ''The Unwanted Gaze: The Destruction of Privacy in America.''</p>
        <p>Talking to Richard Heffner on two half-hour segments of ''The Open Mind,'' Mr. Rosen gives a fascinating, eclectic introduction to Privacy 101, which includes the admonition in Jewish law against waiving the right not to be spied upon, the inalienable ''right to dignity.'' Something to think about as you cruise the Internet or watch ''Big Brother.''</p>
