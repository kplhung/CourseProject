        <p>The Gtech Holdings Corporation, the world's largest lottery company, said yesterday that its two top executives had resigned and that its revenues would fall short of expectations.</p>
        <p>The Rhode Island company said the departures of William Y. O'Connor, chairman and chief executive, and Stephen P. Nowick, president and chief financial officer, were a result of the board's dissatisfaction with the unexpected revenue announcement, Gtech's lagging stock price and the poor handling of a computer miscalculation in Britain's national lottery that recently came to light.</p>
        <p>W. Bruce Turner, a former gambling analyst who joined Gtech's board last year, will step in as nonexecutive chairman. The company said it had begun a search to fill the other positions.</p>
        <p>The company said revenue for the year would miss forecasts by $15 million to $21.5 million. Two weeks ago, Gtech announced first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations by 12 percent, its best performance in more than a year. In speaking to analysts and reporters then, executives gave no indication a revenue shortfall was imminent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner said news of the shortfall came as a surprise to the board ''that we just learned about within the last few days.''</p>
        <p>''But forecasts are guesses, some of which are beyond your control, some of which should not be out of your control,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turner said a recent decision by the Rhode Island Legislature to cut fees for video lottery operators, a move that will deprive the company of roughly $3 million this year, could not have been anticipated. Nor could the company have foreseen a problem like Colombia's postponement of its national lottery, which could cost the company as much as $15 million in lost sales for the year.</p>
        <p>But Gtech also disclosed cost overruns for projects in Israel and Australia. The company said it was seeking to determine the extent of the overruns and whether they could have been avoided. Gtech designs and sells computer systems for state-run lotteries, and some analysts speculate that the miscalculated costs were a result of inaccurate bids by the company.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the board's patience with Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Nowick might have been stretched by their handling of other problems. In May, Gtech came under scrutiny for a 1998 computer malfunction that resulted in a miscount of the number of winners in Britain's national lottery. The problem was fixed within a month, but neither Gtech's board nor the company operating the lottery, Camelot, was informed, Mr. Turner said.</p>
        <p>When he became chairman of Gtech in 1998, Mr. O'Connor was widely viewed as a moral boost to a company that had become known for ethical lapses. A co-founder, Guy B. Snowden, had resigned after a British jury found he had committed libel against Richard Branson, head of the Virgin Group. In addition to allegations that Mr. Snowden tried to bribe Mr. Branson in connection with an effort to win a contract to operate Britain's national lottery, Gtech had been investigated for trying to influence politicians and lottery officials in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor fired executives and installed a former F.B.I. official to oversee Gtech's compliance efforts. But while the moves helped restore confidence in the company among potential customers, they did little to lift its stock price, which fell from a high of $40 in 1998 to no higher than $26 over the last year.</p>
        <p>Analysts say Gtech's lackluster stock performance, despite its relatively consistent earnings, is attributable to the slowdown in new public lottery projects in the United States. With budget surpluses across the country, few states have turned to lotteries to generate revenue. Gtech already holds contracts with 28 of the 38 states that have lotteries, offering few opportunities for sustainable growth, analysts say.</p>
        <p>As a result, most of the company's efforts are now directed overseas, where roughly half of all lotteries are not yet automated.</p>
        <p>Shares of Gtech fell $2.9375, to $19.8125, yesterday.</p>
