        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Like Ghost Ships, They Disappeared as Throngs Were Waiting'' (news article, July 5):</p>
        <p>I felt a surge of spirit and pride on the Fourth of July as I glimpsed the first of the tall masted ships in the distance. I had waited three hours at Riverside Park with my wife, daughter and thousands of others in anticipation of this highly publicized event. Then, to our dismay, the ships turned around at West 47th Street, leaving a bitter and disappointed crowd in their wake.</p>
        <p>The decision to snub the many thousands of people assembled between West 72nd Street and the George Washington Bridge who had been lured to the banks of the Hudson by a media blitz of false promises was an insult to the public that should not be ignored.</p>
        <p>ROBERT J. KRENGEL  Brooklyn, July 5, 2000</p>
