        <p>The glittering annual dinner of the Bronx Democratic organization recently drew many of New York's political aspirants, from Hillary Rodham Clinton to nearly all those seeking citywide office in next year's municipal elections.</p>
        <p>While they came to schmooze with -- and to be seen by -- hundreds of rank-and-file political workers in the borough, they came mostly to pay homage to the man in the center ring of the Bronx's circus-like politics: Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the county's  Democratic Party chairman.</p>
        <p>He has been the Democratic leader in the city's most solidly Democratic borough for the last six years and now commands wide respect from party officials near and far. After 10 years in the Assembly, he has become highly regarded for his keen sense of politics and its rhythms, and he has demonstrated an ability to forge coalitions.</p>
        <p>But a series of decisions he has made recently has fueled speculation -- and debate -- about this veteran politician's stewardship of the party and enabled critics to cast doubt on his motives. In the last month alone, Mr. Ramirez announced that he would not seek re-election to the Assembly this year, and he took the unprecedented step of withdrawing his longstanding support for an incumbent congressman in the Bronx. At the same time, he has forged an alliance with a political faction that had been nothing less than an enemy camp.</p>
        <p>And so Mr. Ramirez has been the topic of intense discussion, not only by those who were at the annual dinner at Marina del Rey overlooking Long Island Sound, but also by politicians from New York to Albany to Washington. The Chairman, as he is known, is seen as standing at the height of his political game, but at the same time, he is stepping into a defining moment of his political leadership.</p>
        <p>''Up until this point, Roberto Ramirez has made a lot of smart political decisions, and he has been very successful,'' said Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Democratic assemblyman from the Riverdale section of the Bronx. ''But I wonder whether this year might be a little different. He has worked hard to avoid primary fights. This year, he is actually helping to create them. Time will tell how smart these political decisions have been.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez contends that his rationale should be accepted at face value. He is abandoning elective office, he maintains, to devote more time and energy to running the Democratic organization in the Bronx, widely known among Bronx politicos as ''County.'' His central priorities, he said, are to elect Fernando Ferrer, the borough president, as mayor in 2001 and H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, as governor the following year.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said he wanted to play a greater role in developing a new group of elected officials to assume the seats that have to be vacated by City Council members forced out by term limits next year. Those seats represent nearly the entire Bronx delegation. And he said he wanted to shepherd in a new generation of members of the Legislature.</p>
        <p>''Whenever this is all said and done, I would like to know in my heart that I have been a part of a process that changed the political culture. Period,'' he said, seated at a desk in County's headquarters.</p>
        <p>Changing the culture, he explained, would mean crusading for a more inclusive party membership that would become influential. He said that he hoped to broaden his efforts to create a stronger connection between the party and ''poor constituencies.''</p>
        <p>And he scoffed at those who would question his motives, reminding them that his support of Sheldon Silver during this year's attempt to unseat him as Assembly speaker could have led to his serving as majority leader.</p>
        <p>People, he said, ''expect the continuous hunger from politicians to achieve another level of higher electability. My power doesn't flow from the elective office or political office. My power flows from the strength of my convictions. If you can influence people, you have power.''</p>
        <p>Life outside Albany, though, is laden with potential mines. His decision to support State Senator Larry B. Seabrook in the September primary for Congress over Representative Eliot L. Engel, a six-term incumbent, stunned many because it is rare for a party chief to abandon a sitting congressman. Mr. Ramirez said he dropped his longstanding support of Mr. Engel because the congressman had become ineffectual and was out of touch with his district.</p>
        <p>''I'm too independent for Roberto Ramirez,'' said Mr. Engel, who represents the northern Bronx and parts of Westchester County. ''He wants someone to kiss his ring and do everything he tells him to do.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ramirez's relationship with Mr. Seabrook can best be described as somewhere between distant and hostile. In fact, Mr. Seabrook was once part of a faction of Bronx Democrats who bitterly opposed Mr. Ramirez's leadership.</p>
        <p>Moreover, in a city where politics is often viewed through the prism of race, the endorsement of Mr. Seabrook has been Mr. Ramirez's most controversial move yet. He has been criticized by some officials -- and in some Jewish newspapers -- for withdrawing his support of Mr. Engel, who is Jewish, in favor of Mr. Seabrook, who is black. Politicians close to Mr. Engel have criticized the endorsement as a maneuver to earn black support for Mr. Ferrer's mayoral campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez bristles when race enters the conversation. ''When people say that the only reason I supported Larry Seabrook was because I wanted to get black votes for Fernando Ferrer, it absolutely offends me,'' Mr. Ramirez said. ''It amazes me that there are so many triple standards in this city when it comes to politics and race.</p>
        <p>''No one in his right mind would argue that you will attempt to convince Jewish voters to vote for a candidate on the basis of an endorsement,'' he continued. ''It certainly didn't happen when I supported Ruth Messinger for mayor. No one suggested that I was supporting her over Rev. Al Sharpton because I was trying to get Jewish votes.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Ramirez points out, Mr. Seabrook has been endorsed by a large number of Bronx officials, including some who are Jewish.</p>
        <p>But what is also clear, according to Bronx officials who know him well, is Mr. Ramirez's determination to help foster a new relationship between the city's black and Hispanic elected officials to exert greater political influence in New York City. Mr. Ramirez came of age politically during the fractious days of the 1970's and 1980's -- the era of mayoral aspirations of politicians like Percy E. Sutton, Herman Badillo and Herman D. Farrell -- when black and Puerto Rican officials battled bitterly over which group would assume the Democratic candidacy for City Hall.</p>
        <p>To that end, Mr. Ramirez has developed a close working relationship not only with Mr. McCall, the only black official to win statewide office, but also with Mr. Sharpton. Mr. Seabrook is a longtime political ally of Mr. Sharpton's, and Mr. Ramirez's decision is viewed by many Bronx officials as a move to assist Mr. Ferrer. By assisting one of Mr. Sharpton's allies, the reasoning goes, Mr. Sharpton would feel indebted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton, who is considering running for mayor next year, acknowledges that Mr. Ferrer would almost certainly benefit if his name were not on the ballot.</p>
        <p>''Roberto Ramirez wants to be part of a new era of empowerment,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''He is passionate and, at the same time, a skilled politician. I'm sure that one of the things he will do is to try to convince me not to run and to support Freddy. But we have developed the kind of relationship that even if I do run, we can work together.''</p>
        <p>But the Engel-Seabrook race is but one contest where Mr. Ramirez's role as a political tactician will be put to the test this year. Indeed, in contrast to past election years, Mr. Ramirez is dealing with a large number of high-stakes challenges to incumbents.</p>
        <p>In the South Bronx, former State Senator Pedro Espada Jr. is seeking to reclaim his former seat in a race against David Rosado, who is closely aligned with Mr. Ramirez's organization. Mr. Espada, a longtime political adversary of Mr. Ramirez, has amassed a large campaign staff and considerable funds.</p>
        <p>In the northeast Bronx, Mr. Ramirez has endorsed Carl E. Heastie, a budget analyst in the office of the city comptroller, for the Assembly, as part of a slate that includes Mr. Seabrook. But Mr. Heastie is being challenged by Joey Jackson, a lawyer and former Ramirez ally, who is making a defiant run against the Democratic organization.</p>
        <p>Another primary battle is in the State Senate district that includes parts of Riverdale and the Belmont and Pelham Bay sections of the Bronx, as well as part of Westchester County. There, Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a lawyer and the wife of former State Attorney General G. Oliver Koppell, is running for the Democratic nomination for the seat now  held by State Senator Guy J. Velella, a Republican.</p>
        <p>But after Mrs. Koppell entered the race, Mr. Ramirez decided instead to support Michael R. Benedetto, an elementary school teacher and Democratic district leader.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Mr. Ramirez has developed a style of political discipline vaguely reminiscent of political bosses of old. He has had a major role in the selection of judges who are placed on the ballot. He has presided over a Democratic machine that has kept internal party fighting to a minimum while discouraging insurgents -- often with agile legal maneuvering -- from getting a spot  on the ballot.</p>
        <p>He has generally been successful at bringing into his camp politicians who -- like Mr. Seabrook -- were once among his strongest detractors. And his successes in winning Bronx votes for Democrats citywide and statewide have made him one of the state's most respected tacticians. ''I wish all the 62 county chairmen were as effective as Roberto Ramirez,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer.</p>
        <p>In fact, many politicians, particularly those aligned with Mr. Ramirez, suggest that the new generation of leadership he is championing has less to do with race than with political philosophy. They contend that Mr. Ramirez is seeking to install officials across a wide ethnic spectrum who harbor a greater commitment to the welfare of less affluent New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>''The attention has been on the minority area, because that's where the open seats have been,'' said Mr. Heastie, the Assembly candidate who is being backed by Mr. Ramirez. ''There will be openings in other areas next year. And you will see that he will support people who are committed to the working people of the Bronx, irrespective of race.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Mr. Ramirez will have a summer-long period of intense political activity, after which political leaders throughout the state are likely to look at the scorecards and reassess Mr. Ramirez's leadership. But Mr. Ramirez insists that his mission cannot be measured by wins and losses on Election Day.</p>
        <p>''I have put myself in a position from which I can't lose,'' Mr. Ramirez said. ''Candidates that I support may get less votes then candidates that I oppose. But I won't lose. The question to ask is: Did I actually live up to the words I said? And have I worked to change the political culture in this city?''</p>
