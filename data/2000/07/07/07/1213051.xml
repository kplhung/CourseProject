        <p>After months of lobbying Congress, the cities and towns ripped apart by September's flooding got a glimpse of their reward today: an appropriation of $30 million in emergency public works and economic development money to rebuild stricken downtowns.</p>
        <p>More than 200 municipalities in New Jersey experienced some form of flooding from Tropical Storm Floyd, but those that were hurt the worst were the old downtown areas of Bound Brook and Manville in Somerset County; Lodi, in Bergen County; and Trenton.</p>
        <p>Today, at a presentation in Manville, federal economic development officials explained that the money, appropriated as part of a military construction bill that President Clinton is expected to sign, could be spent on public or business projects.</p>
        <p>Mayor Frank J. Ryan of Bound Brook said the community needed the money.</p>
        <p>''We're the oldest community in Somerset County,'' Mayor Ryan said. ''Our sewer lines need to be looked at, and our sidewalks and curbs on Main Street still aren't 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>In Manville, where the Millstone and Raritan Rivers combined to sweep through town, ''a good two dozen'' stores still have not reopened, said Gary Garwacke, the town administrator and engineer. Besides devastating the downtown, the waters damaged 1,200 homes.  Mr. Garwacke said he hoped to get $1 million from the new federal money.</p>
