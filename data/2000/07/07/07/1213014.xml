        <p>Editorial says United States should press Egypt for release of recently arrested sociologist and democracy advocate Sad Eddin Ibrahim and for political rights of all Egyptians</p>

        <p>Egypt arrested a prominent sociologist last week, along with at least eight of his colleagues, and shut down the democracy institute where they work. The government said the sociologist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, was suspected of, among other things, accepting funds from the European Union and harming Egypt's image by making a voting rights video that discussed past election fraud.</p>
        <p>The arrests follow a campaign of attacks on Dr. Ibrahim in the Egyptian media and represent the latest harassment of advocates of democracy and human rights by the government, which appears to be trying to silence them before parliamentary elections this fall. If Egypt is truly worried about its image, it should end its embarrassing assault on independent activists.</p>

        <p>Egypt arrested a prominent sociologist last week, along with at least eight of his colleagues, and shut down the democracy institute where they work. The government said the sociologist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, was suspected of, among other things, accepting funds from the European Union and harming Egypt's image by making a voting rights video that discussed past election fraud.</p>
        <p>The arrests follow a campaign of attacks on Dr. Ibrahim in the Egyptian media and represent the latest harassment of advocates of democracy and human rights by the government, which appears to be trying to silence them before parliamentary elections this fall. If Egypt is truly worried about its image, it should end its embarrassing assault on independent activists.</p>
        <p>The accusations against Dr. Ibrahim and other staff members of his institute, the Ibn Khaldoun center, are similar to those brought in the past two years against other activists. The Egyptian authorities also tightened regulations on nongovernmental organizations last year with a law that was recently declared unconstitutional on technical grounds.</p>
        <p>Egypt's human rights community is understandably alarmed that the government would move against the prominent and well-connected Dr. Ibrahim, who also holds American citizenship and is a professor at the American University in Cairo. According to one of Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers, several of his staff members are still in jail, and no one has been able to visit Dr. Ibrahim since Monday. The government has 15 days to investigate charges against him, but can renew his detention indefinitely. His request for bail was denied.</p>
        <p>Egypt seems to be harassing Dr. Ibrahim for his democracy work and for activities like accepting foreign donations and criticizing government actions. This is not criminal conduct and should not be treated as such. Washington, which gives Egypt $2 billion a year, says its ambassador has raised the case with Egypt's prime minister. The United States should continue to press for the release of Dr. Ibrahim and his staff, and for the political rights of all Egyptians.</p>
