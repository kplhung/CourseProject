        <p>''Big Brother'' was certainly big for CBS in its first broadcast Wednesday night, scoring a higher rating for its first episode than either of the two previous summer reality television hits, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC and ''Survivor'' on CBS.</p>

        <p>''Big Brother'' was certainly big for CBS in its first broadcast Wednesday night, scoring a higher rating for its first episode than either of the two previous summer reality television hits, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC and ''Survivor'' on CBS.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother'' pulled in 22.5 million viewers -- more than ABC and NBC combined -- between 9 and 10 p.m, but the show did reveal some signs that it may not have the kind of phenomenal appeal, at least initially, that the other summer hits have demonstrated.</p>
        <p>''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' looking, meanwhile,  to revive some of its own phenomenal edge, returned from two weeks of repeats last night with an edition that featured the crowning of yet another million-dollar winner, the show's fifth. And ABC held a news conference yesterday to disclose that yet another million-dollar winner would turn up within the next week on ''Millionaire,'' the show that started the current trend toward reality formats imported from Europe.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' which throws 10 strangers together in a house full of cameras, clearly benefited from being placed directly after ''Survivor'' Wednesday night. That tropical island adventure series continued to smash every rating record for CBS in the summer. This week ''Survivor'' reached its highest numbers ever among young adult viewers. ''Big Brother'' impressively held onto most of those young viewers and even improved on ''Survivor'' among viewers between the ages of 18 and 34. But the show suffered falloff in terms of total viewers during each quarter hour it was on, indicating some possible boredom with the show.</p>
        <p>On ''Survivor'' the audience levels have consistently risen at the half-hour mark every week. Last night ''Big Brother'' declined by over a  million viewers at the half-hour mark.</p>
        <p>Overall ''Survivor'' had a 15.1 rating (each rating point represents just over one million homes) while ''Big Brother'' had a 13.9 rating.</p>
        <p>Viewers may have been expecting something different: the first ''Big Brother'' show was not typical of the usual format for the series in that it filled most of the hour with feature profiles of the 10 participants and spent very little time actually with them inside the house they will share for the next three months.</p>
        <p>The show faced a bigger test last night when it began on its own at 8 p.m. as a half-hour show. This one was in its usual format: an edited version of what takes place in the house over the group's first two days together. ''Big Brother'' needs to keep up audience interest levels because it will be on five nights a week through September.</p>
        <p>On ''Millionaire,'' meanwhile, a math teacher from Tennessee named Kim Hunt won the big prize by knowing that Lesotho is a land-locked country totally contained within another country. (The other choices: Luxembourg, Mongolia and Burkina Faso.)</p>
        <p>He needed help from a friend on the $500,000 question: In the 1964 movie ''My Fair Lady,'' who dubbed the singing voice for the character Eliza Doolittle? His friend knew it was Marni Nixon -- not Julie Andrews, or Shirley Jones, or Roberta Peters.</p>
        <p>The executive producer of ''Millionaire,'' Michael Davies, said yesterday that he decided to discuss the coming million-dollar winners because ''rumors were rife'' about more contestants winning the big prize.</p>
        <p>As for the fact that ABC held a news conference about ''Millionaire'' the same week that CBS was starting  ''Big Brother,'' Mr. Davies said he agreed to the idea somewhat reluctantly because he certainly did not want any hint of implication that his show was creating million-dollar winners to counter CBS's ratings surge this summer.</p>
        <p>''We've had about 2 to 3 percent of our contestants win the million and that seems about the right percentage,'' Mr. Davies said, though he acknowledged that having two big winners in about a week strains the statistics a bit. Defending the overall level of questions the show is asking, Mr. Davies said, ''I feel clearly a contestant has to have a fair chance at winning.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' has been compared with ''Millionaire'' mainly because ABC initially tried to use the game show to stunt the ratings growth of the adventure series. But Mr. Davies has been effusive in praising the CBS show.</p>
        <p>Regis Philbin, the host of ''Millionaire,'' joked yesterday that when ''Survivor'' first beat ''Millionaire'' in the ratings, ''I sobbed that night.''</p>
        <p>But he later said he had seen only one ''Survivor'' episode ''and all they were doing was throwing spears at a banana.'' He said he decided, ''It's just not for me.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' continues to be especially successful with young adult viewers, the audience that CBS has had most trouble reaching, and the audience that many advertisers pay a premium to reach. It was up 10 percent among viewers 18 to 34 and up 12 percent among viewers 18 to 49, compared with the previous week, and in both cases had more viewers in those groups than all three other big broadcast networks combined.</p>
