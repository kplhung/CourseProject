        <p>A big band doesn't survive for 37 years without being flexible. Orchestre Tropicana d'Haiti, one of Haiti's two reigning big bands along with its older rival, Orchestre Septentrional, celebrates its 37th birthday in August. When it performed for dancers on Friday night at Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing series, it ambled between homegrown tradition and congenial extensions.</p>
        <p>Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, and Orchestre Tropicana gives more than a glance over the border. Between Haitian compas tunes, the singers switched from Kreyol (Haitian Creole) to Spanish as the group played its own versions of bolero, cumbia, Dominican merengue and the stripped-down Dominican ballad style called bachata. In place of the bachata's spiky acoustic guitar, the keyboardist used a banjo sound.</p>

        <p>A big band doesn't survive for 37 years without being flexible. Orchestre Tropicana d'Haiti, one of Haiti's two reigning big bands along with its older rival, Orchestre Septentrional, celebrates its 37th birthday in August. When it performed for dancers on Friday night at Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing series, it ambled between homegrown tradition and congenial extensions.</p>
        <p>Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic, and Orchestre Tropicana gives more than a glance over the border. Between Haitian compas tunes, the singers switched from Kreyol (Haitian Creole) to Spanish as the group played its own versions of bolero, cumbia, Dominican merengue and the stripped-down Dominican ballad style called bachata. In place of the bachata's spiky acoustic guitar, the keyboardist used a banjo sound.</p>
        <p>Yet Orchestre Tropicana holds on above all to the unhurried beat of the  compas. The occupation of Haiti by the United States from 1915 to 1934 brought swing bands, and Haitians adapted the lineup for their own dance music. Haitian big bands played compas with a gentle beat that carried a jovial, evolving interchange of riffs from saxophones, brasses and singers. Then, in the late 1960's and 1970's, along came so-called minijazz bands like Tabou Combo. Guitars took over the horn parts, and the rhythm eased toward rock and salsa.</p>
        <p>Orchestre Tropicana, which is directed by Louis Jean, has not ignored  the changes. Its songs from recent decades have added guitar licks and synthesizer lines to the round-robin of riffs. It has also moved from songs about love and domestic troubles -- like ''Angelique,'' which complains that she always cooks the same meal -- to songs with uplifting messages. Yet the saxophones, trumpets and trombones have held onto their unslick, blithely out-of-tune dialogues, and the music remains breezy and affable.</p>
        <p>Orchestre Tropicana's songs get better as they grow longer. They can seem understated, almost lackadaisical, when they start. After a minute or two, they are unassumingly pleasant, with smoothly crooned melodies over the clip-clopping compas beat. But after about four minutes, something mysterious happens. New riffs keep turning up from every section of the band. And the mesh and colloquy of stuttering saxophones, cheerful sustained trumpets, pearly syncopated guitar lines, calliopelike keyboard phrases and self-effacing percussion directly insinuate themselves into feet and hips, making dancers move without a hint of pressure. For all its modesty, the music persists because it never wears out its welcome.</p>
