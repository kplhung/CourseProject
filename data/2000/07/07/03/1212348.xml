        <p>INTERNATIONAL</p>
        <p>A3-8</p>
        <p>Challenger to Ruling Party In Mexico Wins Presidency  Vicente Fox Quesada, the rough-spoken rancher and businessman who galvanized a maverick grass-roots presidential campaign, scored a momentous victory in Mexico's presidential election, ousting the political party that has ruled for 71 years. President Ernesto Zedillo conceded that his Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, had lost.</p>

        <p>Many Mexicans who live in the United States returned to their country to vote, crossing south over the border from as far away as San Francisco, Washington and Chicago.</p>

        <p>Uganda 'No Party' System Vote  Voters overwhelmingly endorsed Uganda's ''no-party'' political system, according to final results, though only half of registered voters went to the polls. Leaders of Uganda and neighboring Rwanda met over the weekend to defuse tensions over their role in the fighting in Congo.</p>

        <p>Israeli Dispute Over Trees  The Jewish National Fund in Israel, whose tree-planting program long epitomized the Zionist enterprise in its ambition to make the desert bloom, has been accused of uprooting saplings planted by tourists to make way for the next day's busloads. It set up a committee to investigate.</p>

        <p>10 Saved From Indonesia Ferry  After nearly three days spent clinging to debris, 10 people were rescued from a passenger ferry crammed with nearly 500 people that sank off an Indonesian island last week, officials said. More than 480 passengers are still missing.</p>

        <p>Criticism of Iraq Policy  The Clinton administration's failure to act on its pledge to support the fractious, far-flung opponents of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has prompted growing criticism from Republicans in Congress, who used a visit to Washington by Iraqi opposition leaders to intensify attacks on the administration's policy toward Iraq.</p>
        <p>A7</p>
        <p>Scott Ritter, the former United Nations arms inspector who quit two years ago charging that Secretary General Kofi Annan and American officials were undercutting efforts to disarm President Hussein, now says the Iraqis have no prohibited weapons of any importance left.</p>

        <p>Albright Focusing on Legacy  As Madeleine K. Albright shuttled from region to region last week, the question of what legacy she will leave as secretary of state was never far away. One thing is clear: in the last six months of her term, she wants to concentrate on her vision of democracy.</p>

        <p>Mongolia Votes for Parliament  Election results trickled in from Mongolia's parliamentary elections yesterday, with the nation's resurgent former Communists expecting to make strong gains. An American group observing the vote confirmed that at least two candidates of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party -- the former Communists -- had won in the capital.</p>

        <p>Miles to Go in Campaign, Amid Gloom and Confidence  It is no secret that even with 130 days to go before the election, Democrats are unsettled, even gloomy, while Republicans are confident. Could the presidential race be over barely after it started? One national poll had Vice President Al Gore 13 points behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But even Bush loyalists concede that Democrats should not despair -- at least not yet.</p>

        <p>Former Incumbents Seek Seats  In the battle for control of Congress, three of the most hotly contested House races this year involve former incumbents who quit to run unsuccessfully for other offices and are trying to reclaim their old seats.</p>

        <p>Religion in the Classroom?  Close on the heels of the Supreme Court's latest ruling against officially sponsored prayer at public schools, the Colorado State Board of Education is expected, on Thursday, to pass a resolution on that encourages public schools to display the national motto ''In God we trust.'' The effort has drawn criticism as yet another attempt to bring religion into the classroom in Colorado.</p>

        <p>Only 2 Names on Reform Ballot  When the balloting begins on Wednesday in the Reform Party presidential primary, voters will have only two choices: Patrick J. Buchanan, the former conservative television commentator, and John Hagelin, a physicist.</p>

        <p>EDUCATION</p>
        <p>Pressure at an Early Age  Higher education has become a preoccupation for children even before they reach puberty, with many sixth graders driven to excel by parents who had seized on test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for success.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Another Year of High School  The president of the American Federation of Teachers plans to propose today that schools add an optional fifth year to high school to help students meet academic standards required for a diploma. In her speech as the union opens its biennial convention in Philadelphia, Sandra Feldman, the group's president, will call for a ''transitional-year'' program, either before ninth grade or in high school, in which adult-literacy specialists would help teenagers lacking basic skills catch up so they could confront more challenging course work.</p>

        <p>The Wolf's Endangered Status  The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray wolf, which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in the lower 48 states, is abundant enough in a few places in its range that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection afforded the country's most endangered species.</p>

And then there is the Bat'kivshchyna, the official, if utterly broke, representative of Ukraine, and a floating testament to either the indomitability of the human spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law.</p>

        <p>The Harry Potter Phenomenon  By all accounts there will be tens of thousands of sleepless children and parents -- perhaps many more -- showing up in bookstores late Friday night to snap up ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' when it officially goes on sale at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The children's book, the latest in the wildly popular series by J. K. Rowling, is already a publishing phenomenon, fueled by a shrewd marketing campaign by Scholastic.</p>

        <p>Inquiry Casts a Shadow  As collectors and dealers gathered in London last week for Christie's and Sotheby's big sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the auction houses' legal troubles in the United States seemed to make no difference to the buyers. Still, it was clear that the shadow cast by the federal antitrust investigation in New York had crossed the Atlantic.</p>
