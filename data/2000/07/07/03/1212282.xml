        <p>Voters in Uganda overwhelmingly endorsed the nation's ''no-party'' political system, according to final results released today, though only half of registered voters went to the polls.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the leaders of Uganda and neighboring Rwanda met over the weekend to defuse tensions over one of the problems that has most troubled Ugandans -- Uganda's role in the fighting in Congo. Last month, Rwanda and Uganda, nominally fighting on the same side, skirmished for the third time in the Congolese city of Kisangani. At least 600 people died, aid groups say, most of them civilians.</p>
        <p>Today, as the final votes in the referendum were tallied, Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Paul Kagame of Rwanda issued a joint statement calling for renewed respect for the cease-fire between their countries and, more broadly, in  Congo itself.</p>
        <p>The two nations have been close allies, both fighting to overthrow the government of the Congolese president, Laurent Kabila.</p>
        <p>The fighting in Congo is unpopular in Uganda, and opponents of Mr. Museveni had used the issue against him in the referendum on whether to retain the current no-party state or to return to a multiparty political system.</p>
        <p>In the end, 88 percent of Uganda's voters still favored Mr. Museveni's no-party system, while 9 percent wanted a return to traditional political parties. The balance, from voting on Thursday, were voided ballots.</p>
        <p>The turnout, however, was just 51 percent. As results trickled in during the last three days, opposition leaders said the low turnout proved the success of a boycott they had organized and indicated widespread discontent with Mr. Museveni. In 1996, the last presidential race, three quarters of the voters went to the polls.</p>
        <p>The vote was, in many ways, a referendum on the popularity of Mr. Museveni, who strongly opposes the return of more than one party.</p>
        <p>In campaign appearances around the country, he argued that parties merely divide Uganda by tribe and religion and gave rise to the dictators Idi Amin and Milton Obote in the 1970's and 80's.</p>
        <p>In Uganda, political parties may exist in name only. Parties may not hold conventions or rallies or field candidates for office. Instead, all political activity takes place within what is known as the Movement, a national umbrella political organization to which, in theory, all candidates and voters belong.</p>
        <p>Supporters of a multiple-party electoral system and government say the Movement violates their freedom of association. They also argue that Uganda is fast becoming a one-party state with Mr. Museveni, in power since 1986, having inordinate power.</p>
        <p>That concern was echoed by a group of rich nations -- including the United States and many European nations -- which had contributed $4.5 million for the referendum.</p>
        <p>''The group of donors emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the Movement system does not evolve into a de facto one-party state,'' officials of those nations said in a statement released on Saturday. ''Experience shows that such development would not be in the interest of transparent and accountable government in Uganda.''</p>
        <p>In August 1998, both Rwanda and Uganda helped start a rebellion against President Kabila of Congo, backing three competing rebel groups at various times.</p>
        <p>On Mr. Kabila's side, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have joined in the fighting. Last summer, Uganda and Rwanda turned on each other in the northeastern city of Kisangani -- and they have now clashed three times, all but destroying their once-close relationship.</p>
        <p>The two nations had vowed to leave Kisangani, to make way for United Nations peacekeepers. But it was only after the latest round of fighting between Uganda and Rwanda, which drew criticism from the United Nations as well as the United States, that the two nations actually withdrew their troops from Kisangani. Both still have troops inside Congo.</p>
        <p>In the statement, the two nations ''reaffirmed their commitment to a demilitarization of the city of Kisangani and called on other parties to the cease-fire agreement to reciprocate and not take advantage of Rwanda and Uganda's withdrawal from Kisangani.''</p>
