        <p>Pressure? To Kirk and Brady Boese, it is a word missing from their sixth-grade vocabulary list.</p>
        <p>The Boeses, towheaded twins, are the only sixth graders at the Bloomfield School in the Montana plains, 247 miles from the Billings airport and 27 from the nearest McDonald's.

        <p>Kirk and Brady Boese  Bloomfield School</p>
        <p>Pressure? To Kirk and Brady Boese, it is a word missing from their sixth-grade vocabulary list.</p>
        <p>The Boeses, towheaded twins, are the only sixth graders at the Bloomfield School in the Montana plains, 247 miles from the Billings airport and 27 from the nearest McDonald's. Since kindergarten, their classroom has been the same white clapboard building, shared this year with 11 other children, ages 6 to 14.</p>
        <p>''This year in school, I was just a lot more relaxed,'' said Brady, who is older but smaller than his brother.</p>
        <p>''Sixth grade is easier,'' Kirk, top, agreed. ''There's so little changes in Bloomfield. We haven't even moved our desks.''</p>
        <p>For Kirk and Brady, who are 12, this was the year Dad -- who also went to Bloomfield -- taught them to hunt, for white-tailed deer, and let them drive the pickup around the 2,000-acre wheat farm. They rarely have homework, leaving afternoons a carefree mix of shooting hoops and tidying their collection of Minnesota Twins and Timberwolves paraphernalia. Friday and Saturday nights, they go golfing.</p>
        <p>As for peer pressure, well, they don't really have peers.</p>
        <p>''There's not really an oddball,'' Brady explained. ''If you play basketball and you're good at it, you fit in.''</p>
        <p>Next year, though, the Boeses plan to commute 20 miles to a school in Richey, the nearest town, so they can play sports. There, they'll be part of a class of six.</p>
        <p>Both Boese boys are good students, but their only thoughts of college come when watching N.C.A.A. games on satellite television. Cedric Boese, their father, has warned the twins that the farm could never support two families -- they will have to seek other jobs, probably somewhere else. Still, the boys' musings on the future are vague and childlike.</p>
        <p>''Just see different places,'' Brady shrugged.</p>
        <p>''Instead of just cows and dogs,'' Kirk added.</p>
        <p>''See the ocean again,'' Brady said. ''Instead of just farmland.''</p>
