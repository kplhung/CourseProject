        <p>After nearly three days spent clinging to debris, 10 survivors were rescued on Sunday from a passenger ferry crammed with nearly 500 people that sank off an Indonesian island last week, officials said.</p>
        <p>The survivors, the only people found so far, were recovered in waters off tiny Karakelong islet, about 125 miles northeast of Manado, the port city where rescue operations were based.</p>
        <p>The six men and four women were exhausted, dehydrated and sunburned, said Udiyanto, the chief of the National Search and Rescue Agency's monitoring center in Manado, in North Sulawesi Province.</p>
        <p>''They were clinging to debris from the ship, and only some of them were wearing life jackets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rescuers also removed the body of one passenger who was part of the survivor group but later died, Mr. Udiyanto said.</p>
        <p>More than 480 other passengers are still missing, and the survivors said they feared that the rest must have gone down with the ferry and drowned, Mr. Udiyanto said.</p>
        <p>The survivors said the wooden hulled boat capsized on Thursday afternoon after its captain radioed that it was taking on water in a storm off the the island of Sulawesi, about 1,440 miles northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.</p>
        <p>The rescue ship picked up the survivors more than 60 miles north of where contact with the ferry, the Cahaya Bahari, was lost, and nearly 75 miles from shore.</p>
        <p>Navy ships steamed north on Sunday evening toward the southern Philippines hoping to find more survivors when rescue operations resume at daybreak today, said an official at the sea communications monitoring center in Manado.</p>
        <p>The ferry had set sail on Wednesday from the far eastern Maluku islands with 492 passengers and crew, most of whom were refugees fleeing fighting between Muslims and Christians.</p>
        <p>The ferry was licensed to carry about 250 passengers, Indonesian search and rescue officials said.</p>
        <p>More than 2,500 people have died in an 18-month sectarian war that prompted President Abdurrahman Wahid of Indonesia to declare a civil emergency there a week ago. In addition, tens of thousands of homes, buildings and places of worship have been destroyed.</p>
        <p>Military and police units have been unable or unwilling to stop the violence, and in some cases have joined the fighting, depending on their religious affiliation.</p>
        <p>About 290 passengers aboard the Cahaya Bahari were Christians who had survived an attack by Muslims on June 19 on the main island of Halmahera.</p>
        <p>As many as 180 people were killed in that attack, the worst massacre of the conflict.</p>
        <p>More than 300,000 others have fled their homes since January 1999, setting off fears of a humanitarian disaster and prompting calls from Washington and the Vatican for the Jakarta government to stop the violence.</p>
        <p>The scores of relatives who have gathered at the Manado airport awaiting news of the ferry were stricken on Sunday by the confirmation that the ferry had actually sunk.  ''Until now we had been praying that the ship was still afloat,'' John Girobus, whose mother was on board, told The Associated Press. ''Now we know it has sunk and only a few people have been rescued.''</p>
