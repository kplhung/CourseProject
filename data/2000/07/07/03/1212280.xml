        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After 25 years, my husband and I, who live in Houston, decided to treat ourselves to a visit to New York. We made reservations at the Plaza, packed our clothes and drove north. The World Trade Center was looming on the horizon when I realized I was still in travel jeans. ''I can't go into the Plaza dressed like this,'' I wailed. My obliging husband steered into a service station. I grabbed an overnight bag, darted into the restroom, ripped off jeans and sneakers, donned navy suit, silk blouse, heels.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>After 25 years, my husband and I, who live in Houston, decided to treat ourselves to a visit to New York. We made reservations at the Plaza, packed our clothes and drove north. The World Trade Center was looming on the horizon when I realized I was still in travel jeans. ''I can't go into the Plaza dressed like this,'' I wailed. My obliging husband steered into a service station. I grabbed an overnight bag, darted into the restroom, ripped off jeans and sneakers, donned navy suit, silk blouse, heels.</p>
        <p>Later, we pulled up at the hotel's front entrance. As my husband negotiated with liveried doormen, I pushed my way through the door into the lobby, as elegant as I remembered it. Violin music wafted from the Palm Court. The guests? Attired in jeans and cutoffs, they looked more like delegates to a hobo convention than visitors to an expensive hotel. The only person who was properly dressed was a man with a badge pinned to his blazer pocket. Hurrying over, he thrust an envelope at me and snapped, ''Take this to the manager's office and then, for heaven's sake, go get your name tag.''</p>

        <p>A correspondent enjoyed the sign posted at the refreshment center and newsstand at the Kings County Courthouse in Brooklyn. It reads: ''WARNING: The surgeon general has determined that the top newspapers are not dangerous to your health.''</p>
        <p>MONDAY MORNING UNDERGROUND</p>
        <p>Every Monday it's the same old thing</p>
        <p>A race to the subways where the seat is king.</p>
        <p>Gulp down some coffee . . . start on the way</p>
        <p>Everyone's equal . . . we're commuters today!</p>
        <p>Hit the sidewalks with a steady stride</p>
        <p>Meld into the masses and stride side by side.</p>
        <p>Into the subways we charge with the pack</p>
        <p>The express train's coming . . . we race to the track.</p>
        <p>''Step aside and let them off!''</p>
        <p>The conductor commands with a snort and a cough.</p>
        <p>Then like a river that's over its banks</p>
        <p>We burst through the doors, grab a seat and give thanks.</p>
        <p>Usually accorded the swift or the bold</p>
        <p>A seat is a prize more precious than gold.</p>

        <p>Linda Sterling received a frantic call from a cousin at St. Vincents Hospital. She asked for a particular inspirational book to read before her operation, scheduled for that afternoon. Barnes &amp; Noble at Sixth Avenue and 21st Street had the book but delivery wasn't possible that quickly. When the circumstances were explained, the saleswoman said she lived near St. Vincents and would deliver the book herself on her way home. Ms. Sterling explained that that, unfortunately, would be too late, at which point the saleswoman said she would telephone the hospital and read some of the book to the patient. She spent the next half-hour doing just that. When Ms. Sterling's cousin returned to her room after surgery, the book was awaiting her, together with a second book on the same topic, inscribed from her new friend and a group of her Barnes &amp; Noble colleagues.</p>
        <p>Fran Blazer got two shows for the price of one last month. She was well ahead of curtain time for her Broadway show and stopped at the corner of 45th where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue. It was early evening and in the middle of the intersection, a man was on one knee, proposing to his girlfriend. That accomplished, obviously with an acceptance, he placed a ring on her finger and kissed her. A mounted policeman passing by stopped traffic and another police officer on foot took the couple's camera and snapped their picture. The happy couple then went on their way, Ms. Blazer went on to her show, the policeman trotted off and traffic resumed. The whole thing took place within the space of minutes.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Wolf Chanoff, my 2-year-old godson, and I first spotted the duck the morning after a rainstorm in mid-June. He was standing on the corner of 11th Street and Greenwich Avenue. He was not really a very pretty duck, and he didn't do very much, like quack and waddle -- which was the least Wolf was expecting from a real duck -- but people seemed to go gaga over him. It was early on a workday, but the duck gathered a concerned crowd. Bread crumbs were offered, water was fetched, calls were made. Meanwhile passers-by would stop and seemingly keep vigil as if the idea of spending time with the duck before he was captured was important. Or they would just hang out with the duck, kind of communing with nature. Wildlife at large in the West Village.</p>
        <p>The duck, clearly an urban creature, then moved to Washington Street between Bank and Perry. Wolf saves the soft inside of his morning bagel to feed him; he's not the only one. The neighborhood seems to be bonding over this duck. We discuss where he might have come from, how he got here and why he stays, as well as what he's eating and what will become of him. Every day there are missions where the duck is officially stalked with a big net. This happens while we watch, knowing it's best for the duck if he gets caught but fretting that the rescuers will be successful and take him uptown to Central Park. Every time the duck escapes the net and manages to fly away, there's a kind of silent cheer. Wolf shrieks, ''Duck, fly away.'' And I do myself, of course.</p>

        <p>Ronee Roffe is reconciled to the fact that her 3 1/2-year-old granddaughter, Rebecca, will probably never be a farmer. Rebecca and her father recently went out to the family's tiny patch of green to plant seedlings. That evening, on the phone, Mrs. Roffe asked Rebecca what she had done that day. ''We were outside planting,'' she replied. ''What did you plant?'' Mrs. Roffe asked. ''Groceries,'' Rebecca said.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>One more button story: After my family migrated to this country in 1938, one of my first jobs was working in a button factory -- dipping buttons. To supplement the family income, I took home ''homework.'' On steamy summer nights, the family went up to the roof, equipped with a floor lamp with a long extension cord to be plugged in at our apartment. Then we dipped buttons. The more buttons we dipped, the more money we made. The buttons were white and one part of the button was held between your fingers and the bottom part was dipped in various colors of paint to achieve a two-tone effect. The most memorable buttons were white with a stamped red emblem we made for the New York World's Fair in 1939.</p>
