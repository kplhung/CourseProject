        <p>Close on the heels of the Supreme Court's latest ruling against officially sponsored prayer at public schools, the Colorado State Board of Education is expected to pass a resolution on Thursday that encourages public schools to display the national motto ''In God we trust.''</p>
        <p>The measure would be nonbinding, and its leading proponent, the board chairman, said it highlighted ''civic virtue.'' But the effort has drawn criticism as yet another attempt to bring religion into the classroom in Colorado, even though courts have ruled that the motto's appearance on United States currency does not violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which defines the constitutional principle of separation of church and state.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, state lawmakers considered a measure that would have required the posting of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms and the observation of a moment of silence at the start of each school day. The measure was withdrawn when it became clear that it would not pass, even after it was amended to remove all references to God and the commandments and to recommend only a moment of silence.</p>
        <p>Even after the state measure failed, local religious leaders took up the cause, organizing a rally in support of the effort. The bill's sponsor, State Senator John Andrews, a Republican from Englewood, said he might introduce another Ten Commandments measure next year.</p>
        <p>''Every time 'God' is involved in something, it's always tied to religion,'' said Clair Orr of Kersey, Colo., the education board's chairman and the sponsor of the measure. ''It has gotten so out of balance in that perspective that the establishment clause has sterilized the public domain for anything that has to do with God.''</p>
        <p>Three states -- South Dakota, Indiana and Kentucky -- have passed laws this year allowing schools to post the Ten Commandments in larger displays that include other historical or religious documents. And in Alabama last month, Roy S. Moore, a judge who won fame for defending the display of the Ten Commandments in his courtroom, won the Republican primary for chief justice of the state Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>But nowhere has the public display of the commandments or the motto been promoted more passionately than in Colorado, where many state officials say the mass killings at Columbine High School 15 months ago symbolized the moral breakdown of American society. While no one has argued that the two teenage gunmen would have been deterred by a likeness of the Ten Commandments in a Columbine hallway, many people contend that by displaying the commandments and words like ''In God we trust,'' schools would have a chance to reinforce precepts of moral rectitude. The issue has nothing to do with religion, they say.</p>
        <p>''Columbine has certainly caused us to take a closer look at the relationship between values and culture and our society,'' said Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who supports posting the Ten Commandments in public schools if it is voluntary. Rebutting those who say such displays draw religion into the classroom, he said the displays reflected simple Judeo-Christian values that have been embraced by Americans since the country was founded.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes we run the risk of moving so far away from the values that helped make this country great,'' Governor Owens said. ''The neutrality issue of God should not be required.''</p>
        <p>Yet opponents of posting the Ten Commandments and the national motto in classrooms argue that those who assert the words are nonreligious are naive or disingenuous.</p>
        <p>Gully Stanford of Denver, the only Democrat on the seven-member state education board and an opponent of Mr. Orr's resolution, said the use of the words ''In God we trust'' in the schools ''potentially alienates'' followers of other religions, like Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists, as well as atheists and agnostics. ''To promote one religion while ignoring others with a marquee slogan trivializes the issue to the point it becomes offensive,'' Mr. Stanford said.</p>
        <p>He added that he thought schools had a responsibility to teach the role of religion and moral behavior in history and civics classes. ''But to do it this way, by issuing a proclamation,'' he said, ''is not the way to go.''</p>
        <p>The words ''In God we trust'' first appeared on American currency when they were put on the two-cent piece in 1864 after the treasury secretary, Salmon P. Chase, received a letter from a Pennsylvania clergyman asking that ''the Almighty God'' be recognized in some way on United States coins. Chase took the request to Congress, which passed legislation that President Abraham Lincoln signed.</p>
        <p>Almost 100 years later, on July 30, 1956, another law confirmed ''In God we trust'' as ''the national motto'' -- even though Congress also recognized the Latin phrase ''E pluribus unum'' (out of many, one), which also appears on United States currency, as a national motto.</p>
        <p>In the last four decades, three federal appeals courts have found that the use of ''In God we trust'' on United States currency does not violate the establishment clause. But seeking to remove the motto in an appeal of the most recent case to the Supreme Court, Robert R. Tiernan, a Denver lawyer, said that one of the appeals courts erred in 1996 by interpreting the motto as ''ceremonial deism'' that does not convey governmental endorsement of religion.</p>
        <p>Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit organization, said the proposal was clearly an effort to inject religion into public schools and would not survive a constitutional challenge.</p>
        <p>''This is different from the challenge about coins,'' said Mr. Lynn, who is both a lawyer and a minister in the United Church of Christ. ''In those cases, the courts ruled that because money is so commonly used, the motto has lost any religious significance. Posting 'In God we trust' in public schools gives it a different and new use for the promotion of religious ideas. To me, that new use spells 'unconstitutional.' ''</p>
