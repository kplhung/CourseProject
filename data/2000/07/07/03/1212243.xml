        <p>Those who contend anything can be found on the Web may be right. A Maryland couple just found a giant panda for themselves.</p>
        <p>Bruce and Iresha Fletcher of Chevy Chase were the winning bidders in an online auction to ''adopt'' Mei Shiang, a 2-year-old giant panda that lives in the Wolong Nature Reserve in China. For their $6,100, the couple will receive a year's worth of e-mail and videos on their ward's progress. The money goes to the Wolong Panda Research Center.</p>
        <p>Why adopt a panda? ''The U.S. and China are the two powers in the world, and hopefully a program like this can help relations,'' Mr. Fletcher explained last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fletcher's hope is certainly shared by Twinbays International, which sponsored the auction. Twinbays was formed in April 1999 to sell Chinese goods to Americans but now hooks up American manufacturers with Chinese suppliers. Last Thursday, Twinbays held a reception in Washington for Chinese officials and Virginia venture capitalists to honor the Fletchers and to introduce itself in its new guise.</p>
        <p>Although Twinbays has headquarters in Reston, Va., the company employs only 20 people there; it has 40 people in China. ''It's necessary that we show our respect for the Chinese environment,'' Martin David, president of Twinbays, said of the panda promotion. ''The auction cost us a small fortune, but it's cheaper than buying full-page ads.''</p>
