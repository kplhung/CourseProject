        <p>Armed with a spade, a $10 pine sapling and a video camera, Marvin Stabler of Richboro, Pa., descended a terraced dirt path today to take part in an age-old ritual for Jewish tourists: planting a tree in Israel.</p>
        <p>Sweating in the noon sun, Mr. Stabler hacked at the rocky soil of his chosen patch of Holy Land, wondering aloud if there was not ''someone you could pay to do it for you.'' His family, who came here for his daughter Gabrielle's bat mitzvah, urged him to do his imitation of his grandfather while he dug.</p>
        <p>''Oy vay! Oy gevalt!'' he said, using a thick Yiddish accent, to the great amusement of two boys from Alabama who wore ''Super Jew'' T-shirts. ''This has got to be a first -- me digging!''</p>
        <p>Though no agronomist, Mr. Stabler could look around him and tell that this hillside in Jerusalem was not the most fertile ground. So it came as no shock to him to learn that most of the saplings planted by his family would not survive.</p>
        <p>Still, it is a fact not advertised by the sponsoring agency, the Jewish National Fund. In fact, 6 of every 10 trees planted at the hilly, arid, un irrigated site here die, a fund spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Last week an Israeli tabloid created a commotion when it ran an investigative article, ''The Great Tree Fraud,'' suggesting that workers cynically uproot the saplings planted by tourists to make way for the next day's busloads.</p>
        <p>The newspaper, Maariv, printed three photographs taken from the same vantage point on two consecutive days in late June. One showed tourists busy at work surrounded by dozens of freshly planted trees, the second showed the same site nude but pockmarked, supposedly on the next morning, and the third revealed a nearby pile of uprooted saplings.</p>
        <p>Many Israelis said life was imitating art. The tree-planting ritual, a deeply rooted phenomenon in the culture of the Jewish diaspora, has long been the subject of satirists. A well-known Israeli film, ''Salah Shabati,'' features a scene in which the dedication plaque at the entrance to a forest is changed when one group of American Jewish benefactors leaves and another arrives to see ''their'' trees.</p>
        <p>But Jewish National Fund officials were not amused. Late last week, the fund suspended several workers, and today it established a public investigation committee headed by a former judge.</p>
        <p>Officials said they would be horrified to learn that the charges were true, but that if they were, they would represent an isolated case of malfeasance. In a statement prepared by a public relations firm in New York, the fund defended its good intentions and declared that it would file a libel suit against Maariv for maligning the organization.</p>
        <p>Established in 1901 in Switzerland to purchase land in Palestine, the Jewish National Fund is the second-largest landowner in Israel, after the government. Its tree-planting program long epitomized the Zionist enterprise in its ambition to make the desert bloom.</p>
        <p>''J.N.F. views its afforestation program as its crowning achievement and respects each and every planter,'' the statement from the fund said. ''Many tourists who years earlier had planted saplings have returned to visit the section where they planted their trees. These tourists have expressed to us in moving letters, which we preserve and treasure, their excitement in seeing the saplings that have grown into mature trees.''</p>
        <p>Still, the fund's spokeswoman here, Orly Doron, acknowledges that many saplings planted at the Jerusalem site are routinely removed by workers because they do not survive. That does not take away from the program's track record, she said: 80,000 trees are successfully planted by tourists every year, out of 2.5 million planted by the Jewish National Fund.</p>
        <p>But it is not a point that the fund's literature or representatives make clear to the tourists who pay $10 to honor or memorialize a relative with a tree in Israel.</p>
        <p>''The important thing is that the experience itself means so much to people, and that their contribution helps support the enterprise -- $50 million worth of plantation a year,'' said Ms. Doron. ''If Orly Doron pays $10 to plant a tree, and then it dies, and a worker takes it out and plants a new one, that is not the important thing.''</p>
        <p>Judging by today's crowd at the planting site near Hadassah-Ein Kerem Hospital, that is indeed the tourists' sentiment. All the same, they said they found it a little silly that the reality was not made clearer to them.</p>
        <p>Cathy Swerdlin from Atlanta spent a substantial chunk of time not only planting her sapling but landscaping it with the bounteous rocks in the area. It was clear that she had bonded with the flimsy little tree. And like many thousands of tourists before her, she chose to believe that it would grow to be a mighty pine, her personal, hands-on contribution to Israel.</p>
        <p>Her 18-year-old son, Ryan, said, ''If 40 percent are going to survive, that's all right for us.'' Still, he looked disappointed as he heard about the Jewish National Fund's statistics. At other planting sites, outside Jerusalem, in better soil, the survival rate is much higher -- close to 95 percent. But the the convenient Hadassah-Ein Kerem site is the most popular.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman, the leader of their congregation in Georgia, called over a worker with a green garden hose to bless the Swerdlin's tree with water. Without knowing anything about the Maariv article, Rabbi Goodman said, ''Chances are, they pull them out and plant them again when the next group shows up.''</p>
        <p>Then he winced. ''Oh, don't write that down,'' he said. ''They'll take away my rabbinical credentials.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Write that even if they do pull them out, the J.N.F. will prosper. And it's a great activity. The average youngster who comes here has very little experience with dirt. It gives them a sense of what the pioneers did.''</p>
        <p>Recently, the fund has been battling criticism that goes much deeper than that published in Maariv, part of which suggests that Israel might be better off if the pine saplings did not take root.</p>
        <p>In a petition to the High Court, the Union for Environmental Defense has challenged the Jewish National Fund's method of operations, contending that the organization is subject to only minimal governmental and public scrutiny.</p>
        <p>The group has also criticized the fund's forestry practices, from its supposed overreliance on highly flammable pine trees to accusations that it overuses toxic herbicides and that it has used controlled burning to eliminate unwanted brush.</p>
        <p>Ms. Doron, the spokeswoman, dismisses such criticism by attacking the environmentalists. ''They are very radical,'' she said. ''This is a group that says everything that is not natural is wrong. For example, foresting is wrong.''</p>
        <p>In response, Philip Warburg, the environmental group's deputy director, said, ''The J.N.F. should get out of the business of maligning others and look inward in a constructive manner at forestry practices that have gone unquestioned for too long.''</p>
