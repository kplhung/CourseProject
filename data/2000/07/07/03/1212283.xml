        <p>There were buses to hire, fliers to post, people to rally. The country's newest opposition party was about to be set in motion in Rufaro Stadium and time was running out.</p>

        <p>There were buses to hire, fliers to post, people to rally. The country's newest opposition party was about to be set in motion in Rufaro Stadium and time was running out.</p>
        <p>The party had no slogan, no logo and no access to the television or radio controlled by the very government it hoped to topple. ''We were all anxious,'' recalled Grace Kwinjeh, a member of the party's executive board. ''We were asking ourselves, 'How do we get people there? How do we get the information out?' ''</p>
        <p>But to the surprise of many onlookers, thousands flocked to the township stadium for that first rally last September. And within nine months, the new party, the Movement for Democratic Change, had united black union activists and white corporate executives, students and workers into a formidable movement that shook the political establishment.</p>
        <p>In the elections on June 24 and 25, voters here loosened President Robert Mugabe's grip on Parliament by electing opposition party members to more than a third of the seats. Mr. Mugabe's governing party kept its majority, but for the first time in more than a decade, it lost its authority to change the Constitution unilaterally.</p>
        <p>By almost any measure, the success of the Movement for Democratic Change is astounding. And its rapid rise to power reflects its attentiveness to the frustrations of urban voters at a time when Mr. Mugabe and his party, who have ruled this country for 20 years, seemed detached from the needs of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Morgan Tsvangirai, 48, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, promised to improve the economy, race relations and the prospects for young people, a message that appealed to a nation experiencing an economic crisis, a generation shift and an increasing sense of alienation among whites.</p>
        <p>He put young people in prominent positions and adopted slogans that borrowed from popular township slang. He referred to whites as his ''cousins'' and offered them leadership roles in the party. And he emphasized over and over again that his party intended to find a way to reduce unemployment and skyrocketing inflation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mugabe, 76, who was considered a hero for fighting to end decades of white minority rule here and a master of the art of politics, never seemed to notice that the nation was changing under his feet.</p>
        <p>He focused on the redistribution of white-owned farms to landless blacks in a country that was increasingly urban and preoccupied with joblessness and falling wages.</p>
        <p>He emphasized the history of the liberation struggle when about a third of the population now consists of young people who were either children in 1980, when majority rule was won, or were born shortly after. (Mr. Mugabe helped lead the battle against white rule that led to this country's first democratic elections 20 years ago.)</p>
        <p>He attacked the tiny white minority, which still controls much of the economy, and shook them out of political hibernation. It was, in large measure, Mr. Mugabe's inflammatory racial rhetoric and his support of violent invasions of white-owned farms that persuaded many whites to bankroll the new opposition party.</p>
        <p>And last year, while inflation was soaring and civil servants were struggling to feed their families, Mr. Mugabe gave his cabinet members salary increases of up to 182 percent.</p>
        <p>It is not that Zimbabwe has never had opposition parties. The party of Joshua Nkomo, the prominent nationalist, won 20 seats in Parliament in 1980 before it was absorbed by Mr. Mugabe's party in 1987.</p>
        <p>Since then, the governing party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front, has controlled all but three seats in Parliament. And voters became so apathetic that only about 10 percent voted in the local elections last year.</p>
        <p>''People got tired of a one-party state, but they were never really accorded an alternative,'' said Alfred Nhema, the chairman of political science at the University of Zimbabwe. ''And then, the M.D.C. comes along as a real alternative.'' Mr. Tsvangirai, the country's most important union leader, already had a strong record of challenging the government. He brought the nation to a halt in 1997 with a general strike. And he led the battle for higher wages and lower taxes.</p>
        <p>The opposition candidates also appealed to the public. They were teachers, butchers, lawyers and students who lacked political experience but understood ordinary hardships and were willing to risk their lives for change.</p>
        <p>During the campaign, at least 26 people were killed, most of them opposition party supporters. But the opposition candidates fought on, even though they lacked access to government-controlled news media or public financing, which supports established parties.</p>
        <p>''I screwed up my courage,'' said Benni Tumbare Mutasa, 44, a newly elected member of Parliament who runs a butcher shop and was attacked by supporters of Mr. Mugabe. ''It was high risk, but sometimes risks are worth taking.''</p>
        <p>In the end, nearly 60 percent of registered voters turned out for the  election. And when it was all over, the new opposition party had claimed 57 seats and Mr. Mugabe's party had won 62.</p>
        <p>Emboldened by their unprecedented showing, the opposition did not hesitate to turn their slingshots on the giant of Zimbabwean politics, Mr. Mugabe. And Mr. Tsvangirai announced that he would run for president in 2002.</p>
        <p>''This is the end of Robert Mugabe,'' Mr. Tsvangirai said. ''The sooner they start planning his retirement the better.''</p>
