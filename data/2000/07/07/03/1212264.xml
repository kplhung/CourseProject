        <p>In an effort to reward its brightest technologists, Microsoft plans to announce today that it has created a distinguished engineer program, initially honoring 16 of the company's best designers.</p>
        <p>Similar programs are already in place at Cisco Systems, I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Xerox as a way to reward engineers and scientists who might otherwise leave research and development jobs for management positions with greater financial rewards.</p>
        <p>In an electronic mail message sent to Microsoft employees on Friday, the Microsoft chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, wrote, ''These appointments underscore Microsoft's commitment to our technical people as key partners in the leadership of the company.''</p>
        <p>The position entitles the Microsoft researchers to a financial reward package that is similar to that received by the company's vice presidents, said Deborah Willingham, the company's vice president for human resources.</p>
        <p>''We were trying to be sure that great technical people know that they have the opportunity to achieve the recognition that vice presidents receive inside the company,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The company will add approximately four or five employees to the list each year, she added.</p>
        <p>For Charles Thacker, a former Xerox and Digital Equipment engineer who joined Microsoft three years ago and is now involved in the company's effort to develop a tablet-like computer, the program will have little effect on his day-to-day work activities.</p>
        <p>He said the program will principally be of value because it will chart a path for technical employees at the company, which now has a work force of more than 38,000.</p>
        <p>''It demonstrates to the technical people that you can stay on the technical ladder,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Thacker, who is the co-inventor of the Ethernet office networking technology, those to be named distinguished engineers include Butler Lampson, Charles Simonyi, Jim Gray and David Cutler. All are well-known scientists and engineers who have helped the company pursue advanced computer technologies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cutler, for example, came from Digital Equipment to lead a team at Microsoft that developed the Windows NT operating system beginning in 1988.</p>
        <p>The others who received appointments as distinguished engineers are Mark Lucovsky, Wael Bahaa-el-Din, Anders Hejlsberg, Antoine Leblond, Suryanarayanan Raman, Darryl Rubin, Brad Lovering, Lou Perazzoli, Michael Toutonghi, Peter Spiro and Mohsen al-Ghosein.</p>
