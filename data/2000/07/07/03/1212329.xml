        <p>Re ''Playing 'Catch and Grope' in the Schoolyard'' (Editorial Observer, June 26):</p>
        <p>For centuries, little boys have done the following to little girls: dipped their pigtails into inkwells, chased them on the playground, grabbed their headbands and run away. And for those same centuries, when the little girls told of these actions, their mothers would smile and say, ''That means he likes you.'' Too many girls get an early message that there is something flattering about assault.</p>
        <p>While there is a long way from pigtail dipping to assaults in Central Park, it's time for mothers to break this cycle. They should teach their daughters that aggressive physical behavior of any sort is not to be welcomed, encouraged or tolerated.</p>
