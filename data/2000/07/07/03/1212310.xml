        <p>Listen. Those sounds you hear are the first faint glorious notes from the film ''Jazz,'' Ken Burns's wonderful 10-part, 19-hour exploration of this nation's greatest music. The documentary will debut on PBS in January, but last week I got an early look at some excerpts and they're amazing.</p>
        <p>I once asked Dizzy Gillespie how close he had really been to Charlie Parker. He replied, ''How close are two coats of paint?''</p>
        <p>That's how I feel about the relationship between this country and the astonishing variety of music that we call jazz. Jazz is more than a musical reflection of America -- it is the embodiment in music of the quintessentially American idea of free and talented and diverse individuals working, playing, frequently fighting, but most of all improvising together to come up with something beautiful and great. It is the truest artistic expression of who we are.</p>
        <p>Ken Burns has captured this on film.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns himself, in a telephone conversation a few days ago, said: ''I think it's the best thing I've ever done. I've never said that before in any of my interviews. Ever.''</p>
        <p>''Jazz'' is the third part of the trilogy of American life that Mr. Burns began 16 years ago when he started work on his acclaimed ''Civil War'' series. The second part was the epic 18 1/2-hour ''Baseball'' documentary.</p>
        <p>For once, a film about jazz does not give the music short shrift. The music is abundant and it's thrilling. But there is also much more. With remarkable footage -- 2,000 archival film clips and 2,400 still photos -- ''Jazz'' carries the viewer on a spellbinding tour of the personalities and the venues (the speakeasies, the smoke-filled clubs, the ballrooms, the concert halls) that gave us this extraordinary music.</p>
        <p>''Jazz is the story of the 20th century,'' said Mr. Burns. ''It's an unusually objective witness to what we've been through -- two world wars, massive dislocations in the Depression, the ever-present question of race, that is to say, minstrelsy and Jim Crow and lynchings and all of that. And it's about sex, the way men and women talk to one another, the mating call of America. And it's about drugs and their terrible cost. But mostly it's about these terribly courageous men and women who created art on the spot -- something the rest of us can only dream of.''</p>
        <p>Among the people you meet on this 19-hour tour are, in the words of the narrator:</p>
        <p>* ''The pampered son of middle-class parents who turned a whole orchestra of extraordinary musicians into his own personal instrument, wrote nearly 2,000 pieces for it to play, and in the process became America's greatest composer.'' (That would be Duke Ellington.)</p>
        <p>* ''A Russian-Jewish immigrant's boy from the Chicago slums who was taught the clarinet just to keep him out of trouble, but who grew up to teach a whole country how to dance.'' (Benny Goodman.)</p>
        <p>* ''The troubled daughter of a Baltimore housemaid whose distinctive style of singing transcended the limitations of her own voice and routinely transformed mediocre music into great art.'' (Billie Holiday.)</p>
        <p>* ''The son of a pullman chef from Kansas City, Mo., who came to New York to launch a musical revolution, proudly led it for a time, and then destroyed himself at 34.'' (Charlie Parker.)</p>
        <p>* ''The fatherless waif from the streets of New Orleans whose unrivaled genius helped turn jazz into a soloist's art [and] who influenced every singer, every instrumentalist, every artist who came after him.'' (Louis Armstrong.)</p>
        <p>There is a moment in the film when the actor Ossie Davis describes walking in on Louis Armstrong unexpectedly and seeing ''the saddest expression I've ever seen on a man's face.'' And there is a moment when Dave Brubeck, reminiscing on camera, is suddenly overcome by an ancient and horrible memory, and he breaks down and begins to weep.</p>
        <p>With taste, and with his own sure and unerring artistic touch, Mr. Burns guides us through this sacred cultural terrain. No one has ever put jazz on film better than Ken Burns.</p>
        <p>Kudos must go to PBS and to the folks who carry the General Motors ''Mark of Excellence'' banner for sponsoring this important work. I seldom look forward to January. But this is different. This is really special.</p>
