        <p>As collectors and dealers gathered here last week for Christie's and Sotheby's big sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the auction houses' legal troubles in the United States seemed to make no difference to the buyers. Still, it was clear that the shadow cast by the federal antitrust investigation in New York had crossed the Atlantic. At the same moment on Tuesday night that Sotheby's was holding its important sale of Impressionist and modern art at its Bond Street headquarters here, Christie's was conducting its auction of contemporary art just a few blocks away on King Street.</p>
        <p>Such scheduling conflicts never happened in the past when the two companies met openly to plan the year's auctions. But with prosecutors investigating whether the auction houses fixed prices and questioning every move they make, it was obvious that a message was being not so subtly delivered, even at this distance.</p>
        <p>''We can't talk to each other at all anymore,'' said one top auction house official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other than that, no one in charge offered any explanation.</p>
        <p>As the auctions here progressed, the strong economy gave collectors confidence about the art market, making last week's sales successful for both Sotheby's and Christie's. Prices were consistently high, especially for the rarest, most expensive works. If these sales are any reflection of today's tastes, then Impressionist paintings, sculpture and photography are especially popular. But while prices were strong, few bidders went wild.</p>
        <p>''It's an intelligent market,'' said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments worldwide. ''Nobody got carried away, but at the same time they didn't let the best things go for low prices. There were no bargains.''</p>
        <p>Melanie Clore, a deputy chairman of Sotheby's who runs its Impressionist and modern art department here, defined the market as healthy and controlled. The biggest difference between today and the 1980's boom, she said, is that people now are more discriminating. ''They aren't in a rush. They don't need to buy mediocre material, and there's no absolutely speculative buying.''</p>
        <p>The best works sold for prices consistent with the boom years of the late 1980's. At Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art, for instance, Degas's ''Young Dancer at 14,'' a 1922 posthumous cast of a dancer with a cream-colored silk bodice and a tulle-and-gauze tutu, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $11.5 million, above its $10.9 million low estimate.</p>
        <p>This was the fourth time a 1922 cast of this statue had sold at auction in 12 years. In 1988, at the height of the market, one was included in a sale of art from the estate of William Mayer Goetz, a founder of 20th Century Fox, and his wife, Edith, at Christie's in New York, where it sold to Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the brother of the Sultan of Brunei, for $10.1 million. In 1996 Sotheby's sold another such Degas in New York on behalf of the Shelburne Museum in Vermont for $11.9 million. And in November, Prince Jefri sold his at Sotheby's in New York for $12.3 million.</p>
        <p>Some prices last week exceeded those in the late 80's boom. Monet's ''Beach at Trouville,'' a sun-dappled seascape, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder at Sotheby's on Tuesday night for $16.4 million, well above its $15 million high estimate.  The painting had fetched $10.7 million at the Goetz sale at Christie's in New York 12 years ago.</p>
        <p>A 1942 Matisse, ''Dancer in an Armchair With a Checkered Floor,'' that was expected to bring $3.9 million to $5.4 million at Sotheby's, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $7.4 million. Four people wanted the painting, which shows Carla Avogadro, a dancer who was a friend of the artist, posing in a bright yellow chair against a background of black and white checks. The buyer bid through David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include the auction house's commissions: for Sotheby's it is 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000 and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Christie's charges 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates at both auction houses do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>This season Christie's combined its Impressionist and Post-Impressionist auction with its sale of 20th-century art in one evening, and both areas of the market were strong. Its star painting was Cezanne's ''Still Life With Fruits and a Ginger Pot'' from 1895. It was exhibited in the artist's first retrospective in Paris the year it was painted and later belonged to two famous dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Bruno Cassirer.</p>
        <p>''For Cezanne, who was never satisfied with a painting, this was unusually finished and resolved,'' Mr. Giraud said. Two determined bidders vied for the painting, which ended up selling to William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, for $18.1 million, just at its high estimate.</p>
        <p>Three bidders at Christie's were willing to spend upward of $6 million for Monet's 1894 ''Spring Landscape (Giverny),'' which sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $6.6 million, just above its low estimate of $6 million. A later, more abstract Monet, ''The Japanese Bridge,'' painted between 1918 and 1924, was mightily fought over by two determined telephone bidders. It finally sold to an unidentified bidder for $4.3 million, above its high estimate of $2.2 million.</p>
        <p>One rare and much sought-after painting, a brightly colored Fauve portrait of the artist Jean Metzinger painted by Robert Delaunay in 1906, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.9 million, far above its $2.1 million high estimate. Delaunay, who was better-known as an abstract painter, did few Fauve paintings.  Metzinger is posed at an angle with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and in the background is a Japanese print, reminiscent of the famous van Gogh portrait ''Le Pere Tanguy.</p>
        <p>''When you think of Fauve artists you think of Matisse, Braque, Derain and Vlamink; you don't think of Delaunay,'' Mr. Giraud said. ''So for a collector of Fauve works, this was a great find.''</p>
        <p>At both Sotheby's and Christie's sculptures tended to be popular, as they have for the last year. Works by Rodin, Giacometti and Picasso all brought prices far above their high estimates. One reason was that as the prices of paintings have steadily risen in recent years, sculptures by artists like Matisse, Picasso and Degas have seemed cheap by comparison.</p>
        <p>Among contemporary collectors the same can be said for photographs. Artists like Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Gilbert and George, and Thomas Struth were fought over by a crowd of young, international collectors who were willing to pay any price to take home famous images.  Never mind that these photographs are printed in multiples.</p>
        <p>''In this media-saturated world,  young collectors were raised on images,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. ''They are not concerned with things being unique, they want to know that they have something that is exactly the same as a photograph hanging in the Museum of Modern Art.''</p>
        <p>This group of buyers, Mr. Meyer added, tend to come from the film industry. ''They are completely uninterested in abstract painting. It's a midcentury struggle they have no connection to.''</p>
        <p>Contemporary art in general continued to command high prices, as it did at the big auctions in New York in May. At Christie's sale of 20th-century art, Bacon's ''Study for a Portrait (Man Screaming)'' from 1952 sold for $4.4 million, far above its $2.7 million high estimate. A Jeff Koons, ''Large Vase of Flowers,'' a 1991 polychrome wood bouquet of 140 spring flowers that stands 4 feet 3  inches high and was estimated to sell for $380,000 to $520,000, fetched $994,961. The buyer was identified only as a European collector.</p>
        <p>At Sotheby's a photorealist painting by Gerhard Richter of a view of Corsica with a sailboat in the distance was bought by another unidentified collector for $1.3 million, twice its high $670,00 estimate. Two people fought to take home a late de Kooning, ''Untitled XVII,'' from 1982, an abstraction of bright blues and reds on a white background. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.9 million, more than twice its high $900,000 estimate.</p>
        <p>Experts at both Sotheby's and Christie's noticed an increase in European buyers this season. No longer were the Top 10 works in each sale bought by Americans.</p>
        <p>''The presence of Europeans was a significant change,'' Mr. Meyer said.  ''This is a market fueled by new buyers and new money. It's the economy that drives it.''</p>
