        <p>''La Bayadere'' was created in 1877. ''Theme and Variations'' came seven decades later. But the two works are at heart shining examples of the great glory of pure classical ballet. And the dancers of American Ballet Theater communicated that truth with joyous clarity in performances at the Metropolitan Opera House on Thursday and Friday nights respectively.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera offered an interestingly double-faceted portrait of Nikiya, the frail young temple dancer whose doomed love for the warrior Solor forms the narrative of ''La Bayadere.'' Ms. Herrera's pliant torso subtly suggested Indian classical dancing, each soft twist and tilt registering love, sorrow and anger in Marius Petipa's tale of exotic India, glowingly restaged by Natalia Makarova.</p>

        <p>''La Bayadere'' was created in 1877. ''Theme and Variations'' came seven decades later. But the two works are at heart shining examples of the great glory of pure classical ballet. And the dancers of American Ballet Theater communicated that truth with joyous clarity in performances at the Metropolitan Opera House on Thursday and Friday nights respectively.</p>
        <p>Paloma Herrera offered an interestingly double-faceted portrait of Nikiya, the frail young temple dancer whose doomed love for the warrior Solor forms the narrative of ''La Bayadere.'' Ms. Herrera's pliant torso subtly suggested Indian classical dancing, each soft twist and tilt registering love, sorrow and anger in Marius Petipa's tale of exotic India, glowingly restaged by Natalia Makarova.</p>
        <p>In the famous Kingdom of the Shades pas de deux in the second act, Ms. Herrera became a grand ballerina. Stretched tall, she surged authoritatively through the scene's fast turns and balances, though her occasional snapping finishes distracted from the flow of her dancing. The redoubtable Julio Bocca was her Solor, with Gillian Murphy icy and powerful as the treacherous Gamzatti.</p>
        <p>This has been Mr. Bocca's season. The purity and infectious excitement of his dancing promise to linger long in the memory, as once again he stepped into a role vacated by an injured dancer, this time Angel Corella. Special praise must go to the corps in the second act, whose dancing rightly embodied Baudelaire's ''luxe, calme et volupte.'' Herman Cornejo stood out for the welcome fluency he brought to the hard-dancing Bronze Idol. David Lamarche conducted the Minkus score, performed with enjoyable panache.</p>
        <p>Joaquin De Luz is often cast as rapscallion characters whose cheekiness sometimes conceals the considerable technical demands of the choreography. Mr. De Luz got his chance at elegance in a role debut as the lead male in ''Theme and Variations,'' George Balanchine's glittering, sweeping reinvention of Petipa's classicism. A little short in height for such a part, Mr. De Luz seemed to grow in stature as he negotiated  challenges like a fiendish-looking series of air turns with ease and solemn grandeur.</p>
        <p>Ashley Tuttle brought an unexpected but welcome warmth to her impressively danced ballerina role.  Ermanno Florio conducted the Tchaikovsky score.</p>
