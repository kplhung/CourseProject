        <p>More than a month into what is essentially a new race for the United States Senate, Cathy Harrison and Dave Temkin, both party stalwarts, have just about climbed off the fence of indecision and chosen the candidate they will vote for in November, barring scandal or surprise.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison and Mr. Temkin -- she now set on Representative Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk County and he on Hillary Rodham Clinton -- are part of a panel of nine voters that The New York Times is following as they make their decisions in this pivotal Senate race.</p>
        <p>They were culled from respondents to early New York Times/CBS News Polls, back when Rudolph W. Giuliani was the Republican candidate in the race, the number of undecided voters was unusually small and their indecision was based not on ignorance of the candidates but rather on antipathy for them.</p>
        <p>All that has now changed, with Mayor Giuliani out of the contest because of prostate cancer, and Mrs. Clinton, in the eyes of these voters, a less contentious figure than she was a year ago. But except for Mrs. Harrison and Mr. Temkin (and Tom Beck, a Long Island guidance counselor familiar with Mr. Lazio's record who embraced his candidacy from Day 1), the six other voters continue to watch and wait.</p>
        <p>Tom and Barbara Smith, a struggling working-class couple from Saugerties, say they still do not feel that they know enough about the candidates, partly because they live in a part of the state without the saturation news coverage of New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester or Buffalo.</p>
        <p>Charlene Clinton, a single mother in Buffalo who recently lost her first job since leaving the welfare rolls, says she pays no attention to politics, did not know Mr. Lazio had entered the race and would make up her mind at the last minute, as she always does.</p>
        <p>Other voters on the panel have pet issues that will determine their vote. Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial services concern and a resident of Cortlandt Manor in Westchester, wants to know how each candidate would spend the growing budget surplus.</p>
        <p>Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant on Staten Island whose wife is undergoing experimental cancer treatment, wants a senator who cares about the disease, its causes and its cures. And Bob Harrison, a high school social studies teacher from Amsterdam, who is Cathy's husband, wants to know how Representative Lazio and Mrs. Clinton plan to invigorate the failing upstate economy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison, a nurse and a lifelong Republican, had a hard time supporting Mr. Giuliani, despite party affiliation, because she found him too harsh and autocratic, too focused on downstate concerns and too indelicate in his personal life.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio is another story. ''From what I've been seeing and hearing, I like the family feeling he gives off,'' Mrs. Harrison said. ''He's a Republican candidate and now I don't feel any need to cross over.''</p>
        <p>The choice is also simple now for Mr. Temkin, a telecommunications expert from Flushing, Queens, and a lifelong Democrat. His reservations about Mrs. Clinton remain real, Mr. Temkin said. And he would vote Republican if the candidate had the stature and courage to cross his party when it was in the interest of New York State, as Jacob K. Javits did when he was senator, he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lazio's defining act so far, in Mr. Temkin's mind, was deferring to the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, by abandoning the race in favor of Mr. Giuliani and then jumping back in on command. ''He's too loyal to the party,'' Mr. Temkin concluded.</p>
        <p>All these voters (two of the original group dropped out of the project in May) are learning about the candidates amid the din of their daily lives, generally more compelling than politics. There are gaps in what they know and little spare time to fill them.</p>
        <p>The Smiths, for instance, have been preoccupied with the birth of a grandchild, the search for a new apartment and plans to paint and hang bookshelves. Ms. Clinton, the single mother in Buffalo, lost a job as a monitor at a school that was stripped of its certification. She is back in the bureaucratic maze of welfare and faced with a shut-off notice for an unpaid water bill. The Harrisons just celebrated their son's high school graduation, helped him choose a community college and left for a family vacation in Hawaii, which took two years of savings.</p>
        <p>Still, most of them are aware of certain policy announcements, gaffes and tiffs. They agree that mudslinging, a word used by many, has increased since Mr. Giuliani's withdrawal. They agree that Mrs. Clinton has been more visible in the metropolitan region and less visible upstate, where she has less chance of winning with Mr. Lazio as her opponent. They all are hoping for debates and better elaboration of positions.</p>
        <p>Most of the sniping between the candidates is of no interest, except to  irritate them. The accusations that Mr. Lazio had inappropriately profited from a securities deal, for instance, drew ridicule because equivalent accusations have been made against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''It's posturing and pandering,'' Mr. Temkin said. ''It's like Dr. Strangelove. They're afraid if the other guy does it and they don't. We're not given enough credit for intelligence as voters.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith had a theory on why there was less negative campaigning when the mayor was still in the race. ''Maybe she didn't feel as threatened,'' he said of Mrs. Clinton. ''Lazio is young and energetic and he exploded out of the block. Maybe that shook her up.''</p>
        <p>These voters seem unmoved by the barrage of television advertising. It is tempting to think that they discount the power of the ads because they think that is what sophisticated voters should do. But in nine interviews, only the Harrisons were able even to describe a television commercial for a candidate -- a warm and fuzzy one in which Mr. Lazio is surrounded by his wife and children.</p>
        <p>''Family values and such,'' Mr. Harrison said of the Lazio commercials. ''Upstate, that's a plus.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Lazio's attractive family won over Mrs. Harrison, her husband, who comes from less conservative Republican stock, says he needs something more. ''On the economy, I haven't heard much from either candidate,'' he said. ''That's an important issue up here, to make sure New York State prospers. So I'm waiting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taggart, who has been impressed with Mr. Lazio's energy, is waiting to hear his plans, and Mrs. Clinton's, for the surplus. Large tax cuts, a common Republican lure, would be both foolish and selfish, in Mr. Taggart's view. First, cuts put very little money in any individual's pocket, he said. And second, prosperous times are an opportunity to be magnanimous.</p>
        <p>''One of the ways we define ourselves as a people,'' he said, ''is how we get through the best of times.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, a former schoolteacher, is quick to acknowledge that these days he has become a myopic voter, with only one thing on his mind: his wife's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He has learned on the Internet, from his lymphoma news group, that Mr. Lazio last year won the Paul Tsongas Memorial Award from the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America.</p>
        <p>Normally a Democrat, and aware of Mrs. Clinton's focus on health care issues, he has offered the first lady a chance to weigh in, sending an e-mail message to her campaign office that has not been answered. ''I would like to get her viewpoint,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz is abashed to be so self-centered. ''I do understand there are other issues for other people,'' he said. ''But for us, this is life and death.'' In addition, he said concern about the increased incidence of certain cancers ''branches into respect for the environment and your position regarding corporate power and the responsibility of big business for the mess they create.''</p>
        <p>Charlene Clinton, who has voted in all but one election since she was eligible, has been consistently unaware of campaign developments, including Mr. Giuliani's cancer diagnosis, the announcement of his planned marital separation, his withdrawal from the race and Mr. Lazio's entry.</p>
        <p>In elections past, she has relied on an elderly neighbor, an avid newspaper reader, to keep her informed. Lately, that woman has been ill. In addition, there has been a change of pastors at the Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church. The former paster talked a lot about politics, and the new one does not, Ms. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>She has never voted for a Republican, nor have her parents, Ms. Clinton said. Yet she insisted that she remained undecided. ''I'm not that into politics,'' she said. ''But issues do concern me.''</p>
        <p>Undecided</p>
        <p>This is the sixth article in a series following a group of New York State voters from diverse backgrounds as they make up their minds on which candidate to support for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>The previous articles were about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the race, his separation from his wife, the mayor's prostate cancer, the information already available about the candidates, and the voters' first impressions.</p>
