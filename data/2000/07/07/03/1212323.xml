        <p>The cruel, swirling wind at Giants Stadium, the harsh winters and a desire to be linked forever to their Super Bowl past has meant that the Giants in recent years have remained a pounding, simplistic offensive team. Coach Jim Fassel has labored at loosening that fixation, tossing in more multiple formations and shifting tight ends and four-receiver sets. More screens and draws and trickery. But what the San Francisco 49ers perfected in the last 20 years on offense and what the St. Louis Rams exuded last season in winning the Super Bowl has escaped the Giants.

        <p>The cruel, swirling wind at Giants Stadium, the harsh winters and a desire to be linked forever to their Super Bowl past has meant that the Giants in recent years have remained a pounding, simplistic offensive team. Coach Jim Fassel has labored at loosening that fixation, tossing in more multiple formations and shifting tight ends and four-receiver sets. More screens and draws and trickery. But what the San Francisco 49ers perfected in the last 20 years on offense and what the St. Louis Rams exuded last season in winning the Super Bowl has escaped the Giants. We are talking speed and explosiveness, big plays and points.</p>
        <p>A personality. A presence.</p>
        <p>The Giants simply have not had either, and last season, with a 7-9 record, that shortcoming nearly swallowed them whole. There has long been a testy air among the Giants' offensive and defensive players, a feeling that the defense rules and the offense sleeps. Finger-pointing emerged last season. The Giants' offense needed an infusion of talent and confidence. For Fassel and the team to be ready for the 2000 season, changes were required. And the Giants started at their core.</p>
        <p>They will line up this fall with four changes on the offensive line. Only right guard Ron Stone returns at the same position. This is like dumping the engine in a car or painting a white house a bold red. The building has been gutted. The smoke is clearing. It is all part of a proposed remake of the Giants' offense, one that is supposed to strike more decisively and quickly this season, and yet will pound with the bruising rookie running back, Ron Dayne.</p>
        <p>''This is not something that happens every year in the N.F.L. because consistency on your offensive line is supposed to be a football requirement for success,'' Stone said last month as the Giants concluded their last minicamp before training camp begins this month. ''We've got four changes on the line, and I don't know how you would perceive that. I guess last year we all needed to factor more as a group and obviously we didn't.''</p>
        <p>For much of last season it was Roman Oben at left tackle, Luke Petitgout at left guard, Brian Williams at center, Stone at right guard and Scott Gragg at right tackle. The lineup this season is Lomas Brown, Glenn Parker, Dusty Zeigler, Stone and Petitgout, with the first three players arriving as free agents.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offensive line has been symptomatic of the offense. It was short on grit and fight. Often when things went wrong, the linemen would stroll off the field, heads down and defeated. It was a troublesome signature for an offense on which the leading rusher for the entire season (Joe Montgomery) gained only 348 yards. That was a focal point for a team that scored only 299 points; in comparison, the Rams' league-leading total was 526.</p>
        <p>Brown could play a pivotal role in changing that. Offensive linemen have rarely been glamorous, but the left tackle position is the jewel among common stones. For a right-handed quarterback, the left tackle protects a blind side. The left tackle should be a player bred for battle. And that is Brown.</p>
        <p>He is a rarity: a 37-year-old who is a seven-time Pro Bowl pick and who is entering his 16th pro season. Brown, whom Detroit selected as the sixth player over all in the 1985 draft, blocked for Barry Sanders during 11 seasons with the Lions. In the last four seasons, Brown spent three in Arizona and last season in Cleveland. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighed 305 pounds as a rookie in '85, weighed 275 when he arrived in Arizona in '96 and weighs 280 now. He has had surgery once -- a knee scoped in 1989 -- in his pro career. He is a marvel at that age and experienced at his position. A player of striking wisdom, desire and character.</p>
        <p>Wherever Lomas Brown has been, teammates have sought him.</p>
        <p>''Nearly everywhere I've been, guys have asked me to be their union representative,'' Brown said. ''They come to me with personal problems, financial problems, family problems. It's flattering. But now I am trying to focus more on me. I've been through a divorce. I've had problems with my daughters. Who do I turn to for my problems? Well, I'm turning to me. I am under the microscope now. I'm in the media capital of the world with a team that is asking me to help give this line and this offense some personality and presence.</p>
        <p>''On our schedule this year, I've got ends Bruce Smith of Washington twice, Simeon Rice of Arizona twice, Greg Ellis of Dallas twice. We play Tennessee and I'll see Jevon Kearse. I'll get Cleveland's Courtney Brown, and he was the No. 1 pick in the entire draft this year. I've got some work to do. This is an opportunity for me, a make-or-break year. I get a chance to really project my name out there. If I shut down some people and we win, a lot of things can happen.</p>
        <p>''I have never won a championship in high school, college or the pros. Maybe this is the year I win a championship in the pros, in my 16th year. This could be so very lovely.''</p>
        <p>Or it could all collapse.</p>
        <p>Will the aged veterans Brown and Parker, a four-time Super Bowl player with the Bills, who is 34 and in his 11th year, last the entire season? Have the Giants added enough speed and scoring ability at the skill positions? Will quarterback Kerry Collins glow?</p>
        <p>''The way the league has evolved, the key positions on your offense are the skill-position people, at quarterback, running back and receiver,'' said Jim McNally, the Giants' offensive line coach. ''I don't think you can win with duds on the offensive line, but you can win with average guys there. We're hoping this group will far surpass that.</p>
        <p>''Lomas gives us experience and leadership. He knows how to play the left tackle position. He may not be like he was in his third year or so in the league, but he has played against a number of players and does not get rattled when those fast ends come off the corner.</p>
        <p>''I have been in the league 22 years and had the chance to coach Anthony Munoz at left tackle. I have seen the good times and the bad times for players and teams. You come to work every day and do your job and hope that injuries won't be a big factor.''</p>
        <p>Stone said of Brown: ''Lomas is like a coach. I give to him and I take from him.''</p>
        <p>Brown was told by the Giants' coaches that they wanted him to show the other linemen how to fight.</p>
        <p>''You have to have some dogs up there on the line,'' Brown said. ''When I look at linemen, I look at build and temperament. I think we have some of that. And with Ron Dayne running the ball, he provides the force like an extra lineman. I call him R. D. There is only one Barry Sanders, but R. D. has some of that Barry mystique. He's got some quick feet on him. We've got the receivers and the quarterback. We should be a scoring offense.''</p>
        <p>The Giants are counting on Brown to provide a lift. To help give the team a face lift on offense. ''I am the type of player that even downfield I am there to pick up my running back after a tackle,'' Brown said. ''At practice and in games, I want guys whenever they get tired and feel like they can't push any further to look over at me. I think they'll find me doing the right things.''</p>
        <p>Helping to provide more Giants offensive personality and presence.</p>
        <p>A welcome change.</p>
