        <p>How does Madeleine K. Albright want to be remembered as secretary of state? As Dr. Albright zoomed from country to country, region to region -- 4 hours here, 36 hours there in 9 days -- the legacy question was never far away.</p>
        <p>Part of her mark in history will be as the first woman to hold the post, a role she relishes. In Seoul, South Korea, last week, she emerged from her plane in citrus yellow, a bold look she said was intended as a metaphor for President Kim Dae Jung's ''sunshine policy'' with North Korea. In Berlin,  she was not too shy to tell an audience that she was grateful for cosmetics to help disguise her exhaustion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright has also taken on issues that others may have considered too soft, like the empowerment of women in developing countries and Internet literacy in nations under dictatorships.</p>
        <p>But as Dr. Albright traveled from Beijing to Seoul and on to Warsaw in late June, with an interlude in the Middle East and a drive through the Brandenburg Gate, it was clear that, in the last six months of her term, she wants to concentrate on her vision of democracy.</p>
        <p>Democracy, she said in Warsaw, was her ''lodestar.'' And to emphasize the message, she intends to stay on the road.</p>
        <p>''What we're going to do is keep traveling around the world and have 36-hour days, so six months is nine months,'' she told reporters as her plane headed home last Thursday.</p>
        <p>She has already visited 82 countries since she took office in January 1997, a record for any secretary of state. She plans two trips to Asia this month, and perhaps another in the fall, including a possible stop in Nepal, where she has never been.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright says her travel shows how the job of secretary of state has changed since the end of the cold war. Her predecessors, she says, concentrated largely on the Soviet Union and the Middle East. Since then, there has been an explosion of new countries -- 189 in the United Nations at last count.</p>
        <p>Similarly, foreign policy issues, Dr. Albright likes to say, have expanded beyond traditional questions of arms control and balance of power to international business corruption and illegal immigration. She feels obliged, she suggests, to push United States interests to new corners of the world. And for Dr. Albright, a child of Central Europe whose Czechoslovak parents fled the Communists and arrived in the United States in 1949 to begin a new life, the nurturing of democracy is a prime interest for the United States. (As she bounced from culture to culture during this latest trip, she appeared most at home chatting into the late evening over coffee in Warsaw's old town.)</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of her stay in Poland was a conference that pulled together 107 democracies. But the gathering -- born very much of Dr. Albright's guiding hand -- revealed undertones of resentment at American hegemony.</p>
        <p>That was most stridently expressed by France, which refused to sign the closing statement. But there were criticisms elsewhere, too.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch in New York, whose organization was present in Warsaw, says the promotion of democracy by the United States is useful but is done in such a way that it ''fuels growing hostility.''</p>
        <p>''The United States is increasingly viewed as a government that preaches to the rest of the world but is unwilling to be bound by international standards,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Despite Dr. Albright's efforts, Washington has failed to sign United Nations accords on an international criminal court or on the control of land mines -- largely because the administration and Congress want to immunize American military personnel against international laws imposed on others, and Dr. Albright failed to beat out the Pentagon in internal administration debates.</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright seems to believe that she does best abroad, riding imperial motorcades and speaking unchallenged at a broad variety of forums. There, she is away from the political sniping of Congress and day-to-day management from the National Security Council.</p>
        <p>She finished this last tour of the world in Berlin with a speech on democracy in the Balkans, which dealt with Serbia as a last holdout of repression.</p>
        <p>The secretary began her term rebuking Saddam Hussein. She was one of the strongest advocates within the administration for military strikes and economic sanctions against him, but the Iraqi leader remains in power.</p>
        <p>Since then -- before, during and after the war in Kosovo last year -- she has paid much attention to another repressive leader, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. A year after the NATO air campaign, he, too, remains in power -- much to the evident disappointment of Dr. Albright.</p>
        <p>In Berlin, she reiterated that Mr. Milosevic belongs in The Hague, home of an international tribunal that indicted him on charges of war crimes. ''If Milosevic cared at all about the rule of law,'' she added, ''he would turn himself over to The Hague.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sure he will go,'' she said as she headed home, offering no clear way to achieve that goal beyond what she called a combination of people working inside and outside Serbia, and her opinion that his government is increasingly brittle.</p>
        <p>''Patience is what is necessary,'' she said. ''The calendar is not what we're looking at.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright is keenly aware of her own calendar, however. She was asked whether the Balkans, which have consumed much of her time, would remain a top priority for the next administration. ''It depends on who gets elected,'' she replied, adding, ''No matter where I am, we're not going to forget them.''</p>
