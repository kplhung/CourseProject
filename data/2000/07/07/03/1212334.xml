        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I applaud Bob Herbert's opposition to repealing the estate tax (column, June 26). This tax was intended to limit the creation of dynasties that concentrate great wealth in the hands of the few. There are still powerful social arguments in favor of placing limits on dynasty building. However, as we all know, a million dollars is no longer a million dollars. We should double the exemption amounts now being put into effect and review the impact periodically with an eye to further exemption increases.</p>
