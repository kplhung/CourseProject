        <p>When magazine publishers and chief executives of media companies discuss the latest problem facing the magazine industry, they use words like ''passion,'' ''devastation'' and ''death.''</p>
        <p>Executives who usually favor brevity will spend an hour in conversation detailing the potential ''horror'' of the crisis. The feared trauma is such that magazine publishers have been cruising the halls of Congress for the last five months, spending millions of dollars lobbying for relief.</p>
        <p>It is not a grand theme like freedom of speech or censorship that is kicking up all the emotion. The panic involves a rate increase the United States Postal Service has proposed to take effect next year, that would raise the cost of mailing subscription copies of magazines by 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Estimating that the rate increase will cost their industry $300 million in the next two years, magazine publishers are going -- well -- postal.</p>
        <p>''This could be potentially devastating for many magazines,'' said Nina B. Link, the president of the Magazine Publishers of America.</p>
        <p>The Magazine Publishers of America plan to spend $10 million this year lobbying Congress on the issue, while companies like Time Warner, the parent company of Time Inc., have put their own lobbyists to work on the case as well.</p>
        <p>The Magazine Publishers, a trade group to which more than 1,020 of the largest consumer magazines belong, has placed ads in trade journals stating that the proposed increase is twice the average increase the Postal Service usually proposes, is three times the rate of inflation and is double what the Postal Service actually needs to cover the projected costs of processing magazines.</p>
        <p>But economists for the Postal Service say that while the service is willing to negotiate the proposed increase, it is not only necessary -- it is mandated by federal law. The Postal Reform Act of 1970 mandates that every class of mail must cover its own mailing costs.</p>
        <p>This latest rate-increase proposal comes at a tense time for the industry: newsstand sales are sinking, subscriptions are down for many consumer magazines, and several smaller but high-profile magazines have closed this year.</p>
        <p>And some publishers still remember the last time such a large postal increase went into effect for the magazine industry -- in the early 1970's, when the added financial burden contributed to the demise of even some venerable publications like the old weekly Life.</p>
        <p>''Small magazines are the ones that will be most devastated because they have smaller margins,'' Ms. Link said. ''This will hurt them the most. And it will be hard for other magazines with larger circulations that don't have much wiggle room.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Link has spent a substantial part of the last five months on Capitol Hill, pleading with members of the House and the Senate to encourage the Postal Service to turn back the rate hike. She has encouraged both Democrats and Republicans to unite in asking William J. Henderson, the Postmaster General, to reconsider the increase.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Link has been joined by some of the most powerful figures in magazine publishing: Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst Magazines; Christopher M. Little, the  president of the Meredith Publishing Group, and Daniel B. Brewster, the former chief executive of American Express Publishing who is now the chief executive of Gruner + Jahr magazines. She has hit Capitol Hill with as many as 10 magazine publishers in tow.</p>
        <p>''We have been trying to educate anyone and everyone as to why this is so unfair and unjust and unreasonable,'' Ms. Link said.</p>
        <p>The proposed rate increase applies to consumer magazines that are mailed under the bulk classification of ''periodicals.'' Rate increases for other categories, such as first-class mail, are in the single digits. Greg Frey, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said that the last increase -- only 4.6 percent -- was proposed two years ago and went into effect in January 1999. Ms. Link said because that increase was so much smaller, the decision met less criticism from the magazine industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Little of Meredith said that every Meredith title would be affected by the proposed rate increase, the news of which he described as ''a bombshell.''</p>
        <p>''Every copy of Better Homes &amp; Gardens will be affected,'' he said, referring to a Meredith title. ''And at Hearst every copy of Good Housekeeping will be affected, and at Conde Nast, every copy of Vogue.''</p>
        <p>The proposed rate increase has also made strange bedfellows; two of the most concerned crusaders against the increase are The National Geographic Society and Playboy magazine. Both magazines depend on subscriptions for much of their circulation.</p>
        <p>Of The Geographic's 8.5 million circulation, 8.2 million copies are sent by subscription. Playboy's subscribers number 2.6 million out of a total circulation of 3.1 million.</p>
        <p>Robert Sims, senior vice president for magazine publishing at the National Geographic Society, said that it costs the society 24 cents to send a subscription issue out: the proposed increase could raise that to about 27.6 cents an issue. Do the math: at 3.6 extra cents an issue each month for 8.2 million issues, that is an increase of $295,200 a month in expenses for the society.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't sound like much at first,'' he said. ''But when you when you add up the costs of print, editorial, and other distribution costs, well, pretty soon you don't have any money left.'' He described the rate increase as ''potentially devastating for us.''</p>
        <p>Gail Day, a senior vice president at Playboy Enterprises and the publisher of Playboy, said, ''If this goes through, we will have to look to other lines of our business to fund that.''</p>
        <p>Ashley Lyons, an economist and the manager of pricing for the Postal Service, acknowledged that the proposed increase was a substantial one.</p>
        <p>''What we are saying is that the costs of handling magazines will go up by roughly 12.8 percent over the next three years,'' he said, adding that the Postal Service was actively investigating ways to reduce the increase. The Postmaster General testified before the House's Postal Appropriations Subcommittee that he would take steps to achieve $150 million in savings that would apply to magazine handling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frey of the Postal Service said that the service was not singling out any industry and was making every effort to include cost-cutting measures proposed by the publishers.</p>
        <p>''The various classes of mail must support themselves and we cannot cross-subsidize,'' he said. ''And that is mandated by law. For them to feel singled out or to imply that there is a conspiracy against some of our best customers is ridiculous.'' Mr. Frey said that additional increases in postage would be likely this year because of the recent spike in gas prices.</p>
        <p>But even the Postal Service's avowal to try to curb the increase does not placate publishers like Mr. Little, who criticized the Postal Service as poorly managed. He said the Postmaster General had disregarded the Magazine Publishers of America's recommendations over the last two years to keep the increase in the single digits.</p>
        <p>''When we first heard of this 15 percent hike, we came in and said, 'Now wait a minute,' '' Mr. Little said. '' 'We have been working with you for two years and we have been promised that the rate increase would not be anything in the double digits, and then you present us with a 15 percent rate increase.' That to us is just unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>If the magazine industry and the Postal Service cannot reconcile their differences, the magazine industry may be left with little recourse. Ms. Link said that publishers had begun to explore other options, such as shipping magazines via non-government means like United Parcel Service, DHL and Federal Express.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sims of The National Geographic said that the National Geographic Society had broached the idea of negotiating a contract rate with the Postal Service, such as the Society does with foreign postal services like England's Royal Mail. But he said the United States Postal Service will not negotiate individual corporate contracts.</p>
        <p>On June 12, Representative Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Maryland, introduced a bill in Congress that would reduce the rate increase. Congress and the Senate have until November to approve the new rate.</p>
        <p>''Did you ever think you'd hear so much passion about postage rates?'' Ms. Link asked. ''It's ridiculous. I dream about it at night.''</p>
