        <p>Editorial hails Gov George Ryan for instigating new national debate on capital punishment by declaring moratorium on death penalty in face of statistical evidence that innocent people stand real chance of being executed in Illinois; says he has made it politically acceptable for conservative Republicans and Democrats alike to rethink death penalty</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Gov. George Ryan says he never expected the national attention he has received for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. Mr. Ryan found himself in the media spotlight recently  as a counterexample to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was presiding over his 135th execution in five years. Mr. Ryan is by no one's description a maverick. A pharmacist by training, he has spent nearly 30 years in state politics, first as a member of the Illinois Legislature, then as the Republican leader and speaker of the House, then for two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms as secretary of state, until he won election as governor in 1998.</p>
        <p>Yet he has single-handedly instigated a new national debate on capital punishment by acting on conscience when faced with statistical evidence that innocent people stand a very real chance of being executed in Illinois. Since 1977, 13 inmates on death row in that state have been exonerated compared with 12 executed. A series in The Chicago Tribune found that of 260 capital cases that had been appealed, fully half have been reversed for a new trial or sentencing hearing. In more than 30 cases, the lawyers representing death row inmates were disbarred or suspended. New research nationwide has found that nearly 70 percent of capital cases that were fully reviewed were found to have reversible error.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Ryan says he never expected the national attention he has received for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois. Mr. Ryan found himself in the media spotlight recently  as a counterexample to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who was presiding over his 135th execution in five years. Mr. Ryan is by no one's description a maverick. A pharmacist by training, he has spent nearly 30 years in state politics, first as a member of the Illinois Legislature, then as the Republican leader and speaker of the House, then for two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms as secretary of state, until he won election as governor in 1998.</p>
        <p>Yet he has single-handedly instigated a new national debate on capital punishment by acting on conscience when faced with statistical evidence that innocent people stand a very real chance of being executed in Illinois. Since 1977, 13 inmates on death row in that state have been exonerated compared with 12 executed. A series in The Chicago Tribune found that of 260 capital cases that had been appealed, fully half have been reversed for a new trial or sentencing hearing. In more than 30 cases, the lawyers representing death row inmates were disbarred or suspended. New research nationwide has found that nearly 70 percent of capital cases that were fully reviewed were found to have reversible error.</p>
        <p>By being the first governor to impose a moratorium on executions, Mr. Ryan has made it politically acceptable for conservative Republicans and Democrats alike to rethink capital punishment and how it is carried out. Many politicians have avoided the issue for fear of being called soft on crime.  The situation in Illinois has caused even some prominent conservatives like the evangelist Pat Robertson to question the fairness of this system.  Governor Ryan himself has long been a death penalty supporter. But given the record of mistakes, he says, ''we have no choice but to try to fix'' the system. He has appointed a commission to examine the administration of the death penalty and to make recommendations for change. He has set no deadline for the commission's work and recently said that the moratorium will stand indefinitely unless the commission can give him a ''100 percent guarantee'' that the system can be made fair and just.</p>
        <p>That high standard calls into question the record of other death penalty states. For death penalty supporters like Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Ryan's cautious approach is a rebuke to their own blindness to the system's mistakes. He has instructed the nation on the only morally coherent position for supporters of capital punishment to take, and that is that no execution can go forward when there is abundant evidence that innocent people have been put on death row.</p>
        <p>This page opposes the death penalty on a variety of humanitarian, egalitarian, constitutional and moral principles. But even those who do not share those principles ought to concede, as Governor Ryan has, that it is legally indefensible to execute a single innocent person. That means, by our lights, that capital punishment can never be acceptable as standard national practice for a practical, legal reason as well as for the reasons of principle listed above. For as Governor Ryan has pointed out, our national experience has shown that no system of investigations and trials can be so perfect, so free of human error or flawed evidence or mistaken identity as to guarantee that innocent people will not be executed.</p>
