        <p>Planes gliding over beaches on Saturday on Long Island and the Jersey Shore as well as in Los Angeles, Chicago and Hilton Head, S.C., will carry banners reading, '' 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.' Read it Now!''</p>
        <p>At least 9,000 Federal Express trucks will be deployed around the nation on that morning by the Internet retail giant Amazon.com to help deliver 250,000 presold copies of the fantasy novel.</p>
        <p>A giant screen in Times Square will herald the birth of the fourth book in the hugely successful Harry Potter series about an orphaned boy with wizard powers.</p>
        <p>And the staff at the Blue Marble bookshop in Fort Thomas, Ky., will dress up like wizards and witches and begin doling out cinnamon oatmeal from a black cauldron at 6 a.m. to waiting families. Compared with hundreds of other bookstores around the nation, that's late. By all accounts there will be tens of thousands of sleepless children and parents -- perhaps many more -- showing up in  bookstores late Friday night.</p>
        <p>At 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, when the novel by the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, officially goes on sale, small independent bookshops and selected stores in chains like Borders are opening their doors to Harry Potter theme parties with magic shows, costume parties featuring characters from the book, stuffed and even live owls, who are messengers in the novels, and at the Tattered Cover bookstore in Denver, a brew of ginger ale and apple juice on dry ice to imitate Harry's favorite butter beer.</p>
        <p>''People are frenzied out there about this book,'' said Richard Klein, owner with his brother, Bob, of the Book Revue in Huntington, N.Y., one of the biggest independent bookstores in the region. This Long Island shop already has an unusually high number of copies of the book reserved -- 500 -- and the staff will unpack hundreds of others just after midnight during a children's party at the store. ''I have never seen anything like this,'' Richard Klein said.</p>
        <p>Nor has anyone else in the publishing business.</p>
        <p>Since the first ''Harry Potter'' was published by Scholastic in the United States in 1998, the series by Ms. Rowling has sold nearly 21 million copies, including the paperback of the first novel, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.'' The other novels are ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.'' The newest ''Harry Potter,'' a 752-page book, will be published simultaneously in the United States and Britain with a record first printing of 3.8 million copies in America. The books have been translated into 35 languages.</p>
        <p>''The anticipation is beyond anything we imagined,'' said Michael Jacobs, a senior vice president at Scholastic and the executive in charge of marketing. ''The book has crossed over and is now being read by adults now as well as children. The anticipation has allowed us to have the biggest first printing in the history of trade publishing.''</p>
        <p>The anticipation has also led to even more bruised relations between bookstores and their main competitor, Internet retailers like Amazon.com, which was allowed to essentially break the embargo and open book crates on Friday to ship them by Federal Express.</p>
        <p>More important, beyond the promotion and hoopla generated by Scholastic, the book and its accompanying huge audio sale by Random House's Listening Library has led,  say various booksellers, to a remarkable resurgence of interest in books among children in elementary and middle schools who have ignored reading in favor of the Internet, video games and watching television.</p>
        <p>What is fueling the instant success of the new book is a shrewd campaign by Scholastic -- and, for that matter, Ms. Rowling, who is involved in the marketing -- to keep everything about it secret including the plot and the title. It was only after the title was printed in the British press that Scholastic acknowledged it. In keeping the book embargoed and under military-style secrecy, Scholastic drew even more attention to it.</p>
        <p>''Each book has just ratcheted up the anticipation for the next one,'' said Mr. Jacobs of Scholastic. ''We wanted very much to have a specific on-sale date. We felt we could build anticipation to a certain frenzy. As soon as kids finished book three, they were waiting for the next one.''</p>
        <p>And they have. At the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington, Susan Dexter, who works in the children's department, said many parents had told her that they were showing up with their children at midnight on Friday to buy the book. ''The more I hear, the more I know there's going to be a crowd,'' said Ms. Dexter, who recalled the visit of Ms. Rowling for a book-signing in the late afternoon last fall.</p>
        <p>''People started lining up early in the morning,'' she said. ''It was like a Rolling Stones concert.''</p>
        <p>Why the Harry Potter books have stirred the imagination of so many young readers is not entirely clear. Ms. Rowling, who wrote the first book while on welfare and living with her infant daughter in an unheated apartment in Edinburgh, has told her delighted publishers that she plans a total of seven Harry Potter books, each one dealing with a hero who grows steadily into young manhood. The ideas for the books, she said, came on a London-bound train ride from Manchester in 1990.</p>
        <p>The fantasies tell the story of an orphan, Harry Potter, who lives with his dull and cruel Muggle (nonmagical) relatives. The boy has a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead, a result of the attack on his parents by the evil Lord who killed them when he was an infant. Soon the boy is informed that he is a wizard, and is whisked off to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, facing adventures with his friends as they learn magic. The simple-sounding plot is dense with enough perilous adventure to stir an anti-Potter reaction among some school districts, parents and evangelical ministers who are troubled by the dark tone of the Potter books, the details about witchcraft and Harry's near collisions with death.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the first three Potter books -- and most likely, the fourth -- seem to have tapped into the fears and imaginations of millions of children and their parents. At one point the three hardcovers and a paperback version of the first book held the top spots simultaneously on The New York Times best-seller lists, which resulted, in part, in the newspaper's decision to create a separate category for best-selling children's books, to start July 23.</p>
        <p>''The book has struck a chord not only because they're wonderful stories, but because Harry Potter is an unlikely hero: he's a little bit different from everybody else and kids identify with that,'' said Tina Moore, owner of the Blue Marble Bookstore in Fort Thomas, Ky., who said she expected to serve oatmeal and doughnuts to as many as 80  children and their parents early Saturday and hoped to sell as many as 200 copies of the new book on the weekend.</p>
        <p>''The kids who love Harry are  often not the stars, not the best athletes,'' Ms. Moore said. ''They feel they can identify with Harry because he's a normal boy with a special gift -- he's a wizard.''</p>
        <p>Richard Robinson, chairman of Scholastic, said that the book is, in some ways, in the same vein as a classic like ''Alice in Wonderland.''</p>
        <p>''It's a classic tale of good and evil,'' Mr. Robinson said. ''It's about children battling for themselves and for good in a world of good and evil. It's the classic story of a young person thrust into a world of danger.''</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Rowling's life and career, the success of the book has an aura of Cinderella about it. Ms. Rowling sent her first book unsolicited to a London agent, Christopher Little, who sold it to Bloomsbury in 1996 after other publishers rejected it. Scholastic  bought the book in 1997 for $105,000, after Arthur A. Levine, vice president at Scholastic, read it on a plane from the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy.</p>
        <p>At the same time a British film producer, David Heyman, who has an arrangement with Warner Brothers, acquired the rights to the book. Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of worldwide production at Warner Brothers, said that two associates, Lionel Wigram and Polly Cohen,  strongly urged him to read the book.  ''It was incredibly visual,'' he said. ''Once I read it, I was stunned.''</p>
        <p>The first book was bought for about $500,000, and Warner Brothers has the rights to the other Harry Potter books. The film, directed by Chris Columbus (''Home Alone'') is  to start production in the fall with a mostly British cast that may include Maggie Smith, Tim Roth and Robbie Coltrane. Warner Brothers is seeking to turn this into a Hollywood franchise that could generate as much as $1 billion in merchandising and licensing revenue, equaling and perhaps surpassing the studio's Batman franchise.</p>
        <p>Not only does Ms. Rowling have a financial share of the merchandising and licensing revenues, but she has  also taken a role in virtually all the major decisions connected to the movie and its spinoffs.</p>
        <p>At the moment, though, Ms. Rowling -- and her publishers -- are focusing on her new book.</p>
        <p>What has left booksellers annoyed is that the tight security enforced by a strict release date -- they had to sign affidavits from Scholastic ensuring that the novel would not be sold before July 8 -- seems to have been relaxed under the publisher's arrangement with Amazon.com. That deal allowed Amazon to ship out books overnight on July 7 by Federal Express.</p>
        <p>''I got a little nervous about what would happen if we didn't sign,'' said Barbara Theroux, owner of Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont. ''And now you have Amazon opening the books the day before. I'm glad some people are taking Scholastic to task about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs of Scholastic acknowledged that some bookstore owners were upset. ''We've gotten flak,'' he said. ''We want the playing field to be completely level for all our retailers to make the book available on July 8.'' He said Amazon had given Scholastic assurances that the contents of the book would not be leaked out.</p>
        <p>Aside from all this, booksellers and the publisher said the impact of ''Harry Potter'' on children's reading habits has been gratifying.</p>
        <p>''The most phenomenal thing is that boys who didn't read are devouring this book,'' said Margot Sage-EL, owner of Watchung Booksellers in Montclair, N.J. ''And the book seems to have awakened in children a realization that reading is entertainment.''</p>
