        <p>Looking relaxed and sounding unruffled, saying that his form is good but needs some improvement, Lance Armstrong predicted a tough Tour de France. ''It'll be a good fight,'' he said solemnly, then broke into a smile, as if he knew a secret.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he does. Perhaps, though, it's not really a secret. ''I like my own chances,'' he finally said. He squared his jaw and waited for a contradiction -- a dare that was hard to accept.</p>

        <p>Looking relaxed and sounding unruffled, saying that his form is good but needs some improvement, Lance Armstrong predicted a tough Tour de France. ''It'll be a good fight,'' he said solemnly, then broke into a smile, as if he knew a secret.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he does. Perhaps, though, it's not really a secret. ''I like my own chances,'' he finally said. He squared his jaw and waited for a contradiction -- a dare that was hard to accept.</p>
        <p>Armstrong is no longer in the overall leader's yellow jersey that he wore for two weeks last summer. He finished second to David Millar of Cofidis as the 87th Tour began Saturday, and Millar retained the yellow jersey today after finishing 17th in the 120.5-mile race from Futuroscope to Loudun. Tom Steels of Mapei won the opening stage in 4 hours 46 minutes 8 seconds. Armstrong was 37th, in the same time as Steels, and  is second over all, trailing Millar by  four seconds.</p>
        <p>Millar is, as Armstrong described him, ''a good guy and a good friend,'' but Armstrong has a long memory. When the new leader of the Tour came up to him at the starting line in Futuroscope this morning and proudly showed him his yellow jersey, yellow helmet and yellow shorts, Armstrong said, ''One thing wrong.''</p>
        <p>''What's that?'' Millar asked. Armstrong pointed to the Cofidis team name on Millar's shorts. Armstrong feels that Cofidis betrayed him by trying to reduce his salary and then terminate his contract when he was stricken with testicular cancer four years ago.</p>
        <p>Yellow jersey or not, Armstrong, the leader of the United States Postal Service team, is wearing No. 1 on his back because of his victory in the Tour last year and he is, as L'Equipe, the French newspaper, called him Saturday, Le Boss.</p>
        <p>His strength has been evident in races this spring and his motivation is, as always, sky high. He is riding, he says, not only ''to prove that a cancer survivor can win this bike race, the hardest sporting event in the world,'' but also to gain the respect of some riders.</p>
        <p>Why, he was asked today, after his clear-cut triumph last year, do so many people say this is an open race and then list seven, eight and nine candidates for victory?</p>
        <p>''I think that started with those guys who weren't here last year,'' Armstrong replied, naming Marco Pantani, the Italian who won the Tour in 1998, and Jan Ullrich, the German who won in 1997. ''Pantani and Ullrich perhaps didn't respect the race last year.''</p>
        <p>Pantani missed last year's race after failing a drug test; Ullrich was injured.</p>
        <p>''But that's all history,'' the 28-year-old Armstrong said. ''It doesn't matter. We're all here now, everybody's here, and I think everybody will have the ambition to go to the finish. That's the way I prefer it.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong poured a glass of water and went on: ''It's hard this year. It's a totally different race from last year, not that it wasn't hard then. But being the defending champion, being that the course is a lot harder this year, being that all the others are back, there are totally different dynamics.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the psychological factor, he was talking tactics. ''You can't have a cushion this year and let guys get away -- no, you can't do that,'' he said. ''Everybody can be a threat unless they have a poor team trial,'' which will be held Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''As the defending champion, I know I'm a marked man,'' he said, ''but this Tour should be a little easier than last year's because I'm one more year away from cancer.</p>
        <p>''To sum it up, I'm a little less nervous than I was last year. I'm confident about my team and comfortable about my condition. Plus I have the experience of winning the Tour.''</p>
        <p>Is he stronger than last year? After a long pause, Armstrong answered: ''Probably yes. That's normal with age and the further away I get from my illness. It's normal that my body is still recovering from that period, but at the same time I am getting older and more experienced. I should be stronger.</p>
        <p>''I still have to work hard. I don't like to train. I'm lazy.'' He allowed himself a mischievous grin. ''No, actually I thrive on training, it's fun to me. I prefer it to racing.''</p>
        <p>Training pays a lot less than racing, he was told.</p>
        <p>''Not if you win the one race a year,'' he replied. ''It's too bad, but that's the way it is. The Tour is so big.''</p>
