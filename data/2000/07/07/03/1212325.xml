        <p>It was a fine, sunny Sunday today, and thousands of people flocked to Lebanon's newest tourist attraction -- the barbed-wire fence at the new official border with Israel -- for a stroll with the kids, a chance to pose for pictures and videos, or even to throw a stone or two in the general direction of the Israelis.</p>
        <p>By late morning, festive, flag-bedecked cars and buses jammed the narrow roads, pockmarked by artillery, that wind through the steep, stony hills of the strip of southern Lebanon that Israel and its proxy militia had occupied for more than two decades.

        <p>It was a fine, sunny Sunday today, and thousands of people flocked to Lebanon's newest tourist attraction -- the barbed-wire fence at the new official border with Israel -- for a stroll with the kids, a chance to pose for pictures and videos, or even to throw a stone or two in the general direction of the Israelis.</p>
        <p>By late morning, festive, flag-bedecked cars and buses jammed the narrow roads, pockmarked by artillery, that wind through the steep, stony hills of the strip of southern Lebanon that Israel and its proxy militia had occupied for more than two decades. Lebanon, alone in the Arab world, has Sunday as its day of rest, a tradition of its Christian-led government.</p>
        <p>Along the way from Beirut, many of the village squares were decorated with broken-down armored cars or old artillery pieces, now plastered with Hezbollah posters, that were left behind when the South Lebanon Army, the Israeli-sponsored militia, fled after Israel's abrupt pullout in May.</p>
        <p>Bright yellow Hezbollah flags flew over all the old South Lebanon Army and Israeli strongholds and gun positions, but there was no sign in the streets of armed militiamen or the once-common checkpoints. In the last few days, new yellow roadside signs have sprouted, marking places where Israeli patrols were ambushed by Hezbollah, or where the Islamic militia lost some of the 1,200 resistance ''martyrs,'' as it calls the fighters killed doing battle here.</p>
        <p>A mock-up of a Katyusha multiple rocket launcher, made of plastic piping with Sohat mineral water bottles painted red posing as missile tips, has been set up by the entrance to the walk along the border. The model was the subject of urgent phone calls between military officials on both sides of the border and United Nations peacekeepers before assurances were given that it was a fake.</p>
        <p>In true Lebanese fashion, merchants have sprung up around it: an ice cream truck, a couple of makeshift restaurants, stands selling clothing, watches and tapes of resistance songs.</p>
        <p>''Thank God, business is good,'' said Mahmoud, a hefty, bearded fighter-turned-merchant at what appeared to be the authorized Hezbollah souvenir stand, directly across from the fortified Israeli position at the Fatima Gate, where Israel used to let its South Lebanon Army allies enter the country. ''Especially on Sunday. All the day is like this, crowded.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah baseball caps in yellow, red or blue were selling for two American dollars, the preferred currency. There were small yellow Hezbollah flags for $2, bigger ones for $3, along with T-shirts, key chains, recordings and other knickknacks. But even this shop had no monopoly on framed pictures of the Hezbollah leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah; they were everywhere, showing the sheik looking thoughtful, waving a rifle or talking on a cell phone.</p>
        <p>Near the gate, Jalal Hammoud -- who had grown up here, been jailed and expelled by the South Lebanon Army, and returned last month -- happily tended the gas-fired oven in a cargo container marked ''Bakery of Liberation,'' which he had moved down from Beirut.</p>
        <p>''It is my village; I was born and lived here,'' he said, making manoushee, a traditional thin, flat bread, topped with thyme, cheese or meat. ''Now we are happy. And business is good, especially Sunday because thousands of people come from Beirut.''</p>
        <p>Stretched near the entrance was a banner reading, ''Thanks to Hezbollah,'' and the Shiite Muslims here, the constituency of the Party of God, took particular pride in what the sheik and his men have trumpeted as the sole Arab victory over the Israelis.</p>
        <p>For the most part, it is a kind of a promenade, a walk along the barbed-wire-lined fence looking into the Israeli positions. There were troops of Shiite Muslim boy and girl scouts, the girls with light blue smocks and darker head coverings. For women, the styles ranged from full black Iranian-style chadors to open-toed spike heels. People took pictures along the fence, videotaped everything in sight and climbed on buildings for a better view.</p>
        <p>But someone -- apparently, members of Hezbollah -- had also thoughtfully dumped piles of rocks at convenient intervals along the walkway, and many people, particularly young men, hurled them over the fence. Except for a rare Humvee on a quick patrol of the dirt road next to the fence, there were no Israelis in sight. Still, the stone-throwers seemed to find it a satisfying exercise. One 7-year-old girl, Tamara Hajji, came from near Zahle with a slingshot in her back pocket, and her parents clustered around encouragingly as she took aim.</p>
        <p>Among the crowd, there were also many Palestinians living in Lebanon, including one group of 234 from the Bekaa region. Beneath their stone-throwing bravado was a fear that they are being left out of the maneuvering toward some sort of Middle East peace, as well as a bitterness at the way they are treated here.</p>
        <p>''Get out, get out,'' screamed an elderly Palestinian woman, awkwardly heaving a rock at the fence.</p>
        <p>Fresh from Dearborn, Mich., Abed Hussein, a Ford Motor worker, took in the scene with his daughters, Nancy, 19, who wore a white head scarf with her red Tommy Hilfiger jersey, and Zinab, 17. The whole scene, Zinab said, made her feel proud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hussein had come with the girls to visit his 82-year-old father, Abed Hussein, who had fled his home in Israel in 1949. The elder Mr. Hussein still lives near Sidon, where he raised the next generation of his Palestinian family.</p>
        <p>About a dozen members of the extended family piled into a green van, the girls trailing Hezbollah flags out the windows, and drove through back roads until they found an old border post left over from the days of the British and French Mandates, videotaping all the while. By the old wrecked gate was a Hezbollah outpost, manned by a couple of riflemen. Up the hill stood an Israeli watchtower. Here, the old man could point to the village where he grew up, Malkiya.</p>
        <p>One man dug up some of the soil and put it in a plastic bag to take home. Another car pulled up to the lonely spot with another Palestinian family from Dearborn. Someone put one of the resistance cassettes they had just bought in the car's player, and soon they were all holding hands, dancing in a circle to the strong beat.</p>
        <p>''That was my father's father's father's land,'' the old man said, pointing past the barbed wire. ''The fig and olive trees are all the same. When I see it, it is like a knife cutting my stomach.''</p>
