        <p>Trippi, the horse named for a onetime football star who could run with breakaway speed, showed once more that he could run with breakaway speed, too, when he rocketed past older sprinters yesterday and swept the Tom Fool Handicap at Belmont Park by 4 1/2 lengths.</p>

        <p>Trippi, the horse named for a onetime football star who could run with breakaway speed, showed once more that he could run with breakaway speed, too, when he rocketed past older sprinters yesterday and swept the Tom Fool Handicap at Belmont Park by 4 1/2 lengths.</p>
        <p>It was the sixth victory in seven starts this year for the 3-year-old son of End Sweep, his only loss coming when he finished 11th in the Kentucky Derby. After that, he came back to win the Riva Ridge by 9 lengths, and in the Tom Fool he dominated five older horses with widening speed all the way.</p>
        <p>Among the rivals chasing him were two sons of Storm Cat: the long-shot Cornish Snow and, another length back in third, Sailor's Warning. And in fourth place came the second favorite, the 6-year-old Brutally Frank, making his 55th start after finishing first or second in his previous seven races.</p>
        <p>Trippi, named for the Georgia running back Charley Trippi, is owned by Cot Campbell's Dogwood Stable and trained by Todd Pletcher. He also had a hot jockey aboard, Jerry Bailey, who won his fourth race of the day in five starts and padded his lead in the standing to 52 winners in 131 starts.</p>
        <p>The horses set some blazing fractions, too, dashing the first quarter-mile in 22 seconds and the first half in 44 2/5  seconds. And they completed the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5 , making Trippi 4 for 4 at the distance and 5 for 5 with Bailey in the saddle. They were no surprise: Trippi paid $3.90 for a $2 bet to win, and went home with $90,000.</p>
        <p>''He didn't race as a 2-year-old because he had a virus in April and then some shin problems in the fall,'' Pletcher said. ''But he's getting bigger and stronger with each passing month.''</p>
        <p>In the 94th running of the Astoria, a sprint for 2-year-old fillies, most of the sprinting was done by Raging Fever, who poured it on for an 11 1/4-length romp in a field of only four. At the finish, they were spread out from here to there, with Rose Bay second by 3 lengths over Best Mate, who had more than 9 on Zealous Z.</p>
        <p>Mark Hennig, who trains Raging Fever, scratched his other star juvenile filly, With Ability, and kept both undefeated in four starts. ''It's nice to keep With Ability in the barn and be represented like this,'' he said in something of an understatement.</p>
        <p>Raging Fever, a daughter of Storm Cat owned by Edward P. Evans, ran the five and a half furlongs in 1:04 1/5  and paid $2.20 as the favorite.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The extended holiday weekend of stakes racing continues today at Belmont with the Prioress for 3-year-old fillies at six furlongs and the Tremont for 2-year-olds at five and a half furlongs. But the pace picks up tomorrow, when the $500,000 Suburban Handicap will be run at a mile and a quarter. Only six horses were entered yesterday, largely because of the presence of 6-year-old Behrens and 4-year-old Lemon Drop Kid. They split two meetings last year and will probably meet four times this year, peaking in the Breeders' Cup Classic. ''If anything, Lemon Drop Kid is going to have his best shot to beat us in the Suburban,'' said JAMES BOND, the trainer of Behrens. ''He's the young kid on the block, and he's going to try to knock off the old man.''</p>
