        <p>STAR-SPANGLED EDEN  By James C. Simmons  Illustrated. 350 Pages. Carroll &amp; Graf. $26.</p>
        <p>The spitting was murder. Charles Dickens called Washington ''the headquarters of tobacco-tinctured saliva,'' adding, ''I would be content even to live in an atmosphere of spit, if they would but spit clean.'' Oscar Wilde observed that ''America is one long expectoration.'' And Frances Trollope, the famously tart author of ''Domestic Manners of the Americans,'' captured the American ambience all too colorfully by remarking that ''the gentlemen spit, talk of elections and the price of produce, and spit again.'' As for sound effects, Mrs. Trollope otherwise observed that ''when a patriotic fit seized them and 'Yankee Doodle' was called for, every man seemed to think his reputation as a citizen depended on the noise he made.''</p>
        <p>Clearly there was much for James C. Simmons to work with in assembling this panoramic survey of 19th-century America and how it appeared to certain well-known, often jaundiced observers from the British Isles. And while it is not promising to discover that Mr. Simmons is the author of privately commissioned personal, family and corporate histories, he proves well-suited to the omnibus format of ''Star-Spangled Eden.''</p>
        <p>His own writing has a textbook tone, but it glosses over a wide array of 19th-century events and customs, and it is studded with livelier firsthand observations. From the fact that a gentleman could be ostracized in Cincinnati for using the word ''corset'' in mixed company to a brief history of longhorn cattle, his book provides an enjoyably anecdotal backward look. It's a way to learn, for instance, that ticket scalpers of the past were known to smear their clothing with molasses while they lurked near box offices, in order to keep other, cleaner customers away.</p>
        <p>''Star-Spangled Eden'' concentrates on eight British visitors and proceeds chronologically, from the dismay of Mrs. Trollope (Anthony's mother) at being addressed as ''old woman'' in America, which she first visited in 1827, to Oscar Wilde's 1882 comment on Niagara Falls: ''Every American bride is taken there, and the sight of that stupendous waterfall must be one of the earliest, if not the keenest, disappointments in American married life.''</p>
        <p>Through the eyes of these visitors, who have little in common beyond Mr. Simmons's decision to include them, the book glimpses the Civil War, the hardships of slaves on Georgia plantations, the spectacle of Union soldiers streaming into Washington after being routed at the Battle of Bull Run, stagecoach travel, the authentic Wild West and the exotic life of the Mountain Man. Imagine the surprise of George Ruxton's English editor when Ruxton, who had gone native in a big way while writing ''Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains,'' claimed to be ''half froze for buffler meat and mountain doin's'' after he had returned home.</p>
        <p>The most celebrated English visitor included here is of course Dickens, whose 1842 visit prompted the kind of reception now associated with Britney Spears. ''People eat  him here!'' remarked one observer about the fanfare, which had soured and backfired by the time Dickens described his travels in ''American Notes.''</p>
        <p>Angered by the pirating of his work by American publishers, Dickens had already made himself persona non grata before he drew attention to Manhattan's stray farm animal population. ''Here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself,'' he wrote. ''He has only one ear, having parted with the other to vagrant dogs in the course of his city rambles. . . . He is in every respect a republican pig, going wherever he pleases and mingling with the best society, on an equal if not superior footing, for every one makes way when he appears, and the haughtiest give him the wall, if he prefer it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons gives equal time to Fanny Kemble, the popular actress who came to America to perform, fell in love with a Southerner, married him and then found herself to be the mistress of two large Georgia plantations. A committed abolitionist with an innately patronizing manner (''How marvelously unpoetical these people!'' she declared about the general American populace), she traveled south and wound up publishing a forceful denunciation of slavery. And the marriage was brief.</p>
        <p>Also here is Frank Harris, well known for the sexual exploits of ''My Life and Loves'' but here describing being on a work crew building the Brooklyn Bridge. Richard Burton, the seasoned explorer with a taste for exotica, is on the record here for a visit to Salt Lake City, where he observed polygamous family life with great interest. ''A menage a trois, in the Mormon sense of the phrase, is fatal to the development of that tender tie which must be confined to two,'' he wrote. ''In its stead there is household comfort, attention, circumspect friendship and domestic discipline.''</p>
        <p>One of the sharpest-eyed observers here is William Howard Russell, the war correspondent whose Crimean dispatches for The Times of London are thought to have inspired Tennyson's ''Charge of the Light Brigade'' and prompted Florence Nightingale to take up battlefield nursing.  His well-recorded sojourn in Washington at the start of the Civil War included vivid meetings with President and Mrs. Lincoln. ''She is profuse in the introduction of the word 'sir' in every sentence, which is now almost an Americanism confined to certain classes,'' he informed English readers.</p>
        <p>Bull Run Russell, who earned that nickname for stirring reporting about newly embattled America, also memorably describes becoming ill and being told by an American doctor to drink a mint julep every two hours. But on the whole, as one Confederate soldier's wife wrote of Russell: ''I find his criticism mild. I expected so much worse. Those Englishmen come, somebody says, with their three P's -- Pen, Paper and Prejudices.'' And she concluded, ''He let us off easily.''</p>
