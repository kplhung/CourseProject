        <p>More than a year and a half ago, President Clinton signed a law pledging money and military equipment to opponents of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Last week, a group of them came to Washington, still waiting for signs that support is coming.</p>
        <p>Even though the law gives Mr. Clinton the authority to spend as much as $97 million to help speed the overthrow of Mr. Hussein, the administration has so far spent only $20,000 of it, the cost of sending three Iraqi exiles to a training course in civilian-military relations at an Air Force base in Florida.</p>
        <p>The administration's failure to act on its pledge to support Mr. Hussein's fractious, far-flung opponents has prompted growing criticism from Republicans in Congress, who used last week's visit by opposition leaders to intensify attacks on the administration's policy toward Iraq.</p>
        <p>''It is hard for me to figure out why administration officials, from President Clinton and Vice President Gore on down, keep insisting that they are interested in ousting Saddam and yet not one official of this administration has been willing to take even the most minimal steps towards that end,'' Senator Sam Brownback, a Republican from Kansas, said at a Senate subcommittee hearing on Wednesday that was attended by several opposition leaders.</p>
        <p>The Iraqi opponents of Mr. Hussein, including exiles and dissidents from inside Iraq, spent the week meeting with senior administration officials at the State Department and the Pentagon to press them for more assistance, including military training for 140 Iraqis and military equipment like communications gear that, they argued, could be used to foment opposition to Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>After meeting with the opponents on Monday, Vice President Al Gore voiced strong support for their goal. And late last week, officials said they were trying to schedule military training courses for as many of the 140 as possible, starting in the fall.</p>
        <p>But administration and defense officials balked at some of the opponents' other requests. Those included a request to expand the ''no flight'' zones in southern and northern Iraq, to expand the mission of American jets to include attacking Iraq's ground forces fighting rebels in the south and to set up humanitarian relief centers inside Iraq that would be operated by opposition groups  based in neighboring countries, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The American officials emphasized that the military training would only involve courses in leadership, international law, medicine, civil engineering and public affairs, and not combat.</p>
        <p>Ahmad Chalabi, a leader of the Iraqi National Congress who is based in London, welcomed the additional training but complained that the administration refused to provide weapons and other military equipment to confront Mr. Hussein's forces on the battlefield.</p>
        <p>''You cannot liberate Iraq by treating wounded people,'' Dr. Chalabi said in the Senate hearing on Wednesday. ''We need to liberate Iraq by fighting Saddam.''</p>
        <p>At the same hearing, a leader of the Shiite rebels fighting in southern Iraq, Seyid Kadhim al-Batatt, complained that American aircraft patrolling the ''no flight'' zones over the region did little to help their cause.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, American aircraft fly over us as we are being continuously bombarded by Saddam's forces,'' he said, citing a clash with Iraq forces in the swamps near Basra on May 15.</p>
        <p>The opponents' demands are being echoed by Republicans here and are turning Iraq into an issue in the presidential campaign between Mr. Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Bush has vowed to take a tough stand against Mr. Hussein, and some of his advisers have called for actively supporting the seizure of Iraqi territory.</p>
        <p>But administration officials and, especially, military commanders remain deeply skeptical. They say the opposition leaders remain divided by lingering hostilities and lack popular support inside Iraq or in the Arab world.</p>
        <p>Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, commander of all American forces in the Persian Gulf, said Mr. Hussein's forces would easily crush an armed insurgency like the one the opponents have proposed. The opponents, he said, needed to spend more time in the region turning themselves into a credible alternative to Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the military adventures that they're seeking for us to fund are reasonable,'' General Zinni said in an interview last Monday. ''They are pie in the sky. They're going to lead us to a Bay of Goats, or something like that.''</p>
