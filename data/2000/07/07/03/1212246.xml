        <p>Do not look for Pro, a new magazine, in local stores. The publication will be sent only to the homes of its target market: professional athletes.</p>
        <p>The glossy publication, which features helpful articles on everything from investment planning (three athletes ''show their monetary moves'') to buying a luxury watch (''it's all in the wrist''), is shooting for a tiny target audience of 25,000.</p>
        <p>The quarterly magazine, introduced in May, is circulated only to  current and recently retired American professional athletes, who receive it free.</p>
        <p>While many magazines depend on revenues from advertising for a significant portion of their budgets, Pro's publisher, Street &amp; Smith's, plans to rely solely on ad sales --  confident that advertisers will jump at the opportunity for access to one of the nation's most affluent demographic groups.</p>
        <p>The typical professional athlete makes far more than do doctors or even the chief executives of major corporations. And since the athletes that receive Pro are also usually younger than other affluent professionals, they are less likely to be loyal to certain brands.</p>
        <p>John Capouya, Pro's editor in chief and a former editor at The New York Times, said part of what makes the gamble surrounding his new magazine interesting is its reliance on advertising alone.</p>
        <p>''We guarantee advertisers exclusive access to these people at home,'' he said. ''That's what we think is our unique advantage.''</p>
        <p>The first issue features advertisements for a luxury yachting company, a home security company run by former Navy Seals and an asset management group.</p>
        <p>Each issue will have sections on topics like shopping, exotic travel, sports psychology and health. Many of the short articles are collaborations between writers and athletes, Mr. Capouya said.</p>
        <p>The magazine, as Mr. Capouya states in his first letter from the editor, will not feature any negative stories about athletes. Instead, it will try to help athletes by providing advice, mentoring and support, he said.</p>
        <p>Brad Hopkins, a Tennessee Titans lineman who encouraged athletes to hold open doors and sign autographs in the article he wrote for the first issue, said: ''I don't know if helpful is the word. Let's just say entertaining.''</p>
