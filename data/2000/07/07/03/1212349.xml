        <p>Deep in the trenches of today's historic elections, Gerardo Mellado served his party as a sort of 911 operator, manning a two-way radio that crackled with calls for help from the rural communities in the mountains that surround this city of 120,000 people.</p>
        <p>The elections were expected to be the most free and transparent political contests in Mexican history. And Mr. Mellado, of the opposition National Action Party, known as PAN, aimed to protect each ballot cast for his side from the kind of chicanery that many say has helped to keep the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in power since 1929.</p>
        <p>''I copy, I copy,'' Mr. Mellado told a caller from a farming village called Mariano Escobedo. ''They are letting people vote without the proper credentials? I am sending a lawyer with a video camera right away. Do you copy?''</p>
        <p>In the contest between the PAN candidate for president, Vicente Fox Quesada, and the candidate for the PRI, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, some of the most ferocious conflicts have arisen in places like this, located at the western edge of the state of Veracruz. Most cities in this state, including Orizaba, have PAN mayors. But due to support for the PRI in the rural communities, the governor of Veracruz, Miguel Aleman, is a member of the PRI, as are most members of the state's congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>But according to early returns across Veracruz -- the state with the third-highest number of eligible voters in Mexico -- the PRI's support among peasants had begun to erode. The PRI's power among peasants -- who live mostly on their crops and government assistance -- could not quash a palpable desire for change.</p>
        <p>''We had been feeding the PRI for a long time with our votes and they left us with nothing,'' said Celia Gonzalez Hernandez, a mother of three in Mariano Escobedo. ''Now there will be more power for poor people.''</p>
        <p>The PAN's strong showing in the villages represented a significant triumph for Mr. Fox's party, whose workers watched carefully all day over their newest, and most vulnerable, supporters.</p>
        <p>''The votes out there will mean the difference between winning and losing for us,'' said Francisco Briseno Cortes, who is president of the PAN in Orizaba. ''The PRI still has a lot of ways to try to manipulate the people out there, because they are isolated and afraid. So we have to make sure we watch over the brave minority who support us.''</p>
        <p>Although many polls opened at least half an hour later than scheduled, voting around Orizaba proceeded without any significant disturbances reported.</p>
        <p>In the weeks prior to the election, however, the campaigns had been explosive. Just over a week ago, the mayor of Orizaba, a surgeon and PAN member named Angel Escudero seized a truckload of 4,500 sheets of metal sent to the city by the PRI governor, Mr. Aleman. The metal, marked for the attention of the ruling party's candidate for Congress, was to be distributed to poor farmers for mending their ramshackle homes.</p>
        <p>PRI officials called the delivery ''a coincidence.'' Dr. Escudero, 65, said: ''It was a crime. We had always known the PRI used government supplies to try to buy votes, but now we had proof.''</p>
        <p>After Dr. Escudero intercepted the metal, local PRI leaders led protests that shut down the city hall for two days. Demonstrators threw eggs at the windows of Dr. Escudero's small hospital and another angry mob tried to enter his home.</p>
        <p>By the time polls opened, officials in both parties had taken up positions in even the farthest election outposts.</p>
        <p>Some 300,000 people live in the concrete block houses outside Orizaba. They are mostly farmers, who grow flowers, potatoes and corn on a few acres. A few residents work from home as butchers or seamstresses, or operating taco stands or minimarkets. Most of those interviewed said they earned less than $4 a day.</p>
        <p>Almost unanimously, they complain about living in poverty and about feeling abandoned by the government -- except at election time. Many expressed a desire for change.</p>
        <p>''My parents have supported the PRI as long as I have been alive, and we live in the same misery as always,'' said Alvaro Gonzalez Arenas, 24, a member of the PAN who hopes to run for mayor of Mariano Escobedo later this year. ''Most of us make just enough to eat.''</p>
        <p>At least 400 residents of Mariano Escobedo started Election Day at church where the Rev. Ruben Gomez Guijarro told the congregation that their votes were worth much more than the bread, clothes or construction materials they had been offered.</p>
        <p>Jose Luis Quijano, a 32-year-old potato farmer, said he would vote for the PAN. In front of the church, he pointed to a simple block of a building with no windows and a collapsed roof. That, he said, was where his two children went to school. He said he had paid -- in vain -- at least $15 over the last six months to local officials to help repair it.</p>
        <p>''No matter what promises the PRI will make, I will not vote for them,'' he added. ''They cannot deceive me anymore.''</p>
        <p>There seemed more support for the PRI a few miles away, in La Perla. Many people leaving the polls said they supported the ruling party. And Adrian Esteban Jimenez, the mayor, was not ashamed to say that government assistance was central.</p>
        <p>Pablo Duran Mora had walked six hours to vote in La Perla, and was still unsure who he would pick. He said he was frustrated by the lack of technical support from the government to poor farmers like him. Yet he was unconvinced that life would change if he voted against the PRI.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, it seemed, most people were up for taking a risk. After all, said Clemente Velasquez, a 56-year-old butcher, how much can a man lose when he lives on a few dollars a day? ''We cannot go on,'' he said. ''For better or worse, we have to try something new.''</p>
