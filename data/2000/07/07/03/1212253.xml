        <p>Marjon van Grunsven described ''Unseen,'' performed by her Memento company on Saturday night at the Joyce SoHo, as ''a dance allegory peering into the secret life of dolls.'' To communicate so many levels of meaning would be a difficult task for the most experienced choreographer. Ms. van Grunsven, a Dutch-trained dancer, choreographer and teacher who has been working in New York since 1994, did not pull it off.</p>
        <p>The new eveninglong piece might have worked better if it had trusted a simple story to communicate the ''unseen,'' as George Balanchine did in ''The Steadfast Tin Soldier.'' Instead Ms. van Grunsven and her 14 female dancers suggested doll-like behavior by intermittently hanging by their hands from stretchy marionette strings and jerking their bodies as if they were jointed. There was also a good deal of falling and rising and rushing on and off the stage for ranks of mostly undifferentiated dancers. The message of the piece, drawn from jazz and modern dance and set to classical, ethnic and light jazz music, was unclear.</p>

        <p>That was a pity, because Memento included several small spitfire technicians and one tall woman who came on for a solo at the end and danced with an airy amplitude that made one want to see more of her in other choreography.</p>
