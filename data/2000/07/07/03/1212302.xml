        <p>John Rocker and the rest of the Atlanta Braves spent four days in New York, and lived to tell about it.</p>
        <p>The Braves' relief pitcher appeared in only one of the four games with the Mets at Shea Stadium -- the first one -- and one of his teammates thought that was the perfect outcome.</p>
        <p>''There were 300 media people here and he pitches Thursday night and half the people aren't here the next day,'' said Tom Glavine, the veteran starter. ''That alleviated a lot of it. I don't think the fans here are going to give up on it. And that's fine. If the fans want to do their things, we expect that. But I think a lot of the extra emphasis that was put on this situation died down after John pitched Thursday night.''</p>
        <p>Rocker would have been called into Friday night's game, an 11-8 Mets victory, but a callus on his left thumb broke open, and he did not pitch the rest of the series.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be an ongoing process,'' Glavine said of the attention Rocker receives from members of the news media. ''This is going to be an all-year situation. We want to make it a better situation for us to concentrate on what we should be concentrating on, and that's baseball. Hopefully, he'll realize that.''</p>
        <p>In other words, his teammates hope Rocker will keep his thoughts to himself for the rest of the season and not stir the controversy again, as he did a few weeks ago when he berated the Sports Illustrated reporter who quoted Rocker's views on gays, foreigners, unwed mothers and members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>Rocker did make an on-field appearance yesterday, warming up left fielder Reggie Sanders in the eighth inning, tossing a ball back and forth while a stadium security guard stood behind him and several police officers hovered outside the door to the visitors' bullpen.</p>
        <p>When Rocker was finished, he flipped the ball into the stands in the left-field corner and left the field. Members of the crowd chanted, ''Throw it back,'' and a fan fired a ball on to the field.</p>
        <p>The police arrested Gregory Sweeney, 25, of the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, and charged him with reckless endangerment.</p>
        <p>Despite the arrest, Major League Baseball officials were pleased that no serious incidents arose during the series. Kevin Hallinan, baseball's security chief, said that he and his expanded staff kept an inning-by-inning checklist to make sure they covered all possible danger points.</p>
        <p>Hallinan said the New York City police had been prepared to ring the field after the games, but found that maneuver unnecessary.</p>
