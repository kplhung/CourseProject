        <p>IMAGES of women, selected at random (O.K., not totally at random) from recent newspaper and television accounts:</p>
        <p>A reprint of recipes for Tipper Gore's Ginger Snaps and Laura Bush's Texas Governor's Mansion Cowboy Cookies, as originally run in Family Circle.</p>
        <p>A news story about Jeanine F. Pirro, the district attorney of Westchester, seeing her career in ruins after her husband's conviction for tax fraud.</p>
        <p>Reports that women are increasingly comfortable wearing less in the office.</p>
        <p>A feature story about a bosom lift, accompanied by assessments of the varying virtues of push-up bras.</p>
        <p>An excerpt on WNBC-TV from an amateur video, which seemed to show that among the many women terrified by marauding men in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, two or three women enjoyed displaying various parts of their anatomy.</p>
        <p>And so on.</p>
        <p>What is wrong with these pictures? Just about everything. It is a sad fact that still, not only do men not know what women want, women don't know, either. A broad generalization, of course. Many women know just what they want.</p>
        <p>But oh, what society does to us. What we do to ourselves.</p>
        <p>This comes to mind now because recently, speaking at Baruch College, Geraldine A. Ferraro said, as she has before, that she was subjected to some of the scrutiny she endured as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in 1984 only because she is a woman. Just as Hillary Rodham Clinton has said that a woman has a more difficult time running for office than a man does.</p>
        <p>These assertions are difficult to refute. It is still true that strong men are assertive; strong women are strident. Thoughtful men are flexible; thoughtful women are indecisive. It is still true that a female candidate is suspect.</p>
        <p>But it's more complicated than stereotypes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ferraro wasn't quite ready for prime time. She delayed releasing her income tax returns (a result of her accountant's diligence, she now says), made things worse for herself by acting as if probing questions were invasions of privacy and was simply unprepared for the onslaught of critical attention.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pirro was not only a victim of her husband's financial games, but also a beneficiary, who, trial testimony suggested, knew or should have known about the schemes to defraud the government of more than $400,000 by deducting the family's personal expenses as business write-offs.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton wants it both ways. She wants to be judged for her own accomplishments. But she piggybacks on her husband's career, was his fierce defender and, having never run for political office before, is trying to start near the top in a state not her own.</p>
        <p>There is pattern here, of women in public life seeing themselves as both independent and victimized; as speechmaker and cookie baker; aggressor and martyr. Of course they do. They don't live in isolation.</p>
        <p>IN the very public profession of politics, whose practitioners (male and female) are subject to intense scrutiny by the opposition and the news media, women still have to fight deeply ingrained stereotypes. Unfair. As Mrs. Ferraro noted, if a female politician has children, she's accused of neglecting them, and if she is single, she should expect rumors that she is a lesbian. Mrs. Clinton was never more popular than when she was a victim. Another cliche -- woman as victim.</p>
        <p>But women contribute to their own stereotyping: Mrs. Ferraro saying that her husband handled all the family finances. Or Mrs. Clinton and Mrs. Pirro ''standing by'' their men.</p>
        <p>Which is it, independent woman or loyal wife? Thing is, society forces women in public life to be both. Most play along, and not just in public life.</p>
        <p>Of course some women respond eagerly to marketers of push-up bras. Or think they can get away with wearing revealing clothes in the corporate suite. Or even assume it's fine to bare all in public. And still have careers outside the home and still be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>It would be nice indeed if women could do as they wished. Imagine for a moment the average female politician being as routinely unimpressive as the average male politician. Or a woman in public office confessing to marital infidelity and remaining popular. Someday. Maybe when a woman in politics concedes that she buys her ginger snaps.</p>
