        <p>Read-Rite, an electronic components maker in Milpitas, Calif., has been in no position to complain whenever fluctuations in electrical service shut down a vital computer-controlled milling machine. After all, the local utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has lived up to its contractual obligation to keep the power flowing and to prevent voltage surges or dips of 10 percent or more.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the milling machine, which helps Read-Rite make the tiny devices that read and write information on computer disk drives, crashes if voltages vary as little as 5 percent. And such flutters have occasionally occurred the last two years as Pacific Gas, a unit of the PG&amp;E Corporation, has performed its daily juggling act of matching power demand and supply in the region. So far, Read-Rite's solution has been to monitor the incoming power closely and adjust settings on the milling equipment manually.</p>
        <p>''We have to watch it closely because we can lose materials worth thousands of dollars,'' said Shahzad Mahmud, director of facilities.</p>
        <p>Read-Rite's milling machine is indicative of a long-running, but accelerating problem: the nation's electrical power supply system is not up to the task of meeting the digital economy's needs. While the utility industry has historically prided itself on delivering fairly stable power 99.9 percent of the time, today's computerized economy is demanding even fewer interruptions and a much steadier current.</p>
        <p>That is because electricity is more than just energy for computers -- it is the medium they use to do their job. Rapid, minute changes in voltage represent the ones and zeros that make up digital information.</p>
        <p>Those patterns are ultimately translated into a human voice during a phone call, a calculation during a banking transaction, a dose of radiation during cancer therapy or a photo of a new baby e-mailed to scattered relatives. Any disruption in the power supply that compromises the processor's ability to manage those voltages can lead to lost data or system crashes.</p>
        <p>Power disturbances around the world cause more than 17,000 computer disruptions every second, from annoying frozen cursors to serious destruction of equipment, according to the latest calculations of American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., which began building backup power systems for computer users in 1984.</p>
        <p>''What we have worked well for an economy that ran on motors and lights,'' said Peter Gross, a leading designer of giant telecommunications hubs, data centers and other buildings that operate around the clock. ''There's a major disconnect with what's happening in the digital world.''</p>
        <p>There is also an explosion of interest in technologies and services that address the new economy's power needs. And the remedies go well beyond the surge suppressors that most home PC users employ to protect their computers during lightning or voltage spikes. The solutions aimed at businesses include backup generators manufactured by companies like Caterpillar and smaller power supplies from American Power Conversion and the Liebert unit of Emerson Electric. There are innovative fuel cells from start-ups like FuelCell Energy; new flywheels from Active Power and Beacon Power and a variety of battery improvements. Companies like International Rectifier and Ixys are finding strong demand for new microchips that manage power equipment.</p>
        <p>The computer-driven economy's push to transform the electricity business adds up to a $500 billion opportunity for the companies selling into it, according to Mark P. Mills, a Washington-based consultant who, along with Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, coined the term ''powercosm'' to describe the evolving market. The two men jointly publish The Digital Power Report for the Gilder Group.</p>
        <p>The message certainly is resonating on Wall Street. International Rectifier has soared from less than $12 last summer to more than $55. Ixys, a smaller competitor that was hovering around $3 in November, reached $69 last Tuesday. Start-ups like H Power, a fuel-cell maker, and Active Power are on the runway for public offerings this summer, hoping to find the same kind of welcome as Capstone Turbine, which went public on Thursday at $16 a share and ended the week at $45.0625. Meanwhile, giants like General Electric and the deregulated arms of numerous utilities have been pouring venture capital into the field.</p>
        <p>The expansion of the digital economy is causing electrical headaches in two ways. The most straightforward is that it drives up demand for electricity in regions like the Northeast where capacity is already strained in the peak summer months. Last week, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for example, Consolidated Edison shut off service to eight apartment buildings and lowered its voltage in the neighborhood for several hours on a hot, muggy day.</p>
        <p>The rising demand involves much more than air-conditioning, of course. Consider the transformation of a 16-story building in downtown Newark, which formerly housed a Macy's department store and consumed roughly 10 watts of power a square foot before the store was shut down in 1992.</p>
        <p>Now, the upper floors have been reopened as a ''telecommunications hotel'' where companies like WorldCom, IDT, Qwest and Level 3 Communications park rows of data servers, routers and other electronic equipment, as well as cooling systems, backup power and other devices. According to Public Service Electric and Gas, the local utility, such users require 40 to 50 watts a square foot.</p>
        <p>One developer looking at another site in North Jersey for the home of a potential million-square-foot data and communications center asked Public Service for 100 megawatts of power, according to Patrick Downs, the utility's vice president for operations support. ''That's one-third of what we give the whole city of Newark,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, even the most extravagant estimates of the new economy's impact on sheer demand put the level at less than 10 percent of the total capacity of traditional utilities. To energy managers, engineers like Mr. Gross and, more recently, Wall Street, the volume of demand for power is less noteworthy than the higher quality of electricity that digital users are insisting upon.</p>
        <p>''Three nines is great for the grid,'' Mr. Mills said, referring to 99.9 percent reliability, or roughly eight hours of power losses a year. Indeed, it is hard to imagine this figure becoming much better, given the vulnerability of power supply grids to bad weather, animals shorting out transformers and other equipment and drunken drivers hitting utility poles.</p>
        <p>But even ''three nines,'' Mr. Mills said, is ''trash for a computer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills's prescription for microprocessor-friendly power quality is 10 nines, or 99.99999999 percent reliability -- a mere 32 seconds of power loss a year -- plus equipment to protect against those gaps and the sags, spikes and surges in between.</p>
        <p>So great is the cost of computer disruptions to the economy that the sale of services or equipment to prevent such problems is starting to be seen as a can't-miss proposition for those with the right technology.</p>
        <p>''When the Model T was introduced, people didn't worry about the grade of gasoline,'' said Larry R. Wilson, director of strategic planning for the electric power unit of Caterpillar. The invention of high-performance cars changed that, Mr. Wilson said, and now the same thing is happening on a much broader scale with electricity.</p>
        <p>''Where people have a power quality need, price is not an issue,'' Mr. Wilson said. He predicts strong growth for Caterpillar's generator sales to a ''premium'' market of users for whom price is no object when it comes to reliable backup energy. Such users are willing to pay the equivalent of $20 a kilowatt for backup supplies, compared with about 7 cents a kilowatt, on average, for electricity drawn directly from the utility grid.</p>
        <p>Although it varies by state around the nation, utility regulators generally define a momentary power loss as one lasting one to five minutes. Such interruptions can cause havoc in stock-trading systems, automated paper mills and other computer-driven processes unless there are backup power generators and equipment to switch to them seamlessly.</p>
        <p>But in many cases, trouble does not wait for an outright power loss. A voltage dip of just 10 percent, with no interruption, can cause problems for some systems in a sixth of a second, according to Marek Samotyj, who manages power quality programs for the Electric Power Research Institute, a Palo Alto, Calif. research group owned by utility companies. And some sensors in medical equipment fail if current is cut off completely for as little as four milliseconds, he said.</p>
        <p>Even as the crowd of suppliers that offer remedies swells, the question of who will pay for better power is very much unsettled.</p>
        <p>Last year, American Electric Power, a large utility based in Columbus, Ohio, and the equipment maker Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution began studying  what combination of monitoring equipment and system improvements would be required to supply premium-quality power to an industrial park in Delaware, Ohio. American Electric's goals included learning whether premium power could command premium prices, according to Harry Vollkommer, one of the project managers for the utility.</p>
        <p>But James Osteen, senior industrial engineer at the Nippert Company, a wire manufacturer that is one of the major utility customers in the park, does not see a more stable power supply as a premium product. He said all companies were expected to improve quality continually these days, and the utility should be no exception. ''Our expectation is that we won't pay more for premium power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A similar attitude prevails in Detroit. In order to keep business from the Big Three auto companies, Detroit Edison is currently supplying power under a contract that penalizes it if it fails to steadily reduce the number of power losses and fluctuations. The number of power losses at General Motors has been reduced by two-thirds since the contract began in 1995, and Detroit Edison has improved enough to avoid any penalties so far for power sags, according to John C. Anderson, director of energy services for G.M.</p>
        <p>Addressing the new economy's power needs, however, is not simply a matter of improving the utility grid. Studies show that 70 percent of disruptions originate from electrical problems at customer sites, according to Richard P. Bingham, a manager at Dranetz-BMI, a power quality products and consulting company, in Edison, N.J.</p>
        <p>''Laser printers often take out computers when the heater comes on,'' said Mr. Bingham, citing but one example. Electronic ballasts in overhead lighting and compressors in soda machines also cause unexpected loads. And electronic devices, like drives that adjust speeds on motors to save energy, generate electrical interference on the lines that power them. The interference, known as harmonic signals, can trip up other equipment unless it is canceled by filtering devices. And many schools, he said, are creating problems for themselves by overloading their electrical systems with new electronic equipment.</p>
        <p>The variety of problems and the public's dwindling patience with disruptions means that trouble-shooters like Dranetz-BMI can no longer restrict themselves to the utility-dominated world, where the person on the other end of the phone is generally an engineer. ''There are a lot more people with less and less knowledge of electricity calling me with questions,'' Mr. Bingham said.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  July 7, 2000, Friday  An article in Business Day on Monday about the challenge of maintaining a reliable flow of electricity to meet the needs of the computerized economy miscalculated the amount of time that a user would be without electricity if the power supply were 99.99999999 percent reliable. It would be 0.0032 of a second a year, not 32 seconds.</p>
        <p>The article also described FuelCell Energy incorrectly. The company, which changed its name last September, was founded in 1969 as the Energy Research Corporation. It is not a start-up company. A chart with the article provided an outdated list of the company's products; it spun off its battery business as Evercel Inc. last year.</p>
