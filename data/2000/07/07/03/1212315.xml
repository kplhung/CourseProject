        <p>The thin-crust margherita pizza had yet to arrive and the lunch bunch was, as usual, wrangling. Amiably for now: heated could always come later. The topic of the instant was not Hillary or Rudy, not even Amadou Diallo: it was the value of their half-century of friendship. ''It's worth zero, dollar-wise,'' asserted Abraham D. Beame, the former mayor and quintessential certified public accountant.</p>
        <p>''Yes, but it has given us psychic profit,'' said Milton Mollen, the former presiding justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''It gives us a chance to kick around various problems,'' said Julius C. C. Edelstein, senior vice chairman emeritus of City University of New York.</p>
        <p>''That's just it,'' said S. Stanley Kreutzer, former chief counsel to the New York State Legislature. ''It is so important to be in touch.''</p>
        <p>And are they ever: four indomitable pols (collective age: 355 years) who once pulled the levers of power, and who now refuse to let rain nor sleet nor gloom of medical checkups  deter them from the swift completion of their appointed Round Table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beame is 94. Mr. Kreutzer is 93. Mr. Edelstein is 88. ''We were around when Methuselah was young,'' said Mr. Kreutzer, deadpan.</p>
        <p>''Speak for yourself,'' said Mr. Mollen, the baby of the group at 80. ''I'm the kid in the crowd.''</p>
        <p>For years their twice-monthly tablecloth meeting has been a fixture at Fresco by Scotto, the power-lunch place on East 52nd Street in Manhattan. They spin yarns, drop names, share secrets and dissect everything old and new under the Gotham sun, from the planned migration of The New York Times three blocks south (''At least it's in the neighborhood,'' said Mr. Kreutzer) to the legacy of the Rockefeller drug laws (''Haven't worked,'' said Mr. Mollen).</p>
        <p>They have known one other forever -- or at least, since the 1950's, which nowadays is nearly the same thing. Such is their clout that they are routinely accorded deference, salutations and power-shoulder-squeezes from regulars at other tables at Fresco, including other pols, such as Alfonse M. D'Amato; David N. Dinkins; the  Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden; the developers Lewis Rudin and Jonathan Tisch; and television  V.I.P.'s like Barbara Walters and Matt Lauer.</p>
        <p>They insist that there isn't really a name for the lunch group. There are no agendas, no position papers, no meeting notes. They vehemently deny that they are curmudgeons (although ''codger'' might fly, they cheerfully allow) and they make few concessions to age. If hearing aids are defeated by the boisterous lunchtime crowd, they communicate in their own telepathic shorthand. Hands sometimes tremble a bit as they tuck into the Caesar salad; nevertheless, as Mr. Edelstein put it, ''all our stories are intact.''</p>
        <p>By their dogged persistence and the unflagging tumult of their convocations, they have helped ward off the extinction of pre-millennial politics. In a time when the name Robert F. Wagner no longer commands a large share of New York mind, they keep alive that city they served for so long, and, in truth, still love.</p>
        <p>Thus it was on a recent afternoon, when they convened shortly before 1 p.m. ''We always order the same thing,'' said Mr. Beame. ''The Caesar salad and a margherita.'' Pause for effect. ''Pizza, that is.'' A punch line better spoken than written.</p>
        <p>''No margherita for me,'' said Mr. Mollen, eyeing the menu the way he used to view interrogation transcripts when he headed the Mollen Commission, the eponymous 1992-to-1994 investigation of city police corruption. ''I exercise a little independence,''</p>
        <p>''About pizza,'' said Mr. Edelstein, ''he's very independent.''</p>
        <p>''Not at all'' -- that music-hall pause again -- ''he's a Democrat,'' topped Mr. Beame.</p>
        <p>Although they have the advantage of close on a century of perspective about the city, they still tap sources to help them remain au courant. ''Financially, the city is in great shape right now, compared to the '70's,'' said Mr. Beame. ''But I'm getting reports that in a year or two there could be big budget gaps.''</p>
        <p>Talk turned to the senatorial scuffle between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio. ''This race is more star-spangled and spotlighted than any campaign I remember,'' Mr. Edelstein said. ''I look at it with amazement. In the old days, at this stage in the campaign, there would have been two reporters and not even a photographer.''</p>
        <p>They all say they'll vote for Mrs. Clinton, even though Mr. Kreutzer is still a registered Republican ''because I could never countenance Tammany,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I don't mind sitting at the same table with a Republican,'' Mr. Beame said charitably.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Mr. Kreutzer had been more than an hour late, arriving just as the group was discussing whether the city is better or worse these days. ''Today, worse,'' Mr. Kreutzer sighed, launching into a tale of blocked streets, a broken-down taxi and a clueless driver who decided ''to take a special way'' to the restaurant. ''I've seen a lifetime of traffic,'' Mr. Kreutzer said, ''and I can tell you, it's definitely worse.''</p>
        <p>His mood lightened as he took in the table groaning with antipasto, breads, thin-crust pizza and pasta. As he dug in, he continued his traffic soliloquy. ''You know, we have seen some amazing changes,'' said Mr. Kreutzer, who, as a young whippersnapper, helped to write the first New York State code of ethics in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>These words provoked a trip down memory lane. ''I remember so well the days when we had a mayor, Jimmy Walker, who could spend all his time in night clubs,'' said Mr. Edelstein, a former chief of staff for Mayor Robert F. Wagner, and before that, for Gov. Herbert Lehman. ''And Walker was admired for doing it.''</p>
        <p>As they ate, a steady stream of visitors made a pilgrimage to the table to shake hands, including Florence Henderson, the host of the ''Later Today'' program on NBC. She first met Mayor Beame ages ago when she performed at the Inner Circle shows, the political-sendup fund-raisers. They began discussing  Mr. Beame's never giving her the key to the city. ''You'll give me a key to the city next time,'' she teased him.</p>
        <p>''All I can give you right now is the key to my house,'' Mr. Beame said, raising whoops from the next table.</p>
        <p>This is a band of men who have, collectively, nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. They are no longer in the eye of the political hurricane and so ''we talk a lot about problems that need to be solved,'' said Mr. Edelstein. ''But doing anything -- that's something else again.''</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Edelstein added proudly, ''I am still a workaholic, though I don't do any legitimate work!''</p>
        <p>This is of course not true. When he isn't serving as an academic adviser in his City University office, he is writing a history of his institution.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Edelstein summed it up simply, with a benign smile, ''without work, I'd probably be dead.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Beame, he works out of his office at the Sterling National Bank in Manhattan as senior adviser. ''I'm keeping as busy as I want,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreutzer practices law on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and gives time to the Citizens Union and various civic associations. And Mr. Mollen practices law, lectures, does dispute mediation and is overseeing a bankruptcy, among other responsibilities.</p>
        <p>''I'll retire when I get older,'' he said, smiling.</p>
        <p>As lunch was rapidly consumed, the elders were pampered by several of Fresco's owners, Marion Scotto and her children Anthony Jr. and Elaina. (Mrs. Scotto got to know Mr. Beame and the others when she was a $1-a-year special-events coordinator for Mr. Golden. When the restaurant came along seven years ago, the lunch bunch came along with it.)</p>
        <p>A touch of regret arrived with more breadsticks when the talk turned to the loss of old comrades. ''Not to be maudlin about it, but we miss a lot of people,'' said Mr. Mollen. ''We talk about them. It's not depressing. The tone is -- a warm glow.'' He mentioned Mayor Wagner and Paul O'Dwyer, the former city council president during the Beame administration who became a civil-rights lawyer.</p>
        <p>''I miss Paul,'' said Mr. Edelstein.</p>
        <p>''He was in my class at law school,'' said Mr. Kreutzer, referring to St. John's University. ''I was president of the class.''</p>
        <p>To some at the table, the perspective of great age has made it ''easier to live life with as little rancor as possible,'' said Mr. Kreutzer.</p>
        <p>''My old enemies now are either dead or friends of mine,'' Mr. Edelstein said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Beame's anger has scarcely cooled after his 1970's feuding with Gov. Hugh Carey during the days when New York City was on the brink of fiscal insolvency. Mr. Beame, the first Jewish mayor of New York, was elected in 1973 but lost the primary to Edward I. Koch in 1977. The former accounting teacher, city budget director and comptroller had been elected as the candidate who ''knows the buck.'' He still strongly believes that others tried to make him the scapegoat for the city's fulminating financial crisis. And he still lays his defeat to the opposition of Mr. Carey.</p>
        <p>''I never have any association with him,'' said Mr. Beame. ''If we're in the same room, I wouldn't go over to him.''</p>
        <p>But though those at the table have been on different sides of the issues through the years, they harbor no animus. Which is not to rule out differences of opinion. ''We disagree a lot, but I wouldn't call them arguments,'' said Mr. Kreutzer.</p>
        <p>''The breadsticks here are too good to throw at each other,'' Mr. Mollen said.</p>
        <p>''In the old days we used to argue about politics,'' Mr. Edelstein said. ''Now we argue about who gets the last piece of pizza.''</p>
        <p>So is breaking bread the true fountain of youth? No, agrees the lunch bunch, the key is forward motion.</p>
        <p>''New York has endured,'' Mr. Edelstein said. ''And we, too, are still going.''</p>
        <p>There was a pause. ''But I think we are too busy to reflect on all the big changes,'' Mr. Beame said.</p>
        <p>''So,'' said Mr. Edelstein, ''we just live our lives and do the best we can each day.''</p>
        <p>It was 2:30 p.m., time for the rush for the door to begin. It was strictly Dutch, and the cashier was, of course, Mr. Beame. ''Call me,'' Mr. Edelstein said as he pushed back from the table, ''and we'll set another date!''</p>
