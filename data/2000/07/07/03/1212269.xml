        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Having a Blast  Long before Independence Day, fireworks were a feature of all sorts of celebrations, from coronations and military triumphs to noble marriages and the entry of a ruler into a city. Artists like Claude Lorrain, Piranesi, Winslow Homer and Degas incorporated pyrotechnics in their works. Through Sept. 17, more than 100 prints and drawings depicting fireworks displays from the 16th to the early 20th centuries are on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in ''Fireworks! Four Centuries of Pyrotechnics in Prints and Drawings.'' Information: (212) 535-7710.</p>

        <p>All That Jazz  Starting on Friday, a 10-day festival will fill the clubs, streets and parks of Denmark's capital with the sounds of jazz. Drawing fans and musicians from around the world, the Copenhagen Jazz Festival offers traditional jazz, bebop, modern jazz, rhythm-and-blues, swing, vocal jazz, world jazz and more at some 500 concerts, most of them free. Information: 011-45-33-93-2013.</p>
        <p>Family Decor  Magnificent paintings by Botticelli, van Dyck, Poussin, Watteau and others. Russian icons. Classical antiquities. Palace furnishings. These treasures beckon at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, where ''Stroganoff: The Palace and Collections of a Russian Noble Family'' opened yesterday for a run through Oct. 1. Drawn from the collections of the State Hermitage Museum, the State Russian Museum, imperial palaces and other Russian institutions, most of the 230 masterworks have not left Russia for centuries. Information: (817) 332-8451.</p>
        <p>Silver Celebration  When the Glimmerglass Opera began in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1975, its first presentation was ''La Boheme'' by Puccini. On Friday the company will open its 25th anniversary season with a new production of ''La Boheme'' at the Alice Busch Opera Theater. Other attractions include ''The Glass Blowers'' by John Philip Sousa, opening on Saturday; Richard Strauss's ''Salome,'' beginning on July 22; and Handel's ''Acis and Galatea,'' opening on July 29. Information: (607) 547-2255.</p>
        <p>Satchmo's Time  All his life, Louis Armstrong believed he had been born on the Fourth of July 1900. Only after his death in 1971 was it discovered that his true birthday was Aug. 4, 1901. But that isn't stopping the listener-supported Columbia University radio station, WKCR (89.9 FM), from celebrating the great jazzman's unofficial centennial with 184 hours of his music. The party began on Friday at 5 a.m. and will last until 9 p.m. this Friday. Information: (212) 854-9290.</p>
