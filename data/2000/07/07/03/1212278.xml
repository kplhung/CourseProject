        <p>Raychelle Burwell and this boy were going out. They did not actually go anywhere, of course. Just talked on the phone, passed notes in class. Locked eyes. Held hands.</p>
        <p>But all their friends at the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a charter school in the Hyde Park section of Boston, thought they should kiss. On the lips. ''They pressured me so much,'' Raychelle recalled. ''I was like, 'No, no. . . .' ''</p>
        <p>Then one day Raychelle's sixth-grade class found itself alone in the room, waiting for the teacher. She was out of excuses. Their mouths met.</p>
        <p>''Don't you know, the teacher walked in the classroom,'' Raychelle said, horrified even in the retelling. The 13-year-old girl landed in front of the principal, who called her grandmother. ''I broke up,'' Raychelle said, ''because I figured he was bad luck.''</p>
        <p>These are the more familiar pressures of sixth grade, the backdrop against which the new stresses from standardized tests and college competition are set.</p>
        <p>There are raging hormones and new responsibilities, the fading of old friendships and the unspoken formation of cliques. All of a sudden, appearance counts. Girls are trying on bras, some getting their periods. Boys, meanwhile, eagerly await promised growth spurts. Peer pressure, whether to smoke or to cheat -- or just to fit in -- is ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>''You're not a baby anymore,'' said Ebony Rosser, 12, a student at Stephenson Middle School in DeKalb County, Ga., outside Atlanta. ''You're getting more experiences. Nobody's going to take you by the hand.''</p>
        <p>They are reluctant romantics. On the one hand, sixth graders long for the simplicity of kindergarten, when, as Meredith Keller of Fairfax County, Va., put it, the only thing anyone fought over was who got the green crayon. At the same time, they are newly curious about each other.</p>
        <p>''You walk down the hall, you see couples everywhere,'' Diane Robles, 11, said of her middle school, Desert Shadows, on the border with Mexico in Nogales, Ariz. Diane has even heard about a relationship between a sixth grader and an eighth grader.</p>
        <p>''It was about to go very far,'' she said. ''Then they broke up.''</p>
        <p>Boy-girl parties have begun, and truth or dare is alive and well. In Queens, students were worried that on a coming school trip to Hot Skates, a Long Island roller rink, you could not skate without a date.</p>
        <p>The first French kiss, however awkward, remains a sixth-grade institution -- but not for everyone.</p>
        <p>''I wish I had somebody,'' lamented Sean Ellis, Diane's classmate at Desert Shadows.</p>
        <p>The budding relationships, such as they are, sometimes poison longtime friendships.</p>
        <p>''Like Patrick and Suzy's case,'' said Toni Grdovic, 12, who attends Public School 21 in Flushing, Queens. ''They've been going out for four months. And I think Tiffany did something with Patrick.'' One morning before the bell, the girls hurled curses, and a school security guard had to break things up. ''People were screaming 'Jerry, Jerry,' as if it was 'The Jerry Springer Show,' '' Toni recalled.</p>
        <p>In sixth grade, popularity is a varsity sport.</p>
        <p>At Oaklands Elementary in Prince George's County, Md., the boys rate the girls, 1 to 10, and the 9's and 10's rule the school. It is mostly about looks, but sense of humor counts. Elsewhere, the rich kids with their Abercrombie &amp; Fitch shirts are in charge. The smartest students, once admired, begin their descent into geekdom.</p>
        <p>''There's dorks and there's cool people,'' said Matthew Goldstein, 12, of Teague Middle School in Altamonte Springs, Fla., outside Orlando. ''Before it was just you're friends with whoever.''</p>
        <p>Lindsey Carmen's eyes were sad behind her glasses as she talked about being picked on and left out. ''It's so difficult not being popular,'' said Lindsey, an Oaklands student. ''It's one of the most depressing things.</p>
        <p>''I'm sort of learning,'' Lindsey continued, ''that if they don't like me the way I am, they can find their own friends.''</p>
