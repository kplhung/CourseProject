        <p>''How do you say the name?'' Sal Carr asked as he eased the motorboat through the Marine Basin Marina in Brooklyn Saturday evening and out into Gravesend Bay.</p>

        <p>''How do you say the name?'' Sal Carr asked as he eased the motorboat through the Marine Basin Marina in Brooklyn Saturday evening and out into Gravesend Bay.</p>
        <p>''Bat'kivshchyna,'' Taras Szczur said. ''Bat-keev-SHIN-a.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr, a marina tenant who had agreed to take Mr. Szczur, the OpSail 2000 liaison to the schooner Bat'kivshchyna, on a reconnaissance ride around the harbor, tuned the radio to Channel 9.</p>
        <p>''Ummm, Bak-ta-chinn-ee,'' he called out to every vessel within 50 miles. ''Ukraine ship. Are you out there? Ukraine sail, are you out there? Are you out there?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carr released the talk button. ''They don't have a cell phone?''</p>
        <p>Actually they did. But it wasn't on. Or it wasn't working. Or -- come to think of it, Mr. Szczur (pronounced shoor) recalled -- ''they were asking me for a battery charger right before they left Baltimore.''</p>
        <p>But no matter. The Bat'kivshchyna would arrive. The captain, Dmytro Biriukovich, would make sure of it. He had never lost faith, not when the ship ran aground in the Dnieper River a few days into the trip and lost a big chunk of its keel, as well as a toilet. Nor when storms in the Mediterranean shredded the mainsail.</p>
        <p>Nor when the ship lost satellite phone service near Spain, nor when the radio gave up the ghost somewhere in the Atlantic, triggering a two-week oceanwide search by the Coast Guard. Nor when a mysterious problem, either with the winds or with reading the instructions for the Global Positioning System, caused the Bat'kivshchyna to miss the opening parade of OpSail 2000 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by about 1,400 miles and end up in Norfolk, Va.</p>
        <p>''It's normal seaman problem,'' the captain, a courtly 63-year-old in spotless whites and a skipper's hat, said on Wednesday as he stood on the deck in Baltimore. ''I don't like to explain, 'Oh, how it was hard, waah waah waah.' I found this way. I have found it.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's grand Parade of Sail through New York Harbor will feature hundreds of the most imposing vessels on the planet, from a 371-foot Chilean barkentine to President Clinton's aircraft carrier.</p>
        <p>And then there is the Bat'kivshchyna, the official, if utterly unfinanced, representative of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>A floating testament to either the indomitability of the human spirit or the primacy of Murphy's Law, the Bat'kivshchyna, a 90-foot metal-hulled former fishing trawler dipped in cement and topped with two masts, left Kiev on April 7 with a crew of 15, counting the captain's wife and 14-year-old grandson. How it made it across the Atlantic is still unclear.</p>
        <p>''In yachting life,'' Captain Biriukovich (beer-yoo-KOH-vich), a retired civil engineer, had philosophized in Baltimore, ''some days bad and some days good. We forget bad and remember good.''</p>
        <p>The Bat'kivshchyna left Baltimore on Thursday for a 200-mile run to New York, a hop and a skip for a ship that had already covered 8,000 miles as the albatross flies. But though it was expected in Brooklyn midday Saturday, there was still no sign of it yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Roy Kellogg, the captain's son-in-law, and (to his frequent chagrin these last three months) the Bat'kivshchyna's one-man land crew, was hardly surprised.</p>
        <p>''This is how it is with them,'' said Mr. Kellogg, 46. ''Everything is 'Don't worry, be happy.' My father-in-law and his Jamaican attitude.''</p>
        <p>When OpSail's organizers were putting the event together, they sent invitations to dozens of foreign governments. In January they began getting calls from a man who wanted to teach the world about the wonders of Ukraine from aboard a boat he had built called Bat'kivshchyna. (It means ''motherland.'')</p>
        <p>''We didn't know they existed,'' said Alma Viator, OpSail 2000's director of international and government affairs. ''They were not on my radar screen.''</p>
        <p>At least she has a radar screen. The Bat'kivshchyna had no radar, virtually no communication equipment, and no corporation or nonprofit foundation willing to sponsor it. Asking the Ukrainian government for a handout was out of the question.</p>
        <p>''We have many problems now in our country,'' Captain Biriukovich said. ''We must give assistance, not ask for it.''</p>
        <p>After several months and a trip to the United States, he had raised about $5,500, mostly from OpSail itself, about a tenth of what a voyage of this magnitude typically costs. (Donors and sponsors may send e-mail messages to Cfue@webtv.net.)</p>
        <p>To make ends meet, the Bat'kivshchyna turns into a gift shop when it hits port, doing a brisk business in ''McLenin'' T-shirts, fake fur hats, hand-lacquered refrigerator magnets, and nesting wooden dolls of President Clinton containing Monica Lewinsky containing Paula Jones containing the first lady containing a cigar.</p>
        <p>Besides the cash flow problems, the Ukrainians found the State Department leery of issuing entry visas, given the many Ukrainians who come here as visitors and forget to leave.</p>
        <p>But Captain Biriukovich was not to be deterred. On April 7, to a hero's send-off and much news media attention, the Bat'kivshchyna set sail from Kiev, the first boat of the season to test the ice-clogged Dnieper River. The next day, Captain Biriukovich's house was burglarized.</p>
        <p>On Day 7, the boat slammed aground when the helmsman fell asleep at the wheel. Minus a piece of its keel, Bat'kivshchyna soldiered on.</p>
        <p>''It looks not so pretty,'' a crew member, Sergei Sklonchak, said of the black-hulled gaff-rigged boat, ''but it is very strong. It has big, heavy metal body. Like a tank.''</p>
        <p>The mishaps continued. There was a near-international incident in Turkey, after the Ukrainian Coast Guard sank a Turkish fishing ship it said had been poaching in Ukraine waters, and the Turks vowed revenge. Keen to avoid Turkish gunfire, the Bat'kivshchyna slipped through the Bosporus in the dead of night. There were storms in the Mediterranean so severe that a crew member jumped ship in Cadiz, Spain.</p>
        <p>Now the communication problems began. The ship's satellite phone stopped working after the phone company was sold and the customers were not automatically switched over. And on May 13, shortly after the ship transmitted a position 250 miles west of the Canary Islands, the radio went dead.</p>
        <p>The seafaring community feared the worst. The Coast Guard sent search planes clear to Africa. The first in a series of OpSail events opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico, without the Bat'kivshchyna.</p>
        <p>In the mid-Atlantic, Captain Biriukovich, cut off from the world, made a decision. The seas were freakishly calm, and he was running low on fuel. He would skip Puerto Rico and Miami and make a beeline for Norfolk.</p>
        <p>At least that was the official story. Several crew members said that in fact, someone on board had set the Global Positioning System to take a reading off a European satellite rather than off an American satellite, with disorienting results.</p>
        <p>''We thought we went to the south,'' said Katya Dvornichenko, 21, the only woman in the crew other than the captain's wife, Nina. ''When we met another ship and we took coordinates from him, he told us that we were 1,000 miles north. There was some joking that we will go to Greenlandia and that we will see some icebergs.''</p>
        <p>There was disappointment. ''We missed Puerto Rico, which was my dream,'' said Gena Vovk, 24, who runs the souvenir concession. ''We missed Miami, place of my dreams. We can sell everything in Miami.''</p>
        <p>But on June 6, navigating without radar in heavy fog, the Bat'kivshchyna pulled into Norfolk. It was either 17 days late for the start of OpSail or 8 days early for the festivities in Norfolk.</p>
        <p>It did not matter. They were an immediate hit, and Virginians fell all over themselves to help them. One man took a 55-gallon drum of diesel fuel from his backyard down to the dock. After a local minister told his flock that the Ukrainians were short on provisions, the ship took on so much food that the crew worried that it would sink.</p>
        <p>Baltimore brought more of the same. People gave the crew coolers of beer, cartons of cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Visitors to the ship were greeted by a crew member in billowy red pants, a blue velour vest, a pirate-sized ear hoop and a long blond mohawk. He played the accordion. The man, Petro Vashchyk, 53, explained that he was portraying a Cossack, though he was actually an editor for a Ukrainian television show.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Bat'kivshchyna pulled anchor and headed east, bound for the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and then the ocean. Late yesterday afternoon, Mr. Kellogg said he suspected that the captain was doing some more discovering.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be surprised if he was just sailing around the harbor looking at New York City,'' Mr. Kellogg said. ''That's something my mother-in-law always wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Then, at 6:20 p.m. yesterday, the sky-blue and wheat-yellow Ukrainian flag appeared above the waters of Gravesend Bay. The Bat'kivshchyna had arrived.</p>
        <p>Captain Biriukovich, looking very refreshed, explained that he and the crew had stayed with friends in Chesapeake City, Md., for two days.</p>
        <p>''We were not in a hurry,'' he said. ''We have breakfast and we have lunch and we have dinner there.</p>
        <p>''It was wonderful,'' he added, giving two thumbs up.</p>
