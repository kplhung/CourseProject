        <p>Brown University's men's heavyweight varsity led a succession of American eight-oared victories yesterday on the final day of the Henley Royal Regatta.</p>
        <p>Racing against the Rostock and Heidelberger Rowing Club, Germany's national under-23-year-old team, in the Ladies' Challenge Plate, the regatta's second-highest standard eight-oared event, Brown shot out from the start. After the German crew rallied to take a 6-foot lead with 40 strokes left in the race over the 1O-mile course, Brown put on a final sprint to win by 6 feet, the closest finish of the regatta.</p>

        <p>In the Temple Challenge Cup, Yale's national collegiate lightweight champions took command from the first strokes and defeated Oxford Brookes by two-thirds of a boat length in 6 minutes 37 seconds.</p>
        <p>In an all-American final of the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for schoolboy eights, St. Joseph's Prep of Philadelphia fought off a persistent crew from Groton School in Connecticut to win by three-quarters of a length in 6:47.</p>
        <p>The University of Washington won the first race for women's eights in the 161-year history of Henley, defeating the University of Victoria, British Columbia, by half a boat length to win the Henley Prize.</p>
        <p>Aquil Abdullah won the oldest and most famous of single sculling events, the Diamond Challenge Sculls. Abdullah won in his second attempt at the Diamonds, defeating an unheralded English sculler, Simon Goodbrand, by two-thirds of a boat length in 8:12.</p>
