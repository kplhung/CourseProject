        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your June 27 front-page article about Banana Kelly, of which I am chairwoman, suggests that this nonprofit community development corporation in the Bronx does not enjoy the support of our neighbors and community leaders. In fact, our work is supported in the community and is recognized as a model for others. We work with the most troubled buildings and diverse populations that others shun through innovative programs in social services, education and youth development.</p>

        <p>Banana Kelly has a positive effect on the lives of thousands of families each year. We will continue to do this important work and welcome others to join us in this effort.</p>
