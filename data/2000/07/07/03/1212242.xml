        <p>LAST week, two big names in the online grocery business announced they were merging, with Webvan agreeing to pay $1.2 billion for HomeGrocer.com. Online grocers seem to be coming quickly to the realization that there is strength through scale, but significant kinks in the business continue to present big challenges to its long-term viability.</p>
        <p>Online grocery shopping beckons like an electronic Statue of Liberty to the tired, the time-pressed and the hunkered masses who consider going to the grocery an odious task. Why drive all the way to the supermarket to tangle with a shopping cart and risk getting the one with the sticky wheel when you can sit quietly at your computer and click through your choices at your convenience?</p>
        <p>The converted sing the praises of online grocery shopping, calling it convenient, reliable and, yes, no more expensive than conventional supermarket shopping. ''It probably ends up being more cost-effective because you don't pick up the things you don't need,'' said Robin Bonenfant of Norwalk, Conn., who recently began using Peapod, the Chicago online grocery pioneer that will have its 10th birthday on Wednesday. ''They take coupons as well.''</p>
        <p>Armando Quintero, a father of two who stays home with his children in San Rafael, Calif., said ordering from Webvan had simplified his life in some ways. ''They can deliver very early in the morning, so if we need lunch items for our kids, we could get them delivered before school,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, he said, he and his wife, who is at work at an office all day, ''interact online'' -- going over their electronic shopping list and adding or deleting items from their separate computers.</p>
        <p>Despite the fans, only about 2.8 percent of Americans buy their groceries online, according to estimates by Evie Black Dykema, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Among the drawbacks people typically cite are having to plan and having to think about the delivery schedule.</p>
        <p>''You have to be organized and thinking ahead,'' said Tracy Petrak, a legal secretary from San Rafael who orders occasionally from Webvan. At one point, she was surprised to receive a large postcard from the company, observing that she had not ordered in a while and asking, ''What did we do wrong?'' Webvan also sent her a $25 coupon to use on her next order, she said.</p>
        <p>Some people just do not want to give up the social opportunities or the nostalgia they associate with grocery shopping. It ties in with memories of their parents, sometimes, or contributes to a sense of community.</p>
        <p>''People feel guilt about shopping online,'' Ms. Dykema said. ''Anecdotally, there is this feeling that it's a little artificial to have their groceries sent to them. It's similar to when Procter &amp; Gamble introduced cake mixes, and they found that women wanted to add their own egg. That way, it was their own cake.''</p>
        <p>To get people to buy groceries online, companies are using a variety of models. Peapod, which appeared on the edge of extinction just three months ago when its chief executive quit suddenly and a financing deal fell apart, has now aligned itself with a traditional supermarket giant, Royal Ahold. In Fairfield County, Conn., where Mrs. Bonenfant points and clicks, Peapod used Ahold's Stop &amp; Shop stores to fill produce orders, while turning to a Peapod warehouse for other items.</p>
        <p>So thorough is the alignment that Royal Ahold owns 51 percent of Peapod, and a former Ahold executive, Marc van Gelder, is running Peapod. Mr. van Gelder seems convinced that Peapod's new model will work. ''This is a leverage of the Stop &amp; Shop chain, which stands for good value and good quality,'' he said. ''And we are also leveraging, from a procurement perspective, all the advantages you get from being linked to a $26 billion company. It is a great competitive weapon.''</p>
        <p>Stop &amp; Shop stores are also being used to promote Peapod, and the two companies are running joint advertisements. ''We do advertising in local newspapers as well as public relations and door hangings,'' Mr. van Gelder said. ''What we want to get to is to really personalize e-mail for customers. We will be able to communicate with our customers on a personalized basis.''</p>
        <p>By hooking electronic shopping so thoroughly to an old-style chain, Peapod is following the example of many European online grocers, which in many cases were started by the traditional retailers. J. Sainsbury and Tesco in Britain and Carrefour and Promodes in France, some of the biggest chains in Europe, all have online services they promote through their stores, said Jacob Jensen, a consultant with Roland Berger Associates, a consumer-products consulting firm in New York, who has studied e-grocers in Europe and in the United States.</p>
        <p>But does the model really work? Online grocery companies are typically plagued by two issues: making sure their orders are packed and delivered properly and keeping their costs down -- something that is particularly difficult when a fleet of trucks or vans is involved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jensen said creating a large warehouse, along the lines of Amazon.com, was the only way to meet the first goal effectively. The cost issue is best addressed, he said, by keeping geographic markets closely circumscribed.</p>
        <p>''From a cost perspective and from a fulfillment basis, the dedicated warehouse is the best model,'' he said. ''What really upsets the consumers is if you don't deliver the products they ordered, or if you don't hit the window you promised for delivery. And in terms of managing delivery costs, it means the route density has to be mapped out ahead of time.''</p>
        <p>One French online grocer, Tele-Market, has tried to solve the distribution issue by subcontracting its delivery service. ''They have independent couriers driving around with their products, and they take other companies' products along as well,'' Mr. Jensen said.</p>
        <p>Generally, the more deliveries in a given area, the lower the costs over all. But except for a few cities, Americans who can afford computers and Internet access are more likely to live in suburbs, if not exurbs, which means more driving for any company that offers delivery.</p>
        <p>When it comes to building critical mass for online shopping, timing may turn out to be everything.</p>
        <p>''The next wave is when these 18-  to 20-year-olds start replenishing their own households,'' Ms. Dykema said, noting how that age group already goes online to do much of its shopping, from cars to electronics to groceries. ''They can't imagine why consumers wouldn't look online first for products. They don't suffer from any of these hang-ups.''</p>
