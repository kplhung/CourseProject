        <p>If Mark Dendy had not given a title to the new work he created for the American Dance Festival, it would have been easy to enjoy it simply as a suite to a medley of pop and rock recordings of the recent past. But this premiere, which Mark Dendy Dance and Theater presented on Wednesday night at Reynolds Industries Theater on the campus of Duke University here, did have a title, ''I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now, and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed.'' The very wording of that title affected one's perception of the piece. It was still easy to enjoy. In fact, it was lots of fun.</p>
        <p>But the title also gave the exuberant cavorting an undercurrent of meaning. The action appeared to represent the fantasies of an adolescent boy who, after telling his parents he wanted to be alone, shut himself up in his room and listened to records. The dances Mr. Dendy choreographed to these records were daydreams come alive in the flesh. And for this daydreamer, getting cool in his room meant getting emotionally hot.</p>

        <p>If Mark Dendy had not given a title to the new work he created for the American Dance Festival, it would have been easy to enjoy it simply as a suite to a medley of pop and rock recordings of the recent past. But this premiere, which Mark Dendy Dance and Theater presented on Wednesday night at Reynolds Industries Theater on the campus of Duke University here, did have a title, ''I'm Going to My Room to Be Cool Now, and I Don't Want to Be Disturbed.'' The very wording of that title affected one's perception of the piece. It was still easy to enjoy. In fact, it was lots of fun.</p>
        <p>But the title also gave the exuberant cavorting an undercurrent of meaning. The action appeared to represent the fantasies of an adolescent boy who, after telling his parents he wanted to be alone, shut himself up in his room and listened to records. The dances Mr. Dendy choreographed to these records were daydreams come alive in the flesh. And for this daydreamer, getting cool in his room meant getting emotionally hot.</p>
        <p>The dancers twitched throughout the two-act production, which was commissioned by the festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work. Sober-sided adults might even think that everyone twitched too much, for much of the choreography had a sameness of texture. But no single outburst of twitching outstayed its welcome and the production was fascinating because of its unquenchable exuberance and its evocation of adolescent longings.</p>
        <p>Adolescents think a lot about sex. Therefore it was only natural that Mr. Dendy's choreography was often very sexy. Many adolescents do not know how to interpret their sexual feelings and are still uncertain of their sexual orientation. Acknowledging this, Mr. Dendy devised a striking heterosexual duet and an equally powerful homosexual one.</p>
        <p>Nicole Berger and Alexander Gish began their duet by nervously waving their arms. After drawing closer, they clung together, only to part and walk sadly away through a blizzard of falling paper snow.</p>
        <p>In another duet Mr. Gish danced with Timothy Bish as his partner. The two men prowled around the stage, eyeing each other with obvious interest. But their quiverings suggested both their sense of physical attraction and a momentary inability to come to terms with their emotions. Nevertheless, passion triumphed and embraces resulted. This duet had been preceded by a solo in which Mr. Bish, wearing the shortest of shorts, thrashed about on the floor as if consumed by desire.</p>
        <p>Throughout the production, couples embraced and soloists and groups hopped and kicked. Ms. Berger throbbed with materialistic lust to a song by Janis Joplin about an urge to possess a Mercedes-Benz. A more introverted solo, which Lawrence Keigwin choreographed for himself to music by Bill Withers, conveyed a yearning for emotional contact.</p>
        <p>The first act ended with everyone strutting in leather as the recorded voice of Lou Reed urged his listeners to ''take a walk on the wild side.'' And the second-act finale set the company leaping to a piece by Led Zeppelin called ''Rock and Roll.''</p>
