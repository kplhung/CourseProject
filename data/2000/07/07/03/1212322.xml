        <p>Hale Irwin turned 55 years old last month, which is about the age at which golfers on the Senior PGA Tour are supposed to begin their decline. They are supposed to hit a wall as their younger peers to take over.</p>
        <p>Irwin must be an exception. Instead of hitting a wall, he shot a second consecutive six-under-par 65 at Saucon Valley Country Club today to win his second United States Senior Open championship in three years, outdueling the overnight leader, Bruce Fleisher, by three shots.</p>
        <p>Thanks to an early blunder by Fleisher, Irwin wasted no time in overcoming a two-stroke deficit. He birdied the par-5 first hole, converting a 6-foot putt, as Fleisher, going for the green in 2, pushed his 3-wood approach from 270 yards into a bunker on the right.</p>
        <p>With a tree in his way, Fleisher was unable to get his third shot on the green, leading to a bogey and a tone-setting two-shot swing.</p>
        <p>Three holes later, Irwin made another birdie, the first of three straight, to seize a lead he never relinquished. He finished at 17-under 267.</p>
        <p>''It was a stupid play,'' Fleisher conceded. ''I felt if I could put some heat on him early, things may work the other way.''</p>
        <p>Irwin appreciated Fleisher's aggressive strategy.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked,'' said Irwin, who earned $400,000. ''I don't know what his thinking was. I just felt like he was so far away that awfully early in the day with a two-shot lead to try that shot. It just brought trouble into play.</p>
        <p>''It didn't work this time; it may next time. But I dare say, I bet if he was in the same position, he won't do it again.''</p>
        <p>The mistake amplified a significant difference between Irwin and Fleisher.</p>
        <p>For all his excellence on the Senior Tour since he joined in 1999 -- 10 victories and nearly $4 million in earnings -- Fleisher has yet to secure a major championship.</p>
        <p>Irwin, a three-time United States Open winner, has been known as a player who performs best under the most demanding pressure.</p>
        <p>Just two weeks earlier, in the United States Open at Pebble Beach, Irwin was the only player besides Tiger Woods to record two rounds in the 60's. He finished tied for 27th.</p>
        <p>''You don't go train for it, you don't go practice it,'' said Irwin, referring to the matter of experience. ''You don't go buy some at the store. It's immeasurable. Only way you get experience is to be there and to make mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Experience, however, wasn't the only factor that aided Irwin. He also played extremely well, hitting one outstanding approach after another on the front nine. All four of his birdies on the front came on putts of 7 feet or shorter.</p>
        <p>''He played super today,'' Fleisher said. ''There is nothing I could have done.''</p>
        <p>Nobody else was able to challenge Irwin. Tom Kite, who trailed by just three strokes entering the day, made only three birdies, shooting a 69 to finish five back, while Hubert Green and Allen Doyle, both within range, failed to break 70. Only Raymond Floyd, who shot a 67, made a move. He finished fourth, seven strokes behind Irwin.</p>
        <p>For Irwin, the victory means a lot.</p>
        <p>''My career has been defined by U.S.G.A. championships,'' said Irwin, who automatically earns a trip to next year's United States Open in Tulsa, Okla. ''If there is a tournament to win on the Senior Tour, this is it for me.''</p>
        <p>It also proves that Irwin, who takes over as the season's leading money-winner with nearly $1.5 million, may be a long way from the wall.</p>
        <p>''I think there is certainly a time period that you may be less effective than you were before,'' said Irwin, who won his first United States Senior Open in 1998 at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. ''But if somebody is going to tell me at the age of 55, 'You are not going to play golf anymore,' I just don't buy into that.''</p>
