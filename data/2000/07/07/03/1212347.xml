        <p>A Jersey City man, apparently distraught over a custody battle, killed his two young sons in their bed, then turned the gun on himself, prosecutors said last night.</p>
        <p>The boys' mother, who neighbors said had moved out several weeks ago to escape the father's violence, found the three bodies when she went to the second-floor apartment at 148 Van Horne Street last night to pick the boys up, said Terrence Hull, the first assistant Hudson County prosecutor.</p>
        <p>The names of the boys and the father, in his 30's, were not released by the authorities. But neighbors told The Star-Ledger of Newark that the father was Oscar Aquieles and the boys were his sons, Oscar, 7, and Brian, 5.</p>
        <p>Rigoberto Gutierrez, 16, who lives downstairs, said the father had recently won the right to have the boys visit him. The boys were supposed to be returned to their mother Saturday, but they were not, Mr. Gutierrez said.</p>
        <p>So yesterday, the mother came to pick them up, Mr. Gutierrez said. She found the doors locked and borrowed a knife from Mr. Gutierrez's family to pry the door open, he said.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, she was running down the stairs, screaming, ''He killed my kids, he killed my kids,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutierrez's mother, Juana Santiago, did not believe it, so she went upstairs to check, he said.</p>
        <p>''They were just laying on the bed, like he killed them when they were asleep,'' Mr. Gutierrez said his mother told him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hull said the father's body lay on the floor next to the boys' bed, with a .380-caliber gun beside him. All three were shot in the head, he said.</p>
        <p>The boy's mother was being treated at Jersey City Medical Center last night for trauma, Mr. Hull said.</p>
        <p>Last night, the sidewalks in front of the house, a three-story building with yellow siding and a weedy yard in the gritty Lafayette section, were jammed with neighbors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutierrez said that the family had lived in the apartment for about five months, and that the father worked in computers.</p>
        <p>''He seemed like a nice person,'' he said, ''but my mom is real close to the kids' mom, and she told my mom that he used to mistreat her all the time, and hit her.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutierrez said the boys were always playing -- with each other, with him, with his dog, Kiki.</p>
        <p>''They were adorable,'' he said. ''Every time I used to see them we used to start playing with them and stuff, and I'm grown. They loved that dog, too, and they would stand at the window and wave at it.''</p>
