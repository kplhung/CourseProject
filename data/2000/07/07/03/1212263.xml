        <p>Something strange has happened to the 10 p.m. newscast on Chicago's Channel 2, WBBM-TV.</p>
        <p>It was in February that the health correspondent, Dr. Michael Breen, stopped doing nightly health reports with titles like ''Potentially Deadly Fruit'' (grapefruit) and ''The Secret to a Good Sex Life'' (exercise), to focus on topics like risks associated with early prostate cancer screening (unnecessary treatment). And the weatherman, Steve Baskerville, toned down his chatty banter in favor of shorter meteorological reports.</p>
        <p>One night last month, when the other local newscasts opened with live reports from a neighborhood where the power had briefly gone out, WBBM devoted most of its early minutes to an accord between the Environmental Protection Agency and chemical manufacturers' limiting the use of a dangerous insecticide.</p>
        <p>And last Wednesday, when the other 10 p.m. programs led with stories about a nonfatal shooting of an off-duty police officer and Elian Gonzalez's return to Cuba, the Channel 2 newscast began with a lengthy report on the day's Supreme Court decisions, including one to strike down a law banning a form of  abortion.</p>
        <p>In short, the management at WBBM-TV has thrown out the local news playbook of pizazz and sensationalism used at TV stations throughout the country and replaced it with an on-air clinic in no-frills journalism.</p>
        <p>And if there is a gimmick in all of this, it is that there is no gimmick. For Channel 2, the CBS-owned station in Chicago, the restructured news program represents not so much a bold move in journalism as an attempt to increase revenue and crawl out of last place in its local news market.</p>
        <p>But it also casts the national spotlight once again on Chicago, the third-largest television market in the country -- where Jerry Springer, Siskel and Ebert and Oprah Winfrey were made famous. The no-gimmicks strategy is being studied across the nation by news directors and station managers, who have sought ways to stem the loss of viewers of their own local news programs, which can account for as much as a third of a station's advertising revenue.</p>
        <p>Some reasons for dwindling local news audiences are obvious: with 24-hour news channels and information available over the Internet at any time, the news market has simply become more competitive. Yet there is a growing sense in local TV news that another factor behind the ratings decline is a perception among viewers that the newscasts have been gradually dumbed down.</p>
        <p>The people who devised the new 10 p.m. model at WBBM, where ratings for the late evening news have plunged 70 percent since the late 1980's and are far behind its competitors' on the NBC and ABC stations, are among them. They set about developing a new 10 p.m. program last year with an eye toward righting what they saw as the wrongs of local TV journalism, hoping to prove that higher-quality news would draw a higher-quality audience -- better educated, more affluent -- worth more to advertisers.</p>
        <p>So far, it is unclear if the experiment is working. Although the program's ratings rose initially, they later dropped. But whether their effort succeeds or fails, the station's journalists say the reward has been in the journey, which has involved heavy doses of journalistic soul searching about local TV news.</p>
        <p>''I think we had lost our way, and we disappointed a lot of people who counted on us,'' Carol Marin, the program's anchor, said in an interview at her Chicago office. ''We stopped telling you things that were particularly important and started just telling you anything that we thought maybe offered you a little bit of eye candy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Marin, 51, said she believed that the quality of local news had deteriorated gradually in recent decades. As entertainment programming costs went up, news became a comparatively stronger profit generator for station managers, who with the help of consultants devised stunts and gimmicks to draw viewers.</p>
        <p>One such stunt, in fact, led Ms. Marin to leave her previous job, in 1997, as the lead anchor at WMAQ, Chicago's NBC station. In what she considered a clear ploy to lure viewers, WMAQ hired Jerry Springer, host of the daytime talk show, as an on-air commentator for the newscast she co-anchored. After nearly 20 years at the station, she quit in protest.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marin moved to WBBM, initially as a part-time correspondent focusing on investigative pieces not only for the local news, but also for the CBS network's new prime-time magazine show ''Public Eye with Bryant Gumbel.'' She said at the time that she had sworn off anchoring for good.</p>
        <p>But when the ratings for WBBM's late evening news program slipped even further in May 1999, the station  manager, Hank Price, persuaded  Ms. Marin to take the 10 p.m. anchor slot by promising that she would be able to shape the local program as she saw fit.</p>
        <p>It was an offer she could not refuse. Along with station executives and news department staffers, Ms. Marin set about devising a wholly new 10 p.m. broadcast. She convened  dozens of meetings over six months in which they debated how news should be defined and how it should be conveyed to viewers. The meetings became almost like group therapy sessions, according to station staff members.</p>
        <p>In the end, the group concluded  that the conventional local news format long used for Channel 2's late evening newscast was unacceptable.</p>
        <p>So they decided that the revised 10 o'clock news would not follow any rigid formula.</p>
        <p>''There were questions that we asked like, 'What do viewers want from weather?' '' said Pat Costello, the new WBBM news director. ''If there's the threat of a big storm, they want to know everything. Otherwise, they want to know 'How hot? How cold?' and 'What's it going to be like for the next five days?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baskerville, the weatherman, was told to shorten his reports, although he was assured they would grow in length and prominence in cases of severe weather. Tim Weigel, the sportscaster, was given similar orders.</p>
        <p>Another philosophical question arose: if an abandoned warehouse is burning brightly near the highway, making for great photography, but no one is hurt and traffic has not been affected, is it a story? Maybe, Ms. Marin said. But, she added, ''You don't stick a reporter out there in front of it, eight hours later, and say, 'There was an unbelievable fire here earlier today where nobody got hurt and nothing was lost.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Breen, the health reporter, and staff members agreed that the nightly health reports were among the worst offenders.</p>
        <p>''We'd say, 'Coming up: The fruit that kills you,' '' Dr. Breen recalled. ''And, it would be, 'grapefruit -- if you combine it with certain medications.' '' The solution, they agreed, was for Dr. Breen to present reports less frequently but on weightier issues.</p>
        <p>The team also decided the station would produce longer stories and pass over those considered inconsequential. And any banter between personalities that was not spontaneous was out, as were plugs for sponsors or network shows.</p>
        <p>''Among the things that I said I couldn't ever do again,'' Ms. Marin said, ''is to say 'Meet the real guy behind tonight's movie.' ''</p>
        <p>And, finally, there would be no closing shots of animals -- or, as the staff mantra had it, ''no water-skiing squirrels.''</p>
        <p>On a paper, at least, it was a completely new format for television news. And Mr. Price signed off on the plan. With CBS so far back in third place, there was nothing to lose. And here was a program he could sell to advertisers as being geared to a more upscale, sophisticated crowd. The sales staff did just that, executives said, lifting the rate for a 30-second spot nearly 20 percent.</p>
        <p>When the revamped format was introduced on Feb. 7, Ms. Marin, as a lone female anchor, stood in marked contrast to the rival network affiliates' male-female anchor teams.  Her competitors led their newscasts with stories about a water main break earlier that day in downtown Chicago. Ms. Marin's newscast all but ignored it.</p>
        <p>Instead, she opened with a report about the deposed city treasurer, Miriam Santons, who had spoken that day with reporters for the first time since a judge had reversed her conviction on charges of fraud and attempted extortion.</p>
        <p>For the first month, viewer reaction was positive. According to Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings service, the program was watched in 214,700 homes in February, a sweeps month in which stations closely gauge ratings to set advertising rates. But while the audience was 5 percent larger than it had been a year earlier, viewership was still far smaller than for the 10 p.m. news programs on ABC (474,295 households) and NBC (349,563).</p>
        <p>Yet, while there was a falloff among older viewers of Ms. Marin's program, its audience of people between 25 and 54 -- who matter most to the advertisers that sponsor news -- increased 33 percent over the year-earlier period. And viewership among more affluent viewers was also up for February.</p>
        <p>The ratings upturn seemed to be temporary, however. During the  May sweeps period, the program's viewership declined 13 percent in total households, compared with the prior May, and was down by 25 percent among viewers in the 25-to-54 age range, according to Nielsen.</p>
        <p>The WBBM approach has come under fire from some media critics and, not surprisingly, from competitors, who have taken to calling it ''PBS on CBS.'' One of the newscast's more prominent critics is Bill Kurtis, a former WBBM anchor who is now host of ''Investigative Reports'' on the A&amp;E cable network.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Kurtis criticized the program for failing to report all of the news of the day. ''I think they made a mistake,'' he said. ''You have to cover the news or you're a talk show.''</p>
        <p>At WBBM, Mr. Price said he intended to stay with the format adopted for Ms. Marin's 10 p.m. program, which, he said, still needed time to catch on with viewers.</p>
        <p>And it seems the people who matter, the people who buy ads, are willing to stick with him.</p>
        <p>''I'm really holding out,'' said Ross S. Currie, local broadcast director of the Chicago branch of TN Media, a media buying firm. ''I really think BBM will come around.''</p>
        <p>Besides, Mr. Currie said he expected the ratings to go up soon, with some help from CBS's new hit program in prime time: ''Survivor.''</p>
