        <p>It was early in the fortnight, and Richard Williams was crisscrossing the grounds with a cigarette dangling from his lips, shaking random thoughts from his head like Tic-Tacs. Did he mention his screenplay, his plans for a magazine, his interests in cashing in on the Internet?</p>
        <p>''I'm into Webcasting,'' Williams said. ''If Serena and Venus went into that business, they'd make more money in two years than they would in 50 of doing something else. If it was up to me, I'd like to see them retire right now and move on. Let's go.''</p>

        <p>It was early in the fortnight, and Richard Williams was crisscrossing the grounds with a cigarette dangling from his lips, shaking random thoughts from his head like Tic-Tacs. Did he mention his screenplay, his plans for a magazine, his interests in cashing in on the Internet?</p>
        <p>''I'm into Webcasting,'' Williams said. ''If Serena and Venus went into that business, they'd make more money in two years than they would in 50 of doing something else. If it was up to me, I'd like to see them retire right now and move on. Let's go.''</p>
        <p>It's just a suggestion, though. At the same time that Tour parents like Damir Dokic and Samantha Stevenson appeared on the grounds of the All England Club like Svengalis for their children -- either feeding them answers to questions or hovering over their every move during the first week of Wimbledon -- it became more apparent that Richard and Oracene Williams have raised two independent thinkers.</p>
        <p>They still call Richard Williams Daddy, but as Serena and Venus Williams exit their teens one by one, both have been encouraged to inch into adulthood. With built-in filters for parental advice, they have begun to make their own decisions.</p>
        <p>''It depends on what decision it is,'' said Venus Williams, who turned 20 two weeks ago. ''My parents have taught us to make decisions on our own, to be independent. But on certain things, we still go, 'Can we do this?' It's quite odd.''</p>
        <p>But normal, too. Sometimes, normal seems in short supply on the Tour. So does perspective, and this is a trait Venus and Serena Williams use deftly when it comes to their father's techno-career dreams for them.</p>
        <p>''When you're real good at something, it's tough to say goodbye, especially if it's something you've done all your life,'' said Venus Williams, who, like Serena, will begin Week 2 of Wimbledon with a Round of 16 match today. ''I suppose I'll be around a little while more. No more retirement scares at this point.</p>
        <p>''I'd get bored in an office, just sitting around, eating doughnuts.''</p>
        <p>She knows herself well. Early last week her father told a story about how Venus used to stare out the window of her second-grade classroom, with the sound of the lecture as background noise for her daydreams.</p>
        <p>''The teacher said to me, 'Your daughter has no interest in school; she's always looking out the window,' '' Richard Williams said. ''I thought she was kidding, but I got up on top of the building and saw her looking out the window. I asked Venus why, and she said, 'Everything they're doing, I did in first grade.' ''</p>
        <p>On a tour where education is sometimes squeezed in between photo ops, practice time, travel schedules and matches, the articulate Williams sisters do seem advanced. They enjoy the learning process -- even on the court. They have heard past criticisms about their games -- too much power, not enough strategy -- and have been open to change.</p>
        <p>''We have a different game than when we first came out,'' said Serena Williams, who will be 19 in September. ''We have a lot of power, whereas someone who doesn't have it has to do different things. But I think now I have added strategy to my game.''</p>
        <p>They have not altered their flair, though. They are still as free spirited and shoulder high in self-esteem as when they arrived on the scene, but they were a calm core amid the lunacy that whirled around them last week. On the same day Jelena Dokic's ranting father was led away by the police, an accusation of a racial slur was leveled by Alexandra Stevenson, and Alexandra's mother, Samantha, described a physical confrontation with a French player, the Williams sisters would not be baited into the fray.</p>
        <p>In the past, Serena Williams has denied any encounters of overt racism on the Tour, but she was politically aware enough to take a stand against the Confederate flag in South Carolina, refusing to play in the state. On Friday night, a day after Alexandra Stevenson's claim, Serena Williams was asked again if she had been confronted with racism.</p>
        <p>''I've already covered that question,'' she said. ''You can get the transcripts.''</p>
        <p>The sisters are quick witted, sometimes coy, but often viewed as aloof. Yet their standoffishness seems born out of a survival instinct. Last week, Stevenson described hazing she said she received from fellow players she believed were jealous of her celebrity. While the Williams sisters have been celebrated on magazine covers and in television features, they do not take notes on who loves or loathes them. Steering clear of gossip, they keep their distance from other players.</p>
        <p>''I'm always around my mom, my dad and Venus,'' Serena Williams said. ''Just stick close to yourself and be not too friendly. That's why a lot of people have a problem with us, because we're not too friendly with anyone. We're cordial, say, 'Hi,' and et cetera.''</p>
        <p>They are not motivated by popularity, steered by cliques or unnerved by sister envy. When Week 2 of Wimbledon begins, Venus and Serena Williams will be on track to accomplish the same thing: win at Wimbledon. Last summer, Serena won the United States Open title while Venus sat emotionally detached from the moment. At that point, the issue of sibling rivalry took root. On Saturday, Venus Williams handled the issue the same way she does most others, with maturity.</p>
        <p>''I don't even think we have sibling rivalry in our heart,'' she said. ''Whatever we share, we share the best we can. I don't think it's inside of us. Does it really matter who won a Grand Slam first? She played better. It's my loss. It's her win. It's all in the Williams family.''</p>
        <p>It is a family that is tight, and yet Richard and Oracene Williams have given their daughters room to grow. Their daughters recently moved into their own home. And during a week when parents trampled the bounds of control, the sisters stood out as glowing examples of independence.</p>
        <p>''My dad always talks about his mom,'' said Serena Williams, whose grandmother was a sharecropper. ''He always talks about how she helped him be the person that he is. He's a very positive person. He's really outgoing and really he's like -- I wish I could describe him. He's very determined. I just imagine my grandmother to be the same way.</p>
        <p>''I never really got a chance to know her very well, but from all the stuff that he says and the things that he does, usually the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.''</p>
