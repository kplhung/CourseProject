        <p>Two more suspects were arrested last evening in connection with the recent Central Park attacks against women, bringing the total number charged to 28, the police said.</p>
        <p>One of the men, Andy Alvarez, 35, of 60 Pitt Street in Manhattan, was picked out of the crowd at an Orchard Beach concert yesterday by another audience member, a 19-year-old woman. She told a police officer that Mr. Alvarez had assaulted her after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11. Mr. Alvarez was charged with sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>The woman, who had not previously reported the attack to police, was the 59th victim to come forward, said  Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The second man, Cyheme Saunders, 22, of 219 Lawrence Avenue in Inwood, Nassau County, was identified on home videos taken of the melee, during which dozens of women were undressed and assaulted. He was charged with rioting and sexual abuse. He was arrested by a police task force.</p>
        <p>The Police Department, which has faced strong criticism that it failed to respond to reports of violence after the parade, plans to release the findings of its internal investigation today.</p>
