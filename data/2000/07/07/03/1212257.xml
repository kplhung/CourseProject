        <p>WHEN the online privacy debate reached its peak earlier this year, the watchwords were ''notice'' and ''choice.'' Consumer groups demanded that online advertising companies like DoubleClick give consumers more notice when tracking their behavior, and give them the choice to avoid such tracking.</p>
        <p>But there are two other core privacy principles: giving consumers ''access'' to data collected on them and providing them with the ''security'' that the data is kept private.</p>
        <p>The first two terms continue to be volleyed back-and-forth by legislators scoring points in this year's campaign, but the latter two have received scant air time.</p>
        <p>That may change, as companies have begun heeding the call of privacy advocates to increase access to profiling data.</p>
        <p>The only problem is, the techniques of the companies that offer solutions on data access may actually run afoul of some privacy groups. The resulting conflict could shift the debate to a new front and make strange bedfellows of privacy advocates and the advertising networks and other companies that have until now been their prime targets.</p>
        <p>Access has been a sleeper issue primarily because it is so complex. It seems obvious that consumers should be able to check the files that others keep on them and to change anything that is wrong. But articulating the boundaries of such a policy is no easy task.</p>
        <p>Should businesses give consumers access to transactions made years ago, data that the company has on a computer tape sitting in the back of a storage closet? Should they be forced to spend millions of dollars updating their computer systems so consumers can see and change that information? And what right do consumers have to data that is collected not about them, per se, but on the computers they share with others at work or at home?</p>
        <p>These questions have led advertising networks like DoubleClick and Engage, among others, which gather information on users anonymously, to hold off on giving users access to data.</p>
        <p>Still, recent steps within the industry suggest that some companies are heeding the call for access.</p>
        <p>One such company is BeFree, which, among other things, distributes software that helps online businesses tailor their content to the user's interest. This so-called personalization software has become increasingly common among e-commerce companies this year, as they vie to improve their profit margins by showing customers merchandise they are more likely to buy.</p>
        <p>This software also raises privacy issues, as it relies on tracking a user's behavior on a site, or a group of sites, to determine a consumer's buying preferences. As with other companies that track user activities, BeFree inserts a ''cookie,'' or a number within a small text file, on the user's hard drive, to track activity.</p>
        <p>BeFree says it requires the sites that use the software to inform customers how it works, and give them a way to opt out of the tracking. The company also goes one step further, by giving users access to the information gathered on them.</p>
        <p>For instance, on SuperGo.com, a bicycle store, users can click on a link within the site's privacy statement and go to another site set up by BeFree, which then discloses information compiled about the user's behavior on SuperGo. Later this year, when BeFree tracks user activity across multiple sites, it will disclose the user's information from all the sites on one page.</p>
        <p>To authenticate the identity of the user who asks for his online dossier, BeFree checks the user's cookie number, then retrieves only the browsing and purchasing information associated with that cookie.</p>
        <p>Notably, BeFree does not have full control over how that information is displayed. At the moment, for example, SuperGo customers can view only the stock numbers of the products they looked at or purchased. Steven Laff, who designed the SuperGo site, said the company would translate those numbers to text soon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laff said that giving consumers access to data gathered on them was a common sense approach. ''It's a nice, respectful thing to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Executives of other companies facing the same access questions said the BeFree approach was flawed. Daniel J. Jaye, co-founder of Engage, an online advertising company that tracks consumers anonymously, said BeFree ''may be well-intentioned, but it could lead to a security breach.'' Mr. Jaye said the technique jeopardized users' privacy, because it could disclose their information to someone else who uses the same computer.</p>
        <p>For example, if a person visited the SuperGo site while at work, an employer or a co-worker could sit at the same computer and see that a person used it to shop for bikes, or easily view that person's BeFree profile.</p>
        <p>Andrew Shen, policy analyst for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, and a  critic of companies like Engage that track online users, said: ''I actually agree with Dan on this one. You don't want that information to end up in the wrong hands.''</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Gerace, BeFree's co-founder, said he considered that argument when developing the software, but added that when two or more people used the same computer, Web browser software allowed users to control their information by erasing cookies.</p>
        <p>''The user just has to be conscious about how they're using the machine,'' Mr. Gerace said.</p>
        <p>Analysts say the access issue is less problematic when companies gather information, usually offline, that includes a person's identity.</p>
        <p>Unlike companies that only track users online anonymously -- and therefore have no way to ensure that they are disclosing profile information to the right person -- companies that track personally identifiable information have alternatives. Because these businesses usually have an address to go along with a name, they can simply send a letter with the information requested, or send a log-in and password so the consumer can view the information online.</p>
        <p>The Axciom Corporation, which sells information on tens of millions of United States households, allows users to get access to their information by sending a letter and $5 to the company. More important, Axciom released technology last year that allows companies with vast amounts of consumer data to sift through it quickly and present it for review or editing by consumers or a sales staff.</p>
        <p>The technology, dubbed AbiliTec, solves one aspect of the access issue for companies that collect data on consumers from several sources -- for instance, through mail order operations, retail stores or the Web.</p>
        <p>Such companies often contend that it would be too burdensome to offer consumers access to personal data, because it would be technologically impossible to compile that data in one place quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <p>AbiliTec and competing products may make it easier for companies to do that, but such technology is not inexpensive. One Axciom executive said it could cost a large retailer that sells through a traditional store, a catalog and the Web more than a million dollars to implement.</p>
        <p>Other solutions to the access problem are coming to market, as well. ECustomers.com, for instance, has developed technology that will soon allow e-tailers to use data about a person's offline shopping habits to  tailor their display of merchandise for consumers who sign up for the ECustomers service. Like BeFree, ECustomers plans to allow consumers to have access to the data it compiles on them, by mailing a log-in number and password. If the consumer's address matches the one ECustomers has on file, the consumer's identity is all but assured.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, for companies that continue to collect data anonymously to preserve users' privacy -- but who do not want to follow BeFree's example -- there are few, if any, technological solutions to the access problem.</p>
        <p>''We very much support the notion of access,'' said Mr. Jaye of Engage, which places ads on Web sites based on a user's online activity. ''But we can't do it securely. It's kind of a devil-if-you-do, devil-if-you-don't situation.''</p>
