        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The CBS series ''Survivor'' is pulling monster ratings for glorifying a form of lifeboat triage and survival of the fittest, throwing one member over the side, figuratively, each week (Business Day, June 26).</p>
        <p>But what's wrong with this picture: Why is cutthroat eviction a feature of ''Survivor''?</p>
        <p>As entertainment it's a downer, unless you find ''Lord of the Flies'' fun. Why can't all the members of each tribe survive and stay on the island? That achievement would take even more superior team talents than merely tossing people overboard, would it not?</p>
        <p>Surely this is a model for our society that needs promoting. Selecting champion survivors each week and celebrating them in interviews on ''The Early Show'' would increase ratings even further. Besides, who wants to watch interviews with evicted losers?</p>
