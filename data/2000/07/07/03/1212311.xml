        <p>Notah Begay III accomplished something today that not even his former Stanford teammate Tiger Woods has done this year on the PGA Tour.

Woods has won five over all and two consecutive starts, but none in back-to-back weeks.</p>

        <p>Notah Begay III accomplished something today that not even his former Stanford teammate Tiger Woods has done this year on the PGA Tour. With a dramatic 23-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole, Begay won the Greater Hartford Open to become the first player to win tournaments in consecutive weeks this year. Woods has won five over all and two consecutive starts, but none in back-to-back weeks.</p>
        <p>It was Begay's fourth victory in less than two years on the PGA Tour and followed another one-stroke triumph a week ago at the St. Jude Classic in Memphis.</p>
        <p>It was only appropriate that Begay, 27, whose four-under-par 64 today gave him a 20-under-par 260 over all, a record for the Tournament Players' Club at River Highlands course, would close out his victory with a dazzling putt after Mark Calcavecchia had left his 25-foot birdie attempt short by a foot. Begay's putter had been a wondrous club throughout his round today as he drained birdie putts from 10 feet to his 23-footer.</p>
        <p>''It's been the highest of the high,  and the lowest of the low,'' said Begay, the only American Indian on the PGA Tour. ''To win two tournaments in my first year on the tour last year and now two this year -- that's been the high. The lowest of the low was the D.U.I. arrest and the week in jail.''</p>
        <p>That was a reference to Begay's arrest in his hometown of Albuquerque in January and a subsequent seven-day jail sentence on a drunken-driving charge.</p>
        <p>''It's been an uphill battle, and it's made me play with a lot of spirit,'' Begay said.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old Calcavecchia, the winner of nine PGA Tour events and five international tournaments, including the 1989 British Open, finished at 68. He had entered the final round three strokes ahead of Begay, but Begay drew even with his fourth birdie at No. 7. Calcavecchia then fell behind by two strokes when he missed a 4-foot putt at No. 11 for a bogey and Begay knocked down a 20-foot birdie putt at No. 12.</p>
        <p>But Calcavecchia, playing with Begay, made up those two shots when he eagled the 296-yard par-4 15th hole, on which he drove with a 3-wood and then putted 4 feet for the eagle. That put both players even at 19 under par.</p>
        <p>After parring the 17th hole, both Begay and Calcavecchia pulled their tee shots into a fairway bunker 171 feet from the 18th green. But both recovered by drilling 7-irons to the green. Calcavecchia then lagged his 25-foot putt short. Begay, putting right-handed -- he is the only player on the PGA Tour who putts from both sides, depending on the lie -- then rolled in his 23-footer for his sixth birdie of the day and for a victory worth $504,000. He had earned $540,000 for his triumph in Memphis a week ago.</p>
        <p>''I was in complete control today, and I played a very well-rounded professional golf round,'' he said. ''And that last putt was perfect -- it had perfect speed.''</p>
        <p>Not to mention perfect direction.</p>
        <p>Calcavecchia, who has not won since 1998, said he was disappointed. ''But I don't feel I lost the tournament; he won it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kirk Triplett, who fired a course-record 61 Saturday, shot a 67 to finish in third at 264.</p>
        <p>When Begay was asked if he would go for a third straight victory next week in the Western Open -- something that has not been done since Woods won three successive events last November -- he said, ''No, I'm going to Wimbledon to watch some guys play on the grass.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''But we've got to keep the Stanford streak going. Woods won the U.S. Open, and now I've won the last two weeks, so he's got to win next week.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>CHARLES HOWELL, who while a junior at Oklahoma State in June won the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship with a record 23 under par, carded a final-round 68 to finish at six-under-par 274 in his first tournament as a professional.</p>
