        <p>During a long winter, there were moments when Patrick Rafter's surgically repaired shoulder deceived him. After arthroscopic surgery in October to repair a tear in his rotator cuff, he went through a series of optimistic strides that were routinely dashed by a setback.</p>
        <p>He was not sure, but perhaps the tennis career was over for Rafter, the two-time United States Open winner with the screaming-teenager following. Rafter thought that if this season was too much of a struggle, he might retire. But after all the rehabilitation, and all the time he was forced to confront his tennis mortality, Rafter has snapped back to life. When play resumes on Monday at Wimbledon, the 12th-seeded Rafter will face Thomas Johansson in the Round of 16.</p>

        <p>During a long winter, there were moments when Patrick Rafter's surgically repaired shoulder deceived him. After arthroscopic surgery in October to repair a tear in his rotator cuff, he went through a series of optimistic strides that were routinely dashed by a setback.</p>
        <p>He was not sure, but perhaps the tennis career was over for Rafter, the two-time United States Open winner with the screaming-teenager following. Rafter thought that if this season was too much of a struggle, he might retire. But after all the rehabilitation, and all the time he was forced to confront his tennis mortality, Rafter has snapped back to life. When play resumes on Monday at Wimbledon, the 12th-seeded Rafter will face Thomas Johansson in the Round of 16.</p>
        <p>''I realize I have a chance here again,'' Rafter said. ''Now, I'm starting to play good tennis again. The shoulder's fine. Makes me excited to be out here. I still haven't had a big five-setter, yet. Not that I want one, but it still really hasn't been tested out. But I'm confident it will be fine.''</p>
        <p>He was not so sure after his surgery. Just over a year ago, Rafter began to feel the pain creep into his shoulder during the French Open. It worsened at Wimbledon as he advanced to the semifinals. By the United States Open, it was unbearable, and he withdrew in the fifth set of his first-round match.</p>
        <p>''I'm just pretty happy out here doing what I'm doing and trying to enjoy the most of it right now,'' the 27-year old Rafter said. ''There's no guarantee the shoulder will be ready or fit in three years, so I'm doing everything I can, all the strength work. I'm at the gym all the time. I have a lot of other little exercises I have to do every day. If I can continue that, then hopefully I can get through another couple years.''</p>
        <p>Bouncing Back</p>
        <p>In one of the intriguing matches on Monday, the resilient Jennifer Capriati will play second-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the Round of 16. They are just two of the Americans who have survived the women's draw.</p>
        <p>After failing to fare well at the French Open, the American women are dominating Wimbledon. The list also includes Venus and Serena Williams, Monica Seles, Lisa Raymond, Kristina Brandi and Lilia Osterloh.</p>
        <p>''It's been really great,'' Davenport said. ''There is always a level of players, it seems, that always get forgotten because they're not at the top, like Osterloh, Brandi and even Raymond to a certain point. So it's been a very good tournament.''</p>
        <p>Just Like Old Times</p>
        <p>On the day of rest at Wimbledon, John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg stirred up echoes from the past when they played in a charity event today. In 1980, Borg defeated McEnroe for the Wimbledon title in five sets after an epic fourth-set tie breaker. Today, McEnroe used his deft touch to come away with a 6-3, 7-6 (5) victory. Typical McEnroe, he yelled out, ''You can't be serious,'' when the referee delayed suspending the match because of a 15-minute drizzle.</p>
