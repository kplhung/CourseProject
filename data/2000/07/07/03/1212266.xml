        <p>Most telecommunications experts may see the $115 billion WorldCom-Sprint merger as having one foot in the grave, but the companies are not yet ready to declare it dead. At least not yet.</p>
        <p>Some people at both WorldCom Inc. and the Sprint Corporation contend that the deal can be salvaged, despite opposition from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''I can say that it is not 100 percent locked and clearly over,'' one person close to the companies said over the weekend. ''Over the next few days it will become more clear.''</p>
        <p>Officials from both companies have declined to comment, while they weigh their options. Reached over the weekend, John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's vice chairman, would say only: ''I believe the company will be successful with or without Sprint. We have more options than people think.''</p>
        <p>One big impetus for keeping the merger on life support may be the desire of Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's 58-year-old chief executive, to make the merger the capstone achievement of the acquisition strategy he has used for nearly two decades to build WorldCom into an international power. Otherwise, Mr. Ebbers would be left to contemplate how the deal's rejection by antitrust officials in Washington and Brussels was the result of the very modus operandi that brought him so close to the pinnacle.</p>
        <p>But the die-hards may be unable to prevail, at least partly because hard-liners at the two companies differ sharply on just how they would handle the regulatory challenges.</p>
        <p>After the European Commission's top antitrust official said last Monday he opposed the deal on grounds that it would give WorldCom too much control of Internet traffic, the companies withdrew the merger proposal in Europe -- though reserving the option to reintroduce it in the future. Last Tuesday, the United States Justice Department filed a suit to block the merger, saying it would place too much of the nation's long-distance market in WorldCom's hands.</p>
        <p>The Sprint hold-outs are inclined to try fighting the Justice Department in court, according to people close to the companies. But WorldCom, contending that a court battle would take too long to be effective no matter the outcome, is said to be willing to accede to the Justice Department's demand -- that it sell Sprint's long-distance and local phone operations, as well as Sprint's Internet business. That would still give WorldCom what it wants most: Sprint's extensive wireless network.</p>
        <p>But Sprint opposes such a drastic dismembering, which is why many analysts predict that it may end up seeking a merger partner that would keep the company largely intact. ''I think they'll be speaking German soon,'' said Eric Strumingher, a communications analyst at PaineWebber.  He was referring to the German communications giant Deutsche Telekom's well-known interest in Sprint.</p>
        <p>In any event, WorldCom would have trouble promising regulators that it would dismantle Sprint until it knew how much money the various units would fetch. And under its deal with Sprint, WorldCom is constrained from talking to outside companies about splitting Sprint into pieces.</p>
        <p>People close to Mr. Ebbers have said in recent days that if the Sprint deal had gone smoothly, he might have considered it his swan song, the final act of a spectacular career that would have let him leave the stage on his own terms. But besides being a communications titan, Mr. Ebbers is also known as a combative, ornery man -- an executive who would almost certainly not want to go out on a busted Sprint deal.</p>
        <p>''Look, if we had closed the deal and everything had worked out perfectly and the stock was at 90 or 100 then maybe he would leave,'' one person close to WorldCom said over the weekend. ''But he wouldn't want to go out without things being tied up.</p>
        <p>If there is one thing Mr. Ebbers has always cared about, it is his company's stock price. After rising robustly for most of the 1990's, WorldCom's stock has languished since last year, closing Friday at $45.875, up $1.8125.</p>
        <p>So analysts and people close to the company said Mr. Ebbers was quite likely to take a dramatic step to raise his company's share price, whether or not the Sprint deal was saved. The most likely move, according to people close to the company, would be a sale of most or all of WorldCom's consumer long-distance business, second in the nation only to AT&amp;T's.</p>
        <p>''I think Bernie does one thing for sure, which is show Wall Street that he's really working for the shareholder,'' said Mr. Strumingher, the analyst. ''It's been now almost a year where his stock has underperformed dramatically.''</p>
        <p>Before acquiring MCI in 1998, WorldCom was hardly in the consumer business at all. And these days, the consumer long-distance industry, with its incessant price wars, is often less profitable than serving business customers.</p>
        <p>Because consumers, unlike business customers, do not sign long-term contracts, the consumer side of the industry can also be far more volatile. That is why many institutional money managers are currently wary of investing in companies that have a big presence in the consumer long-distance business -- a wariness that has also deflated AT&amp;T's stock.</p>
        <p>So by spinning off all or part of its consumer long-distance business, WorldCom could boost its growth and, at least as important, increase the stability and predictability of its financial results. Of course, regulatory constraints might limit the pool of potential buyers, since neither AT&amp;T or any of the Bell companies would be likely to receive approval to buy WorldCom's consumer long-distance business even if they wanted to.</p>
        <p>That leaves at least two likely options for dispatching the consumer business, according to analysts and people close to WorldCom. The first is a complete sale of the consumer subscribers to a financial buyer like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, Forstmann Little &amp; Company or Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst Inc. WorldCom would become a wholesale supplier to that unit, providing the network operation but shedding the marketing costs. One of the buyout companies could would enjoy billions of dollars in cash flow from the unit; and as a private company it could ignore the stock market's distaste for the consumer long-distance business.</p>
        <p>Another, even more intriguing possibility, would be a sale of a big stake in the consumer long-distance business to a consumer-oriented company that could market the service more efficiently than WorldCom does now. One person close to WorldCom mentioned, ''people like Disney, Microsoft or AOL'' as potential partners. On condition of anonymity, the same person estimated that the chance of WorldCom's announcing some sort of consumer long-distance spin-off in the next six months or so at between 50 and 80 percent, no matter the fate of the Sprint deal.</p>
        <p>Even if such a spin-off becomes the consolation prize of an aborted Sprint merger, Mr. Ebbers would still have to make peace with the realization that his hard-bargain approach to the communications industry might have finally caught up with him.</p>
        <p>A big reason that the Justice Department has balked at the WorldCom-Sprint deal is because Mr. Ebbers left a bad taste in regulators' mouths the last time they approved one of his big deals -- the acquisition of MCI two years ago. In that case, Mr. Ebbers agreed to sell MCI's Internet business to Cable and Wireless P.L.C.</p>
        <p>But afterward, Cable &amp; Wireless contended that WorldCom did not transfer all of the customers and assets that their deal specified. At least as important, in the United States, Cable and Wireless was also left in the position of buying capacity on WorldCom's fiber-optic network to connect the MCI Internet switches. That made it very difficult for Cable and Wireless to make money on the MCI Internet operation.</p>
        <p>For WorldCom, driving a bargain so hard that it almost looked unfair was just business as usual. It was the style that had made WorldCom and it was why investors have generally loved Mr. Ebbers.</p>
        <p>But the regulators were not favorably impressed. And so Mr. Ebbers had no good will waiting for him when his lawyers went back to the same regulatory agencies last fall seeking approval for the Sprint deal.</p>
        <p>''It's live by the sword, die by the sword,'' Mr. Strumingher said. ''WorldCom has a take-no-prisoners approach, which has rewarded shareholders handsomely over the years. But that approach is not without risks.''</p>
