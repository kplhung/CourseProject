        <p>MANHATTAN: HOTEL BOUGHT  Leonard Litwin, a developer whose company owns 18 apartment towers on the East Side, recently bought his first hotel, the Sutton. Mr. Litwin paid about $35 million for the Sutton, an extended-stay hotel with 84 suites on East 56th Street, near First Avenue. Built in 1928, the hotel fell on hard times after World War II. In 1991, Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd. bought the property for $7.2 million.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GUN ACCIDENT  A 27-year-old man was hospitalized in stable condition last night after he accidentally shot himself with a gun he had picked up after another man used it to shoot into a car in the Times Square area, the police said. The incident began at 4:20 a.m. yesterday when Stephen Jackson, 25, of 51-52 71st Street in Woodside, Queens, fired two shots into a car occupied by three people outside the China Club, the police said. Mr. Jackson dropped the gun and fled on 47th Street, where he was arrested, the police said. Another man, Jacob Snyder, picked up the gun but was soon stopped, and as he was handing it over, he shot himself in the lower back, the police said. Both men were charged with criminal possession of a weapon, and Mr. Jackson was also charged with reckless endangerment.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: POWER PLANT STALLED  Citing high costs and community opposition, Consolidated Edison and KeySpan Energy said Thursday that they would suspend a plan to build a 500-megawatt power plant on the Brooklyn waterfront at the Greenpoint Terminal Market. The 14-acre property, a former manufacturing site, became a rallying point for residents and elected officials, who cited environmental problems.</p>

        <p>WHITEHALL: BOX OF BONES  Forensics specialists for the state police will examine bones found in a 5-foot-long box that had been hidden in a building in Whitehall, 65 miles north of Albany. The 133-year-old building was the meeting place of a chapter of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, a fraternal organization, until the 1960's. Workers renovating the building found the box of bones, topped with a metal plaque that read ''Brother,'' under a trap door in the meeting room, where the floor had been framed to fit the box. The state police want to determine if the bones -- a skull, ribs, and arm and leg bones -- were placed there after someone was killed.</p>

        <p>DELAWARE COUNTY: EAGLE COMEBACK  Officials expect this to be a record year in New York for eagle nesting as a result of the birds' comeback from near extinction. But wildlife officials warn spectators not to approach the birds. ''A lot of people are gawking and walking up to eagle nests, which endangers the eaglets,'' said Scott Van Arsdale, a State Department of Environmental Conservation wildlife biologist. Residents in two villages have contacted Mr. Van Arsdale about people disturbing nesting eagles.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: PLEA IN ABUSE CASE  A New Haven woman charged with murder in the 1998 beating death of her 6-year-old nephew pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on Thursday. The woman, Lynne Friend, is to be sentenced Sept. 8 and faces up to 30 years in prison. A state panel found that officials had known that David Ryan Keeley, the nephew, might have been at risk from Ms. Friend but had not intervened.</p>
