        <p>CNN plans to announce today that it has struck a deal with Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, NTT DoCoMo, to provide news and other information to customers over their mobile telephone handsets.</p>
        <p>The service will provide breaking news in English or Japanese to subscribers of DoCoMo's i-mode service, a wildly popular service in Japan that allows customers to surf customized Web sites over the Internet. I-mode became so popular in Japan that DoCoMo recently had to limit sales of cellular phone handsets that offer Internet access to ease the load on its overburdened network.</p>

        <p>CNN plans to announce today that it has struck a deal with Japan's largest mobile telephone operator, NTT DoCoMo, to provide news and other information to customers over their mobile telephone handsets.</p>
        <p>The service will provide breaking news in English or Japanese to subscribers of DoCoMo's i-mode service, a wildly popular service in Japan that allows customers to surf customized Web sites over the Internet. I-mode became so popular in Japan that DoCoMo recently had to limit sales of cellular phone handsets that offer Internet access to ease the load on its overburdened network.</p>
        <p>While most Web sites on the Internet have had a hard time charging consumers for access to content, CNN, a unit of Time Warner, predicts customers will be willing to pay for content over their mobile telephones. While news headlines will be free, users will be charged 300 yen, or $2.83, to download an entire article. The charges will be added to customers' monthly telephone bills.</p>
        <p>The service is being offered through CNN Mobile, a CNN unit that has formed similar alliances with other mobile telephone operators internationally. The information  delivered over the service comes mostly from CNN's Web site, CNN.com.</p>
        <p>The CNN/i-mode service could serve as a model of sorts for other mobile Internet access services, because of DoCoMo's network, which can deliver data at much higher speeds than most other current mobile telephone networks.</p>
        <p>The service will be promoted through CNN Interactive and CNN International and could eventually be marketed through America Online, if AOL's acquisition of Time Warner is completed.</p>
