        <p>The tale begins in the middle of a swelteringly hot April night in 1996 on a train meandering through the Indian countryside. Pankaj Mishra, a 27-year-old editor at HarperCollins's India division, was reading a manuscript, a first novel by a relatively unknown Indian film writer.</p>
        <p>The writer was Arundhati Roy. The novel was ''The God of Small Things,'' a story of love and caste in Kerala in tropical southwest India. Mr. Mishra immediately championed her book in the West and watched his instincts validated as it sold nearly three million copies worldwide and won the prestigious Booker Prize in Britain.</p>
        <p>Now, four years later, a young, critically praised generation of Indian writers -- some of whom are now New Yorkers -- are following in Ms. Roy's footsteps in their chosen language, English.</p>
        <p>And although their voices are being heard much more loudly in the West than in India, they are ushering in a new era for Indian literature in English. They are often called Midnight's Grandchildren in homage to another seminal Indian novel, Salman Rushdie's ''Midnight's Children,'' the dark parable of Indian history since independence that won the Booker Prize in 1981 and in 1993 won a special Booker Prize as the best British novel of the previous quarter century. Now the new generation of writers have in many ways broken away from the magic realism that characterizes much of Mr. Rushdie's work.</p>
        <p>''The signal that young Indian writers got from the success of 'The God of Small Things' and the way the media dealt with the book is that there are people out there willing to look at what you have to say,'' said Raj Kamal Jha, a 33-year-old editor at The Indian Express in New Delhi, whose first novel, ''The Blue Bedspread,'' has received strong reviews and an advance reported in the Indian press to be more than $275,000.</p>
        <p>The phenomenon, publishers and writers say, is also a product of a renewed interest in things Indian that began in 1997 with the mammoth publicity for the 50th anniversary of the country's independence and that has been enhanced by the growth of computers and the Internet, which have increased contact between Indian writers and Western influences.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Jha, the writers include Mr. Mishra, now 31, whose first novel, ''The Romantics,'' was called ''resonant and highly subtle'' by Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times; Amit Chaudhuri, 37, of Calcutta whose writing has been described by Mr. Rushdie as ''languorous, elliptical, beautiful''; and Kiran Desai (daughter of the renowned Indian fiction writer Anita Desai), 28, who won praise two years ago for her first novel, ''Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard.''</p>
        <p>They also include Jhumpa Lahiri, a 33-year-old New Yorker, the daughter of Bengali immigrants, who won the Pulitzer Prize in April for her first book, a collection of short stories titled ''Interpreter of Maladies.'' The stories evoke the complex and conflicted world of Indian immigrants in the United States. This month Akhil Sharma, a 28-year-old investment banker in Manhattan whose stories have appeared in The New Yorker and The Atlantic, will publish his first novel, ''An Obedient Father'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux). It is about corruption, decay and greed in the Indian government and about an Indian family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jha, who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi with a degree in mechanical engineering, went on to get a master's degree in journalism at the University of Southern California. Richard Bernstein said in The New York Times that ''The Blue Bedspread,'' published in the United States by Random House, is ''a brilliant beginning for a writer whose voice already shows a maturity well beyond his years.''</p>
        <p>In the novel, an unnamed narrator is told that his sister has died in childbirth and that he must care for her daughter for one night, until the baby can be placed for adoption. As he watches the infant in his home, he writes for her the stories he believes will help her understand her place in the world.</p>
        <p>'' 'The Blue Bedspread' grew out of two things,'' Mr. Jha said. ''One was my emotional, almost physical need to write. When I was young, I had a very severe speech impediment. And when you sit down with pen and paper, you don't visibly stutter. And the other is my feelings about family life in India, what I call the silence of the family. It is very difficult to express feelings, one's true emotions, in an Indian family. My book is about the need to break that silence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jha, like Ms. Roy, was discovered by Mr. Mishra, who has written criticism for The Times Literary Supplement in London and The New York Review of Books and has attracted attention for his criticism of Mr. Rushdie's work.</p>
        <p>''Magic realism was very popular with writers who came immediately after Rushdie,'' he said, ''but the same writers have turned away from it. I think it is because of the inherent unsatisfactoriness of the form, the way in which its formulas further confuse and complicate an already confused and complicated reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushdie, of course, still has many defenders. Michael Wood, a professor of English at Princeton who has written about Mr. Rushdie, said that Mr. Rushdie ''is interested in reimagining reality itself, not in just imagining alternatives to reality.''</p>
        <p>''There is no escape in Rushdie,'' Professor Wood said. ''And confusing and complicating things is quite often a way of understanding them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rushdie, through his agent, declined to comment on the critique.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mishra said that it was notable that Mr. Jha's work broke from the magic realism -- the presentation of magical characters or events in realistic settings -- that pervades much of Mr. Rushdie's work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mishra's writing, in fact, bears a resemblance to Mr. Jha's. The critic Akash Kapur wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''The Romantics'' (also published by Random House) ''establishes Mishra as the author of spare and reflective fiction that is a welcome antidote'' to magic realism. The book is about Samar, a young intellectual who visits Varanasi and the banks of the Ganges and meets a politically active student, a group of bohemian Westerners and a Frenchwoman with whom he has an affair. Samar is both attracted to and mystified by the Westerners -- feelings that Mr. Mishra says mirror in some ways the relationship of Indian writers to the West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jha said that the key fact in talking about Indians who write in English ''is that 95 percent of Indians cannot read and write comfortably in English and have no access to the works.''</p>
        <p>''My mother can't read my book,'' he added. ''And while my book has been bought by several European publishers, no regional-language publisher in my country has bought it.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Lahiri, readership is not a problem. Not quite three months after she won the Pulitzer, 175,000 copies of her book, originally published by Mariner Books/ Houghton Mifflin in paperback, are in print, including 20,000 copies of a new hardcover edition. What is more difficult, the 33-year-old Ms. Lahiri says, is her sense of identity. Ms. Lahiri was born in London and grew up in Rhode Island with her parents, immigrants from Calcutta. She graduated from Barnard College and holds three master's degrees -- in English, comparative literature and creative writing -- and a Ph.D. in Renaissance studies, all from Boston University.</p>
        <p>''My connection with India is fundamental,'' she said in an interview in her publisher's Manhattan office. ''But at the same time it is very slippery and confusing. It has been a cause of bewilderment and sometimes strife and frustration within me. It's a messy thing. But it's been a blessing for me and my writing. I would like to see myself as an American writer. When I was raised I was told not to think of myself as an American. It was important to my mother to raise her children as Indian, thinking and doing things in an Indian way, whatever that means. Even now it is hard for me to say I am American.''</p>
        <p>Her connection to India, she said, is ''in many layers -- from my own encounters with the country, from my visits with my many relatives in Calcutta, and also through my parents, by virtue of being the child of parents who have remained so connected with a place they haven't lived in for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>It is that kind of knowledge, she said, that propels her stories of Indians in what for them is a strange land. But the writers who have influenced her the most, she said, are not Indian. They are instead also strangers in strange lands -- either immigrants or writers who live or lived in a kind of self-imposed exile. They include Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, Mavis Gallant and William Trevor.</p>
        <p>''What I love about these writers is their connection to place, or at least their obsession with place, even if they don't feel connected,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharma, the author of ''An Obedient Father,'' moved to New Jersey from New Delhi with his parents when he was 9, but when it comes to writing about India and Indians, he said, he views himself as ''quite an insider.''</p>
        <p>His resume seems quintessentially American. He took Toni Morrison's writing class at Princeton University, was a Wallace Stegner Fellow in creative writing at Stanford University, went to Harvard Law School and is an investment banker in New York. But ''I've spent a lot of time in India,'' he said. ''I've been back 10 to 15 times, three months or so each visit, a total of three and a half years. India has played a large role in my imagination, and I think I write from an Indian point of view.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Desai, whose novel focuses on the contradictions of modern life in a small Indian town, has been compared by critics to an older generation of Indian writers, among them her mother and R. K. Narayan. Ms. Desai, who has lived in the United States since she was 14 and has a home in Manhattan, spends about half the year in New Delhi. She said she considers herself ''an Indian writer who lives in America.''</p>
        <p>''My own relation to India is a very natural one,'' she said in an interview. ''I find it very easy to reach into my past and write about India, because it is my heritage. It's in my blood. My family lives in both places. These days there's so much coming and going. It's not the old style of immigration.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jha and Mr. Mishra say that in the vastness of India, where their middle-class lives have been the exception rather than the rule, they feel that they are in some ways separate from the real country and its overwhelming issues of poverty and class.</p>
        <p>''When I go home from work I see at every intersection 5-year-olds coming to my car and tapping on the window for some loose change,'' Mr. Jha said. ''I can't escape that reality. It deeply affects me. And at the same time I feel very impotent, because I can't engage with it. And one simply must.''</p>
        <p>Despite the problems and concerns, Mr. Chaudhuri, whose first American book, ''Freedom Song,'' was praised by critics last year and whose new novel, ''A New World,'' is being published by Knopf in October, said he was confident about the future of Indian writing in English.</p>
        <p>''This is the coming of age of a particular generation that suddenly finds the novel an attractive form,'' Mr. Chaudhuri said. '' We need time to witness the evolution, and see what develops.''</p>
