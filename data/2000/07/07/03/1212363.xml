        <p>COPLEY-Stella Yang. Died on June 25, 2000, in NYC. She was 69, and a resident of Washington, CT. She had been ill with pancreatic cancer. She was a graduate of Vassar College and the author of the semi-autobiographical novel ''Crossings'', which she wrote using her Chinese given name, Chuang-Hua. This work was seminal in that it represented one of the first accounts of the complex experience of a Chinese family that emigrated to the United States during the Japanese invasion in the 1930's. She is survived by her daughter, Theodora; her mother, Von Sung; and her siblings, Annie, Gertrude, Alvie, John, George, and Lucy.</p>
