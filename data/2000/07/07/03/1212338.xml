        <p>Casey Fowler  San Carlos Charter Learning Center</p>
        <p>It's hard enough to weather sixth grade under ideal circumstances, let alone hobbled by cerebral palsy.</p>
        <p>What consoles Casey Fowler, 13, whose twisted gait draws occasional titters from his classmates, is that he was not supposed to make it to school at all -- but he has become a strong student at the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, a 60's-tinged experimental public school 25 miles south of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Born 12 weeks early, at 2 pounds 4 ounces, Casey was given little prospect of a normal life, because his brain had been deprived of oxygen during birth.</p>
        <p>''We were told when he was a year old that he was seriously retarded,'' said his mother, Debbie. ''That the only job he'd get would be stacking boxes at Macy's.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Fowler quit her nursing job to work full time on physical and musical therapy with Casey to ease the symptoms of his condition, which causes slow muscle development and muddled speech.</p>
        <p>Not only did Casey's mind blossom -- by age 2 he had the concentration to watch ''The Wizard of Oz'' in its entirety -- but he pushed himself to ride a bike and skate. Though he has the running ability of a 5-year-old, Casey played basketball in the Redwood City Police Athletic League this year on a team that was coached by his father, Ray.</p>
        <p>''I haven't made a shot yet,'' he said. ''I get close. It bounced off the rim two times.''</p>
        <p>Still, Casey's shaky gait and hands make him an easy target for teasing.</p>
        <p>''I've been called a retard,'' Casey told a visitor. But an 11-year-old classmate cut him off.</p>
        <p>''We've already been through this a million times before, in class,'' the boy said.</p>
        <p>Casey just looked away.</p>
        <p>With an encyclopedic knowledge of movies and strong grades in English, Casey hopes to attend U.C.L.A. film school to train as a director or screenwriter or producer.</p>
        <p>''I'm lucky,'' Casey said. ''Other people have it worse.''</p>
