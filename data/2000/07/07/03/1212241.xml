        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''An End to Secret Campaign Funds'' (editorial, June 29): You may have left a misimpression about the contribution of Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, to the passage of landmark legislation to stop abuse by political groups created under Section 527 of the tax code.</p>
        <p>I recall no other instance in my 30 years in the House when the most junior Ways and Means minority-party member succeeded in enacting a tax bill over the overwhelming opposition of the majority leadership. Regrettably, there was some partisanship at times, but not on the part of Mr. Doggett. Twice, the Doggett bill was rejected on straight party-line votes in the Ways and Means Committee. Then, it was rejected twice more on the floor, again by House Republicans following in lock step with their leadership.</p>
        <p>From beginning to end, Mr. Doggett reached across the aisle until he recruited so many Republicans to his cause that the Republican leadership was forced to drop its opposition.</p>
        <p>(Rep.) CHARLES B. RANGEL  Washington, June 29, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.</p>
