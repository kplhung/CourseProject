        <p>The Mets will meet the Atlanta Braves in less than three weeks, and perhaps by then the standing will have changed. Today, it is the same as it was when the first-place Braves came to town. The Braves won yesterday at Shea Stadium, 10-2, to split the four-game series and maintain their two-game lead over the Mets in the National League East.</p>
        <p>Even so, there is an important difference in the way the Mets now see their biggest rival. In future meetings, Mike Piazza is certain, the Mets will not press. These games are not so much about the Braves, he said, as they are about the Mets themselves.</p>
        <p>''I think what happened is, we just felt like it didn't really matter who we were playing,'' Piazza said. ''I don't think we really saw them as the Braves or the 'Team of the 90's' or anything like that. We saw ourselves as playing good baseball. Whatever way you want to take it, that's a positive thing for us.''</p>
        <p>There were not many positives yesterday for the Mets, who were humbled by Tom Glavine. Mets starter Glendon Rusch allowed 13 hits and 7 runs. The best thing that happened for the Mets was probably when John Rocker boarded the Braves' team bus and left Shea. One and all were relieved to be done with that story.</p>
        <p>''We had to deal with a lot of nonsense that wasn't part of the game at all,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''And the game came to the forefront.''</p>
        <p>It did, with a boost from Friday's dramatic 11-8 Mets victory in which they scored 10 runs in the eighth inning, although yesterday's game offered the least for fans to savor.</p>
        <p>After Melvin Mora reached base in the first by bunting for a leadoff single, he tried to advance two bases on a weakly hit comebacker. Glavine tossed to Andres Galarraga at first base for one out before Galarraga fired to third to get Mora easily. The shortstop, who figures to be the Mets' leadoff hitter the rest of the season, is daring on the bases and was running on his own.</p>
        <p>''That's the way I play,'' Mora said. ''My job is to try to take the other team out of concentration. Every time I hit a single, I have to make it a double.''</p>
        <p>But this time, Mora's effort backfired. Instead of having a runner at second, one out and the middle of the order coming up in the inning in which Glavine is usually most vulnerable, the Mets had two outs and the bases empty.</p>
        <p>Glavine retired Edgardo Alfonzo on a groundout, and the Atlanta pitcher permitted only one single and one walk over the next five innings. Piazza and Todd Zeile hit consecutive home runs in the seventh, but those were the only runs allowed by Glavine (8-5). He pitched seven innings, allowing five hits and one walk.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of pitchers that wish they could do what he does, and they can't,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura said. ''That's a credit to him. It just shows you don't have to have a 98-mile-per-hour fastball to get people out.''</p>
        <p>The comparison between Glavine and Rusch is irresistible, and when the left-hander Rusch is pitching well, his teammates often note their similarities. Rusch (6-6) said he tries to model himself after Glavine by throwing down and away consistently.</p>
        <p>But the Braves were crowding the plate on Rusch, trying to take away the outside pitch, and Rusch said he was probably too conscious of that. He tried to come inside more than usual, to back the Braves hitters off, but he left a few balls over the middle and paid for it.</p>
        <p>With one out and runners at second and third in the second inning, Rusch gave up a sacrifice fly to Walt Weiss and the Braves led, 1-0. That began a stretch of five pitches that ended with the Braves leading by 4-0.</p>
        <p>Keith Lockhart swung at the first pitch and grounded a single to right, scoring a run. Glavine lined a single to left, also on the first pitch. Rusch threw a ball to Quilvio Veras, then gave up a two-run double to left.</p>
        <p>''They were aggressive early in the count,'' said Rusch, who did not issue a walk. ''I think they knew that I'm going to be around the plate and throwing strikes, and they tried to get pitches early in the count so they didn't have to chase a pitch with two strikes. They're a good, veteran team.''</p>
        <p>The Braves handed their lead to Glavine -- a good, veteran pitcher -- and the Mets knew he would probably not let it go.</p>
        <p>''Glavine, when he's ahead out there, is very difficult to have a big inning against when he's on,'' Zeile said. ''His first-inning E.R.A. is high, and after that, it's down to microscopic numbers. The further the game goes, the better chance he has to keep his team in there.''</p>
        <p>It all might have been different if Derek Bell had held on to a liner by Reggie Sanders in the second, before the scoring started. Bell dived to his right and gloved the ball, but it popped out when he hit the ground.</p>
        <p>Bell said he joked with the umpires that the ground cannot cause a fumble.</p>
        <p>''Can you give me that?'' Bell asked.</p>
        <p>They could not, of course. The Mets do not get many gifts when they play the Braves. For now, they are pleased to be right where they were before this series.</p>
        <p>''Realistically speaking, a split here is O.K.,'' Zeile said. ''It's not maybe what we would have loved, but given the types of games we had, it's O.K. I think we can live with that and move forward from here.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Mets center fielder JAY PAYTON, who started all 25 games in June and batted .394 for the month, sprained his wrist on his final swing Saturday and was given yesterday off. Payton, who has a 12-game hitting streak, said he expected to play tonight when the Mets visit the Florida Marlins.</p>
