        <p>Joe Torre thought about giving Tino Martinez a day off today, but Martinez was in the lineup against the Devil Rays. Martinez had two hits Saturday, and Torre said he wanted to give his first baseman -- who has struggled this season -- a chance to build on that success.</p>
        <p>But keeping Martinez on the field was probably an adept way of addressing and perhaps defusing the comments Martinez made after Saturday's game. Martinez bristled when reporters conveyed Torre's opinion that the first baseman sometimes pushes himself too hard, and that Saturday's performance might serve to ease some of that self-imposed pressure.</p>
        <p>''It's not a sense of relief,'' Martinez said Saturday. ''I expect it of myself. You're battling your own beliefs, and you're battling your own manager. I never take a day off.</p>
        <p>''It's always, 'I'm pressing.' It's never, 'Let's work on your swing.' Am I pressing? That's the easy way out.''</p>
        <p>When Martinez's comments were relayed to Torre before today's game, the manager said: ''I give my opinion. It looks to me like he's fighting himself. It's not easy to follow up the years he's had year in and year out. In that regard, I'm sure he's frustrated with the fact that it's not happening for him. He's a very proud individual.''</p>
        <p>Martinez drove in 117 runs in 1996, 141 in 1997, 123 in 1998 and 105 last year.</p>
        <p>He went 0 for 4 in today's 5-2 victory and, with 45 runs batted in and 7 home runs is on a pace to drive in 96 runs and hit 15 homers.</p>
        <p>Martinez began his professional career with Seattle, and the Mariners place great emphasis on batting practice, on working endlessly on hitting; he likes to go through extra rounds of hitting, to go through repetitions with his swing.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' approach -- essentially dictated by Torre and the hitting coach Chris Chambliss -- is more measured. When the team is slumping offensively, Torre and Chambliss will sometimes give the hitters a day off, in an effort to relax them.</p>
        <p>Teams don't uniformly take batting practice before most Sunday games, but the Yankees did today -- and the perception of other players is that it was done to placate the likes of Martinez and right fielder Paul O'Neill, who like to put in as much work as possible.</p>
        <p>Torre would not say whether Martinez has said the same thing to him as he did to reporters. ''We talk,'' Torre said. ''I don't go into things that we say behind closed doors. The only thing can do is offer support where I can help, and basically, that's all I can do.''</p>
        <p>Yarnall Ready to Return</p>
        <p>The Yankees will play seven games in six days from July 4-9, and they are unsure who will start two of those games. The left-hander Ed Yarnall, who had a poor spring and missed a chance to open the season in the rotation, has a good chance of being promoted to pitch Thursday against the Orioles. He was removed from Columbus's Class AAA game today after throwing only 59 pitches against Toledo to keep him fresh enough to start Thursday against Baltimore. When spring training started, the Yankees had hoped that Yarnall would be in the rotation and Ramiro Mendoza would be in the bullpen. But Yarnall struggled and Mendoza was inserted into the rotation.</p>
        <p>Jason Grimsley, coming back from an ear infection, could be held back to pitch in Saturday's day-night doubleheader against the Mets.</p>
        <p>Erdos Reassigned</p>
        <p>To make room for Roger Clemens on the 25-man roster, the Yankees designated pitcher Todd Erdos for assignment, a move debated at length by the team's staff this morning. The Yankees could have optioned Ben Ford or Craig Dingman to the minors without complication, but Erdos is out of options and cannot be sent to Class AAA without being passed through waivers.</p>
        <p>There is the possibility, then, that the Yankees will lose Erdos. But the right-hander had been relegated to mop-up duty, compiling a 5.04 earned run average in only 14 appearances; it had become apparent that Torre was not going to trust Erdos more than that.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, both Dingman and Ford have had impressive outings in the last 10 days, and the consensus might have been that either had more of a chance of succeeding in a crucial role than Erdos. ''We feel right now that maybe the other guys can help us better,'' said Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager.</p>
        <p>Turner Mends; Knoblauch Sits</p>
        <p>Chris Turner, the Yankees' backup catcher, was nursing a stiff shoulder today, a problem that probably began in Saturday's brawl. Turner was one of the players who wrestled Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith away from Jorge Posada after those two started fighting. Turner took some medication today and believes he will be ready to play Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the second baseman, was not in the lineup for the second consecutive day because of an ear infection, the same problem that has plagued Grimsley. The air-conditioning was out in most rooms in the Yankees' team hotel in Detroit last week, and for that reason, Knoblauch stayed in Grimsley's room, where the air-conditioning was freezing cold. Both got sick.</p>
