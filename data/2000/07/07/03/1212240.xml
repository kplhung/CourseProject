        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a Columbia University alumna whose child attended a selective public school in the Columbia area, I support the university's plan to create a private school for the children of faculty members and neighborhood  children (front page, June 28).</p>
        <p>The schools serving children in the Columbia area are plagued by all of the disabilities of the city's school system, including overcrowding, a constantly changing curriculum, high teacher turnover and the self-defeating racial politics that led District 3 to contend that a building in Central Harlem, separated from the Columbia area by Morningside Park, was an appropriate site for a school serving the Columbia community.</p>
        <p>The proposed school will provide much-needed facilities for Columbia personnel who would otherwise be eminently justified in accepting jobs elsewhere, while enabling at least some of the many low-income children in the neighborhood to obtain the education that every child deserves.</p>
