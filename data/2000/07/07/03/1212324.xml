        <p>David Justice did not bring an entourage when he joined the Yankees. He seems more like a kid switching to a new grade school, genial but quiet among new teammates. Justice noticed that almost all of the Yankees have the cuffs of their pants set just above the ankles, and before today's game, Justice had his pants adjusted as well.</p>
        <p>The conformity that matters most, however, will be in his run production, and Justice had his first hit with the Yankees today and drove in two runs as they completed a turbulent 13-game trip by beating Tampa Bay, 5-2. Roger Clemens was activated from the disabled list and pitched efficiently and effectively, allowing three hits, two walks and a run over seven innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' record and place in the standings hasn't changed that much since June 18, when they last played in Yankee Stadium. They were five games over .500 and one-half game behind the first-place Boston Red Sox in the American League East when they began their road trip. They are now four games over .500, at 40-36, and one game behind the first-place Toronto Blue Jays. But they are a different team, in literal terms, jettisoning Jim Leyritz, Ricky Ledee and Todd Erdos over the last two weeks and adding infielder Jose Vizcaino, pitcher Ben Ford and Justice.</p>
        <p>It's exciting being with a new team, Justice said after today's game, ''and it's scary sometimes, no matter where you go.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I've been in a comfort zone; I've been in the same type of routine for the past three and a half years. It's just a matter of basically getting into another one.''</p>
        <p>Justice was hitless in his first two days with the Yankees, and he admitted to being somewhat anxious, even at age 34, trying to get that first hit for his new team, trying to fit in. He changed his socks but put his underwear on backward, a mistake pointed out by his new teammate Felix Jose; Justice laughed along and decided to keep it that way, just to see how it worked.</p>
        <p>And it worked well. Justice pulled a single to right-center in the second inning, driving home Bernie Williams with the first run, and with the bases loaded in the third, he hit a sharp grounder to first, enabling Derek Jeter to cross the plate with the Yankees' third run. ''He's a legitimate hitter and he is going to be a good guy in big situations,'' Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said.</p>
        <p>There was no telling how much run support Clemens would need, if he would even last five innings. He went on the disabled list 18 days ago after straining his right groin and spent most that time training at the Yankees' facility in Tampa, Fla. Clemens tracked the Yankees, feeling frustrated when they struggled. He would see the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, who hit him with a good-natured verbal jab, telling him he was needed back in the big leagues.</p>
        <p>Clemens (5-6) seemed particularly anxious before today's game, teammates said, stalking through the clubhouse purposefully, no one saying anything to him, giving him personal space. The pitcher ''walks around like Alfred Hitchcock'' in the clubhouse, Torre said. ''He's in the movie, but nobody's supposed to know about it.''</p>
        <p>He went to the bullpen to warm up about 10 minutes before he usually does, to get loose and to see how the muscles around his legs felt, and to have a little extra time just in case he required a little extra wrapping.</p>
        <p>But Clemens felt great, threw hard and threw lots of strikes, his pace and mechanics steady. Clemens usually averages about 18 pitches an inning, and today, he needed only 87 over seven innings, an average of 12 an inning. ''Maybe this two-week stint on the disabled list helped more than just physically,'' Torre said. ''It helped him to organize his thoughts and then get ready to pitch. Today he seemed like he was very focused and very aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Clemens's outing was the seventh time in the 13 games on this trip that the Yankees got a good pitching effort, and they won six of those seven games. The Yankees won the first two games of the 13-game trip, and the last two games.</p>
        <p>Torre felt a rebirth of energy in his players Saturday, right after Jorge Posada was involved in a fight with Tampa Bay's Bobby Smith. Immediately after play resumed, Jeter made a diving play to his left, and it was as if that intensity carried over into today's game. Scott Brosius, the third baseman, made three nice plays, and Williams and Shane Spencer both made running catches in the outfield, and Clemens was focused, working fast.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' rotation had been in shambles because of injury, but now four-fifths of the rotation is intact -- Clemens and Orlando Hernandez, David Cone and Andy Pettitte in line; Ramiro Mendoza is the only sidelined starter.</p>
        <p>''We've been looking to put something together,'' Torre said. ''Hopefully, this will start us into a good streak.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's STEVE TRACHSEL, one of the pitchers who may become available before the July 31 trade deadline, pitched Sunday against the Yankees, one of the teams who may add a pitcher soon. He was knocked around, allowing five runs in five innings. ''Some of the guys have been teasing me about it,'' Trachsel said. ''Guys were saying it's like a showcase game or something like that. But I can't imagine any major league team determining the trade value of a player on one game.''</p>
        <p>The All-Star Game teams will be named this week, and the Yankees figure to have at least three representatives. Center fielder BERNIE WILLIAMS has consistently ranked among the top three outfielders in the voting, and even if he were to drop out of the top three, he has the credentials to be selected as a reserve. Catcher  JORGE POSADA is batting .314, with an on-base percentage of .444 -- MICKEY COCHRANE is the only catcher in history to have an on-base percentage of more than .450 -- and JOE TORRE, the American League manager, typically looks for opportunities to reward his players. Shortstop DEREK JETER is batting .325, and despite missing 12 games because of injury, he is on a pace to collect more than 200 hits. MARIANO RIVERA, the closer, has converted 18 of 21 save chances.</p>
