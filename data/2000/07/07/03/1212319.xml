        <p>Lauriston Nunes takes sample SAT's as if he were taking batting practice, signing onto a Web site with practice questions a few afternoons a week from his home near Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Chanel Meanor regularly awakes with a start past midnight, fretting about overlapping assignments at her Silicon Valley school. ''Sometimes I'll wake up thinking something's due the next day,'' she said, ''and it's not.''</p>
        <p>After a Duke University basketball game a few months ago, Max Mashore's father introduced him to a university admissions officer, who told Max to take Spanish rather than Latin and sign up for calculus as soon as possible at his school in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>These students have one thing in common: They are in sixth grade.</p>
        <p>On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an age of bubbling hormones and anti-authority stirrings, sixth graders today face a combination of pressures that their parents never encountered.</p>
        <p>To understand how the country's continuing educational makeover and the pace of American society are transforming the lives of students, The New York Times conducted round-table discussions over the past six months with 221 sixth graders, youngsters on the bridge between childhood and adolescence, at 21 schools -- public and private, cutthroat and coddling -- in 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>The interviews showed that with a college degree increasingly seen as a prerequisite for a decent life -- and admission to prestigious universities more competitive than ever -- higher education has become a preoccupation for children even before they reach puberty.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the students face new layers of standardized tests that judge not only what they know -- and whether they should be promoted -- but the performance of their teachers, their schools and their towns.</p>
        <p>Concerned about the future of the nation's economy, American educators have over the past decade imported pages from the strict curriculums of Asian schools and Europe's elite academies, imposing the rigor and seriousness of high school on the lower grades. Though the United States has surpassed its competitors economically, public dissatisfaction with the preparation of American workers remains, heightening the hurdles for students.</p>
        <p>In this era of earlier and higher expectations, most of the students interviewed said they were driven to excel by parents who had seized on test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for success.</p>
        <p>Some of the students suffer tension headaches and bouts of anxiety, raising questions about the costs of growing up quickly. But a number of the students embraced this intense focus on the future, saying it gave more meaning and direction to their lives than idle hours in front of the television.</p>
        <p>They drink in the challenges like a first sip of coffee, a tantalizing if slightly bitter taste of adulthood.</p>
        <p>''I try to strive for stuff that I know I can't achieve right now,'' said Yesenia Mendez, 13, of Boston. ''I read harder books that I can't understand right now.''</p>
        <p>Yesenia attends the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a three-year-old charter school that has adopted some Asian educational principles -- children take martial arts for gym, clean their own classrooms and are often rewarded or disciplined as a group for an individual's behavior.</p>
        <p>''I stay in school longer than my mother goes to work sometimes,'' Yesenia said of the 210-day calendar of classes stretching from 8:05 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. ''I feel like I need to get paid.''</p>
        <p>Though Manhattan's prestigious private schools are well known for their pressure-cooker atmosphere, the interviews show that similar stresses pervade students' lives regardless of geography or socioeconomic station. In fact, students at the nation's most expensive academies seemed among those most at ease, perhaps confident that their course in life was assured.</p>
        <p>The level of anxiety prevalent in sixth-grade lunchrooms appeared almost to grow in proportion to a school's distance from the ivory towers of the Northeast. Middle-class children in cookie-cutter subdivisions say they fear that attending no-name local universities will consign them to mediocrity, while minority students and those living in poverty are scrambling to prepare themselves for any college, a path pursued by few of their predecessors.</p>
        <p>In affluent Newton, Mass., and suburban Orlando, Fla., children are already drawing road maps to follow their parents' footsteps into the Ivy League; in the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Milwaukee and New York, there are also sixth graders fixated on Harvard and Yale as their ticket to surpass relatives who never finished high school.</p>
        <p>At a Muslim school in Atlanta, just as at a Jewish school in Las Vegas, preteenage overachievers sweat even fractional fluctuations in grade-point average. From Nogales, Ariz., on the Mexican border, to East Palo Alto, Calif., a ghetto bordering the mansions of Silicon Valley, tutors and resume-padding activities have supplanted after-school play dates.</p>
        <p>That means 10 more years of hated piano lessons for Lucy McDaniel, 12, whose mother tells her that music improves math scores. ''I barely even get to go outside when I get home,'' said Lucy, who attends the Westminster Schools in Atlanta, where tuition is more than $12,000 a year.</p>
        <p>As sixth graders confront these challenges, they also worry that the school shootings they see on television will invade their own classrooms, and they are saddled with new responsibilities in families overwhelmed by dual careers or damaged by divorce.</p>
        <p>Even educators are confounded by this precarious age. In some districts, sixth grade is elementary school's finale, with recess and classrooms as comforting as warm milk; elsewhere, it is the opening act of middle school, where sixth graders switch rooms for every subject and fumble with locker combinations while jostled by eighth graders topping six feet.</p>
        <p>No matter the setting, the sixth-grade curriculum is changing, too, as teachers and parents push higher-level material like geometry and geology, a trickle-down effect from high schools, where enrollment in college-level advanced placement courses has doubled over the last decade.</p>
        <p>''There's too much going on in sixth grade,'' said Nora Farley, 12, of Pleasantville, N.Y., in Westchester County. ''It's all being crammed in your brain. It's too much to take.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are sizable pockets of students at private and public schools who say they feel little pressure in their lives and who have given no thought to college. But it was only at a one-room schoolhouse in Montana that the sixth graders -- both of them -- seemed confused by the very notion of pressure.</p>
        <p>Most schools were more like Mantua Elementary in Fairfax County, Va., where the county requires a one-time class lesson on stress -- and how to deal with it -- for every sixth grader.</p>
        <p>''What happened to childhood?'' asked Ellen S. Schoetzau, 45, Mantua's principal. ''The pressures on children are much greater now than when I was teaching -- certainly than when I was in school.''</p>
        <p>The View  Does Any School Beat Harvard?</p>
        <p>One new chain of thought that runs nearly unbroken through today's sixth-grade classrooms is the belief that a college degree -- particularly a parchment from someplace with a pedigree -- comes with a passkey to the good life.</p>
        <p>''I just see education as the way to get rich,'' said Keenan Robinson, 12, the son of a tax appraiser and a secretary from DeKalb County, Ga., outside Atlanta. ''You can't get a multimillion-dollar entertainment company by being a bum on the street.''</p>
        <p>Keenan, who used to live in New York, wants to attend St. John's University. ''That's all that runs through my mind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With applications to four-year colleges, especially the most selective, increasing every year, the intense competition over admission is filtering all the way down to sixth grade.</p>
        <p>Students like Keenan are not just ruminating about colleges; they are researching them. In Las Vegas, Nogales, Atlanta and Milwaukee, among other places, sixth graders reported surfing college home pages on the Web, some with an eye on future majors, others seeking scholarship opportunities.</p>
        <p>''I'm not really thinking so much about which college,'' said Chelsea Hammack, 12, whose father is a Las Vegas police officer and whose mother works in a casino. ''It's more, what am I going to do when I get there?</p>
        <p>''Once in a while me and my parents talk about what I'm going to take for my subject that could help me with the job I want to do,'' said Chelsea, an aspiring writer (''fiction, short stories, mostly''). ''I want to take something I'm interested in, but not something that's so easy I won't learn anything.''</p>
        <p>Chelsea has been using the Web to compare Brigham Young University in Utah with a college in Hawaii. ''I'm sort of split between the two,'' she said. ''I'm actually thinking of going to U.N.L.V. for a year to get a better chance of getting into a good school.''</p>
        <p>That is why Lauriston Nunes, the 12-year-old Atlanta boy who drills himself on the SAT's, keeps going back to the Web site of the College Board, www.collegeboard.com.</p>
        <p>''The first few times I went there, I got every question right,'' he said. ''It makes me feel smart. It lets me know that I can do more than what I have to do right now.''</p>
        <p>Lauriston is already experimenting with a kind of higher education: a school for models, Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. ''I like being on stage,'' he said. ''I like seeing people clap for me.''</p>
        <p>For other students, particularly those with older siblings, weekend activities include leafing through college guidebooks -- or even visiting campuses. Kristen Summerall is getting advice from her sister, a high school junior.</p>
        <p>''She's going to Spelman, I wanted to go to Harvard,'' said Kristen, 12, a 4.0 student at Stephenson Middle School outside Atlanta. ''Then I was like, 'Is there a school better than Harvard?' She was like, 'Its initials are M.I.T.' It's in Michigan or something.</p>
        <p>''The farthest I've ever been is Virginia,'' she added. ''I want to see more of the United States. When I was little, I used to tell my parents I wanted to leave the United States and go to school in Paris.''</p>
        <p>Some children are clearly self-motivated, but more often the prod is a parent or grandparent -- whose success in life has set an example that students want to follow, or whose failures the children hope to avoid.</p>
        <p>Max Mashore's pilgrimages to Duke, his dad's alma mater, began in second grade. Max went to a basketball camp at Duke last summer.</p>
        <p>''This whole year I've been thinking about college,'' said Max, a B student at Sidwell Friends school in Washington who was wearing his Duke sweatshirt, as usual.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to go to some small college in the middle of Maine or something.'' he said. ''I heard someone say once, 'C is community college, B is state college, A is Ivy League school.' ''</p>
        <p>Rahel Haile, 12, of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx, said her parents, immigrants from Eritrea, were determined that she achieve more than they have. Rahel's father, a grocery store manager, went to Rutgers, but that ''isn't the best college,'' Rahel said.</p>
        <p>''Since third and fifth grade, I used to think I wanted to go to Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,'' she said. ''I was looking at Harvard. I don't want to sound harsh, but Harvard was just too preppy for me. I'd rather go to N.Y.U.''</p>
        <p>One might expect students at Fieldston, a feeder school to the Ivy League, to have a college focus -- though perhaps not at age 12. But what is striking is the nervous attention to college admission -- fed by misinformation -- in schools elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Sixth graders in suburban Washington, Las Vegas, Nogales and East Palo Alto all believe, mistakenly, that colleges will examine elementary school transcripts.</p>
        <p>''If you go to Stanford, they might look at your records and see if you've been bad,'' said Tuuta Tuipulotu, 11, who is worried that his one-day suspension at his northern California school, for fighting, might result in a rejection letter.</p>
        <p>For the college class of 2010, it seems, it is never too early to start.</p>
        <p>''With the Ivy League schools, my dad always says that to get into them, it's like a race,'' said Joshua Bordin, 12, the son of a Pleasantville businessman and nursery school teacher. ''Let's say we could put the whole grade in a race. People have to fall. People have to stop to tie a shoe. But if you keep getting good grades, you race and race to the top.''</p>
        <p>The Tests  'I'm Worried If I'll Get Held Back'</p>
        <p>In Arizona, it is AIMS. In Massachusetts, M.C.A.S. Florida has the FCAT. Virginia, the SOL. In East Palo Alto, there is the SAT-9 and the R-SAT. Las Vegas spells it out: Terra Nova, which greets sixth graders just a month after they arrive at middle school.</p>
        <p>They are the standardized tests beloved by politicians, business leaders and those who call themselves education reformers, and they have sixth graders nationwide chewing on their No. 2 pencils. The tests are part of a concerted effort to elevate achievement, leaving students far more worried than their predecessors that poor marks could land them in remedial classes, in summer school or even back to suffer sixth grade all over again next year.</p>
        <p>''They can feel the pressure,'' said Mark A. Valenzuela, the principal of Desert Shadows Middle School in Nogales, ''from teachers, administrators, parents, older siblings -- from older students in the school.''</p>
        <p>It will be two years before Nogales sixth graders face the new state tests, the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards, and four years before they take a math exam required for a high school diploma. Still, Mr. Valenzuela convened an assembly this spring to tell sixth graders, many of them the children of truckers and distributors in the tomato industry, that their homework today is critical to their AIMS performance.</p>
        <p>To Ben Larriva, 11, such warnings echo the daily mantra from his teachers: ''This will be on the AIMS test.'' Ben, whose parents unplug his computer if he slips off the honor roll, is warily watching his brother's experience in eighth grade. ''He can't keep up,'' Ben said.</p>
        <p>The pressure is more immediate at the Menlo Oaks School, where the have-nots of Silicon Valley must pass a standardized state test in three subjects to be promoted and take the Ravenswood Stanford Achievement Tests, a set of district exams, for three days each quarter.</p>
        <p>''Every time I take a test, I get nervous,'' said Jeremiah Sagote, 11, the son of a truck mechanic and a store clerk from Samoa. ''Not like a spelling test -- I don't get nervous on those. Like the R-SAT test. I'm worried if I'll get held back.''</p>
        <p>Jeremiah's expression of concern about promotion was repeated by sixth graders across the country. And, with scores published in local newspapers, students in several districts said they were also anxious about what the tests meant for the teachers they love (or hate).</p>
        <p>''I think sometimes the teachers have the tendency to stress them out,'' said Clara Rice, the principal at Menlo Oaks. ''Because the teachers will look bad if the students don't do well. Their jobs are on the line. The principal's job. And the superintendent's.''</p>
        <p>Private schools are not immune, either. At Fieldston, sixth graders have been taking standardized tests since kindergarten, and they were frazzled by a recent math exam.</p>
        <p>''We had 30 minutes to do this test, which means we had like a minute and 5 seconds to do each problem,'' Joseph DeJesus, 12, said. ''Most of those problems took two to three minutes.''</p>
        <p>Rocky Russo, 12, another Fieldston student, said he felt as if he was being used. ''You think they could come up with a better way to figure out if the teachers are doing their jobs correctly,'' Rocky said.</p>
        <p>In Fairfax County, students expressed frustration that a test on Virginia history had squeezed other educational activities out of the schedule.</p>
        <p>''We were going to have an archaeological dig, make artifacts and bury them, and another class would dig them up, and it would be really cool,'' said Monica Kumar, 11, a student at Mantua Elementary.</p>
        <p>Instead, Monica's class spent two weeks reviewing for Virginia's Standards of Learning test. ''The teachers stuck note cards from every single event -- from when Jamestown was founded to Arthur Ashe winning tennis tournaments -- they put them all around the walls,'' said Meredith Keller, 12, a classmate.</p>
        <p>With stakes so high, grades now count more than ever.</p>
        <p>''I got a B on a homework assignment,'' said Julia Cohen of Newton, Mass., a Boston suburb known for its stellar schools. ''It, like, ruined it. I couldn't say I'd gotten all A's. Everyone was making fun of me.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to get A's, then you might as well get them all the time.''</p>
        <p>To that end, many families have devised intricate incentive plans borrowed from corporate America and pegged to even the most mundane assignment.</p>
        <p>Jon Lipinski of San Carlos, Calif., used to write one-sentence responses to homework questions. Then his mother, an emergency medical technician, started paying him two cents per word. Now, Jon says he can pull down ''six bucks'' an essay. His mother also pays 10 cents for every page he reads, and Jon says he is owed $44.</p>
        <p>At Sidwell Friends, where Chelsea Clinton is an alumna, Cameron Pastrick is striving to reach a B average by employing tutors four times a week. To stay focused while doing her homework, she uses an egg timer.</p>
        <p>''My mom's always like, I can't get you any more tutors, unless you want one Friday and Saturday and Sunday,'' said Cameron, who has had tutors since third grade.</p>
        <p>''My mom went here. Whenever I bring home, like, a C, she's like, 'When I was your age, I got an A,' '' Cameron said. ''I keep telling them this, and they say, 'We don't pressure you, we encourage you.' ''</p>
        <p>The Outside Forces  Fear of Guns In the Schoolroom</p>
        <p>As high academic expectations hang over their young lives, this year's sixth graders have been distracted by outside forces that did not buffet their predecessors.</p>
        <p>Five months after the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., Mia Grill skipped the first day at Molasky Middle School in Las Vegas. She was nervous that it would prove more violent than her elementary school because the pupils were older.</p>
        <p>''My mom, she said not to worry,'' said Mia, 12, whose parents sell tile. ''I'm still worried. Sooner or later, someone's probably going to bring a gun to school.''</p>
        <p>In the New York borough of Queens, Christopher Bennett's mind sometimes fills with doomsday scenarios as he moves through the hallways of Public School 21, a tan-brick box of an elementary school crammed with Eastern European and Asian immigrants.</p>
        <p>''When we do a silent meeting after lunch,'' said Chris, 11, ''I always look at the door and imagine someone big and dressed all in black coming through.''</p>
        <p>For others, though, the classroom is a respite from home lives rendered turbulent by parents' work schedules or divorce.</p>
        <p>A cog in an increasingly mobile work force, Suzannah Mullen's mother has been shuttled through four states in recent years, often starting new jobs before her family can catch up. Suzannah, 11, and her older sister stayed with their father in the Orlando suburbs this spring while her mother, a human resources administrator, commuted to Charlotte, N.C. ''Sometimes, I kind of search my house for my mom and it's like, 'Oh, she's in North Carolina,' '' Suzannah said.</p>
        <p>Joaquin Vega lives with his mother in Milwaukee, but said he might as well live alone. While Joaquin likes the DVD player and big-screen television paid for by his mother's job at a car dealership, he said they ''can't pay for the time she's gone.''</p>
        <p>''I would like her to help me with my homework,'' Joaquin said, adding that he has never met his father. ''If we have teacher conferences, she can't come. I was on the basketball team. I got first place, and she couldn't come to the ceremony.''</p>
        <p>Kayleigh Wittman, 12, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., also a child of divorce, gets a monthly allowance of $110 -- but she said that had to cover all her expenses, from shampoo to tithing and saving for college.</p>
        <p>''I write down how much money I use, and what I use it on,'' she said. When Kayleigh worried aloud about paying for her future education, saying she expects no further subsidy from her family, a classmate seated nearby wondered, ''Why don't you just save all your money for college?''</p>
        <p>''Because,'' Kayleigh said, ''I have to pay for lunch.''</p>
        <p>The Toll  Defining Stress And Dealing With It</p>
        <p>At Mantua Elementary, a red-brick school a few miles down a wooded road from Prosperity Avenue in Fairfax, Va., stress is part of the curriculum: the county mandates a lesson on the subject for every sixth-grade class.</p>
        <p>In a recent session, Suzzette Rodriguez's students easily defined the word. ''A thought or something that you think about that causes strain on your mind,'' Matt Wong explained. ''On your body, too. Say you have a big test coming up. Your body stiffens.''</p>
        <p>But, echoing some educators, Jenny Drenkard said, ''A little bit of stress is probably actually good for you. You shouldn't be so laid-back that nothing matters.''</p>
        <p>Ranking the stresses in their lives on work sheets, most of the students placed school difficulties and divorced parents highest. (One boy offered a write-in candidate: ''Girls in general.'') When talking in groups about their most stressful situations, every cluster of children picked tests. As for the side effects, they listed headaches, queasiness, anger, depression, insomnia, exhaustion, lack of appetite and butterflies in the stomach.</p>
        <p>At the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, an alternative public school in the Silicon Valley that does not use letter grades, many of the 15 students interviewed, including Chanel Meanor, said they had at least two bouts of sleeplessness a month because of pending schoolwork.</p>
        <p>A coast away in Atlanta, John Hobart said that while baseball was ''probably my favorite thing in the world to do,'' he had so much homework this year that ''I get really excited when I don't have practice because I can relax.''</p>
        <p>And Sonia Dahliwal, a student at Teague Middle School in Altamonte Springs, Fla., is so desperate to get into the English class for gifted students that it is starting to show. ''As you can see I don't like eating,'' Sonia, 13, said with a sour face. ''I have better things to do than put stuff in my mouth and chew.''</p>
        <p>At Oaklands Elementary in Prince George's County, Md., Calisa Carter just dreams, every day, about being back in fifth grade.</p>
        <p>''The only time that I don't feel stressed out is nighttime,'' she said, ''when I'm sleeping.''</p>
        <p>But even as Calisa yearns for the past, other sixth graders are already looking beyond the summer to the fall -- and the pressures next year will bring.</p>
        <p>Helen Park, 12, of Queens, recently toured her new junior high school, No. 185, near the elementary school that has been her security blanket, P.S. 21. ''I heard a group of people there saying, 'I can't wait till Freshman Friday,' '' she said. ''I think they beat you up.''</p>
        <p>For many, the new school year will be filled with firsts: foreign language instruction, math and English classes sifted by students' academic abilities and junior varsity athletic tryouts.</p>
        <p>Michael Bartomioli, 12, plans to play football, which means he will be required to attend practice daily until dusk even though he is very likely to warm the bench behind the bigger boys on the roster. He is already worried about starting his homework -- sure to be heavier -- three hours later than he did this year.</p>
