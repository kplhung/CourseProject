        <p>Despite predictions of a neck-and-neck race for the Independence Day weekend box office between a pair of big-studio behemoths, it turned out to be not much of a race at all. ''The Perfect Storm'' blew away ''The Patriot,'' earning an estimated $41.7 million since its Friday opening, compared with $21.6 million for its rival, a Revolutionary War epic.</p>
        <p>The third major opening of the weekend, the family-oriented ''Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' registered barely a blip, earning just $6.6 million and ending up in fifth place behind the animated ''Chicken Run,'' with $12.8 million, and the Jim Carrey comedy ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' with $12 million.</p>

        <p>Despite predictions of a neck-and-neck race for the Independence Day weekend box office between a pair of big-studio behemoths, it turned out to be not much of a race at all. ''The Perfect Storm'' blew away ''The Patriot,'' earning an estimated $41.7 million since its Friday opening, compared with $21.6 million for its rival, a Revolutionary War epic.</p>
        <p>The third major opening of the weekend, the family-oriented ''Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' registered barely a blip, earning just $6.6 million and ending up in fifth place behind the animated ''Chicken Run,'' with $12.8 million, and the Jim Carrey comedy ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' with $12 million.</p>
        <p>The holiday weekend shakedown was of particular importance in Hollywood this year because the summer movie season, which runs from Memorial Day to Labor Day, had been in a slump in recent weeks, at least compared with last summer's record-setting pace. Many were hoping that strong showings by the holiday films would power a strong second half for the summer, traditionally the most lucrative moviegoing period.</p>
        <p>''Overall the box office is up for the first time in three weeks, and that's good,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office performance. ''This was a pivotal weekend for the summer because with that slump we were in, we really needed a weekend to bring us out of the doldrums.''</p>
        <p>The top 12 movies earned an estimated $121.7 million over the three days ending today, up 5.3 percent from last year's total for the same period. The rise comes after three consecutive weekends in which the box office fell around 20 percent compared with the same weekend last year.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely good news, because it means that audiences are excited about the movies that were playing this weekend,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said.</p>
        <p>But whether this weekend's rise will be strong enough to resuscitate the summer box office remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>''Now, hopefully, the pictures will hold on,'' said Tom Sherak, longtime distribution chief for 20th Century Fox. ''These pictures just need to hold on so the exhibition world can get a little more healthy.''</p>
        <p>Overall, the weekend provided spectacular news for Warner Brothers and its ''Perfect Storm,'' which exceeded most expectations and provided the largest three-day opening in the studio's history and the biggest openings ever for its director, Wolfgang Petersen, and its star, George Clooney. It was also the third highest-grossing Fourth of July release in history, behind 1997's ''Men in Black,'' with $51.1 million, and 1996's ''Independence Day,'' with $50.2 million.</p>
        <p>''We dominated the weekend, making almost double the second-place film,'' said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Brothers. ''And we still have two big days before the holiday is over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fellman credited Mr. Petersen's direction and the spectacular special-effects by Industrial Light and Magic with making the difference, as well as the studio's advertising campaign, nearly ubiquitous in recent weeks, showing a fishing boat dwarfed by a huge wall of water. Of special importance, he said, was the film's PG-13 rating, which expanded the potential audience. ''The Patriot'' is rated R.</p>
        <p>As with ''The Patriot,'' the audience that turned out for ''The Perfect Storm'' was primarily those over 25. But Mr. Petersen's sea adventure, based on the best-selling book by Sebastian Junger about a devastating 1991 storm and its effect on a boat crew of Massachusetts fishermen, drew an audience that was slightly skewed toward women, about 53 percent female and 47 percent male.</p>
        <p>If the film can now begin to attract more young people, who make up the bulk of the summer movie audience, it stands a good chance of becoming the second $200-million film of the summer, after ''Mission:Impossible 2,'' which opened over the Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>''We'll be around $75 million for our first week and certainly have $100 million in 14 days or less,'' Mr. Fellman said. ''It certainly has the potential to be a $200 million movie.''</p>
        <p>This was also a very good weekend for DreamWorks, which added 400 screens for its critically praised ''Chicken Run'' and saw only a 27 percent decline on its second weekend, indicating that the film is also enjoying strong word of mouth. By comparison, Fox's ''Me, Myself and Irene'' saw a 50 percent dropoff in its second weekend and, despite the star power of Mr. Carrey, ended up finishing behind ''Chicken Run.''</p>
        <p>Today's box-office figures are based on actual ticket sales from Friday and Saturday and estimates by each of the studios of Sunday ticket sales. Final figures for the weekend will be made public on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Columbia Pictures was putting the best spin possible on the opening weekend for ''The Patriot,'' a film that many expected to end up in first place, largely on the strength of the drawing power of its star, Mel Gibson, and the track record of its director, Roland Emmerich. But its R-rating and a running time of 2 hours 40 minutes may have worked against it, as well as an aversion among young moviegoers to period pictures.</p>
        <p>''The Patriot'' opened on Wednesday, hoping to take maximum advantage of this year's long holiday weekend, with the Fourth falling on a Tuesday. Instead, the studio estimated the film would finish its first week with about $43 million, only slightly more than ''Perfect Storm'' made in its first three days.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we played a bit more adult than we had anticipated, because of the ratings and the subject matter,'' said Jeff Blake, Columbia's head of distribution. ''We didn't play like an R-rated action film. Now we have to do what we have to do to become the best-holding movie of the summer.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Blake said the exit polls were strong, and ''The Patriot'' saw a 25 percent rise in ticket sales from Friday to Saturday, so there are hopes that the movie will still do very well. ''Though perhaps it will be more in a long-run way,'' he said. ''I think we have a wonderful chance to be the adult film of the summer.''</p>
        <p>Mark Gordon, one of the film's producers, said that he had always anticipated such an opening, since the film's main audience is older and less inclined to run out and see something on its first weekend. He pointed to other recent films, including ''Saving Private Ryan,'' which he also produced, as having similar openings yet going on to extremely lucrative runs.</p>
        <p>''It's always a great thing to crow about,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''Oh, we won the weekend.' But I'd rather look at the great business the weekend held for everybody. We're not in competition with anybody. There's room for several good pictures.''</p>
