        <p>BASEBALL is a numbers game: batting averages, earned run averages, games ahead, games behind. This morning, the numbers show that, for all the excitement of a four-game series that was framed by waves of police officers, the Mets still trail the Braves by two games.</p>
        <p>''In a way,'' the Mets' Mike Piazza said after yesterday's 10-2 shellacking by Atlanta at Shea Stadium, ''it was a wash. But there was a lot of excitement for the fans and players. I'm glad it's behind us. But we're where we were coming into the series.''</p>

        <p>BASEBALL is a numbers game: batting averages, earned run averages, games ahead, games behind. This morning, the numbers show that, for all the excitement of a four-game series that was framed by waves of police officers, the Mets still trail the Braves by two games.</p>
        <p>''In a way,'' the Mets' Mike Piazza said after yesterday's 10-2 shellacking by Atlanta at Shea Stadium, ''it was a wash. But there was a lot of excitement for the fans and players. I'm glad it's behind us. But we're where we were coming into the series.''</p>
        <p>Are they really?</p>
        <p>As players spoke after yesterday's game, there was the distinct sense -- from each team's veterans -- that numbers do not begin to tell the story of this rivalry or this race. That the distance that separates these two teams in the National League East can no longer be measured by games, but by intangibles.</p>
        <p>As Derek Bell, the Mets right fielder, left the clubhouse yesterday, he was asked if he thought Atlanta's two-game lead was as daunting as it was on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''No, no, no,'' Bell said. ''We showed today that we're not going anywhere, that we're going to keep coming at them.''</p>
        <p>When the series opened, the 31-year-old Bell cautioned that the season was like a war, with long months of ebbs and flows. What mattered was surviving the war and winning the crucial playoff battles in October.</p>
        <p>What mattered less were personal streaks, and Bell had two of those stopped yesterday: his 12-game hitting streak and his 11-game run-scoring streak, which was a team record.</p>
        <p>Bell said that in the long view of a baseball season, streaks can be restarted and losses can be absorbed. The important thing is that the Mets introduced an element of doubt to Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''We showed Atlanta that we can play with them,'' Bell said. ''We showed them that we can score runs off their pitchers. They know we're here and that we're not moving.''</p>
        <p>The Mets were defeated Thursday, staged one of the greatest rallies in franchise history Friday by scoring 10 runs in the eighth inning, and walloped Greg Maddux for seven runs on Saturday. Yesterday, they were victimized by Tom Glavine, who pitched one of his best games of the season.</p>
        <p>But back-to-back home runs by Piazza and Todd Zeile -- despite coming in a losing effort -- were yet more signals that the older-sibling/younger-sibling relationship between Atlanta and the Mets had changed.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people only look at numbers,'' Zeile said about the standing. ''We came in the series two games behind and we're still two games behind. But if you take anything out of this, it's that we don't have that same feeling of the Braves being invincible.''</p>
        <p>There was an unusual sense of relief in the Atlanta clubhouse. Glavine, surrounded by a flock of news media representatives, said he was simply happy that he gave his team a chance to win. Someone asked if the split with the Mets helped Atlanta reaffirm its position as the dominant team in the National League.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that we need affirmation of who we are,'' Glavine said. ''But to split this series and go home is nice from a psychological standpoint. But even if we lost three out of four, we wouldn't have panicked about that, either.''</p>
        <p>This was a series of lessons. Glendon Rusch, the Mets' 26-year-old starter, was battered yesterday. The Braves, sobered by two consecutive defeats, attacked Rusch from the beginning and never let up.</p>
        <p>''They were aggressive,'' Rusch said. ''When they saw a pitch to hit, they went after it.''</p>
        <p>Rusch, the youngster, watched the veteran Glavine.</p>
        <p>''He didn't give in -- that's one thing I learned from him today,'' Rusch said. ''He didn't give in. He gave up some hits, but he kept coming back. It was good for me to see that.''</p>
        <p>The Mets should also be buoyed by the fact that the Braves have to pull around the added weight of a silly young relief pitcher who cannot leave well enough alone. John Rocker has painted a nonerasable bull's-eye on Atlanta's collective back. While reaction to Rocker boiled over in New York, his attitude has offended millions of people nationwide.</p>
        <p>The bad blood will follow the Braves for the next three months. Yesterday, Rocker went out onto the field before the eighth inning and warmed up the left fielder. When the warm-up was over, Rocker tossed the ball into the stands. The fan who caught it threw it back.</p>
        <p>You can argue that the Braves escaped once again after the Mets had them cornered. But the Mets' miracle on Friday and the pummeling on Saturday served notice that the escape routes are disappearing.</p>
        <p>Or, as Bell said yesterday, ''We've got a serious window of opportunity.''</p>
        <p>How much space separates Atlanta from the Mets? Baseball is a game of numbers, but this race is one of intangibles. A two-game lead does not begin to tell the story.</p>
