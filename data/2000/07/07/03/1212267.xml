        <p>Four husband-hunting women. Three wife-seeking men. Guess who is going to be disappointed?</p>
        <p>Maybe the audience.</p>
        <p>''The Dance on Widows' Row'' is a comic yarn about a group of North Carolina neighbors who have bad luck with husbands. Their men keep dying. The widows are glad to have the pensions, but they miss the companionship and hate the gossip that keeps their street off limits to the town's menfolk.</p>
        <p>Magnolia (Barbara Montgomery) has had enough. She invites some bachelors -- ''I did my homework. Ain't a dog in the bunch'' -- to join her and her fellow widows at her home for a romance-sparking party.</p>
        <p>Cupid shows up. So does the Grim Reaper. That makes the lusty widows sly suspects.</p>
        <p>''The Dance on Widows' Row'' is a mild farce, and it drew plenty of hoots and hollers at the performance I saw. But between each hoot and holler were anxious moments spent waiting for the next laugh. The cast seemed most anxious of all, because when they couldn't play to the audience, they didn't have much to do.</p>
        <p>The production is directed by its playwright, Samm-Art Williams, who has earned respect for plays like ''Home.'' The old-fashioned style of ''Widows' Row'' has its place, and it's good to see comic parts for older actors. But it's uncomfortable to watch mature performers make leering faces and Viagra jokes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams's production, by the New Federal Theater at the Henry Street Settlement's Harry De Jur Playhouse doesn't offer enough character to fill out its caricatures. Elizabeth Van Dyke offers the broadest and least substantial performance as Annie, the churchgoer who becomes a temptress. She and sometimes the rest of the cast seem to flaunt the production's loud, empty feel.</p>
        <p>Marie Thomas and especially Jack Landron commit to the play's comic heights, Elain Graham has moments with an entertaining bite, and Ms. Montgomery anchors the action well when the play is allowed to relax. But that's not often, because it is desperate to yuk it up and hope the audience is paying attention.</p>
        <p>Felix E. Cochren's naturalistic set, Evelyn Nelson's more extreme costumes and Shirley Prendergast's  cool lighting combine for a mixed effect that doesn't help the production.</p>
        <p>At moments, the widows of this play seem destined to discover a sort of woman-affirming unity, but those moments are unfortunately too fleeting.</p>
        <p>THE DANCE ON WIDOWS' ROW</p>
