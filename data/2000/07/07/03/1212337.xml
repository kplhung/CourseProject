        <p>Aliyyah Abdur-Rahman and Tajah Muhammad  Clara Mohammed Elementary School</p>
        <p>Like so many children across the country, Aliyyah Abdur-Rahman and Tajah Muhammad, left, hope to grow up to be professional athletes. But in addition to the typical pressures, the girls, African-Americans from devout Muslim families, wear head scarves while they practice and play.</p>
        <p>And there are games during Ramadan, a month when Muslims fast from sunrise to sundown.</p>
        <p>''We're running up and down the court and we can't drink anything,'' Tajah said. ''I love the religion. I just wish we didn't have to cover.''</p>
        <p>Aliyyah and Tajah, best friends who held hands as they chatted at the Clara Mohammed Elementary School, are as concerned about tests and college admission as their counterparts in secular schools. But they are also struggling to learn Arabic, and to win weekly plaudits for exhibiting what the school calls Islamic character.</p>
        <p>''Since we're Muslim, they don't want us to get off the straight path,'' Aliyyah explained.</p>
        <p>''We have all these earthly things to do -- like basketball practice and soccer practice,'' she continued. ''Sometimes when I get home, I'm so exhausted. We have this devil, Satan, Shaton. He whispers in my ear. He tells me just lay down, lay down.''</p>
        <p>Aliyyah wants to play in the W.N.B.A., then be a chiropractor and a lawyer -- and the first black woman president. Tajah plans to be a professional soccer player, but not before she attends Duke University. ''That's the school I have my destination focus on,'' she said. Both girls have a mix of A's and B's on their report cards and are constantly trying to improve.</p>
        <p>''I really want to go to college,'' Tajah said. ''Because my sister and my brother, I want to replace them, because they didn't do too well in school.''</p>
        <p>Aliyyah, meanwhile, is jealous of her brother's straight A's and top marks in Islamic character.</p>
        <p>''He's the one in the family who always gets the attention -- I want some of that, too,'' she said. ''My parents always say, 'Aliyyah, don't go down in your grade-point average, because it's going to hurt you in life.' They tell me every day.''</p>
