        <p>Behind the hills next to this Pygmy village in the Central African rain forest, a pipeline is to be built in a few years to carry oil to the Atlantic coast, where it will be shipped to the West.</p>
        <p>The pipeline, which the World Bank endorsed in June after heated debates, will be a huge project, costing $3.7 billion. It represents a big, risky test for the bank and for African development policies. Historically, the oil exploitation in Africa has generated ruinous corruption or long-running wars, not wealth for nations and their citizens.</p>
        <p>In this village, there are both doubts and hopes. ''I don't know where the oil is coming from and where it's going,'' said the village chief, Marc Nzie. ''I only know it will pass behind those hills. If they stay behind those hills, then it's no problem. We won't hunt there anymore. We'll go the other way.''</p>
        <p>But he said that in this village, which is without electricity, ''if the pipeline is going to pass behind those hills, they have to give us light.''</p>
        <p>Even before the World Bank voted on June 6, the pipeline drew a level of opposition in the West unusual for an African project. Human rights and environmental groups had joined forces with residents here and in neighboring Chad, the two countries the pipeline would cross.</p>
        <p>The underground pipeline is to start in southern Chad, a landlocked desert nation where oil was discovered three decades ago but where civil wars and unrest have prevented exploitation, leaving it one of the poorest countries.</p>
        <p>''We were very interested in working with Chad to find a way of exploiting these oil resources in a way which would channel these benefits for the poor and to make a difference in terms of poverty,'' said Callisto Madavo, the World Bank's vice president for sub-Saharan Africa. ''The stakes are very high. We should be able to pull this thing off. But I wasn't born yesterday. There are risks, and I wouldn't underplay them.''</p>
        <p>Before the 665-mile pipeline ends, in Kribi, it will have to cross the Sahel in Chad, the savanna and mountains of northeastern Cameroon and the virgin rain forests in the south, where the canopy of trees is broken only by loggers and Pygmy villages like this one.</p>
        <p>To reach this village near the pipeline route, a traveler has to follow a footpath that breaks off a dirt road and winds through the forest up and down muddy hills and across creeks to Mabolo, a village of 13 mud huts. On one morning, heavy rains had dissuaded the men from going into the forest to hunt. Many sat together in an open area.</p>
        <p>A knock on the chief's door found him on a bamboo bed, suffering from malaria. Mr. Nzie, in his 50's, is renowned as a healer, but he had been unable to rid himself of a persistent case of malaria. He calls it  ''Kabila,'' after President Laurent Kabila of Congo, whom the Rwandans and Ugandans, who are supporting the rebels, have been unable to oust for two years.</p>
        <p>The chief's eldest son, Louis Bitouti, 27, who was building a toy truck, said many younger Pygmies hoped to get jobs from the pipeline.</p>
        <p>''Why not?'' asked Mr. Bitouti, who like other Pygmies here uses his grandfather's name as his last name. ''I want to be rich like everyone else. If I lose my father here, how will I live?''</p>
        <p>The villagers founded Mabolo five decades ago, they said, and with about 50 inhabitants it was one of the biggest Pygmy villages in the region. Although Pygmies are traditionally nomadic hunters, the villagers have become somewhat sedentary, continuing to hunt deep in the forest but also growing cassava and yam.</p>
        <p>In this country of 14 million people, the Pygmies, the indigenous rain forest dwellers, number perhaps 100,000. They have remained without formal schooling, and few speak French, the language of the former colonial rulers.</p>
        <p>The dominant ethnic groups in Cameroon often discriminate against the Pygmies. Many Pygmies have been forced out of their home areas by logging companies and security forces, several human rights studies report, including the State Department report on human rights in Cameroon in 1999.</p>
        <p>A peaceful people, the Pygmies have, perhaps inevitably, become a focus of those opposed to the pipeline. The Pygmies may be the most vulnerable and have the most to lose.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, the World Bank will give $200 million in loans to the Chad and Cameroon governments. The amount is small, given the cost of the project, which will be borne mostly by the oil companies involved in the joint venture, Exxon Mobil, which would have 40 percent; Chevron, another American company, 25 percent; and a Malaysian company, Petronas, 35 percent.</p>
        <p>The World Bank support is far more important to the companies than its financial contribution. Many diplomats in the region say they believe that the companies would have withdrawn and that Chad would have turned to other partners, perhaps Libya, if the bank had not voted yes.</p>
        <p>In the last quarter of a century, the western African coast between Nigeria and Angola has become one of the hottest spots for oil exploration. But the Western multinational companies have come under increasing criticism for their practices, especially Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Elf Aquitaine in Gabon and the Congo Republic, whose capital is Brazzaville.</p>
        <p>''There is not one example in Africa where oil has led to development,'' said Samuel Nguiffo, secretary general of the Center for the Environment and Development, a leading environmental organization here. ''Look at Nigeria, Angola, the two Congos, Gabon. They all have an overabundance of oil, and what do they have to show for it?</p>
        <p>''We can even say that the exploitation of oil has retarded their development. What are the chances that things will be any different in Chad or Cameroon?''</p>
        <p>In an interview in the capital, Yaounde, where he was visiting officials, Mr. Madavo said he was aware of the history of oil here. He said he was also aware that Chad had a poor human rights record and that Transparency International, an organization based in Berlin that studies corruption, had ranked it the most corrupt country for two years.</p>
        <p>''It's very, very important that the World Bank, as an economic institution, not become so risk averse that it would only do the sure thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Early in June, the bank decided to proceed with the biggest project that it has been associated with in Africa. In Washington, officials at the State and Commerce Departments backed the plan. Their counterparts at the Agency for International Development and the Environmental Protection Agency, concerned about how the oil revenues would be spent and the pipeline's environmental effects, opposed it.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement with the bank, Chad agreed to a spending plan for its oil revenues, with 80 percent for education, health, social services, rural development and infrastructure; 10 percent to be kept in a trust for the future; and 5 percent earmarked for development in the oil-producing region of Doba. The last 5 percent would be discretionary.</p>
        <p>In Chad, where 80 percent of the seven million inhabitants live on less than $1 a day, the oil revenues would amount to up to half of the national budget. Oil money is widely expected to start flowing in four years and to last for 25 years, for a total of $2 billion. The government has pledged to respect its part of the bargain.</p>
        <p>''There will not be any place for predators of oil revenues,'' President Idriss Deby said in a speech after the bank had voted. ''We will make sure that every centime from oil will produce a positive effect in the life of every Chadian family.''</p>
        <p>The money that Cameroon would derive is estimated at $500 million, or 3 percent of the national budget. Concerns in this country center more on the ecological effects, because many environmental group contend that the huge oil companies have used substandard controls while exploiting oil in places like the Niger Delta in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Didier Amougou, an official at Planet Survey, a Cameroonian environmental organization, said groups like his had shifted from opposing the project to trying to ensure that it would be properly built and managed. He said his group would also try to make certain that those affected by the construction would receive fair compensation, especially the Pygmies, who are dominated by Bantus in the rain forest.</p>
        <p>''To the Pygmies, we are the white men,'' said Dieudonne Mbuel, 37, a Bantu, explaining how the Bantus had seized most of the rain forest from Pygmies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mbuel, who lives in a nearby Bantu village, Madoungou, said he had received $500 from the joint venture because the pipeline is expected to pass through his land. He expected more.</p>
        <p>''You see this mango tree?'' he asked, standing in the thick of the forest and pointing to a tree taller than the others. ''They'll have to compensate me for that.''</p>
        <p>None of the Pygmies interviewed have received any compensation, although some are eventually supposed to under the agreement.</p>
        <p>Not too far away, in Ndamayo, Jean Bikanda, a Pygmy, said he did not believe that he would ever receive any money for the pipeline. Several months ago, loggers ripped through the forest, creating a road just in front of his house. He received no compensation, he pointed out.</p>
        <p>Asked his age, Mr. Bikanda stood up in his hut and opened a nylon bag that was hanging in a corner. He took out his identity card, which most people in Cameroon have. But he was one of the few Pygmies interviewed who had one. Born in 1938, the card read, ''Profession: Chasseur.'' Hunter.</p>
        <p>The prey that Mr. Bikanda hunts -- rats, porcupines, rabbits, boars and antelopes -- fled deeper into the forest because of the loggers, he said. ''Maybe we will get work from this pipeline,'' he added. ''Maybe this will be good for Cameroon.''</p>
        <p>But his son Pierre Mbang, 34, said: ''Work is good, but the forest is our life. Work is good, but it will end.''</p>
        <p>The son was unsure what to make of the World Bank decision. ''That's where all the money in the world is kept,'' he said of the bank, reinforcing the distance between bank decisions and life on the ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Madavo, the bank vice president, who is from Zimbabwe, was hopeful. ''If it succeeds,'' he said, ''wouldn't that be wonderful for a story to be written 20 years from now, that on an issue where there was a lot of doubt and skepticism, that the World Bank stood up, did its homework, supported something that made a tremendous difference to Africa? I would love to be alive to see that.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 15, 2000, Saturday  A picture caption on Monday about an oil pipeline that is to run from Chad through Cameroon to the Atlantic Ocean referred incorrectly to construction in a Pygmy village. The road shown was cut by a logging company; construction of the pipeline has not begun.</p>
