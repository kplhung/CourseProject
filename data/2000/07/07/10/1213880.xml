        <p>Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet craze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration: why not try to export the revolution by taking his company's software for mobile wireless devices to the United States?</p>
        <p>So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a trans-Atlantic wireless contender. ''I had no doubt this thing will explode in America,'' said Mr. Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San Francisco. ''The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the Internet, PC's, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why shouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these things?''</p>

        <p>Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet craze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration: why not try to export the revolution by taking his company's software for mobile wireless devices to the United States?</p>
        <p>So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a trans-Atlantic wireless contender. ''I had no doubt this thing will explode in America,'' said Mr. Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San Francisco. ''The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the Internet, PC's, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why shouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these things?''</p>
        <p>It is far too early to handicap the chances for OZ, which recently received a large equity investment from Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications company. OZ is but one of many hopefuls in a free-for-all involving dozens of other start-ups and large telecommunications companies to develop and promote access to the Internet. And like the migrating Mr. Mogensen, the wireless Internet craze is coming to the United States from overseas -- primarily Europe and Asia, where for various reasons the trend took hold first.</p>
        <p>The wireless Internet, which provides Web access on devices like pagers, cell phones and Palm hand-held devices, is being promoted as the most promising technological development since the Internet itself started taking off in the early 1990's. In two or three years, there are expected to be almost as many wireless Internet users worldwide as people accessing the Web on wired PC's. But given the current state of play in the industry -- and some distinct technical shortcomings -- can the wireless Web live up to its billing?</p>
        <p>The answer may depend on the ability of companies to wade through a morass of competing technical standards in their efforts to make wireless Web access faster and more convenient. And at least in the early going, American consumers will find that wireless Web surfing is a slow, bare-bones experience bearing scant resemblance to the hard-wired version.</p>
        <p>''We're in the euphoria phase right now, where the future seems very bright,'' said Jane Zweig, executive vice president of Herschel Shostek Associates, a wireless research firm. ''But pretty soon we'll get to the pain phase, when the complications of the wireless Internet will become apparent. Then it'll take a while to get to the pleasure and perfection phases.''</p>
        <p>Consumers in this country can already glimpse the wireless Internet's potential through applications that enable them to get stock quotes, check the weather or send short text messages over their mobile phones or other devices. And judging from experiences in Europe and Asia, Americans have only started to scratch the surface.</p>
        <p>In Japan, teenagers download still cartoons on services provided by NTT DoCoMo, the country's leading wireless company, whose mobile Internet customers account for 30 percent of Japanese Web users. In Italy, daily horoscopes are the rage. In Finland and Sweden, one of the hottest applications is a mobile banking service allowing people to conduct nearly every banking transaction except withdrawing cash.</p>
        <p>Global growth estimates for the mobile Internet can be heady.</p>
        <p>According to the ARC Group, a London consulting firm, about 100 million of the world's 500 million mobile phones in use by year-end will be capable of Internet access. Within three years, ARC says, an estimated 300 million of 900 million wireless phones will be Internet-ready. Other industry forecasts say that in five years, as many as 500 million people worldwide -- one of every dozen -- will have phones or other devices capable of wireless Internet access.</p>
        <p>Whether those projections are close to attainable will depend largely on efforts now under way to increase the speed of wireless Internet connections. For now, the fastest wireless speeds range from 9,600 to 14,400 bits a second, much slower than the Internet connections of up to 56,000 bits a  second available to people using dial-up modems on their home computers. (And, of course, other kinds of wired connections, like cable modems or high-speed lines are much faster still.)</p>
        <p>Today's wireless speed limits mean that most wireless users in the United States can do little more than send or receive a few lines of Internet text through cell phones -- maybe reading a brief news alert about the latest interest-rate decision by the Federal Reserve, or sending a short e-mail message over a Yahoo or Hotmail account.</p>
        <p>Yet, nearly everyone in the wireless industry agrees that by next year speeds approaching that of a typical home PC connection will be available through wireless devices, allowing sophisticated applications like the downloading of images.</p>
        <p>''Speed is a temporary problem,'' said John Garcia, senior vice president for sales and distribution at Sprint PCS, one of the nation's largest wireless operators, which is busily adding Internet access to cities throughout its network.</p>
        <p>One reason wireless technology does not yet allow for more sophisticated Internet applications is that companies in different parts of the world have adopted different technological standards, instead of rallying around a single standard that might ease development of a common mass market for wireless Internet access.</p>
        <p>Europe, for the most part, has adhered to a digital technology known as G.S.M., which stands for global system for mobile communications. In Asia, a mixture of standards is in use, with C.D.M.A., which stands for code division multiple access, dominant in Japan and South Korea, while G.S.M. is sporadically used elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But it is in the United States where standards have been most fragmented, helping explain why the wireless Internet has been slower to catch on here. AT&amp;T uses a format called T.D.M.A., or time division multiple access. Because T.D.M.A. does not support data transmission, AT&amp;T has been forced to overlay an older format to provide Internet access through its cell phones, adding further complexity to its current generation of handsets. Meanwhile, other American carriers like Sprint and Verizon have adopted C.D.M.A. And still others, including VoiceStream Wireless and Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications, use European-style G.S.M.</p>
        <p>Unless special measures are taken to enable a phone to use several of these formats, a device designed to work with one wireless technology cannot be used on a network that employs another technology.</p>
        <p>Most creators of wireless Internet applications have compensated for this technical Tower of Babel by agreeing to a format called WAP -- for wireless access protocol -- which works with any of the various cellular transmission formats. Any WAP-enabled cell phone, used with any flavor of cellular network, can use the same WAP application -- a wireless restaurant locator, for example, a stock-quote system or some wireless Internet offering. (The iMode technology used by NTT DoCoMo in Japan is not WAP compatible.)</p>
        <p>Taken together, the disparate carrier standards are known as the second-generation of wireless technology -- the first generation having been the nondigital analog technology that the original cellular industry rolled out in the 1980's. Over the next two to five years, the global wireless industry expects to move to a so-called second-and-a-half digital generation, followed by a third generation. The differences can be arcane, but the coming generations of formats are meant to allow for much higher data speeds -- and to be compatible with one another.</p>
        <p>Whether WAP continues through these next generations, or is replaced by a new format for programmers who write the application software, the next generations of wireless technology should make it easier to roam from one continent to another with a single hand-held Internet access device. And the ability to send larger amounts of data may make the wireless Internet an option for businesses and individuals.</p>
        <p>''Sooner than you think, we'll be able to do videoconferencing with wireless access,'' said Anil Khatod, president of global Internet solutions at Nortel Networks, the maker of network equipment.</p>
        <p>Along with Nortel, companies like Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent and Nokia are competing for tens of billions of dollars of contracts to build new generations of wireless networks. Last year, the value of wireless infrastructure contracts worldwide reached $28.7 billion, a 22 percent increase from 1998, according to the Cahners In-Stat Group, a research firm. Some of those companies, along with others like Palm, Research in Motion and the Swatch Group, are  developing new types of devices for sending and getting wireless data and images.</p>
        <p>''We are coming up with things that will make your head spin,'' said Lawrence Rabiner, vice president for research at AT&amp;T Labs. One of AT&amp;T's projects under development is a pair of Internet-accessible ski goggles with a built-in wireless phone that would allow skiers to hold conversations, transmit a video of their downhill descent or pull down a course map projected onto a visor. ''It's James Bond, 'Mission Impossible' stuff,'' Mr. Rabiner said.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are big questions about how many new mobile Internet services people really want -- and how practical it will be to provide or to use the most exotic applications.</p>
        <p>''Obviously the whole wireless Internet nirvana hype sells a lot of papers,'' said Mark F. Bregman, who as head of pervasive computing at I.B.M. is working on third-generation and even fourth-generation wireless technology. ''We need to realize that the wireless Internet is not a panacea, that some things like doing video on a cell phone would be impractical because video hogs so much bandwidth.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are concerns about the amount of available radio-wave spectrum that can be used to transmit wireless data. And some industry executives worry quietly about whether some consumers might get turned off at this early, homely stage in the industry's development.</p>
        <p>But despite such qualms, many new participants are entering the wireless fray -- including Brad A. Silverberg, a former high-ranking Microsoft executive who led the company's Windows business. In March, Mr. Silverberg and former executives from McCaw Cellular formed the ignition Corporation, an investment firm focused entirely on wireless Internet ventures.</p>
        <p>''This is a huge wager we're making, but my instinct tells me the wireless Internet is the next tech tidal wave, like the PC and the Internet itself,'' Mr. Silverberg said. ''Will we win the bet? If you judge our chances by the number of people and amount of resources committed to this thing, I'd say they are very good.''</p>
