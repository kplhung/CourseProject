        <p>Is there anything more important in the world of interior design than the new popularity of the $10,000 AGA 59-inch radiant-surface cooker stove? Any story more pressing than the sad decline of chintz? What about the befuddling hegemony of Restoration Hardware chic?</p>

        <p>Is there anything more important in the world of interior design than the new popularity of the $10,000 AGA 59-inch radiant-surface cooker stove? Any story more pressing than the sad decline of chintz? What about the befuddling hegemony of Restoration Hardware chic?</p>
        <p>The only thing that could eclipse such decorating puzzlements is having the top editor of one home-design magazine jump ship for another. Marian McEvoy, the editor in chief of Elle Decor, published by the Hachette Filipacchi Magazines unit of Lagardere, resigned on Thursday to take over House Beautiful, a 104-year-old publication owned by Hearst Magazines.</p>
        <p>Louis Oliver Gropp, House Beautiful's longtime editor in chief, who favored features on traditional decorating styles, announced his retirement in May. Ms. McEvoy made her mark at Elle Decor by featuring stories on a starker aesthetic.</p>
        <p>The challenge for Ms. McEvoy will be to reconcile her more eclectic sensibility -- she has used a glue gun to cover entire rooms of her apartment with seashells, for instance -- with the expectations of House Beautiful's 876,262 readers.</p>
        <p>Her appointment could significantly weaken Elle Decor, which has 441,122 readers, and no clear candidate in mind to replace her.</p>
        <p>It will also affect House &amp; Garden, the other large home-design magazine. Published by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, House &amp; Garden has a circulation of 770,325, but newsstand sales dipped 18.7 percent the last six months of 1999, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>Ms. McEvoy said she had not made any editorial decisions yet. ''It is certainly a big challenge to have more readers,'' she said. ''You have to be clever about addressing the needs of more readers. And we love cleverness. We've got lots of cleverness.''</p>
