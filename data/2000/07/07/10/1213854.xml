        <p>First, synergy. Now, miniature bath soap.</p>
        <p>When Talk magazine was introduced a year ago, the editor in chief, Tina Brown, discussed the potential for cooperative efforts with Miramax Films, which owns half of the Talk Media venture.</p>
        <p>The Miramax relationship came up again in a letter from Talk Media's president, Ronald A. Galotti, to what is known at Talk as ''Tina's hot list'' -- a few hundred people who, apart from those in the news media, include demicelebrities and so-called A-list people who can usually be depended upon to talk about the magazine on the party circuit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galotti's letter last week asserted that ''a magazine of Talk's caliber can only come together through valuable partnerships'' and pointed out how, for example, Talk has ''embraced its multimedia partnership with Miramax Films.''</p>
        <p>And as of August, Mr. Galotti's letter went on, Talk magazine will have a yet another corporate ''association.'' This one is not with a company that is an owner of the magazine, nor is it even with a media company; it is with Bacara, a resort hotel in California that is not yet open. Mr. Galotti's letter was accompanied by a pamphlet promoting the creature comforts of the resort. (''In-room spa services. Bathrobes and slippers. Luxurious bathroom amenities.'')</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for magazine publishers to alert select readers that a new advertiser has bought pages in the magazine. But it is rare for the publisher to compare the new advertiser to one of its owners in terms of importance. In this instance, a hotel does not offer the synergistic opportunities for film-making, screenwriting or developing young talent that Miramax, a unit of Walt Disney,  does.</p>
        <p>Staff members at Talk say that Bacara, as an incentive to advertise, was offered the sweetener that the publisher would promote the hotel to a select group of Hollywood heavyweights. And Bacara accepted, buying the first two pages of advertising in Talk's August issue.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Talk needs ad pages. According to an independent count (Talk's ad pages are not yet monitored by the Publishing Information Bureau), it started with 126.3 ad pages in its first issue last September but dipped to 48.6 pages in February, 70.8 in April, 41.3 in March and 36.1 in the June/July issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galotti was unavailable for comment. Hilary Bass, a spokeswoman for Talk, said that the relationship with Bacara should not be construed as a corporate partnership -- even if Mr. Galotti had compared it in depth and importance to the magazine's tie to Miramax.</p>
        <p>''The new association is standard procedure,'' Ms. Bass said. ''This is just to show that they are a new advertiser in the magazine and we hope to do more business with them.''</p>

        <p>Correction:  August 1, 2000, Tuesday  A report in the Media Talk column of Business Day on July 10 about an incentive offered by Talk magazine  to attract advertising from Bacara, a resort hotel in California, referred incorrectly to monitoring of Talk's advertising pages by the Publishers Information Bureau. The bureau indeed monitors Talk, and its figures differ from independent estimates by an industry executive that were used in the article. In February, the bureau counted 138.4 advertising pages, compared with 48.6 for the independent count, although the larger figure included a special advertising section. In March, it counted 48.8 pages, compared with 41.3; in April, 70.3 pages, compared with 70.8; and in June 36.2 pages, compared with 36.1.</p>
