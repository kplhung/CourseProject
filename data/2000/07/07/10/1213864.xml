        <p>The team that produced ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' one of the most successful comedy series ever imported from England, has created another series that will have its premiere on the BBC early next year before it eventually makes its way to two cable channels in the United States, BBC America and Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>The show, ''Mirrorball,'' will star Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, the two women who also starred in ''Ab-Fab,'' as the previous hit series came to be called. Ms. Saunders, who wrote the original, will again write this series, which will focus on theatrical characters involved in London's West End musicals.</p>

        <p>The team that produced ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' one of the most successful comedy series ever imported from England, has created another series that will have its premiere on the BBC early next year before it eventually makes its way to two cable channels in the United States, BBC America and Comedy Central.</p>
        <p>The show, ''Mirrorball,'' will star Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley, the two women who also starred in ''Ab-Fab,'' as the previous hit series came to be called. Ms. Saunders, who wrote the original, will again write this series, which will focus on theatrical characters involved in London's West End musicals.</p>
        <p>The two actresses will play new characters, one a former dancer, the other a former disco diva, both past their primes but still game. Paul Lee, the chief operating officer of BBC America, described the show as ''irreverent, indecent and completely inebriated,'' three adjectives that were often attached to the previous series.</p>
        <p>Most of the rest of the supporting cast from ''Absolutely Fabulous'' will also reappear as new characters, including Julia Sawalha, June Whitfield and Jane Horrocks. Ms. Horrocks, who also starred in the stage and movie versions of ''Little Voice,'' will play an Icelandic waitress-singer in the new series.</p>
        <p>The deal to bring ''Mirrorball'' to the United States involves both BBC America and Comedy Central because BBC America, which is seeking to expand its distribution on American cable systems, will carry the pilot while Comedy Central, which built ''Absolutely Fabulous'' into a significant cable hit, will then gain rights to the rest of the series. The number of episodes has not been determined.</p>
