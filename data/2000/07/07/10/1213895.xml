        <p>Pope John Paul II expressed ''bitterness'' today about a gay pride festival held in Rome during this Roman Catholic Holy Year, saying that the event, which ends today, was an affront to the church and the ''Christian values'' of the Italian capital.</p>
        <p>''In the name of the church of Rome, I cannot not express bitterness for the affront to the Grand Jubilee of the year 2000 and for the offense to the Christian values of a city that is so dear to the hearts of Catholics across the world,'' the pope said in a Sunday message delivered from a balcony over St. Peter's Square.</p>

        <p>Pope John Paul II expressed ''bitterness'' today about a gay pride festival held in Rome during this Roman Catholic Holy Year, saying that the event, which ends today, was an affront to the church and the ''Christian values'' of the Italian capital.</p>
        <p>''In the name of the church of Rome, I cannot not express bitterness for the affront to the Grand Jubilee of the year 2000 and for the offense to the Christian values of a city that is so dear to the hearts of Catholics across the world,'' the pope said in a Sunday message delivered from a balcony over St. Peter's Square.</p>
        <p>For months, church officials lobbied to cancel the festival, but today was the first time the pope personally addressed the issue. That he did so even after the most contested part of the program, Saturday's gay pride parade, was over was a sign of how strongly he feels about an issue that still divides many Catholics.</p>
        <p>So was the fact that he spoke out right after holding a special Jubilee Mass for inmates at a Rome prison, effectively eclipsing the appeal he made there for governments around the world to reduce sentences for prisoners during the Holy Year.</p>
        <p>''The church cannot silence the truth,'' the pope said in his message. ''because it would not live up to its faith in God the creator and would not help discern what is good from what is evil.''</p>
        <p>He then reminded his audience of church teaching on homosexuality, stating that ''homosexual acts go against natural law.'' Citing the Catholic catechism, John Paul said, ''This inclination, objectively disordered, is for most of them a trial.'' He added that gays should be accepted with ''respect, compassion, and sensitivity.''</p>
        <p>''Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The pope's remarks instantly caused anger and indignation at Capocotta, a nude beach near Rome, where the gay festival, World Pride, was holding a final beach party after a week of conferences, fashion shows and concerts. ''The pope is wrong to condemn World Pride,'' said Franco Grillini, the honorary president of Arcigay, an Italian gay rights organization. ''The real offense is homophobia and antigay prejudice fueled by the Vatican hierarchy.''</p>
        <p>The Vatican's lobbying against the festival led to a fierce political battle between Italy's governing center-left coalition and the center-right opposition, which joined the Vatican in opposing the timing and aims of the World Pride festival.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the pope's appeal to governments to reduce prison sentences and improve conditions as a symbol of mercy had strong political repercussions in Italy. The Italian government is considering a general pardon or amnesty to ease conditions in the country's badly crowded prisons. But the center-right contends that a pardon could put dangerous criminals back on the streets.</p>
        <p>The pope's appeal has raised expectations in prisons, where inmates -- and prison guards -- all over Italy have held demonstrations. And it has put pressure on politicians, who have to weigh the pope's moral authority and popularity against public opinion polls, which suggest that most Italians oppose a general pardon.</p>
        <p>''Each of you lives for the day in which, your sentence served, you can regain your liberty,'' the pope told 74 prisoners seated near him today in the rotunda of Regina Coeli, or Queen of Heaven, a prison for men on the Tiber River. Hundreds of other prisoners sat in corridors off the room, listening. ''I have invoked for you a sign of clemency.''</p>
