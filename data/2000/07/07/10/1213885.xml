        <p>PeopleSoft to Introduce Latest Version of Program  PeopleSoft plans to introduce on Tuesday the latest version of its ''enterprise software,'' a huge and complex program that companies use to automate dozens of tasks. The key to the newest version is that it will be Internet-based, meaning employees and customers can use the program with a Web browser instead of tapping into an internal software program.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high for PeopleSoft. Its software release is months behind those of its competitors, Oracle and SAP. Plus, PeopleSoft is coming off a disappointing year of flat revenue and a falling stock price. [Page C2.]</p>

        <p>PeopleSoft to Introduce Latest Version of Program  PeopleSoft plans to introduce on Tuesday the latest version of its ''enterprise software,'' a huge and complex program that companies use to automate dozens of tasks. The key to the newest version is that it will be Internet-based, meaning employees and customers can use the program with a Web browser instead of tapping into an internal software program.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high for PeopleSoft. Its software release is months behind those of its competitors, Oracle and SAP. Plus, PeopleSoft is coming off a disappointing year of flat revenue and a falling stock price. [Page C2.]</p>
        <p>A New Career for Helen Thomas  Less than two months after resigning from United Press International, the news service where she had spent her career, including four decades at the White House, Helen Thomas, 79, joined Hearst Newspapers last week to write columns on the White House and national affairs. She will write two columns, each appearing weekly, for a company whose papers include The Houston Chronicle, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The San Francisco Examiner. [C14.]</p>
        <p>'Harry Potter' Book Sets Records  ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the latest book in author J. K. Rowling's popular series about the exploits of a boy wizard, set records in its first weekend of sales, leaving many bookstores already out of stock. [E6.]</p>
        <p>The book is exactly the big, clever, vibrant, tremendously assured installment that gives shape and direction to the whole undertaking and still somehow preserves the material's enchanting innocence. Review. [E1.]</p>
        <p>Daimler May Rent Chrysler Space  DaimlerChrysler said that it was considering leasing space in the landmark Chrysler Building, which could help the company in its attempts to lure Wall Street investors. [A1.]</p>
        <p>'Big Brother' Ratings Slide Further  After a weekend of sharply declining ratings, CBS's ''Big Brother,'' the latest effort in the reality television trend, is falling far short of the phenomenon status reached by two other European imports, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's ''Survivor.'' [C10.]</p>
        <p>'Ab-Fab' Team Has a New Series  The team that produced ''Absolutely Fabulous,'' one of the most successful comedy series imported from England, has created another series -- featuring the same stars as different characters -- that will have its premiere on the BBC early next year before it eventually makes its way to two cable channels in the United States. [C10.]</p>
        <p>A New Kind of Synergy for Talk  Ronald A. Galotti, the publisher of Talk magazine, sent a letter to a few hundred people who can usually be depended upon to talk about the magazine on the party circuit asserting that ''a magazine of Talk's caliber can only come together through valuable partnerships'' like its cooperation with Miramax Films, which owns half of the Talk Media venture. Another important partner, the letter said, is Bacara, a resort hotel in California that bought the first two pages of advertising in the August issue. It is not unusual for publishers to alert select readers that a new advertiser has bought pages. But it is rare for the publisher to compare the new advertiser to one of its owners in terms of importance. [C14.]</p>
        <p>Heinz Hopes Children Like Green  In a move to raise sales of its ketchup, H.J. Heinz plans to introduce a version today that will be green and is intended to appeal to children. Heinz has also come up with a bottle it says is easier for children to squeeze. [C2.]</p>
