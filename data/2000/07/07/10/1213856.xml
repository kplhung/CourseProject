        <p>Four decades in the White House covering the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the humiliations of Richard M. Nixon and the indiscretions of Bill Clinton, did not leave Helen Thomas feeling disillusioned, jaded or in need of rest. It left her longing to return.</p>

        <p>Four decades in the White House covering the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the humiliations of Richard M. Nixon and the indiscretions of Bill Clinton, did not leave Helen Thomas feeling disillusioned, jaded or in need of rest. It left her longing to return.</p>
        <p>''I hope to be there every day,'' said Ms. Thomas, the unofficial doyenne of the White House press corps. ''I sort of consider it almost a second office.''</p>
        <p>Less than two months after resigning from United Press International, the wire service where she had spent her career, the 79-year-old journalist joined Hearst Newspapers last week to write columns on the White House and other national affairs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas worked at U.P.I. for 57 years, surmounting discrimination against women in the newsroom to become the organization's most famous correspondent. But she quit in May, the day after a company controlled by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church, bought the wire service. ''It was a bridge too far,'' Ms. Thomas recalled last week.</p>
        <p>After her abrupt departure, she had doubts about working again. Not that she wanted to retire. At her age, she simply thought it might be hard to find a job. ''I was amazed,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''I had no idea I would have so many nice offers.''</p>
        <p>She will write two columns, each appearing weekly, for a company whose papers include The Houston Chronicle, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The San Francisco Examiner. One of her columns will recount the many political anecdotes she has amassed. The other will tackle the issues of the day: families without health insurance, children in poverty, guns and violence.</p>
        <p>''Outrage, that's my adrenaline,'' she said. ''People should be reminded of the injustices around them.''</p>
