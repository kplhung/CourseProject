        <p>Re ''As Summer School Opens, Complaints on Promotions Persist'' (news article, July 5):</p>
        <p>The debate over social promotion and grade retention is nothing new. The education community has been wrestling with the issue since the 1970's. As long as the debate continues, there will not be lasting improvement, and children's future opportunities will be severely limited.</p>
        <p>Mandating summer school gives students five extra weeks of instruction, but as the superintendent of District 29 in Queens, Michael Johnson, points out, ''You cannot do an entire year in that short period of time.'' Offering students and teachers the resources they need during the school year, providing professional development for teachers and offering intensive afterschool programs give students the help they need long before testing in the spring.</p>
