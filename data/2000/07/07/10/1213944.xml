        <p>Re ''The Minority Quarterback: Coaches Chose a White to Call the Plays. The Campus Found That Hard to Swallow'' (''How Race Is Lived in America,'' front page, July 2):</p>
        <p>Your article looked at race in a way that is not common in our society -- with a white person representing the minority. Although Marcus Jacoby, the quarterback, transferred to another college, leaving the tensions and fears of a minority student behind, those who are minorities in American society do not have this luxury. People of color cannot escape from the daily pain, threats and violence.</p>

        <p>In many respects, America is a great nation. But race is perhaps the most visible and invisible chasm dividing our society and inhibiting the progress of our businesses, schools and the nation as a whole. The cycle of hate, mistrust and fear fostered during centuries of inequality must be brought to a halt.</p>
