        <p>The Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan was an icon to the automobile age when it opened in 1930, with stylized hubcaps and racing cars on setbacks, hood-ornament gargoyles and, over parabolas that suggested the spokes of wheels, a stainless steel spire thrusting skyward like profits.</p>
        <p>Seventy years later, in an age of multinational corporations and virtual reality, Walter B. Chrysler's glorious 77-story Art Deco tower may again become a powerful symbol for a new generation of automakers whose fortunes are as dependent upon images and Wall Street as engines and the open road.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler A.G., one of the world's largest companies, with revenues of more than $150 billion and principal offices in the relatively provincial towns of Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Mich., said yesterday that it hoped to rent space in the Chrysler Building as a ''virtual headquarters'' -- a meeting place for its board and a center for its investor and public relations staffs.</p>
        <p>For DaimlerChrysler -- whose stock has plummeted since Daimler-Benz swallowed the Chrysler Corporation in November 1998 -- the upper reaches of the landmark tower at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue would provide luxury space for only a few movers and shakers, perhaps 100 of its hundreds of thousands of employees.</p>
        <p>But it would reaffirm the American roots of a company that has been viewed increasingly by investors as a European behemoth with global aspirations reflecting those of its jet-set chairman, Juergens Schrempp, and would put its key image makers squarely in the media and financial capital of the world.</p>
        <p>''It's a good opportunity if we can move to the Chrysler Building,'' Michael Pfister, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, said by telephone from Stuttgart.</p>
        <p>Confirming a report in The Detroit News &amp; Free Press yesterday, Mr. Pfister said that DaimlerChrysler's investor and public relations departments would be moved from Auburn Hills to New York, and that the company hoped to get space in the Chrysler Building for those staffs and for meetings of the 13-member board of managers, which meets twice a month in the Seagram Building, on Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pfister said the deal was not yet set and declined to discuss details of reported negotiations with Tishman Speyer Properties, a principal owner of the Chrysler Building. Efforts to reach officials of Tishman Speyer yesterday were unavailing.</p>
        <p>But The News &amp; Free Press reported that DaimlerChrysler said that a proposed lease called for rent of $100 a square foot for the top five floors under the stainless steel pinnacle, about twice the going rate for midtown space.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler would also put up $5 million for renovations, including a restoration of the Cloud Club, where Mr. Chrysler and other moguls wined and dined in marble-and-bronze splendor with sweeping views of the city.</p>
        <p>When it opened on May 28, 1930, the Chrysler Building -- William Van Alen's architectural masterpiece -- was briefly the world's tallest structure: a 1,046-foot skyscraper that topped the Woolworth Building and the Eiffel Tower, but was itself topped by the Empire State Building in 1931.</p>
        <p>It had a lobby of red Moroccan marble, elevator doors inlaid with Japanese ash and American walnut, and a ceiling mural 110 feet long and 76 feet wide by Edward Trumbull, whose theme was industrial and transportation progress. (The mural was restored last year, and work to restore the Cloud Club from decades of neglect, water and vandalism has been underway for about a year.)</p>
        <p>Over the years, the building, an embodiment of the romantic skyscraper, became part of the historical fabric of the city. Margaret Bourke-White, the pioneering photojournalist, was an early tenant, with a studio and office on the 61st floor.</p>
        <p>On evenings and weekends, she was often the building's only occupant, taking her breathtaking pictures of the city (and having herself photographed out on the gargoyles).</p>
        <p>In 1934, James Agee, the writer, was said to have dangled by his hands from the 50th-floor offices of Fortune magazine, where he worked, apparently for the thrill of it.</p>
        <p>In ''James Agee: A Life,'' Laurence Bergreen quotes a colleague as saying he walked into Agee's office one day and was astonished to see his ''hands clinging to the outside windowsill,'' contemplating pedestrians below. Later, inside, he explained that the experience made his blood ''thicker.''</p>
        <p>Walter P. Chrysler, the company's founder, who insisted upon the automotive iconography in the architectural plans of the building, occupied a suite of offices at the top, and had a lavish private dining room ringed with a frieze of auto workers in polished black glass on a field of frosted blue.</p>
        <p>But unlike Alfred P. Sloan Jr., the president and chairman of General Motors, who ran his company for decades out of New York even though the headquarters was in Detroit, Mr. Chrysler did not establish a corporate headquarters in his building, choosing instead to rent out its offices and keep Chrysler's offices in Michigan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chrysler died in 1940, and some sections of the building that bore his name fell gradually into disrepair in succeeding decades, even as its facade was designated a New York City landmark in 1978. In 1997, Tishman Speyer and the Travelers Group bought the building for $225 million.</p>
        <p>In November 1998, Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation merged in what was described by the companies at the time as a partnership of equals. But it is now clear that the deal was a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler, with most of the American managers gone and German managers dominant.</p>
        <p>Since the takeover, DaimlerChrysler has expanded its reach, acquiring large stakes in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Company, signaling its intent to be a major player on the global stage. It is already one of the world's largest companies in terms of revenue.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, DaimlerChrysler's stock has lost about half its value since the takeover -- it closed at 54 1/8 on Friday -- and the reasons for the decline, according to business and financial experts, have much to do with public and investor images in the age of borderless multinational corporations.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's did not include the merged corporation in its list of 500 top American companies, on the grounds that it was a German company.</p>
        <p>One result of that decision was that many American investors, who made up half of the shareholders of the merged company in 1998, have sold the stock, and Americans now make up only about one fourth of the shareholders.</p>
        <p>One way to improve the stock price would be to cut costs and raise profits. A German newspaper, Stuttgarter Nachrichten, reported on Saturday that the company hoped to cut administrative costs at its Stuttgart and Auburn Hills headquarters by 25 percent. Mr. Pfister, the spokesman, confirmed that it was looking for ways to cut costs, but said that no decisions had been made.</p>
        <p>Another way to improve the stock price might be to win back American investors. Mr. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, is said to be acutely aware of the advantages of a company presence in New York City, near Wall Street and the headquarters of the major American media, in pursuing such a strategy.</p>
        <p>While DaimlerChrysler's board has met regularly in New York, and some key employees have had offices here, Mr. Schrempp is said to believe that a move to the Chrysler Building, even by a few key operatives, could represent a powerful signal that a company with global ambitions was ready to play in New York.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 17, 2000, Monday  An article last Monday about DaimlerChrysler's plan to rent space in the Chrysler Building misspelled the given name of the company's chairman. He is Jurgen E. Schrempp, not Juergens.</p>
