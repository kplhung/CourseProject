      <abstract>
        <p>Julie E Dunn letter says that if J K Rowling's latest opus can dissuade people of any age from being intimidated by lengthy book, she will be doing reading public her best service yet (July 7 Gail Collins Op-Ed column)</p>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I wish that Gail Collins would refrain from judging a book by its quantity rather than by its quality (''Moby Dick on a Broom,'' column, July 7). If J. K. Rowling's latest opus, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' can dissuade people of any age from being intimidated by books longer than 400 pages, she will be doing the reading public her best service yet.</p>
        <p>When I was in high school, several English classes were assigned John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath,'' and even at the age of 15 I was disgruntled by the number of my fellow students whose only comment was to whine that it was too long.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, there was at least one other person whose reaction to it mirrored mine. ''Too long?'' he exclaimed. ''I only wish there had been more!''</p>
        <p>I can't say that was the only reason that I married him 15 years later, but it sure didn't hurt!</p>
