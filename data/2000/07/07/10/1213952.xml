        <p>Someone looking for a model of how to integrate poor Hispanic immigrants into a prosperous suburban community would probably not start in this Westchester County town, where years of legal battles have pitted unwelcome newcomers against local officials.</p>
        <p>But largely because of that history of discord, Mount Kisco is now home to an ambitious new program that seeks to do something few local suburbs have accomplished -- to ford the river of race, class and ethnicity and make the immigrants feel they are accepted and valued in a largely affluent suburb.</p>
        <p>The Buddies Program, as it is known, faces numerous obstacles in a town where immigrants stand on the street by the train station looking for yard work as suburban women glide by in their S.U.V.'s. First among them is that Westchester County, outside its most diverse communities like Mount Vernon, Ossining or Yonkers, is a place where people seem more accustomed to saying ''buenos dias'' during a Costa Rican vacation than to neighbors in their own towns.</p>
        <p>Still, the program's organizer, Carla Rediker, a social worker at Mount Kisco Elementary School, has so far rounded up almost 50 immigrant parents and half as many local residents who want to work with them.</p>
        <p>''We believe that cultural change occurs as one person after another does the right thing,'' Ms. Rediker said. ''Then we can begin healing the highly publicized racial tensions here.''</p>
        <p>So with mimeographed fliers in the windows of Mount Kisco's Hispanic restaurants and coin laundries, she has lured cautious immigrants to twice-weekly classes that combine English as a second language with life skills. And she has begun pairing them with American families who can guide and befriend them as they settle in this new and often hostile land.</p>
        <p>The chasm is particularly deep here. Mount Kisco has weathered at least four lawsuits on behalf of its immigrants. Three were class actions alleging discriminatory raids on overcrowded housing and gathering places where day laborers wait for work. Those cases ended in out-of-court settlements favorable to the immigrants. The fourth was a case involving the eviction of a restaurant owner who changed her Chinese cuisine to attract a Hispanic clientele. A federal judge stayed the eviction in language that scathingly condemned the town.</p>
        <p>In this atmosphere, the Buddies Program is trying to build bridges on individual levels, and Lenore Linares and Evelin Diaz are at the leading edge of the experiment. They came together, first in a classroom at Mount  Kisco Elementary School, the most heavily Hispanic in the district with 4 in 10 children from Spanish-speaking homes, and later in each other's homes. They have known each other only a few months but are already discovering cross-cultural understanding.</p>
        <p>Ms. Linares, a school aide, wife of an electrical engineer and mother of two children, has learned that she was once too judgmental of the Hispanic parents who pull their children out of school to shuttle them between here and their home country. She softened her position after hearing Ms. Diaz's tortured story of migration from the Dominican Republic, leaving her children behind.</p>
        <p>Ms. Diaz, separated from her husband and recently reunited with the youngest of her three children, has learned from Ms. Linares that there is kindness here, even in the big houses far from the neighborhood along the railroad tracks where most of the immigrants live. Until the Buddies Program began, her only social contacts, despite her eight years in Mount Kisco and near-fluent English, were her Spanish-speaking co-workers at T.J. Maxx and her Ecuadorean boyfriend.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rediker's goal, after a year of  counseling immigrant children, is to give their parents a toehold ''in this country, this community and this school district.'' At the same time, she hopes to encourage their American counterparts to acquaint themselves with Hispanic culture and language and thus view the newcomers as an asset rather than an eyesore.</p>
        <p>It is likely to be an uphill battle.</p>
        <p>Hostility, especially toward the Central American day laborers who have flooded downtown Mount Kisco, is less public than it once was but still corrosive. A planned recreation center for the laborers was recently jettisoned because of antagonistic neighbors. And a school budget went down on the first of two votes, in part because of the burden of educating non-English-speaking children.</p>
        <p>Even the Buddies Program, despite its enthusiastic participants,  has its limitations. Four months after its inception, most of the English-speaking buddies are themselves the children of immigrants, raised in two languages and two cultures.</p>
        <p>Ms. Linares's mother, for instance, was born in the Canary Islands and taught her daughter Spanish before teaching her English. Maureen Morrisey, another participant, who lives in Chappaqua and teaches school in Pelham, is half Colombian. Dr. Amy Solerno, a physician at Northern Westchester Hospital here, who is organizing health screening for members of the program, has an Italian father, an Argentine mother and a toddler whose first language is Spanish.</p>
        <p>Each of these women hopes to be an emissary in the community, to draw in others without firsthand experience of being a stranger in a strange land. And one of Ms. Rediker's plans for the coming months is to start a class that will teach Spanish to Mount Kisco residents, thus opening the door of understanding a crack wider.</p>
        <p>The teachers, she said, will be her current Hispanic students. ''Those of you who understand English, even if you can't speak it, can teach Spanish to Anglos,'' she said at a recent class. Virtually everyone in the room understood and nodded proudly.</p>
        <p>The three-hour classes for Hispanics have included a series of guest speakers, including immigration lawyers, housing experts and town officials. Recently, Ms. Rediker escorted the group to a school budget hearing, even though most are not citizens and thus cannot vote.</p>
        <p>''I wanted them to be seen as a physical presence,'' she said. ''They filled a third of the auditorium and that sent a message to the board that they must represent all the children in the district.''</p>
        <p>The classes are homey. At first, Ms. Rediker cooked dinner; now local restaurants provide the food. The hallways buzz as parents corner ''Senora Carla'' for ad hoc advice. She speaks to them in a jumble of English and Spanish, with an occasional ''oy, vay!'' She asked what they would like to learn in coming months. Computers drew a rousing yes. So did child psychology.</p>
        <p>School officials already see a change in the immigrants. ''They get a feeling this is their school, too,'' said Bob Bernstein, who just completed a year as interim principal at Mount Kisco Elementary. ''They come into the building with a sense of, 'Hey, I belong here too.' Plus, from what I can see, it's a catalyst for people to speak to each other.''</p>
        <p>So it is. Ms. Linares now recognizes Hispanic women at the supermarket and, since few have cars, offers to drive them home. She also persuaded her husband to try a meal at Azteca, a restaurant downtown, because she had met the owner. Ms. Linares said she ''felt intimidated, like I was in another country,'' which she said was a worthwhile lesson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Diaz, a gregarious woman, was discouraged by her dealings with Americans until she met Ms. Rediker, Ms. Linares and the other participants in the program. At a day care center a year and a half ago, when her daughter Emily had just arrived from the Dominican Republic, the child was punished for things she did not do because she spoke only Spanish and could not defend herself, the mother said.</p>
        <p>At school, where Emily just completed second grade, administrators have not noticed that Ms. Diaz speaks English, which she finds insulting, she said. She told Ms. Linares of these slights and was persuaded that some might have resulted from misunderstandings, not malice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Linares, too, has been guilty of hasty judgments. She told Ms. Diaz about the Hispanic parents who registered their children in school, mysteriously withdrew them and then brought them back months later, requiring the arduous paperwork to begin anew. Annoyed by what she saw as irresponsible behavior that was disruptive to the children and taxing to the staff, Ms. Linares remembered thinking, ''We have to educate these parents that they can't just take their children in and out of school.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Diaz's story, typical but usually unspoken, gave Ms. Linares insight into the unexplained comings and goings of the Hispanic children. Ms. Diaz had fled her country, and a failed marriage, while pregnant with Emily. But soon it was clear she would have to send the child back to the village of Bonao while she worked as a live-in nanny and a taxi dispatcher, with 18-hour shifts and a room in a boarding house. Only after Ms. Diaz was hired by T.J. Maxx, an apparel retailer, as a customer service representative, was she able to send for Emily. Reclaiming her other children, left with in-laws, is still a distant dream.</p>
        <p>Emily spent a recent afternoon ignoring the adult conversation in favor of the attentions of Ms. Linares's daughter, Dana, 15. Dana helped Emily finish her homework, taught her a card trick and gave her a bag of homemade chocolate chip cookies.</p>
        <p>''Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?'' Emily asked when it was time to go home.</p>
        <p>Later, in her own apartment, which Ms. Diaz shares with her boyfriend and a Mexican lodger, mother and daughter were brimming with enthusiasm about their visit. Emily, in a T-shirt down to her knees, scampered off to call her best friend, Natalie Valencia, who is from Colombia.</p>
        <p>Ms. Diaz said her new relationship with Ms. Linares had made her feel protected. ''This is somebody, if I'm falling down, she's going to give me a hand,'' Ms. Diaz said. ''I think she's going straight to heaven.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 13, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about a program that reaches out to immigrants in Mount Kisco, N.Y., misspelled the surname of a doctor who is organizing health screening for its participants. She is Dr. Amy Salerno, not Solerno. The article also misstated the birthplaces of her parents. Both were born in the United States.</p>
