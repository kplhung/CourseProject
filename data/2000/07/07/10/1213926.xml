        <p>Early Pioneer, a former claiming horse trying Grade I company for the first time and the longest shot in the field of nine, ran down the 7-5 favorite, General Challenge, in the stretch and captured the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup today.</p>
        <p>Early Pioneer ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 2/5  for the 1-length victory over General Challenge, with the New York invader David another 1 1/2 lengths back. The victory, which paid $51 for a $2 bet to win, was the first in a Grade I race for all of Early Pioneer's connections: his owners, David and Holly Wilson; his trainer, Vladimir Cerin; and his jockey, Victor Espinoza, Hollywood Park's leading rider, who replaced the regular rider, Matt Garcia, for this race.</p>

        <p>Early Pioneer, a former claiming horse trying Grade I company for the first time and the longest shot in the field of nine, ran down the 7-5 favorite, General Challenge, in the stretch and captured the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup today.</p>
        <p>Early Pioneer ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 2/5  for the 1-length victory over General Challenge, with the New York invader David another 1 1/2 lengths back. The victory, which paid $51 for a $2 bet to win, was the first in a Grade I race for all of Early Pioneer's connections: his owners, David and Holly Wilson; his trainer, Vladimir Cerin; and his jockey, Victor Espinoza, Hollywood Park's leading rider, who replaced the regular rider, Matt Garcia, for this race.</p>
        <p>David Wilson, who owns a string of Southern California auto dealerships and has a 25-horse stable, picked Early Pioneer out of an Oct. 25, 1998, sprint at Santa Anita based on Daily Racing Form past performances. He suggested Cerin claim the horse for $62,500 from the trainer Jerry Hollendorfer and the Golden Eagle Farm, owners of General Challenge.</p>
        <p>''I felt it would not be a good claim when we claimed him,'' Cerin said, adding that he called David Wilson ''after we took off the bandages and asked if he had claiming insurance. I didn't know if he'd survive the race. When I first looked at his ankles, I thought his career might be in jeopardy. But he's 100 percent sound.''</p>
        <p>The $600,000 first-place purse more than doubled Early Pioneer's career earnings. Most of the $506,815 had come from sprinting, and he had never run a mile and a quarter until today. His biggest victory had been the Grade II San Bernardino Handicap on April 9, when General Challenge finished third behind David. General Challenge came out of the race with an entrapped epiglottis, which closes the windpipe during eating, and underwent surgery. This was his first race in three months.</p>
        <p>''You hate to get beat, but he laid his body down,'' the trainer Bob Baffert said of General Challenge. ''At least the horse is back.''</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Espinoza, who also won the $300,000 Triple Bend Breeders' Cup aboard Elaborate today, got the mount only two weeks ago. Cerin conceded he had jumped on the jockey's bandwagon, noticing the dramatic improvement that had put Espinoza ahead of the world-class jockeys Corey Nakatani, Kent Desormeaux and Chris McCarron in the Hollywood Park standing. ''I just thought he was an O.K. transplant from Northern California who should have stayed there,'' Cerin said. ''But the kid is phenomenal seeing holes. He's really developing.''</p>
