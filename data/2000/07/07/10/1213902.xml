        <p>Classified work at the federal government's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has been suspended as a result of a security lapse, Energy Department and laboratory officials have said.</p>
        <p>Laboratory officials suspended all classified work at the installation in Richland, Wash., after an employee discovered a classified document had been left in an unclassified but locked office for about a day. Officials said classified work was stopped on July 3, after the classified document was discovered in an unclassified area on June 30.</p>
        <p>While some classified work has resumed, most secret operations at the laboratory remain suspended, and some employees have been shifted to unclassified work while an investigation is conducted, the officials said. Managers have been meeting with employees who work on classified projects ''to reinforce security awareness,'' Greg Koller, a spokesman for the laboratory, said.</p>
        <p>The security lapse at Pacific Northwest appears to have been minor, but officials responded aggressively because it came so soon after the publicity over lax security at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. At the New Mexico laboratory, two computer hard drives containing nuclear weapons data disappeared from a vault this spring, only to reappear behind a copying machine after the opening of an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Also, Wen Ho Lee, a former Los Alamos scientist, is awaiting trial on charges that he downloaded vast  amounts of nuclear weapons data from the classified computer network at Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Northwest laboratory is one of nine national laboratories, but its scientists do not design nuclear weapons. Instead, the laboratory, which has about 3,500 employees, focuses on environmental science. Only about 13 percent of its research is considered classified.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koller said the classified document was believed to have been misplaced on June 29 when a laboratory employee copied what he thought were unclassified drawings, and then placed them in an office outside the classified area. On June 30, another  employee discovered that one of the drawings was actually classified, and notified laboratory officials.</p>
        <p>No one at the laboratory has been  disciplined as a result of the incident, Mr. Koller said.</p>
