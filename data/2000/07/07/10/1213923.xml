        <p>THE left lens of his eyeglasses is missing. The pocket of his multicolored sports shirt bulges with plastic rulers and scraps of paper. And his rolling suitcase holds more charts and manuals than clean shirts and toiletries.</p>
        <p>Theodore A. Postol knows how to play the role of the rocket scientist that he is. He also knows how to infuriate Washington officialdom.</p>
        <p>Dr. Postol, a big, bearded 54-year-old physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has combined evidence, emotion and expletives in his crusade to prove that a proposed $60 billion missile shield for the United States is based on faulty science, fantasy and outright fraud.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon insists that his assertions are based on outdated information and ignorance of classified materials. Dr. Postol's scientist friends insist that he is one of the country's most learned ballistic missile experts and credit his research group at M.I.T. with groundbreaking analysis.</p>
        <p>Still, even his closest colleagues acknowledge that Dr. Postol suffers from a problem that has little to do with science and a lot to do with style. As a scientist, he brings laserlike precision to his work. But as a diplomat, he has all the subtlety of a Gatling gun.</p>
        <p>''This is a weapons system that is supposed to protect our families from nuclear attack, and these guys at the Pentagon are lying about its performance,'' Dr. Postol said during a visit to Washington last week. ''They know nothing, nothing. But they wrap themselves in the flag and point at me and say, 'You're not defending the country.' So I don't care who I offend.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in Dr. Postol's view, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish, the head of the Pentagon's ballistic missile office, are ''technically illiterate'' about missile defense. Condoleezza Rice, the chief foreign policy adviser for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is ''not interested in the truth.'' Leon S. Fuerth, the national security adviser for Vice President Al Gore, is ''uninformed and shows no interest in becoming informed.''</p>
        <p>Richard Garwin, a renowned physicist known for being politically independent and outspoken himself, said of Dr. Postol: ''Ted is a sound, original and energetic scientist who has done great work in this field. But diplomacy and Ted Postol are an oxymoron. Many, many times I have told him, 'You will be more effective if you are more controlled and edit your language.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Postol noted what his good friend had said and explained: ''I am a very polite person with people on the street, with taxi drivers. But if you talk about people with responsibility in government and they show no interest in the truth, I'm not going to say, 'They're nice people but they don't know the details.' ''</p>
        <p>THE second of three children, Dr. Postol grew up in a decaying neighborhood of Jewish immigrants in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. He said his father, a welder, beat him from the time he was a toddler. His mother, who worked in an Army data communications center, was ''a genius who basically lived for her children,'' Dr. Postol said.</p>
        <p>Although he was not interested in the basics of elementary education and had trouble reading, he recalled, he began building spaceships in kindergarten. ''When the teacher asked me what I wanted to do with my life, I said, 'I want to study the stars.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Postol discovered physics as an undergraduate and then a graduate student at the institute, which he attended on scholarship. ''I was blessed with a tremendous physical intuition,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Exempted from the draft because of an eye ailment, Dr. Postol stayed away from protests of the Vietnam War. Seminars by teachers who had helped build the atomic bomb made him a passionate critic of nuclear war.</p>
        <p>But he has not always been an outsider. He worked in the 1970's at an Energy Department nuclear lab, then co-wrote a study on MX missile basing for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. He studied submarine warfare from 1983 to 1984 for the chief of naval operations.</p>
        <p>''Working in the Pentagon turned out to be one of the best decisions of my life,'' he said. ''The sky was the limit. I could pretty much get into everything. I could learn whatever I wanted about nuclear war plans, ballistic missiles, early warning.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Postol also learned to respect the military, he said. ''The military officer would never abandon the battlefield without taking his wounded with him. The academic would say, 'You're on your own.' ''</p>
        <p>In the high-tech world, he is a rare bird: an institute professor with no outside consulting income. ''I have a rich wife,'' he joked, referring to the woman with whom he has lived for 17 years, a senior official at an investment company. They have never married and have no children.</p>
        <p>Dr. Postol has angered the Pentagon many times before, most dramatically when he successfully challenged the ''success'' of the Patriot missile in shooting down Iraqi missiles in the Persian Gulf war. But he still holds security clearances that give him access to classified material. (''I don't use them anyway,'' he said. ''They're useless.'')</p>
        <p>And despite his opposition to the missile defense plan, he said that if the United States was determined to build it, he would help develop what he believes is a more feasible approach: a boost-phase technology that would shoot at enemy missiles in the first few minutes after launching. ''I don't like missile defense,'' he said, ''but if we have to have it, let's have a system that works.''</p>
