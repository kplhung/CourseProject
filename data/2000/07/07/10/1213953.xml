        <p>A man injured in a three-alarm fire that ravaged an East Side apartment on Saturday night died yesterday, the second person killed by a blaze so intense that it caused a thunderous explosion that blew out the windows and showered the street with glass.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the second victim, whom the police had not been able to identify, never regained consciousness after he was pulled from the apartment with burns over 85 percent of his body.

        <p>A man injured in a three-alarm fire that ravaged an East Side apartment on Saturday night died yesterday, the second person killed by a blaze so intense that it caused a thunderous explosion that blew out the windows and showered the street with glass.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the second victim, whom the police had not been able to identify, never regained consciousness after he was pulled from the apartment with burns over 85 percent of his body. He died at New York Weill Cornell Center at 11:20 a.m. The first victim, a woman with blond hair who has also not been identified, was found dead in the burning apartment.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said investigators believed that the fire, which broke out at 10:25 p.m. Saturday in the top floor of a brick six-story apartment building at 408 East 65th Street, began in a fuse box and quickly spread, igniting a nearby mattress.</p>
        <p>''It appears that there may have been improper electrical work done as late as the morning before the fire started,'' Sergeant McInnis said. A fuse had been changed, he said, and it appeared the new fuse overheated and caught fire.</p>
        <p>John Wallace, a resident of the building for 12 years, said he heard an explosion about 10:30 p.m. and saw fire shooting out of the apartment's windows ''like a blowtorch.''</p>
        <p>Firefighters arrived promptly, the tenants said, but were hampered in their efforts because the building did not have sprinklers and the first firefighters had to carry hose up six narrow flights of stairs.</p>
        <p>Residents of the building were shaken and angry yesterday, saying they had been placed at risk by the apartment's tenant, John Hale, 60, who the authorities said had allowed transients to stay with him for extended periods of time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale was not home at the time of the fire. Attempts in the neighborhood yesterday to find Mr. Hale for comment were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>The police also said their efforts to identify the victims were frustrated because Mr. Hale's guests were known to him only by their nicknames. Even the woman's approximate age was unknown. The man was believed to be in his 20's.</p>
        <p>''It was something of a flophouse,'' Sergeant McInnis said.</p>
        <p>Although some tenants said they suspected that the apartment had been used as an illegal drug-manufacturing laboratory, the police said they found no evidence of such activity. ''The place was not a lab,'' Sergeant McInnis said. ''There was no lab equipment, and no sign of drug manufacturing.''</p>
        <p>The police also said that their records showed no complaints of drug activity at Mr. Hale's apartment.</p>
        <p>The blaze took nearly an hour to control, said Firefighter Vito Berretta, a Fire Ddepartment spokesman. The fire was contained to Mr. Hale's apartment, but other apartments sustained smoke and water damage, Firefighter Berretta said. At least six people who lived in other apartments were relocated after the fire, tenants said.</p>
