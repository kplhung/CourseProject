        <p>Just 10 days after the Yankees traded for David Justice and made Shane Spencer their permanent left fielder, Spencer tore a ligament in a knee in the first inning of last night's game against the Mets and is out for the season.</p>
        <p>Spencer has a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said after the game, and will have reconstructive surgery once the swelling in the joint goes down. Spencer declined to answer questions, indicating through a team spokesman that he was too upset to talk.</p>
        <p>His teammates were stunned. ''It's terrible,'' said Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman. ''After he finally got a chance to play every day, and then to have this happen.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' Melvin Mora looped a hit to Spencer's right to lead off the bottom of the first inning, and Spencer rushed over, bent down and then fell down, in obvious pain, before throwing the ball back to the infield from his knees. When teammates reached Spencer, he told them he felt something pop in his knee.</p>
        <p>Spencer eventually got to his feet and walked off under his own power. Knoblauch returned to the Yankees' clubhouse between innings and found Spencer with an ice pack on his knee, but hopeful; Spencer told Knoblauch his pain had dissipated.</p>
        <p>But Spencer was taken for a magnetic resonance imaging exam, which revealed the extent of his injury. Spencer had bruised the same knee slamming into the fence at Yankee Stadium last Monday, but Cashman said he was told the injuries were unrelated.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, was told about Spencer's injury when he returned to his office after last night's game, and he appeared shaken by the news. ''He's worked so hard to be in the situation he's in, and now he's going to be put on hold,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Spencer, 28, is a 28th-round draft pick who slowly pushed his way through the Yankees' farm system, playing six seasons in rookie ball and Class A before spending parts of four seasons in Class AAA. He broke into the big leagues like a comet in 1998, slugging 10 home runs in 67 at-bats, but was mostly luckless in 1999, when he was sidelined by food poisoning and a rapid heart rate and lost the left-field competition to Ricky Ledee.</p>
        <p>It appeared last winter that Spencer might become trade bait, but the suspension of Darryl Strawberry in February gave Spencer a chance to play on at least a part-time basis. Ledee was frazzled by trade rumors throughout spring training and into the regular season, but Spencer -- a hard worker who has been through much in his career -- was unfazed. He thrived, batting .282 with 9 homers and 40 runs batted in. He has been arguably the Yankees' best defensive outfielder this year.</p>
        <p>Ledee was traded to Cleveland for Justice, and Spencer won the job in left, but it would not be his for long. ''Shane's pretty distraught,'' Cashman said.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter said: ''He was hitting great, playing great defense. It's terrible, man.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch added: ''I'm sure it caught him off guard. It caught everybody off guard.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees will begin examining their alternatives today, the first day of the three-day All-Star Game break. They do not appear to have many internal options. They could use the veteran Felix Jose occasionally, maybe shifting Justice to left. The organization's top outfield prospect is Jackson Melian, who probably is at least two years away from being ready for the major leagues.</p>
        <p>The Yankees will explore trade options, as well. The Orioles are willing to talk about their left fielder, B. J. Surhoff, and Houston's Moises Alou said since the Justice trade that he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause -- for a huge contract extension. San Francisco is dangling the veteran outfielder Ellis Burks. Texas, falling out of the American League West race, might shop Chad Curtis, who was acquired from the Yankees last year. The Yankees could rekindle talks with Oakland about designated hitter John Jaha. Only a handful of teams have been open to trading so far, but others presumably will listen as the July 31 trading deadline approaches.</p>
        <p>The best solutions within the organization could be unorthodox. They could shift Justice to left, move Jose Vizcaino to second base and use Knoblauch as their designated hitter, something Torre has done from time to time in the last few weeks because of Knoblauch's throwing problems. Alfonso Soriano, their most developed offensive prospect, has been playing second base for Class AAA Columbus, and the Yankees could take a chance by promoting him to play that position and using Knoblauch as the D.H., although that would seem a long shot; Knoblauch has been throwing better in the last week.</p>
        <p>''We'll take a look at all of our options,'' Torre said.</p>
