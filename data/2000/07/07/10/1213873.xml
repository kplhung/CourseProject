        <p>Here is a documentary that asks a great deal. It asks you to be patient, for one thing, as you spend an hour and half in the company of an articulate but oddly distracted boy who clearly has no capacity for patience himself.</p>
        <p>Stick with it. This film, which begins with a series of seemingly disjointed impressions, coalesces into a moving study of the boy, his family and his condition. The more you know, the more you care. The more you care, the more your heart will break.</p>
        <p>''George: A Family Documentary,'' the film by Henry Corra and Grahame Weinbren that HBO is showing tonight, is Mr. Corra's loving portrait and guilty apology to his autistic son, George. Made in 1995, when the boy was 12 and his father gave him a video camera for his birthday, it intersperses bits of George's own monologues and quirky interviews with his father's professional sequences and quirky interviews.</p>
        <p>At first George, handsome and energetic, seems no different from any boy his age. But when he starts to share his passion for planes and recites his storehouse of statistics about every type of airliner, the distinctions begin to come into focus. Although he must be reminded to look people in the eye when speaking to them, he has no trouble addressing his own camera head-on with random information like the day's weather forecast.</p>
        <p>His father's camera follows George on a real flying lesson (''That was great,'' he says) and on a visit to the United Nations, where he can name the country represented by every flag flying outside.</p>
        <p>The camera also trails him at his special school, where his classmates share with Mr. Corra their observations on being different themselves. Thrilled at the prospect of being on television, they perform a song, written by one of the students, that describes their lives as being ''caught between a rock and a hard place.''</p>
        <p>If this weren't all bittersweet enough, Henry Corra gets word that HBO has decided to withdraw from the project because George does not seem ''autistic enough.'' (Mr. Corra vows to press on.) And hovering over the film is the figure of George's uncle Tom Corra. He plays melancholy music on his cello and talks about the boy, who can deal with endless facts but ''not concepts that have to do with interrelationships, especially of human beings.'' The film is dedicated to the memory of Tom Corra, who died in 1998.</p>
        <p>The months covered by the documentary also include the decision by George's parents to separate. ''You're not, you're not gonna stay with us anymore,'' the boy, eyes fixed on a video game, says to his father in an uninflected statement. But it is quickly followed by an anguished question, ''Not anymore?''</p>
        <p>Speaking off screen, Henry Corra admits that to escape his own distress over George's autism, he kept diving ever deeper into his work. At least that work ultimately helped bring the two of them closer, he says.</p>
        <p>Only toward the end does the film bring out the talking heads to help the viewer begin to make sense of all this, including a psychologist who speaks of the sensory overload the autistic must bear. But that burden is not totally negative, says Mark Ramoser, an autistic adult.</p>
        <p>''We see and hear things that the rest of you might have to have pointed out,'' he says, things like the sound of a brook or the grain pattern in a piece of wood. ''I gather most of you neuro-typicals barely even notice that.''</p>
        <p>Much is left unexplained by ''George.'' You're left to wonder what has happened to the family members since 1995. And you're left to wonder what led the neuro-typicals at HBO to show the film now, and at an inconvenient hour.</p>
        <p>Still, there is much to be learned from this documentary. Yes, some of its concepts are difficult to process. But that just may be the whole point.</p>
        <p>GEORGE  A Family Documentary  HBO, tonight at 6</p>
        <p>Produced by Henry Corra; directed by Henry Corra and Grahame Weinbren, with George Corra. For HBO, supervising producer, Carole Rosen; executive producer, Sheila Nevins.</p>
