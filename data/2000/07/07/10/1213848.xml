        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree with your contention that the police need more intensive training on issues of gender relations and gender-related violence (editorial, July 6).</p>
        <p>I would suggest, however, that police reaction to recent assaults in Central Park reflects another of the deep-rooted issues that continue to erode public confidence in the police. While better entry-level training for police is clearly needed, continuing in-service training should be required for all members of the department at every level.</p>

        <p>I agree with your contention that the police need more intensive training on issues of gender relations and gender-related violence (editorial, July 6).</p>
        <p>I would suggest, however, that police reaction to recent assaults in Central Park reflects another of the deep-rooted issues that continue to erode public confidence in the police. While better entry-level training for police is clearly needed, continuing in-service training should be required for all members of the department at every level.</p>
        <p>The training should reinforce the notion that those who take the oath to serve have a duty to conduct themselves as professionals. We need a continuing commitment to changing both the formal and informal socialization processes that influence the conduct of our police. As a former New York City cop, I believe that the social contract between the public and the police requires nothing less.</p>
