        <p>A student and a teacher from a Roman Catholic high school on Long Island were killed Saturday when the van they were in crashed during a class trip in Arizona, the authorities in Flagstaff, Ariz., said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The driver of the van, Brother Lawrence Zarzycki, a mathematics teacher at Chaminade High School in Mineola, died when the van ran off a highway about 40 miles south of the Grand Canyon, the police said.</p>
        <p>Brother Zarzycki and the student, Brendan Tracey, 16, were declared dead at the scene from massive trauma, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The students and Brother Zarzycki were on a trip called the U.S.A. Study Tour, an end-of-the-school-year tradition that combines religious, historical and educational sightseeing, the Rev. James Williams, Chaminade's president, said last night.</p>
        <p>The group had flown to Salt Lake City several weeks ago and rented the van, and it was headed to the Grand Canyon, Father Williams said.</p>
        <p>On Saturday at 11:45 a.m., Brother Zarzycki, 38, was driving north on State Highway 64 when the van veered off the road about 14 miles south of Valle, Ariz., and rolled over one and a half times, the Flagstaff Department of Public Safety said. The Associated Press reported that after the van left the road, Brother Zarzycki tried to steer it back on and overcorrected.</p>
        <p>Brother Zarzycki was wearing his seat belt, and Mr. Tracey was not, the police said. Two other students, James Iovino and Kevin Pedersen, both 16, were taken to Flagstaff Medical Center for observation, the Department of Public Safety said. Seven other passengers were uninjured, the police said.</p>
        <p>Father Williams described both victims as beloved members of the school, an all-boys institution of 1,600 students run by the Society of Marianists, a Catholic order.</p>
        <p>''You're talking about a high-powered kid and a high-powered brother here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tracey was an editor of the school yearbook, an athlete and a lover of the outdoors, Father Williams said. As part of a volunteer program, he was building a wheelchair-accessible meditation garden for residents of the Queen of Peace Nursing Home in Queens.</p>
        <p>''Picture a junk lot,'' Father Williams said. ''They turned it into something beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Brother Zarzycki was a Chaminade alumnus who graduated in 1980, joined the Marianists and returned to Chaminade as a teacher in 1985, Father Williams said. He ran the school's annual food and clothing drives for the poor and taught students how to give religious instruction to Catholic children who do not attend Catholic schools, Father Williams said.</p>
        <p>Chaminade has been running U.S.A. Study trips about every other year for three decades, he said.</p>
        <p>There were more students on the trip traveling in another van, but the rest of their trip has been canceled and they were being sent home, he said, adding that the school was shocked by the news of the crash.</p>
        <p>''This has been a loss to a family,'' Father Williams said, though he added that the blow had been cushioned by the prayers and wishes of the school's extended community. ''I've gotten calls all day from current students, alumni, brothers and priests from across the country. There's been a tremendous outpouring of faith.''</p>
