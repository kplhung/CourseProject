        <p>With projections of the federal budget surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode, the debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.</p>
        <p>Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most Democrats will support, and there is unlikely to be any legislative breakthrough this year.</p>
        <p>But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from President Clinton on down are joining Republicans in backing tax cuts -- enthusiastically in some cases, grudgingly and with conditions in others -- to a far greater degree than they were a year or even six months ago.</p>
        <p>In one of the clearest signs of shifting sentiment, nearly a third of the Democrats in the House broke ranks with the party last month and voted to repeal the federal estate tax.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore doubled his proposed tax-cutting package a few weeks ago, to $500 billion over 10 years, moving him closer to the $1.3 trillion plan offered by his Republican rival for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Clinton announced recently that he would agree to a $250 billion, 10-year tax cut for married couples on Republican terms if Congress would pass his plan to add prescription drug coverage to the Medicare system of health insurance for the elderly and disabled.</p>
        <p>The new political dynamics will be on display in Congress this week when the Senate takes up the two big tax-cutting bills of the year: the repeal of the federal estate tax and the reduction of taxes on nearly all married couples in the name of eliminating the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leaves some two-income couples paying a bigger tax bill than they would if they had remained single.</p>
        <p>On the estate tax repeal, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said he was hopeful that he might be able to attract enough support from Democrats to overcome procedural hurdles and force a final vote on the bill this week.</p>
        <p>If they can get past those hurdles, Republicans are all but assured of passing the bill. Repealing the estate tax has long been one of the Republicans' priorities.</p>
        <p>The Senate legislation, identical to the version passed by the House, would gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the tax, which applies only to estates valued at $675,000 or more, a threshold that is already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006.</p>
        <p>The White House has made clear that Mr. Clinton will veto the bill. But Republicans say that just passing the legislation with bipartisan support would be a powerful political symbol of opposition to the tax, and they have not ruled out bringing the bill up again as part of an end-of-the-year budget package.</p>
        <p>For years it was Democratic orthodoxy to label repeal of the estate tax a giveaway to the very richest people in the country. But to try to reduce defections from their ranks and display their own tax-cutting credentials, Democrats in the Senate are planning to offer a less expensive alternative proposal on the estate tax, as their counterparts in the House did last month.</p>
        <p>The Democratic proposal is expected to call for the effective elimination of the tax for two politically powerful constituencies that say they are hard hit by it -- owners of small businesses and family farms -- but to continue to impose the tax at reduced rates on the very largest estates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott also plans to bring up the marriage penalty bill by the end of the week under a procedure that would keep Democrats from stalling the bill or loading it with amendments.</p>
        <p>The bill, which would cut taxes on married couples by $248 billion over 10 years, is larger than a version passed this year by the House. As with the estate tax, Democrats plan to offer a less expensive alternative. They would seek to eliminate the marriage penalty without giving a tax cut to couples who already receive a marriage bonus -- that is, a lower tax bill than they would pay if they had remained single.</p>
        <p>Since Republicans have shown no signs of accepting his proposal to swap a tax cut for the prescription drug coverage plan, Mr. Clinton is likely to veto the marriage penalty bill if it passes. But Republicans said they could nonetheless go to their party convention at the end of the month able to tell voters that they had done their part to enact big tax cuts and that it was a Democrat in the White House who had blocked them.</p>
        <p>Some analysts say the two parties will remain stalemated on fiscal policy as long as control of Congress and the White House remains divided. Others are more optimistic about a compromise on tax cuts, perhaps even this year, because there is enough money for both parties to get what they want.</p>
        <p>''It's just a question of horse trading at this point,'' said Bruce Bartlett, a fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative research group.</p>
        <p>But the supercharged politics of the campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.</p>
        <p>The muddled outlook reflects in part the uncertainty in both parties about how much demand there is among voters for tax cuts. And the evolving politics of tax cuts are just one illustration of how the quickly increasing surplus projections are forcing both parties to rethink their ideology and tactics on fiscal issues.</p>
        <p>Last month, the White House increased its estimate of the total budget surplus for the next 10 years by nearly $1.3 trillion, to $4.2 trillion. Long-term budget forecasts are notoriously unreliable, and the fiscal outlook could change substantially based on how the economy performs.</p>
        <p>The two parties have agreed not to use the portion of the surplus generated by Social Security -- $2.3 trillion over the next decade -- for tax cuts or general spending. But that still leaves a projected windfall of $1.9 trillion on the table, and just as Democrats are becoming more open to tax cuts, Republicans are proving more willing to go along with expanding government programs.</p>
        <p>''There is a changing climate on tax cuts,'' said Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, a Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee. Mr. Roth said the larger surplus projections, the possibility that the long economic expansion might be starting to run out of steam and Mr. Clinton's willingness to negotiate a deal had combined to give tax reductions new political viability.</p>
        <p>Democrats also said the rosier fiscal outlook had made tax cutting more appealing -- or at least made it more politically difficult to reject all tax cuts out of hand.</p>
        <p>They also said tax cuts were getting more bipartisan consideration because Republicans in Congress had dropped their insistence on putting forward all-encompassing tax reduction bills that would use all or most of the projected surpluses and instead were addressing specific types of tax cuts one by one.</p>
        <p>Democrats generally remain solidly opposed to broad-based tax-cutting packages of the type proposed by Mr. Bush in his presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''Democrats have always been willing to consider, if not support, tax cuts that are fair, while reflecting our priorities and the need for sound fiscal management of the surplus,'' said Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic Council.</p>
        <p>''What has changed is that instead of the Republicans in Congress offering a single, excessive tax-cut package that could be rejected immediately as breaking the bank,'' Mr. Sperling said, ''they are now trying to slice their tax agenda into smaller pieces, which can be individually considered on the basis of fairness, fiscal prudence and priorities.''</p>
        <p>In the coming week, Democrats plan to hit the Republicans hard on those points, asserting that the Republican versions of the estate tax and marriage penalty bills are much too expensive and too tilted to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>And they intend to make a case that tax cuts are justifiable only after the two parties agree on more pressing issues, in particular adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare and allocating more of the surplus to reducing the national debt.</p>
        <p>''Democrats believe you can eliminate the marriage penalty and reduce the estate tax, and at the same time provide Americans with a prescription drug benefit,'' said Ranit Schmelzer, communications director for Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>''Republicans just want to do the tax cut,'' Ms. Schmelzer said.</p>
        <p>Senator Roth says Republicans, too, think there is enough money for a sizable tax cut, a prescription drug benefit and a steady reduction of the national debt. He said that as he traveled through his home state, he found considerable support among voters for acting now to repeal the estate tax and to cut taxes on couples.</p>
        <p>Republicans are banking on getting support from Democrats who are up for re-election this year and do not want to have to explain their opposition to tax cuts.</p>
        <p>They point to Democrats like Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia, who is in a tough race this year in an anti-tax state and who supports repeal of the estate tax.</p>
        <p>But some Republicans acknowledge that their party also needs to be willing to compromise if it wants Mr. Clinton to sign any tax cuts into law, and that if they play politics with the issue they will be exposed to assertions by Democrats that Republicans have run a do-nothing Congress.</p>
        <p>''I'm a strong believer that what people back home want to see at election time is what you've accomplished,'' said Mr. Roth, who is also in a tight re-election race. ''There are some on both sides who want an issue, not legislation, but I think that's shortsighted.''</p>
