        <p>All for Bach  The 42nd season of the free Washington Square Music festival will open at 8 tomorrow night, when Kenneth Cooper leads the Festival Baroque Band in an all-Bach program. The concert takes place near the statue of Garibaldi in the southeast quadrant of the park. In case of rain, it moves to New York University's Frederick Loewe Theater, 35 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village. Information: (212) 431-1088.</p>
        <p>Living Color  In Germany and Switzerland in the late Gothic and Renaissance eras, the art of stained glass attained new heights. From a collaborative effort between draftsmen who drew the pictorial designs and artists who rendered enduring images of storytelling and devotion came stained-glass church windows and small panels in private homes. Beginning tomorrow, more than 60 glass panels and some 80 drawings, with a focus on works designed by Albrecht Durer and Hans Holbein the Younger, go on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. ''Painting on Light: Drawings and Stained Glass in the Age of Durer and Holbein'' continues through Sept. 24. Information: (310) 440-7300.</p>
        <p>Lawn Art  Accompanied by a Korean percussion ensemble, a dance exploration of the vision of Chinese philosophers. Set to music by Pergolesi and Albinoni, a dance duet. And a new composition inspired by Indonesian gamelan music but performed on found objects and original instruments like a clay-pot marimba and a saw-blade gong. These are the attractions when Dancing in the Streets and Wave Hill, the estate in Riverdale, the Bronx, present ''Dances for Wave Hill.'' The outdoor performances by the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, Guta Hedewig, and Lisa Townsend and Terry Dame's Junkyard Gamelan are scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, 5 p.m. Sunday and 6:30 p.m. on July 19. Information: (718) 549-3200.</p>
