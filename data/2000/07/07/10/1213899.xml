        <p>The failure of Saturday's test of the Clinton administration's prototype missile defense system should be the clinching argument for delaying any construction of such a system until the next presidential term. More rigorous testing, and patient diplomacy, will be needed before a decision can be responsibly taken. In practical terms, those requirements should defer building a missile defense system at least until the next president takes office.</p>
        <p>Designing a missile shield that could protect against limited attack from erratic states like North Korea, Iran or Iraq is reasonable. But the prototype system now being tested has not yet been shown to be sufficiently reliable to protect American cities. In the three tests so far, the interceptor twice missed the mock incoming warhead and produced one partial success. The failure on Saturday came from a breakdown in one of the system's simplest components. The sophisticated interceptor vehicle failed to separate from its booster rocket. As a result, none of the high-tech sensors the interceptor uses to hunt down its target were activated. One of the biggest uncertainties is the doubt expressed by many scientists as to whether the interceptor rocket, or kill vehicle, can be fooled by cheap, balloon-like decoys. That question remains unanswered.</p>

        <p>Designing a missile shield that could protect against limited attack from erratic states like North Korea, Iran or Iraq is reasonable. But the prototype system now being tested has not yet been shown to be sufficiently reliable to protect American cities. In the three tests so far, the interceptor twice missed the mock incoming warhead and produced one partial success. The failure on Saturday came from a breakdown in one of the system's simplest components. The sophisticated interceptor vehicle failed to separate from its booster rocket. As a result, none of the high-tech sensors the interceptor uses to hunt down its target were activated. One of the biggest uncertainties is the doubt expressed by many scientists as to whether the interceptor rocket, or kill vehicle, can be fooled by cheap, balloon-like decoys. That question remains unanswered.</p>
        <p>Given the latest test failure, Washington has every reason not to rush its decision on building the system, especially since ordering construction now would unravel existing arms control treaties. Negotiations with Moscow are continuing on amending the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate a defensive system. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has proposed his own version of a shared missile defense, which deserves further consideration. China and Europe also have serious concerns about America's current missile defense plans.</p>
        <p>The administration's original goal was to have a system ready to use by 2005, the year by which intelligence agencies estimate North Korea might be able to reach Alaskan or Hawaiian soil with a few crude nuclear armed missiles. But whether North Korea is likely to do so is also an important consideration. Since last fall, North Korea has been observing a moratorium on long-range missile tests. Other potential threats, like Iran and Iraq, are considered many years away from being able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>That leaves no compelling reason for ordering construction other than the perception that doing so might shield Al Gore from Republican attack. Partisan political considerations should not drive such an important defense decision.</p>
