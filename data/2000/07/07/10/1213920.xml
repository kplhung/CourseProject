        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her emphasis on economic issues today, renewing her call for the Federal Trade Commission to broaden its investigation of sharply increased gasoline prices and urging Congress to pass legislation to create an oil reserve for states in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>In the fourth day of her Senate campaign tour through upstate New York, Mrs. Clinton rejected as ''a serious error'' any move to eliminate the gasoline tax, a proposal advocated by her Republican rival, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''I reject my opponent's proposal of eliminating the gas tax,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference earlier today in Rochester. ''One of the few sources of revenue that we actually get more of than we send to Washington is gas tax money for our transportation needs. It would be hard to imagine how upstate can finish all the work we need to do without the federal help that comes from transportation dollars.''</p>
        <p>On the investigation into gasoline prices, Mrs. Clinton said that it was imperative for the commission to ''go beyond where it has already begun to try to figure out why, while fuel costs have gone up over 50 cents in New York, profits for major oil companies have gone up more than 500 percent.''</p>
        <p>In the tour, which is covering a dozen communities across the state's western, Southern Tier and Finger Lake regions, Mrs. Clinton has sought to discuss policies that would affect the troubled upstate economy.</p>
        <p>While her campaign has called this trip the ''Upstate Economic Tour,'' it has been more of a cookout and picnic tour. Mrs. Clinton has appeared at several picnics and rallies sponsored by the Democratic Party in a number of upstate counties. This afternoon, in Van Buren, N.Y., she spoke at a cookout organized by party officials of Cayuga, Oswego and Onondaga Counties. At a similar event here this evening, she spoke to more than 500 Democrats and union members from four counties. Mrs. Clinton spoke about the need to lower utility costs, to stimulate job growth and to rehabilitate this region's roads and highways.</p>
        <p>In speaking with voters at the picnics and other events, as in previous visits to this region, Mrs. Clinton has been asked most frequently about her ideas and proposals to revive the economy in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton began the day at the Mount Olivet Baptist Church in Rochester. It had not been announced in advance to members of the church that Mrs. Clinton would be worshiping there this morning, and her presence seem to take nearly everyone by surprise. Seated beside William A. Johnson Jr., Rochester's mayor, she swayed and clapped to the music by the choir.</p>
        <p>''I stand here today before you today to thank those of you who prayed for me and my husband,'' Mrs. Clinton said, standing in the sanctuary of the church and addressing an enthusiastic congregation. ''I believe that we were both sustained and uplifted because of prayer. And so I thank you and ask you not to quit yet.''</p>
