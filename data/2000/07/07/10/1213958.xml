        <p>The man who prefers to be called Frankie, not Frank, is sunbathing on the Boardwalk, as human action figures and the women who love them strut past. He has his shirt rolled up to expose a belly as white as anything coming out of that frozen-custard machine a few yards away.</p>
        <p>He is taking a break from his concession stall, which includes a pop-the-balloon game, a shoot-the-basketball game and his baby -- the franchise -- a ''Shoot the Geek'' game he created. ''It took a lot of intelligence,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Carnival aficionados will wonder whether Frankie Rainey has resurrected from infamy the geek show, which involved biting the heads off live chickens and -- well, never mind. His attraction sheds no blood, but it is every bit as primal, every bit as brainless: a kid earning $6 an hour and dressed in a secondhand hockey goalie's outfit prances about while people shoot him with 30 paint balls out of a semiautomatic gun.</p>
        <p>Cost: $5. Time spent: 45 seconds, maybe.</p>
        <p>It is a beautiful thing, Mr. Rainey says with a roll of his shoulders. ''I had the idea of 'Shoot the Geek,' and they took to it.''</p>
        <p>We, of course, are ''they'': who accounted for 309 million visits to amusement parks last year, who spent a combined $9.1 billion to have our insides rearranged on some loop-the-loop ride, to vent our road rage on a doe-eyed kid in the next bumper car, to shoot the geek. We are the suckers, the rubes, the marks seeking safe thrills and some trophy attesting to our prowess with a mallet or water pistol. A stuffed animal is the goal, but a plastic ring will do.</p>
        <p>Many of us gravitate toward what the amusement industry calls F.E.C.'s -- family entertainment centers -- where the air smacks of manufactured confection. But those establishments owe a debt to their older, mischievous cousins, places where beach sand salts the funnel cake, the guys operating the rides are scarier than the rides themselves, and the soda-soaked boardwalk grips like a no-pest strip.</p>
        <p>A place like Seaside Heights.</p>
        <p>For decades the mile-long Boardwalk has beckoned with its come-hither lights, twinkling like a multicolored mirage on the shores of the Atlantic. It is the defiant reprobate of the Jersey Shore, outliving the disapproval of neighboring religious retreats, rebuilding itself after a vicious northeaster caused it to be consumed in rain and fire in 1955.</p>
        <p>John Camera, the administrator of the Seaside Heights borough, says the community has made strides in polishing its somewhat seamy image. A million-dollar investment in the main road, known as the Boulevard, has attracted new businesses, and the Boardwalk itself has undergone improvements: new bathrooms, attractive garbage cans, and the periodic replacement of the Southern yellow-pine slats that bear the weight of thousands of summer visitors a day.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Camera says the borough's elders have tried not to tamper with their home's gaudy essence. ''We realize there are a lot of aspects of Seaside Heights that are honky-tonk, a throwback to the 1950's,'' he said. ''Much of the Boardwalk looks very similar to the way it did in the 50's. And we appreciate that.''</p>
        <p>That includes the necessary assault on the senses, from the barkers shouting check-it-out come-ons above a Wurlitzer organ's grind to that perfect melange of aromas: sausage, onions, frying dough, beer, cigarette smoke, sweat. It includes the prides of teenage boys and girls sporting tattoos that will blur blue with time. And it includes the denizens, the Frankie Raineys, who bring world-weariness to amusement.</p>
        <p>In the winter he deals blackjack in Atlantic City, but in the summer he manages his ''Shoot the Geek'' stall, which requires constant attention. First, there is the help, he says, pointing to an employee who appears to be approaching a Zenlike state. Then there is the scheduling: ''Usually I have four geeks on hand, working three- and four-hour shifts.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of prolonged exposure to the sun, Mr. Rainey begins to explain the open secrets of the Boardwalk. Hold on to your straw boaters: it's all a scam.</p>
        <p>For example, there are two approaches to the old score-a-basket, win-a-prize game. There is the one-shot-for-$2 game, just up the Boardwalk, which uses overinflated balls and small, bent hoops set at a considerable distance. Or there is the friendlier, dollar-a-ball game, offered by Mr. Rainey, with deflated balls and wide hoops positioned much closer to the shooter.</p>
        <p>''The way we zing 'em is the prize,'' he explains. The prize is worth maybe 40 cents, so even if the customer wins, he loses. But he gets to show off for his girlfriend or his kid; that means he will want to come back again and be the Big Man, eagerly throwing his money away. ''It's all psychology,'' says the man behind ''Shoot the Geek.'' ''It's all how you lay it down.''</p>
        <p>A few doors up from Mr. Rainey's psychological experiment is Lucky Leo's, where patrons play video poker and Skee-Ball to win points that can be redeemed for prizes reverently displayed in glass cases. The establishment's economy would be beyond the ken of Keynes: a plastic ring is worth 5 points; a rabbit's foot, 500 points; a ceramic ''Holy Cross'' or a pair of ''Magic Glasses,'' 800 points; a 12-inch oscillating fan, 15,000 points; a gold-plated flatware set, 90,000 points; and an autographed jersey signed by the quarterback Steve Young, 300,000 points.</p>
        <p>That is a lot of Skee-Ball.</p>
        <p>Out on the Boardwalk, a man struggles to find a scientific method for launching a rubber frog, by mallet, into a plastic flower; a sign -- ''Frog body must be in flower to win'' -- heightens the pressure. Nearby, people throw their quarters away, in the vain hope that one will land on a glass plate. Above the clinking, the pot-bellied barker shouts out the odd question: ''How about it?''</p>
        <p>In the bowels of the Boardwalk, in a maze of rooms beneath the carousel, there is a glass-encased booth where crumpled cigarette stubs clutter an ashtray and faded photographs of old Little League teams hang on the wall. This is the domain of Bill Erwin, the bleary-eyed general manager of Casino Pier, a section of the Boardwalk that includes 34 rides and dozens of arcades.</p>
        <p>''First aid?'' he says into a walkie-talkie, as the smoke of yet another cigarette curls into his eyes. ''Can you head down to the miniature golf course? Bring a bandage and some peroxide. Little girl cut her foot.''</p>
        <p>He is 60 years old, a former high school teacher, a local. He has spent the last 45 summers at the Boardwalk, and has done it all: operating games of chance, owning a few rides, running a stand dedicated to Taylor pork roll. He has the right to say what few others can: ''Believe me, I've sliced thousands and thousands of pounds of Taylor pork roll.''</p>
        <p>He has seen some attractions fall out of favor -- Taylor pork roll, for one -- and others emerge to fill the void. He has seen lean times and flush times, all of which have taught him one thing: the weather rules. A few years ago it was a string of rainy weekends, not the economy, that sucker-punched the Boardwalk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erwin lumbers up the stairs, past the fun mirrors and onto the Boardwalk. He glides through the crowds to chat with some of the foreign-exchange students -- from Belarus, Kenya, Latvia, Poland -- working the booths, and to check on the rides he owns: the Poltergeist, the Gravitron and the Tornado. Yes, he says, there is a bit of a con going on, and yes, the sounds and smells can be a bit overwhelming. But think of Seaside Heights as though it were a show on Broadway, he says. ''Remember: it's all a stage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Erwin looks up, crinkles his face in concern and says, ''I smell dampness.''</p>
        <p>He is right. Soon an evening storm will cleanse the Boardwalk of spilled beer, melted ice cream -- and people. But before it comes, Wilbert Jackson, a water company employee from Teaneck, pitches a plastic ring into a sea of bottles. It bounces about before coming to rest, miraculously, around the top of one bottle: a winner.</p>
        <p>''A big lucky vinner today!'' barks the Polish exchange student operating the booth, as Mr. Jackson screams for joy and hugs his wife and two young children.</p>
        <p>''I won a bicycle!'' he shouts. ''First time I won anything in my life!''</p>
        <p>The family chooses a yellow Huffy that hangs from the ceiling, and then Mr. Jackson treats everyone to funnel cake. As the rain begins, he walks the bicycle off the Boardwalk, gripping its handlebars as though he half expects it to disappear.</p>
