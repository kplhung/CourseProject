        <p>Senior advisers to President Clinton said today they still expect him to make a decision this summer on whether to proceed with a missile defense system, but they acknowledged that the failure of a major test on Saturday  made it far more likely that Mr. Clinton's successor would ultimately decide the fate of the huge project.</p>

        <p>Senior advisers to President Clinton said today they still expect him to make a decision this summer on whether to proceed with a missile defense system, but they acknowledged that the failure of a major test on Saturday  made it far more likely that Mr. Clinton's successor would ultimately decide the fate of the huge project.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, this does go to the question of technical feasibility or how far along the system is,'' Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said today on the CBS show ''Face the Nation.'' He left open the possibility that Mr. Clinton could decide to defer construction of the antimissile system, which would be designed to ward off limited attacks by countries possessing only a few nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>''The practical effect of the failure is that whatever decision the president makes, it will now be easier for the next president to modify,'' one senior official said. Another added: ''Whether you think the whole thing is a good idea or a bad one, we're running out of time'' to make much of a difference while Mr. Clinton is still in office.</p>
        <p>The flaw that doomed the test had nothing to do with the most sophisticated elements of the system, which are supposed to track an incoming missile, differentiate it from a limited number of decoys and intercept it before it hits the United States. Instead, the 130-pound interceptor failed to separate from the booster rocket that would have sent it speeding toward its target. As a result, the ''kill vehicle'' got nowhere near the target.</p>
        <p>The dismal result fueled the arguments of those who say the defense system is a waste of money and will disturb relations with Russia and China. At the other end of the spectrum, it also gave fuel to supporters of the project who argue that Mr. Clinton's plan is insufficiently ambitious.</p>
        <p>''The technological piece of this is not yet in place,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who is a strong supporter of missile defense, also appearing on CBS. ''The cost obviously is not in place. I don't think we've brought our allies on -- I don't think we've handled that very well -- and how we're dealing with the Russians and Chinese on this are important.''</p>
        <p>''So therefore it's only responsible in my opinion to allow the next administration working with the new Congress to start making these decisions,'' he added. Some lawmakers in both parties made the same point today.</p>
        <p>At a news conference a week ago, President Clinton said he expected to make a decision about the next step in ''a few weeks.'' Mr. Berger appeared to extend that deadline today, saying he still expected a decision this summer. He said the Pentagon would have to make a full assessment of what went wrong, based on data beamed back to earth before the interceptor plunged into the ocean.</p>
        <p>One lesson Pentagon planners and the White House may draw from the test is that any missile defense system may require a significantly larger fleet of antimissile rockets than currently planned.</p>
        <p>The Air Force learned this lesson in the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger accident, when military leaders concluded that the shuttle flights would not be frequent enough to lift their spy satellites into space. They shifted the satellite launches back to unmanned rockets.</p>
        <p>But the failure rate of those launches was higher than initially expected.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the arithmetic of offensive and defensive missile launches almost always favors the country initiating an attack. Even if half or more of its rockets are intercepted, an attack can be considered a success.</p>
        <p>But if even a few rockets make it through a defensive shield -- leading to a nuclear disaster that takes thousands of lives -- the shield may well be considered a failure.</p>
        <p>For that reason, several advisers to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, are urging him to support a system that edges back toward President Ronald Reagan's ''Star Wars'' dreams rather than President Clinton's limited defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's plan, one of Mr. Bush's advisers said, was designed to ''come up with the smallest possible program to meet the standard, and it never had a strategic context.'' It was chiefly intended, he argued, to protect Vice President Al Gore from the charge of being too soft on defense.</p>
        <p>Whatever Mr. Clinton decides in coming months, said the adviser, ''we have to go back and look at the strategic logic.''</p>
        <p>That reassessment could also examine the nuclear threat that the system would deter. The failure of this test may only encourage nations like China, which is believed to have only two dozen intercontinental missiles, to vastly increase their arsenals in order to overwhelm any defensive system.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, any new president may have to reassess the nature of the threat from what the State Department previously called ''rogue nations.'' North Korea's recent opening to the South has prompted questions about whether its leaders may be rational enough to be deterred by the prospect of a retaliatory attack -- much as the old Soviet Union was during the cold war.</p>
        <p>Referring to North Korea, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said today: ''The threat is not at all clear to me.''</p>
