        <p>The world's fastest man stood perfectly still, waiting not for the crack of a starter's pistol but for the click of a camera. He wore a black V-neck sweater over his muscled chest and black slacks, and he stood posed against a white brick storefront. Maurice Greene seemed remarkably patient at rest for a man with such kinetic possibility.</p>
        <p>He closed his eyes against the afternoon spring sun, a look of contentment on his face, and a slight weariness, too, that perhaps came from rigorous training or from being the sleep-deprived father of an infant daughter. A passerby approached on the sidewalk and was reluctant to step between Greene and the camera, but Greene opened his eyes and smiled and motioned for the woman to walk past.</p>
        <p>The sprinter's agent, Emanuel Hudson, noticed the polite, small-town gesture and chortled, ''Where do you think you are, still in Kansas?''</p>
        <p>Greene holds the world record at 100 meters, 9.79 seconds, and is seeking to win the 100, 200 and 4x100-meter relay at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The vanity plates on his Mercedes read, ''MO GOLD.'' Four years ago, however, he still lived in Kansas City, Kan., his hometown, where he had won the state 100-, 200- and 400-meter championships as a high school senior in 1993, but where his professional career languished, providing neither public recognition nor financial security.</p>
        <p>He had worked on a loading dock, and according to his current training partner and two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, he had ''held the 10 worst jobs in the fast-food industry.'' He had beaten Carl Lewis once over 100 meters, but when Lewis was asked about the promising young Greene, he responded, ''Who?''</p>
        <p>A nagging hamstring injury ruined Greene's training for the 1996 Olympic trials, and he finished seventh in the quarterfinal round of the 100 meters. Dejected, he drove to the Summer Olympics in Atlanta as a spectator instead of a participant. He said he sat in tears in the Olympic Stadium as Donovan Bailey of Canada won the gold medal and set a world record in 9.84 seconds, telling himself, ''This will never happen again without me.''</p>
        <p>Exactly two months after the Olympic final, on Sept. 27, 1996, Greene arrived in Los Angeles, having loaded his belongings into a sport utility vehicle and driven halfway across the country with his father. He had come to train with the renowned sprint coach John Smith, who like a mechanic took Greene's sprinting style apart and rebuilt it.</p>
        <p>A year later, Greene lowered his personal best in the 100 by a staggering amount in an event in which improvement comes grudgingly by hundredths of a second -- from 10.08 seconds to 9.86 -- equaling Lewis's fastest time in a career that produced nine Olympic gold medals. In the biggest race of the year, at the 1997 world championships in Athens, Greene defeated Bailey and, at the finish line, deliciously stuck his tongue out at the Olympic champion.</p>
        <p>There would be no more fast-food jobs for Maurice Greene, only fast races. Last year, he built a season that only Lewis and Ben Johnson had ever matched in terms of dominant sprinting. Greene lost only one race, and on June 16, 1999, in Athens, he lowered the world record for 100 meters by a stunning five-hundredths of a second to 9.79 -- the largest margin by which the record had ever been reduced.</p>
        <p>Last August in Seville, Spain, Greene won the world championships at 100 meters and at 200 meters, establishing himself as a direct threat in the 200 to the Olympic champion and world record-holder Michael Johnson. The personable Greene is also as voluble as he is fast. If Johnson is Superman, Greene said, then he was Kryptonite.</p>
        <p>Greene's personal best at 200 meters of 19.86 seconds, run in 1997, is faster than Johnson has run at sea level since he shattered the world record in 19.32 seconds at the Atlanta Olympics. They have raced only twice at 200 meters, splitting the races.</p>
        <p>''I give him all the respect he deserves,'' Greene said of Johnson, ''but when he steps on the track, I'm not looking at him as the greatest there is. He's not.''</p>
        <p>Losses and Tired Legs</p>
        <p>Two months ago in Osaka, Japan, Greene posted the fastest 100 in the world this season (9.91). On June 30, he won a race in Rome in 9.97 seconds, breaching 10 seconds for the 27th time in his career, 12 more times than did Lewis, more times than any sprinter in history.</p>
        <p>However, his dominance of a year ago has eluded him. Already, Greene has lost three times at 100 meters this season. Recently he finished fourth in a 100-meter race in Athens and fifth in Glasgow, running 10.54 into a stiff head wind, a languorous time that he had not posted since high school. He returned to Los Angeles, saying his legs were ''dead and sore.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this season, Greene withdrew from two meets, complaining of tired legs. This is not the time of year to be bothered by fatigue, considering that the Olympic track and field trials begin Friday in Sacramento, Calif., and Greene is facing three rounds apiece of the 100 and 200 meters, including his expected showdown at 200 meters with Michael Johnson on July 23, Greene's 26th birthday.</p>
        <p>Smith, his coach, insisted that nothing more serious than jet lag and a few lost pieces of luggage were bothering Greene. He pointed out that from June 24 through July 2, Greene ran five races in nine days on two continents, across 10 time zones and with wild temperature variants, to simulate the rigor of running rounds at the Olympic trials. He said that after some needed rest, Greene would be in his accustomed form at the trials.</p>
        <p>''I'm not concerned at all,'' Smith said. ''There are no injuries. Maurice is healthy and when he's healthy, no one can stop him from doing anything.''</p>
        <p>Although he would become the fastest sprinter in his family, Maurice Greene was not the first. His older brother, Ernest Greene Jr., ran a career best of 10.24 seconds in the 100 and advanced to the semifinals of the 1992 Olympic trials. Maurice's track career began at age 8, when he joined a club coached by Al Hobson, who is now the coach at Kansas City (Kan.) Community College.</p>
        <p>Three times Greene won the Kansas state high school 100- and 200-meter championships at Schlagle High, but poor scores on standardized tests ended any hopes of playing football or running track at a major college.</p>
        <p>From the foundation of Ewing Kauffman, the late owner of the Kansas City Royals baseball team, Greene had received a Project Choice scholarship, which would pay all of his college expenses. This allowed Greene to attend a pair of junior colleges without having to compete on the track teams, saving his speed and avoiding the burnout that collegiate runners often experience by racing too often. He kept training with Hobson and in 1995 he defeated Lewis at the Texas Relays, finished second in the 100 at the national championships in Sacramento and reached the quarterfinals of the world championships in Goteborg, Sweden.</p>
        <p>It was in Sacramento that year that he caught the eye of Hudson, the agent, and Smith, the coach, who together have a management company called Hudson Smith International, also known as Handling Speed Intelligently, or H.S.I., which is a full-service provider for sprinters -- track training, media training, tax planning and investment advice. During a warm-up for the 100 meters at the national championships, a rainstorm occurred, and while most sprinters headed for cover, Greene remained on the track.</p>
        <p>''You could tell he was not afraid,'' Hudson said. ''He was focused on his job and he was not going to melt because of getting water on him. He was someone you had to look out for.''</p>
        <p>A year later, Greene decided to head west to train under Smith -- who still holds the world record in the discontinued 440-yard dash and has coached Olympic sprinters to five gold medals. At the 1999 world championships, athletes in the H.S.I. training group won more gold medals than any country but the United States.</p>
        <p>A Common Drive to Succeed</p>
        <p>Smith and Greene had two things in common that drove them -- an insatiable desire to obliterate conventional wisdom about sprinting and the lack of an Olympic gold medal. Several weeks before the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, Smith had injured a hamstring muscle. Once favored in the Olympic final, he pulled up after only 80 meters. In a sense, Hudson said, Smith is continuing to pursue his own gold medal through the success of the sprinters he coaches.</p>
        <p>''I'm awfully hungry,'' Smith said. Of the elusive gold medal, he added, ''I look up and I still don't have one. It's like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' I keep doing it over and over so I can see if I can get it right.''</p>
        <p>The general assumption about the 100 meters has been that a sprinter can accelerate for only about 60 meters. The winner of a given race is not the athlete who speeds up at the end, but the one who slows down the least. By devising a low, measured drive out of the blocks, Smith seeks to delay the onset of top-end speed so that it can be achieved at 70 or 75 meters, leaving less distance for deceleration and less time for the crumbling of a sprinter's form.</p>
        <p>He has the race broken down to 45 steps, each stride allotted 0.083 of a second on the ground, the feet striking below the hips for maximum efficiency and the spikes raking the track instead of braking. He wants his sprinters to think of their arms and legs as circular levers and themselves as human wheels.</p>
        <p>''Think of it as pushing a bicycle wheel down the street as a kid,'' said Boldon, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 and 200 meters. ''You don't grip the wheel to keep it moving fast, you just tap it quickly on and off.''</p>
        <p>Translating theory to practice, of course, can be difficult on a track, where there is no such thing outdoors as a controlled environment. For months, Greene struggled with Smith's teachings, thinking his way through races instead of relaxing and running. He had come to Los Angeles to run faster and now he was running slower. How could this be? Each day after practice he sometimes stayed at the U.C.L.A. track for an hour or two, frustrated, telling himself, ''Why is this happening to me?''</p>
        <p>As the 1997 national championships in Indianapolis approached, he was dejected, even considering another line of work. But Smith approached him, said, ''It's time to kick it up,'' and the next day Greene won in 9.90 seconds, 18-hundredths of a second faster than his personal best had been entering the season. A month later, he became world champion, lopping another tenth of a second off his personal best.</p>
        <p>''You can't think about running the 100, you have to feel it, and that's what Maurice does,'' said Inger Miller, a training partner of Greene's and the women's world champion at 200 meters. ''He feels it, controls it. He knows the race like the back of his hand. He's very patient with his running.''</p>
        <p>And because he has matched the steroid-discredited time that Ben Johnson ran at the 1988 Summer Olympics and because he has whittled such chunks of time from his personal best, Greene has come under suspicion -- never proved -- that his speed comes from performance-enhancing drugs. It is a charge frequently made against H.S.I. sprinters by other athletes, and one always denied, never documented. The countercharge is that other people are jealous, and not willing to put in the same hard work.</p>
        <p>''Some people believe you can do it with God-given talent, some people believe you have to be on something,'' Greene said. ''You can't change anyone's mind, no matter what. It's sad, but you can't keep worrying about what people think. I'm clean. I hope they do blood testing at the Olympics. I'll be the first in line. I have nothing to hide.''</p>
        <p>Three Gold Medals or Bust</p>
        <p>Like a ballet dancer, Greene rehearses his stride in front of a mirror, monitoring the way he lifts his legs and raises his hands. Sometimes before a big race he has been known to take a piece of paper, write a time faster than he has ever run and store it in his racing spikes. He has everything he did not have four years ago -- a reputation, a world record, a seven-figure income -- everything but an Olympic gold medal. If he does not get three of them in Sydney, he said, ''My career will have a void.''</p>
        <p>''I think I intimidate a lot of people,'' Greene said. ''They get into a race and think they have to do something extra to beat me.''</p>
        <p>His goal this season is to run 9.76 seconds. Smith believes that eventually Greene can run 9.6-something. The coach believes there is no speed limit. He is like a whittler, certain that he can shave five-hundredths of a second here or there, even a full tenth of a second, from Greene's best.</p>
        <p>''Then you can put the record where it should be,'' Smith said, ''and blow everybody's mind.''</p>
