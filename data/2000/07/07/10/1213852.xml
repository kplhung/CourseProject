        <p>The easy availability of medical information on the Internet has been a mixed blessing to both patients and doctors. Well-informed patients now have an appreciation of the complexities of decision-making and can better participate in their own care. But the proliferation of data and detail has also convinced far too many Americans that the management of health is less complex than they had thought.</p>
        <p>By their lights, knowing a drug's therapeutic actions and side effects is qualification enough to treat one's own high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, such a dubious proposition would have been rejected out of hand. But astoundingly, the Food and Drug Administration recently held hearings on the possibility of making a number of potent drugs, including several that are used to treat potentially dangerous chronic conditions, available over the counter. And, of course, several pharmaceutical companies have their own reasons for pushing the agency to allow such a thing. What seems to have been overlooked is something doctors call clinical judgment.</p>
        <p>Hippocrates called medicine ''the Art,'' because he knew that mere information was only the beginning of the study of disease. And despite the advances in the art of healing in the last two and a half millennia, Hippocrates's famous first aphorism remains as true as it ever was: ''Life is short, and the Art is long; the occasion fleeting; experience delusive; judgment difficult.''</p>
        <p>In today's biomedicine, caring for patients requires a doctor's burnished wisdom, which finds its first coalescence during the long period of training and continues to be shaped thereafter in the crucible of focused thought.</p>
        <p>Young doctors are taught to observe dispassionately. They must understand the difference between valid evidence and spurious appearances. They must critically evaluate medical literature, distinguishing between new practices that promise to make lasting contributions to health and new practices that are of fleeting import. Then they must choose a course of treatment that is individualized to each patient's circumstances, yet supported by studies of large groups. Finally, they must monitor treatment meticulously, making changes as necessary.</p>
        <p>It is not information that leads to the best medical care, but judgment. It is in the best interest of all, doctors and non-doctors alike, to recognize the distinction.</p>
        <p>Until now, over-the-counter medications have, by and large, been useful in the treatment of temporary and rather mild problems like headaches, colds and allergies. Does it make any sense at all to expand this category to include drugs that treat conditions like hypertension or elevated cholesterol, which have permanent effects on many organs in the body?</p>
        <p>Every drug has multiple side effects, and the danger is compounded when drugs interact with one another. The possible complications listed in the manufacturer's package inserts are the result of chemical activity, and are not merely nuisances to be put up with or ignored. Before prescribing pharmaceuticals, doctors must consider the benefits and risks for each patient, sometimes based on subtle factors in that individual's physiology or health profile.</p>
        <p>But what happens if a patient self-medicates? As one example, let's say a patient knows he has high blood pressure and decides to treat it himself. If he also has heart disease or diabetes, which are common in patients with hypertension, the medication might change his heart rhythms or create abnormalities in the blood, which could lead to a cardiac arrest.</p>
        <p>Or say a 35-year-old smoker wants birth-control pills. Normally, a doctor would not prescribe pills to this woman, because of an increased incidence of heart attacks. But if the contraceptive is available over the counter, she is free to buy it, regardless of the risk.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A., the drug companies and lawmakers would do well to consult a passage from Hippocrates's Book I of ''Epidemics.'' Meant as an admonition to doctors, it applies equally to those who would make decisions without benefit of clinical judgment: ''As to diseases, make a habit of two things: to help, or at least to do no harm.''</p>
