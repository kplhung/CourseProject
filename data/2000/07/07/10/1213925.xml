        <p>The future arrived early this summer for the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Actually, arrives is the proper tense. At 7 o'clock each morning at the Rangers' training facility in Rye, N.Y., the 19-year-old Pavel Brendl begins his daily two-a-day supervised workouts. He and the Rangers are hoping the sessions will pay off in September, when training camp opens.</p>
        <p>No one in the organization has forgotten last fall, when the ballyhooed Brendl, the fourth choice in the 1999 National Hockey League draft, arrived at camp out of shape after he had already been penciled into the opening night lineup.</p>
        <p>Brendl did not even make the team and was returned to his junior team in Calgary, Alberta. It was an ominous harbinger for the Rangers, who failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season.</p>
        <p>Brendl, a forward who is beginning to fill out his 205-pound frame, has not forgotten how embarrassing last fall was, and he has vowed not to make the same mistake again.</p>
        <p>''The biggest challenge for me is to be in the best shape of my life,'' Brendl said. ''I'm going to be probably in 90 percent better shape than I was last year. And I'll have a way bigger chance of making the team. I'm going to enjoy it more, probably, too.''</p>
        <p>It is doubtful that Brendl is going to enjoy this summer. ''The bottom line is, he's not that self-motivated,'' said Scott Livingston, the Rangers' strength and conditioning coordinator, whose job now is to motivate Brendl. ''I was a little worried that he wouldn't have a great work ethic. But he does. He's not an intense person, but he does work hard.''</p>
        <p>This week, Brendl had the chance to work out with the Rangers' other top prospects. Among them were Jamie Lundmark, who was cleared last Wednesday for full workouts after suffering a season-ending broken right wrist last winter, and Mike Mottau, who is unsigned and wants to impress the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''I just have to make the team,'' Brendl said. ''That's why I'm here so early.''</p>
        <p>Hence those annoying early-morning wake-up calls. ''Pavel's come in with a terrific attitude,'' Don Maloney, the Rangers' assistant general manager, said. ''And he couldn't ask for better training partners.''</p>
        <p>Right beside him, there is Adam Graves, at 32 still as hard working as anyone in the league. Then there is Stefan Cherneski, who is fighting to salvage a career that was once nearly as promising as Brendl's. Cherneski, the Rangers' first-round pick in 1997, has played in only one game since shattering his kneecap in the minor leagues in November 1998.</p>
        <p>''He has not given up hope,'' Maloney said. The Rangers are hoping some of Cherneski's dogged determination rubs off on Brendl.</p>
        <p>''What we're trying to get Pavel to understand is that at some point, we stop holding your hand,'' Maloney said. ''It's always been my experience that the best players in the league are the hardest-working guys.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers were so certain that Brendl would make the team last summer that they allowed him to skip the rookie camp, the one at which Mike York and Kim Johnsson first made strong impressions.</p>
        <p>''The last time, we handled Pavel with kid gloves, thinking he'd waltz into New York and never look back,'' Maloney said. ''We would have changed things had we known. That's why we're taking such an active interest in his training regimen. He learned last year that he couldn't keep up.''</p>
        <p>Maloney was pleased when Brendl joined Hartford of the American Hockey League late in the Calder Cup playoffs and was treated like any other rookie: he helped carry the team's bags after trips and games.</p>
        <p>Maloney eventually sent Brendl back to the Czech Republic before the end of the playoffs, in which Hartford won the championship. Maloney concluded that Brendl was dead tired, and Brendl agreed.</p>
        <p>''Keeping him in Hartford another three weeks would have been beating a dead horse, so we sent him home,'' Maloney said. ''Four weeks later, he was calling us.''</p>
        <p>Brendl disputes that. ''The Rangers invited me here, it was their idea so they could watch me work hard,'' he said. But whoever was responsible for his presence, Brendl did show up and he is working hard.</p>
        <p>Brendl, who will add twice-a-week power-skating sessions to his workout regimen this week, is something of a floater on the ice.  But frustrating though his defensive skills might be, Brendl also has the ability to atone for his mistakes.</p>
        <p>''Pavel has a special talent, one that's in short supply,'' Maloney said. ''He has the ability to score goals and score a lot of them. With that talent, there are some flaws. Running into walls for you, he doesn't do that all the time. But with what you're going to get with this guy, you have to put up with his flaws. Because he can flat-out score.''</p>
