        <p>The Major League Baseball people who created interleague play obviously had the Mets and the Yankees in mind. A few other matchups of geographical rivals as well, perhaps, but Mets-Yankees was the prototype series. The six games in New York this season indeed have been lucrative economically for the teams, and the fans especially found the four weekend games intense and definitely worth watching.</p>
        <p>The Mets, however, want to know who wrote the script that left them losing three of the four games. They salvaged the fourth and final game last night, edging the Yankees, 2-0, at Shea Stadium as Mike Hampton, working on three days' rest instead of his customary four, pitched a strong seven innings and Armando Benitez completed the shutout.</p>

        <p>The Major League Baseball people who created interleague play obviously had the Mets and the Yankees in mind. A few other matchups of geographical rivals as well, perhaps, but Mets-Yankees was the prototype series. The six games in New York this season indeed have been lucrative economically for the teams, and the fans especially found the four weekend games intense and definitely worth watching.</p>
        <p>The Mets, however, want to know who wrote the script that left them losing three of the four games. They salvaged the fourth and final game last night, edging the Yankees, 2-0, at Shea Stadium as Mike Hampton, working on three days' rest instead of his customary four, pitched a strong seven innings and Armando Benitez completed the shutout.</p>
        <p>The Mets came into the series confident that they were on their way up in the National League East standing. They were only a game and a half behind the obstinate Atlanta Braves, and the Braves figured to have as good a chance of losing as winning in their three-game series in Boston. But the Braves won two of the games and doubled their lead over the Mets to three games.</p>
        <p>If it is any consolation to the Mets, the three games at Shea drew 162,583 fans, the largest attendance for a three-game series in Mets history. Last night's attendance, 54,286, was the largest single-game crowd in 30 years.</p>
        <p>The six games, four of which the Yankees won, attracted 330,065 paying customers, and neither the Mets nor the Yankees could ask for anything better than that. Nor could the fans ask for games better than the weekend produced, although Mets fans would be entitled to ask why the Mets did not win more of them.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of the games in this season of inflated offense, all four games were low-scoring affairs. The Yankees won the first three, by scores of 2-1, 4-2 and 4-2. They hardly make that kind anymore.</p>
        <p>But well after the scores of the individual games are forgotten, this season's interborough rivalry will be remembered for the split-stadium doubleheader Saturday and the Roger Clemens pitch that hit Mike Piazza in the head, effectively knocking him out of the last two games and the All-Star Game tomorrow night in Atlanta, where he was to have appeared as the National League's leading vote-getter in the fan ballotting.</p>
        <p>Playing in Piazza's place last night, Todd Pratt contributed two key plays to the victory. In each instance he threw out a runner trying to steal second base, completing a double play that began with a strikeout. In the first inning, Pratt caught Chuck Knoblauch as Derek Jeter struck out and in the eighth he nailed Jose Vizcaino as Knoblauch struck out. Pratt also scored the second run after leading off the seventh inning with a walk.</p>
        <p>The Clemens-Piazza incident continued to produce repercussions, though not on the field. Both teams had wondered if the umpires, intent on keeping peace, would issue a warning to them before the game when the lineups were exchanged at home plate. They did not, but neither Hampton nor Benitez hit a Yankees batter. The Mets, for the moment, were content with winning a game. That need took precedence over retaliation.</p>
        <p>If the Mets had taken a bigger lead, perhaps a pitch might have strayed close to a Yankees batter, but Andy Pettitte and a succession of relief pitchers held the Mets close.</p>
        <p>If the level of heat between the teams subsides, it will do so only because the teams do not play each other again this season. But if Piazza should encounter problems hitting as a result of the beaning, the ill will will last well into the off-season and even carry over to the interleague games next season.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Mets and the Yankees could meet again sooner than next season. Now that would be the ultimate subway series, the World Series.</p>
