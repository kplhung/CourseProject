        <p>A young woman walking from church to an East Side subway station suffered a fractured skull yesterday when she was struck from behind by a man wielding a melon-sized chunk of concrete, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The attack on the woman, Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, occurred minutes after noon on East 29th Street between Lexington Avenue and Park Avenue South.</p>
        <p>It was the latest frightening and seemingly random assault in a public place in Manhattan, and bore uncanny similarities to the attack last November on Nicole Barrett, a young woman from Texas who was attacked in Midtown by a man who smashed her skull with a six-and-a-half-pound paving stone.</p>
        <p>Deborah Brown, who lives directly across the street from the scene of yesterday's attack, came out of her  building moments after Ms. Goldberg was struck. Ms. Brown said an off-duty firefighter, who had leapt from his car as the attack occurred, began helping Ms. Goldberg just as she toppled to the sidewalk in front of Con Edison's 29th Street substation.  Ms. Goldberg was bleeding heavily, she said, and the firefighter was cradling her head and trying to stanch the flow.</p>
        <p>''She was just floored,'' Ms. Brown said. ''But she was conscious, because she was squeezing the hand of this guy who was helping her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg, who moved to New York four years ago and is a waitress at the Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan, was taken to the Bellevue Hospital Center. The authorities  there said she had survived the attack with surprisingly few injuries. Wes Anglin, the hospital administrator on duty, said she was in stable condition last night and described her as alert and oriented.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said the stone struck her directly in the back of the head,  fracturing her skull, and that she also suffered two chipped teeth and lacerations when she fell face-first to the sidewalk. But there was no apparent sign of neurological damage, the authorities said, and Ms. Goldberg was held for observation and to wait for a specialist to interpret the results of a CAT scan.</p>
        <p>Sergeant McInnis also said that although Ms. Goldberg had no recollection of the attack, she had remained conscious throughout the afternoon and was strong enough to be interviewed by detectives. She had also been able to talk by telephone with her father in Madison, Wis.</p>
        <p>''She has talked with many people, but she is unaware of exactly what happened because she was hit from behind,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Barrett, Ms. Goldberg was not robbed. Ms. Brown said her handbag was undisturbed on the ground near where she fell. And, as in the earlier assault, the man who fractured Ms. Goldberg's skull ran away and was not immediately apprehended.</p>
        <p>The authorities would not discuss their investigation in significant detail, but said there were two witnesses to the attack. They were seeking a man, believed to be 20 to 40, who was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and was wearing a bright gold shirt at the time of the attack. They also said the chunk of concrete, apparently from a shattered sidewalk, was recovered on East 29th Street. It weighed three to five pounds, the police said.</p>
        <p>Police supervisors said the investigation's initial focus was on the homeless, because two witnesses said the man who struck Ms. Goldberg appeared disheveled. Detectives were seen late yesterday at the Bellevue Men's Shelter, on First Avenue between East 29th Street and East 30th Street. Bernard Samson, a shelter supervisor, said the police took a man into custody for questioning yesterday about 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The police would not confirm that they had a man in custody, and said the investigation was following other leads.</p>
        <p>''We're not just attacking the homeless, we're looking at many possibilities,'' Sergeant McInnis said.</p>
        <p>Many of the buildings on the block where Ms. Goldberg was attacked have security cameras oriented toward the sidewalks. But the two cameras at the electrical substation are still being installed and were not working yesterday, said Sandy Miller, a Con Edison spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>However, Ms. Miller said, the police had obtained videotape from another building. ''There's an adjacent building with a camera working, and I am told that the police have a videotape of the entire attack,'' she said. The police would not comment about any videotape.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goldberg lives in an apartment building at 333 East 108th Street, the police said. She had lived in Brooklyn until recently and planned to enroll at Columbia University this fall.</p>
        <p>Qiana Mestrich, 23, a professional photographer and a friend from Ms. Goldberg's apartment building, said Ms. Goldberg and her roommate, Melina Berkov-Rojas, had attended Sarah Lawrence College together. She said Ms. Goldberg was an outgoing person and a music fan, following rhythm-and-blues and hip-hop, and said she seemed comfortable living in the city. ''As far as I know, she felt very safe,'' Ms. Mestrich said. ''She felt pretty confident.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday she had attended the 10:30 a.m. service at the Marble Collegiate Church at 29th Street and Park Avenue South, and lingered afterward for coffee and a pastry. Sergeant McInnis said she had planned to pick up a newspaper and return uptown by subway, and was attacked just after leaving the church.</p>
        <p>About 12:10 p.m. she was walking on the sidewalk along the south side of the street when the man slammed the concrete into her head. Ms. Brown, who arrived seconds later, described a disturbing scene: a young woman, stylishly dressed in a blue sleeveless top and black pants, sprawled on the ground, struggling through the disorientation and blood, trying to sit up. The firefighter was holding her head. He was calmly urging her to stay down.</p>
        <p>Sergeant McInnis said that given the severity of the attack, the outcome was surprising. ''She's conscious,'' he said. ''It appears she's going to be fine.''</p>
