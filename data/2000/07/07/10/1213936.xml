        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, trading his suit for a white polo shirt and khakis, left his 10th-floor offices at Board of Education headquarters in Brooklyn yesterday and worked the phones with 27 school employees, urging parents to get their children to summer school today.</p>
        <p>''This is Harold Levy; I'm the chancellor of the school system,'' Mr. Levy, understated in his delivery, told one mother. He then informed her that her daughter, a student at Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, was required to attend summer school, something the girl had somehow overlooked when classes began last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''She knows she needs to go to summer school,'' the chancellor gently said to the mother, who was clearly surprised by the news. ''We sent cards home, and her teacher was told.''</p>
        <p>With widespread attendance problems marring a summer school program heralded as the biggest in New York City history, school officials responded over the last few days with an all-out blitz, using attendance officers and guidance counselors to go door to door and work the phones to reach the parents of the tens of thousands of children who failed to show up for classes last week.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials would not release figures on how many of the 319,167 pupils registered for summer schools failed to attend last week, but Mr. Levy acknowledged that in some schools, the absentee rate hit 40 percent or more.</p>
        <p>''In some schools, that's accurate, and in some schools it's more than that,'' said Mr. Levy, taking a break from the phones -- and from using workable Spanish with parents -- in the fifth-floor offices of the Division of Student Support Services the school board headquarters, at 110 Livingston Street. ''In some schools, it is horrific, and in some schools it's wonderful, and when you go from district to district, you get very different responses.''</p>
        <p>Though a new computer system for tracking attendance is in place, Mr. Levy and other school officials said they wanted to make sure that the data was accurate before its release, planned for Wednesday's school board meeting. ''For the first time, we're in a position to get data on a real-time basis,'' Mr. Levy said.  ''It's the first time that we've ever used it. I want to be sure it's accurate before I start giving out numbers.''</p>
        <p>The big push to solve the attendance problem began on Thursday, after the first absenteeism reports revealed problems citywide for a vaunted program that mandated that 213,530 students attend classes or face the possibility of being held back a year. The other 105,637 registered for the program were encouraged to attend, though not required.</p>
        <p>Attendance officers, working from school headquarters, reached 3,800 households on Thursday and Friday. Calls from school employees in district offices citywide reached thousands more through yesterday. The drive will continue through this week, with attendance officers also knocking on doors.</p>
        <p>Attendance officers making calls yesterday said most of the parents they reached knew about summer school and knew that their children had to attend. Some cited last week's shortened school week -- classes started after the Fourth of July holiday -- as the reason they were holding their children back until this week. Others said they were unsure which day their children were required to show up or said their children had been ill or on vacation.</p>
        <p>Kenneth B. Williams, an attendance officer in Community School District 17 in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, was told that one middle school student had not been going to classes because a death in the family had preoccupied his mother. ''You have my condolences,'' Mr. Williams told the mother. ''Whenever the funeral is over, bring him to the school.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said the mother, like most parents he reached, told him she knew about summer school and pledged that her son would attend. Mr. Williams estimated that of the dozens of calls he had made, 15 percent turned out to be wrong numbers, 35 percent were picked up by answering machines and 10 percent were not answered.</p>
        <p>Zoila Marte, an attendance officer in Upper Manhattan, said many of the parents she had reached had reported that their children did not want to attend summer school. ''Some of the parents are saying that the kids are somewhat reluctant to attend because they failed most of their classes and they're discouraged to attend,'' Ms. Marte said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the hurdles for some parents are not always easily resolved.</p>
        <p>Crystal Harris, for instance, said her son Benjamin Fair, 8, and her nephew Rayshawn Harris, 9, should both be in summer school. But she said she did not know where they were to be enrolled because she was evicted from her Bronx apartment in the spring and is now living in a Brooklyn homeless shelter. Both boys had been attending Public School 5 in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''It's good to have these programs, because they're not at their reading level,'' Ms. Harris said while she watched the boys play basketball in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn yesterday afternoon. ''But trying to take them to the Bronx every day would be trouble, so I got to find out what to do.''</p>
