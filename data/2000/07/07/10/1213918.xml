        <p>Editorial urges Organization of American States to press Pres Alberto K Fujimori to enact democratic reforms and not settle for cosmetic change as it did when Fujimori assumed dictatorial powers in 1992; says it should demand democratization program with measurable benchmarks (S)</p>

        <p>This spring Alberto Fujimori mugged democracy in Peru, retaining his presidency by winning an illegitimate election and runoff vote. Although Peru erupted in protest and foreign governments rebuked him, Mr. Fujimori gambled that his adversaries would not have the stomach to make him hold a truly democratic election. Unfortunately, this cynical strategy is proving to be correct. It is still possible, however, to rebuild the democratic institutions that Mr. Fujimori has destroyed.</p>
        <p>Although election observers from the Organization of American States documented widespread unfairness, Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico led the O.A.S. to acceptance of Mr. Fujimori's victory. The O.A.S. sent its chief, Cesar Gaviria, and the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, to Peru in late June to start working out a democratization program with Mr. Fujimori and his opposition.</p>

        <p>This spring Alberto Fujimori mugged democracy in Peru, retaining his presidency by winning an illegitimate election and runoff vote. Although Peru erupted in protest and foreign governments rebuked him, Mr. Fujimori gambled that his adversaries would not have the stomach to make him hold a truly democratic election. Unfortunately, this cynical strategy is proving to be correct. It is still possible, however, to rebuild the democratic institutions that Mr. Fujimori has destroyed.</p>
        <p>Although election observers from the Organization of American States documented widespread unfairness, Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico led the O.A.S. to acceptance of Mr. Fujimori's victory. The O.A.S. sent its chief, Cesar Gaviria, and the Canadian foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, to Peru in late June to start working out a democratization program with Mr. Fujimori and his opposition.</p>
        <p>The O.A.S. has been there before. After Mr. Fujimori's assumption of dictatorial powers in 1992, the O.A.S. sent a similar mission, which Mr. Fujimori manipulated. He is trying to do so again. He has endorsed the group's goals for reform -- which are worthy but extremely vague -- and set up an unimpressive democracy commission.</p>
        <p>The opposition has asked for the government to take several steps to show its good faith before the opposition is willing to negotiate a specific democratization plan. They include restoring the constitutional court judges Mr. Fujimori fired when they blocked his re-election plans and sacking Vladimiro Montesinos, the sinister intelligence chief. The O.A.S. must not settle for cosmetic change again. It should demand a strict democratization program, with measurable benchmarks, beginning with the removal of Mr. Montesinos from all political influence.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Fujimori lags, the O.A.S. ought to be willing to act, perhaps by instructing members to withdraw their ambassadors, deny visas to Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Montesinos, and vote against certain loans to Peru in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. If the O.A.S. is not willing to sanction Mr. Fujimori for noncompliance, Washington should act on its own.</p>
