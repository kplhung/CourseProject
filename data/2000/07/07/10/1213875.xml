        <p>After a weekend of sharply declining ratings, CBS's ''Big Brother,'' the latest effort in the reality television trend, is falling far short of the phenomenon status reached by two other European imports, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and CBS's ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, without a turnaround in its downward momentum, ''Big Brother'' runs the risk of becoming a hugely expensive flop.</p>
        <p>After a big rating for the show's first episode on Wednesday, ratings dropped precipitously every night for the episodes on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The show lost more than 40 percent of its rating on Thursday night. On Friday, based on ratings for the nation's biggest cities, which approximate what the national rating will be, it dropped an additional 25 percent. And Saturday, again based on those ratings from the biggest cities, ''Big Brother'' lost  20 percent and sank to the status of an also-ran, beaten by a repeat movie on ABC.</p>
        <p>National ratings will be available today. But the trend for the show was clear from the so-called overnight ratings from the biggest cities. On Friday, ''Big Brother'' scored a 6.1 rating. It had scored a 13.9 on Wednesday in the national ratings and an 8 on Thursday. Each national rating point represents just over a million homes.</p>
        <p>The 6.1 overnight rating on Friday was still good enough for ''Big Brother'' to claim leadership in its 8 p.m. slot. But two other shows later that evening, ''Dateline'' on NBC and ''20/20'' on ABC, both scored much higher ratings, an 8.4 and a 7.3 respectively. The other reality shows that became hits as summer series, ''Millionaire'' and ''Survivor,'' have both consistently beaten everything else on the nights they have been on.</p>
        <p>The news for CBS were much worse on Saturday night. The overnight rating for ''Big Brother'' plunged to just a 4.85 for an hourlong episode. (Thursday and Friday's shows were each a half-hour). That was not even good enough to win the time period in the overnight ratings. ''Ground Control,'' a repeat of a movie on ABC, managed a 4.9 for that hour. The movie eventually averaged a 5.3 for two hours. ''Big Brother'' also trailed other shows on later in the evening, a repeat of ''NYPD Blue'' on ABC and ''America's Most Wanted'' on Fox.</p>
        <p>The trend is worrisome for CBS because the network spent $20 million to acquire rights to ''Big Brother,'' which has been a hit in Holland, Spain and Germany, and CBS committed to running the series for 89 nights this summer. Having seen the ratings decline every night for the first four shows, CBS now has 85 more nights to go.</p>
