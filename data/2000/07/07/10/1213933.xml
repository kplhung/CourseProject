      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Nearly every Wimbledon tennis tournament produces one unexpected outcome or another, but this year's was exceptional for the number of dramatic firsts and emotional milestones. Pete Sampras defeated the weather, the clock and a noble and agile opponent in Patrick Rafter to win his 13th Grand Slam singles title, breaking Roy Emerson's longstanding record of 12. Seven of these victories have been achieved on Wimbledon's grass courts, the rest on the hard courts of the United States and Australian Opens, none on the soft clay courts of the French Open -- the only shortcoming in Sampras's otherwise extraordinary career.</p>
        <p>A Rafter victory would not have been surprising, given his riveting semifinal triumph over Andre Agassi. But even if Sampras had not won, this Wimbledon had already been made memorable by the Williams sisters, especially Venus. She defeated her younger sister Serena in the semifinals, then dominated the defending champion, Lindsay Davenport, to become the first African-American woman since Althea Gibson in 1958 to win Wimbledon. On Friday, Venus and Serena became the first African-American team to reach a Wimbledon doubles final, and they may yet win the doubles title in a match delayed until today by the same rainfall that nearly forced a postponement of the men's final.</p>

        <p>Nearly every Wimbledon tennis tournament produces one unexpected outcome or another, but this year's was exceptional for the number of dramatic firsts and emotional milestones. Pete Sampras defeated the weather, the clock and a noble and agile opponent in Patrick Rafter to win his 13th Grand Slam singles title, breaking Roy Emerson's longstanding record of 12. Seven of these victories have been achieved on Wimbledon's grass courts, the rest on the hard courts of the United States and Australian Opens, none on the soft clay courts of the French Open -- the only shortcoming in Sampras's otherwise extraordinary career.</p>
        <p>A Rafter victory would not have been surprising, given his riveting semifinal triumph over Andre Agassi. But even if Sampras had not won, this Wimbledon had already been made memorable by the Williams sisters, especially Venus. She defeated her younger sister Serena in the semifinals, then dominated the defending champion, Lindsay Davenport, to become the first African-American woman since Althea Gibson in 1958 to win Wimbledon. On Friday, Venus and Serena became the first African-American team to reach a Wimbledon doubles final, and they may yet win the doubles title in a match delayed until today by the same rainfall that nearly forced a postponement of the men's final.</p>
        <p>In that event, Sampras was not to be denied. Despite occasional shakiness in his normally lethal serve, he began to return Rafter's serve with increasing precision and power. By the fourth set, Sampras was clearly the more confident of the two, and Rafter had little to offer in return. This should not be the end of it for Sampras. Though he seems to have been dominating the game forever, he is still only 28 years old.</p>
