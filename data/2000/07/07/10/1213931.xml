        <p>The Jets, who are trying to sign their four first-round draft picks before training camp opens on Thursday, reached agreement yesterday with their top two picks, defensive end Shaun Ellis and linebacker John Abraham.</p>
        <p>Ellis and Abraham, who are expected to compete for starting roles, will sign today. Ellis, from Tennessee, and Abraham, from South Carolina, were selected by the Jets with the 12th and 13th overall picks. They are represented by the same agent, Ricky Lefft.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Chad Pennington, who was selected 18th over all, is the only Jet pick still unsigned. Tight end Anthony Becht, the 27th pick, signed earlier.</p>
        <p>Ellis's contract is worth $8.175 million, with an annual average of $1.635 million. Abraham's deal is worth $7.555 million with an average of $1.51 million.</p>
        <p>The deals are structured to give Ellis and Abraham plenty of upfront money and also job security by guaranteeing the third and fourth years of the five-year contracts.</p>
        <p>That structure also helps the Jets, who need room under the salary cap to sign Pennington.</p>
