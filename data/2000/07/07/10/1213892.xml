        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>A skin infection, possibly begun by an insect bite, left my inner thigh swollen and sensitive and finally forced me to visit a dermatologist.</p>
        <p>An inveterate cyclist, I hopped on my Trek trail bike and pedaled to 63rd Street and Central Park West. After locking the bike to a street sign, I popped into the doctor's office. The doctor started me on an antibiotic, but unfortunately, also had to lance the area and could not anesthetize it before making the incision.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>A skin infection, possibly begun by an insect bite, left my inner thigh swollen and sensitive and finally forced me to visit a dermatologist.</p>
        <p>An inveterate cyclist, I hopped on my Trek trail bike and pedaled to 63rd Street and Central Park West. After locking the bike to a street sign, I popped into the doctor's office. The doctor started me on an antibiotic, but unfortunately, also had to lance the area and could not anesthetize it before making the incision.</p>
        <p>It was a procedure I hope never to experience again. Afterward, bandaged and drained, I prepared to leave and remembered I had come on my bike. The thought of cycling home the way I felt left me deflated.</p>
        <p>I needn't have worried. My bike was gone, along with the Kryptonite lock that was too strong for Superman but not for a resourceful New Yorker. I was spared the indignity and discomfort of trying to return home on my bike. Is this a great city or what?</p>

        <p>During a recent windstorm, two big limbs from a tree fell and shattered the windshield of a car owned by one of Harriet Bailer's neighbors. Ms. Bailer called the Fire Department, and when the trucks arrived, was surprised to see the neighbor hugging one of the young firemen and kissing him on both cheeks. ''She's really happy to see us,'' the other, equally surprised fireman said.</p>
        <p>The neighbor explained her exuberance. ''It's my nephew!'' she yelled with joy.</p>
        <p>''Some days my city feels like a small town to me,'' Ms. Bailer said.</p>
        <p>Nineteen-year-old Joe Augusten, who lives in Phillips, Me., sent this e-mail message to Gwen Reiman, his grandmother, after a one-day visit to New York with three companions:</p>
        <p>Leave Boston 5:15 a.m.</p>
        <p>Arrive between Second and Third Avenue on 41st Street in parking lot 8:40 a.m.</p>
        <p>Walk to Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>Walk up to Central Park (lie down on grass for half an hour and sleep).</p>
        <p>Walk to Times Square (eat lunch).</p>
        <p>Walk to World Trade Center (many breaks in between).</p>
        <p>Walk to Statue of Liberty ferry.</p>
        <p>Walk to Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
        <p>Walk to middle of Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
        <p>Walk back to 41st Street (arrive around 5 p.m. We are absolutely dead.).</p>
        <p>Drive up Third Avenue to 96th Street, take F.D.R. north.</p>
        <p>Go to toll bridge, go through toll, so happy we made it out of city we go right instead of left, work our way around and get back to I-95, so not too bad.</p>
        <p>Drive to New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>Go to beach and sleep till about 8 or 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>Drive back to Boston. Arrival midnight.</p>
        <p>It was an awesome day, New York City is huge. My legs have never felt this tired in my life. I'm beat and have to go to bed. Love.</p>
        <p>Chris and Hilary Wendel and friends recently took a taxi from the Upper West Side to Brooklyn. During the course of the journey, someone in the party mentioned that he was hungry. Before they knew what was happening, the Egyptian driver pulled over on Atlantic Avenue, got out of the cab and soon returned with mango drinks, baklava and other Mideast snacks. He refused payment, Mr. Wendel said, apparently happy to have his passengers experience Egyptian hospitality. Needless to say, the tip was generous.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>My mother's neighborhood (83rd Street and Columbus Avenue) has changed in the 50 years she has lived there, but the one constant has been Zingone Brothers, a small family grocery store on Columbus. Angelo and Nick Zingone, who started working in the family business as teenagers, are still there, and the store has always been more than a grocery for my family. For me, it has always been a place where everyone knows your name and the last surviving link to the old neighborhood. When my father lost his sight, he would test his independent living skills by walking to Zingone's for a loaf of bread, and more often than not, they would insist that a young son walk him back home.</p>
        <p>After fracturing her hip and undergoing several surgeries, my mother recently had an appointment at the Hospital for Special Surgery. She arranged for transportation with her usual car service. She noticed as she left her building that traffic was backed up but a car was waiting out front. Her 92-year-old friend helped her into the car and directed the driver where to take them.</p>
        <p>When they arrived, the friend tendered a $20 bill, but the driver refused it. He was Nick Zingone's son, who had been sitting in traffic when my mother and her friend suddenly got into the car and told him their destination. A true Zingone, he thought nothing of giving her a lift all the way across town.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>As I took my seat on an uptown A train recently I heard, behind me and farther down the car, a voice singing. A woman in front of me turned to look, her head snapped back and after she took a second look, she glanced at a man sitting near her and smiled.</p>
        <p>''What's the big deal?'' I thought. ''Hasn't she ever heard singing on the subway before?''</p>
        <p>When several other passengers did a double take, I turned to see what was attracting the attention. The man, singing a Western song, was wearing a cowboy hat and chaps, and between his legs was a plastic horse head on a long pole. A second person, crouched behind him, had a piece of fabric draped over his body, decorated to look like a horse's rear. Together they galloped down the aisle, debarked at the next stop and kept singing as they trotted along the platform.</p>

        <p>THE PARK AT DAWN</p>
        <p>Central Park at 5:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>Is full of Type A people</p>
        <p>Running, biking, Rollerblading</p>
        <p>To be thin, to be strong, to get an edge.</p>
        <p>To work off some aggression</p>
        <p>So that later, at the office.</p>
        <p>They will only bark, not bite.</p>
        <p>The park is serene at 5:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>You can hear the birds tweeting,</p>
        <p>The tweeting that is later obscured</p>
        <p>By fleets of taxis and hansom cabs</p>
        <p>And hordes of kids and boom boxes.</p>
        <p>It almost hurts, it is so loud and sweet.</p>
        <p>When the morning rigor is complete</p>
        <p>The Type A person exits,</p>
        <p>Another Type A arriving at 6:30 a.m. is jealous.</p>
        <p>Someone else has finished and she is only starting.</p>
