        <p>In a runoff election shunned by opposition candidates and international observers, a handful of Haitians voted today for the few legislative and local offices that were not already won by  Lavalas bloc, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
        <p>The low turnout came after opposition parties and international groups protested questionable first-round results on May 21, which they said relied on an inaccurate vote count that gave outright victories to many Lavalas candidates, including 18 of 19 Senate seats. When Haitian officials refused to reconsider requests that eight of those seats be determined in a runoff, opposition parties and observer groups refused to take part.</p>
        <p>''We do not think they should allow the process to go forward as if nothing had happened,'' Orlando Marville, the leader of the Organization of American States electoral mission, said on Friday. ''Fundamentally, if they say they are not going to change it, we cannot accept it as valid. This changes the whole nature of the elections. We are at the position where to observe the elections would send the wrong signal, which we do not want to do.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the first round, when thousands of voters lined up for hours, today's election held little excitement or suspense. In many cities, including Port-au-Prince, the capital, there were no runoff elections because all elections had been decided, in the first round.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, people assumed Lavalas would continue its sweep. In Saint-Marc, polling station workers spent the early morning dozing while waiting for voters to trickle in. Many residents of this town two hours north of Port-au-Prince said they were not bothering to take part because they felt the process had been set up to favor Lavalas.</p>
        <p>''What election?'' said Marcial D'Orleans, an undertaker who spent the morning with some friends sitting in the plaza outside city hall. ''People heard on television and radio that the first round was a mess. Only one party won. So people decided not to vote anymore.''</p>
        <p>The elections represented a crucial step in restoring a functioning government to Haiti, which has not had a Parliament since early 1999. About $500 million in international aid had been blocked because there was no legislature to pass authorizations to rebuild roads or other crumbling public works.</p>
        <p>The vote was also a test of the drawing power of Mr. Aristide, who was barred by law from running for a second consecutive term in the last election but is expected to run again for president in November without any significant opposition. His party's sweep of not only the legislature, but also mayoralties and other local offices in Haiti's biggest cities, would prevent his administration from being mired in the legislative and political challenges that have crippled the current government of his protege, President Rene Preval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, was ousted in a military coup seven months after he took office in 1991 and was restored to power by an American-led invasion force in 1994. He remains the country's most popular politician.</p>
        <p>More than 29,000 candidates and 60 percent of the nation's 4 million voters took part in the first round, and international observers said there had been no gross irregularities in the voting. Observers said many voters had chosen Lavalas, which had mounted an aggressive campaign.</p>
        <p>But soon after the polls closed, opposition candidates complained that armed groups linked to Lavalas had burst into some polling places and intimidated workers or made off with ballot boxes. The next day, about 30 opposition party members were arrested by the police on charges of inciting to riot or disturbing the peace with claims of fraud. The charges were later dropped.</p>
        <p>The crisis continued when the Provisional Electoral Council released partial results that gave Lavalas 18 of the 19 Senate seats at stake. Leon Manus, the council president, refused to sign off on those results and fled the country, saying he feared for his life. He said he had been under extreme pressure to confirm the results, which had been determined by counting only the votes received by the top four candidates for each post.</p>
        <p>''The Haitian people turned out in large numbers because they believed in the process, and that was encouraging,'' said one Haitian who was an observer during the first round. ''What is discouraging is they were told their gesture did not count.''</p>
        <p>Lavalas supporters, however, said the charges were being fueled by opposition candidates who did have enough support to win at the polls.</p>
        <p>''Lavalas is strong here,'' said Charles Deceres, a Lavalas supporter in Saint-Marc. ''Manus resigned because the other parties insisted they had people behind them, but they were wrong.''</p>
        <p>Gerard Pierre Charles, the leader of the Organization of People in Struggle, a Lavalas splinter group that had led the legislative opposition, said the government's refusal to let the contested seats be determined in a runoff was but the latest outrage in an electoral process that had been dominated by Lavalas. He said Lavalas supporters held many posts at polling places and had often taken to the streets in protests after the first round, blocking traffic, burning tires and promising to disrupt the country if their party did not win.</p>
        <p>''A positive aspect of this is it helped put clearly the antidemocratic project of Aristide,'' Mr. Pierre Charles said. ''These were not elections, this was a hidden coup. This electoral parody brings about an absolute control of the state. So we fall into a totalitarian government with one party rule.''</p>
        <p>That prospect worried some residents of Saint-Marc, even as they sat out the elections. ''If the problems continue, we will take a boat to Miami,'' said Jean Eric, a mason. ''Here there is only one group eating all the food: Lavalas.''</p>
