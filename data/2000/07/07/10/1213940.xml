        <p>MANHATTAN: OPSAIL PROTEST  The organizers of OpSail should apologize to Upper Manhattan spectators who missed most of the Hudson River parade because a group of tall ships turned around on Tuesday before reaching the George Washington Bridge, several city and state politicians said yesterday. City Councilmen Guillermo Linares and Bill Perkins and State Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat suggested at a news conference that the ships skipped the trip farther north because of a lack of respect for neighborhoods where many blacks and Latinos live. An OpSail spokesman declined to comment yesterday, but officials have said the ships turned around at 127th Street to make sure they had enough time to dock safely before the tide changed.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: HOSPITAL DEEMED NEGLIGENT  A man who was left a brain-damaged quadriplegic has been awarded $41 million by a Brooklyn jury that found Long Island College Hospital negligent in not ordering a CAT scan when he went to the emergency room on Jan. 31, 1991, complaining of a severe headache. While waiting to be treated, the man, David Fellin, went into a coma; surgery performed seven hours after he was admitted revealed a ruptured brain aneurysm. Lawyers for Mr. Fellin said a CAT scan could have detected the internal bleeding. The award was announced on Friday.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: INCREASE IN DEER  Scientists estimate that one million white-tailed deer are now roaming New York State, while the numbers of their main predator -- the human hunter -- are on the decline. There were 493,000 hunting licenses issued in 1998, down from a high of 700,000 in 1981. The State Department of Environmental Conservation has scheduled forums to examine the future of deer hunting in the state.</p>

        <p>LONG BRANCH: BEACH DEBRIS  Medical waste and other debris washed up on several Jersey Shore beaches on Thursday and Friday, but officials said the incidents were isolated and were not cause for concern. ''Floatables and plastics'' washed up on Friday on some beaches at Seven Presidents Park in Long Branch, probably caused by exceptionally high and low tides over the last several days, according to Mary Montainer, a park ranger. She added that the Long Branch Health Department had determined that the waste had not endangered swimmers. But about 15 syringes and other waste washed up on two oceanfront beaches in Manasquan on Thursday, The Asbury Park Press reported. And about a mile off Manasquan Inlet on Friday, boaters spotted a mile-long garbage slick and alerted the Coast Guard.</p>

        <p>GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP: HOTEL HOSTAGES  The police have charged a Camden man and a 14-year-old boy with breaking into a room at the Howard Johnson Express Inn here, raping a woman in front of her two young sons and holding the family hostage, the police said. The family escaped after about 30 minutes, but the man and boy barricaded themselves in the room for three hours before surrendering about 2:30 a.m. yesterday, the police said. Arrested were the man, Ernest Buffaloe, 23, and a Gloucester Township boy whose name was not released. They face several charges, including robbery, aggravated assault, sexual assault, kidnapping and cruelty to a child.</p>

        <p>STAMFORD: MOSQUITO MENACE  Neighbors of a section of Metro-North Railroad say a garbage-strewn area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Last year, a mosquito-borne strain of encephalitis sickened 72 people in New York, 7 of whom died. The site, an area about 50 feet wide between the tracks of the New Haven line and the New Canaan branch, contains large pools of standing water, tires, brush and other debris. Railroad officials say the area is being cleaned up.</p>
