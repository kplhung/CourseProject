        <p>If present trends continue, the United States, and New York State in particular, could face the most serious domestic energy crisis since the 1970's, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, in a news conference at his Manhattan office, said a report by his office showed that the nation's inventories of crude oil, natural gas and home heating oil are at or near a 24-year low, while the demand for them and for electricity is rising. That, he said, could indicate that an  energy emergency lies ahead.</p>

        <p>If present trends continue, the United States, and New York State in particular, could face the most serious domestic energy crisis since the 1970's, Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer, in a news conference at his Manhattan office, said a report by his office showed that the nation's inventories of crude oil, natural gas and home heating oil are at or near a 24-year low, while the demand for them and for electricity is rising. That, he said, could indicate that an  energy emergency lies ahead.</p>
        <p>''We could have a mild summer and a mild winter, which would take much of the pressure off our inventories,'' Mr. Schumer said, but added, ''All it would take is a somewhat unseasonably hot summer or cold winter to push us over that line.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer has called on President Clinton to create a national energy commission to study energy use and production nationwide. The presidential commission is necessary, he said, because Congress is divided on how to handle energy issues.</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman, P. J. Crowley, said that the Clinton administration had put before Congress a number of proposals to deal with the energy situation, but that Mr. Schumer's ideas were welcome.</p>
        <p>Stu Nagurka, a spokesman for the federal Department of Energy, said that the department had not yet reviewed the senator's report but that it planned to do so and welcomed the attention Mr. Schumer was bringing to energy issues.</p>
        <p>Consumers have seen the effects of the energy supply most immediately in the price of gasoline. In New York State, prices have surged to an average of $1.64 per gallon, according to a survey by AAA.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said New York was in a precarious position because of the state's reliance on home heating oil and the generally high price of gasoline throughout the state.</p>
        <p>According to State Public Service Commission reports, over the last three years, New York City's peak electricity demand has increased by 700 megawatts, which equals the output of an entire electricity plant. Power failures are likely during the summer because of the limited capacity of transmission wires to import energy from other regions and the inability to put new generating plants in the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer also proposed mileage regulations for sport-utility vehicles, which represent 40 percent of all new car sales in the country. The regulations would require manufacturers to build sport utility vehicles  to meet miles-per-gallon standards, to be determined. Since the vehicle is now classified as a truck, its mileage is not regulated.</p>
        <p>Robert Sinclair Jr., a spokesman for the New York AAA, said, ''Anything that leads to better gas mileage being had by any and all vehicles is a positive step forward.''.</p>
        <p>If the president accepted his proposal for an energy commission, Senator Schumer said, he would like to see members represent energy-producing states like Alaska and Texas as well as consumer and environmental groups.</p>
        <p>The senator also said he supported using alternative energy sources like solar energy, giving tax breaks to new electricity plants that use clean natural gas and promoting energy conservation efforts.</p>
