        <p>In a move to raise sales of its ketchup, H.J. Heinz plans to introduce a new version today that will be bright green and is intended to appeal to children.</p>
        <p>Numerous focus-group sessions with about 1,000 children led company executives to conclude that ketchup in a new color would encourage its more liberal use on food. In addition to the green ketchup, Heinz has also come up with a curvaceous bottle in plastic it says is softer and easier for children to squeeze. The nozzle emits a fine stream, compared with previous containers, enabling children to write their names on their food or play Jackson Pollock -- parents permitting.</p>

        <p>In a move to raise sales of its ketchup, H.J. Heinz plans to introduce a new version today that will be bright green and is intended to appeal to children.</p>
        <p>Numerous focus-group sessions with about 1,000 children led company executives to conclude that ketchup in a new color would encourage its more liberal use on food. In addition to the green ketchup, Heinz has also come up with a curvaceous bottle in plastic it says is softer and easier for children to squeeze. The nozzle emits a fine stream, compared with previous containers, enabling children to write their names on their food or play Jackson Pollock -- parents permitting.</p>
        <p>''It's empowered them in a way that they have always desired but haven't had an opportunity, until now,'' said Deb Magness, a Heinz spokeswoman. ''It's a ketchup they can call their own.''</p>
        <p>The ketchup, called EZ Squirt, is fortified with Vitamin C and will start appearing in stores in October, she said. Despite the color, the vitamins and the packaging, ''there is no taste difference,'' she added.</p>
        <p>With sales of packaged food showing little growth the last several years, companies are trying all sorts of strategies to help their businesses to grow. While new products can increase sales, at least in the short run, many analysts believe Heinz is likely to acquire another company so that it can become larger and more diversified. In addition to ketchup, Heinz also makes pet food, tuna fish, pickles, private-label soup and other products.</p>
        <p>A wave of consolidation the last three months has linked Bestfoods with Unilever and Nabisco with Philip Morris, increasing the pressure on smaller companies like Heinz to eventually combine forces with others so that they can be forceful players in the global supermarket business.</p>
