        <p>Nine days and hundreds of kilometers after it started, the Tour de France really begins Monday, and storm signals are flying. That is not metaphor: the weather forecast when the bicycle race enters the Pyrenees is for rain, snow, fog, winds up to 37 miles an hour and temperatures as low as 43 degrees.</p>
        <p>In similar conditions in 1996, the jewel Alpine stage was shortened in fear that the racers would be endangered if they tried to traverse the Galibier peak in howling winds after a freak snowfall. Few daily stages have been curtailed or canceled because of bad weather since the Tour began in 1903.</p>
        <p>Even before the grim prediction from the French Weather Service, which is often inaccurate, the 10th stage in the three-week Tour shaped up as a storm. ''On paper, the Tour opens July 10,'' Lance Armstrong, the defending champion, said before the actual start, July 1.</p>
        <p>After the long period of wandering around the flatlands and small hills of western France, the race will begin to move steeply up and the outlines of its final shape will emerge. Except for the two time trials, most of the favorites have ridden anonymously in the pack until now.</p>
        <p>Jan Ullrich, Marco Pantani, Abraham Olano, Alex Zulle, Laurent Jalabert, Fernando Escartin, Laurent Dufaux, Richard Virenque, Bobby Julich and Armstrong -- none of the contenders' names figured today in the results of the ninth stage.</p>
        <p>Instead the major names were Paolo Bettini, Geert Verheyen, Jose Angel Vidal and Didier Rous, a breakaway group that barely held off the main pack of chasers to finish in that order after a 112-mile rolling stage in gloomily overcast and breezy weather that may look like paradise Monday.</p>
        <p>Bettini, an Italian with Mapei, was timed in 4 hours 29 minutes 6 seconds, a speed of about 25 m.p.h. The stage to Dax began in Agen, an occasional Tour stop and the prune capital of the world.</p>
        <p>Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom, continued in the overall leader's yellow jersey ahead of Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole, and Marc Wauters, a Belgian with Rabobank.</p>
        <p>Most of those names should be missing from the news Monday. Weather permitting, the big boys should be back.</p>
        <p>''That first day in the mountains can set the tone for the rest of the Tour,'' Bobby Julich, the American leader of the Credit Agricole team, said this morning. ''It's time to sink or swim.''</p>
        <p>Where do the winners of the last three Tours stand before the first of five days of steep climbing, spread over the next eight days, in the Pyrenees, the Midi and the Alps?</p>
        <p>Armstrong, the Texan who leads the United States Postal Service team and trails the leader by nearly six minutes, appears to be in splendid position. ''I'm feeling good, though how good I'll know Monday night,'' he said Saturday. ''The team hasn't had to work hard the first week and we're ready.''</p>
        <p>He seemed relaxed and confident, yet on edge, like a man eager for battle. Glancing at the French sports newspaper l'Equipe, Armstrong read aloud an item in which German reporters had been polled about the eventual winner. Eighteen voted for Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom and the champion in 1997, 10 for Armstrong and 1 for Zulle, the Swiss leader of Banesto, who was second last year.</p>
        <p>''Ten's enough,'' Armstrong said with a smile. Although he will not put it into words, he regards Ullrich as his main rival and proceeded to discuss the German's weight, an annual problem. Armstrong said he thought that Ullrich still weighed about 2 kilograms, or 4.4 pounds, too much.</p>
        <p>''If I were 2 kilos over, I wouldn't be a factor,'' he said. ''Two kilos over the course of a day of climbing, that's plenty. One kilo is too much.''</p>
        <p>He may be wrong about Ullrich's condition, however. To others, the German, who is six and a half minutes behind, looks fit. The spare tire around his middle that was evident in races last month has melted in the Tour.</p>
        <p>''His head is good,'' said Telekom's directeur sportif, Walter Godefroot. ''That's where his problems start, in his morale. And now his morale is strong.''</p>
        <p>The winner of the 1998 Tour, Marco Pantani, the Italian leader of the Mercatone Uno team, has also been troubled since he was ousted from the Giro d'Italia last year for failing a blood test that indicated the use of illegal drugs. But he too has seemed restored in this Tour.</p>
        <p>The best climber of the three champions, Pantani will get his chance to start reducing an 11-minute deficit Monday, weather permitting.</p>
