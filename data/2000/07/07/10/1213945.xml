        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''America, Seen Through the Filter of Race''(Op-Ed, July 2):</p>
        <p>A black multimillionaire recounts an incident in which a white plumber mistook him for a stable hand because he was wearing jeans in his own stables.</p>
        <p>The next day another article (Metropolitan Diary, July 3) tells the story of a woman who changed from blue jeans to a blue suit to eat lunch at the Plaza Hotel, only to discover that she is the only guest wearing a suit. Consequently, she is mistaken for an employee. I myself, an Ivy-educated middle-aged businessman, was recently mistaken for a messenger, because, as my wife says, I often go to work ''dressed like a janitor.''</p>
        <p>I wonder if some blacks have an unrealistic view of how successful whites live. Whatever advantages one has does not grant blanket immunity to life's inevitable insults. Moreover, what right do any of us have to object to being mistaken for people doing honest and honorable work?</p>
