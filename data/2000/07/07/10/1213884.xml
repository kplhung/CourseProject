        <p>Johnson Controls, the auto parts manufacturer, will begin a tender offer on Monday for the shares of the Ikeda Bussan Company, a Nissan Motor Company affiliate that is best known for making premium-quality car seats.</p>
        <p>The deal is another strike at the heart of the tightly knit cluster of businesses linked to Nissan, which has been dismantling a cumbersome and costly corporate empire in an effort to return to financial health. It may also herald a rush of mergers and acquisitions in Japan's highly fragmented auto parts industry.</p>
        <p>Johnson Controls, based in Milwaukee, said today that it would offer 120 yen a share -- equivalent in total to about $100 million -- to buy all the outstanding shares of Ikeda Bussan. It would also assume $85 million in debt. Shares of Ikeda Bussan closed here on Friday at 118 yen.</p>
        <p>The two companies share joint ventures in Europe and the United States and so are not strangers.</p>
        <p>''We believe this acquisition will bring positive benefits to Ikeda Bussan, Nissan and Johnson Controls,'' James Keyes, Johnson's chairman and chief executive, said.</p>
        <p>Nissan has already agreed to sell its 36.9 percent stake in the company to Johnson, and people close to the negotiations said Johnson had been negotiating with other big stockholders and was likely to attract a significant portion of the outstanding shares.</p>
        <p>The French automaker Renault, which bought 37 percent of Nissan last year, has provided new impetus for Nissan to slim down. Ikeda is the latest in a string of Nissan affiliates to be sold, including its aerospace unit and its stake in Fuji Heavy Industries. Nissan has raised about 100 billion yen, or about $935 million.</p>
        <p>Ikeda Bussan, which had revenue of 134.7 billion yen, or $1.25 billion, in the fiscal year ending in March, has suffered because of its heavy reliance on Nissan, whose production has fallen amid declining sales.</p>
