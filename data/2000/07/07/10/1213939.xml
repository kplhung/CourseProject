        <p>Mike Piazza got up off the mat and came up swinging -- verbally -- at Roger Clemens last night. To the Mets' catcher, Clemens committed an unconscionable act on Saturday when he gave Piazza a concussion with a fastball to the head.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could remember him as a great pitcher, as a Cy Young award winner,'' Piazza said. ''But I know I can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Piazza missed last night's 2-0 triumph over the Yankees, and he will stay home and rest instead of going to tomorrow's All-Star Game in Atlanta, where he was scheduled to be the starting catcher for the National League.</p>
        <p>He said he felt fine, but also that he was groggy and had a headache. Piazza said he would have a magnetic resonance imaging test very soon to see if the beaning inflicted any damage to his brain. ''I consider myself very fortunate that I have at least a little bit of my faculties today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Piazza prepared some comments before answering questions from the news media last night, and he said it would be the only time he would address the incident. He had plenty to say, and in doing so gave voice to a rivalry that now may be more intense between the teams than it is between the fans of those teams.</p>
        <p>''It's about the team,'' said Mets General Manager Steve Phillips. ''It's not exclusively about an individual.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday Phillips forbade the Yankees from using the weight room in the Mets' locker room, a facility normally shared by the teams. He also scrapped plans to have the Mets All-Stars Al Leiter and Edgardo Alfonzo and their families fly on the Yankees' postgame charter to Atlanta for the All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if things are ever over,'' Phillips said. ''Guys have long memories in baseball.''</p>
        <p>Piazza was upset not only at Clemens but also at other Yankees who said Clemens was only trying to pitch inside when Piazza was hit in the second inning.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was definitely intentional,'' Piazza said. ''I could respect the fact that he's throwing inside. I could respect the fact of getting hit, getting hit in the ribs or the body. I know that's part of the game. I accept that and I don't have any problem with that. But I feel there's a difference between that and almost ending my career.''</p>
        <p>Clemens responded by saying he had no reaction to Piazza's comments. He repeated what he said after Saturday's game, a 4-2 Yankees victory in the second game of their day-night doubleheader. ''I wasn't trying to hit him,'' Clemens said. ''I was trying to pitch him inside.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who has seven hits, including three homers, in 12 at-bats against Clemens, was not buying that.</p>
        <p>''He's got no remorse,'' said Piazza, who added he had no interest in accepting Clemens's phone call on Saturday. ''I'm kind of flattered, in a weird way, because he's trying to tell me the only way to get me out is to try to hurt me.''</p>
        <p>Piazza and Mets Manager Bobby Valentine both said they felt Clemens would not have thrown such a pitch at Shea Stadium, where Clemens would have had to hit.</p>
        <p>''I really can't say I have respect for him right now,'' Piazza said. ''Roger has very good control. I think he only walked one guy during the game. If the shoe fits, that's the way it is.</p>
        <p>''Also, I want to say this: I thought sometime down the line in my career maybe I could have been a designated hitter. But I think that's probably not a good thing for baseball. I think that if he knew he had to come up the next inning, he probably would have been a little more careful.''</p>
        <p>Valentine said he did not remember if Clemens threw at any Texas Rangers when Valentine managed there -- ''We beat him a lot, I remember that,'' Valentine said -- but noted that Clemens was protected by the presence of a designated hitter.</p>
        <p>''You are responsible for your actions and the consequences,'' Valentine said. ''In that American League situation, there's very little responsibility and very little consequences. So your teammate gets hit in the butt by an 86-mile-per-hour fastball.''</p>
        <p>That is what the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch did to Tino Martinez, the first Yankee he faced Saturday after Piazza was hit.</p>
        <p>Piazza, of course, was hit in a far more dangerous area, and he wondered if it would have long-term implications on his career. Piazza is one of baseball's best hitters, but he said he could not be sure how he would be affected by the incident.</p>
        <p>''I know it's going to take me a little while to get comfortable in the box,'' he said. ''You have to deal with it. I've been hit before and you just put it behind you. You cannot do the job if you're not completely comfortable in the box. If you have one ounce of anxiety or fear, you're not going to play well.''</p>
