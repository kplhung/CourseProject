        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''As U.S. Debate Intensifies, Pay for Teachers Rises 3%'' (news article, July 5):</p>
        <p>While the difference in earnings between teaching and other professions may seem sufficient to explain America's teacher shortage, a number of other factors contribute to the problem.</p>
        <p>We need a stronger national effort encouraging college students to enter teaching for its nonfinancial benefits. Americorps and similar programs fill this void to some extent, but more active endorsement of the teaching profession is required.</p>
        <p>Young pre-career students are often idealistic. However, teaching is infrequently considered as a profession not only because of the low pay but also because college students do not gain proper exposure to teaching as a career while still in school.</p>
