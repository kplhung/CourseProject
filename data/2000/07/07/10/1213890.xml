        <p>One week after Chechen rebels killed 33 Russian soldiers in a wave of truck-bomb attacks, two smaller bombs killed seven civilians today in southern Russian provinces close to Chechnya.</p>
        <p>No one claimed responsibility for the bombings, but the locations strongly suggested ties to secessionist guerrilla forces inside Chechnya, who said last week that they intended to carry their campaign outside the war zone.</p>
        <p>Five people died and 17 more were wounded in the largest blast, in the central market at Vladikavkaz, the same market at which a huge explosion killed 50 people in March 1999.</p>
        <p>The city, the capital of North Ossetia, about 30 miles from the Chechnya border, is a stopping point for Russian troops and commanders involved in the Chechen conflict. President Vladimir V. Putin met with his military commanders in North Ossetia last week to demand greater security after the truck bombings.</p>
        <p>The independent NTV television network said the bomb had been stuffed with metal fragments and apparently contained about a half-pound of TNT. The government-run RTR network said the bomb had been hidden under a car near the market.</p>
        <p>A second explosion, apparently a bomb hidden in a purse, killed two shopkeepers and wounded two other people in the Black Sea port of Rostov-on-Don. One of the victims was killed instantly when he tried to open the purse, which had been left in a plastic bag outside the shop.</p>
        <p>Rostov, about 325 miles northwest of Chechnya, is another stopping point for the Russian military and the headquarters of a powerful new representative of the Kremlin, Col. Gen. Viktor G. Kazantsev, whom Mr. Putin appointed in May to oversee federal affairs in the Caucasus.</p>
        <p>Rostov's deputy mayor told Ekho Moskvy, the news radio station in Moscow, that he doubted that the blast was the work of Chechen guerrillas, but that little would be known until a police inquiry was completed in a day or two.</p>
        <p>The rebels fighting a rear-guard action against Russian forces have repeatedly threatened to carry the war outside Chechnya's borders. But despite the threats, attacks outside Chechnya have generally been small and sporadic.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic this year occurred in Ingushetia, a region adjoining Chechnya, when guerrillas ambushed and decimated a convoy of about 20 Russian troops.</p>
        <p>Russian leaders, from Mr. Putin down, have been declaring the Chechen war over and the region pacified since February. But ambushes and nighttime exchanges of fire remain common, and most outside experts say the region is destined to suffer a long war of attrition.</p>
