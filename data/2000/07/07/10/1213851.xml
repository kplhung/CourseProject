        <p>James Q Wilson Op-Ed article disputes findings of study of capital punishment cases by Columbia University Law School Prof James Liebman, which concluded that for approximately last two decades courts have found serious reversible error in large fraction of cases they reviewed often involving weak defense attorneys and withholding of important evidence from juries; says what study really shows is how well courts shield accused (M)</p>

        <p>For those who support capital punishment, as I do, the possibility that innocent people could be executed is profoundly disturbing. No human arrangement can guarantee perfection, but if perfection is not possible, then the number of errors ought to kept as low as possible. For that reason, it is worth studying ''Broken System: Error Rates in Capital Cases,'' the recent report by Professor James Liebman and others at the Columbia University Law School, especially since that document has stimulated an outpouring of media coverage.</p>
        <p>Its essential finding is that, for the last two decades or so, courts have found ''serious, reversible error'' in a large fraction of the cases they reviewed. These errors, the report claimed, often involved weak or incompetent defense attorneys and the withholding of important evidence from the juries.</p>
        <p>But notice what the report did not say. Its authors did not attempt to discover whether any innocent person had been executed, and they made no claim that this has happened. Instead, they said that the large number of appeals leaves ''grave doubt whether we do catch'' all of the errors. The clear implication is that, were the truth known, we might well be killing many innocent people.</p>
        <p>But that truth is not known. The Death Penalty Information Center, a rallying point for opponents of execution, reports that since 1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, 69 people have been released from death row after they were found to be innocent. But the center does not say that any innocent person has been put to death, though if it had found such a case it surely would have proclaimed it.</p>
        <p>The Columbia University report shows that death sentences are intensively reviewed by appeals courts. Some critics of these reviews think they take too long and involve too many unnecessary bites at the apple, and that may be true. But if we are to err, it is best that we err on the side of safety.</p>
        <p>Nine or 10 years usually pass between the imposition of the death penalty and its being carried out. It took 19 years and appeals heard by more than 30 judges before Gary Graham was executed last month in Texas. It is hard to imagine that this much time is necessary for an adequate appeal, but offsetting the cost and delay is the assurance of only a small chance that an innocent person will be killed. The 5,760 death sentences handed out since 1973 had, by 1995, led to only 313 executions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liebman suggests that the high rate of appeals means that serious errors are often made by the trial courts. But before we can accept that conclusion, we must first know whether the errors were serious enough to affect the outcomes of the cases when they were sent back for new trials. Did an ''error'' cause a new trial that set aside the death penalty? Unfortunately, Mr. Liebman was able to learn this for only a small number of the reversals.</p>
        <p>Because of Supreme Court decisions, every death-penalty conviction leads to an appeal to the state's highest court. About two-fifths of these cases were reversed. As I read the report, we have no information about what happened in the new trials.</p>
        <p>Then there are state appeals after convictions. These also led to many reversals, but we don't know what happened to the great majority of these cases when they were retried because trial courts ordinarily do not publish their findings. Mr. Liebman and his colleagues managed to find 301 cases that had been retried, but we have no idea whether these were representative of all of those appealed or were only a few dramatic ones that somehow came to the attention of outsiders.</p>
        <p>Of these 301 new actions by trial courts, 22 found that the defendant was not guilty of a capital crime, 54 reimposed the death sentence and 247 imposed prison sentences.</p>
        <p>Then there were appeals to the federal courts that also led to reversals in about two-fifths of the cases, but again we are not certain what happened in all the new trials.</p>
        <p>The report also lumps together cases going back to 1973 with those decided more recently, even though the Supreme Court in 1976 created new procedural guarantees that automatically overturned many of the death-penalty decisions made between 1973 and 1976. It is not clear from the Columbia report what fraction of its reversals date back to these big changes in the rules.</p>
        <p>In short, in the vast majority of death-penalty cases we have no idea whether the finding of error that led to a reversal was based on a legal technicality, a changing high-court standard about how a capital crime ought to be tried or a judgment that the defendants might be innocent. All we know for certain is that a lot of death-penalty cases are reviewed over a long period of time -- a fact that dramatically reduces the chances of innocent people having been executed.</p>
        <p>More procedural reforms may be coming. Congress is now considering a bill that would require federal courts to order DNA testing, at government expense if the defendant is indigent, whenever DNA evidence from the crime is available. It also would require states seeking federal crime-control funds to certify that they have  effective systems for providing competent legal services to indigent defendants in death-penalty cases.</p>
        <p>But more might be done at the state level. States ought to have laws that create imprisonment without possibility of parole for first-degree murder convictions, and the judge in every such case should instruct the jurors in the sentencing phase that they can choose that or the death penalty. This allows jurors who may have some doubts about the strength of the evidence or some other plausible worry to hedge their bets if they are so inclined.</p>
        <p>Not every state now has such laws. In Texas, the alternative to the death sentence is life in prison, but without an absolute guarantee that the offender will actually spend his life there. Jurors rightly suspect that the perpetrator will find some way to get back on the street, and so they often vote for death.</p>
        <p>The American Law Institute, a group of legal scholars that designs uniform state legal codes, has recommended that even when a jury decides that capital punishment is appropriate, the judge should be allowed to bar the death penalty if the evidence ''does not foreclose all doubt respecting the defendant's guilt.'' The states have not adopted this rule, but perhaps they should, especially if this change could be coupled with procedures designed to reduce the seemingly endless number of post-trial appeals.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, we ought to calm down. No one has shown that innocent people are being executed. The argument against the death penalty cannot, on the evidence we now have, rest on the likelihood of serious error. It can only rest, I think, on moral grounds. Is death an excessive penalty for any offense? I think not, but those who disagree should make their views on the morality of execution clear and not rely on arguments about appeals, costs and the tiny chance that someday somebody innocent will be killed.</p>
