        <p>''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the latest book in J. K. Rowling's wildly popular series about a boy wizard, set records in its first weekend of sales, leaving many bookstores around the country already out of stock. The book's first printing was the largest ever and has already proven insufficient.</p>
        <p>The new book went on sale at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, and many bookstores held late-night events to capitalize on the pent-up demand from young readers hooked on the series. A spokeswoman for Barnes &amp; Noble, which is based in New York and is the largest bookstore chain in the United States, said its 544 stores and its Web site together sold more than 500,000 copies over the weekend in addition to more than 360,000 orders before publication.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Borders Group, a chain of 305 stores based in Ann Arbor, Mich., estimated that the company sold more than 200,000 copies over the weekend. Both chains reported on Sunday that some stores were already out of stock.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com, the on-line bookseller, which reported more than 350,000 orders before publication, sold more than 26,000 additional copies over the weekend. Independent stores also reported record sales and short supplies, according to the American Booksellers Association. Powell's Books in Portland, Ore., said yesterday afternoon that it had sold more than 775 copies at its main store, with 400 remaining in stock.</p>
        <p>Scholastic, the book's American publisher, initially printed 3.8 million copies of the book. That was more than last year's United States sales for the year's best-selling hardcover book, the previous title in the Harry Potter series. Most of the first printing was shipped to stores last week, and the publisher said it would print two million more in the next month. It said it would begin shipping its current stock and reprinting new copies today.</p>
