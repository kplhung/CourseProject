        <p>Republican governors outnumber Democrats almost 2 to 1, and they were a confident, even cocky, bunch this weekend as they descended on this university town in central Pennsylvania for the 92nd annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.</p>
        <p>At every opportunity, they boasted that one of their own, George W. Bush of Texas, was a shoo-in to win this year's presidential race.</p>
        <p>And to boot, they predicted, Republicans would retain control of Congress and win most, maybe even all, of the 11 governorships up for grabs.</p>
        <p>''We could hardly feel better about the way things are going,'' said Gov. Edward T. Schafer of North Dakota, chairman of the Republican Governors' Association.</p>
        <p>Democrats, not to be outdone, insisted that Vice President Al Gore would turn things around once the nominating conventions are over later this summer and voters are able to focus on the fall election.</p>
        <p>''We're extremely optimistic,'' said Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association. ''We're looking to majority Democratic leadership in this country.''</p>
        <p>So confident was the Bush campaign that it did not send an envoy to brief Republicans -- neither Mr. Bush nor his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, made an appearance. Mr. Gore sent William M. Daley, his new campaign manager, to reassure and assuage Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daley met privately with the Democratic governors. No sooner had he gone than both Republicans and Democrats scheduled news conferences, events that were so politically partisan that they submerged what was meant to be the main business of the meeting, a four-day, nonpartisan discussion about ''strengthening the American states in the new global economy.''</p>
        <p>Instead, there was endless speculation about whether any of the 40 or so governors present might end up as vice presidential choices.</p>
        <p>No fewer than eight had been mentioned as possible candidates and just as the dueling news conferences by Democratic and Republican governors overshadowed the convention, so, too, did the vice presidential stir, which also had its moments of one-upmanship.</p>
        <p>Was the stir causing any tension among the governors? Mr. Schafer was asked.</p>
        <p>''What tension?'' replied Mr. Schafer, who is not the subject of any serious speculation about being a vice presidential choice. ''I haven't noticed any tension. I don't see them in any competition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton said Mr. Daley exuded confidence while briefing Democratic governors.</p>
        <p>''He was very, very upbeat,'' Mr. Patton said. ''He said that this race would turn around as soon as people began focusing on it, after the conventions. They're not doing that now.''</p>
        <p>Why would the post-convention focus improve Mr. Gore's standing, when 9 out of 10 national polls have had him trailing Mr. Bush by 5 to 10 points for several months?</p>
        <p>Because, Mr. Patton replied, other polls have indicated that on most major social and economic issues, voters favor the Democrats.</p>
        <p>''The voters are with us,'' he said, ''and when people focus on what they want, Al Gore will win.''</p>
        <p>Did the Democratic governors, by predicting a post-convention collapse of the Bush campaign, see a parallel with the 1988 campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts? Mr. Dukakis, a Democrat, led Governor Bush's father by a substantial margin for months but faltered after the conventions.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't necessarily say that,'' replied Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, a Democrat. ''What I do say is that when people finally focus on what counts and what they want, Al Gore will be president.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Parris N. Glendening of Maryland, a Democrat, argued that Mr. Gore would win not only because of his stands on the issues but also because he was a ''proven leader,'' experienced in handling both domestic and foreign issues.</p>
        <p>''Contrast that to the less-than-stellar performance and experience of George W. Bush,'' Mr. Glendening said.</p>
        <p>If there was any anti-Bush argument that hit home with Republicans, the assertion that Mr. Bush was not up to handling the White House job was it. They devoted most of an hourlong news conference to arguing otherwise.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, prominently mentioned as a possible  running mate for Mr. Bush, said the Texas governor was an experienced leader because he had served as chief executive of one of the nation's largest states and understood how to ''practice the politics of what works.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore does not understand that governing principle, Mr. Ridge added, because he has never been in an executive position.</p>
        <p>On the issue of supplying pharmaceuticals to the elderly and poor, Mr. Ridge said, Mr. Gore sees it as ''you're either for the drug companies or for senior citizens.''</p>
        <p>''You should try to get people together,'' Mr. Ridge said. ''The politicization of that issue is not how to get things done.''</p>
        <p>Today, the governors managed to break free of partisan politicking for an hour or so to hear Gen. Colin L. Powell discuss programs they might put in place to help the nation's young people, a cause he has been promoting since retiring from the United States Army.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the talk came around to politics.</p>
        <p>First, the general was asked again whether he would accept an offer to be Mr. Bush's running mate or possibly run for president himself at some point, given his popularity with Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>
        <p>No, General Powell replied, as he has been replying for months. But some day, he said, he might accept an appointive job in government.</p>
        <p>Then, just as the general was preparing to leave the convention hall, Gov. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware had a word with him.</p>
        <p>''I used to think you'd make a good president,'' Mr. Carper said. ''Now I know you would.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carper is a Democrat.</p>
        <p>President Clinton will address the governors on Monday.</p>
