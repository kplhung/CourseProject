        <p>Barak's Coalition Erodes On Eve of Peace Talks  Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government disintegrated, as one right-leaning party after another quit in protest of anticipated concessions to the Palestinians, leaving him on unsteady ground on the eve of his departure to a summit meeting.</p>

        <p>World AIDS Forum Opens  South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, opening the first international conference on AIDS in a developing country, singled out poverty, rather than the disease ravaging his country and continent, as Africa's leading killer.

        <p>Test Failure May Delay Decision  Senior advisers to President Clinton said they expect him to make a decision this summer on whether to proceed with a missile defense system, but they acknowledged that the failure of a test on Saturday made it far more likely that Mr. Clinton's successor would ultimately decide the project's fate.</p>

        <p>Parties Still Split Over Size of Tax Cut  With projections of the federal budget surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode, the debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds. Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most Democrats will support, and there is unlikely to be any legislative breakthrough this year.</p>

        <p>Hate Symbol at Work  Employment experts say that the symbolic use of hangman's nooses, although still rare, is increasingly turning up in ordinary workplaces. And the nooses are affecting not just black employees, but also those of Asian, Hispanic and Native American descent.

        <p>Alliance for Fishing Quotas  Fishermen and conservation groups are seeking to end the scramble and the dangers associated with the so-called derby approach to fishing, in which captains are given a strict limit of fish to compete for and a brief time to catch them. Those unhappy with this system would instead allot fishermen individual quotas.</p>

        <p>Alzheimer's Increasing Rapidly  Alzheimer's disease is increasing so fast that more than 22 million people worldwide will be affected by 2025, experts said.

The move would reaffirm the company's American roots and put its image makers into the media capital of the world and near Wall Street.</p>
