        <p>Gloria Hamilton never saw a double-looped noose hanging on her door in 1992. Friends at the Detroit cargo facility where she worked as a service manager for Northwest Airlines  took the noose down before she came to work that day, she said, so that she would not be upset seeing it.</p>
        <p>Three years later, however, Ms. Hamilton, who is black, was alerted to a knotted noose in an employee lunchroom. This time she took the noose down -- after first taking a picture of it -- and then complained to a higher manager. The company is challenging Ms. Hamilton's account, and says that there is no evidence that the piece of rope she found was intended to intimidate any employee because of race or sex.</p>
        <p>That's not the way Ms. Hamilton sees it. ''I'm old enough to remember Emmett Till,'' she said, referring to the 1955 lynching of a black teenager from Chicago who was accused of whistling at a white woman while visiting relatives in Mississippi.</p>
        <p>The hangman's noose has long been one of the most frightening representations of racial harassment in America, a reminder that thousands of black people died at the hands of lynch mobs from the end of the Civil War well into the 20th century. But while the symbolic use of a noose has traditionally been associated with hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, employment experts say that nooses, although still rare, are increasingly turning up in ordinary workplaces. And noose incidents are affecting not just black employees, but also those of Asian, Hispanic and Native American descent.</p>
        <p>Many companies still prefer to settle such cases out of court, but officials at the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission say they have at least 20 noose-related lawsuits pending or recently resolved. For an agency that files only a few hundred lawsuits a year, they add, that is a disproportionately high number.</p>
        <p>And the agency says it is currently examining dozens of other allegations involving nooses from around the country.</p>
        <p>In most cases, officials say, a noose was placed anonymously on an employee's chair, in a locker, or on a door. But the Miami office of the equal employment opportunity commission is currently pursuing a lawsuit on behalf of a black employee, who, it says, had a noose wrapped around his neck, which was then pulled, while he was working for a Florida office of the Asplundh Tree Expert Company. The company, which is based in Willow Grove, Pa., said it had no comment on the suit.</p>
        <p>No one is sure why reports of such racial incidents have risen lately. Some employment lawyers see it as reflecting intolerance among certain younger workers who do not remember the civil rights struggles of the 1950's and 1960's. The incidents, experts say, also might reflect resentment among some whites over affirmative action in diverse workplaces where blacks and other minorities were often excluded in the past.</p>
        <p>At the same time, says Ida L. Castro, the chairwoman of the equal employment agency, the increase in court cases might also be due to a growing defensiveness on the part of some employers, who sometimes treat them ''almost flippantly.''</p>
        <p>''What I see as alarming is not just that employers are now fighting us in courts,'' she said, ''but that they're also making statements implying that such incidents are just horseplay.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a recent exhibit of photographs -- many once used as postcards -- of white participants in lynchings and their lifeless victims only reminded viewers of why nooses are such an incendiary emblem of America's not-so-distant past.</p>
        <p>Nor are noose incidents confined to one region of the country.</p>
        <p>Jeff Lanza, a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Kansas City, Mo., says his office is investigating two cases of nooses left in workplaces. The regional office of the equal employment agency in Charlotte, N.C., has three racial harassment lawsuits pending where nooses were said to be involved.</p>
        <p>The Miami office has an equal number, including one in which a Sanibel Island, Fla., country club has been charged with failing to act against several workers accused of holding up a hangman's noose to a black groundskeeper before asking him whether he wanted ''to go for a ride.'' Art Cassell, a member of the board of governors of the Sanctuary Golf Club in Sanibel, said the suit was ''completely without merit.''</p>
        <p>The Dallas office of the commission is investigating four such cases. In Detroit, the agency is continuing to pursue a lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Hamilton. And the agency has one current lawsuit in California.</p>
        <p>Still, the cases the equal employment office is pursuing may represent only the tip of a workplace iceberg. The agency handles just a small fraction of the thousands of lawsuits that are filed privately between employees and employers each year.</p>
        <p>Employment lawyers say that it is impossible to say how many of those cases involve noose incidents. But David Bennet Ross, a managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw, a law firm based in Chicago that represents employers, thinks they ''happen with surprising frequency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross said he could think of only one noose-related lawsuit in which a court had found that an employee had fabricated the claim, in order to collect money.</p>
        <p>''They're a sign,'' he said, ''that something serious is going on in the workplace.''</p>
        <p>Employment lawyers say that incidents involving nooses are now appearing at large and small companies alike.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanza, the Kansas City F.B.I. agent, said that until recently cross burnings seemed to be the ''hate crime of choice,'' in his area, but that noose incidents are now appearing instead.</p>
        <p>''I've been here 12 years and I can't remember any other noose cases that preceded the two we now have,'' Mr. Lanza said. The Justice Department considers noose incidents to be federal crimes of intimidation, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Over all, racial harassment charges have surged over the last two decades, with the E.E.O.C. reporting that it received close to 50,000 such charges during the 1990's, versus roughly 10,000 in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The agency considers noose incidents to be among the most egregious forms of racial harassment.</p>
        <p>Yet some employees say they have lost their jobs after speaking out against racial harassment incidents like the display of nooses.</p>
        <p>In January, Harold H. Archuleta, a former mechanic for American Airlines, filed a lawsuit against the company charging that he had been wrongfully fired for complaining about aircraft safety violations, and also for supporting the racial harassment and discrimination claims of another American employee, Charles L. Walker.</p>
        <p>In his court papers, Mr. Archuleta, who is Native American, said that his superiors at American took no steps to prevent, among other things, the ''prominent'' display of nooses at the airline's maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
        <p>During the two or three years before he left American in May 1998, Mr. Archuleta said he saw three nooses displayed at the maintenance facility: one in the area where the company gave out time cards, another in front of a production control office and a third carried by Mr. Walker, as he was on his way to complain about it to his managers.</p>
        <p>Each time he saw a noose at his workplace, Mr. Archuleta recalled recently, he ''couldn't believe it was happening.''</p>
        <p>Tim Kincaid, a spokesman for American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said that the airline settled Mr. Walker's case out of court last fall. As for Mr. Archuleta's suit, Mr. Kincaid said that a company investigation found no evidence of racial harassment at the Los Angeles facility, and that Mr. Archuleta's claims were simply an effort to ''mask his own misconduct.'' According to American, Mr. Archuleta was fired for failing to remove outdated life vests from certain airplanes, a charge that he denies.</p>
        <p>At Lockheed Martin, the military contractor, seven current and former hourly employees at its plant in Marietta, Ga., filed a lawsuit in Atlanta in May charging that the company had excluded them from its promotion process. They also stated that Lockheed Martin management had ignored -- or conducted only a cursory investigation of -- numerous racial harassment incidents, including some involving the display of nooses. In the suit, Joseph Banks, a Lockheed employee who still works for the company, said a hangman's noose was placed in his work area last summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banks took his complaint about the noose to the equal employment commission in October last year. On the same day, another Lockheed employee, Ted Gignilliat, who had earlier accused the company of discriminating against him because he is disabled, also filed a complaint that he had received threats after witnessing a noose at the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gignilliat says that he has seen roughly a half-dozen nooses displayed during his tenure with Lockheed, and that the two most recent incidents occured during the spring of 1999. He says that he reported the most recent incident last September to Lockheed's human resources department, but that his effort received no response, as did another a month later to the security department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gignilliat said he was spurred to act, in part, after Lockheed managers issued memos in August stating that the company thoroughly investigated all harassment and discrimination claims.</p>
        <p>Sam Grizzle, a Lockheed spokesman, said that the noose Mr. Gignilliat reported last fall was already under investigation and that the company was not aware that he had ever reported any other incidents.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a response last month to the May lawsuit, Lockheed denied the employees' charges. In its court papers, Lockheed acknowledged that a rope tied in the shape of a noose had been found in Mr. Banks' department, but said the rope was not in his work area. The company, which declined to comment more specifically because of the litigation, stated that it had investigated the incident ''immediately and thoroughly,'' but had not been able to determine who had left the noose.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross, the employment lawyer, said he advises companies that have received a complaint of racial harassment to investigate immediately. But unlike many other harassment cases, it is usually difficult to identify the culprits because most nooses are left anonymously.</p>
        <p>In the case involving Ms. Hamilton, Northwest Airlines, in its court papers, said that it learned of the noose incident only after Ms. Hamilton had been denied a promotion, and after she had gone to the equal employment agency to complain about racial and sexual harassment at the company. Ms. Hamilton said that she had indeed notified the company when the incident occured.</p>
        <p>The company also argued that the noose that Ms. Hamilton found was simply a piece of rope, and that there was no evidence it was directed against her or any member of a minority group.</p>
        <p>The equal employment agency's suit against Northwest involving Ms. Hamilton and some other employees at its Detroit cargo facility has yet to be resolved.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in January the agency's San Francisco office also filed a noose-related lawsuit against Northwest. It charged that employees at the airline's maintenance department at San Francisco Airport subjected a Filipino mechanic, Marcel Espiritu, to almost five years of racial harassment. After Mr. Espiritu filed his accusation with the federal agency, officials say, he found a noose hanging in his locker, along with a note that read ''get Marcel.''</p>
        <p>William R. Tamayo, a regional attorney for the equal employment agency, says that Northwest Airlines never did enough to investigate the incident. In response to both cases, Kathy Peach, a spokeswoman for Northwest, said that it was company policy not to comment on lawsuits in litigation. ''We believe that it is dangerous to draw conclusions before the legal process has been fully completed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Hamilton, the noose she found in 1995 still haunts her. Last fall, while attending a work-related conference in Minneapolis, she ran into a Northwest vice president, who showed her a newspaper article on the lawsuit and then expressed surprise that she still worked for the airline.</p>
        <p>Shaken, Ms. Hamilton went back to her hotel room, only to discover while packing that she had unwittingly hidden the noose at the bottom of her garment bag.</p>
        <p>''It was like getting a double whammy,'' she recalled. ''I need to find a better place to put it.''</p>
