        <p>A demonstration by the Orange Order, a traditional Protestant organization, over a ban on the group's marching route through a Catholic neighborhood began peacefully today, but was marked by violent protests and clashes with soldiers in the evening.</p>
        <p>Accompanied by bands of accordion players and drummers, Orangemen in ceremonial bowler hats and orange sashes marched from the center of Portadown to the Drumcree church before they were stopped by a barricade. The British Army had erected the 20-foot-high steel-and-concrete barrier to prevent the men from returning to town along a route that took them down the Garvaghy Road, in a largely Catholic residential neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Some 2,000 Orangemen and supporters rallied for an hour after the blocked march as religious leaders offered up prayer and political invective. Despite pouring rain, hundreds of supporters remained at the scene after the rally.</p>
        <p>Later, the crowd grew again, to about 1,000 demonstrators, who clashed with the soldiers, throwing bottles and stones and trying to break through the barricade.</p>
        <p>''We are here this morning with one aim: to have our civil and religious liberties restored,'' said the Portadown Orangemen's leader, Harold Gracey, who called for province-wide protests on Monday.</p>
        <p>Protestant parades throughout July commemorate ancient victories over Catholics. The most famous is the Battle of the Boyne, where King William IV of England defeated the forces of the Catholic King James II in 1690. It is celebrated on July 12.</p>
        <p>Protestants were blocked from marching through the Catholic neighborhood two years ago, leading to an extended sit-in at Drumcree. Meanwhile, a power-sharing home-rule government including both Protestants and Catholics has begun functioning in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>This year's period of tension before the so-called marching season included bonfires, carjackings and confrontations with the police by people who said they were supporting the Drumcree cause. The actions began in Belfast last Sunday and continued through the week.</p>
        <p>Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, accused Protestant paramilitary organizations of hijacking the Portadown Orange Order's cause for their own ends. ''The time for legitimate protest is behind us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Johnny Adair, a Protestant paramilitary leader who was recently released from prison, appeared at the Drumcree parish church of the Church of Ireland on Tuesday, contributing to fears of further violence. He showed up again today.</p>
        <p>In two incidents early today, an Orange Order hall in nearby Cookstown was burned in an attack attributed to arson, and a car bomb in nearby Stewartstown shattered windows in homes. Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Northern Irish police force, said the car bomb was probably the work of a dissident republican group called the Real I.R.A.</p>
        <p>At the rally today, Mr. Gracey refused to distance himself from the week's disturbances. ''I'm not in the business of condemning violence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The protests did not go uncriticized by Protestants, though. The Church of Ireland's primate, Robin Eames, archbishop of Armagh, condemned the standoff, saying, ''I see nothing of Jesus Christ in the nightly actions on Drumcree Hill or in the roads and streets of Northern Ireland night by night.''</p>
