        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have a suggestion for people of different racial backgrounds who feel they are just spinning wheels in their attempts to solve the race question (''How Race Is Lived in America''), even after spending a lot of time working together.</p>
        <p>Stop focusing on specific instances that are interpreted so differently from each side of the racial divide. Instead, think of your efforts as a graduate education project, perhaps even structure them formally and study the nature of argumentation.</p>

        <p>Even for those who are already well educated and experienced, this may be a way to really study what is going on in these personal relationships and to move forward. It might even be fun, with the satisfaction of a mutual effort.</p>
