        <p>It struck me, while laughing my way through ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' that its creators may be the only comic filmmakers in America who truly find white people at least as preposterous as they find black people. And given that they are white, this is a real accomplishment.</p>
        <p>It could have been deduced from what the writing-directing trio of Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly and Mike Cerrone did with (and to) the white characters of ''Dumb and Dumber'' and ''There's Something About Mary.'' Such goings on! Such rambunctious ids and demented egos! But whites are rarely considered ''white'' until nonwhite characters show up on the same screen.</p>

        <p>It struck me, while laughing my way through ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' that its creators may be the only comic filmmakers in America who truly find white people at least as preposterous as they find black people. And given that they are white, this is a real accomplishment.</p>
        <p>It could have been deduced from what the writing-directing trio of Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly and Mike Cerrone did with (and to) the white characters of ''Dumb and Dumber'' and ''There's Something About Mary.'' Such goings on! Such rambunctious ids and demented egos! But whites are rarely considered ''white'' until nonwhite characters show up on the same screen.</p>
        <p>I did remember seeing a black midget in the trailer for ''Irene,'' but he was attacking Jim Carrey first with his tiny fists and then with a nightstick. It was easy to think, ''Well, boys will be brats'' and go on about one's business. After all, the midget was cited in passing, if at all, in most reviews as just one more example of compulsive cinematic vulgarity, along with sex toys, barnyard animals and toilet jokes.</p>
        <p>But vulgarity can be the best weapon against a standing army of platitudes and pieties. Bless that midget. He is a loud, paranoid cabdriver who picks a pointless fight with Charlie (Mr. Carrey), the sweet state trooper who is about to escort his new bride over the threshold of their home. Surely the joke is on political correctness, you think, as he rants on about bigotry (It's racism! It's a small people thing!) in his ghetto voice.</p>
        <p>But our midget is also a graduate student at Brown and a chapter president of Mensa, the self-described organization ''for bright people'' whose sole qualification for membership is a high I.Q. Charlie's lithe blond bride is a Mensa chapter president also. The two lock eyes and eventually end up running away together, leaving Charlie with three black sons (Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon). And since he refuses to acknowledge that the triplets were fathered by the black midget, he refuses to acknowledge that they are black.</p>
        <p>Do you remember ''My Three Sons'' with Fred MacMurray as the wrly avuncular TV dad? The home scenes here are demented episodes of that show, with MacMurray's confident wryness turned slightly anxious and -- when Charlie tosses a few ''soul'' expressions their way -- ingratiating. It is nice racial trompe l'oeil that the actors playing the triplets don't really resemble one another much more than they resemble Mr. Carrey. True, they're all big, and they're all about the same shade of brown. (Mr. Carrey and a number of male cast members are tall and all about the same shade of pale beige.)</p>
        <p>The boys banter like street thugs, love and honor their father, and trade competitive chaff -- shall we say signify on each other -- about physics problems and SAT scores. One brother protests that he got 1,430 out of a possible 1,600 points because he had the flu. You'd have to have an aneurysm to get 1430 he is told with cheerful disdain.</p>
        <p>Is it believable that black triplets who talk like street thugs (or rappers) can be top students and good sons? Let's look at it this way. In 1967, when Sidney Poitier played a distinguished scientist who is a candidate for a Nobel Prize in Stanley Kramer's film about interracial love and courtship, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' how many people found it believable? Viewers and reviewers both complained about the lack of realism. Why did Mr. Poitier's character have to be so dazzlingly exceptional, they kept asking? It strained credibility.</p>
        <p>And it isn't as if the intervening 33 years have brought us a spate of movies in which blacks are terrifically smart and confident about much beyond their clothes, their sexual prowess or their criminal records. (And clearly we're talking about men here. There haven't been a lot of movies in which black women played anything that could be called a leading role.)</p>
        <p>So I loved these vaudevillian whiz kids. Ditto the jungle-fever kisses exchanged by the black midget and the full-size blonde as they drove off together. ''I guess the heart wants what the heart wants,'' she tells Charlie. And it's true of comedy, too. However outrageous the situation, once it compels our laughter, we've let it into our world. The absurd wouldn't matter if we didn't know it was the shadow side -- disdained, longed for, or both -- of the normal.</p>
        <p>The actors playing the whiz kid sons as vaudeville join a long line of black comics who started out in late-19th-century minstrel shows and worked like mad to turn a style that signified the bumptious, the bombastic and the genetically inept into an innovative form of verbal and physical comedy. Of course the triplets watch Richard Pryor and Chris Rock on television.</p>
        <p>And so does their Daddy, which is just right in terms of comic genealogies. Mr. Carrey got his first real break in 1990 as one of two white performers on ''In Living Color,'' the Wayans Brothers' raucous black comedy show.</p>
        <p>And he out-minstreled everyone in sight. He was shameless and outrageous: a white fool or a maniac who kept his white face on at all times. Steve Martin had given us a sweeter less staccato version of the white minstrel in his early years; it was no accident that in his first movie, ''The Jerk,'' he played a character who thought he had been born black.</p>
        <p>Old-time vaudeville made fun of most white ethnics for a time: the Irish, the Italians, the Germans, the Jews, sometimes playing themselves and sometimes playing one another. And there have been plenty of comics since who played dumb, dumber and dumbest with gusto, from Lou Costello to Tommy Smothers and Dick Martin; from Art Carney as Ed Norton on ''The Honeymooners'' to Jerry Lewis at his most infantile and Dean Martin at his most mentally woozy.</p>
        <p>But it is Mr. Carrey who keeps the race engine fueled and running. And he's wonderful here as the man with two inadequate personalities: Charlie, the sweet, repressed sap, and Hank, the mellifluously crude bully. Every muscle of his face and every bone in his body are utterly committed to these alternating bouts of mousiness and mania.</p>
        <p>People keep saying that since the script for ''Me, Myself and Irene'' was written 10 years ago, the Farrellys dragged it out of their drawer and tossed it cynically onto a movie screen because they knew they were on a roll. I won't overstate things by insisting that we have a masterpiece of radical entertainment here, especially since the movie drifts into a formula feel-good rescue and happy ending. But really could they have gotten it made with all the racial nose-thumbing intact before they became famous?</p>
        <p>Interracial lust and familial warmth are still pretty much taboo in the movies, as is the sight of not one, not two but three super-smart, well-adjusted and hip black male teenagers. However race is lived off screen in America, people are still happiest when it makes its on screen appearance as fantasy. It might be the science fiction of ''The Matrix,'' the high-tech espionage of ''Mission Impossible'' or the comic improbabilities of ''Me, Myself and Irene.''  And when it comes to comedy, race is still the best -- and the worst -- joke ever played on the United States of America.</p>
