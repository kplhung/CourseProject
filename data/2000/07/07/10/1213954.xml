        <p>A driver swerved in front of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's sport-utility vehicle on the Grand Central Parkway yesterday, causing a three-car pileup that injured three police officers -- but not Mr. Giuliani -- before the driver sped away, city officials said.</p>
        <p>The collision occurred shortly before 6 p.m. after a gray car on the congested parkway cut off the mayor's vehicle, causing Mr. Giuliani's driver to slam on the brakes, city officials said. A black police sedan, which was following closely, then slammed into the rear of the mayor's S.U.V., which was heading to Shea Stadium for the Mets and Yankees game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and four police officers involved in the accident were taken to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling O.K.,'' Mr. Giuliani said, speaking with reporters outside the hospital. ''I think we were very fortunate in that actually when this took place, I thought it would create a reverberating effect and there would be four or five other cars that would get involved in a pileup. That didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's driver was injured when his gun jammed him in his  side, and two officers in the unmarked sedan were hurt. The detective in the passenger seat of that car suffered injuries to his stomach and knee, the mayor said, and the driver was also hurt, although details of his minor injuries were not available.  ''Thank goodness the air bags worked,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>The collision occurred at Jewel Avenue, just south of the Long Island Expressway, near Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The driver who caused the accident briefly stopped and got out of his car to assess the damage, but then drove off before the police could question him, city officials said. He was described as a man in his 60's with gray hair, and was driving what Mr. Giuliani said was an early 1990's model car.</p>
        <p>''I got a quick look at him as the accident was taking place, and I got a quick look as he was driving away,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>The mayor was seated behind his driver and was wearing his seat belt.  His vehicle was pushed forward by the impact, causing it to hit the car that had cut the S.U.V. off, officials said. The black sedan was demolished in the accident, and the air bags deployed. The mayor's vehicle had less severe damage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who has spent many hours over the last two months consulting with doctors over his treatment for prostate cancer, stayed at the hospital to monitor the status of the injured officers.</p>
        <p>The mayor said, ''I wish the man who was in front would just turn himself in.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was checked out by doctors, the mayor replied: ''I don't want to get poked. I have gotten poked enough in the last month.''</p>
