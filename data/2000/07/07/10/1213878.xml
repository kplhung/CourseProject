        <p>In the entertaining cookbook of recipes from modern dancers and choreographers just published by the American Dance Festival here, Twyla Tharp's entry reads as follows: ''Here's what I can do. Turkey from the deli, sliced. Baked potato, usually harder than a rock. A banana. Love, Twyla.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp has always known how to make do in modern dance, a do-it-yourself art form rooted in individual expression. She stretches the definition of dance, not just recipes, and her gift for combining disparate ingredients is embodied in the ferocious virtuosity that colors the two new Tharp works presented by the festival from Thursday through Saturday.</p>
        <p>Energy at its most turbulent erupts throughout ''Surfer at the Styx'' (to be retitled ''Surfer at the River Styx''), a loose allegory about two souls battling aspects of themselves and the Styx (symbolized by a quartet) before they cross into a peaceful place.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp's vision of heaven and hell takes some time to reveal itself. John Selya, in white surfer's outfit, and Keith Roberts are magnificent soloists, clearly tormented onstage by a quartet in black. But before the work's dramatic meaning snaps fully into place, the viewer is swept away by the sheer dance power of the choreography. This is nonstop, fierce bravura, delivered with mind-boggling stamina from the new company that Ms. Tharp has just formed.</p>
        <p>For ''Surfer,'' she has found a perfect collaborator in Donald Knaack, whose music she used so wittily in a now celebrated duet for Ethan Stiefel and Susan Jaffe in her ''Known by Heart'' at American Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knaack, an experimental composer who once worked with John Cage, as well as with the modern-dance pioneer Bella Lewitzky, meets Ms. Tharp on the same maverick level of energy and rhythm. Known professionally as the Junkman, he was in the pit on Thursday night in Page Auditorium at Duke University, the festival's home, playing an assortment of discarded found objects: hubcaps, a basketball hoop, a mailbox, pots and pans, and so on.</p>
        <p>An electronic tape in the same vein produced by David Kahne, who composed the coda for the heavenly apotheosis, was channeled into Mr. Knaack's multilevel percussion. Ms. Tharp replied with a richly layered design onstage.</p>
        <p>''Surfer'' has the impact of Ms. Tharp's most exciting and athletically inclined classics, namely ''The Golden Section'' and ''In the Upper Room.'' It will be an obvious crowd pleaser in the new company, Twyla Tharp Dance, that made its debut with these performances.</p>
        <p>Yet ''Mozart Clarinet Quintet K.581,'' the second premiere on the program and named after its score, shares certain elements with ''Surfer.'' The three men and two women (who are not on toe) look more classical as the sound of the clarinet floats poetically above them. Yet in both pieces, Ms. Tharp focuses more than ever on novel ways of partnering. Conventional ballet lifts yield to startling images. A woman topples head down repeatedly as if dunked into a vat while her partner holds her by her knees.</p>
        <p>Modern dance and ballet are integrated easily in these works. Without their ballet training, Mr. Selya, Mr. Roberts, Benjamin Bowman, Ashley Tuttle and Elizabeth Parkinson would not be so at ease in the adagio partnering, which is foreign to modern dance. Nor would Mr. Selya and Mr. Roberts, both formerly with Ballet Theater, be able to display the virtuosity that Ms. Tharp draws from traditional ballet bravura. Yet she also uses Francie Huber and Andrew Asnes for their compelling energy and clarity, qualities they showed with Paul Taylor's company.</p>
        <p>An immediate tension in ''Surfer'' is set up between a black-clad chorus and the male soloists, Mr. Selya and Mr. Roberts. The chorus's bent arms and profiles recall the machinelike movement in ''Known by Heart.'' Yet this time the score has a less metallic ring. Both the music and the choreography were commissioned by the festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the last of their ''Modern Dance and Jazz Music Collaborations.'' To see Mr. Knaack's music as jazz would take some doing. But rhythm, no stranger to jazz, is at the pulse of this collaboration.</p>
        <p>For all their robotic manner, Ms. Parkinson, Mr. Bowman, Ms. Huber and Mr. Asnes become increasingly abstract. They symbolize the surf that Mr. Selya rides through his high leaps as the surfer of the title.</p>
        <p>In an unexpected passage Mr. Selya is mocked by Mr. Asnes and Mr. Bowman, who perform a precious dance with mincing steps on tiptoe. There is tremendous drive here in the constant interplay between the two male soloists and the quartet. If Mr. Selya is the leaper, Mr. Roberts is the turner and the audience cheered as he spun in a variety of pirouettes beyond the call of duty.</p>
        <p>After all the karate kicks, pelvis swiveling and ballet bravura, the final never-neverland of healing or redemption, peace after turmoil, hits the right note.</p>
        <p>The same superb performances came from the cast of ''Mozart Clarinet Quintet K.581,'' whose music was on tape. Ms. Tuttle, on leave from Ballet Theater, and Ms. Parkinson were in short tunics over chartreuse leotards. Mr. Roberts, Mr. Selya and Mr. Asnes, who began the first section, were in Chinese-style vests by Santo Loquasto.</p>
        <p>Here again Ms. Tharp does not reveal where her piece will go. The lyrical male trio, moving in and out of shifting patterns, yields to two duets that are the work's highlight: one for Ms. Tuttle and Mr. Selya and one for Ms. Parkinson and Mr. Roberts that is amazing in its acrobatic convolutions. The two ensemble sections, which include a sketched-out mazurka, are a bit entangled. But there is a novelty about the ballet that opens up the Mozart score through a mix of playfulness and seriousness. Scott Zielinski provided the admirable lighting.</p>
