        <p>It's Roger Clemens's story, and he's sticking to it.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't trying to hit him in the head; I was trying to crowd him, pitch him inside,'' Clemens said yesterday, reiterating what he had said the night before. ''The guy's hit me well and I was trying to make an adjustment, but the adjustment I was trying to make wasn't to hit the guy in the head.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' pitcher was talking about the pitch that hit Mike Piazza in the head Saturday night at Yankee Stadium. While Clemens held to his explanation, the Mets weren't buying it. To the Mets, the pitch, which they viewed as deliberate, signaled the outbreak of a New York baseball war that may be hostile enough to get George Steinbrenner's juices flowing again. After all, the Yankees' doodle-dandy principal owner turned 70 on July 4, and sometimes it takes the type of reaction that flowed from Mets officials to boil the blood.</p>
        <p>Besides the pointed comments the Mets continued making before the final game of the four-game interleague series with the Yankees, Steve Phillips, their general manager, threw about half a dozen members of the Yankees out of the Shea Stadium weight room and canceled plans for the Mets' All-Star Game contingent to fly to Atlanta with the Yankees' group on a chartered plane after last night's game.</p>
        <p>Had Steinbrenner been immediately privy to the developments, he would have had the opportunity to add a line to his legendary lexicon of choice comments. Phillips could have joined Frank Cashen, one of his predecessors, in the Steinbrenner version of ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.''</p>
        <p>Hideki Irabu wasn't the first target of a Steinbrenner zinger that used the word pus as an adjective. Steinbrenner used that word years ago to disparage Cashen after Cashen, then the Mets' general manager, referred to Yankee Stadium by the name of a movie popular at the time, ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.''</p>
        <p>Relations between the teams became so hostile at one point that the Mets refused to play spring training games against the Yankees. The Yankees wanted the Mets to play at their spring site in Fort Lauderdale but wouldn't go across Florida to play at the Mets' spring home in St. Petersburg.</p>
        <p>Before that period, the Mets once used Dwight Gooden and Frank Viola in the same spring game and beat the Yankees. Steinbrenner sneered at the Mets, saying they were so desperate to beat the Yankees that they saved their Cy Young award winners for them.</p>
        <p>In those years, the most important exhibition games the Yankees played, according to Steinbrenner guidelines, were those against the Mets that were televised back to New York. The second most important were games against the Mets that weren't televised.</p>
        <p>After a Billy Martin-managed Yankees team lost a televised game to the Mets, Steinbrenner stormed into the clubhouse and started screaming at Martin. When Martin retreated to the trainer's room, Steinbrenner followed. The feisty manager yelled back at the owner, telling him not to yell at him in front of his players. For emphasis, Martin slammed a table with his hand. Except a big tub of ice was on the table, and Martin's hand struck the ice, splashing water all over Gabe Paul, an innocent bystander of a general manager.</p>
        <p>Later on, when Lou Piniella was managing the Yankees, he used minor leaguers against the Mets. A Steinbrenner eruption ensued, prompted by his embarrassment in front of a group of high-powered friends, including Lee Iacocca.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner wouldn't allow his general managers to make trades with the Mets. When Piniella was the Yankees' general manager, he had a deal with Joe McIlvaine of the Mets for Rafael Santana, but Steinbrenner refused to approve it. Finally, after Piniella implored him to let the trade go through, Steinbrenner told him, ''If we're going to trade with them, get that guy Jefferson.''</p>
        <p>Piniella had no idea whom his boss meant until he realized that the cover of a recent baseball publication featured Gregg Jefferies.</p>
        <p>Then there were the skirmishes Steinbrenner staged by using players. If the Mets had a good young player on their team, the Yankees had to find one to match him. Thus because Dwight Gooden was a Mets pitcher, the Yankees rushed Jose Rijo to the major leagues. Tim Leary's presence on the Mets' pitching staff produced Gene Nelson prematurely for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Before the 1985 season, the Yankees and the Mets made stunning trades days apart. The Yankees acquired Rickey Henderson, the Mets Gary Carter. The teams subsequently had their new players in town, holding news conferences only days apart. Steinbrenner was livid about the newspaper coverage of the events and ordered his public relations people to tabulate the column inches each received.</p>
        <p>When the count ran heavily in the Mets' favor, Steinbrenner chewed out his public relations staff, saying the Mets' staff had done a better job.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner has never taken his feud with the Mets to the ownership level. He has never spoken ill publicly of Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, always saying he liked the two men, which is more than the two men can say of each other.</p>
        <p>But if the Mets have branded Clemens as a lowlife of a pitcher, Phillips, a Wilpon-Doubleday lieutenant, could be a marked man. The next voice heard may be that of General Steinbrenner.</p>
