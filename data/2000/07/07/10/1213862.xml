        <p>Mention the word ''footprint'' and images of an ill-fated Himalayan expedition in search of the Yeti might come to mind. But when you mention footprint to people familiar with the Sprint Corporation, their eyes light up with optimism over what the future may hold.</p>
        <p>In the argot of the mobile telecommunications world, footprint refers to the breadth of network coverage, and perhaps no company has matched Sprint the last couple of years in its speed and efficiency in building a nationwide wireless communications business.</p>
        <p>That is why, even if the company's  $115 billion merger agreement with WorldCom unravels, Sprint's wireless network remains a coveted asset.</p>
        <p>Regulators in Europe oppose the WorldCom-Sprint deal on grounds  that it would leave WorldCom with too much control of Internet traffic, while the Justice Department says it would leave too few long-distance options. But Sprint is still expected to have attentive suitors -- quite possibly Deutsche Telekom, BellSouth and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone -- attracted by its wireless prize.</p>
        <p>''Sprint has almost everything that a company wanting to expand in the U.S. would want,'' said Brian Hayward, manager of the $3.6 billion Invesco Telecommunications Fund in Denver. ''But what really makes it attractive is extensive digital nationwide wireless coverage, because that's where many people are betting the future is at.''</p>
        <p>Sprint PCS, the company's wireless subsidiary, operates the largest all-digital wireless network in the country, covering an area reaching more than 70 percent of the population. Aided by revenue from wireless Internet services that were recently introduced, Sprint PCS's average monthly revenue per user is $54, which is 30 percent higher than the industry average.</p>
        <p>Although in terms of subscribers, Sprint's wireless network ranks fourth behind those of Verizon Wireless, SBC/BellSouth and AT&amp;T Wireless, the company has led the wireless industry in subscriber growth for six consecutive quarters. With its own retail stores, and an aggressive distribution effort involving more than 12,000 third-party retail outlets that include Tandy's Radio Shack chain and Best Buy, Sprint signed up  an additional 876,000 customers during the first quarter of this year, an 18 percent increase from the comparable period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Analysts expect such subscriber growth to continue, with Sprint signing up as many as four million customers this year, accounting for about 20 percent of the industry's growth in the United States.</p>
        <p>''Because it's built a wireless network that has a lot of buzz around it with such high-visibility growth, Sprint's an obvious takeover play if WorldCom exits the scene,'' said Steve Shook, a telecommunications analyst at Wachovia Securities.</p>
        <p>Last year, Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., received merger overtures from BellSouth, which was eventually outbid by WorldCom. But the interest of BellSouth, based in Atlanta, could be rekindled by the possibility of assembling a seamless network that would theoretically allow a caller to use the same mobile phone from coast to coast.</p>
        <p>And the interest of the German communications giant, Deutsche Telekom, has been more than explicit. The possibility of a German bid for Sprint has already elicited a reaction from Senate leaders, who oppose  such a deal on the grounds that it might violate a law preventing the Federal Communications Commission from transferring radio licenses to companies that are more than 25 percent owned by foreign governments. Cellular operators use radio waves under license from the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said that opposition to such a deal might wilt if the German government were to reiterate its stated intent to reduce its stake in Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecommunications company.</p>
        <p>''It flies in the face of everything the United States stands for in promoting free markets around the world for our own government to oppose investment by a foreign telecommunications company, whether it's state-owned or not,'' said Frank Marsala, a telecommunications analyst at ING Barings.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Sprint is seeking to balance market enthusiasm for its wireless operations with concern about a management transition at Sprint PCS. Andrew Sukawaty, who is credited as the driving force behind much of the Sprint PCS strategy during the last several years, announced in May that he would step down as chief executive of the wireless business to pursue business opportunities in Europe.</p>
        <p>Sprint's chief operating officer, Ronald T. LeMay, is serving as acting president of the wireless unit while a search for a new Sprint PCS chief gets under way. Mr. LeMay and Sprint's chairman, William T. Esrey, declined to comment on efforts to replace Mr. Sukawaty.</p>
        <p>Just how fast Sprint becomes a takeover target depends on how quickly its fate is untangled from WorldCom's. By then, Sprint could find itself competing for attention among other wireless carriers, like VoiceStream Wireless and Nextel Communications, which have also been discussed as targets in the nation's fast-consolidating wireless industry.</p>
        <p>''So much attention is focused right now on the U.S. wireless market because of the growth potential that exists here,'' said Larry Swasey, vice president for communications research at Allied Business Intelligence. ''Sprint probably offers a nice foothold for expansion into the U.S., but it's a competitive marketplace with several opportunities.''</p>
