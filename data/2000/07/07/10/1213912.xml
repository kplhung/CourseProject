        <p>The recent arrest  of a prominent sociologist on suspicion of ''defaming'' Egypt has alarmed human rights advocates around the region who say it reflects a policy among Arab leaders toward political criticism that can best be described as killing the messenger.</p>

        <p>The recent arrest  of a prominent sociologist on suspicion of ''defaming'' Egypt has alarmed human rights advocates around the region who say it reflects a policy among Arab leaders toward political criticism that can best be described as killing the messenger.</p>
        <p>''The government has convinced the people that Egypt and the government are one and the same thing,'' said Gasser Abdel Razik, secretary general of a legal aid center in Cairo. ''If someone criticizes the government, then it is an insult against Egypt. If any crisis erupts, they do not solve it but they punish the one who reported it.''</p>
        <p>The sociologist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who has been in an Egyptian prison since June 30, has taught at the American University in Cairo for 25 years. He founded the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Developmental Studies, a private group in Cairo that includes two government ministers on its board and conducts research on democracy, civil society and minority rights.</p>
        <p>He recently wrote an article in a Saudi magazine, Al Majala, that satirized the efforts by some Arab leaders to groom their sons for succession. Among others, Dr. Ibrahim mentioned President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He also has written frequently on the status of the Christian minority in Egypt, where the subject of religious tensions is taboo.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim has been held since security agents began interrogating him on June 30 about a documentary his center produced to instruct Egyptians about their voting rights and encourage them to take part in a parliamentary election scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>Hafez Abu Saada, who is one of Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers, said investigators had accused him of defaming Egypt because the film refers to complaints about fraud filed after past elections.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim has not been charged with a crime but is being held for 15 days for questioning. Under Egyptian law, detention without charge can be extended up to 45 days.</p>
        <p>Officials of the United States Embassy in Cairo who visited Dr. Ibrahim said he had reassured them he was not being mistreated. The American ambassador, Daniel Kurzer, has expressed concern about the arrest to Egypt's prime minister, according to an embassy spokesman.</p>
        <p>''We hope that his detention is not inspired by a desire to silence a voice advocating freedom of expression and democracy,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim, a former adviser to the Egyptian government who holds dual Egyptian and American citizenship, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Washington and has written or edited 30 books in English and Arabic. He has been a frequent guest at international conferences on Arab political life.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim's arrest has worried human rights groups and advocates around the Arab Middle East, where nongovernmental organizations and journalists who criticize their governments are routinely harassed or imprisoned.</p>
        <p>''Saad Eddin Ibrahim's arrest reminds us that one of the leading sources of instability and political-economic distortion in the Arab world is the unchecked use of state power, combined with the state's whimsical ability to use the rule of law for its own political ends,'' Rami G. Khouri, a political analyst, wrote in The Jordan Times last week.</p>
        <p>Despite apparent progress in a handful of countries that declare themselves to be democracies, like Egypt and Jordan, independent organizations have found themselves fighting for their lives, he added.</p>
        <p>Egypt, like its neighbors, tightly regulates nongovernmental organizations and the press. Labor unions can be formed and hold internal elections only with government approval. The government licenses political parties -- and has approved only one new party in the past 22 years. A handful of others operate, but most were allowed only after appealing to the judiciary.</p>
        <p>Last year, Egypt enacted a law requiring all nongovernmental organizations to register, report any foreign financing and submit the names of their trustees to the government for approval. The law was seen as an attempt to control groups that might serve as fronts for Islamic militants, but it was widely criticized by human rights and legal aid groups. It was declared unconstitutional, on technical grounds, by the Constitutional Court last month.</p>
        <p>Egypt has more than a dozen groups that investigate human rights abuses and many newspapers that publish reports on torture, illegal detention, prison conditions and other topics. They have fax machines, speak openly to foreign journalists and post reports on their Web sites.</p>
        <p>But when the subject turns to a few particularly sensitive topics -- among them election fraud, official corruption and religious tension -- the government has cracked down, often using a provision in the penal code that makes it a crime to defame Egypt's reputation.</p>
        <p>Five journalists at the daily newspaper Al Ahrar, for example, were recently sentenced to jail terms because they had published a Government Accounting Office report on mismanagement at the government airline, EgyptAir. Officials of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights were jailed last year, accused of defaming the country and illegally accepting foreign funds, after publishing a report on the police handling of a clash between Christians and Muslims in Upper Egypt.</p>
        <p>''The government wants to finish off all civil society organizations in Egypt,'' said Mr. Abu Saada, the secretary general of the group, who was himself jailed for several weeks after the report was published last year. ''Either we agree with them all the time or we are the enemy.''</p>
        <p>In Jordan, it is still a crime to insult the dignity of the king and, as in Egypt or other Arab countries, courts can shut down a publication or jail people who are found to have harmed the ''public interest'' or criticized members of the government.</p>
        <p>Government officials in Egypt said Dr. Ibrahim was the subject of a lengthy police investigation before he was arrested. Hisham Saraya, the chief prosecutor of the state security agency, said Dr. Ibrahim was suspected of illegally taking money from a foreign entity, using that money fraudulently and forging election ballots.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers said the election ballots were printed for use in the documentary. They said he received money from the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to make the film.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saraya, the government prosecutor, said protests from diplomats and other human rights advocates would have no effect on the police inquiry against Dr. Ibrahim. ''No other authority -- nothing but truth and justice -- can influence our prosecution,'' he said.</p>
