        <p>The girl is tireless and should, by rights, be tiresome.

        <p>The girl is tireless and should, by rights, be tiresome. There's that driving adolescent energy, to start with, plus an unfortunate leaning to whimsy evident in her insistence on regularly changing her name. Why, listen to her, declaiming a list of American cities with that radioactive mix of concentration and anarchic glee. Don't you just want to strangle her?</p>
        <p>Actually, no, you don't. Nor, even more surprisingly, do any of the characters who share the stage with her in the Williamstown Theater Festival's affectionate new production of Lanford Wilson's ''Hot l Baltimore.'' Played by the young actress Mandy Siegfried with the happy unself-consciousness of a colt that has just found its legs, the 19-year-old known simply as, yes, the Girl seems to make everyone smile, even those who feel honor bound to despise her.</p>
        <p>That's still the overall effect of ''The Hot l Baltimore,'' 27 years after it opened to become the must-see Off Broadway hit, winning New York Drama Critics Circle and Obie awards. This group portrait of dispossessed American souls in a seedy hotel on the eve of its demolition has always sounded impossible to stomach and been equally impossible to resist.</p>
        <p>Even in 1973 reviewers remarked that the play was a throwback to an earlier, more sentimental era of lyric drama, when William Saroyan was serving up the dreams of the unsung and the unwanted. Here again was a parade of lovable prostitutes and mixed nuts, including an old man who exercised by singing opera in the lobby and an old woman who had a close acquaintance with ghosts.</p>
        <p>Like Saroyan, Mr. Wilson generated a democratic glow of love for American diversity, even as the show symbolically pointed to the country's decline. Since it was the  1970's instead of the 1930's, it made perfect sense when the play became the inspiration for a sitcom on ABC.</p>
        <p>Yet for those of us who saw the original ''Hot l,'' as directed by Marshall W. Mason with a cast that included the young Judd Hirsch, the play was hardly just a sitcom in the making. Its more irritating aspects were transformed by Mr. Wilson's and the ensemble's ''sympathetic magic,'' to borrow a term the playwright would later use as a title, by a marrow-deep compassion and respect for the lives portrayed. Such unconditional liking is contagious.</p>
        <p>The new reincarnation of ''Baltimore,'' staged by the estimable Joe Mantello, holds on to that infectiousness. The ensemble doesn't have the necessary rhythmic wholeness. How could it, given the short rehearsal time at Williamstown? There are definitely spots of dead air amid the gloriously shabby hotel-lobby set provided by John Lee Beatty. And those fabled Wilson sequences of simultaneous dialogue, not unlike those Robert Altman was creating in film at the same time, never quite catch fire here.</p>
        <p>The compensations, however, are considerable. They are provided in large part by the sense of fine actors like Lois Smith and Sam Rockwell fully embracing their characters. Only rarely does anyone here go for surface pathos or oddball cuteness. Mr. Mantello has intelligently steered the evening's tone away from the obviously poetic and whimsical, encouraging performances that accept eccentricity as a matter of course.</p>
        <p>Take that girl, for example, the 19-year-old prostitute who, like the father of ''The Glass Menagerie,'' has fallen in love with long distance and spent her young life in eternal transit, listening for the rattle of trains she can identify by their whistles. As played by the enchanting Trish Hawkins in the original production, she was a rather ethereal creature for someone who traded in flesh, a fairy-tale dreamer with a hypnotic voice.</p>
        <p>Clad in hot pants and platform shoes that bring to mind Jodie Foster in ''Taxi Driver'' (the sociologically ruthless costumes are by Laura Bauer), Ms. Siegfried emphasizes the raw, overwhelming vitality and unthinking appetite found in teenagers. This sharp-witted actress, seen off Broadway in ''The Mineola Twins'' and ''Stupid Kids,'' finds her character's soul in her legs, which seem to have restlessly flexible lives of their own.</p>
        <p>The Girl, of course, still has fantasies that, like those of everyone else in Mr. Wilson's world, will never come to fruition. But Ms. Siegfried and Mr. Mantello don't let you regard her as a pitiable symbol. Like many people her age the Girl is, for better or worse, a life force, existing entirely in the present. As April, the aging, wisecracking hooker, says of dancing, in what might be the play's watchwords: ''Nobody knows how. The important thing is to move.''</p>
        <p>April is played by the invaluable Becky Ann Baker, who definitely knows how to move, not to mention how to sell a salty joke without shoving it down your throat. As the evening's third and flakiest streetwalker, Cyndi Coyne is also a treat, flirting brazenly with caricature and then retreating just in time. The same is true of Helen Hanft, a veteran of experimental theater whose very presence sets off nostalgic echoes, and George Hall as members of an older, increasingly lost generation. Ms. Smith brings a stirringly serene air of acceptance to her spirit-communing character, an old woman with memories of an aristocratic Southern past and someone who describes herself, in true Wilsonian fashion, as a perpetual outsider ''with no particular interest in peering in.'' And Mr. Rockwell is excellent as the irritable desk clerk, a role created by Mr. Hirsch.</p>
        <p>Dressed as a brown-toned advertisement for everything that was depressing about 1970's style, Mr. Rockwell never lets his period accouterments overwhelm him, giving instead a discerningly low-key performance. Unlike Mr. Hirsch, whose idiosyncrasies were writ large, Mr. Rockwell fades in and out of the woodwork here, as people who have been in one job for too long will. His character's revelation of his own unrealized desire is all the more affecting for its quietness.</p>
        <p>Sara Gilbert, an indispensable member of the brilliant ensemble of ''Roseanne'' on television, is Jackie, the hyped-up, hustling health food addict whose dreams are dashed most dramatically in the play. Ms. Gilbert is likably game, but the moody intensity she registers on camera is strangely diffused here. What should be sustained fireworks comes across instead as a series of cap-pistol shots.</p>
        <p>This is a reminder of just how much of the theater ''The Hot l Baltimore'' is. Mr. Wilson's characters are necessarily larger than life, because being alive is really all they have going for them. It's not that where there's life, there's hope; these are not hopeful people. Rather this playwright insists that where there is life, there is always interest. Even as its most glib and sentimental ''The Hot l Baltimore'' still pulses with that fascination.</p>
