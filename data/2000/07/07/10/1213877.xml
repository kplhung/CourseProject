        <p>ONLINE retailers have been putting their marketing budgets on crash diets this year, replacing pricey, fatty television ads and portal deals with leaner print ads and e-mail efforts that, like all diet foods, may be less sumptuous but are far healthier in the long run. More recently, dot-com retailers have been testing a new item on the low-fat marketing menu: catalogs.</p>
        <p>Long a staple of the direct marketing industry, catalogs are the newest fad among Web merchants who, in their pursuit of profitability, have cast off any pretensions of Internet-only retailing.</p>
        <p>It should come as no surprise, of course, that Web merchants like RedEnvelope.com, eHats, Food.com and eZiba.com, among others, have either begun mass mailings or are developing such programs. It is an accepted fact that online shoppers and catalog consumers are a similar breed, preferring to browse through merchandise without the help of a sales clerk, and accepting the risks inherent in long-distance purchasing. And the back-office operations of catalog and consumer-oriented e-commerce companies are nearly identical.</p>
        <p>But the catalog leanings of Internet retailers can also be explained by looking at their executive rosters. The dot-coms spent much of 1998 and 1999 raiding the management teams of L. L. Bean and other giants of the direct mail realm, so it was probably inevitable that many Web merchants would expand into catalog operations.</p>
        <p>Although these Internet executives are not abandoning other marketing campaigns as they adopt catalogs, they express delighted surprise about how well catalogs compare with other popular marketing approaches, like e-mail advertising.</p>
        <p>''We can produce and mail a catalog that costs about the same, if not less, than a targeted e-mail campaign,'' said Matt Jackson, vice president for marketing at eHats, an online hat retailer that is developing its first catalog.</p>
        <p>Some companies that conduct custom e-mail campaigns on behalf of e-tailers may charge 25 cents or more per e-mail sent, Mr. Jackson said. According to the Direct Marketing Association, most catalogs cost 50 cents to $1 to print and mail to each household.</p>
        <p>''With an e-mail, people either delete it or look at it quickly and delete it,'' he said. ''But if we execute a catalog properly, we know it'll not only get eyeballs, but it'll stay in someone's house, so it has a shelf life and a much longer-lasting impact than a targeted e-mail campaign.''</p>
        <p>With catalogs, e-tailers also see a way to reach an objective that no amount of digital alchemy can achieve -- selling goods to the 50 percent of American households that remain without Internet connections. ''We have to reach as many people as possible,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''and let them buy in whatever way they feel comfortable, be it through the phone, the Web site, a catalog, whatever.''</p>
        <p>And even as they view catalogs as a cost-effective way to reach offline customers, e-tailers are also looking at them as a means to increase the Web site's traffic.</p>
        <p>Take eZiba.com, which sells handmade goods from far-flung regions of the world. The company plans to begin testing a catalog this fall with a mailing to 500,000 consumers, according to Bill Miller, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, a former executive vice president at F.A.O. Schwarz, said he would use the catalog primarily to attract customers to the eZiba Web site. ''Every time we dropped a catalog at F.A.O., we saw a significant increase in our Web traffic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Catalogs can help create Web site traffic by showing customers a limited, but enticing, selection of a company's overall merchandise offerings, executives said. And because a Web order is less expensive to process than a phone-based order, companies frequently offer discounts or free shipping to draw customers to their sites.</p>
        <p>EZiba has more reason than many other  e-tailers to use catalogs as a device for generating Web traffic, rather than mainly a vehicle for direct sales, Mr. Miller said. Because eZiba's business involves selling goods with limited availability, the company cannot stock enough items to support an extensive catalog mailed to tens of millions of consumers. EZiba will ship a catalog with a limited number of items that will be well-stocked, in case consumers order those items in droves.</p>
        <p>In theory, at least, Internet merchants are nicely positioned to produce a catalog at low cost. Many e-tailers already have plenty of product descriptions and high-resolution digital photographs of merchandise on hand, as well as in-house creative directors with experience in print publishing.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Web retailers who have initiated catalog efforts say incremental production costs are minimal. But executives said that to market a catalog successfully, companies must overcome far more difficult, and potentially expensive, hurdles.</p>
        <p>Inventory management, as Mr. Miller noted, can be a huge issue.</p>
        <p>Tom Bazzone, president of RedEnvelope.com, an online gifts retailer that began selling through catalogs in February, said merchants that did not properly manage inventory during a catalog mailing risked either alienating customers with sold-out items, or burying their warehouses in unsold merchandise.</p>
        <p>For most catalogs, he said, 75 to 80 percent of the sales occur within 40 days of the mailing. As a result, many catalog operations engage in what is called ''slotting,'' or staggering their order volumes with suppliers. So instead of ordering 1,000 items from a vendor, they would arrange to receive 300 initially, have another 300 delivered two weeks after the catalog is shipped, and then have the option of either receiving or canceling the remaining items, depending on sales.</p>
        <p>The process is even more complicated for Web retailers, he said, because the same items sell at different rates through the different channels. ''It can get very hairy,'' Mr. Bazzone said.</p>
        <p>Developing an effective mailing list is no snap either, executives said.</p>
        <p>Companies must know their audience well enough to cite specific customer demographics when they approach so-called list brokers, who typically sell names and addresses of prospective customers for $100 to $125 per thousand. And once the first mailing goes out, merchants must have the personnel and technology in place to analyze the response rates, so they can fine-tune subsequent mailings.</p>
        <p>''It becomes Direct Marketing 101 from there,'' said Cindy Marshall, director of marketing for eZiba.com.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for dot-coms, the course requirements for Direct Marketing 101 also include a large section on customer service -- an area of study that many e-tailers seemed to have slept through in previous semesters. H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct Marketing Association, an industry trade group, said Internet merchants ''need to have real customer service when it comes to a catalog, because customers expect it.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, he said, that requires substantial investment in phone-based customer-service representatives. ''And it's probably too late for some companies who are cash poor to make enough of an investment in customer service to make it work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet Internet companies that follow the catalog path can take some solace in the experiences of Mr. Bazzone at RedEnvelope. He said that only 30 percent of the orders generated by the company's catalogs were taken over the phone. The rest, he said, came via the Web.</p>
        <p>Karen Orton, senior vice president for business development at Food.com, which delivers take-out food for 16,000 restaurants around the country, said she hoped the company's coming catalog effort would, like RedEnvelope.com, yield far more Web orders than phone orders. Because the company already takes large numbers of orders over the phone, Ms. Orton said she was not concerned about the effect a catalog might have on customer service.</p>
        <p>''We see the catalog as a way to migrate people from the phone to the online experience,'' she said. For instance, Ms. Orton said that in a recent survey 68 percent of the customers who had ordered over the phone said they would prefer to use the Internet. ''So we see this as a great opportunity for us.''</p>
