        <p>Almost two months after North America's deadliest outbreak of E. coli contamination hit this town, people's sentiments are captured on a road sign: ''E. coli, please go away.''</p>
        <p>In this once obscure farming community near Lake Huron, residents live in fear of the bacteria that entered their lives through their drinking water. Lingering in a closed branch of the municipal water system, the fatal strain, Escherichia coli O157:H7, still infects a well that was sealed when the outbreak became public, on May 23.</p>
        <p>Since then, E. coli has been identified as the killer of seven people and is being investigated in nine more deaths. In addition, 90 people were admitted to hospital, almost 1,000 were treated and released, and another 1,000 called medical professionals to complain of diarrhea or cramps. All in all, the bacteria laid low about 40 percent of Walkerton's population of 4,800.</p>
        <p>''This would be the first water-borne outbreak in North America,'' said Dr. Murray S. McQuigge, medical officer for the region, who first raised the alarm. Since the fatal strain of E. coli was identified in 1982, it largely has been transmitted through food.</p>
        <p>The tragedy has thrust Walkerton -- a pastoral town about three hours northwest of Toronto -- into the middle of a political tussle over Canada's future: to the conservatives who hope to recapture the national government in elections next year, Walkerton symbolizes bureaucratic incompetence; liberals, meanwhile, use it to illustrate the danger of making cuts in Canada's social net.</p>
        <p>For the left, the contamination was detected too late because Mike Harris, premier of Ontario and Canada's most powerful conservative in office, cut the budget of the Environment Ministry by 42 percent after taking power in 1995. Nine hundred staff members were fired. The ministry halved the number of annual water utility inspections.</p>
        <p>''Walkerton dramatized that a right wing, market-based agenda of deregulation and privatization leaves people vulnerable,'' said Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a liberal group.</p>
        <p>For the right, Walkerton would have been spared the tragedy if the water system had been privatized and run for profit by efficient managers. The conservative side admits, however, that Mr. Harris's government was sloppy when it handed water testing over to private laboratories without requiring that the laboratories be accredited or that they send test results to health and environmental oversight agencies.</p>
        <p>After the E. coli scandal broke, a mid-June poll showed that the Liberal Party lead over Mr. Harris's Progressive Conservative Party had doubled to 7 percent in just two months. The day after this poll was completed, the Harris government dropped plans to privatize Ontario's public water systems.</p>
        <p>During the first four months of this year, water samples submitted by Walkerton's public water company tested positive for E. coli bacteria five times, according to Ontario's Environment Ministry. But, in a violation of procedure, these test results were not passed to the regional medical officer, Dr. McQuigge.</p>
        <p>They also did not cause undue concern for Stan Koebel, manager of the water company, which forwarded them to the ministry.</p>
        <p>On May 12, a heavy rain fell when a chlorinator on one well had been out of service for a month. Public health officials theorize that flood waters washed into wells manure contaminated with E. coli, a bacterium that is found, at any given time, in roughly 10 percent of North American cows, sheep and deer.</p>
        <p>''A lot of times we would end up with fecal matter in the water, and boil the water for a while, but this is the first time that water killed people,'' said John Markauskas, a high school science teacher. ''I don't think people realized that you can get E. coli from water. You thought it was from uncooked food.''</p>
        <p>After Mother's Day, May 14, town residents and visitors started falling ill with diarrhea. On May 15, Mr. Koebel shipped water samples marked ''Rush, Rush, Rush'' to a private laboratory that regularly tested the town's water. According to John Martin, an environmental lawyer contracted by the town, the results came back the next day showing that ''Well 7 had high levels of total coliform and E. coli.''</p>
        <p>Well 7, the only town water source at the time, was not receiving chlorine, which normally would have killed the bacteria. As the week progressed, more and more residents appeared at local hospitals suffering from bloody diarrhea.</p>
        <p>Dr. McQuigge said that toward the end of the week, he, two assistants and a local nursing home director separately telephoned the water company to ask whether the water was contaminated. Each caller was assured that the water was fine, he said. At the same time, according to Mr. Martin, the water company started adding chlorine to the water to kill the bacteria.</p>
        <p>''I can't conjecture why we were told four times that the water was all right,'' Dr. McQuigge mused. ''We spent two days needlessly looking around for possible food sources.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, May 21, he said his staff started marking a town map with a yellow dot for each diarrhea case. ''At the end of the day, the map of Walkerton was yellow,'' he said. ''We knew there was only one thing that can do that -- the water supply.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McQuigge ordered Walkerton residents to boil their drinking water.  Mr. Koebel, meanwhile, insisted in a May 23 interview in the local newspaper that the cause of the diarrhea outbreak was still a mystery.</p>
        <p>Later on May 23, Dr. McQuigge received results of water tests that he had independently commissioned. After telephoning Mr. Koebel and telling him that the town water was contaminated with E. coli, the health officer said the water manager ''broke down'' and ''said he knew that.'' Since the tragedy, Mr. Koebel has been in seclusion, refusing to give interviews or to make public statements. He is the subject of a police investigation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, anger is rising. Residents expect to depend on bottled water into August, restaurants have written off the tourist season, and supermarkets have had a slump in sales. Premier Harris rubbed many residents the wrong way when he came here and implied that outsiders were stirring up trouble.</p>
        <p>''We have seven dead already, we have children with permanent organ damage, we face six to eight more weeks without water, we have massive business losses,'' said Bruce Davidson, a massage therapist who has started a pressure group, Concerned Walkerton Citizens. ''We don't need any help in being agitated.''</p>
