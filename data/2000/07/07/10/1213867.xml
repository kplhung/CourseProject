        <p>The summer box-office slump is officially over.</p>
        <p>''Scary Movie,'' a raunchy spoof of teenage horror flicks that cost $19 million to make, earned an estimated $42.5 million at the nation's box offices over the weekend, roughly $1 million more than ''The Perfect Storm'' earned in its opening last weekend.</p>
        <p>It was the second-biggest opening of the year (behind $57.8 million for ''Mission: Impossible 2'' over Memorial Day), the biggest opening ever for an R-rated movie and the biggest opening ever for Miramax Films.</p>
        <p>''Hollywood has made so many horror movies in recent years, including our own 'Scream' series, that the genre was ripe for a spoof,'' said Bob Weinstein, who runs Miramax with his brother, Harvey. ''And then we decided to put the movie out in the summertime, against all these big studio behemoths. They are one type of movie, and we're another. Our special effects are laughs, and they're very inexpensive.''</p>
        <p>''Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, drew decidedly mixed reviews for its gleefully vulgar jabs at films like ''The Blair Witch Project'' and ''I Know What You Did Last Summer.''</p>
        <p>Miramax was also eager to point out that its exit polling showed that about one-third of the movie's audience was over 25, a much older demographic than teenage slasher movies usually enjoy. ''It just tells you the audience wants comedy,'' said Dennis Rice, president of marketing for Miramax.</p>
        <p>Paul Dergarabedian, chairman of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors box-office performance, said ''Scary Movie'' succeeded because it was the first recent wide release to be aimed primarily at a young audience.</p>
        <p>''Even the critics were saying, 'The movie looks really cheesy, it looks like it was shot on video,' but so what?'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''The most voracious filmgoing audience, young people, is ready and eager to go to the theaters.''</p>
        <p>In June, when box-office figures were slumping, the top weekend openings were generally $20 million to $25 million, and the dropoff as movies went into their second and third weekends was often quite severe. Now the story is different.</p>
        <p>Not only did ''The Perfect Storm'' and ''Scary Movie'' earn more than $40 million in their openings, but several other movies were also holding up well. This weekend's estimated box-office total for the top 12 films was $136.6 million, an increase of 26 percent from the same weekend last year.</p>
        <p>''The Perfect Storm'' earned $27.7 million in its second weekend, a drop of about 35 percent, indicating that it should continue to draw sizable audiences in coming weeks. Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Brothers, said the film became only the third movie in the studio's history to earn $100 million in 10 days; the other two were Batman movies. ''What's nice about it is it shows that the box office has come back,'' Mr. Fellman said.</p>
        <p>The news was also quite good for two other films, ''The Patriot'' and ''Chicken Run.''</p>
        <p>In its second weekend ''The Patriot,'' the Revolutionary War epic starring Mel Gibson, earned an estimated $15.5 million, a drop of only 31 percent from its opening, indicating that it, too, will probably play well in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>''It really has the earmarks of a film that adults want to see, but they're not necessarily going to run out over the opening weekend,'' Mr. Dergarabedian said. ''I think 'The Patriot' will have long legs.''</p>
        <p>The stop-motion animation of ''Chicken Run'' has apparently captured the family audience, earning an estimated $9.5 million in its third weekend, a drop of only 28 percent from last weekend, for a total of $63.3 million.</p>
        <p>But ''Disney's 'The Kid,' '' a family-oriented time-travel fantasy in which Bruce Willis's character meets himself as a boy, opened in fourth place this weekend with a relatively disappointing $12.5 million.</p>
        <p>The new Jim Carrey comedy, ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' also continued to stumble, dropping 40 percent in its third weekend, to $8 million.</p>
