        <p>Despite terrific pacing and beautiful costumes and photography, something has gone wrong in ''The Patriot,'' the new Mel Gibson movie about the American Revolution. Signs of trouble appear in the idyllic opening scenes. Mr. Gibson plays a reluctant hero named Benjamin Martin, a widower with seven perfect children, a ''Gone with the Wind'' plantation and a work force of free and happy Black Folk who toil in his fields as volunteers.</p>
        <p>Then the plot unfolds. We learn that Martin was the hero of an earlier Indian war, but he decides to sit out the War of Independence until the villainous British Colonel Tavlington (who somewhat resembles the real-life British officer Banastre Tarleton) burns his plantation, carries off the happy Black Folk, kills one of his children and threatens to hang another.</p>

        <p>Despite terrific pacing and beautiful costumes and photography, something has gone wrong in ''The Patriot,'' the new Mel Gibson movie about the American Revolution. Signs of trouble appear in the idyllic opening scenes. Mr. Gibson plays a reluctant hero named Benjamin Martin, a widower with seven perfect children, a ''Gone with the Wind'' plantation and a work force of free and happy Black Folk who toil in his fields as volunteers.</p>
        <p>Then the plot unfolds. We learn that Martin was the hero of an earlier Indian war, but he decides to sit out the War of Independence until the villainous British Colonel Tavlington (who somewhat resembles the real-life British officer Banastre Tarleton) burns his plantation, carries off the happy Black Folk, kills one of his children and threatens to hang another.</p>
        <p>Martin impulsively decides to fight, mainly for revenge against Tavlington, and wins the war more or less single-handedly. With a little assistance from George Washington, Nathaniel Greene and Light Horse Harry Lee, and a lot of help from his long-suffering sons and neighbors, Martin reforms American tactics, defeats General Cornwallis and sets up the British surrender at Yorktown.</p>
        <p>The film purports to be a history of the American Revolution. Its Web site tells us that the characters are ''loosely based'' on fact. How loosely might that be?</p>
        <p>In short, ''The Patriot'' is to history as Godzilla was to biology. Egregious errors appear in every scene.</p>
        <p>Some inaccuracies are introduced to create an illusion of authenticity. Tavlington, for example, is dressed in  a red coat. In fact, Tarleton's mounted legion wore green, but these are the Redcoats, and red their coats must be (an issue discussed at length in Alan Alda's hilarious spoof ''Sweet Liberty''). A similar example appears in the written documents that the tangled underplots require. Eighteenth century ink was black, which on the documents we have from those days  has faded to a soft brown. To make the letters seem authentic in the film, they are freshly written in faded brown ink.</p>
        <p>Mel Gibson's character is ''loosely based'' on five historical figures: Francis Marion, Daniel Morgan, Elijah Clark, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens, combined into an American hero without fault or flaw. The climactic battle where Mel Gibson defeats General Cornwallis and kills Tavlington is ''loosely based'' on a combination of the Battles of Cowpens (which Tarleton lost in Cornwallis's absence) and Guilford Courthouse, Hobkirk's Hill and Eutaw Springs (all of which Cornwallis won). Cornwallis was not defeated in the Carolinas. Tarleton was not killed.</p>
        <p>The film is also heavy with anachronism. The dialogue alternates between 21st century slang and loose quotations from irrelevant historical materials. Mel Gibson is made to say ''I prefer one tyrant 3,000 miles away to 3,000 tyrants one mile away'' -- a garbled quote from Boston Tory Mather Byles -- and then lapses back into slang.</p>
        <p>Other errors introduce to the American Revolution events far removed in time and place. The extreme violence reaches its peak when the villain Tavlington confines the inhabitants of town in a church, sets it ablaze and burns them alive. Something remarkably like this event actually happened, but not in South Carolina during the American Revolution.</p>
        <p>It happened in the French village of Oradour-sur-Glane on June 10, 1944, during World War II, and it was done by Germany's 2nd S.S. Panzer Division. There were atrocities enough on both sides in the American Revolution, but Roland Emmerich, the film's director, has converted an 18th century British and American Loyalist Army into the S.S.</p>
        <p>The British villain Tavlington is so steeped in evil and Cornwallis is so feckless and incompetent that the two men become mere caricatures. (So does the saintly American hero.) The real Tarleton was deeply conflicted, and more dramatic than the cardboard villain we are given here.</p>
        <p>The problem is not merely that a  director has failed an academic test of accuracy, but that the errors have weakened the film's dramatic impact by making our War of Independence appear so artificial. He would have done better if he had listened to history more closely.</p>
