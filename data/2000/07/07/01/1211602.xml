        <p>Without dissent, the Senate approved today an $11.2 billion emergency spending bill whose centerpiece is an aid package to equip and train Colombia's security forces, who are battling drug traffickers and their rebel allies.</p>
        <p>The bill also includes about $2 billion to finance the Pentagon's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, as well as millions of dollars of disaster aid for flood and forest fire victims in the United States.</p>
        <p>A day after the House overwhelmingly approved the measure, the Senate endorsed the aid package by voice vote and joined the House in adjourning for the weeklong July 4 recess. President Clinton is expected to sign the bill soon.</p>
        <p>Even as lawmakers agreed on the broad package of international and domestic assistance, they disagreed on how, or even whether, to ease certain aspects of the longstanding embargo against Cuba.</p>
        <p>House Republicans tried to attach a provision to the emergency aid package that would have allowed the limited sale of food and medicine to Cuba, but Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois backed down in the face of a threatened filibuster by Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, that would have delayed the entire spending package. Dodd and other Democrats had argued that the Republican bill would impose more restrictions than it would lift, and Democrats have proposed their own plan to loosen the embargo.</p>
        <p>Today, the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, vowed to block any attempt to lift the restrictions.</p>
        <p>''I oppose both, and if I can find a way to kill them, I will,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The aid to Colombia was a top priority of the administration and Mr. Hastert. More than 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States reportedly comes from Colombia, and supporters of the $1.3 billion aid package say American assistance is important not only to stabilize a vital ally, but to curtail the flow of drugs into this country.</p>
        <p>''This is a landmark vote, striking the drug war at ground zero -- Colombia,'' said Senator Paul Coverdell, a Georgia Republican.</p>
        <p>But critics warn that the plan is a dangerous escalation of American involvement into a decades-old civil conflict. Opponents have also complained that much of the aid will be going to the Colombian Army, which has a poor human rights record.</p>
        <p>The package includes 18 Blackhawk and 42 Huey II helicopters that will be used to ferry special Colombian Army battalions to the rebel-controlled south, the heart of the narcotics trade.</p>
        <p>''This critical assistance will help the government of Colombia respond to the drug emergency and support its democratic institutions,'' said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the director of the White House office on drug control policy.</p>
        <p>In addition to the international aid, the package also includes $661 million in aid to New Mexico, which is recovering from devastating forest fires that destroyed homes and land two months ago.</p>
