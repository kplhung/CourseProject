      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Attacking the pharmaceutical industry for engaging in ''corporate chutzpah'' and for ''gouging the consumer unfairly,'' Vice President Al Gore said today that he would take on the drug manufacturers next week at campaign stops in battleground states from California to Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>In an interview on the veranda of his home here, Mr. Gore cast himself as a longtime critic of what he said were the industry's excessive prices and profits.</p>
        <p>He does, in fact, have a long record on the topic, dating to his days as a young Tennessee congressman in the early 1980's, when he played a crucial role in defeating legislation that would have granted drug companies patent extensions on lucrative medicines.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Gore is dusting off his Congressional record and past speeches to stake out policies at odds with the manufacturers. A review of his record, though, and a detailed talk with the vice president make clear that his views are more nuanced than his language suggests. And some of the same drug makers that Mr. Gore now criticizes have hired his friends and advisers to represent them as lobbyists.</p>
        <p>The pharmaceutical industry, which responded icily to Mr.Gore's statements today, has in some cases embraced his positions. For instance, drug manufacturers are among the biggest beneficiaries of the government's tax credit for research and development, and Mr. Gore favors legislation that would make that credit permanent.</p>
        <p>And while he argued for greater disclosure of the industry's pricing practices, the vice president allowed that some information probably should remain proprietary. Mr. Gore has also been a strong supporter of the biotechnology industry, which through collaborations and mergers is becoming part of the prescription-drug business.</p>
        <p>''I don't see myself as a basher of the pharmaceutical companies,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I see myself as opposing the excesses that have accompanied their enormous market power, excesses that have come at the expense of consumers.''</p>
        <p>Drug executives, who have contributed far more to the campaign of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, have mixed feelings about Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>His support for innovation and new technology endears him to them, and he is not nearly as vociferous a critic as the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader. But industry executives are becoming more nervous about Mr. Gore as the presidential campaign progresses. And when asked about today's escalating attack, their trade association responded in kind.</p>
        <p>''It's truly sad to hear the vice president arguing for reducing incentives for biomedical innovation,'' Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement. ''If his rhetoric became government policy, patients would suffer. Thankfully, no one will be fooled by political posturing four months before an election.''</p>
        <p>With his heightened, anti-industry stand that consumers are ''being ripped off'' by drug makers, Mr. Gore is positioning himself as a champion of a far-reaching Medicare prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.</p>
        <p>At the same time, his campaign's polls show that the issue resonates strongly with voters. So Mr. Gore is also trying to sharpen the distinctions between himself and Mr. Bush, who supports a benefit that would rely more heavily on private insurers, an approach the industry favors.</p>
        <p>The drug industry is one of the nation's most lucrative, and secretive, businesses. It consistently ranks as the most profitable industry in the Fortune 500 list of companies; in 1999, the industry's net profit after taxes was 18.9 percent of revenues, as compared with 15.8 percent for the next most profitable industry, commercial banking, and 5 percent over all, according to a recent compilation by the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>
        <p>Drug makers argue that their prices are justified by the high costs, and risks, of researching and developing new medicines. And they say they need substantial profits to plow back into research and development, clearing the way for the next generation of wonder drugs. To the industry, any threat to profits or drug prices is a threat to innovation.</p>
        <p>That concern is reflected in the contributions the two major presidential contenders have received. To date, Mr. Bush's campaign has received $221,715 from drug company executives, while Mr. Gore has received $50,700, election records show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not made the prescription-drug issue a cornerstone of his campaign, but one of his top health advisers said that the Texas governor is opposed to tampering with the industry's ability to develop life-saving medications.</p>
        <p>''Anything that would dampen innovation, particularly price controls, ought to be avoided,'' said Bill Roper, who was a top health official in the administration of Mr. Bush's father, and is now dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>''We need to trust the marketplace,'' Mr. Roper added.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign did not make the Texas governor available for an interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said today that he, too, opposed regulating drug prices or profits. ''I don't see it as the government's role,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he did say the industry's profits were out of line, and he favors policies that would, in effect, cut into profits and curb prices.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Gore said he supported a legislative amendment, recently passed by the House of Representatives, requiring drug makers to agree to reasonable prices for treatments invented in collaboration with government scientists.</p>
        <p>There are more than 90 such collaborations under way with the National Cancer Institute alone. But the industry has consistently opposed a pricing clause, and its protests were a main reason why the National Institutes of Health abandoned such a provision in 1995. ''If I had been in the Congress, I certainly would have voted for it,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>In a similar vein, Mr. Gore supports requiring drug companies to pay a fee to the government for medicines developed with the help of government grants. Some of today's top-selling drugs got their start in the federally financed laboratories of university scientists, and Mr. Gore said that the public ''ought to have some right not to be gouged on the purchase of products that they themselves helped to develop.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the vice president favors a proposed rule that would make it more difficult for companies to use the regulatory process to delay competition -- a rule the industry opposes. And he is against a highly publicized provision that has been circulating in Congress to extend the patent for Claritin, the top-selling allergy medication.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's stance on Claritin puts him somewhat at odds with a close adviser and friend, Peter Knight. Last year, Claritin's manufacturer, the Schering-Plough Corporation, hired Mr. Knight to help develop a lobbying campaign for the patent extension, among other issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight has since left the lobbying business, and Mr. Gore insisted today that he has never talked with him, or other friends who have represented drug makers, about industry issues. ''All the positions I've taken,'' he said, ''are against their clients.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was clearly well-briefed for the hourlong interview, and seemed to relish the opportunity to go on the offensive against an industry he has long taken an interest in. At one point, he recalled a meeting he had 18 years ago with Representative Richard Bolling, then the chairman of the House Rules Committee -- a meeting that led to the defeat of the patent-extension legislation the industry coveted.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Gore said, he was particularly irked that the industry refused to make public data that would have supported its position. ''It was the most astounding example of corporate chutzpah I had ever run across,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And in a serendipitous moment for the vice president, his 11-year-old black labrador, Shiloh, wandered onto the veranda midway through the conversation.</p>
        <p>As it happens, Shiloh takes medicine for arthritis. ''This dog here,'' Mr. Gore said, ''gets a cheaper price for the same drug than humans.''</p>
