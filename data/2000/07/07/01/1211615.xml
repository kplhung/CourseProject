        <p>The small, immaculately catered luncheon that drew President Clinton to a stately home here today was billed as a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

        <p>Mr. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race, has been a boon to Democratic candidates across the country, because he has made heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New York who were previously uninvolved in politics.

        <p>The small, immaculately catered luncheon that drew President Clinton to a stately home here today was billed as a benefit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But the anticipated recipient of much of the more than $1 million raised was the candidate who may have the least need for donations and the president's fund-raising help: Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire who broke all records in spending nearly $35 million on his primary race, has been a boon to Democratic candidates across the country, because he has made heavy contributors out of wealthy friends in New Jersey and New York who were previously uninvolved in politics. Many were here today.</p>
        <p>Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the chairman of the fund-raising committee, who has begun to take a more direct hand in guiding Mr. Corzine's campaign as well, missed the event because of a vote in Washington on aid to Colombia.</p>
        <p>But more than 40 people did show up, paying at least $20,000 apiece, in addition to about a dozen local politicians. Among those who dined on medallions of poached Maine lobster tail under a backyard tent were former executives at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, where Mr. Corzine was co-chairman until he resigned last year, and other investment firms.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine will be entitled to receive up to $829,000 from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Although Mr. Torricelli has told Mr. Corzine's associates to expect most of that in the fall, he could opt instead to send it to candidates with thinner resources of their own.</p>
        <p>But today's guests found Mr. Corzine a deserving recipient. ''He shouldn't be expected to have to pay for his entire campaign himself,'' said State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, one of the top Democratic rainmakers in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The host of the luncheon was Orin S. Kramer, a fund manager who gave so much to Democrats last year that he was forbidden to donate to any federal races this year. He introduced Mr. Corzine as ''the single best-liked, most respected C.E.O. on Wall Street.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine seemed to still be smarting from the primary. ''I actually have found a couple of people who don't like me,'' he said. ''Sometimes they write editorials for newspapers.''</p>
        <p>Introducing the president, Mr. Corzine said he was grateful to find Mr. Clinton ''on this side of the river,'' given the ''magnetic draw across the Palisades'' to New York and Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate race against Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>The president's appearance, one Democratic official said today, was as much a thank-you to Mr. Corzine for the money he has helped to raise as an endorsement of his candidacy.</p>
        <p>''I believe the reason that Jon has done so well,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''is that it was, like, now here's this guy who could be off making a gazillion dollars and laying around three days a week, and he actually cares about whether poor kids get a decent education, will their parents have a safe place to make a home, and all that other stuff.</p>
        <p>''Here comes Jon riding in on his horse, the guy's never run for office before, and he's actually committing the unpardonable sin of saying exactly what he thinks, even when it gets him in trouble, and trusting the people to get it right,'' the president said.</p>
        <p>''I encouraged him once -- I knew he was getting a little weary from the cost as well as the strain of the primary campaign,'' Mr. Clinton added. ''I said, 'When the people have enough time and information -- and they need both -- they nearly always get it right.' ''</p>
