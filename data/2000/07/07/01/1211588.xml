        <p>The scarecrow in the field of thriving marijuana plants here was meant to keep birds away, but instead it drew the attention of an airborne police officer this week.</p>
        <p>The officer, Mike Susi of the Westchester County police, noticed a strange shadow on Wednesday as he was flying over the Edith G. Read Natural Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, next to Playland Amusement Park, checking for environmental problems.</p>
        <p>He swooped down for a closer look and saw that the shadow had been cast by a scarecrow standing guard over two well-cultivated 600-square-foot fields.</p>
        <p>''These fields were in the middle of a densely wooded area; people just don't cultivate things in the middle of woods like that for no reason,'' said Sgt. Don McArthur, a Westchester County Police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Officer Susi's next move, Sergeant McArthur said, was to contact Officer Dan Langford of the county police, who is regularly stationed at Playland, and Detective Mark Pierro, a county narcotics specialist. After they could not find a way into the area on foot, Officer Langford boarded the helicopter and he and Officer Susi headed back to the marijuana patch. As the helicopter hovered five feet over the ground, Officer Langford jumped out.</p>
        <p>''They discovered 75 hemp -- marijuana -- plants, the tallest three feet, the smallest a few inches,'' Sergeant McArthur said. ''And they discovered that the 'farmer,' for lack of a better word, had constructed a little three-foot-high tunnel through the underbrush. That's how he got in and out of the place.''</p>
        <p>The officers pulled out the plants, bagged them and took them to headquarters. Sergeant McArthur would not elaborate on the next phase of the investigation, but said the first priority had simply been removal.</p>
