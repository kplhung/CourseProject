        <p>The police will keep a playoff-sized army of officers assigned to Shea Stadium for the duration of the Mets' four-game series with the Atlanta Braves to ensure that the fragile truce with John Rocker holds through the weekend, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It would be foolhardy not to,'' said Marilyn Mode, a Police Department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Although there have been several arrests and a slew of summonses for public drinking outside the stadium, there have not been any serious incidents that have marred the games, officials said.</p>
        <p>But city officials do not want to take any chances today or tomorrow, they said, especially since they are not convinced that fan animus toward Rocker has completely abated. Even after his public apology Thursday, Rocker was the target of a few projectiles hurled from the stands as he entered the game in the eighth inning on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The police have assigned 700 officers -- 640 more than usual -- to work at the stadium for the series, including undercover officers who circulate in the stands and a team of officers that guards Rocker around the clock, at his hotel and in the bullpen.</p>
        <p>One of the four fans arrested Thursday night was accused of trying to throw a beer into the bullpen at Rocker. In addition, there were 73 summonses issued, including 63 for public drinking, 3 for unlicensed vending, 2 for scalping and 5 for disorderly conduct.</p>
