        <p>Fearing that the trial of Jose Bove would turn their quiet little town into an actual battleground for the forces of anti-globalization, most store owners kept their iron gates closed today. The McDonald's restaurant, which Mr. Bove is charged with ransacking last year, was blockaded by two dozen police vehicles.</p>
        <p>But as the trial opened, the atmosphere seemed more like a French Woodstock than a Seattle. Thousands of teenagers with green hair gathered along with middle-aged men with pigtails and retirees wearing T-shirts that said, ''The world is not merchandise and I'm not either.''</p>
        <p>Others set up tents and strummed guitars in the streets in support of Mr. Bove, the sheep farmer who has become something of a national hero with his fight against multinational corporations and what he calls the industrialization of agriculture.</p>
        <p>Since the McDonald's attack, Mr. Bove has become a national celebrity. He now has a busy speaking schedule, a more prominent job with his union and dinner invitations from high-level government officials, including Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</p>
        <p>Some of those who set up their tents in the fields around this town and then boarded shuttle buses to the courthouse said they had come to pay homage to a hero, a man who was willing to stand up to the forces of globalization and the American government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove, who has an amiable grin under his handlebar mustache, added to the carnival air by riding into Millau's main square with his nine co-defendants on a cart pulled by a tractor -- a not-so-veiled reference to the way the condemned once went to the guillotine.</p>
        <p>And when he finally climbed the courthouse stairs, he stood at the door with his fist raised long enough for the pack of news photographers to get good shots.</p>
        <p>Inside the courtroom, the defendants, dressed in sports shirts, laughed and joked as the charges were read and they were asked to respond to them. One, accused of spraying the McDonald's with orange paint, said he was only sorry he had not used green paint. Another,  accused of using a screwdriver to commit vandalism, acknowledged that he had, but said it was a small screwdriver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove, was a bit more serious. At one point he compared himself to Gandhi, saying that Gandhi, too, had been accused of violence in his day.  ''The dismantling of McDonald's was a strong action, symbolic and nonviolent,'' Mr. Bove told the court, adding that the fast-food giant's arrival in Millau was a ''provocation.''</p>
        <p>The trial is expected to last two days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove was a little-known farmer and union official until last August, when he and the nine other men took a tractor, pick axes and power saws to the local McDonald's. Mr. Bove said at the time that he was incensed by what he saw as the unfairness of the United States to tax French delicacies like Roquefort cheese and pate de foie gras in retaliation for Europe's decision not to import hormone-treated American beef.</p>
        <p>''That tax decision was outrageous,'' said Arianne Gurreau, a schoolteacher who was camping with her boyfriend. ''I think the judge needs to see that there are all these people who think what he did was correct. We are fighting for values here, for the right to care about what we eat.''</p>
        <p>Many came with their own fights inspired by Mr. Bove. ''What prompted us to come is the problem of water,'' said Giselle Joffre, a retired government worker. ''In our town it is terribly expensive because we are working with a big company. It is the same with all these multinationals doing what they want.''</p>
        <p>This was clearly not what many Millau residents had braced for. Most had seen pictures of protesters, including Mr. Bove, at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and feared that this demonstration would be just as disruptive.</p>
        <p>''People were so scared,'' said Christianne Chazal-Martin, the owner of a gift shop near the courthouse who decided to stay open. ''First one got talking and then another, and they went on and on about how bad it was going to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove's attack on the McDonald's here last August was only one of a number of assaults on the fast food chain, which is often a target of  anti-American protesters. But Mr. Bove became instantly famous when he was thrown in jail for it, and then refused to pay bail for three weeks in protest. Eventually, he did pay the bail with money supplied by a group of supporters, many of them American.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove faces charges that could result in a fine of as much as $70,000 and up to five years in jail. But it is considered unlikely that he or any of his co-defendants will serve any jail time for the vandalism, which resulted in $110,000 worth of damage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove's lawyers, including a former president of a prominent human rights organization, have lined up more than a dozen witnesses, most of whom are also farming advocates from other countries. Much of the first day was spent arguing about pictures of the McDonald's after the ransacking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bove's lawyers pointed out that some of the windows remained unbroken.</p>
        <p>Organizers of the demonstration had hoped to gather 30,000 people for the opening of the trial, though police officials said they believed the number was closer to half that. With speakers, a farmers' market and a free rock concert in the evening, however, there was plenty to do. Many said they came as much to have fun as to make a political statement.</p>
        <p>''We came first for the party,'' said Michael Phelippeau, 16, who came with his friend Dennis Roulleau and was wandering from booth to booth with his sleeping bag under his arm. ''but my father is a farmer, and I am here representing my family, too. We believe in what Mr. Bove believes in. We don't want the multinationals to tell us what to eat.''</p>
