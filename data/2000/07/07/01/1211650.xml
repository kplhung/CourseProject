        <p>Hyman Bookbinder letter hopes Ralph Nader will withdraw from presidential race and redeem his reputation for integrity</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You may well have a point regarding the role of Ralph Nader's ego in his campaign activities as the Green Party candidate (editorial, June 30). But more pertinent are Mr. Nader's remarks about the candidates' ties to corporate interests.</p>
        <p>Aside from the campaign rhetoric and issue differences, both parties' candidates are subject to these influences at the public's expense. These two candidates do not offer the ''clear-cut choice'' you suggest; whichever candidate is elected will result in more Beltway business as usual.</p>

        <p>It will take third-party attempts to create a grass-roots movement to reduce the two major parties' power at the polls for a significant change in the way this land is governed. Who can disagree that change is needed?  MILES LOTT  New York, June 30, 2000</p>
