        <p>Jealousy drives even great nations to do petty things. France offered an embarrassing demonstration of this truth earlier this week when it alone, of more than a 100 countries attending a conference on democracy held in Warsaw, refused to sign a final declaration of agreed principles.</p>
        <p>France helped launch the worldwide democracy movement with its 1789 Revolution against monarchy and feudal privilege. The ideas of freedom that drove that upheaval found expression in a charter of basic liberties issued the same year, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. The document asserted the equality of all citizens and their right to governments of their own choosing, proclaimed the liberty of opinion and expression, and demanded adherence to the rule of law. Its resonant claims inspired democrats throughout the late-18th-century world and reinforced the ideas of America's own, earlier revolution.</p>

        <p>Jealousy drives even great nations to do petty things. France offered an embarrassing demonstration of this truth earlier this week when it alone, of more than a 100 countries attending a conference on democracy held in Warsaw, refused to sign a final declaration of agreed principles.</p>
        <p>France helped launch the worldwide democracy movement with its 1789 Revolution against monarchy and feudal privilege. The ideas of freedom that drove that upheaval found expression in a charter of basic liberties issued the same year, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. The document asserted the equality of all citizens and their right to governments of their own choosing, proclaimed the liberty of opinion and expression, and demanded adherence to the rule of law. Its resonant claims inspired democrats throughout the late-18th-century world and reinforced the ideas of America's own, earlier revolution.</p>
        <p>The Warsaw declaration that France refused to sign on Tuesday reaffirms some of these very same principles for the 21st-century world. It provides that the basis of all government is ''the will of the people,'' that every person is entitled ''to equal protection of the law'' and ''freedom of thought, conscience and religion.'' If some of the fervor and purity of 1789 is missing, something perhaps even more valuable has been added. The governments of well over half the world's countries, including some whose democratic performance leaves something to be desired, have now committed themselves to a set of principles defining democratic society.</p>
        <p>France says that it could not join this list because it feels that designs for democracy cannot be imposed by well-meaning outsiders. But France's real problem seems to be the leading role played by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in convening the Warsaw democracy conference. Washington's prominence at Warsaw proved more than French pride could bear.</p>
