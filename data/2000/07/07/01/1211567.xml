        <p>In an off-the-rack world, Hong Kong remains stubbornly made-to-measure. Wander into any alleyway off the main shopping boulevard, Queen's Road, and you can order tailored suits, personalized Chinese scrolls, custom-designed furniture or handmade shoes.</p>
        <p>Tucked in one of these narrow streets -- behind locked doors on the eighth floor of a nondescript office building -- is Anthony S. Y. Wong's fertility clinic. For $2,450, Mr. Wong offers the ultimate in customized service: he helps prospective parents choose the sex of their children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong does not advertise, and the sign on his door identifies the clinic only as the Victory Medical Laboratory. But he is happy to discuss his treatment, which he says has had an 80 percent success rate in 100 births since the clinic opened in late 1993.</p>
        <p>''If a couple has a boy and wants a girl, we help to get them a girl,'' said Mr. Wong, a dapper 44-year-old with a master's degree in biochemistry and the trace of a British accent. ''If a couple has a girl and wants a boy, we help them get a boy. We think of this as a form of family planning.''</p>
        <p>As it happens, more than 90 percent of Mr. Wong's customers choose boys. That has drawn fierce criticism from doctors and politicians, who say he practices a reckless form of genetic engineering. Last week, Hong Kong's legislature passed a law banning sex selection, except in cases when it is necessary to prevent the transmission of a hereditary disease.</p>
        <p>But it will be a couple of months before the law takes effect. In the meantime, Mr. Wong says business is booming. The Gender Choice Center is the only clinic in Hong Kong that offers sex selection, and couples are rushing to sign up while they can still do it legally.</p>
        <p>In the process, they are laying bare a social phenomenon that is little-discussed but widely prevalent in Hong Kong: the determination to control virtually every facet of childbirth. From selecting the sex to scheduling the delivery -- down to the minute, never mind the day -- people here go to extraordinary lengths.</p>
        <p>Not far from Mr. Wong's clinic are Chinese medicine shops, which sell potions made from the antlers and tails of deer. By drinking these concoctions, men are supposed to become more virile and increase their chances of fathering a son. Couples also consult charts that predict the sex of a baby by cross-referencing the mother's age with the month of conception. A particularly popular one is said to come from the imperial palace of the Qing dynasty.</p>
        <p>''In Western culture, parents do not automatically want a boy,'' said Cyd Ho, a female legislator who opposes sex selection. ''But in Chinese culture, boys are still the precious gem, particularly in the eyes of the grandmother. We have to say 'no' to this form of gender discrimination.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong is unruffled. ''Sex selection among Chinese people is nothing new,'' he said. ''It has been going on for ages and ages. The government wants to stop the only method that has been proven effective.''</p>
        <p>There is plenty of disagreement about that. Mr. Wong's method, which was developed by an American doctor, Ronald J. Ericsson, rests on the assumption that sperm bearing the male, or Y, chromosome swim faster than sperm bearing the female, or X, chromosome. Dr. Ericsson's innovation was to place the sperm over an albumin-based medium, which has layers of increasing density.</p>
        <p>In theory, the sperm that make it to the bottom layer are mostly male. To increase the odds of a boy, sperm are distilled from that layer and used to inseminate the prospective mother. To increase the odds of a female baby, sperm are distilled from less dense layers.</p>
        <p>''There is no scientific proof that this works,'' said Kenneth Mao, a specialist in fertility. ''But it may improve your chances a bit.''</p>
        <p>Despite his skepticism, Dr. Mao opposes banning the procedure. He noted that in a few cases it might prevent abortions by couples desperate not to have a girl. The abortion rate for female babies is no higher in Hong Kong than in the United States. But elsewhere in China, boys are so highly prized that parents resort to abortion and infanticide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong said he had a code of ethics to prevent abuses. He asks couples to sign a pledge that they will not terminate the pregnancy if the procedure fails. And he says he does not permit couples to select the sex of their first baby. The procedure, he says, is meant to balance families with multiple children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong holds himself up as an example. He and his wife have two girls, and they dearly wanted a son. By the miracle of sorted sperm, he said, they had a boy, now 4.</p>
        <p>Critics say Mr. Wong's precautions are not enough. Without a ban, such as exists in Britain and some parts of the United States, disreputable clinics could set up shop like back-alley abortionists, they say. Even the spread of properly licensed clinics could lead to a population imbalance, given the Chinese mania for boys.</p>
        <p>''If we let this spread far and wide, Hong Kong will be full of boys,'' Ms. Ho said. ''Men will end up having to seek their wives outside Hong Kong.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the demographic implications, some critics say sex selection devalues childbirth in a city where people already treat it like a dentist's appointment, something to be penciled in months in advance. One obstetrician here said she has lost patients by refusing to deliver their babies by Caesarean section at the precise time dictated by a master of feng shui, the ancient art of choosing auspicious locations and dates for harmonious balance.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it good enough just to have a baby?'' asked Mak Chung Man, a Chinese herbalist who treats infertile couples. ''To control the gender is asking too much. It's like going to a casino and betting on certain chips.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Wong, he said he would abide by the law. But he noted that it did not prohibit artificial insemination -- merely the sorting of sperm. So could he move that part of his operation to nearby Macao?</p>
        <p>''You're giving me ideas,'' he said quietly.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 5, 2000, Wednesday  A caption on Saturday with an article about a fertility clinic in Hong Kong that says it can help parents choose the sex of their children referred incorrectly to the man who runs the clinic, Anthony S. Y. Wong. As the article noted, he has a master's degree in biochemistry; he is not a doctor.</p>
