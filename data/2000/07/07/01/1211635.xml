        <p>A milestone in what some people have called the miracle of 125th Street was reached yesterday when the long-awaited Magic Johnson Theaters opened, bringing Harlem its first multiplex, with amenities like stadium seating to rival any movie house in the city. For the first time in many years, local residents will no longer have to travel to the Bronx or the Upper West Side to take in a first-run movie.</p>
        <p>But long before the first screening of ''Shaft'' yesterday afternoon, ripples from the nine-screen movie theater and the new $66 million Harlem U.S.A. shopping and entertainment complex of which it is a part were already spreading up and down the broad street that serves as Harlem's main thoroughfare. The six-level shopping center at 125th and Frederick Douglass Boulevard is home to several national chain stores, including an HMV record store, a Disney Store, an Old Navy store and a Modell's Sporting Goods store.</p>
        <p>National chain stores, fearful of crime and skeptical of whether enough buying power existed in low-income and minority neighborhoods, have long shunned communities like Harlem. Now retailers across the country are closely watching Harlem U.S.A. to see if the ambitious project will succeed.</p>
        <p>One regional retailer that has responded to the new shopping center is the aptly named Lazarus, a 40-year-old children's clothing store one block east of the new shopping center. Last year, the owners spent $500,000 to renovate the store, which has a new multicolored sign, a brightly lighted interior and a clean and up-to-date appearance. Harlem U.S.A. had a lot to do with the store's makeover, said George Adams, the general manager for 20 years.</p>
        <p>''The street came back alive,'' he said.  Mr. Adams said he was not worried about competition from Old Navy because his store had catered to the same families for three generations and emphasized personal service.</p>
        <p>Signs of vitality are everywhere on 125th Street, from the recently added bright red paint on the KFC outlet across the street from Harlem U.S.A. to the new or spruced up clothing stores like Ashley Stewart, Scheme and Avenue. Pedestrians crowd the sidewalks, and there are long lines at the cash registers.</p>
        <p>Some shoppers said they could scarcely believe the transformation. ''I used to think, maybe it's all talk, talk, talk,'' said Julie Duncan, a retired telephone service clerk who has lived in Harlem all her 53 years, ''but then it came to light.''</p>
        <p>Vacant spaces began disappearing and rents began climbing about three years ago when it became clear that the shopping center would actually be built, said Barbara Askins, the president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District. Annual rents in the area around the shopping center have doubled and now average $60 to $70 a square foot, she said.</p>
        <p>But even with the new facades, no one would mistake 125th Street for the shopping corridor along Third Avenue in the 60's. Rhythm and blues and salsa music permeate the air and street vendors peddle a wide range of goods, from books and compact discs to hand-painted tiles and flavored ices.</p>
        <p>There is much more to come. A complex with national retailers is planned for a site between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and a section of Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard, and excavation has begun for a building on Lexington Avenue that will house a Seaman's furniture store and a Duane Reade drug store. That site is cater-cornered to a Pathmark -- Harlem's first full-service supermarket in three decades -- which has flourished since it opened in April 1999.</p>
        <p>The last large remaining unoccupied parcel on 125th Street recently changed hands for the unheard-of price of $5 million, said Geoffrey Canada, the chief executive of Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, a nonprofit agency whose board members include Stanley Druckenmiller, an associate of the financier George Soros. Mr. Canada said the Rheedlen Centers will move its headquarters to the new 26,000-square-foot site from 107th Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>Farther west, the food purveyor Citarella is planning a 100,000-square-foot warehouse on 124th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and a store in the old Tastee Cake factory at 126th Street and Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>After years of disappointments, development in Harlem is proceeding with breathtaking speed, generating many hundreds of jobs and changing people's lives in small ways as well as large ones. For example, Ms. Askins said, Harlem residents previously had to leave the neighborhood to find the weight-lifting equipment that Modell's carries or a gym like the branch of the New York Sports Club that recently opened at Harlem U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Not every recent development project in the neighborhood has succeeded. East River Plaza, an East Harlem shopping center that would be anchored by a Costco warehouse store and a Home Depot, has stalled because of a lack of financing for a $30 million parking garage.</p>
        <p>A plan to build a 10-screen multiplex on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue was scrapped after United Artists backed out. The developer, Blumenfeld Development Group, was unable to find a replacement because the movie theater industry is retrenching after several years of rapid expansion. Loews Cineplex, which owns half of the Magic Johnson Theaters in Harlem, is closing theaters in other markets. But Marc J. Pascucci, a senior vice president of Loews, said that in contrast to the rest of the country, Manhattan remains underserved by movie theaters, based on population.</p>
        <p>Tickets at the new multiplex will cost $9.50, the same price Loews charges at its other Manhattan theaters. ''This is an expensive city to do business in,'' Mr. Pascucci said.</p>
        <p>Randy Dillard, an unemployed brick mason who has five young children, said, ''It's a little steep.'' But even though he does not expect to patronize the new theater very often, Mr. Dillard said he thought the changes in Harlem were ''very good for the community.''</p>
        <p>Others were less restrained. Laurence Jennings, the development director for Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement, an interfaith organization representing 75 churches and mosques, said the new movie theater had vast symbolic importance to the neighborhood. ''It sends a message of upliftedness and a sense of pride and well-being,'' he said. ''I don't think you can encase it in a few words.''</p>
