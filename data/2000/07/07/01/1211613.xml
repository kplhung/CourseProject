        <p>The city will pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit filed by a former deputy police commissioner who said she had been forced out of her job after refusing to revise a report that criticized police officials for their handling of a sexual harassment case, according to court papers filed yesterday.</p>
        <p>The city's agreement to pay was contained in a judgment entered in United States District Court in Manhattan on behalf of the former commissioner, Sandra M. Marsh.</p>
        <p>It was the second time in two weeks that the city lost a judgment based on the management of the Police Department. On June 15, a federal jury awarded $1.2 million to 24 black officers, finding that their transfer into the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn after the torture of Abner Louima was discriminatory because it was based on their race.</p>
        <p>The agreement with Ms. Marsh ended a federal civil rights lawsuit that had embarrassed the department, which shortly before Ms. Marsh's ouster pledged to improve its handling of sexual harassment cases. The case also focused attention on what critics say is the practice of senior police officials closing ranks to protect one another.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marsh had served as the deputy commissioner for equal employment opportunity and was responsible for investigating complaints of harassment within the department. She joined the department as an assistant trials commissioner in 1985, and at the time of her lawsuit, she was also the department's highest-ranking black official and only black deputy commissioner.</p>
        <p>While the city has agreed to pay her $1 million and cover her lawyers' legal fees, it admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Marsh said in an interview that she believed the size of the sum the city was willing to pay was ''an acknowledgment that they did something terribly wrong here.''</p>
        <p>She said that she had been stunned by the department's handling of the sexual harassment case that led to her ouster and its efforts to protect the two officials whom she had criticized in her report. ''The message was, there are people who are protected, and there are people who are expendable and throwaways,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the city, the lawsuit also named Police Commissioner Howard Safir; the first deputy commissioner, Patrick E. Kelleher; the deputy commissioner for legal matters, George A. Grasso; and the two officials she criticized in her report, Assistant Chief Eugene S. Devlin III and Deputy Chief Phillip Erickson.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman said Mr. Safir and the police officials would have no comment and referred questions to the office of the city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hess would not discuss the details of the lawsuit, but said that ''for a variety of litigation-related reasons, we felt it was prudent for the city to settle this case.''</p>
        <p>Sexual harassment was such a serious problem in the Police Department that federal prosecutors in Manhattan brought a civil lawsuit against the agency in 1996, the first time the federal government had taken such action. The suit argued that tougher standards and more vigilant enforcement was needed to protect female officers and employees.</p>
        <p>Under the consent decree stemming from that suit, reached in June 1998, the department agreed to increase the staffing of its Office of Equal Employment Opportunity to 30 investigators from 20 and to begin mandatory programs to teach all officers and commanders procedures for preventing and reporting sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>It was in the midst of that lawsuit that Ms. Marsh filed a report on the handling of a bitterly disputed sexual harassment case in Staten Island brought against a police lieutenant.</p>
        <p>In her report, Ms. Marsh ultimately ruled that the underlying harassment charges against the lieutenant were unfounded. But she criticized Chief Devlin, then the top police commander in Staten Island, for retaliating against the complaining officer by arranging an undesirable change in shifts, the lawsuit said. And when the officer's supervisor objected to making the change, Chief Devlin had the supervisor transferred to a lesser command, according to the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In the report, Ms. Marsh said that Chief Devlin had been ''only slightly cooperative'' during the course of the investigation and ''evasive in his answers, and at times hostile; this behavior is not in keeping with any commander who truly had justifiable reasons to relieve a subordinate commander and had the evidence to justify his decision.''</p>
        <p>She also said in the report that Chief Devlin's aide, Assistant Chief Erickson, made false statements during the investigation, an offense for which he could have been fired.</p>
        <p>That initial sexual harassment case led to another federal lawsuit brought by six police officers. In that suit, which is pending, the officers also allege retaliation by Chief Devlin and other police officials, and contend that women who complained about sexual harassment become the target of department investigators.</p>
        <p>''We have said all along that Commissioner Safir's termination of Deputy Commissioner Marsh and his rejection of her report was nothing more than an attempt to whitewash charges of sex harassment and retaliation brought by the six Staten Island police officers,'' said Jeffrey L. Goldberg, who represents five of the officers in the pending suit. ''The city's settlement with Ms. Marsh confirms their charges.''</p>
