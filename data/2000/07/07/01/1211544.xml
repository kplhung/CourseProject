        <p>Re ''Urban Menace Stalks Street in Diapers,'' by John Tierney (Big City column, June 24):</p>
        <p>Granted, Mr. Tierney and his friends ought to be able to have a fine meal in peace, but the unnatural separation and institutionalization of human beings at every stage of development, in places like day care, creates unpleasant children who become unpleasant adults.</p>

        <p>Granted, Mr. Tierney and his friends ought to be able to have a fine meal in peace, but the unnatural separation and institutionalization of human beings at every stage of development, in places like day care, creates unpleasant children who become unpleasant adults.</p>

        <p>Children who are loved by their families, integrated into appropriate social lives and embraced by community culture are a joy and benefit to all.</p>
