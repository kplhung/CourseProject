        <p>THE long drive leading to the water treatment plant is bordered by grass that is suspiciously green, with flowers that are clearly healthy and -- can that be a purely ornamental fountain recklessly gurgling water in the midst of one of the great droughts in Georgia history?</p>
        <p>''It's O.K.; it's all done with recycled water,'' said Mike Leonard, the plant's general manager. ''I just wish we could get everyone to use it.''</p>
        <p>But it will probably be many years before the suburban homeowners of the South begin routinely soaking their gardens with used bath water. As serious as the drought is -- and in the last week it has edged farther into neighboring Alabama and South Carolina -- it is essentially a passing phenomenon, and the warnings of water managers like Mr. Leonard have not changed the basic instincts of residents of the Atlanta area to water their sprawling lawns for hours at a time. (The summer's strict watering restrictions have helped, though.)</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it is the region's stupendous growth, not its weather, that poses the most serious challenge to its water supply, putting the Atlanta-Fulton County Water Treatment Plant on the front lines of the effort to keep the region of 3.2 million people from running dry. The ring of suburbs around Atlanta has been one of the fastest-growing settlements in American history, and the State of Georgia says that at the current rate of growth, the region will exceed its water capacity in 2030.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard, himself a suburbanite with a browning lawn, has seen that growth firsthand at the helm of a gleaming, state-of-the-art plant that supplies drinking water to about 300,000 people in the section of Fulton County north of  Atlanta. When the plant opened in 1991, it pumped 3.8 billion gallons a year; in 1999, its output more than quadrupled to 16.8 billion gallons. The county has had to expand the plant well ahead of schedule to meet the demand.</p>
        <p>''People just keep moving in, and it's all centered right in our area,'' said Mr. Leonard, relaxed in a polo shirt while millions of gallons of treated water flowed to the region's faucets in pipes beneath his office. ''And when summer comes, they turn on the timers on their watering systems and just let them run. This summer, we really felt it.''</p>
        <p>About half of warm-weather water consumption in a suburban area like North Fulton is poured directly on lawns and gardens, making suburbanites much bigger water consumers than their city counterparts. Faced with an extremely dry April and May, homeowners who rely on the plant turned on their hoses and did not stop, and Mr. Leonard's plant was often unable to keep up with demand. The big computer screen in his office, which shows graphic representations of storage tanks and pipelines, spent several days this spring flashing alarms about dangerously low water pressure.</p>
        <p>The plant and the distribution network rushed to keep up, but many homes in the county had only a trickle of water. A major fire  could have caused a disaster.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Leonard's urging, the Fulton County areas outside Atlanta quickly imposed a ban on watering between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m., but it was not enough. Now the county has one of the strictest bans in the state: outdoor watering can be done only between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., and then only on alternate days.</p>
        <p>''It's working,'' he said. ''For now, we're doing O.K. I've been telling people, 'Dirty's beautiful. If you don't wash your car, you get a red badge of courage.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard gets to work around 6 each morning preparing for more distribution headaches, but his more pressing concerns are for the future. Every drop pumped by his plant is sucked directly from the adjacent Chattahoochee River, the principal water source for a region without underground aquifers from which to draw. Most of the other counties and cities farther downstream also draw from the river and are also planning to step up their use, while Alabama and Florida are threatening a legal battle if Georgia does not begin to reduce its reliance on that river and others.</p>
        <p>TO save water, high-technology plants like the one in North Fulton will have to begin more processing of treated sewage water, sending it out to be consumed. But at the same time, the accelerating development in the region is filling the river with sediment and pollution, making it harder to treat.</p>
        <p>''To make it past the year 2030, we're going to have to rely on greater treatment technologies,'' said Pat Stevens, the environmental planning chief at the Atlanta Regional Commission, the area's planning body. ''It puts a lot of pressure on these plant managers to come up with solutions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard, the 51-year-old father of two daughters, is an Atlanta native who spent his summers as a teenager working for the city's water department, later studying chemistry and business at Mercer University. He has since become an expert on water quality, serving as drinking water enforcement chief for the  Environmental Protection Agency before coming to work for Fulton County in 1990. Much of his job involves finding new ways to use chemicals and filtering techniques to keep the water pure, like selling cakes of dried river sediment as compost instead of sending them downstream for another county to treat.</p>
        <p>But he has also become an evangelist for water conservation, urging businesses to spend money on water-recycling devices, planting drought-tolerant grasses and shrubs around his home and -- since the watering ban -- making a nuisance of himself around his Alpharetta neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I used to drive around my neighborhood wondering why all those people were pouring all that perfectly nice drinking water onto the ground,'' he said. ''Now I just turn them in.''</p>
