        <p>New York City's public school system needed qualified teachers willing to work in its most downtrodden districts. Jonathan Bassoff wanted just such a job.</p>
        <p>Though raised in Colorado and schooled in Iowa, Mr. Bassoff wanted to teach in Harlem, just as his mother had done before the family moved west. Shortly after receiving his master's degree in education last year at New York University, Mr. Bassoff took a job at Community School 200 on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bassoff, 26, is not teaching there anymore. This spring, two sixth-grade boys were charged with raping one of Mr. Bassoff's fourth-grade students in a school stairwell. Days later, Mr. Bassoff was fired for what his termination letter, without elaboration, called ''egregious'' conduct, and the school's principal and assistant principal were demoted and reassigned elsewhere.</p>
        <p>That a 9-year-old girl could be raped by two 12-year-olds in a school stairwell demonstrates on its face that Community School 200 is not like most American schools. But the school's daily disorder  and the troubled backgrounds of many of its students also highlight the obstacles facing the best-intentioned recruits.</p>
        <p>Before the rape, teachers say, C.S. 200 was a place where students blithely walked out of classrooms and wandered the halls, and where administrators did not respond to teachers' appeals to stop them. Novice instructors were promised mentors to coach and acclimate them to such challenges as maintaining control of a classroom, but the teachers say they would seldom see the mentors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bassoff and other teachers say the rape occurred when the 9-year-old girl and her classmates were supposed to be in the lunchroom under the supervision of other school employees. Mr. Bassoff had left them there before going to lunch himself. Even before classes began, Mr. Bassoff said, he found little support from the school's leadership. After attending a workshop last July to learn about the school's reading curriculum, Mr. Bassoff said, he was told that a different reading program would be used. Promised that the new textbooks would be available in August to allow him to prepare for the first day of school, Mr. Bassoff received none. On the first day of school in September, the school's principal, John A. Diopoulos, told him to use any books he could find in the school's closets, Mr. Bassoff said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bassoff arrived at the school, the fourth grade already had a reputation for unruliness. Vondora Jordan, whose daughter was one of Mr. Bassoff's students and who regularly visited the school as president of the Parents' Association, said Mr. Bassoff's class ''was known as the worst.''</p>
        <p>''I thought Mr. Bassoff was an excellent teacher,'' she said. ''He did what he could in the classroom. But he didn't have an aide, and it was hard to control those students.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bassoff concedes he is not a tough disciplinarian. ''It's not in my nature,'' he said. ''But I feel most days I had pretty good control of the class. The students knew I was a first-year teacher, and they tested my limits.'' But he also said that the school did little to help him. Though he was promised a mentor, the mentor visited him only twice, he said.</p>
        <p>Slim, with jet-black hair and sunken, red-rimmed eyes, Mr. Bassoff said he believed students might have treated him differently if he were more physically imposing. But he said he drew some comfort from the fact that the school's other first-year teachers were having their limits tested as well, a problem common to new teachers everywhere.</p>
        <p>During a faculty meeting just weeks before the alleged rape, one first-year teacher, Archie Manning, asked what -- short of physically restraining a student -- he could do when someone decided to leave class. He said he knew the procedure was to call the principal's office and report it, but that rarely seemed to result in anything that discouraged repeat incidents.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Grubbs, a third-grade teacher who was at the meeting, said Mr. Diopoulos, the school's principal, and Dr. Agnes Howell, the assistant principal, had two reactions. First, they said, students should not leave class. And second, if the teacher was in control, students would behave.</p>
        <p>''Essentially, they gave no answer,'' Ms. Grubbs said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diopoulos, who was demoted to an assistant principal and has been reassigned to Public School 92 in Harlem, declined to answer questions about his tenure at C.S. 200. ''I tried the best I could for those children,'' he said. ''Some people are irritated because they weren't doing what they should be doing. I guess they're getting their licks in.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Howell said that she did give extensive support to Mr. Bassoff and other first-year teachers, helping them plan lessons and sometimes sitting in on classes. Now working in the District 5 office, she said she believes she was unjustly removed.</p>
        <p>Whatever help Mr. Bassoff received, it did not appear to prepare him for what unfolded on Monday, April 10. That morning, Mr. Bassoff was told that three sixth-grade boys would be sitting in his fourth-grade class -- a common practice when a teacher was absent, because the school had trouble finding substitutes.</p>
        <p>Late that morning, two of Mr. Bassoff's fourth-grade girls, including the girl who the authorities say was later raped, stood up and announced they were leaving. They had already repeatedly asked to be excused for what Mr. Bassoff said were flimsy reasons. As the girls walked out, he told them to come back, even following them into the hallway. Then, rather than leave roughly 30 students unattended to pursue the 2, he used a classroom phone to call the principal's office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diopoulos was not in the building that day. But the secretary who answered said she would alert the assistant principal, Mr. Bassoff said. He returned to teaching, assuming the problem would be dealt with.</p>
        <p>Roughly 15 minutes later, one of the sixth-grade boys slipped out of class. Mr. Bassoff said he did not notice immediately, but when he did and asked the other sixth graders where the student went, they told him the boy had gone to eat lunch with other sixth graders.</p>
        <p>''The mistake I made was not calling down to the office then,'' Mr. Bassoff said. He said he did not believe that would have solved any problem, but he thought that oversight sealed his fate.</p>
        <p>At the time, the situation seemed to resolve itself; all three students returned to class about 20 minutes later, at roughly 12:05 p.m., he recalled. He asked where they had been, but was not troubled by the lack of a credible explanation; after all, the students were in class, seemingly unharmed.</p>
        <p>In fact, however, trouble had already begun. According to reports from the police and the Board of Education, during that absence one of the girls was coerced into sex by the sixth-grade boy in a school stairwell.</p>
        <p>At 12:40 p.m., Mr. Bassoff said, he took his class to the lunchroom, leaving them, as he did every day, in the charge of a lunchroom attendant. At about 1:15 p.m., a teacher was alerted by a student that something was happening to a girl in the stairwell. The same girl who earlier had been coerced into sex was now being forced into sex by two different boys, the authorities later said.</p>
        <p>The girl was taken to the office, and later that day the three boys were arrested. Charges were later dropped against the boy involved in the first incident; the other two, who the authorities said were involved in the lunchtime incident, have been charged with statutory rape.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Bassoff's view, he was a convenient scapegoat for the failings of others. ''I chose to teach in Harlem for the challenge and because it was a place where they needed teachers,'' he said. ''I had this idealistic notion of wanting to help kids in a tough area.'' But, he said, ''I've never been told what actions I committed that must be so egregious.''</p>
        <p>Thelma Baxter, superintendent of Community School District 5, which encompasses Harlem and includes C.S. 200, declined to discuss the specifics of Mr. Bassoff's dismissal, saying only that ''everyone involved had due process.''</p>
        <p>''None of this was arbitrary and capricious,'' she said. ''But really aggressive action was taken to restore the school to a productive learning environment.''</p>
        <p>The principal and assistant principal were reassigned, rather than fired, in part because they had tenure in their former, lower-ranking positions. But Mr. Bassoff, as an untenured teacher, could be dismissed without lengthy hearings.</p>
        <p>Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor, declined to be interviewed for this article. After the attack occurred, he visited the school and said publicly that the people responsible would be dealt with harshly. Karen Crowe, his spokeswoman, said: ''It was clear from the reports he received that the teacher did mishandle a situation that led to a sexual assault. The teacher was interviewed by both board and district staff, who felt he lacked the skills needed to control his class. For that reason, the chancellor supported the superintendent in her decision.''</p>
        <p>Since the rape charges, the girl and the boys involved have been transferred to other schools. Parents of other students interviewed last week outside C.S. 200 said that security was tightened, extra administrators were added and the general atmosphere at the school had improved. ''The kids are not fighting like they used to,'' said Yolanda Boone, whose son just completed the third grade. ''We got what we needed.''</p>
        <p>Even before his dismissal, Mr. Bassoff already had doubts about how long he would remain in the Harlem school. Near the end of 1999, he got engaged; his fiancee, a graduate student at Teachers College at Columbia University, wanted to return to Colorado, where they both grew up. Given his experience here, he said he now had no choice but to leave New York. He has received a job offer from a school district near Denver.</p>
        <p>''I was a first-year teacher, learning on the job,'' he said. ''Considering the circumstances in the school and the amount of support I did not receive, I look back and feel that I did all that I could.''</p>
