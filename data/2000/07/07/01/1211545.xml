        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''To Some an Eyesore, to Others a Home'' (Op-Ed, June 24), Jay Weiser gets it wrong. Granted, Woody Allen's motives in opposing a high-rise in his backyard may have been self-interested, but some self-interested protests are worthy of everyone's support. Preserving one's neighborhood against development isn't Nimbyism; it's common sense.</p>

        <p>Moreover, acceding to every harebrained development scheme in the name of lowering rents is like believing that one more highway, bridge or tunnel will reduce traffic. Mr. Allen struck a blow not just for himself, but for many of us who love this city.</p>
