        <p>Comedy revues like ''It Ain't Over Till the First Lady Sings!'' tend to draw many of their laughs from the chic of recognition.</p>
        <p>In other words, the audience response is not so much a reflexive, gut-wrenching surrender to brilliant wit as it is a communal signal of understood references. Yes, the laughter seems to say, we know that Vice President Al Gore comes across as a stiff, that George W. Bush appears unlikely to qualify for Mensa, that President Clinton has strayed from his marital vows, that Hillary Rodham Clinton is ambitious.</p>

        <p>Comedy revues like ''It Ain't Over Till the First Lady Sings!'' tend to draw many of their laughs from the chic of recognition.</p>
        <p>In other words, the audience response is not so much a reflexive, gut-wrenching surrender to brilliant wit as it is a communal signal of understood references. Yes, the laughter seems to say, we know that Vice President Al Gore comes across as a stiff, that George W. Bush appears unlikely to qualify for Mensa, that President Clinton has strayed from his marital vows, that Hillary Rodham Clinton is ambitious.</p>
        <p>While such shared reaction to the comic buffeting of obvious targets may contribute to an atmosphere of pleasure, the show as a whole remains uneven. Nevertheless, there is something to be said in this presidential election year for the salutary effect of the kind of irreverence that prompts voters to remember that all too often high office has been occupied by low clowns.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there are genuine pleasures in ''It Ain't Over,'' particularly the two bright, original segments titled ''Lirty Dies,'' in which Bill Strauss turns the language backward in frequently suggestive fashion as he runs through 20th-  and 21st-century history, noting political scandals and other milestones, like the Great Depression, when ''nobody had a pickle in his nocket.''</p>
        <p>''It Ain't Over Till the First Lady Sings!,'' which is playing at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row until Sept. 2, is another production of Capitol Steps, the band of satirists who trace their beginnings to 1981, when three Senate staff members staged some topical song parodies and skits for a Christmas  show.</p>
        <p>On any given night in the current run, a handful of the troupe's constituents take to the stage, accompanied by a pianist, and perform the material conceived, written and directed by Mr. Strauss and Elaina Newport.</p>
        <p>The content may change from performance to performance, but on a recent night, the up-to-the-minute barbs, nicely sung and acted, poked fun at Rick Lazio (''all I want is a Senate seat''), his rival, Mrs. Clinton (''don't cry for me, Giuliani''), Vladimir Putin (puttin' on a blitz''), gasoline prices (''what kind of fuel am I?''), commencement addresses, and Mr. Bush as a contestant on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' Sample puzzler: ''The President of France is the leader of which of these countries?''</p>
        <p>But ''Guns,'' a song about the National Rifle Association's plans for a theme restaurant in Times Square, fails to develop beyond its original perception, and a routine about the tobacco industry wheezes figuratively as well as literally. Some holdovers from earlier Capitol Steps shows still work, like ''Pakistani Bang Bang,'' which uses ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' to grapple with Pakistan and India's relations with each other and with the United States; and ''Hebron,'' which looks at Israel's West Bank settlements by using the lyrics ''I'm in Hebron'' to the tune of ''Dancing Cheek to Cheek.''</p>
        <p>''It Ain't Over Till the First Lady Sings!'' may not be a dazzling revue, but in the imperfect world of imperfect people that its comedy deals with, it provides a bright, sassy reflection.</p>
