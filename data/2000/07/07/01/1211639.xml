        <p>THE Mets needed this miracle.</p>
        <p>Silly as it may sound on one night of a 162-game season, the Mets made a major claim on posterity.</p>
        <p>The Mets were down, 8-1, going into the bottom of the eighth inning last night at Shea Stadium. The Braves were on the verge of taking the Mets' heart. They had already trounced them on Thursday, and now they were moving in for the kill. Atlanta manhandled Mike Hampton, the multimillion-dollar pitcher whose sole purpose in baseball life was to carry the Mets over the top. Melvin Mora, the rock-solid everything player, made an error last night and Mike Piazza made his second in three days.</p>
        <p>More than that, Atlanta was toying with the Mets. The Atlanta players were on the bench laughing and guffawing, sitting on the top step of the dugout, backs turned to the Mets as if the game were over.</p>
        <p>Then came the eighth inning, when the Mets loaded the bases with two out. In a fitting turnabout for a team that was eliminated from the National League Championship Series by Atlanta on a bases-loaded walk, the Mets scored three runs on three consecutive walks. They tied the game, 8-8, on a two-run single by Edgardo Alfonzo and then finally won it on a three-run homer by Piazza.</p>
        <p>Last night's victory did so much to cut through a depressing funk that was enveloping this franchise.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, a man wearing a jacket and a badge approached me and asked how he might get the key to Mr. Wilpon's suite and Mr. Doubleday's suite. Two other men were holding a pair of dogs by leashes. The man with the jacket and badge explained that they were part of the New York City Police Department's bomb detail. ''We have to sweep Mr. Wilpon's suite, but we need the key.''</p>
        <p>Why he was asking me how to get the key, I had no idea, but searching for bombs in the suites of the Mets' co-owners was unsettling. With walkie-talkies, the police officers left with the dogs to sweep other parts of Shea Stadium but said they would return.</p>
        <p>Take me out to the ballgame.</p>
        <p>Outside Shea, waves of New York City police officers lined up and received instructions for deployment inside the stadium.</p>
        <p>All this because a 25-year-old Atlanta Braves relief pitcher named John Rocker pushed the limits of his Constitutional right to free speech.</p>
        <p>The dogs went sniffing and the police officers went to their posts.</p>
        <p>This was Day 2 of a four-game Atlanta-Mets series. But the men with blue coats and badges and dogs created an atmosphere that intruded on the hallowed space of a baseball game.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day Bobby Valentine, the Mets manager, finished his pregame interview with reporters, looked around the stadium and shook his head. He said the Rocker affair made him feel uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>''I have a 17-year-old who just brought three friends up from Texas,'' he said. ''I gave them free rein, after he spent a month in the city, battling the subway when he's downtown, taking the No. 7 coming out here, leaving when he wants to leave. Going to Times Square, going to SoHo on his own, with his buddy.</p>
        <p>''Now their parents are in Texas going: 'What's this idiot doing with my kids? They took the train home from the game.' And just the fact that my wife had to say 'Are you sure it's O.K. for them to do it?' bugs me.</p>
        <p>''Freedom is a wonderful thing,'' Valentine added. ''People say it's not free, but it definitely isn't for anyone to take away from anyone else.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think this police state is what we're all about,'' Valentine said. ''I understand protecting the individual, but the guarded statements, closed clubhouses -- what is all that?''</p>
        <p>Rocker made disparaging remarks about Valentine, New York City and its ethnic groups in a Sports Illustrated article six months ago. ''I almost think he was saying what he thought was cool, taking that persona when he runs out of that bullpen, what I think of as a W.W.F. mentality.'</p>
        <p>Baseball has apparently cautioned the Mets and the Braves to watch what they say.</p>
        <p>''We're held to a higher standard than everyone else,'' Valentine said. ''Our sport and the rest of society are going in different directions. We're under more restrictions as the rest of society becomes more free. What is that? I feel resentment of the fact that I do feel restrained.''</p>
        <p>There was something unsettling about all the police, the bomb-sniffing dogs, the layers of cameras. The scene was depressing. Everyone had been diminished.</p>
        <p>Last night there was some illumination. The Mets needed this miracle. We all did.</p>
