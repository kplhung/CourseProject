        <p>With Lou Lamoriello returning to run the Devils, Larry Robinson decided he was coming back, too. Robinson agreed yesterday to a new contract as head coach, a day after Lamoriello agreed to continue running the Devils under the ownership of the YankeeNets.</p>
        <p>Robinson replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games left in the season, and then led the team to the Stanley Cup. He had expressed reluctance about returning next season if Lamoriello did not continue to run the team.</p>
        <p>Robinson had also indicated that he was unsure if he wanted to work as a head coach anywhere else, but he said yesterday that his success with the Devils and the support of Lamoriello had changed his mind.</p>
        <p>''Working with Lou was the best thing that ever happened to me,'' Robinson said in a conference call. ''We became more than a hockey team, we became a family. I never worked with a man of his experience who believed in the same things I did about the way a team should be run.''</p>
        <p>Robinson agreed to a two-year contract as head coach. The agreement also calls for him to serve the team for an additional two years as a consultant.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello agreed Thursday to stay on as the Devils' president and general manager for an unspecified number of years under the YankeeNets, which bought the team last February.</p>
        <p>Robinson was the top assistant to Jacques Lemaire when the Devils won their first Stanley Cup in 1995. He then was head coach of the Los Angeles Kings for four years, before returning to the Devils last summer as an assistant coach.</p>
        <p>''Larry was a big part of both our Stanley Cup championships,'' Lamoriello said. ''He brings leadership and a wealth of hockey knowledge to our club. We feel that both our veterans and younger players will continue to benefit from his experience.''</p>
        <p>In the Eastern Conference finals against the Flyers, the Devils fell behind by three games to one. Robinson was given substantial credit for the team's comeback in the series.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of what we did,'' Robinson said, ''but we cannot rest on our laurels. Everybody will be after us the way we were after Dallas.'' The Devils dethroned the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>Robinson, who was driving to Binghamton, N.Y., yesterday to visit Jacques Caron, the goaltending coach, said that Caron and Slava Fetisov would return as assistant coaches. He said he was not sure about Bob Carpenter's plans.</p>
