      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court filed suit in Little Rock today asking a state court to enforce its recommendation that President Clinton be stripped of his law license for falsely denying under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>The filing set in motion the preparation for a full-fledged trial in a Little Rock courtroom, perhaps as early as this fall, over Mr. Clinton's fitness to be a lawyer.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit before the Pulaski County Circuit Court became inevitable last month when the committee said that the president should be disbarred for what it said was ''serious misconduct'' in his testimony in the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against him by Paula Corbin Jones.</p>
        <p>David E. Kendall, a Washington lawyer who is representing Mr. Clinton in the Arkansas case, said tonight, ''We fundamentally disagree with the complaint filed today and will defend vigorously against it.''</p>
        <p>The case will be heard without a jury. It was first randomly assigned by a computer today to Judge John Ward of the Pulaski County Circuit Court. But Judge Ward immediately withdrew from the case, noting that Mr. Clinton first appointed him to the bench in 1988, when Mr. Clinton was governor of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>Judge Ward said in an interview that ''it would create an impression of impropriety should I accept that case.''</p>
        <p>The case will be sent back to the computer to be assigned to someone else, but court officials acknowledged that might not be an easy task.</p>
        <p>Judges in Arkansas are elected, but governors fill unexpected vacancies in the middle of judicial terms. Because Mr. Clinton served as the state's governor for many years, he was able to appoint dozens of state judges.</p>
        <p>Even those he did not appoint ran for their seats in partisan elections and are therefore either associated with the Democratic or Republican Parties. Some of the other seven judges on the court suggested that they would ask to be excused from presiding over a trial involving Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The president's lawyers have 30 days to respond to the formal request for disbarment. Court officials said that would mean that the trial could occur as early as this fall.</p>
        <p>But Prof. John DiPippa of the University of Arkansas Law School at Little Rock said tonight that issues like finding a suitable and willing judge were only one factor that could delay the trial. In addition, Professor DiPippa said Mr. Clinton's lawyers would be able to postpone the trial perhaps even until the president left office by filing various motions.</p>
        <p>If the trial occurred while Mr. Clinton was still president, he would probably not appear in his own behalf. When the committee reached its conclusion recommending disbarment, Mr. Clinton said his lawyers would mount a vigorous defense, but he would not participate personally while still in office.</p>
        <p>Professor DiPippa said that no matter what the judge decided, the ruling might be appealed directly to the State Supreme Court. He added that such cases were routinely appealed whether the trial judge decided for or against the lawyer.</p>
        <p>The heart of the case against Mr. Clinton involves his testimony during a January 1998 deposition in Paula Jones's sexual misconduct suit. In the presence of the federal judge presiding over the case, Susan Webber Wright, Mr. Clinton said that he had not had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>That August, he told a federal grand jury that he had, in fact, had an inappropriate intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Judge Wright cited Mr. Clinton for contempt of court, fined him and recommended that the State Supreme Court consider disciplinary action against him.</p>
