        <p>Arthur Browne, the senior staff member with the greatest longevity at The Daily News, resigned yesterday to take a job at an Internet company.</p>

        <p>Arthur Browne, the senior staff member with the greatest longevity at The Daily News, resigned yesterday to take a job at an Internet company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne, who began at The Daily News as a $119-a-week night copy boy in 1973 and had been named senior managing editor two years ago, would not disclose the name of the company he is joining or what his position would be. ''This is a business that has competition, and my role will be announced at the proper time, in the proper way for the business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne's departure is a significant one in the ranks of the newspaper's upper management. In March,  Edward Kosner, a former editor of Newsweek and Esquire magazines, was named editor in chief of the newspaper, becoming the fourth top editor in four years. A number of staff members have resigned since Mr. Kosner took the helm. In the last five weeks alone, the newspaper's deputy managing editor, the deputy general counsel, the features editor, the deputy features editor and at least two reporters have resigned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne, 49, worked with nine publishers and nine editors during his time at The Daily News. He is known, despite occasionally contentious clashes in the newsroom, as a solid judge of news with a predilection for investigative articles. His length of service has been poignantly evident in recent weeks as Mr. Browne made a number of toasts at parties for departing colleagues  whom Mr. Kosner, because of his recent arrival, did not know as well.</p>
        <p>Senior staff members said Mr. Browne's departure may have been brought about because he had been passed over too many times for the newspaper's top editorial position, and because he and Mr. Kosner do not have the same editorial sensibilities. Mr. Kosner, who has spent most of his career editing magazines, has an appetite for feature stories, while Mr. Browne has a more news-oriented tabloid background.</p>
        <p>''I don't think Ed and Art saw eye to eye in terms of investigations,'' said one senior staff member who has worked closely with both Mr. Kosner and Mr. Browne.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Browne said that Mr. Kosner is basically true to the traditional roots of The Daily News.</p>
        <p>''It is at its heart aimed at the middle-class New York reader, and no smart editor would try to mess around with too much,'' he said. ''It might boil down to, do you lead with John Rocker or Elian Gonzalez? Both answers are going to be O.K. One might be righter than the other, but that's not something I am going to violently disagree about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kosner said that he and Mr. Browne did not differ significantly in their approach to news. ''I think he is very talented and sometimes people want to change their lives,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Eve Burton, the newspaper's deputy general counsel who announced her resignation two weeks ago to join the legal staff at CNN, said that Mr. Browne's departure was a loss to the paper's editorial operations, as well as a symbolic loss for The Daily News and for Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the paper's owner.</p>
        <p>''Mort always wanted and needed him in the newsroom,'' Ms. Burton said. ''Arthur has history and he is an institution and everyone would agree that his news judgment has always been a great asset to Mort.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zuckerman was traveling and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Browne said that the frequent editorial transitions at The Daily News had little to do with his departure. ''I have been here through the turmoil of the big strike, through the bankruptcy, and through the death of Robert Maxwell,'' Mr. Browne said, referring to the former owner of the paper. ''I know what it is to live in a rather challenging and exciting world. But to me it was all background noise. O.K., sometimes very loud background noise. But we always got the paper out.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Browne said his decision was influenced by his desire to work in the Internet.</p>
        <p>''The whole dot-com world is going to be with us for the future,'' Mr. Browne said. ''Information delivery is going to increasingly happen on the Internet and I want to be out there doing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kosner said that he and Mr. Browne had not yet decided when Mr. Browne would leave the paper.</p>
