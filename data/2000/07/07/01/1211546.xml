        <p>Elvis was in the building on Thursday night at Irving Plaza. She had red hair and wore a purple tie-dye jacket, and called herself Wynonna Judd. The country star, making a rare club appearance to introduce her latest album, ''New Day Rising'' (Mercury Nashville), projected enough self-confidence and loony charisma to pass as a female reincarnation of the King. She even did the karate moves and muscle-flexing.</p>
        <p>Now, Elvis had some bad qualities, and so does Wynonna (like Mr. Presley, a first-name-only star). Her biggest vocal flaw revealed itself throughout Thursday's set: merely adequate breath control. Fudging the sustained notes in her cover of Joni Mitchell's ''Help Me,'' relying on her back-up singers when she got slightly winded, Wynonna revealed that even after 18 years in showbiz, she still sometimes pushes too hard. She's a belter and a growler, but sometimes that pedal-to-the-metal singing approach doesn't serve the vocal cords.</p>

        <p>Elvis was in the building on Thursday night at Irving Plaza. She had red hair and wore a purple tie-dye jacket, and called herself Wynonna Judd. The country star, making a rare club appearance to introduce her latest album, ''New Day Rising'' (Mercury Nashville), projected enough self-confidence and loony charisma to pass as a female reincarnation of the King. She even did the karate moves and muscle-flexing.</p>
        <p>Now, Elvis had some bad qualities, and so does Wynonna (like Mr. Presley, a first-name-only star). Her biggest vocal flaw revealed itself throughout Thursday's set: merely adequate breath control. Fudging the sustained notes in her cover of Joni Mitchell's ''Help Me,'' relying on her back-up singers when she got slightly winded, Wynonna revealed that even after 18 years in showbiz, she still sometimes pushes too hard. She's a belter and a growler, but sometimes that pedal-to-the-metal singing approach doesn't serve the vocal cords.</p>
        <p>This is a small quibble against someone with a far rarer talent than perfect timbre. Wynonna is one of those real stars who mix monumentalism with humanism; she cuts through her own big show to uncover raw feeling. This is one of her Elvis-like qualities -- she can't help being honest, at least in performance. Even unbearably trite songs like ''Testify to Love,'' from the ''Touched by an Angel'' soundtrack, became visceral when Wynonna claimed them.</p>
        <p>Her other link to Elvis is her ability to cross racial lines musically without seeming like a minstrel. Her uptempo songs were mostly unsanitized Memphis soul, far looser than most Nashville artists dare. Her new album's title track echoed the Wilson Pickett classic, ''Midnight Hour.'' During ''Who Am I Trying to Fool?'' she intoned a ''Hey baby'' worthy of Barry White. Clutching the hand of a smitten male fan -- and then kissing it -- during that song, she asserted herself as a stellar love-woman.</p>
        <p>The intimacy Wynonna established with  both her audience and her sometimes banal material, did not shrink her presence in the least. Wynonna could modestly allow her outstanding backup singers to go full-force during their designated solos, because even if her voice was smaller, her way with it was huge.</p>
        <p>Her sweeping charm overcame any weaknesses caused the set by superficial  Nashville songwriting. She even escaped blame for softening the words in her version of the Macy Gray song ''I Can't Wait to Meetcha'' and for singing the worn-out hymn ''How Great Thou Art.'' These choices were imperfect -- rather corny, very country. But, truthfully, Elvis made the same ones.</p>
