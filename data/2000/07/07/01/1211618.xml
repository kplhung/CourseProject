        <p>Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday that he planned to give district superintendents more power over spending, hiring and instructional policy as part of a major reorganization of the school bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy is also weighing a recommendation that he press the State Legislature to abolish the 32 community school boards, which have already lost many powers and have been frequently criticized as ineffective and corrupt. The recommendation was in a draft report submitted to Mr. Levy by one of several outside consulting firms and groups of school officials he has enlisted to help with the review.</p>
        <p>The New York Times obtained a copy of the draft report, which also recommended giving the district superintendents more power. Mr. Levy would not comment on the recommendation to abolish the community school boards, but he warned that all of the report's recommendations were preliminary. Many will not come to fruition, he said.</p>
        <p>''Everything is open to discussion,'' Mr. Levy said in an interview. ''That is what re-engineering is about. But these are by no means final recommendations.''</p>
        <p>William C. Thompson, president of the Board of Education, asked Mr. Levy in February for a ''top to bottom'' review of the board's administrative buildings and staff, to determine whether operations needed to be streamlined and, if so, how that  would be done. The request came as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was pressuring the board to sell its labyrinthine headquarters at 110 Livingston Street, cut its central staff and move into a smaller building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy promised at the time that the review would be finished by June. But in a letter to the seven board members yesterday, he said that he needed more time. The main reason, he said, was that he wanted to review the staff and functions of the superintendents' offices, too. There are 32 district superintendents, one for each community school district, as well as 6 high school superintendents and 6 others overseeing instruction and special education.</p>
        <p>''It has become clear that to revise central's structure without simultaneously reviewing the superintendencies would be an error,'' Mr. Levy wrote in the letter, which he also released to reporters. ''Accordingly, the review I have undertaken has extended considerably beyond the original charge.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said he hoped to make preliminary changes in the central administration and the superintendencies this fall, and more changes later in the school year. He said he did not want to make any immediate changes, because board officials and superintendents needed to focus on summer school for the next two months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said yesterday that he expected some layoffs in the board's central staff, and potentially in the district offices.</p>
        <p>One job that he described as ''problematic'' was that of five ''borough deputies to the chancellor,'' who are supposed to be liaisons between the district superintendents and the chancellor. The role of the borough deputies ''has never been adequately defined and today they are neither part of central nor close to the superintendents,'' Mr. Levy complained in his letter to the board members.</p>
        <p>Although it is still unclear exactly how Mr. Levy would expand the budgetary and hiring powers of the district superintendents, the draft report by one of four study groups recommended several options. One would give superintendents the power to purchase supplies and services from their choice of vendor, instead of from the central board, as they are now required to do.</p>
        <p>The study-group report also recommended that superintendents be given more power to hire teachers and other employees directly, instead of having the central board hire them and assign them to districts. In addition, it recommended stripping the central board of much of its power over high school budgets and instruction, and handing that power to the high school superintendents.</p>
        <p>The study-group report also recommended that the Board of Education allocate funds to the districts in the form of block grants, instead of earmarking specific amounts for specific programs. With block grants, the superintendents would have more flexibility to choose programs and decide how much they wanted to spend on each one.</p>
