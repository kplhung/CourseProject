        <p>Editorial on New York Legislature's recent, unaccustomed, burst of activity; reports that what unblocked usual petty stalemates remains political mystery, but hopes dusting of moderation and compromise will not blow away after election</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Albany is quiet this week after a frenzy of legislative activity unlike any seen for many years. With a budget approved early and a vital election a few months away, the Legislature squeezed in the time to approve almost 700 bills to go to Gov. George Pataki for signing. The list includes a strong gun control package, an important hate crimes bill, a bill requiring fire-safe cigarettes and another providing for public access to critical data about doctors and hospitals, to name only a few. Still, legislators failed to reform the campaign finance and ballot systems, revamp the antiquated Rockefeller drug laws and restructure the state courts.</p>
        <p>What unblocked the usual petty stalemates at the end of this year's legislative marathon remains a political mystery. But there was a little more fresh air and good political will wafting through the closed rooms where state laws are manufactured. After a bitter power struggle between Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and rival Assemblyman Michael Bragman, Mr. Silver began trying to keep members more informed, even soliciting their input at various stages in the deal-making. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, shuddering at the possibility that Democrats could take over his chamber after November's election, began leading his flock toward normally dormant political territory, finally approving a decent hate crimes bill being pushed for more than a decade by the Democrats. Governor Pataki angled for environmental improvements and gun control.</p>

        <p>What unblocked the usual petty stalemates at the end of this year's legislative marathon remains a political mystery. But there was a little more fresh air and good political will wafting through the closed rooms where state laws are manufactured. After a bitter power struggle between Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and rival Assemblyman Michael Bragman, Mr. Silver began trying to keep members more informed, even soliciting their input at various stages in the deal-making.

Governor Pataki angled for environmental improvements and gun control.</p>
        <p>The hope, of course, is that this dusting of moderation and compromise will not blow away after the election. There are still important bills to be passed. At the top of that list would be reform of a campaign finance system that has few real limits on contributions to individual candidates and no limits for donations to political parties. This is a need so basic it should serve as the rallying cry for any challengers in this year's election.</p>
