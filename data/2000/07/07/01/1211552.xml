        <p>The second Internet World Championship staged by OKbridge, with 186 teams entered from 47 countries, is already well advanced. The Doug Simson foursome that won last year is in contention in the Western Hemisphere half of the draw, which has been reduced to 10 other United States teams, 2 from Canada and 2 from Argentina. One of the American groups, captained by Dick Budd, has already reached the zonal finals.</p>
        <p>The other half of the draw consists mainly of European teams, from Britain, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Russia and Sweden. Australia and China are also in contention.</p>
        <p>The final will be in Birmingham, Ala., on Nov. 16. The teams will be present in person, but will continue to play on computer terminals.</p>
        <p>Sweden may be the team of destiny. Aided by luck on the diagramed deal, their players defeated Norway on Tuesday by the narrowest of margins and advanced to the European finals.</p>
        <p>In one room, Bjorn Wenneberg and P. G. Eliasson were North and South for Sweden, landing as shown in a precarious four-spade contract.</p>
        <p>The final raise to four spades was a bold move, since a shaky 4-3 fit was probable. North was encouraged by his club fit, and perhaps hoped that his partner's spade suit was stronger. As it was, the declarer needed an even trump split, which was not very likely: the negative double by the Norwegian star Geir Helgemo, West, hinted at a four-card spade suit.</p>
        <p>South won the opening lead of the heart king with the ace, and led a spade to the ace. When he played a second trump, East hopped up with the king and returned his last heart.</p>
        <p>South threw the diamond queen, allowing West to win with the queen. It did not matter what the defense did. West played a third heart, ruffed by his partner and overruffed. South drew the missing trump and ran his six club tricks to make the game.</p>
        <p>If the defense had played diamonds, South would still have succeeded, thanks to the favorable trump split.</p>
        <p>Notice that five clubs, in the obvious 6-2 fit, would have been hopeless. The defense would have taken two diamond tricks and one spade trick.</p>
        <p>In the replay the bidding began similarly, but West bid two hearts instead of making a negative double. North raised to three clubs, and East jumped aggressively to four diamonds, which ended the bidding.</p>
        <p>North-South led spades and defeated the contract by one trick. South had had no convenient opportunity to bid spades and match the remarkable Swedish result.</p>
        <p>Sweden gained 11 imps, just enough to win the match by 1 imp and advance to the next stage of the Internet World Championship.</p>
        <p>The American Contract Bridge League's Senior Trials, played in Las Vegas a week ago, were won by Kit Woolsey, Steve Robinson, Dan Morse, Bobby Wolff, John Sutherlin and John Mohan. They will represent the United States in the World Senior Teams in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in August.</p>
