        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio has collected roughly $4.5 million in donations since entering the New York Senate race six weeks ago, benefiting from the same antipathy toward his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, that helped propel the fund-raising of Mr. Lazio's predecessor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio took in almost as much as Mrs. Clinton in the three-month fund-raising period that ended yesterday, even though he began soliciting money only halfway through, according to figures released by the two campaigns. Mrs. Clinton collected $5.1 million.</p>

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio has collected roughly $4.5 million in donations since entering the New York Senate race six weeks ago, benefiting from the same antipathy toward his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, that helped propel the fund-raising of Mr. Lazio's predecessor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio took in almost as much as Mrs. Clinton in the three-month fund-raising period that ended yesterday, even though he began soliciting money only halfway through, according to figures released by the two campaigns. Mrs. Clinton collected $5.1 million.</p>
        <p>''We are very encouraged by the outpouring of support for Congressman Lazio and his mainstream message,'' a campaign spokesman, Michael Marr, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In a typical Senate race, Mr. Lazio's total for such a short span would be considering startling. But having entered the race very late -- Mr. Giuliani dropped out on May 19 to focus on his treatment for prostate cancer -- Mr. Lazio remains far behind Mrs. Clinton in financing.</p>
        <p>That could hinder Mr. Lazio, who is not well known, as he seeks to parry Mrs. Clinton's attempts to use aggressive advertising to cement a negative image of him.</p>
        <p>The question now is whether Mr. Lazio can continue reaping money at this pace or merely had an initial burst of donations after becoming the nominee.</p>
        <p>In addition to the $4.5 million that he has raised for his Senate campaign, Mr. Lazio had $3.5 million in the account for his House re-election campaign as of March 31. After spending $2.6 million, his campaign had $5.4 million in the bank as of yesterday, Mr. Marr said.</p>
        <p>It could not be determined whether the money was being spent as quickly as it was being received.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns are required to report their fund-raising statistics, including the identities of donors, to the Federal Election Commission by July 15.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is spending money as fast as she is collecting it. With the figure reported yesterday, Mrs. Clinton has now raised $17.9 million. She ended the last period on March 31 with $6.6 million, and finished this one with $6.4 million, her aides said, meaning that she spent slightly more than the $5.1 million that she raised in the period.</p>
        <p>When he abandoned the campaign in May, Mr. Giuliani had just broken the fund-raising record of $21 million set by a nonincumbent candidate for Senate, Oliver L. North, a Republican who lost a contest in Virginia in 1994.</p>
        <p>The spending record for the Senate is a moving target: Jon S. Corzine, a wealthy former investment banker, spent almost $35 million -- nearly all of it his own money -- to win the Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey last month. He is expected to spend much more in the general election against Representative Robert D. Franks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani excelled at using direct mail to harvest money from people around the nation who loathe Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazio is seeking to follow the same strategy.</p>
        <p>After pulling out of the race, Mr. Giuliani returned nearly $3 million in donations last week, enclosing a letter that asked that the money be sent to Mr. Lazio. The congressman's aides said they hoped to begin receiving that money in the coming days.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani campaign has a few million dollars left, and the mayor has not decided what to do with it. He is barred from giving it directly to Mr. Lazio's campaign but could donate it to a Republican committee that could help Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>With the release of the figures yesterday, both the Lazio and Clinton campaigns adopted the traditional stance of promoting their successes while trying to lower expectations for the future.</p>
        <p>''This is an extremely strong filing, and we are very pleased,'' said the Clinton campaign manager, Bill de Blasio. ''While we expect that Rick Lazio and the national Republican fund-raising machine will outraise us, we are very proud of the support we have received.''</p>
        <p>To which Mr. Marr responded: ''Hillary Clinton's complaints about the vast right-wing conspiracy continue. The fact is that the Lazio campaign is up against the awesome power of the White House, Clinton's Hollywood allies and various other special interests. But Congressman Lazio will prevail in this race because his mainstream record and message resonate with an overwhelmingly majority of New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday the race drew in Senator John McCain of Arizona, the former presidential candidate, who had campaigned for the mayor. Mr. McCain released a statement attacking Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats for spending the unregulated contributions known as soft money on behalf of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. McCain also promoted Mr. Lazio as a staunch advocate of overhauling the campaign finance system.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said, ''I guess Senator McCain must not know that Rick Lazio is one of the biggest soft money fund-raisers in Washington.''</p>
