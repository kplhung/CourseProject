        <p>A day after the police led Jelena Dokic's father away and Alexandra Stevenson accused one French player of a racial slur and another of pushing her mother, there was a warning issued to Damir Dokic and a mystified look on the face of Anne-Gaelle Sidot.</p>
        <p>Sidot was the player accused of pulling down the hat of Samantha Stevenson and pushing her at a recent tournament. In another incident, Alexandra and Samantha Stevenson said Sidot's boyfriend had cried out, ''Let's get her,'' after a practice session.</p>

        <p>A day after the police led Jelena Dokic's father away and Alexandra Stevenson accused one French player of a racial slur and another of pushing her mother, there was a warning issued to Damir Dokic and a mystified look on the face of Anne-Gaelle Sidot.</p>
        <p>Sidot was the player accused of pulling down the hat of Samantha Stevenson and pushing her at a recent tournament. In another incident, Alexandra and Samantha Stevenson said Sidot's boyfriend had cried out, ''Let's get her,'' after a practice session.</p>
        <p>On Thursday Amelie Cocheteux, who allegedly used a racial slur in Alexandra's direction, said, ''All of this is purely invented.'' Today Sidot had a chance to defend herself.</p>
        <p>After losing her third-round match to Tamarine Tanasugarn, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, Sidot acknowledged yanking down Samantha Stevenson's hat, but said it was only in response to an insult Alexandra's mother had directed at her. As for the threat allegedly issued by her boyfriend, Sidot said: ''It's a lie. Never, never, never, never. She said so many wrong things, so I'm not surprised that she said another thing.''</p>
        <p>It was also not shocking to see a release issued jointly by the World Tennis Association and the All England Club regarding the rowdy and hostile behavior Damir Dokic displayed on Thursday. The father of Jelena Dokic boisterously stormed around the grounds and smashed a reporter's cell phone. ''We will be monitoring the conduct of Mr. Dokic closely,'' officials said in the release. ''Should this again fall below acceptable standards, it would lead to Mr. Dokic being banned from the grounds.''</p>
        <p>In the middle of her own circus, there was irritation clearly registered on Sidot's face. She could not understand why accusations were being aimed at her, but Sidot did have her own opinions about Alexandra Stevenson's mother.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I never had problems with players or with coaches,'' Sidot said. ''So, I don't understand. Maybe she doesn't feel good in this world, I don't know. She said that if she knew before it was going to be like this, she would have sent Alexandra to school. I mean, it's more her who has a problem than us. She said something bad about me, but it's not true.''</p>
        <p>Agassi Loses His Cool</p>
        <p>Just before Referee Alan Mills postponed the Andre Agassi-Todd Martin match on Center Court Thursday night because of rain, Agassi expressed his concerns about the increasingly slippery grass. Still, play continued until Agassi took a bad fall. Mills stepped out and suspended play, but Agassi was furious and shouted his opinion.</p>
        <p>''I phoned him up this morning and told him that I apologized for certainly raising my tone,'' Agassi said.</p>
        <p>A week before Wimbledon, in a similar circumstance, Agassi slipped and tweaked his back in a match at Queen's Club. On Thursday he was not hurt by his fall.</p>
        <p>''I was just laying there trying to stall, hoping it would rain more,'' Agassi said with a smile. ''I went over and toweled off, just worked it like a veteran.''</p>
        <p>Sampras's Status in Doubt</p>
        <p>The Davis Cup is just over three weeks away and Pete Sampras's injury (tendinitis) has put the American team's makeup in question. But another issue was also posed today: should the Davis Cup captain John McEnroe play doubles?</p>
        <p>''As exciting as that would be for the public, and the press,'' said Todd Martin, ''it also takes away from the productivity that I think John can have on the rest of the team. I think that would hurt us more than help us.''</p>
