        <p>A man convicted of ordering the killings of an 8-year-old murder witness and his mother was sentenced today to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p>
        <p>A jury failed to agree last week on  whether the man, Russell Peeler Jr., deserved the death penalty, leaving the judge no choice but to impose a  life sentence.</p>
        <p>The judge, G. Sarsfield Ford of State Superior Court here, said today that the prosecutors had not met their burden of convincing the jury that aggravating factors in the case warranted the death penalty. On June 8, the jury convicted Mr. Peeler of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of capital felony.</p>
        <p>The January 1999 killing of the witness, Leroy Brown Jr., and his mother, Karen Clarke, outraged the public and prompted a swift strengthening of Connecticut's witness protection laws. Prosecutors said Mr. Peeler had directed his brother, Adrian, to carry out the killings to prevent the boy from testifying against him in another murder case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peeler, 28, was convicted in that case for the fatal shooting of Ms. Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr., even without the boy's testimony. Prosecutors argued that the life sentence imposed today added nothing to Mr. Peeler's punishment because he was already serving life sentences for the earlier murder and for his conviction in a federal drug case.</p>
        <p>Adrian Peeler is awaiting a separate trial on murder charges. In court today, Russell Peeler Jr. maintained his innocence, The Associated Press reported. ''I feel for the family, but we didn't have anything to do with it,'' The A.P. quoted him as saying. ''I am not an animal.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to the court, Ms. Clarke's brother, Oswald, told Mr. Peeler that he would suffer in prison. ''You will wish you had received the death penalty,'' Mr. Clarke wrote.</p>
