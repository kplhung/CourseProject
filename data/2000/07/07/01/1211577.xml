        <p>Early results of a referendum on Uganda's political future showed today that more than 80 percent of those voting want to continue with the current ''no party'' system advocated by the nation's president.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the president, Yoweri Museveni, declared victory, saying the turnout was far too low for him to claim a strong mandate. His opponents had called for a boycott of a referendum on whether to continue the so-called Movement system or return to a multiparty system.</p>
        <p>Based on returns counted by this evening, just 40.5 percent of registered voters took part, far less than the roughly 75 percent in the 1996 presidential election.</p>
        <p>''Ugandans have spoken about the Movement system of government,'' said Cecilia Atim-Ogwal, the leader of one faction of the opposition Ugandan People's Congress. ''They have rejected it totally.''</p>
        <p>But an official of the Movement said people had not stayed away because of the boycott, but rather because of rain and because Mr. Museveni's victory had not seemed in doubt.</p>
        <p>''So far, so good,'' the official, Moses Byaruhanga, secretary of the Movement National Referendum Committee, said this afternoon after the first results were tallied. ''This has showed what the people want.''</p>
        <p>At a minimum the results and the low turnout seemed to give both sides something to campaign on next year, when elections for the presidency and Parliament will be held.</p>
        <p>In this campaign Mr. Museveni, a former bush fighter who took power in 1986, argued that political parties merely divided Uganda by tribe and religion. Those divisions, he says, gave rise to two dictators, Idi Amin and Milton Obote, and a distinctly violent era of Uganda's history since the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>But supporters of the multiparty system say the Movement -- which allows political parties in name only -- violates their freedom of association guaranteed by the Constitution. Moreover, they argue, the Movement is essentially a one-party system, which they say Mr. Museveni manipulates to his political advantage.</p>
        <p>Foreign diplomats and other experts give Mr. Museveni credit for bringing a measure of peace and economic growth to Uganda, though some Western governments have also been pushing him behind the scenes to open up politically.</p>
        <p>He has argued that the system is open because he appoints his opponents -- like Paul Ssemogerere, who ran for president against Mr. Museveni but later served as his foreign minister -- to top positions.</p>
        <p>The results released today accounted for roughly 10 percent of Uganda's 9.6 million registered voters. The Movement won 83 percent of the votes cast, and the multiparty advocates 17 percent.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Thursday with a United Nations news service, Mr. Museveni said any result under 60 percent would show ''a serious problem with the Movement system.''</p>
        <p>The results varied by region, with sections of the north, where Mr. Museveni is unpopular because of a rebellion and remaining support for Mr. Obote, barely turning out.</p>
        <p>Only 11 percent of voters went to the polls, for example, in the northern town of Kitgum. Mrs. AtimOgwal, a member of Parliament, said less than 10 percent of people in her northern town, Lira, had voted.</p>
        <p>Much of the votes from the west, Mr. Museveni's home region, had not been counted by this evening. The remaining results are expected by Saturday.</p>
