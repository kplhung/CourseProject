        <p>After citing ''serious concerns'' about flaws in an initiative by New York City to move one million poor residents on Medicaid into managed care health plans, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall approved a two-year extension of the program yesterday, along with a list of recommendations on how to improve the effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall spent several months reviewing the request by the State Department of Health for the $40 million extension and expansion of a collaborative state and city program, raising a series of questions about Maximus, the Virginia-based contractor hired to help enroll the poor in their new insurance plans. The original $24 million contract expired yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I continue to have serious concerns regarding the performance and integrity of Maximus and your agency's oversight and monitoring,'' Mr. McCall wrote in a letter yesterday to Antonia C. Novello, the state commissioner of health. ''This is not simply an issue of contract compliance. The health and well-being of Medicaid recipients is dependent upon the quality of these outreach services.''</p>
        <p>By intention, the switch to managed care should cut government cost and enhance health care, because Medicaid recipients would have their own family doctors instead of relying, as many now do, on emergency rooms for basic care. But the process of linking people with managed-care doctors has proved complicated in New York and other states, in part because so many Medicaid recipients do not speak English.</p>
        <p>The mandatory switch to managed care is happening in phases across New York City, with the effort so far limited to Staten Island, Lower Manhattan and southwest Brooklyn. Medicaid recipients are given 60 days to pick a health plan and doctor, after which both are assigned. Maximus sets up neighborhood seminars and operates a telephone center to answer questions about the plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall urged the state and Maximus to improve the training and monitoring of the call center staff, citing frequently inaccurate information. The state-maintained list of health plan doctors also needs to be revised, he said, to remove errors that at times result in patients being assigned to doctors who do not speak their language or are not part of the managed-care network. And the state needs to simplify the process of granting mandatory enrollment waivers to people who have special conditions or cannot find a doctor who speaks their language, he said.</p>
        <p>John F. Signor, a spokesman for the State Department of Health, said the department was pleased that the comptroller had approved the two-year extension and the expansion of Maximus's services into Nassau and Suffolk Counties. But he added that the criticisms Mr. McCall raised were in large part problems that had already been remedied or were in the process of being so.</p>
        <p>''We will continue to monitor and oversee Maximus to ensure Medicaid recipients receive quality health care and it is done in a culturally sensitive and language-friendly manner,'' Mr. Signor said.</p>
        <p>Rachael A. Rowland, a Maximus spokeswoman, said that the company was prepared for the audit Mr. McCall said he intended to do to determine whether his recommendations were being followed.</p>
        <p>''We welcome the opportunity for his office or others to examine our operations and see how successful and effective they are,'' Ms. Rowland said.</p>
