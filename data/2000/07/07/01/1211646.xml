        <p>At the game's pivotal moment, all eyes turned to the left-field corner, just as everyone expected.</p>
        <p>But the drama in last night's Mets-Braves game had nothing to do with John Rocker, who was requested three times by the crowd of 52,831 at Shea Stadium during the eighth inning, but never dashed in from the left-field bullpen.</p>
        <p>The highlight of this game was better than an appearance by Rocker, and any of the jeering and sneering that would accompany one. This was what the Mets and Braves were talking about when they said they would play great baseball this weekend.</p>
        <p>On the first pitch he saw from Terry Mulholland in the eighth inning, Mike Piazza lined a three-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole to cap an inning that matched the most prolific in Mets history. It broke a tie, gave the Mets 10 runs in the inning and lifted them to an 11-8 victory in a game that had been dominated by the Mets' sloppy play.</p>
        <p>''It's a big game for us,'' Piazza said. ''It's a great win for us. Fortunately for us, we snuck up on them. Hopefully, this is the type of win that gets you into the playoffs. Hopefully, this will relax us a little bit.''</p>
        <p>The Mets (45-32) pulled to within two games of first place in the National League East, and can tie the Braves (48-31) for first by winning the final two games of this series.</p>
        <p>''These are intense games, with all the added issues surrounding it,'' first baseman Todd Zeile said. ''You can feel beat up on after you've made a couple of mistakes, and you can get flat. But one positive is, we didn't do that.''</p>
        <p>Piazza's home run was not the kind he usually hits. This was no scorcher to the opposite field or high-arching parabola into the left-field bleachers.</p>
        <p>When it crashed against the padding a few feet over the fence, the fans exhaled and screamed and arms shot up all over Shea.</p>
        <p>''Mike gets in certain situations where you can feel that the pitcher is in trouble,'' Zeile said.</p>
        <p>Kevin Millwood never seemed in trouble as the Braves built an 8-1 lead through seven and a half innings. Millwood had handcuffed the Mets for seven innings and muted the crowd, but the presence of the journeyman Don Wengert created an opening for the Mets in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Derek Bell opened the inning with a single. Piazza singled with one out and an error advanced the runners, and Robin Ventura's groundout brought in Bell to make the score 8-2.</p>
        <p>Zeile singled, and Jay Payton did the same. As they had done when Wengert entered, the fans chanted for Rocker, who had a callus on his thumb and could not pitch. Braves Manager Bobby Cox called for Kerry Ligtenberg, who saved the first game of this series on Thursday night, but he was a disaster.</p>
        <p>Benny Agbayani walked to load the bases. A walk to Mark Johnson brought in a run. A walk to Melvin Mora brought in another. Cox had seen enough, and Mulholland entered. The control specialist walked Bell, forcing in another. Somewhere in Texas, the former Mets pitcher Kenny Rogers, who walked in the run that clinched the pennant for Atlanta last October, must have noticed.</p>
        <p>By then the Braves led, 8-6, and Edgardo Alfonzo came to bat. The Mets' second baseman lashed a two-run single to left, tying the game and setting up Piazza's 22nd home run of the season. The blast also gave Piazza 13 consecutive games with a run batted in, establishing a National League record.</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez (2-3) pitched the ninth inning and was credited with a victory by the official scorer, who ruled that the rookie Eric Cammack -- who had been the last pitcher before the game-turning outburst, did not deserve the decision.</p>
        <p>Until the eighth, the Braves were asserting their dominance over the team they had beaten in 19 of their last 25 regular-season meetings, and in the National League Championship Series last October.</p>
        <p>''People ask us why we can't beat the Braves,'' Piazza said. ''It's obvious -- they've been playing better than us. They put pressure on us, they take the extra base, they pitch well.''</p>
        <p>The Braves had two singles in the first inning, but a passed ball, hit batsman and bases-loaded walk helped them to their first run. In the third, a bases-loaded single led to three Braves runs. In the seventh, Mora threw away an inning-ending double-play ball, and the Braves scored again.</p>
        <p>The Mets could hardly have been in a better position than they were when this series began. They had won seven games in a row, and their best position players were well-rested. Seven hitters in their lineup were batting .300. And, the thinking went, the Braves might be distracted by the hoopla over Rocker's return to the city he ridiculed in a Sports Illustrated article last winter.</p>
        <p>But these are the Mets and Braves, and that simple matchup seems to trump every other factor. The Mets, of course, won twice last October after falling behind by 3-0 in the series. But normalcy seemed to be back early in the game.</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton had shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates in his last start and has been rolling for almost two months. But he allowed five runs last night, and he walked six (one intentionally) over seven innings.</p>
        <p>The first walk capped a messy inning and established a pattern for much of the game. The Braves put runners on first and second with one out by swinging early in the count. Then a passed ball by Piazza advanced the runners, and Hampton drilled Andres Galarraga on the next pitch, loading the bases.</p>
        <p>Javy Lopez walked on a high fastball, but Hampton escaped further damage when Bobby Bonilla grounded into a double play.</p>
        <p>Holding their 1-0 lead in the third, the Braves loaded the bases with one out on a bad-hop single, another single and a walk. Then Lopez came up and grounded one to the left side of the infield.</p>
        <p>A few feet in either direction, and it could have been an inning-ending double play. But this hit made it through, one run scored easily, and Agbayani's throw got away from Piazza as a second run came in.</p>
        <p>This was trouble. The ball scooted down the dirt path leading from the third-base on-deck circle to the plate. Piazza slid after it, groping three times for the ball with his bare hand as he watched the lumbering Galarraga bear down on home plate. By the time Piazza found the ball, Galarraga had scored the third run. Piazza was charged with an error.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>GRANT ROBERTS, who is being considered as a possible replacement for the injured starter RICK REED, lasted only three and two-thirds innings for Class AAA Norfolk last night, allowing three runs on six hits and three walks.</p>
