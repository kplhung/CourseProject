        <p>In a culture of silence, words can be weapons. In perhaps no contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening than in Saudi Arabia, where sins, sources of shame and sometimes even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.</p>
        <p>So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago that Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi media baron and former co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his country, even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into battle to free Kuwait.</p>
        <p>In September 1990, the prince quietly agreed to finance an ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later, the Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a 12-volume, Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life, has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series, which includes 5,000 drawings, illustrations and graphs, is the largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia. It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and archaeological sites, traditional medicine, geography, even children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the camel.</p>
        <p>While Prince Khaled said he had contemplated such a project for two years before the gulf war, the conflict was the project's main catalyst. ''The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its cultural heritage, not just among foreigners but among younger Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our traditions before it was too late,'' he said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Thanks to oil wealth, lifestyles have changed faster and more dramatically in Saudi Arabia than in almost any other country. Fifty-year-old Saudis can recall baked-mud hovels, with neither electricity nor running water, in which most of them were raised, but young Saudis today can barely imagine life without the Internet, cellular telephones, vacations abroad, air-conditioned suburban homes, sport utility vehicles and fancy shopping malls. Few have ever even ridden a camel.</p>
        <p>Yet Saudi contributors to the volumes say that a work of this nature could probably not have been undertaken as long as tribal and regional divisions continued to plague the kingdom. Oil wealth has helped unify Saudis politically and culturally, said Sa'ad al-Sowayan, an anthropologist with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley and the encyclopedia's chief editor. Until Saudis spoke the same Arabic dialect and tribal and regional cultural differences diminished, a project examining the country's heritage would have been too contentious to be approved by the censors.</p>
        <p>In addition, he observed, until recently many Saudi scholars viewed folk culture as academically dubious. They believed that attention to traditional ways of life emphasized backwardness. But after the gulf war, Mr. Sowayan said, ''people realized that our old civilization was dying out, and that we had a limited window to capture what was being lost, mostly through memory. It gave us a renewed sense of urgency.''</p>
        <p>Some 75 leading Saudi scholars and writers contributed to the encyclopedia. Their texts were then vetted by older, often uneducated Saudis who still remembered many of the nearly extinct customs.</p>
        <p>Consider the 547-page volume on the camel. The volume notes that it was the domestication of this amazingly adaptive, aggressive, often crotchety creature that made Bedouin nomadic life possible. Saudis rarely tired of extolling the camel's endurance, forbearance, fortitude and other virtues in chants, conversation, lore and song.</p>
        <p>Bedouin poetry likens the swishing of the camel's tail to the swaying of the unbraided plaits of a beautiful young woman dancing on her wedding night. Without the camel, Mr. Sowayan said, nearly a third of the Arabic language would disappear.</p>
        <p>Legend has it that the Arabs stole camels from the Jews. Because in Saudi lore the Jews are said to be still longing for their animals, the Bedouins describe any false hope by likening it to the hope of the Jews for the camels' return.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the volume asserts, the camel was superseded as the major symbol of Arabia by the palm tree, the emblem of the sedentary farmers, merchants and traders who were the Muslim prophet Muhammad's first and most enduring followers.</p>
        <p>This community, which loathed and feared the warring Bedouins, imposed its written, settled culture on nomadic culture, said Abdulaziz Fahad, a lawyer and an early champion of the project. As a result, Saudi society remains deeply ambivalent about the desert and the traditional Bedouin life.</p>
        <p>Some of that traditional culture has already vanished beyond memory and retrieval. The encyclopedia, for instance, includes no volumes on folk songs or traditional dancing because Mr. Sowayan could not find qualified authorities to write them.  Nor is there a volume on Islam or any of Arabia's pre-Islamic religions. Religion is not folk culture, he asserted.</p>
        <p>Still, the volumes may stir controversy among some of the kingdom's more rigid, literal-minded clerics.</p>
        <p>As one contributor said, conservatives won't like the discussions of ''un-Islamic'' traditions and beliefs, or the books' many representational photographs and drawings, which they say are prohibited by Islam.</p>
        <p>But so far, the encyclopedia has had no problem winning official blessing.</p>
        <p>Because the Saudi government decided some two decades ago that any genuine encyclopedia would not be censored, the Ministry of Information, which routinely blacks out with felt-tipped pens magazine photographs considered too licentious, approved the encyclopedia with its pictures and drawings in less than 10 days.</p>
        <p>''This work will not only help us preserve our vanishing past, but by examining the past, will emphasize our new cultural and political unity,'' Mr. Sowayan said. ''In that sense, it is a truly nationalist project.''</p>
