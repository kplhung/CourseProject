        <p>The free-agent period begins in the National Hockey League today with Eric Lindros still the limited property of the Philadelphia Flyers and Mark Messier probably free to make his own deal with any team.</p>
        <p>Both big centers may be interested in playing for the Rangers. But the Flyers' difficult decision to submit a contract proposal to Lindros last night makes Lindros a restricted free agent, with only conditional mobility. The Vancouver Canucks were not expected to pick up Messier's contract option by the midnight deadline last night.</p>
        <p>The Lindros decision came after a day of debate within the Flyers' hierarchy. Lindros suffered four concussions last season and criticized the team's medical care. He was stripped of his captaincy and relations had deteriorated between the Flyers and the Lindros family. Lindros is represented by his father, Carl Lindros. Eric Lindros still suffers from post-concussion symptoms and it is not certain he will ever play again.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday General Manager Bob Clarke of the Flyers was unsure whether the Flyers would submit a qualifying offer of $8.5 million for next season, equal to Lindros's pay last season. Had the Flyers not made the offer, Lindros would have been unrestricted and free to sign with any team.</p>
        <p>''Everything's a gamble,'' Clarke said. ''If someone wants him, it's a gamble on their part. If we want to keep him, it's a gamble on our part.''</p>
        <p>Lindros still can sign with any team, but the Flyers have the right to match any contract offer and keep him. Should Lindros sign with another team, with the Flyers declining to match, they would get five first-round draft choices as compensation. Or, the two teams could work out a trade.</p>
        <p>Late last night, after extending the contract offer to Lindros, Clarke said: ''Eric Lindros is one of the top players in the game and is an integral part of our organization. We're hopeful that he will enjoy a complete recovery and return to play hockey at the high level to which we have become accustomed.</p>
        <p>''On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the relationship between myself and Eric and his family has deteriorated. I intend to do whatever I can to try to move this relationship onto a better course.''</p>
        <p>If Lindros signs his offer from Philadelphia, it appears as if the Flyers are obligated to pay him, even if he cannot play because of injuries. Can the Flyers avoid paying Lindros if he does not pass the physical examination before the season and is unable to play? Not according to the N.H.L. Players' Association spokesman, Tim Wharnsby.</p>
        <p>''If he signs it, he'll still get his money because the Flyers knew he was injured,'' Wharnsby said.</p>
        <p>When healthy, Lindros is one of the best players in the N.H.L. He won the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in 1995. But neither Lindros nor Messier is considered the powerful and intimidating force he was five years ago. When asked about his son's health, Carl Lindros said this week: ''He's progressing. He still has symptoms.'' But he declined to be specific.</p>
        <p>The Messier situation is less complicated. After three seasons with the Canucks, Messier is 39 years old. A popular captain who left the Rangers as a free agent in 1997 after six seasons, Messier could have stayed in Vancouver another season if the Canucks picked up a $6 million option on his contract.</p>
        <p>Should the Canucks decline, they would owe him a $2 million buyout and Messier would become an unrestricted free agent. Brian Burke, general manager of the Canucks, said this week, ''At this point in time, it is unlikely we will exercise our option.'' In 66 games, Messier scored 17 goals, with 37 assists.</p>
        <p>Doug Messier, Mark's father and agent, said yesterday that the Canucks had not extended his son's contract and that an extension was not expected. From 1984 through 1990, Messier played on five Stanley Cup champions for the Edmonton Oilers. He added another ring with the Rangers in 1994.</p>
        <p>Glen Sather, the general manager and coach of those Oilers teams, is the new general manager of the Rangers. There is much speculation around the N.H.L. that Messier will sign with Sather's Rangers, perhaps for a lower salary, to finish his career in New York.</p>
        <p>And there are hints of more movement along the Oilers-Rangers pipeline. A report in The Hartford Courant on Wednesday said the Rangers would name Ron Low as coach. But John Rosasco, a Rangers spokesman, said Sather would not name a coach until at least July 8. Low is a former coach of the Oilers.</p>
        <p>Sather last week got permission from the Flyers to talk to Lindros, and inquired about his health. Also getting permission were the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Dallas Stars and Carolina Hurricanes are also thought to be interested. Long an admirer of Messier's, the 27-year-old Lindros has said in the past that he would like to be Messier's teammate.</p>
        <p>Both men are represented by their fathers. When Messier left the Rangers in 1997, there was a rift between his father and some members of the Madison Square Garden management. But Doug Messier said today that it would not be an obstacle to his son returning.</p>
        <p>''The future's what everything's about,'' Doug Messier said, adding that his son holds no grudges.</p>
