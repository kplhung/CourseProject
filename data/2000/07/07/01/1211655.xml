      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a close vote, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (USA) approved an amendment to the church's constitution tonight forbidding ministers from conducting same-sex unions.</p>
        <p>The decision, which will take effect next June if it is ratified by two-thirds of the church's regional jurisdictions, came after an emotional debate on an issue that has been quite contentious among other Protestant denominations.</p>
        <p>Within the last year, for example, two ministers within the larger United Methodist Church have been brought to trial for violating a law of their denomination forbidding same-sex unions. Both were convicted and one was defrocked, while the other was suspended from his duties.</p>
        <p>The Presbyterian amendment's approval came on a 268-to-251 vote, among the final items of business at the denomination's General Assembly, which has been meeting in this southern California port city since last Saturday.</p>
        <p>In the debate, supporters of the amendment described it as upholding a traditional Christian view of marriage. One church elder, Paula Metherell, a member of the local presbytery here in Long Beach, said ''the duty of the church'' is to serve as ''a moral beacon,'' calling people to a life of holiness.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the measure, like George McCall of Missouri, argued that the amendment, if approved, would limit the ability of pastors to minister effectively to all members of their congregation. ''Do not bind our conscience and tie our hands as pastors,'' Mr. McCall said.</p>
        <p>Prior to the vote, the assembly narrowly defeated an alternative proposal that would have called for a ''spirit of dialogue'' to prevail among Presbyterians and for the church to honor ''the discretion of pastors'' in providing care to their congregations.</p>
        <p>The denomination, with 2.6 million members in 11,400 congregations spread coast to coast, represents one of the most historically influential streams of Protestantism in the United States. Presbyterians have been heavily represented in American politics, most prominently counting Woodrow Wilson, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan among their ranks.</p>
        <p>The denomination's governing structure has significant parallels to that of the United States, with the Presbyterian assembly playing a role similar to that of Congress in passing constitutional amendments, which then must be ratified by the presbyteries, the regional jurisdictions, that play a role in that process similar to the states.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, the denomination has become increasingly riled by issues centering on what rights are due its gay members. And division over same-sex unions was evident earlier this week, among the commissioners, as Presbyterian delegates are called, on the committee that formulated the amendment.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, by a vote of 25 to 22, the committee approved a statement declaring, ''Scripture and our confessions teach that God's intention for all people is to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.'' The amendment adds that church officers may not bless same-sex unions, nor may church property be used for such a purpose.</p>
        <p>The amendment's wording is close to the law against same-sex unions adopted by the Methodists in 1996.</p>
        <p>But tonight's vote is not the first time Presbyterian leaders have attempted to legislate against same-sex unions. Six years ago, the assembly adopted a similar amendment, but it failed to win the approval of the needed majority of the presbyteries to become law. In 1995, a similar effort failed to pass the assembly.</p>
        <p>But since then, the denomination has seemed to lean in a more conservative direction on issues relating to homosexuals. In 1996, the assembly approved an amendment barring the ordination of anyone sexually active outside the bounds of marriage, a move widely understood as aimed at preventing noncelibate gays and lesbians from serving as ministers, elders or deacons. It became church law the next year, after more than two-thirds of the presbyteries voted in its favor.</p>
        <p>One of the organizations that supported that amendment was the Presbyterian Coalition. Its moderator, or top official, the Rev. Jerry Anderson of Glen Ellyn, Ill., said after tonight's vote that there was ''no room to gloat'' for the amendment's supporters, because many Presbyterians who opposed the amendment were suffering ''a lot of pain.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson said he expected the amendment to be ratified overwhelmingly.</p>
        <p>But one of the amendment's opponents, Mitzi Henderson, a Californian who serves as co-moderator of the More Light Presbyterian Churches, an organization that supports gay rights, said, ''I don't think it's the end of the struggle.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Henderson said she did not agree that the amendment would be easily ratified by the presbyteries.</p>
        <p>Controversial questions among religious organizations of how to relate to gays and lesbians in their pews reflect similar tensions within American society and politics. The vote here, for example, came the same week as the United States Supreme Court narrowly upheld the right of the Boy Scouts of America to bar a gay man from serving as a scout leader. And the Presbyterians' vote also follows the decision of the Vermont legislature earlier this year to extend to same-sex unions a civil recognition that stops just short of calling them marriage.</p>
        <p>Major religious organizations have taken different positions as they have wrestled with such questions as whether they should ordain gays or permit same-sex unions. For example, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, representing the leaders of more than 800 Reform synagogues, voted in March to support members who officiate at same-sex unions. Two months later, the Methodists' policy-making body affirmed its law forbidding ministers from performing such unions.</p>
        <p>An even tougher approach has been taken by the conservative Southern Baptist Convention, with 15.8 million members, which amended its basic statement of faith in June to call on Christians to oppose homosexuality, along with abortion, pornography and racism. Eight years ago, the Southern Baptists amended their constitution to allow the denomination to sever ties with any congregation that ordained gays or allowed same-sex unions.</p>
