        <p>Supporters of a manned mission to Mars have been out in force since NASA's announcement last week that there are recent, perhaps even current, sources of liquid water on the planet. They argue that water will enable human colonies to thrive. But it would be foolhardy to bend the findings to justify a manned mission.</p>
        <p>The quest for life has become the focus of NASA's Mars program, and without question, the discovery of persuasive evidence for it (there is none yet) would have profound implications for our perception of our place in the universe. If life is not even unique to Earth within our solar system, it may be common in the cosmos at large.</p>
        <p>Finding life (or the fossilized signs of it) means ''following the water,'' for without liquid water, life cannot exist. By this reasoning, we should perhaps be looking instead to Jupiter's moon Europa, which seems to have a global ocean of salty water beneath its icy crust. But Mars is nearer and in many respects more Earth-like. Besides, it has sentimental attractions, dating from the astronomer Percival Lowell's claims in the 1890's to have seen canals built by a dying civilization to the later fantasies of H. G. Wells and Edgar Rice Burroughs.</p>
        <p>The evidence that water once flowed on Mars is all but incontrovertible. The planet is covered with sinuous channels that cannot easily be interpreted as anything other than dried-up river valleys. These features are at least a billion years old, but the new findings reveal that at least some of this water went underground. The gullies now seen by the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor appear to be ''young'' in geological terms, which means they might be anywhere from a million years to a week old.</p>
        <p>The discovery, another triumph for the Global Surveyor, demonstrates just how effective unmanned missions can be. And at $165 million it is something of a bargain. But NASA knows too well that cheap missions can be false economies. In September last year the Mars Climate Orbiter was lost, followed in December by the Mars Polar Lander, the victim of human calculation errors.</p>
        <p>These experiences have forced NASA to rethink its strategy. It was trying to do too much with too little: to answer a barrage of scientific questions with budget spacecraft that, in the end, cut too many corners.</p>
        <p>Yet the impulse to use unmanned craft was the right one. Simple, focused missions can pay rich dividends, as the 1997 Pathfinder mission demonstrated by successfully landing on Mars and returning new images of the planet's environment. There is much more science to be reaped from unmanned orbiter and lander missions than from the hubristic endeavor, at many times the cost, to put people on Martian soil.</p>
        <p>NASA would do well to resist the temptation to act upon the invitation inherent in the words of Dr. Michael Malin, who heads the Global Surveyor imaging team. ''One of the most interesting and significant aspects of this discovery is what it could mean if human explorers ever go to Mars,'' he said, explaining how useful water would be for drinking or splitting into hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel.</p>
        <p>While ''cathedral science'' -- huge projects that are more inspirational than useful -- has its place, we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the supposed glamour of manned space flight. The unmanned Mars missions are themselves ''cathedrals'' of which NASA can be proud, and they needed no passengers to make that so.</p>
