        <p>AT&amp;T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone operation, the largest in the nation, as a separately traded tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.</p>
        <p>No such plan has yet been presented to the AT&amp;T board by its management, these people said. AT&amp;T declined to comment.</p>
        <p>One reason AT&amp;T may want to issue a new stock to track the long-distance unit is that its shares have languished recently. AT&amp;T hit a new 52-week low during trading yesterday and closed at $31.8125, down 31 cents.</p>
        <p>Management is eager to bolster the stock price and believes that issuing a new stock could accomplish that.</p>
        <p>If the shrinking consumer long-distance unit were made separate, the remainder of the company would show faster growth. Those remaining units would include the operation that sells communication services, as well as data services, to business customers, and AT&amp;T's cable television operation, the largest in the nation.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance operation generates about $20 billion a year in revenue, but is shrinking. In the first quarter, that unit reported $5.1 billion in revenue, down 5.6 percent from the 1999 period. The consumer long-distance business is shrinking because many other companies compete with AT&amp;T in the long-distance business and prices have come down quickly.</p>
        <p>In recent years, many companies have offered new shares that are meant to track the performance of specific units. Tracking stocks do not, however, represent any actual economic interest in the unit that they represent.</p>
        <p>In April, AT&amp;T offered new shares meant to track the performance of its fast-growing wireless business. Those shares, in AT&amp;T Wireless Group, were offered at $29.50 on April 27 and closed yesterday at $33.</p>
        <p>Companies generally offer tracking stocks for their units that are growing quickly. Because AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance unit is shrinking, however, it is unclear just what investors would be willing to pay for such a stock. While it is shrinking, AT&amp;T's consumer long-distance unit does generate a lot of cash. In the first quarter, that unit generated $2 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, up 4 percent from the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Millions of people own AT&amp;T's stock, making it one of the most widely held in the nation. For decades, AT&amp;T had a monopoly in the long-distance telephone industry, until that monopoly began to crumble under assault from the government and competitors like MCI in the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>Since the old American Telephone and Telegraph Company was broken up in 1984, the remaining long-distance company has lost market share in long-distance every year. It has been very hard for AT&amp;T to compete against smaller companies that have lower costs, according to industry experts.</p>
