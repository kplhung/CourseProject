        <p>Three players with little success on the L.P.G.A. tour had the most success yesterday in the opening round of the richest 54-hole tournament on the tour.</p>
        <p>Michelle Estill, Jackie Gallagher-Smith and Janice Moodie each shot a five-under-par 66 and shared the lead at the $1.1 million ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic on the 6,051-yard Bay Course at the Seaview Marriott Resort in Absecon, N.J.</p>
        <p>Combined, the three players have only two victories in 20 years on the circuit. All three played in the morning under ideal conditions on a course where scores were higher with afternoon winds.</p>
        <p>Estill's 66 was only her second score in the 60's in 42 rounds this season. She is 120th on the money list and her best finish is 26th. She has one victory in 10 years, in her rookie season in 1991. Estill, who has missed the cut seven times this year, had seven birdies and two bogeys.</p>
        <p>''I played so good in the pro-am the other day that I had a glass of wine that night to make sure that I was still alive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Gallagher-Smith's 66 came on six birdies and a bogey. She is 101st on the money list and has missed the cut eight times this year. Her only victory in seven years on tour came last season, when she shot a 65 on the final day to capture the Giant Eagle L.P.G.A. Classic.</p>
        <p>Moodie, in her third season on tour, has three finishes in the top 10 this year. She birdied six holes, including the last three.</p>
        <p>There were three players at 67 and six at 68. Se Ri Pak, last year's winner, who shot a tournament record 63 on the opening day, was at one-under 70. Juli Inkster, last week's winner at McDonald's L.P.G.A. Championship and the winner of this tournament in 1986 and 1988, also shot a 70, with birdies on the last three holes.</p>

        <p>THORPE TRAILS FLEISHER BY A SHOT: Jim Thorpe, who has finished higher than sixth just once in 19 Senior PGA Tour events this year, moved into position yesterday for his first victory on any tour in 14 years.</p>
        <p>Thorpe shot a six-under-par 65 and pulled within a shot of Bruce Fleisher at 134 after two rounds in the United States Senior Open.</p>
        <p>Thorpe, 51, birdied the last three holes for a 30 on the back nine at Saucon Valley Country Club in Bethlehem, Pa. He matched the record for the lowest nine-hole score previously posted by five players, most recently by Ed Dougherty on the back nine of the first round last year.</p>
        <p>Tom Kite also shot a 65 yesterday as he and Thorpe tied the record for the lowest second-round score in a Senior Open, matching Gary Player in 1990.</p>
        <p>Fleisher shot a 69, and Hubert Green had a 70 to fall two strokes behind at 135. Hale Irwin shot a par-71 and was tied with Kite for fourth at 137.</p>
        <p>Jack Nicklaus followed a solid 67 in the first round with a 75. Arnold Palmer, a native of Latrobe, Pa., failed to make the cut for the second straight year after shooting rounds of 76 and 82. (AP)</p>
        <p>CALCAVECCHIA SHOOTS A 64: Mark Calcavecchia shot a six-under-par 64 yesterday to keep pace with Notah Begay after the second round of the Greater Hartford Open.</p>
        <p>Calcavecchia, a nine-time winner on tour, matched Begay at 11-under-par 129 on the T.P.C. at River Highlands in Cromwell, Conn. Begay, coming off a victory last week in Memphis, shot a 65 that included a double-bogey on No. 17.</p>
        <p>Edward Fryatt was two strokes back after a 64, and Dave Stockton Jr. was three back along with Hal Sutton and Jim Furyk. Charles Howell, the National Collegiate Athletic Association champion, made the cut in his first professional tournament, shooting a 67 for a two-under-par 138. Among those missing the cut were Davis Love III, Fuzzy Zoeller, John Daly and Casey Martin. (AP)</p>
