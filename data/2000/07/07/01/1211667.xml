        <p>American crews competing at the 151st Henley Royal Regatta continued their winning ways yesterday at Henley-on-Thames, England.</p>
        <p>The Yale and Columbia varsity lightweights dispatched their opposition in heats of the Temple Challenge Cup, setting up a final meeting of the season today. Winning margins of less than a second separated the two crews as they traded championships in the United States, and today they will race in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>In the other half of the draw, Brown's junior varsity heavyweights continue undefeated in 2000. The Rutgers lightweight varsity was the only American team to lose a Temple Cup race, to England's Oxford Brookes University.</p>
        <p>Brown's men's varsity heavyweights scored the most impressive victory of yesterday's semifinals, in the Ladies' Challenge Plate, winning in 6 minutes 18 seconds. The Bruins will next face California, which defeated them a month ago for the United States collegiate title. Cal (6:22) advanced yesterday but struggled to a 6-foot decision over South Africa's Trident Rowing Club.</p>
        <p>Today the first women's eights races in Henley's 161-year history will get under way with an all-American heat between the universities of Washington and Virginia.</p>
