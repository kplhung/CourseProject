        <p>The Mexican election has come north of the border.</p>
        <p>Mexican presidential candidates have campaigned in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, even though Mexicans cannot vote from abroad. The politicians are urging Mexicans from New York to San Francisco to call their family and friends back home, advising them how to vote on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Political parties have organized caravans of buses and cars -- even evoking history by going on horseback -- to take registered voters to polling places set up in border towns in Mexico.</p>
        <p>And in what experts call an extraordinary step toward linking Mexicans north and south of the Rio Grande, three Mexicans living in the United States are running for seats in Mexico's Congress. If they win -- and chances are good for at least two of them, in Chicago and Los Angeles -- they will live in the United States and represent Mexicans here.</p>
        <p>The extension of the hotly contested campaign in Mexico to the barrios of the United States is a sign of how important the 10 million Mexicans living here have become to Mexico. In a presidential race in which the governing party is considered vulnerable for the first time in 71 years, expatriates have been courted and lobbied like never before.</p>
        <p>''My whole family is there, and I tell them the importance of voting,'' said Rosario Rabiela, who owns Decima Musa, a restaurant in Chicago's heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood. ''We are here, but we contribute so much in Mexico.''</p>
        <p>Emigrants ''are going to be a big factor in this election,'' said Robert Smith, a sociologist at Barnard College who studies Mexican migration to the United States. ''They will call their people back home and tell them vote for so-and-so. They are also big leaders of public opinion in the towns where they're from.''</p>
        <p>Two of the three main presidential candidates have barnstormed in the United States in recent weeks. The third, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, initially criticized his opponents for campaigning here. But he has sent his wife and other representatives to the United States, run campaign ads in American newspapers, and last week met just south of the border with 350 leaders of Mexicans in Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities.</p>
        <p>There are even telephone calling cards being marketed in the United States that feature a 10-second message, complete with swelling music, from Vicente Fox Quesada, the opposition candidate running neck and neck with Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>Mexicans living in the United States can vote only if they have election cards and go to Mexico on July 2. Mr. Fox, of the National Action Party, and the other main candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, have sponsored caravans to take Mexicans who qualify from cities as far-flung as New York and Yakima, Wash.</p>
        <p>For those staying at home, Mexicans in New York, Florida, Illinois, California, Texas, Iowa, Washington, Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere are holding symbolic elections, and will deliver their ballots to Mexican election officials to register their political views.</p>
        <p>For decades, Mexicans here had been dismissed by the Mexican government, and no effort was made to involve them in the political system. But now, Mexicans abroad have reached such a critical mass -- an estimated one in nine Mexicans lives in the United States -- and have become an economic lifeline for countless people in Mexico. Mexicans here send about $7 billion a year to their families and to churches and public programs in their hometowns, the country's third biggest source of legal foreign exchange, after oil and tourism.</p>
        <p>''It used to be presidential candidates couldn't leave the country for six months before an election -- Mexicans were that afraid of foreign influence,'' said Rodolfo de la Garza, a political science professor at the University of Texas. ''I was quite surprised when these guys were up here running around, campaigning.''</p>
        <p>Professor de la Garza said some emigrants had begun ''influencing politics in Mexico,'' adding, ''They shape the local campaign, get the local government to respond to domestic pressures, embarrass the mayor by saying, 'We're not going to give you this money.' ''</p>
        <p>While he and other observers say it is unclear how many Mexicans here are intensely interested in Mexico's politics and thus how influential they will be, at least some are paying close attention. Mr. Fox got a rally and parade in Chicago in May, and some people are actively coaching relatives about Sunday's election.</p>
        <p>Not being allowed to vote in Mexico's elections is a major issue for some Mexicans here. Other immigrants here have the right to vote in their home countries, but the number of Mexicans in the United States --  possibly 15 percent of the Mexican electorate -- makes it sensitive for the Mexican government and a potentially touchy subject for American politicians too.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mexico's Congress passed a bill to give expatriate Mexicans the right to cast ballots at certain foreign locations, but the bill was blocked in the Senate by the PRI. That has made the issue even bigger here, and both Mr. Fox and Mr. Cardenas champion it. Mexicans here are presumed to be more supportive of opposition candidates because they blame the PRI for economic hardships that prompted them to emigrate.</p>
        <p>On visits here, PRI representatives say they support voting rights too, although they express wariness about cost and complexity.</p>
        <p>''We are in favor of Mexicans here having the right to vote,'' said Francisco Guerrero Aguirre, a senior PRI official campaigning for Mr. Labastida this week in Chicago, where a Mexican population of an estimated one million is second only to that of Los Angeles. ''We are concerned about how it will be implemented. Imagine the possibility of fraud or intervention of other countries. But the PRI is very much interested in having contact with Mexicans in the U.S.''</p>
        <p>The symbolic elections, in which people with proof of Mexican citizenship can vote at mock polling places on street corners and outside neighborhood grocery stores, are partly meant to keep the voting rights issue alive.</p>
        <p>''We know that our vote is not going to be used in the elections, but we can use this information to have influence,'' said Joel Magallan, executive director of Tepeyac Association, a Mexican organization in New York, who said there would be 15 polling places in the city, one in Harlem and others in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. He said sending the voting list to Mexico would also prevent unscrupulous people from casting ballots under the names of emigres.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the prospect of Mexican congressmen who live in the United States is considered more than symbolic.</p>
        <p>''If these guys win congressional seats, that would really be big,'' said Professor de la Garza. France has an elected representative for overseas citizens, but some Mexicans are talking about going considerably farther. The National Action Party recently introduced a proposal in Congress to reserve 10 of the 500 seats for Mexicans abroad, and others talk of slates of United States candidates in the 2003 congressional elections.</p>
        <p>The Party of the Democratic Revolution has two candidates in this election, Raul Ross Pineda, director of Mexican affairs for the American Friends Service Committee in Chicago, and Jose Jacques Medina, a community organizer in Los Angeles. The PRI candidate is Eddie Varon Levy, a lawyer in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The candidates are not named on the ballot, but are on regional party slates. The more votes a party gets in a region, the more congressmen it gets. By that calculus, Mr. Ross and Mr. Varon are considered likely winners, while Mr. Jacques is less likely.</p>
        <p>If they win, they plan to commute to Mexico at least part of the time Congress is in session -- about six months a year, in two-month stretches. Their priorities include streamlining the process for sending money to Mexico, making it easier for Mexicans abroad to invest in their hometowns, and influencing United States  immigration and drug policies.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be a special kind of congressman,'' said Mr. Ross, who advocates voting rights for Mexicans abroad and will not be voting in Mexico on Sunday. ''My main obligation is going to be to represent people who live in the United States.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Varon said, ''We'll set up offices here too -- in Oklahoma, Chicago, California, wherever concentrations of Mexicans are.''</p>
