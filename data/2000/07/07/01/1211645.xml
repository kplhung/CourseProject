        <p>The Oracle Corporation, the world's second-largest software publisher, said tonight that Raymond Lane, its president and chief operating officer, had abruptly resigned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane, 53, had been at Oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking executive in one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies, he has always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive and co-founder, Lawrence J.

        <p>The Oracle Corporation, the world's second-largest software publisher, said tonight that Raymond Lane, its president and chief operating officer, had abruptly resigned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane, 53, had been at Oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking executive in one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies, he has always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive and co-founder, Lawrence J. Ellison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane's departure came just days after the company admitted that it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation, in an effort to prove that Microsoft was secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the federal antitrust lawsuit against it.</p>
        <p>The spying operation led to several exposes based on documents that were supplied to reporters at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>In a short statement announcing Mr. Lane's departure, Oracle gave no indication why Mr. Lane had chosen to resign. Mr. Lane made no public statement today and could not be reached tonight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane will continue to serve on Oracle's board of directors, the company said.</p>
        <p>''I am grateful to Ray for all of his efforts,'' Mr. Ellison said in a statement. ''He will be missed. We wish him nothing but the best.''</p>
        <p>An Oracle spokeswoman, Jennifer Glass, declined to comment on why Mr. Lane was leaving his post. But she said his departure was not due to the Microsoft controversy.</p>
        <p>''It is absolutely unrelated,'' she said, to the events that exploded this week when Oracle executives admitted the company had hired the Washington detective firm of Investigative Group International in an effort to link Microsoft to public relations efforts in its behalf during the trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lane's departure has been rumored for months. Tonight, several people familiar with the company's internal strategy said that Mr. Lane's role has decreased in the past year and that Mr. Ellison has increasingly guided the company in a direction different from the one advocated by Mr. Lane.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 7, 2000, Friday  An article in some copies of Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Raymond Lane, president of the Oracle Corporation, referred imprecisely to press reports that Oracle's software rival, Microsoft, had underwritten groups backing Microsoft's antitrust defense. The error was repeated on Sunday in the Economic View column in Money &amp; Business, about the exchange of invective between Oracle and Microsoft. The accounts of Microsoft's financial support, in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, focused on two groups that are now known to have been targets of an Oracle-sponsored investigation. But none of the newspapers have said the documents cited in their coverage came from the Oracle operation; they have not identified the sources of their information.</p>
