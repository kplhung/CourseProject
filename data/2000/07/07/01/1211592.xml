        <p>The good news for Daniel Atien za's fans  all three of them -- is that the 25-year-old Spaniard is still in the Tour de France. The bad news is that his status is shaky because the race has not started yet.</p>
        <p>Atienza, a hewer of wood and bearer of water for the Saeco team from Italy, is part of the nine-man team only because Mario Cipollini is not.</p>
        <p>Cipollini, 33, the star sprinter and team leader, hurt some ribs in a crash during a training ride two weeks ago. At first he announced that he would not ride in the Tour de France, in which he won four consecutive daily stages last year. But lately he has been wavering.</p>
        <p>With hours to go before the team rosters are official, Cipollini is still out, so Atienza is still in.</p>
        <p>Will the Italian, a master of theatrics, appear in Futuroscope at the last minute for Saturday's opening time trial, clad in the Julius Caesar toga he favors for special occasions and oust his doppelganger?</p>
        <p>That question may be somewhat less than burning but it is as big as they come in the torpid countdown for the 20 teams preparing for Saturday's start of the three-week, 2,274-mile race in Futuroscope.</p>
        <p>A better question might be why Futuroscope? The technology theme park, a shrine to the pocket-protector set, is a favorite with the Tour de France, and not only because its owner, the Amaury publishing company, is also the main shareholder in Futuroscope. That deal went through on March 28, but the bicycle race has been coming here to western France since 1986, a year before the park officially opened. The area was a wasteland then, a condition not notably improved by the addition of the Lake of Images and Cyber Avenue.</p>
        <p>This visit did not have to happen. Another candidate for the start was Guadeloupe, a prospect that stirred the blood. But, in place of gentle Caribbean breezes and beaches of soft volcanic sand, there will be guided visits to the Gyrotour and Our Friend, the Radio Telescope.</p>
        <p>Futuroscope is more practical, the organizers insist, with an abundance of hotels and parking lots -- and no need to fly 180 riders and their entourage halfway round the world. Including the start in 1990, the Tour de France has visited the park five times before this weekend. The race has never been to Guadeloupe.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, back to the Futuroscope it is.</p>
        <p>As part of the prerace festivities, the riders were assembled today for an address by race officials about their responsibilities toward the public and the sport itself. That translated basically into a warning about drugs.</p>
        <p>''Who will take the risk of playing with fire and ruining his reputation?'' Jean-Marie Leblanc, the head of the organizers, said. He called for ''a serene atmosphere with no suspicion, a return to the friendliness of the past.''</p>
        <p>That was a reference to the widespread news media speculation about drugs that has plagued the Tour de France since the Festina scandal two years ago. The Festina team was expelled then for systematic use of illegal performance-enhancing substances, notably EPO, and several teams quit to protest police searches.</p>
        <p>Leblanc congratulated the International Cycling Union, which oversees the sport, for its decision last week to freeze selected riders' urine samples and test them for EPO once a new French examination for the artificial hormone has been officially approved -- supposedly a matter of months.</p>
        <p>Riders, Leblanc pointed out, thus face being disqualified and penalized long after the race ends in Paris on July 23.</p>
        <p>''The Tour de France is a monument of cycling,'' he said, ''and we have a duty to protect it. In three weeks, when the Tour has finished, let us hope that the race's reputation has been completely restored.''</p>
        <p>Many riders have publicly welcomed the testing decision, as did Lance Armstrong, the defending champion, at a news conference Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I'm sick of the myth of widespread doping in cycling, and it really is a myth,'' Armstrong said. ''This sport has been singled out and it's doing everything it can.''</p>
