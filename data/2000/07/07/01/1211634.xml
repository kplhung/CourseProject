        <p>An attendant at a service station in a remote spot overlooking Interstate 78 in central New Jersey was shot and killed Thursday night by a robber, who then fled, the police said.</p>
        <p>The attendant, Joseph H. Sass, was giving directions to a woman and her daughter at the King George Exxon Station in Bernards Township at 9:22 p.m., when a man approached on foot, robbed Mr. Sass and shot him once in the head, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sass, 31, of Phillipsburg, N.J., was pronounced dead at Morristown Memorial Hospital a short time later. The two women, and a mechanic who was inside doing repair work, were not hurt.</p>
        <p>The station is just off a highway exit ramp in a heavily wooded area of Somerset County along King George Road, about a half-mile from its nearest neighbors.</p>
        <p>Chief Thomas Kelly of the Bernards Township police, said Mr. Sass had worked at the station for 12 years.</p>
        <p>The gunman had asked for change from a $5 bill, and while Mr. Sass was getting it, he took out a handgun, demanded money, placed the gun against the attendant's head and fired one shot, Chief Kelly said. He said the gunman then fled in a waiting van, which headed west toward Pennsylvania.</p>
