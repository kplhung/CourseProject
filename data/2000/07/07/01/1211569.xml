        <p>Editorial on latest plans for redeveloping Columbus Circle, building that promises to reconnect circle to New York City's street grid and to fall of light from western sky; hopes Columbus Center can mend long-blighted site, even it can never re-knit neighborhood destroyed by Robert Moses decades ago</p>

        <p>At the moment, the Coliseum, on the west side of Columbus Circle, is little more than a hole shrouded in ragged walls gouged out by demolition crews. It is hard to believe that New York City  has lived with the Coliseum, which was built by  the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and is the legacy of Robert Moses, for 44 years. When it was built, it was a conceptual stepping stone toward the future Lincoln Center, toward a new and controversial vision of the West Side. But it was also  a hideous stepping stone, an emblem of unsettling discontinuities in architecture and traffic patterns, an unwelcome barrier to the city's western horizon and, ultimately, to redevelopment of Columbus  Circle.</p>
        <p>Soon the Coliseum will be just a memory, and in its place will arise a building that promises to visually realign Columbus Circle, to reconnect the circle to the geometric street grid, to Broadway's axial disturbance, and to the fall of light from the western sky. Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the new Columbus Center will have twin glass and steel towers, skewed to Broadway's axis, rising above a base that follows Columbus Circle's arc.

        <p>At the moment, the Coliseum, on the west side of Columbus Circle, is little more than a hole shrouded in ragged walls gouged out by demolition crews. It is hard to believe that New York City  has lived with the Coliseum, which was built by  the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and is the legacy of Robert Moses, for 44 years. When it was built, it was a conceptual stepping stone toward the future Lincoln Center, toward a new and controversial vision of the West Side. But it was also  a hideous stepping stone, an emblem of unsettling discontinuities in architecture and traffic patterns, an unwelcome barrier to the city's western horizon and, ultimately, to redevelopment of Columbus  Circle.</p>
        <p>Soon the Coliseum will be just a memory, and in its place will arise a building that promises to visually realign Columbus Circle, to reconnect the circle to the geometric street grid, to Broadway's axial disturbance, and to the fall of light from the western sky. Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the new Columbus Center will have twin glass and steel towers, skewed to Broadway's axis, rising above a base that follows Columbus Circle's arc. The Coliseum blocked 59th Street, but at Columbus Center an atrium will create a thoroughfare for sightlines along 59th Street once again, reuniting east and west.</p>
        <p>The city whose interrupted fabric Columbus Center rejoins is vastly different from the one in which the Coliseum was first erected. The scale of Columbus Center, as well as its tenants, reflects that difference. This will be a media hub, the headquarters of AOL-Time Warner. It will house Jazz at Lincoln Center, extending Lincoln Center's cultural hegemony southward and eastward. It will provide condominium apartments, parking, an enormous amount of retail space and a hotel. If it were built out on the open plains somewhere, Columbus Center would be, in effect, a city in itself.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, too, Columbus Center can bring a kind of peace to a troubled site. Since the Coliseum closed in 1986, the site has gone through several redevelopment plans, each of them creating a mixture of animosity and despair. In part, this, too, is the legacy of Robert Moses. The Coliseum is an apt emblem of the profound ambiguity of Moses' achievement, which was both monumental and more than a little inhuman.</p>
        <p>There is no reknitting the neighborhood that was cleared to make way for what Moses built on the West Side, nor should there be. But in the plans for Columbus Center, there is the vision of a multiplicity of uses, an overlap of commerce and culture, nexus and oasis, that reflects the rescaled realities of life in this city. Mr. Childs and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who played a key role in imagining Columbus Center, deserve congratulations.</p>
