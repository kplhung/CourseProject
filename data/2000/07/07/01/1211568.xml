        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is unclear what fresh insight we are meant to gain from your June 25 front-page report (''View From New York Streets: No Retreat by Police'') that adolescent men who congregate on the street to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol harbor animosity toward the police who arrest them for it.</p>
        <p>Their intense dislike of law enforcement probably comes from an intersection of factors: that adolescent males are known to question authority, that popular music and culture reflect and compound this dislike and that they seem to enjoy doing something that is at the present time illegal.</p>

        <p>The paradox is that thousands of young minority males -- many of whom are the ones so critical of aggressive policing -- are alive today only because of the precipitous drop in the crime rate.</p>
