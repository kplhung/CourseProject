        <p>AT&amp;T Considers Spinoff Of Long-Distance Business  AT&amp;T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone operation, the largest in the nation, as a separately traded tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.</p>
        <p>One reason AT&amp;T may want to issue a new stock to track the long-distance unit is that its shares have languished recently. AT&amp;T hit a new 52-week low during trading yesterday and closed at $31.8125, down 31.25 cents. Management is eager to bolster the stock price and believes that issuing a tracking stock might accomplish that if the shrinking consumer long-distance unit was separate. [Page C14.]</p>
        <p>E-Signature Bill Is Signed Into Law  President Clinton signed legislation giving legal weight to electronic signatures. At a ceremony in Philadelphia, the president used both the traditional felt-tip pen signature and the more high-technology method of inserting a signature card into a computer. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Oracle's President Steps Down  Oracle, the world's second-largest software publisher, said that Raymond Lane, its president and chief opperating officer, had abruptly resigned. Mr. Lane, at Oracle for eight years, had held the post of president since 1996. [C3]</p>
        <p>Doctors Seek Antitrust Exemption  Elated with a victory in the House, doctors opened a campaign to persuade the Senate to give them an exemption from antitrust laws so they could bargain collectively with insurance companies over fees and other issues. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said he would stand in their way. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Personal Spending and Income Rise  Consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported, matching expectations. Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in May, slightly more than expected. [C3.]</p>
        <p>2nd-Quarter Slump for Underwriters  The amount raised in the United States by investment banks in stock and bond offerings -- $451 billion -- was down 24 percent from the second quarter of 1999. Fees for underwriting new issues sank about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier. [C14.]</p>
        <p>$765 Million Investment in Italtel  Cisco Systems and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice agreed to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making the company independent from its Italian parent, it will become more competitive. The investors said they hope to sell shares of the new company to the public soon. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Russia Exerts Control Over Gazprom  Russia's government strengthened its influence over Gazprom, the natural gas giant. Shareholders voted in a new board, tipping the balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company. The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Japan Rescues a Department Store  Japan's Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged with overseeing reform in the banking system, said the government would spend 97 billion yen, or $924 million, of taxpayer money to help rescue Sogo, a highly indebted department store. [C2.]</p>
        <p>U.S. Markets to Close Early  The stock market and other financial markets in the United States will close at 1 p.m. Monday and be closed on Tuesday in observance of the Fourth of July. Most overseas markets, however, will be open both days. United States markets will reopen on Wednesday.</p>
