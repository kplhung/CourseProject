        <p>The lower house of Parliament voted solidly today to give the Kremlin the right to fire any of Russia's 89 regional governors for cause, handing President Vladimir V. Putin another powerful weapon in his bid to centralize power in Moscow.</p>
        <p>The lower house, or Duma, voted 399 to 9 in favor of the proposal, which now goes to the upper house. The landslide vote means that the measure almost certainly will become law no matter how the upper house votes, because the Duma would need only 300 votes to override action by the upper house.</p>

        <p>The lower house of Parliament voted solidly today to give the Kremlin the right to fire any of Russia's 89 regional governors for cause, handing President Vladimir V. Putin another powerful weapon in his bid to centralize power in Moscow.</p>
        <p>The lower house, or Duma, voted 399 to 9 in favor of the proposal, which now goes to the upper house. The landslide vote means that the measure almost certainly will become law no matter how the upper house votes, because the Duma would need only 300 votes to override action by the upper house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has moved quickly to rein in the governors, potentially powerful political forces who sometimes have run their regions as autocrats, almost independent of Moscow.</p>
        <p>The Duma already has passed another bill that would sweep the governors from their guaranteed seats in the upper house of Parliament, diluting their influence in Moscow and, just as important, ending their immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>
        <p>Federal investigators are looking into political corruption in two-thirds of the 89 regions, officials say. If the legislation passed today becomes law, Mr. Putin will be able to dismiss a governor for any violation of the Russian Constitution, as long as a federal court approves the act.</p>
