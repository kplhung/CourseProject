        <p>Stocks plunged in the second quarter of the year, leaving all the major indexes down for the first half as the Federal Reserve continued to try to slow the economy.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index lost 13.3 percent in the quarter, its first loss since the third quarter of 1998. The decline more than wiped out its January-March advance and left it down 2.5 percent for the first six months of the year.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average declined 4.3 percent in the second quarter and is now down 9.1 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index slumped 2.9 percent in the quarter and closed out the first half down 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Investors also decided that many high-technology and Internet shares were overpriced and that it was time to cash in some profits, sending many issues plummeting.  Amazon.com, the cyberspace retailer, closed midyear at 36 5/16 after trading as high as 106 11/16 during the Christmas shopping season.</p>
        <p>''We clearly did deflate a good portion of the speculative bubble called the Internet,'' said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisers in Boston. ''A number of investors finally recognized that there is risk in the risk-reward equation.''</p>
        <p>But investment money has to go somewhere and this time the beneficiaries tended to be drug and other health care companies, real estate investment trusts and utilities. Stocks of semiconductor companies also climbed.</p>
        <p>And technology was not a one-way street. After hitting a record 5,048.62 late in the first quarter, March 10, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite fell as low as 3,164.55 on May 23 before recovering to 4,064.01 on June 21 and then tailing off again. It closed yesterday at 3,966.11.</p>
        <p>''The Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point tightening was a bit of a watershed,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Corporation, referring to a May 16 increase of half a percentage point in the overnight lending rate.</p>
        <p>''In mid-May, things suddenly reversed'' in the stock market, he added. ''Interest-rate sensitive stocks went out of favor and tech came back in.''</p>
        <p>Still, investors shied away from fledgling companies, many of them with no profits and scarcely any revenue. A flurry of 18 initial public offerings reached the market this week to lift the quarter's total to 104, but this was far short of the 141 companies that went public in the first three months of the year.</p>
        <p>''The world changed,'' said Richard Peterson, market analyst at Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks initial public offerings,  noting that 52 of the 104 deals were marketed at prices below the range projected in their original filings. In the first quarter 91 of these issues were priced above the filing range.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the quarter's biggest Nasdaq stars were technology companies, led by the Ixys Corporation, a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, Calif. With a 3 3/8-point surge yesterday. to 53 3/8, the stock nearly quadrupled from its March 31 price of 13 9/16. Adept Technology, up 6 11/16 yesterday, ended the quarter at 46 3/4, up from 12 on March 31. The biggest loser, excluding companies that filed for bankruptcy, was Fidelity Holdings of Kew Gardens, Queens, which lost 94 percent of its value, closing at 1 1/4.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange, Keithley Instruments, which makes electronic measuring equipments, soared 264 percent followed by Lilly Industries, up 142 percent.</p>
        <p>Entrade, a Northfield, Ill., business-to-business Internet company, plunged 77 percent, to 7 1/16. The Chyron Corporation and Dynex Capital also lost more than 70 percent of their market value.</p>
        <p>The average technology mutual fund fell about 13 percent during the quarter, according to Christopher Traulsen, an analyst for Morningstar. This contrasted with an 18 percent advance in the first three months of 2000. Last year, the average tech fund soared 135 percent.</p>
        <p>''There was some flight to quality, into bigger, steadier companies'' within the technology stock group, Mr. Traulsen said.</p>

        <p>Share Prices Climb  By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Stock prices rose as investors bet the decline in technology shares on Thursday was overdone.</p>
        <p>Cisco Systems and Microsoft led the Nasdaq composite index higher, even as the gauge completed its first losing quarter since 1998.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index rose 88.88 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,966.11, after dropping 1.6 percent Thursday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 12.21 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,454.60. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 49.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,447.89.</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices were mixed. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 103 16/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.02 percent. The 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 105 1/32. Its yield rose to 5.89 percent from 5.87.</p>
