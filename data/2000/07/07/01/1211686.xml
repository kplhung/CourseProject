        <p>HAUSMAN-Lila. We extend our sincerest condolences to Honey Rackman, Faigy Toporovsky and Shaindy Hausman on the passing of their beloved mother. The ''Perle Mesta'' of Crown Heights and a true ''Woman of Valor'', Lila embodied the qualities of elegance, charm and kindness. As a Founder of the Medical Center, and a devoted member of the National Women's Division, Honey, together with her husband Michael, have followed in her footsteps in their love and support of important Jewish causes that build and strengthen Israel. May the entire family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Amer. Comm. for Shaare Zedek Jerusalem Med. Ctr. Erica Jesselson, Chair Lee Weinbach, Pres., Nat'l Women's Div.</p>
