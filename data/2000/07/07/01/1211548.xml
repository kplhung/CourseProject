        <p>Titles can be misleading or even uncommunicative. As an example there is Trisha Brown, who has completed the choreography for her ambitious and inventive three-part work to jazz scores by Dave Douglas. With a fine combo led by Mr. Douglas in the pit, the Trisha Brown Dance Company offered the first performance of the entire production on Thursday night in Page Auditorium as part of the American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University here.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown calls the piece as a whole ''The Trilogy,'' and a trilogy is certainly what it is. But that austere title does not even hint at the quirkiness and imagination of her choreography and Mr. Douglas's music. Fortunately, each section of ''The Trilogy'' has its own fanciful title.</p>

        <p>Titles can be misleading or even uncommunicative. As an example there is Trisha Brown, who has completed the choreography for her ambitious and inventive three-part work to jazz scores by Dave Douglas. With a fine combo led by Mr. Douglas in the pit, the Trisha Brown Dance Company offered the first performance of the entire production on Thursday night in Page Auditorium as part of the American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University here.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown calls the piece as a whole ''The Trilogy,'' and a trilogy is certainly what it is. But that austere title does not even hint at the quirkiness and imagination of her choreography and Mr. Douglas's music. Fortunately, each section of ''The Trilogy'' has its own fanciful title.</p>
        <p>The first two sections, both for ensembles, were seen in New York in May during the company's season at the Joyce Theater. The third section, also for an ensemble, received its premiere at the festival. In New York the excerpts from ''The Trilogy'' were presented on programs with other dances and were separated from them by intermissions. But at the festival the entire trilogy was performed without an intermission and the group sections were separated by new solos created for Diane Madden. The production lasted slightly less than 90 minutes.</p>
        <p>For ''Five Part Weather Invention,'' the opening ensemble, Terry Winters, the production's designer, created an abstract backdrop that contrasted straight lines with squiggles, and it seemed to glow in Jennifer Tipton's lighting. Straight lines and squiggles also dominated Ms. Brown's choreography, which was commissioned by the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.</p>
        <p>Dancers kept going in and out of order. They marched in lines, only to fidget and whirl this way and that. The music had its own surprising juxtapositions, as when sharp outbursts were followed by slithering sounds. At one point Mr. Douglas's score even required the musicians to cough.</p>
        <p>The movement looked spontaneous but the apparent disorder was artfully planned. That was demonstrated when a dancer fell in what seemed a terrible accident. But she recovered, and moments later, other dancers fell in the same way.</p>
        <p>After this ensemble came ''Interval 1,'' the first of Ms. Brown's solos for Ms. Madden. As stagehands adjusted lights and scenery in view of the audience, Ms. Madden danced to percussion music played by Susie Ibarra. The solo, filled with sudden stops and starts and unexpected shifts of position, created the impression that Ms. Madden's mind and body were telling her to move in contradictory ways.</p>
        <p>Then came ''Rapture to Leon James,'' commissioned by the American Dance Festival and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts through the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern Dance and Jazz Music Collaborations and the National Endowment for the Arts. A slim pole adorned with cymbals served as the set for this ensemble, named after a Lindy Hopper of the 1930's. The dancers often assembled in couples, yet only rarely did they touch. But the extremely busy choreography required them to do a lot of twisting, swiveling, darting and finger snapping. It was as if Ms. Brown were trying to invent her own form of jitterbugging.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madden had a stepladder attached to her body in ''Interval 2,'' her second solo. As stagehands once again went about their work, she tilted from side to side to plaintive violin music played by Mark Feldman. The ladder kept opening and closing, creating changing shapes in space. After Ms. Madden set it on the floor, she climbed it and dangled from it.</p>
        <p>''The Trilogy'' concluded with the new ''Groove and Countermove,'' commissioned by the American Dance Festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work. For this complex yet beguiling romp, Mr. Winters designed a backdrop showing 24 separate panels, each adorned with its own lines and squiggles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Douglas's music had an attractive pulsing rhythm and Ms. Brown's dancers moved to it in a loose-limbed, easygoing manner. Sometimes they would freeze as if turned to statues, only to snap back to life. Droopy movements were contrasted with crisp ones, finicky steps gave way to bounces. Each movement in ''Groove and Countermove'' did indeed appear to have a counterpart. And both this finale and ''The Trilogy'' as a whole were groovy.</p>
