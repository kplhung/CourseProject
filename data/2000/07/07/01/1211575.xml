        <p>Editorial Observer on overheated quality of New York's Senate campaign, with Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio hammering away at each other with ferocity that usually does not surface until October</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Senate campaign in New York already has an overheated quality, like a machine that is revving at full throttle minutes after a jump-start. Four months before Election Day, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio are hammering each other with a ferocity that usually does not surface until October. Their intensity raises an intriguing question. What are they saving to use after Labor Day?</p>
        <p>The problems for each are fairly obvious. Mr. Lazio's late start means that he must fix an image of himself in the public mind before she does. Mrs. Clinton, whose well-known liabilities turn up in virtually every poll, must use advertising and speeches to add a negative to Mr. Lazio's portfolio for every negative on her side. That way, come November, people may be debating issues more than personalities.</p>

        <p>The Senate campaign in New York already has an overheated quality, like a machine that is revving at full throttle minutes after a jump-start. Four months before Election Day, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio are hammering each other with a ferocity that usually does not surface until October. Their intensity raises an intriguing question. What are they saving to use after Labor Day?</p>
        <p>The problems for each are fairly obvious. Mr. Lazio's late start means that he must fix an image of himself in the public mind before she does. Mrs. Clinton, whose well-known liabilities turn up in virtually every poll, must use advertising and speeches to add a negative to Mr. Lazio's portfolio for every negative on her side. That way, come November, people may be debating issues more than personalities.</p>
        <p>For their part, Mr. Lazio and his advisers have to work on adding gravitas and on sanding down any sharp ideological edges. So far, the Clinton campaign may be ahead in this definitional contest. It has successfully nailed Mr. Lazio's political inconsistencies and missed Congressional votes. Such tactics can easily backfire, however, if Mrs. Clinton can be accused of ginning up the mighty White House machine in the interest of sacrificing a lone congressman to her ambition.</p>
        <p>Moreover, by ferreting out the details of Mr. Lazio's votes on abortion, patients' rights, hate crimes and gun control, Mrs. Clinton does more than raise questions about whether he talks like a New York moderate but votes like a Washington conservative. The first lady also raises questions about her own lack of a voting record and, indeed, her lack of substantial political experience independent of her husband.</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Clinton has so far had her share of luck. Just as the independent counsel spared her any charges on the travel office firings at the White House, Mr. Lazio began facing his own troubles with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The S.E.C. has been investigating whether Mr. Lazio violated insider trading laws three years ago by investing in a company controlled by some of his largest contributors. Mr. Lazio has denied any impropriety, and his supporters have angrily labeled the investigation a Democratic dirty trick. Detailed scrutiny of a candidate's past, however, is part of the campaign experience for everyone, as Mrs. Clinton knows only too well.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign is also running fairly smoothly, while Mr. Lazio's effort, after a strong launch, has been showing signs of stress. He has made the kinds of missteps that afflicted Mrs. Clinton a year ago. One mistake was for Mr. Lazio to skip a gay pride parade in New York City in favor of a farm stop upstate. He missed a chance to pick up votes he might not get otherwise in order to talk to a crowd that already favors him. Mr. Lazio's claims that he will have an open campaign have worn thin as journalists have been blocked or limited in their queries. A missed vote on heating oil and a vote against disclosure of the new secret 527 slush funds have become easy fodder for Mrs. Clinton, although Mr. Lazio was able to strike back on the heating-oil vote by pointing out that one of her Congressional supporters skipped it in order to raise money with her. Lazio aides admit their man has looked a little off-balance. They argue that he entered the campaign as if shot from a cannon and will soon settle down.</p>
        <p>Republicans complaining about the stream of money coming to Mrs. Clinton are taking steps to compete, as they illustrated this week with a Manhattan fund-raiser that took in $1.7 million. Almost weekly a new poll shows that despite the lopsided appearance of a contest between a celebrity first lady and a barely recognized congressman, this contest remains so tantalizingly close that it is worth -- and will require -- major expenditure of money and energy by both parties.</p>
