        <p>A handful of games into Andre Agassi's unnerving fifth-set slide toward extinction today, the introspective soul-searcher stopped his service motion to allow a bird to swoop into, circle and then exit Center Court.</p>
        <p>It was not the carrier pigeon that he was looking for. There was no message to help Agassi decode the unassuming but unrelenting Todd Martin as Agassi continued to plunge into a 2-5 chasm.</p>
        <p>But on his way to saving two match points, Agassi came to rely on Martin's demons to aid his tense and improbable 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (3), 2-6, 10-8 escape on the fifth day of Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>From across the net, the second-seeded Agassi watched his American counterpart lose his nerve on returns, try too much on second serves and begin missing forehand volleys on floating returns that dangled in front of Martin's eyes like soap bubbles.</p>
        <p>It was like 1996 again, when in the semifinals at Wimbledon, Center Court became a burial site for Martin's composure when he failed to close out MaliVai Washington after taking a 5-1 lead in the fifth and final set only to lose by what is now the hauntingly familiar score of 10-8.</p>
        <p>''I think it is possible for players to develop certain reputations where you can count on certain weaknesses,'' Agassi said. ''I wouldn't put the label 'choking' on Todd. While there was a certain opportunity he definitely let go of, it takes a lot more than one time before you feel like that's actually a weakness of a certain player.</p>
        <p>''So at 5-2 down, while I was aware of the fact that he's managed to do that here before on Center Court, I certainly didn't expect it. But when I got the break with the double fault at 30-all, it did start crossing my mind, 'Make him play, at least make him win it.' ''</p>
        <p>It took a while. A 3-hour-47-minute match that was suspended by rain after three sets and one game of play Thursday night finally ended today after a 70-minute fifth set.</p>
        <p>The resilience of Pete Sampras, the defending champion, was not tested today. After tendinitis crept into his lower left shin Wednesday, Sampras was given another day of rest when his third-round match with Justin Gimelstob was postponed until Saturday because of rain.</p>
        <p>The elements also washed out Venus Williams's third-round match. Between rain delays, Williams sat as a hooded spectator for her sister's match against Cristina Torrens-Valero. Against a backdrop of wild applause, Serena Williams walked onto Court 1 in her white warmup jacket, with her first name stitched stylishly across the back. It might as well have been a heavyweight boxer's shiny silk robe. With 12 aces, Serena Williams unleashed a flurry of power to dismiss the Spaniard, 6-2, 6-1.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking good, and I'm feeling good,'' said Serena Williams, looking for her second Grand Slam title after winning the United States Open last summer. ''I think that I'm actually doing a lot of things better than I was at the Open.''</p>
        <p>The runner-up to Williams at the United States Open was taking note. Understanding how sharp she will have to be to get past Williams should they meet in the semifinals, Martina Hingis made quick work of the 22nd-ranked Silvija Talaja of Croatia, 6-2, 6-2, to advance to the Round of 16.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a great situation here,'' said Hingis, who was defeated in the first round here last year. ''I have nothing to defend. I just can get better.''</p>
        <p>Barring an upset, Hingis and Venus Williams will meet in the quarterfinals. Today, jumping ahead was a matter of reflex. Because for another day, the American dream final of Sampras and Agassi still has life after Martin experienced a recreation of his 1996 collapse on Center Court. Visibly drained from his unthinkable finish, Martin could not deny the similarities.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, for sure, there were points where I got tight, and those were critical points,'' said Martin, who was serving for the match at 5-2 in the fifth set but double-faulted at 30-all. ''From there, you know, I tried to keep '96 in my mind so I could draw from the positives that I found from there.</p>
        <p>''Don't do it again. That was part of it. I was trying not to think so much about, 'O.K., you're up, 5-2, you're serving at 15-all.' You say, 'What's the best way to win this point?' Then, at 30-all, I overhit my first serve, and on the second serve I said, 'You know, let's be aggressive with it.' I remember that's the thing I struggled with most a few years ago. I was aggressive with it, and I didn't make it. Sort of live by the risks, die by the risks.''</p>
        <p>Still, he had a 5-3 lead and two match points on Agassi's serve. But he allowed one second serve by Agassi to handcuff him, and then lost control of a volley.</p>
        <p>''On the serve, it ended up taking a little bit of a low bounce and sliding a little bit,'' Martin said. ''I think if I was a little more composed and a little bit more relaxed, then I can adjust to that ball and get it in play.''</p>
        <p>He couldn't unwind, though, and Agassi drew life from Martin's distress. He took advantage of a backhand by Martin that died into the net for a break point to tie the fifth set at 5-5. Then Agassi continued his run of four straight games by changing his tactics -- coming in on one point, staying back on the next -- to go up, 6-5. Although Martin steadied himself to hold serve in front of a crowd that stirred each time Agassi was in peril, he couldn't hold it together through the end.</p>
        <p>On the 18th game of the fifth set, Agassi watched Martin send a backhand into the net for the final break he needed, the one that gave him the match.</p>
        <p>''You know, I needed a little help from him at 5-2 down,'' Agassi said. ''I was very lucky to get back into that match.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>In an all-American third-round match, JAN-MICHAEL GAMBILL pushed through the first set and then easily dispatched PAUL GOLDSTEIN, 7-6 (10), 6-2, 6-2. After years of failing to meet high expectations as the next great American player, the 23-year-old Gambill has reached the Round of 16 of a Grand Slam for the first time. ''It's never been a burden for people to say, 'You're the next guy,' '' he said. ''It's a huge honor.''</p>
