        <p>Norman Podhoretz is the editor at large of Commentary magazine, a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute and the author of ''My Love Affair With America,'' to be published on Tuesday. Victor Navasky is the publisher and editorial director of The Nation, the Delacorte professor of magazine journalism at Columbia University and the author of ''Naming Names,'' a study of the Hollywood blacklist. For many years they have disagreed, often vehemently, about the issues that shape American life. For this Fourth of July weekend, The New York Times asked them to discuss patriotism. The moderator of the discussion was Barry Gewen, the editor of Arts &amp; Ideas and an editor in the Book Review of The Times.</p>
        <p>Q. Norman, you begin your new book, ''My Love Affair With America,'' with the quotation from Samuel Johnson: ''Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.'' This is probably the single most famous quote about patriotism, and it prompts the question: Has patriotism gone out of style?</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Well, I think Johnson was wrong and this was a most uncharacteristic remark for him, a fervent Tory, to have made, since conservatives, generally in Europe anyway, had been associated with patriotic sentiment and the nationalist sentiment.</p>
        <p>Has patriotism gone out of style in America? The answer is certainly yes, as of very recently. But my own feeling is that it's slowly coming back. We see signs of this resurgence of patriotic sentiment in various sectors of the culture. The most salient, I suppose, would be the enormous success of Tom Brokaw's two books on the World War II generation. I think the success of a movie like ''Saving Private Ryan'' is another sign, a sign of a new respect for the kind of virtues that were traditionally associated with patriotism or love of country.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. Well, about Samuel Johnson: Ambrose Bierce had an amendment to Johnson. I think he said, ''I beg to submit, sir, it is the first.'' In other words, patriotism is not the last refuge of scoundrels, it's the first.</p>
        <p>I don't agree with that. But I think it depends what your definition of patriotism is. I would suggest that in the Vietnam era the people who were protesting the war included a large number of patriots. My definition of patriotism would involve fighting to make sure your country lives up to its highest ideals. And from that perspective even those who burn the flag -- not all of them but some of them -- may have been as patriotic as those who wrapped themselves in the flag.</p>
        <p>So the word may be coming back in some way, but the struggles to make America the best it can be have been going on, it seems to me, since the Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. I would like to take issue with the definition that Victor is offering. To define American patriotism as struggling to make the country live up to its best ideals has in practice generally meant denigrating the country for not doing so. The ideal is very often the enemy of the real.</p>
        <p>The conditions under which Americans have actually lived in one generation or another is the country that one either loves or does not love. One can be critical of the country while loving it, just as one can be critical of one's wife or husband or lover in personal life. But I would submit that the people who burned the flag during the Vietnam War or people who spelled the name of the country with a K to suggest an association with Nazi Germany or people who saw no difference between America and the Soviet Union during the cold war, morally or politically, were not patriots.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. I guess I don't pretend to know the motives of the folks who chose the burning of the flag as their way of protesting the Vietnam War, but I do know that going back to the beginning of our history, and right up through the abolitionist movement and the movement for labor rights in the 1920's and 30's and the movement for civil rights in the 60's, those people who fought to achieve the American dream of equal rights for all were scorned at the time as, in effect, unpatriotic and later on as Communists.</p>
        <p>Q. Let me ask Victor a question about patriotism and liberals and the left. In the period around World War II, there was no embarrassment on the left about engaging in traditional patriotic activities -- flag waving, Fourth of July celebrations -- but these symbols of patriotism seem to have disappeared from the left. Do those symbols now totally belong to conservatives and the right, or does the left have some call to them also?</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. Sure, there was a shared symbology that went across the ideological board. Irving Kristol has written an essay, which Norman cites in his book, where he said that there is a holy trinity associated with American patriotism and it includes the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the flag. I would say two out of three isn't bad. To me, the authentic symbols of our country start with the covenants, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The flag is important only for the principles that it represents.</p>
        <p>Q. Next question: is there a good patriotism and a bad patriotism?</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Yes, though my own view is that patriotism has been so ridiculed and has been so out of fashion that spiritual and moral balance require an emphasis on patriotism as a good thing. I mean, most people would say that when patriotism becomes chauvinistic or jingoistic or even simply nationalistic, it becomes aggressive and dangerous. But the heritage that we fight for is not merely one of rectifying wrongs of the past, such as slavery or discrimination, and trying to create conditions that are more in consonance with what is promulgated, both in the Declaration and the Constitution; it's also to fight off assaults on the system of government that was designed by the Founding Fathers.</p>
        <p>Q. Victor, is there a good patriotism and a bad patriotism?</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. Stephen Decatur, who said, ''Our country right or wrong,'' said first, ''May she always be in the right.'' And that's a good part of patriotism -- to fight to have your country be in the right. A destructive part of patriotism is when it slips into a kind of nationalism which makes you hate other countries, put your country's interests first when you think it's behaving in an immoral and unjust way. So that confusing patriotism with unconditional support for a government policy, it seems to me, does damage, and core damage, to the meaning of citizenship in our democracy.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. But to denigrate the country, to call it foul names, to desecrate its symbols, should not be given the name of patriotism. People who want to do that are free to do that in this country. But I don't think they ought to then wrap themselves in the flag that they've just burned.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. When Frederick Douglass made his famous speech where he said that freedom requires rain and thunder and lightning, what he was talking about was that you have to do a lot of nasty and uncomfortable things to bring the plight of folks who don't have freedom to the national attention. And that is a part of a patriotic America-loving act. It's not an America-hating act to try to bring the African-American community to its entitlement.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. In the civil rights movement, the early civil rights movement in the late 50's and early 60's, the most effective means blacks employed happened to be not nasty, whatever, but nonviolent resistance. Which was perceived by everybody in this country as noble and admirable and which made the sheriffs who were attacking them with water hoses look ignoble and evil. So I don't agree that nasty things necessarily have to be done.</p>
        <p>Q. A great deal of the historical scholarship of the last few decades has examined and brought to light the negative aspects of American history -- slavery, the treatment of American Indians, the detention of Japanese Americans during World War II. How do we fit these negative aspects of American history into education programs for our children?</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Well, I think they have to be faced up to honestly. Children have to be taught that these things happened. They also have to be taught that many -- in fact, I think all of the ones you mentioned -- were acted upon, were corrected. And that they were corrected through the resources of the American constitutional and institutional structure.</p>
        <p>It's very important to teach children that the history of this country is on the whole a glorious one, not an inglorious one. That this is a country to be proud of, including for the way it has dealt with what I would say are the inevitable blemishes and warts. I think that we as a socio-political-economic system rank with such great civilizations of the past as fifth-century Athens and Elizabethan England. Not, as I say in my book, in the production of artistic monuments, though we haven't done so badly in that department either, but in the provision of more liberty and more prosperity to more people than has existed anywhere else on earth, whether present or past. And this, too, has to be taught to our children and should be emphasized.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. I think the way you teach the abolitionists, for instance, is that you make clear that, in terms of your own values, the abolitionists were greater patriots than the plantation owners against whom they were fighting. That the folks who were organizing the workers, in my judgment, were greater patriots than the mine and mill owners who were exploiting them. That the real patriots during the Vietnam War were the folks who resisted it. And the patriots during the civil rights movement were indeed, as Norman said, the folks who adopted passive resistance. And it worked to a degree there.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. I have nothing against the abolitionists, but I would say that my hero in the Civil War is not John Brown but Abraham Lincoln. They were very different and they were not on the same side. And it makes a big difference whether you think it's Abraham Lincoln who should be celebrated or John Brown.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. I think they both should be celebrated, as should Frederick Douglass.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Well, I agree with you about him.</p>
        <p>Q. What impact, if any, has multiculturalism had on our idea of patriotism?</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. I think it requires a revision to this classic notion of my country right or wrong, first of all, depending on when your own group became part of the tradition and entitled to the rights that other folks got.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I think the real contribution of multiculturalism to our culture today is the right of people to establish their own identities and define their own identities.</p>
        <p>And thirdly, multiculturalism suggests that we have a series of competing allegiances. One of them is love of family. A second is love of tribe or culture or whatever it is. A third is love of country. And a fourth is one's relationship to the international community. And it seems to me the most valuable kind of patriotism is one which honors the other relationships rather than competes against them.</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Well, here we go again. I think multiculturalism is a perversion of the traditional American idea of pluralism. The ideal was that in the public sphere -- in the public schools -- the rule of assimilation prevailed. That is, if an immigrant came to this country, he was expected -- and, indeed, wished -- to learn English and to absorb the traditions of his new country, to become an American, to be Americanized. Nothing prevented that individual from remaining loyal, within the private sphere, to the tribe and the family. You were free as an individual to live in both worlds if you chose. But what you were not free to do was to refuse to assimilate to the culture of this country. Nobody was going to arrest you or anything of that sort, but you would certainly limit your opportunities for employment, for advancement and for participation, including civic participation.</p>
        <p>I think that multiculturalism doesn't so much help to give people the power to define their own identities as it keeps them apart from the rest of the community. So I think it's a bad thing and I think it is not -- does not -- contribute to a healthy patriotism.</p>
        <p>Q. Now each of you, if you want, can take a minute or two to say something in summary. Norman?</p>
        <p>PODHORETZ. Yeah, why not. I'll take a crack at it.</p>
        <p>I think intellectual honesty requires us to recognize that we have emerged from a period during which America-bashing, as some call it, or denigration of America, has prevailed, particularly among intellectuals, not so much among most people, but among the elites. I believe this has begun to change. I hope it has begun to change.</p>
        <p>NAVASKY. I guess patriotism is best expressed in the struggle to make this a better place. And it is not best expressed in saluting the flag or in parades down Fifth Avenue but in writing, in marching, in suing, in voting, in going to court, whatever it takes to fulfill the promise of the Bill of Rights.</p>
