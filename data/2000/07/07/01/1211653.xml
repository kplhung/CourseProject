        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced today that he planned to strip the University of California of its responsibility for security at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories after a series of major security lapses at the troubled Los Alamos laboratory.</p>
        <p>The University of California, which has held the government contract to manage Los Alamos since the laboratory opened during World War II to develop the atomic bomb, will continue to run the scientific and research aspects of both Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Richardson said he would immediately seek to renegotiate the university contract and would find a different organization to handle security and facilities management at the two laboratories.</p>
        <p>''The University of California's performance in managing security at our weapons laboratories is unacceptable and must be immediately addressed,'' Mr. Richardson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said he had asked Gen. John A. Gordon, the director of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the new, semi-independent agency that oversees the government's nuclear weapons sites, to handle the contract renegotiations with the University of California and to recommend a new organization to handle laboratory security by Sept. 5.</p>
        <p>''Finding an effective way to improve the security and management at the laboratories without compromising the strength of their cutting-edge science and research will be one of my top priorities,'' General Gordon said in a statement today. The general met with the provost of the University of California on Thursday to inform him of the decision to change the management of laboratory security.</p>
        <p>The president of the University of California, Richard C. Atkinson, offered only a cautious statement in response to Mr. Richardson's actions. ''The U.S. Department of Energy has advised us that it will explore ways in which additional expertise might help address security issues,'' Mr. Atkinson said.</p>
        <p>The University of California's contract to manage the two weapons laboratories has been under scrutiny since last year, following the Wen Ho Lee case. Dr. Lee was fired from Los Alamos in March 1999 for security violations uncovered in connection with the government's investigation of accusations of Chinese espionage at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>After Dr. Lee was dismissed, investigators discovered that he had downloaded vast amounts of secret nuclear data from the classified computer network at Los Alamos and copied it onto portable tapes, some of which are now missing. He was arrested in December on charges of mishandling classified material. He has not been charged with espionage.</p>
        <p>Criticism of the University of California's management has increased over the past month after the discovery that computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets had disappeared from a vault at the Los Alamos site. The two hard drives were found by a laboratory employee, but the F.B.I. is now conducting a criminal investigation at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Lax security at Los Alamos has become a major issue in Congress, and lawmakers have repeatedly questioned Mr. Richardson about whether he would hold the University of California accountable and end its long hold on the laboratory contract.</p>
        <p>The debate over the university's status has also raised broader issues about the inherent conflict between science and security in weapons development.</p>
