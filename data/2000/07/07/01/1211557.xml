        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: NAIL BOMBER SENTENCED -- David Copeland, 24, a confessed fascist, was sentenced to six life terms after a London jury found him guilty of three murders in a series of bombings aimed at the city's gay and nonwhite populations. The three deaths resulted from a nail bomb that devastated a Soho gay bar and injured 139 people. The jury rejected his defense of diminished responsibility.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: NAIL BOMBER SENTENCED -- David Copeland, 24, a confessed fascist, was sentenced to six life terms after a London jury found him guilty of three murders in a series of bombings aimed at the city's gay and nonwhite populations. The three deaths resulted from a nail bomb that devastated a Soho gay bar and injured 139 people. The jury rejected his defense of diminished responsibility.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ON-THE-SPOT FINES -- Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would propose at a special crime summit meeting in London that the police be given power to march drunken rioters to cash machines and make them withdraw $150 fines. English soccer fans caused widespread disturbances in Belgium last week in the Euro 2000 tournament during a game between England and Germany. Mr. Blair spoke at an ethics forum in Tubingen, Germany.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: ANTITERROR BILL DROPPED -- The government withdrew an antiterrorism bill after a fight with Serbian hard-liners of the coalition Radical Party, who are said to have wanted guarantees that they would not become targets of the law. Lawyers and opposition activists say the draft law trampled on human rights and was designed to muzzle critics of President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>TURKEY: EX-PREMIERS CLEARED -- Two former prime ministers supported each other and won parliamentary votes that effectively killed investigations into corruption charges against them. Tansu Ciller had been charged with siphoning $71,000 from a discretionary fund while she was in office, and Mesut Yilmaz was said to have sold mobile phone licenses at giveaway prices. Parliament voted down motions that would have sent the cases to the Supreme Court.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: SECESSION BILL PASSES -- Parliament has given final approval to a bill that will make it harder for Quebec to secede if there is ever a third referendum there. The bill authorizes the Commons to negotiate a province's secession only after a referendum vote where the option of independence is clearly stated and where secessionists win a clear majority. Quebec separatists attacked it as a ''pseudo law'' that sets up English-speaking Canada as a judge of a political process that is internal to Quebec.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>TAIWAN: CHINA HOLDS BUSINESSMAN -- The Chinese police detained a Taiwanese businessman who went to the mainland after retiring from Taiwan's top intelligence and security agency, Taiwan officials and the man's wife said. Pan Hsi-hsien went to China on business for an electronics company after retiring from the National Security Council. His trip violated a Taiwan law that bars top officials from visiting China within three years of retirement. It also raised concerns about whether he would leak information to China.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>HONG KONG: 5,000 ORDERED OUT -- A Hong Kong court ruled that 5,000 mainland immigrants would have to leave. The ruling adhered to the policy set by Beijing last June, when it overturned a decision by Hong Kong's highest court granting residency to mainland immigrants with at least one Hong Kong parent. The ruling applied to immigrants who arrived in Hong Kong after the first court decision and claimed a right to residency under it.</p>
        <p>Mark Landler (NYT)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP LIFTED -- The Supreme Court ruled in a landmark case that censorship imposed on an English-language weekly, The Sunday Leader, and a sister publication was illegal and ordered that the paper be reopened. It was closed for violating guidelines about reporting on the war against separatist Tamil rebels. The court said the chief censor had no authority to censor news reports or close the paper.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: LAND REFORM PLEA -- The head of the land restitution commission said a sizable infusion of cash was essential if efforts to redistribute land to poor blacks were to avoid confrontations like those in Zimbabwe. In both countries, whites still control much of the most fertile land, and since blacks won majority rule in Zimbabwe and South Africa, land reform has been a pressing issue, with more than 63,000 claims pending in South Africa.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: NETANYAHU ON RISE -- A newspaper poll of 590 people showed Benjamin Netanyahu, the rightist former prime minister, beating Prime Minister Ehud Barak by a significant margin -- 8 percent -- for the first time since Mr. Barak beat Mr. Netanyahu and took office a year ago. According to the Maariv-Gallup poll, Mr. Netanyahu would get 44 percent of the votes in a new election, and Mr. Barak 36 percent, with 20 percent undecided.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: CHINA PLANE PLEA -- A leading cabinet member, Haim Ramon, left, told Israeli Radio that Israel should halt the sale of a $250 million airborne radar system to China in order to repair frayed ties with Washington. Martin Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel, told Israeli legislators that American-Israeli ties would suffer if China got the plane, which the United States believes could endanger its forces in the region.</p>
        <p>William A. Orme Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>PACIFIC</p>
        <p>SOLOMON ISLANDS: NEW PREMIER -- Legislators narrowly elected an ex-opposition leader, Mannasseh Sogavare, as the new prime minister, and he pledged to end 19 months of ethnic violence. He replaces Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, who resigned after armed rebels from the island of Malaita invaded Guadalcanal, the main island.</p>
