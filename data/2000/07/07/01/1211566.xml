        <p>Just hours after Albert J. Pirro Jr. was convicted of tax fraud, he began dismantling the lucrative legal career that had helped make him one of Westchester County's leading power brokers, his friends and associates said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro -- the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, Westchester's district attorney -- quietly informed his clients and partners at Pirro, Collier, Cohen &amp; Halpern that he was giving up legal work and cutting his ties to the White Plains law firm where his name was the most prominent one on the letterhead. The firm's receptionists now answer phone calls with ''Collier, Cohen &amp; Halpern.''</p>
        <p>''It is my intent to act in good faith and be as cooperative as possible with regard to my former law partners and clients,'' Mr. Pirro, 53, said in a written statement. ''Therefore, I have voluntarily ceased the practice of law on June 22, 2000. It is my responsibility to take the necessary steps to fulfill all of my ethical obligations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro was convicted last week on 34 counts of conspiracy, tax evasion and filing fraudulent tax returns after claiming more than $1.2 million in personal spending as business expenses. He may face a jail term of three or four years when he is sentenced on Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>Philip M. Halpern, the managing partner of Collier, Cohen &amp; Halpern, said Mr. Pirro had specialized in land use and zoning laws, but he would not comment on how much business Mr. Pirro had brought to the firm. ''It's terribly sad and unfortunate,'' he said of Mr. Pirro's departure, ''but we'll continue to do the good, quality work we've done before.''</p>
        <p>Several lawyers and legal experts said today that Mr. Pirro was resigning on his own terms because he would most likely have been disbarred anyway. ''My sense is it was a service he was doing to his partners and clients to enable a smooth transition,'' said Kerry Lawrence, a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer in White Plains. ''It was something that was going to happen in any event.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Pirro can petition the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court to reinstate him as a lawyer after seven years, his chances are not promising. ''After conviction of a felony, there are some that it happens for, but it's rare,'' said Vincent E. Doyle III, a lawyer who heads the criminal justice section of the New York State Bar Association.</p>
        <p>Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pirro, said he would spend more time with his wife and two children in the next few months and ''carefully weigh other options.'' She would not elaborate on his plans.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Pirro will no longer practice law, he could still command hefty fees as a real estate developer and lobbyist in Albany. In 1999, Mr. Pirro and his lobbying firm, Pirro, Buley &amp; Associates, reported earning at least $901,999 in compensation from clients in the health care, gambling and racing industries. Ms. Roche confirmed that the lobbying business was still operating.</p>
