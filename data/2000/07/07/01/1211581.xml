        <p>Russia's government strengthened its influence over the natural gas giant Gazprom today, loosening the grip of an entrenched management that shareholders say has ignored their interests and obscured the company's operations.</p>
        <p>The government's increased control of the company, the nation's biggest, came in a shareholder vote for a new board., The move reflects a broader effort by President Vladimir V. Putin to exert more authority over the country's most important companies like Gazprom, Russia's biggest earner of cash and the supplier of a quarter of Western Europe's natural gas.</p>
        <p>''This will be a common theme of the Putin presidency -- more control over state assets,'' said Stephen O. Sullivan, head of research at the United Financial Group investment bank in Moscow. ''Gazprom is one of the state's major assets, and it hasn't been well served by the company in terms of shareholder value.''</p>
        <p>In the vote for a new board, shareholders tipped the balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power. Shareholders also blocked Mr. Vyakhirev's proposal to require a near-unanimous board vote to oust him as chief executive. Currently, a simple majority of the 11-member board can remove him.</p>
        <p>A close Putin adviser, Dmitry Medvedev, was elected chairman, replacing former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who used to run Gazprom. Over the last year, Mr. Chernomyrdin's influence in the company has waned. Earlier this week he denied Russian press reports linking him to corruption charges made by a Swiss prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>Minority shareholders won two seats on the Gazprom board, including the first-ever foreign representative. That helped strengthen Gazprom's shares, which soared on foreign exchanges today. Local shares closed up more than 7 percent.</p>
        <p>Gazprom is one of Russia's most popular companies among foreign investors. It is a giant, with expected revenue of $15.9 billion this year, according to the United Financial Group. Management has, however, not adequately monitored the vast assets, investors and analysts say. Of the 546 billion cubic meters of gas produced last year, the annual report showssales of only 474 billion, according to the Moscow-based investment bank Brunswick Warburg. That leaves about 13 percent of production unaccounted for.</p>
