        <p>Despite growing controversy over the use of biotechnology in agriculture, American farmers are not significantly scaling back their planting of genetically altered crops, according to a recent government survey.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department, which conducted the survey, estimates that genetically altered crops were planted on about 69 million acres of American farmland last spring. That compares to about 71 million acres planted with the crops a year ago, according to seed industry estimates.</p>
        <p>The department, however, refused to interpret the figures, saying they were not comparable with earlier statistics the agency had compiled.</p>
        <p>''We just don't have the data to go one way or another,'' said John Willard, a spokesman at the department.</p>
        <p>The world's largest seed companies, which have invested billions of dollars to create genetically altered crops, say the survey largely confirms their own data, which suggests that overall biotechnology acreage has not declined very much.</p>
        <p>''Monsanto's projections continue to show that we expect total acreage to be flat to slightly up,'' said Scarlett Foster, a spokeswoman at Monsanto.</p>
        <p>But critics say that hidden in the Agriculture Department's numbers are hints that after several years of spectacular growth -- biotechnology plantings went from 3 million acres in 1996 to 69 million this year -- the planting of altered crops may be in decline.</p>
        <p>''Even a leveling off shows a level of concern,'' said Charles Margulis, a spokesman at Greenpeace. ''Two years ago the industry said 100 percent of the soybean crop would be genetically engineered by the year 2000 and we're at about half that. And with increasing concern, that could fall even further.''</p>
        <p>Genetically altered crops have become an issue because some environmental activists say the crops are potentially dangerous to humans and the environment.</p>
        <p>American seed companies counter by arguing that the genetically altered crops have been deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration and that the companies have not seen adverse health effects even though they have been in the nation's food supply for several years.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department survey released today seems to contradict a March study that showed farmers intended to plant fewer acres than they did a year ago. But the big seed companies disputed some of those numbers and the department acknowledged that the figures from an earlier study were not entirely comparable.</p>
        <p>According to the survey, 54 percent of the soybeans, 25 percent of the corn and 61 percent of the cotton acreage were planted with genetically altered seeds, which are biologically altered to create their own insecticide or to make the crops immune to chemical spraying that kills weeds.</p>
