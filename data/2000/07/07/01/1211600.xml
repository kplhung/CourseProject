        <p>France's highest administrative court today reversed a decision that had allowed nurses in high school health centers to hand out a ''morning-after pill'' to prevent pregnancies.</p>
        <p>The Council of State overruled a decision made by an education minister last year, saying that the official had misunderstood a 1967 law, which says that hormonal contraceptives may be distributed only under prescription by pharmacies.</p>
        <p>In November, Deputy Education Minister Segolene Royal, a Socialist, told high school health centers to stock the pill, called Norvelo, for circumstances in which doctors could not be reached immediately. That decision made France the first country to allow public school nurses to dispense such post-coital contraception pills. The decision applied to schools that had girls as young as 12. Although nurses were advised to try to inform the child's parents, they were not required to do so.</p>
        <p>The court also said in today's ruling that the pill was in the category of drugs that could present a danger if not used under medical supervision.</p>
        <p>The Norvelo pill can be taken up to three days after sex. It prevents implantation of a fertilized egg, and opponents have called it tantamount to abortion because it keeps an embryo from developing.</p>
        <p>The Catholic Church here strongly opposed Ms. Royal's decision, and the National Confederation of Catholic Family Associations said it ''rejoiced'' at today's ruling but regretted that the court had not gone further to reaffirm parental authority.</p>
        <p>The Voltaire Network, a civil rights group, said it was ''worried about the dramatic consequences of this decision for young women who had no choice but to submit to a pregnancy that was unwanted or even forced.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Royal said today that the government would immediately propose a new law governing contraception.</p>
        <p>When she made her decision, health and education officials said they hoped the policy would reduce unwanted pregnancies and lower the abortion rate, which is higher here than in Germany, Italy or Spain, but lower than that of the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>Yet abortions have failed to decrease despite the easy availability of contraception. French schoolchildren receive little or no sex education, and surveys suggested that they were ill-informed about sex, contraception and abortion. The union of school nurses accepted last year's policy decision eagerly.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the French government allowed pharmacists to sell the pills without a prescription.</p>
