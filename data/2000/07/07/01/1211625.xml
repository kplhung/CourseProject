        <p>Count on Macy's for fireworks this Fourth of July; do not try to set off  your own -- or else, the mayor and other city officials have warned.</p>
        <p>Fireworks, from sparklers to  more elaborate pyrotechnics, are illegal in the city, and the police have been trying to end the tradition of celebrating Independence Day with  noisy, explosive displays by anyone who is not a licensed pyrotechnician.</p>
        <p>''Years ago,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a spokesman for the Police Department, ''you could walk through some neighborhoods, and it would sound like a war zone because of all the firecrackers going off. But it's gotten quieter now.''</p>
        <p>For the last five years, the city's Police and Fire Departments have enforced a zero-tolerance policy on fireworks, and this Fourth of July will be no different, officials said.</p>
        <p>The police said they would arrest anyone peddling, setting off or even carrying fireworks this holiday weekend. They have also been making efforts to stop illegal shipments from coming into the city from New Jersey, Connecticut or upstate New York. About 100 plainclothes officers will be working around the city to make sure that there are no private  displays. ''If you're caught, you will arrested and charged with a felony,'' Lieutenant Biegel said.</p>
        <p>Figures released Thursday by the Police and Fire Departments, officials say, show that the crackdown has discouraged people from bringing fireworks into the city.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the police seized about 24,800 cases of fireworks, compared with 3,600 in 1998 and 1,800 last year. This year, the police have seized about 1,200 cases of fireworks so far. Since 1995, there have been nearly 500 arrests, including 33 this year.</p>
        <p>Officials said they have been motivated by the damage and injuries that fireworks can cause, especially to children. Injuries include severe burns, and the loss of fingers or limbs when fireworks explode prematurely or while they are being lighted.</p>
        <p>''You don't know what that firework is going to do when you light that fuse,'' said David Billig, a Fire Department spokesman. ''Every time you do that, you risk losing a finger or an eye or starting a fire.''</p>
        <p>The number of fireworks-related injuries, the authorities say, has gone down with the increased enforcement efforts. In 1995, there were 56 injuries reported. Last year, the number decreased to 13.</p>
