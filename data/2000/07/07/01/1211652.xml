        <p>John Rocker sat in his specially canopied bullpen, helpless. The bleeding from a callus on his left thumb had stopped, but that was because he was not throwing a baseball.</p>
        <p>He was, instead, watching his fellow Atlanta relievers self-destruct in an improbable eighth inning last night, obliterating the Braves' 8-1 lead with a 10-run disaster. It was an inning pockmarked by four straight walks, six hits, one error and a three-run home run by Mike Piazza that completed the Mets' comeback for an 11-8 victory.</p>
        <p>And Rocker, a focal point of this series because of his disparaging  comments published last winter, could not do a thing about it.</p>
        <p>''I really, literally, felt like I let my team down,'' Rocker said somberly after the game, nursing a thumbnail as black as his mood. He had poured  silver nitrate on his callus, one of three treatments he had tried in the bullpen, but to no avail.</p>
        <p>''It's one open wound,'' he said, describing the injury on his pitching hand.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Rocker sprinted in from the bullpen amid thundering boos and shut down the Mets in a scoreless eighth inning. Even better for the multitude of police officers in the ballpark, there was no violence or vengeance from the crowd.</p>
        <p>Last night, the fans had no chance to react because Rocker did not leave the bullpen. ''It's a situation where we're on the road and I really need to come in to pitch and I can't,'' he said. ''It's not a fun thing.'</p>
        <p>But if Rocker contributed to the loss by not pitching, his fellow relievers caused the damage. It was a combined ineffective effort by the right-handers Don Wengert and Kerry Ligtenberg and the left-hander Terry Mulholland, who was charged with the loss.</p>
        <p>In the eighth inning, Wengert relieved the starter, Kevin Millwood, who had pitched a solid game, giving up only one run and six hits. ''Millwood said he was out of gas,'' the pitching coach, Leo Mazzone, said.</p>
        <p>The Braves did not have many options. The rookie right-hander Jason Marquis pitched two innings on Thursday; Mike Remlinger had just rejoined the team last night after undergoing an M.R.I. on his elbow.</p>
        <p>And Rocker was unavailable, to the surprise of the Mets, who kept looking toward the bullpen in anticipation.</p>
        <p>They did not know that Rocker had informed Mazzone in the third inning that a callus that had bothered him since spring training had split again.</p>
        <p>''I soaked it, iced it, silver-nitrated it,'' Rocker said. ''I tried everything, but it just didn't work out.''</p>
        <p>He tried to make one pitch in the bullpen in the seventh inning, but the callus split open again.</p>
        <p>Wengert allowed four singles, despite getting two outs, and left two men on base for Ligtenberg, who had earned the save Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Ligtenberg walked Benny Agbayani to load the bases. He walked Mark Johnson to bring home a run. Then he walked Melvin Mora to force in another run.</p>
        <p>By that point, the Braves' relievers had thrown more than 60 pitches.</p>
        <p>''It seemed like 170, to be perfectly honest with you,'' Mazzone said. ''You keep thinking when you're sitting there that you're going to make the pitch to get out of it.''</p>
        <p>But that did not happen.</p>
        <p>Mulholland came in to pitch to Derek Bell. He gave up a walk, too.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I made good pitches to Bell,'' said Mulholland, who walked him on a 3-1 count.</p>
        <p>Edgardo Alfonzo then singled through the hole at shortstop to drive in two runs and set up Piazza's three-run shot to left on the first pitch.</p>
        <p>It was one of the worst Mulholland has thrown, he would say later, a cut fastball. ''He did what any good hitter would do with a bad pitch,'' Mulholland said.</p>
        <p>He said he was stunned by his poor outing. ''That's not what you want to have happen,'' Mulholland said. ''You don't want to walk in runs, you don't want to give up home runs.''</p>
        <p>Mulholland was also surprised by the sudden turn of events. ''I never once felt like it was slipping away,'' he said, shrugging. ''Things happen.''</p>
        <p>As for Rocker, his status is still in question. He was unsure, as was Mazzone, after the game. But the pitching coach did not want to risk it in the eighth inning last night. ''Once he's out of the game plan, he's out of the game plan,'' Mazzone said. ''Why ruin it for another week or month or so? That's just common sense.''</p>
        <p>But few in the Braves' locker room could make sense of the eighth.</p>
        <p>''I feel sorry for Kevin Millwood,'' catcher Javy Lopez said. ''He threw an outstanding game. It's horrible to lose a game like that in one inning.</p>
        <p>''It's unbelievable; I've never seen a game like this.''</p>
        <p>And then, quietly, as he was walking from his locker, Lopez mumbled, ''It's embarrassing.''</p>
