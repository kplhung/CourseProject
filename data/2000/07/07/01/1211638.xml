        <p>Maybe the Yankees need more than David Justice, or a couple of pitchers. Maybe what they are missing is more subtle than that.</p>
        <p>There is a dullness to the Yankees these days. They always found a way to win in 1998 and 1999, and now they are giving away games, exuding the energy of flagmen on a highway construction site, hazily guiding opponents to victories.</p>
        <p>After Bernie Williams tied tonight's game against Tampa Bay with a two-run homer in the top of the eighth, Yankee relievers walked four batters in the bottom of the eighth, forcing home two runs in a 6-4 loss to the Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Justice was 0 for 3 in his Yankee debut, reaching base in his first plate appearance on catcher's interference.</p>
        <p>On May 6 the Yankees' record in one-run and two-run decisions was 13-1. They are 7-19 in one-run and two-run games since then.</p>
        <p>''Winning is contagious, and losing is contagious,'' said Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop. ''I don't think anyone here lacks confidence. We're just not getting the breaks we're used to getting.''</p>
        <p>They were in a position to win; they should have won. Jason Grimsley started in spite of an ear infection, and although he surrendered nine hits in two and a third innings before he was relieved -- Grimsley was so sick that he had trouble seeing the ball coming off the bat of hitters -- the Yankees trailed by only 4-2 early. Craig Dingman, promoted to the majors Thursday, shut out the Devil Rays for two and two-third innings.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's Bryan Rekar had a 2-4 record and a 4.80 earned run average before tonight's game, but he stifled the Yankees, who seemed to be overeager against him. Rekar is a sinkerball pitcher and hitters usually try to drive the ball to the opposite field. But of the 19 balls the Yankees put in play against Rekar, 14 were pulled; they kept beating the ball into the ground.</p>
        <p>''We've just got to relax and let the game come to us,'' Justice said later, after pulling three grounders to the right side. ''I didn't let the game come to me.''</p>
        <p>Williams bailed out the Yankees, however, slamming a two-run homer off Jim Mecir (6-1) with two out in the Yankees' eighth. The Yankees have won games like this time and again over the last few years, coming back in the late innings to tie the game, holding opponents with their bullpen and then pushing across the winning run.</p>
        <p>Jeff Nelson relieved in the Tampa Bay eighth, retired the first hitter and got the second hitter, Fred McGriff, to lift a high pop to the left side. Scott Brosius, the third baseman, backpedaled, then held his arms out: he couldn't see the ball. Neither could the shortstop Jeter, and left fielder Shane Spencer could not reach the pop before it fell to the fake grass at Tropicana Field.</p>
        <p>''Once I turned my back -- I don't know if it was the backdrop or the catwalks -- I just couldn't spot it up there,'' Brosius said.</p>
        <p>Nelson walked the next batter, but struck out Jose Guillen. Two outs. He had control of the inning. He fell behind in the count to Mike Difelice, and then disintegrated.</p>
        <p>''Once you get down, two balls and no strikes,'' Nelson said, ''you start pressing, and you start aiming the ball.''</p>
        <p>He walked Difelice, loading the bases. Russ Johnson came to bat. When the game began, he had drawn a total of two walks for the season, but he had three in the first seven innings, and Nelson could not throw strikes. With the fans screaming, Nelson walked Johnson, as well, forcing home the go-ahead run. Nelson snapped at the return throw from the catcher Jorge Posada, as teammates looked on mournfully.</p>
        <p>Nelson fell behind the next batter, Felix Martinez, two balls and no strikes. The Yankees scrambled in their bullpen, rushing to get Todd Erdos warmed up. Nelson appeared frazzled. Posada went to the mound to kill time until Erdos was ready.</p>
        <p>But after Erdos came on, he completed the walk to Martinez -- another run -- and Erdos slammed a fist into his glove. In all, Yankee  pitchers issued 11 walks and allowed 12 hits. The Devil Rays stranded 16 runners, a club record.</p>
        <p>''We gave it away, basically,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ROGER CLEMENS rejoined the Yankees on Friday, preparing for his scheduled start on Sunday. Clemens will be activated from the 15-day disabled list now that his right groin strain seems healed. ''The soreness there is gone,'' Clemens said, ''and the little discoloration that was in there is gone.'' Clemens conceded that he would not truly know that he is fully healed until he gets into a game situation, with his adrenaline pumping and his legs driving his body toward home plate. . . . ORLANDO HERNANDEZ, coming back from an elbow sprain, is scheduled to pitch Saturday . . . JORGE POSADA, still recovering from food poisoning, was back in the lineup Friday night, feeling somewhat haggard. TINO MARTINEZ, who went to dinner with Posada the night Posada became sick, also has not been feeling well.</p>
