        <p>They were teammates years ago in Atlanta, and when David Justice saw Tampa Bay's Fred McGriff across the field during batting practice this afternoon, Justice lifted his new Yankees cap. Check it out, his body language screamed.</p>
        <p>Both men laughed. Justice appeared to be laughing and smiling a lot here, on his first day with the Yankees. ''I was looking at myself just a minute ago and I can't believe I got a Yankees uniform on,'' Justice said. ''It's just amazing to me.''</p>
        <p>Justice was in the starting lineup for tonight's game against the Devil Rays as the designated hitter, batting fifth -- spots he may fill for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>Justice has played the outfield for most of his career, but with Bernie Williams locked into center field and Paul O'Neill set in right field, the only other option would be to use Shane Spencer as the designated hitter and Justice in left.</p>
        <p>But this season Spencer has arguably been the Yankees' best defensive outfielder and has hit much better when he is not used as the D.H. Spencer is batting .233 with 4 homers and 12 runs batted in in 116 at-bats as the D.H., compared with .332 with 5 homers and 27 R.B.I. in 113 at-bats as an outfielder.</p>
        <p>Justice, who is hitting .262 with 21 homers and 58 R.B.I. after going 0 for 3 with a run scored in tonight's 6-4 loss to Tampa Bay, indicated to Manager Joe Torre that he was willing to go along with anything Torre had in mind. ''He's excited to be here,'' Torre said, ''and that makes me happy.''</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez, whose power and run production have greatly diminished this year, was dropped from fifth to seventh in the lineup -- something that Martinez had suggested to Torre. ''This gives us more length in our lineup,'' Torre said, referring to the depth of proven hitters.</p>
        <p>To get Justice, the Yankees swapped outfielder Ricky Ledee and two prospects who will be drawn from a list of eight whom the Yankees and Indians agreed upon.</p>
        <p>Among the prospects most likely on the list, which is made up of pitchers, are the right-handers Brian Reith, Zach Day and Mark Rogers, who are with Class AA Norwich; and Randy Keisler, Jake Westbrook and Ted Lilly, who are in Class AAA.</p>
        <p>Craig Dingman, who was promoted to the majors on Thursday and pitched two and two-thirds scoreless innings in relief tonight, may also be on the list.</p>
        <p>Justice reiterated today that he was shocked by the trade. Summoned into the office of Manager Charlie Manuel of the Indians, Justice said to Manuel: ''O.K., where am I getting traded to? Just joking.''</p>
        <p>But Manuel was not kidding, telling the veteran outfielder he was being dealt to the Yankees. ''To the Yankees?'' Justice replied.</p>
        <p>''I'm like everyone else; we all thought Juan Gonzalez or Sammy Sosa was coming here,'' Justice said. ''I just never thought because of the rivalry between Cleveland and the Yankees that I would ever cross over here to the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Justice probably accelerated his departure by suggesting last week that the Indians' ''window of opportunity'' for winning the World Series might be closing. The Yankees are like the Indians in some respects: aging champions who have struggled this year. Justice was asked how the Yankees and Indians were different.</p>
        <p>''I really haven't been here long enough to really give you a feel for the attitude of the team,'' said Justice, who wore No. 28 tonight. ''That's a question that you might have to ask me in about a month.''</p>
        <p>The acquisition of Justice came after weeks of evaluating and considering a possible deal for Sosa, but now that a big hitter has been added, the Yankees are focusing on adding a pitcher and an established right-handed hitter.</p>
        <p>Like many teams, they have spoken in the last week with Baltimore about Scott Erickson, but it is unlikely the Orioles will deal the right-hander to a division rival.</p>
        <p>The Yankees could try to pry Francisco Cordova or Jose Silva from the Pittsburgh Pirates, or perhaps Omar Olivares from the Oakland Athletics. Olivares has pitched well against the Yankees the last two years.</p>
        <p>The Yankees came close to acquiring the infielder Ed Sprague from San Diego, but the Padres honored Sprague's wish that he be dealt  where he would be assured of playing regularly, and they traded him to Boston for two minor leaguers this afternoon. The Yankees are still discussing the possibility of dealing for the Athletics' John Jaha.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, called Torre this afternoon, talking fast, looking ahead. ''We're trying to help you,'' Steinbrenner told Torre, ''and we'll continue to try to help you.''</p>
