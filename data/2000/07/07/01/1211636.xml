        <p>The Triple Crown may have produced three different winners this year, but the Triple Tiara still offers a historic opportunity for fillies, and, more precisely, for Finder's Fee, who will race six rivals today in the Mother Goose at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Finder's Fee won the Acorn Stakes three weeks ago to establish her presence in the Triple Tiara series for her owner, Ogden Phipps, and her trainer, Shug McGaughey. But they will also be running her stablemate Cat Cay in the Mother Goose The Phipps stable will face major threats from Secret Status, winner of the Kentucky Oaks by 6 lengths; C'est L'Amour, a strong second in the Acorn; and March Magic, who has run first or second in her last six starts.</p>
