        <p>George Orwell was a loser.</p>
        <p>As a friend observes, if Orwell could really see into the future, he would have registered Big Brother as a brand. He would have known that the ominous specter he raised in ''1984'' would, by 2000, become a crowd-pleasing entertainment franchise.</p>
        <p>When ''Big Brother,'' the latest CBS exercise in ''reality'' television, debuts Wednesday night, right after the latest installment of the unstoppable ''Survivor,'' millions of us will delight in spying on 10 Americans trapped in a house for 90 days with two bedrooms, one bathroom, 60 microphones and 28 video cameras. Far from being the triumph of totalitarianism that Orwell brooded about, ''Big Brother'' will be yet another slam-dunk for capitalism. The estate of the man who coined the phrase might have had a cash cow to rival the one that T. S. Eliot's heirs have found in ''Cats.''</p>
        <p>CBS paid some $20 million just to obtain the rights to the ''Big Brother'' TV format from the Dutch entertainment company, Endemol, that originated the show. The network knows it will see a still bigger profit, for in 2000, voyeurism moves the goods. ''Survivor,'' whose sponsors include the U.S. Army (and therefore the U.S. taxpayer), forced ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to flee from a competing time slot and vanquished even the N.B.A. finals in the Nielsens. ''Big Brother,'' which is to air five nights a week (and 24 hours a day on AOL), threatens to bring the country to a standstill. As for those spoilsports who don't want to play Peeping Tom, Leslie Moonves, CBS's president, has politely suggested they just switch channels. And he's right -- this is a free country. It seems downright patriotic that CBS should bring America together in a shared affirmation of our freedom to peep (or not to) on the night after the Fourth of July.</p>
        <p>In Europe, politicians and journalists loudly attacked their local versions of ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' for sadistically turning their players into cutthroat rats in a maze, especially after one castaway voted off the island in the Swedish ''Survivor'' subsequently committed suicide. In America, no one cares how the people on these shows are treated -- the only protest has been from PETA over the ''unethical'' treatment of actual rats, which were eaten on ''Survivor.'' There has also been some grumbling by press watchdogs, including CBS's own Andy Rooney, that the network is blurring the line between news and entertainment by using its morning newscaster as the official voice of Big Brother and by stuffing its news shows with interviews of ''Survivor'' survivees. But it seems laughable to single out CBS when, as Howard Kurtz reported in The Washington Post this week, journalists from his paper, CNN and The Wall Street Journal are leaping to play ''themselves'' in a fictional Showtime movie starring James Garner.</p>
        <p>The truth is that the phenomenal appeal of ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' is the news right now -- perhaps not coincidentally at a time when the shows' promos bleed into amateur videos of real-life wilding in Central Park and Americans are said to be alarmed about Internet invasions of their privacy. We may learn more about the country from these TV series than we will from the political parties' version of ''reality'' television (the infomercial conventions, which will get far less network air time). ''Survivor'' has already held up a mirror to the demographics of American Social Darwinism, 2000: The first 2 of the 16 ''castaways'' voted off the island were two of the oldest. Next to get the boot was another despised species, a lawyer.</p>
        <p>Not that all the news from ''Survivor'' is bad. When Regis's game show briefly ruled, we feared that Americans were driven by greed. Now we learn, with relief, that money isn't everything after all, because it's the desire to be famous, more than the infrequent cash prizes, that are driving thousands to compete to expose themselves on ''Survivor,'' ''Big Brother,'' MTV's ''The Real World'' and the many clones on the way. (NBC may adapt the Dutch ''Chains of Love,'' in which a woman is chained to five men simultaneously.) ''It's basically an audition for fame,'' says John de Mol, the Dutch originator of ''Big Brother.'' Even the losing contestants on ''Survivor'' become talk- and news-show fixtures -- sometimes sharing the spotlight with Darva Conger, whose one-night fling on the scandal-tossed ''Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' has blossomed into a (so far) five-month career as a TV celebrity.</p>
        <p>When I asked Donald Trump if rampant prosperity might have made get-rich-quick game shows pale next to ''Survivor'' in the buzz sweepstakes, he theorized: ''Making money is easier than making fame, so fame might be more desirable -- though I'd still go with the money myself.''</p>
        <p>What's harder to explain is why supposedly privacy-conscious Americans are so eager to audition en  masse for these shows or to gleefully spy on others by watching them. But Jeffrey Rosen, whose new book, ''The Unwanted Gaze,'' is the definitive text on privacy perils in the digital age, feels sanguine about ''Big Brother.'' It's ''silly to huff and puff about wanting to watch lurid television,'' he says. ''It's a human impulse.'' He adds that the exhibitionism of the contestants, even at the price of being humiliated in prime time, is also understandable in the post-Monicagate era. ''Being on TV is now seen as more important than being a good citizen,'' he explains. ''Bill Clinton showed that in a culture of exposure, shamelessness is a self-defense; no amount of bad behavior is embarrassing as long as you continue to be on television. The distinction between fame and infamy has been eradicated.''</p>
        <p>Also eradicated, apparently, is the distinction between reality and unreality. The only viewers who could think ''Survivor'' is real are those who thought ''The Blair Witch Project'' was a documentary. It's every bit as fixed as game shows were in the time of Charles Van Doren. Contrary to the show's opening announcement, no one on screen was ''forced to abandon ship'' or ''marooned''; the participants are volunteers living on what is essentially a movie location, complete with product placement, pseudo-''Lord of the Flies'' makeup and dozens of unseen cameramen and technicians, publicists and prop men (who provide ''Robinson Crusoe''-esque fonts for the parchment island maps). CBS isn't about to let anyone fall ill, break the law or go hungry. Instead of threats from actual natives, the castaways are dogged by canned tribal chants that seem to be piped in from a road company of ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>In other words, ''Survivor'' is for its participants a theme-park experience: an attenuated sleep-over version of Disneyland's Adventureland rides, with actual wildlife instead of audioanimatronics. Watching it on TV is no more partaking of ''reality'' than is watching Hollywood's ''The Perfect Storm.'' Nor is ''Big Brother'' likely to be more real: CBS and AOL promise that we'll see no sex and hear no R-rated words, despite the ubiquity of cameras and mikes in the tiny house (in the wilds of CBS's Studio City lot).</p>
        <p>This would all be harmless were we certain that the line between ''reality television'' and actual reality is universally clear. But TV's exploitation of the Central Park videos of packs of men mauling dozens of women after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade makes one wonder. Though the videos were broadcast over and over for gratuitous titillation long after they ceased to qualify as fresh news, the voyeuristic overkill aroused no more public protest than the prospect of ''Big Brother.'' Nor did many question the ethics of the amateur videomakers, most of whom, says Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan D.A., sold their tapes to news outlets for cash, in a transaction emulating that between ''reality''-TV packagers and the networks. Since in this case, unlike ''Survivor,'' people were actually being hurt, did any of the cameramen at least report the crimes unfolding in their viewfinders? ''Not one of them as far as we know ever called 911 and said you got to do something about this,'' says Mr. Morgenthau.</p>
        <p>Well, times change. When 38 onlookers couldn't be bothered to call the cops as Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death in Queens in 1964, it was a cue for national soul-searching. Now those eyewitnesses would not only escape censure but, if they had a camera handy, could break into the hottest genre in showbiz.</p>
