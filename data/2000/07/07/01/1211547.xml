        <p>The Cuban diaspora in the age of Fidel Castro takes many forms, one of which could be seen and heard at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night. The Miami Symphony Orchestra was founded 11 years ago by Manuel Ochoa, born in Cuba and for many years active in that country's musical life. Most members of his board of directors in Miami are Hispanic, as are many of his players.</p>
        <p>Thursday's program began with evocative pieces by the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera (the Overture to ''The Creole Faust'')  and two 20th-century Spaniards, Joaquin Turina (three ''Danzas Fantasticas'') and Joaquin Rodrigo (the familiar ''Concierto de Aranjuez''). There was Angel Romero to play the Rodrigo's guitar solos, which he did with character and virtuosity. After intermission came Saint-Saens' C minor Symphony with Francisco Muller to blast away at the big organ chords.</p>

        <p>The Cuban diaspora in the age of Fidel Castro takes many forms, one of which could be seen and heard at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night. The Miami Symphony Orchestra was founded 11 years ago by Manuel Ochoa, born in Cuba and for many years active in that country's musical life. Most members of his board of directors in Miami are Hispanic, as are many of his players.</p>
        <p>Thursday's program began with evocative pieces by the Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera (the Overture to ''The Creole Faust'')  and two 20th-century Spaniards, Joaquin Turina (three ''Danzas Fantasticas'') and Joaquin Rodrigo (the familiar ''Concierto de Aranjuez''). There was Angel Romero to play the Rodrigo's guitar solos, which he did with character and virtuosity. After intermission came Saint-Saens' C minor Symphony with Francisco Muller to blast away at the big organ chords.</p>
        <p>It was an evening of intermittent promise and more frequent frustrations. These players have the feel for Turina's gorgeous colors and sensual phrases, but the ear labored unreasonably hard to penetrate the Miami's murky ensemble playing. Ginastera's tight, acerbic style lay largely hidden, and Rodrigo's delicate orchestrations, made to accommodate the guitar's limited carrying power, came out only passably. In general, a lack of integration of what seem to be good musicians is the Miami Symphony's central problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ochoa, who according to the program notes has been conducting for 58 years, brings a lot of experience to his work as well as a founder's dedication. If rhythmically uniform sections plodded, climaxes, ritards and other more conductor-driven passages were well managed. What is not being offered these musicians, for whatever reason, is discipline in a number of categories.</p>
        <p>String sections do not play precisely within themselves and are only shakily together in relation to each other. Tuning in the brass and winds needs a lot of work. (It is uncanny how one can predict good or bad intonation in a performance simply by hearing an orchestra tune to its preconcert A). The result is a kind of indeterminacy, an ensemble haze that exudes a certain warmth but disguises many of the moving parts essential to musical intelligibility.</p>
        <p>The audience was of decent size and enthusiastic, especially for Mr. Romero, who chatted with his listeners and offered an encore. Behind the rough edges of the Miami Symphony are musicianly impulses, and any group that features the wonderful music of Spain and Latin America in its programs deserves support. I hope the city of Miami keeps giving it.</p>
