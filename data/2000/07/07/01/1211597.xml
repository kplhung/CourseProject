        <p>Red Cross officials from North and South Korea signed an agreement today to begin reuniting families separated by more than 50 years of conflict on the Korean peninsula.</p>
        <p>The accord, the first significant step toward achieving goals set at landmark talks between the Koreas two weeks ago, also provides for the return of North Koreans who were imprisoned in the South.</p>
        <p>In the first phase of family reunions, about 100 South Koreans will travel to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, while 100 North Koreans will go to Seoul for four-day meetings with relatives starting Aug. 15, according to South Korean news media reports from North Korea, where the agreement was signed.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the deal is expected to reunite thousands of Koreans who were separated from relatives when the peninsula was divided into the Communist North and capitalist South at the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>South Korean officials estimate that there are nearly eight million people in the South, about 660,000 of them over 60 years old, who have relatives living in the North.</p>
        <p>The Korean War broke out 50 years ago this month, and although a 1953 armistice suspended the fighting, North and South are technically still at war. Only a handful of separated families have been allowed to take part in officially sanctioned reunions in the past.</p>
        <p>''This South-North agreement is the first concrete result following the summit meeting, and it means that we have entered the realization phase in dealing with the separated family issues,'' said Park Ki Ryun, secretary general of the South Korean Red Cross. ''We will try our best to ensure that exchanges will occur without complications.''</p>
        <p>Asked what his expectations for the family reunions were, Choi Seung Chul, the head of North Korea's Red Cross, said, ''Things will work out very well.''</p>
        <p>For family reunions after the first round in August, Red Cross officials agreed to set up a permanent visitation center. The officials said they had not yet decided where to establish this meeting place. However, they mentioned as possible candidates scenic Mount Kumgang, on North Korea's east coast, and Panmunjom, the village in the heavily armed demilitarized zone along the two countries' border.</p>
        <p>The agreement, reached after four days of talks between representatives from the Red Cross of both Koreas at Mount Kumgang, also calls for the return of all North Koreans who served prison terms in the South who want to return home.</p>
        <p>The North Koreans, most of whom were convicted of spying for the North, would be allowed to go in early September. The prisoners were kept in the South Korea for several reasons: most refused to denounce Communism, the two countries were still at war, and the South sought to use them as bargaining chips in negotiations with the North.</p>
        <p>The South Korean Defense Ministry has said that about 50 of the 88 former prisoners, who are mostly elderly, have indicated that they want to return to North Korea.</p>
        <p>There was no mention in the agreement of former South Korean soldiers who may still be imprisoned in the North. The South Korean government says that hundreds of its soldiers taken prisoner during the 1950-53 war are still being held. North Korea has denied this.</p>
        <p>To facilitate meetings between separated family members, North and South Korean officials will trade lists of 200 separated relatives and begin checking to see whether the individuals on the list are still alive.</p>
        <p>The visitation center will not be set up until the North Korean prisoners are returned, the reports said. The center is expected to identify hundreds of separated family members a month and bring them together.</p>
        <p>In recent years, an unofficial trade in family meetings has sprung up in the border region with China, where South Koreans often pay thousands of dollars to handlers who arrange reunions with their family members. Many of the encounters take place on islands in the Yalu River, where Koreans meet long-lost relatives or learn of their deaths.</p>
