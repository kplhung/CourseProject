        <p>More than a year after New York City announced that it would require hundreds of thousands of failing students to attend summer school, preliminary enrollment numbers released by the Board of Education suggest that the program is far less aggressive than had been promised.</p>
        <p>Last spring Rudy Crew, then the schools chancellor, said that by this summer, 362,000 students -- nearly one third of the 1.1 million children in the public school system -- would be forced to attend summer school. To be promoted, the students would be required to take a test at the end of the session, Dr. Crew said, estimating that 88,000 would fail the test and be held back.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Crew's original figure included high school students, and those numbers are not yet available, the total appears to be far lower than expected. The Board of Education is requiring about 63,000 students in elementary and middle school -- or about 8 percent -- to attend summer school starting Wednesday, preliminary statistics show. To be promoted, they will be required to pass a test at the end of summer.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Harold O. Levy said yesterday that there would still be a major commitment to summer school, with more than 100,700 additional students in elementary and middle schools being urged to attend voluntarily. But those students are assured of promotion.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani boasted during his abortive Senate campaign that New York City was ending social promotion, the automatic promotion of students with their age group, even if they are failing. But the latest statistics suggest that teachers used enormous discretion in deciding which students should go to summer school.</p>
        <p>Virtually all students who scored in Level 1, the lowest of four categories, on the citywide reading test given last April are being required to attend summer school, an analysis of the statistics shows. But with students who scored in Level 2 -- which is still below the city's competency standard -- the attendance numbers vary widely from district to district. Overall, the more affluent districts are sending a higher percentage of their weak students to the program, and poorer districts are sending a lower percentage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said that such educational judgment calls were appropriate and were completely in keeping with the plan developed by the Board of Education and Mr. Crew that had the mayor's blessing. Under that plan, teachers may use attendance and classroom work, in addition to standardized test scores, to make promotional decisions.</p>
        <p>''I think it's every bit as rigorous as originally defined,'' Mr. Levy said. ''The rules are exactly the ones Rudy Crew put in place and the mayor endorsed. They haven't changed one iota, and we have put it into place full-bore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy added that under current law, the board cannot compel children to attend summer school, no matter how poor their performance.</p>
        <p>''Until the Legislature makes summer school compulsory, this is all shadow boxing,'' Mr. Levy said. ''What we can do is threaten to hold children back a grade. And for those who are less severely behind grade level, the best we can do is to urge them as a matter of educational judgment to go to summer school.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the Board of Education had difficulty managing summer school. Officials announced that of 35,344 students in third, sixth and eighth grades who were required to go to summer school, 8,800 never showed up, and 8,600 others were assigned to the program by mistake.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Levy has told superintendents to keep track of attendance by entering the figures into a Web site every day. Officials have also been calling students and even visiting their homes to urge them to attend.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy conceded yesterday that the board's data was still not as reliable as he would like. After sending thousands of letters to students encouraging them to go to summer school, he said, he discovered this week that 5,000 of the letters were based on erroneous data and sent to students who had been assured they did not need summer help.</p>
        <p>In January, the Board of Education sent letters to 321,000 students in Grades 3 through 12, warning that they were in danger of being held back. Subsequently officials revised that estimate to say that 250,000 students would be required to go to summer school under threat of being held back.</p>
        <p>The latest numbers are based on records compiled by the board's food and transportation services, and are still being revised, officials said. Still, they give an indication of the summer school picture. Officials estimated yesterday that 100,000 high school students would go to summer school, in addition to the 164,000 in lower grades.</p>
        <p>Ninfa Segarra, Mayor Giuliani's appointee to the Board of Education, said yesterday that she would ask for an analysis of the summer school program, to determine why the number of children required to attend was lower than expected.</p>
        <p>''What happened to all the kids?'' she asked. ''Is it really that they got better, or did they move away and we can't find them? I'm hoping it's an indication that early intervention did work.''</p>
        <p>Officials said that one explanation for the low numbers was that teachers had worked hard to help students improve their performance. Thelma Baxter, superintendent of District 5 in Harlem, said that students at risk of being held back had been given extra classes during vacation, on Saturdays and before and after school. As a result, she said, ''We reduced the number of students required to attend by half.''</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles also played down the lower than expected number of mandatory students, saying the program was still ambitious. ''It's a huge number,'' Mr. Coles said. ''It would make our summer school program the equivalent of one of the largest school districts in the country.''</p>
