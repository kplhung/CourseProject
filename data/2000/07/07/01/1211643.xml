        <p>Bill Guthridge expected to serve another six years as men's basketball coach at the University of North Carolina. But after returning from a European vacation in late May, he found he lacked the appetite for drawing up plays, making appearances and speeches, or spending part of the summer recruiting players.</p>
        <p>The 62-year-old Guthridge announced his retirement today, ending three increasingly stressful years at the helm of one of the most successful programs in modern college basketball.</p>
        <p>''It was a tough decision to make,'' he said, ''but I just ran out of energy.''</p>
        <p>Roy Williams, the University of Kansas coach, appears to be the top candidate to replace Guthridge. ''Hopefully it will be somebody with Carolina connections,'' Guthridge said.</p>
        <p>Williams has a Carolina connection; he was an assistant under Dean Smith until leaving for Kansas in 1988. Williams has agreed to talk to Dick Baddour, North Carolina's athletics director, but said it was ''completely false'' that he had accepted the job. Asked if he had formally been offered the job, he said, ''No.''</p>
        <p>''Basically I've just told them that I would talk to them, and that's it,'' Williams said at a news conference tonight in Lawrence, Kan.</p>
        <p>He said he expected ''that in the next 24 to 48 hours there'll be a definite plan.''</p>
        <p>Guthridge stepped into the job in October 1997 following the abrupt retirement of Smith, who in 36 seasons coached the Tar Heels to 879 victories, most in major-college history, and two national titles. Guthridge, a fellow Kansan, had been Smith's assistant for 30 years.</p>
        <p>''He followed a legend, and he did it with grace and dignity, and athletic and academic success,'' Baddour said of Guthridge.</p>
        <p>Guthridge compiled an 80-28 record and took teams to the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four in 1998 and again last season.</p>
        <p>But there were lowlights as well.</p>
        <p>Rival Duke beat the Tar Heels five straight times the past two seasons, and in 1999 the Heels were upset in the opening round of the N.C.A.A. tournament by Weber State.</p>
        <p>An 18-13 record following the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament ensured the most losses at the school since 1952, spurring unaccustomed speculation that the Tar Heels might be excluded from the N.C.A.A. tournament.</p>
        <p>Criticism of Guthridge grew feverish, though he shrugged it off with characteristic equanimity and dry wit.</p>
        <p>Then the team ran off four straight victories to reach the Final Four, where it lost in the semifinals to Florida, 71-59.</p>
        <p>Guthridge insisted last year's grind did not factor into his decision. ''I think all coaches are stressed at the end of the year,'' he said. ''We had a lot of ups. We had some downs.''</p>
        <p>Glancing at Smith, who did not attend Carolina games after he retired, Guthridge added with a laugh, ''I do intend to come to the games.''</p>
        <p>Like Smith, Guthridge left his successor plenty to work with. Next season's Tar Heels are expected to be a top 10 team. They return four starters, including center Brendan Haywood and guard Joseph Forte.</p>
