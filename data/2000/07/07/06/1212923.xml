        <p>LAPOVSKY-Arthur Joseph, M.D. Died peacefully in Columbia, MD on July 5, 2000 at the age of 95. A long time resident of Brooklyn, NY he was Clinical Professor of Neurology Emeritus at the State University of New York Health Science Center at Bklyn and beloved husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother and friend. A renowned diagnostician and devoted teacher. He received his M.D. from the Long Island College Hospital and was certified in internal medicine, neurology and psychiatry. He was an integral part of the Department of Neurology at SUNY/HSCB and its residency training program for more than a half-century. He also served as attending neurologist at most major hospitals in Brooklyn and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Brooklyn Neurological Society, serving as its president, in 1940 and 1948. His major area of interest was movement disorders and he pioneered the use of dopamine for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. He was a World War II veteran and held the ranks of Captain and Major in the U.S. Army Medical Corp. He and his wife, the late Martha Schulman Lapovsky, were lovers of the arts with an intense interest in classical music. They supported the major cultural institutions in New York. As passionate travelers they visited many remote places before world travel became easily accessible. He is survived by a son, David Lapovsky; two daughters, Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Ruth Kasle; five grandchildren, Peter and Steen Strand and Jenni, Courtenay and Matt Lapovsky; two great-grandchildren, Will and Maren Strand and a sister, Shirley Schiffrin.
