        <p>''How many ballet companies today are headed by a woman?'' Twyla Tharp asked over a bitter cup of coffee. The answer is less than a handful (usually abroad), and the question is more than rhetorical, whatever it implies about a macho plot.</p>
        <p>More simply, it is Ms. Tharp's preface to explaining why she is starting a new dance company -- which has its debut tonight at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C. -- after 12 years of freelancing. Although most of the works she choreographed in that period were for American Ballet Theater and other major classical companies in the United States and Europe, she has no ballet company to call home.</p>
        <p>''I need to be grounded again in my own company,'' Ms. Tharp said during several conversations in New York recently. ''These have been 12 years of exile.''</p>
        <p>The fact that she chose to dissolve the modern-dance troupe she founded in 1965 because of financial and administrative burdens now seems beside the point. At 58, Ms. Tharp retains the spunk and energy familiar to those who knew her work at its bold and innovative beginnings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp was part of the modern-dance experiments of the 1960's. Robert Joffrey sensed her wide appeal. ''Deuce Coupe,'' her 1973 hit for the Joffrey Ballet, impelled her toward the blend of ballet and modern dance she has since used in ballet companies throughout the world.</p>
        <p>No one questions her status as a major choreographer in the 21st century. But more than anyone, she epitomizes a highly original artist attempting to work within the confines of large arts institutions, and the frustrations that can entail.</p>
        <p>Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, companies for which she recently choreographed two premieres, were once small creative troupes with a family atmosphere. And as Ms. Tharp found out, exercising control over your own dance company is very different from sharing dancers and limited rehearsals in ballet companies with some 40 works to prepare.</p>
        <p>''It has been 12 years since I've had a full dress and technical rehearsal,'' Ms. Tharp said, referring to the stage time provided in advance by the American Dance Festival for her company, Twyla Tharp Dance. The program of two Tharp premieres, ''Surfer at the River Styx'' and ''Mozart Clarinet Quintet K. 581,'' will be performed through Saturday at Duke University.</p>
        <p>Although manifestly confident of her use of the ballet idiom, Ms. Tharp has essentially retained the mind-set of a modern dancer. That is, she sees movement as something to be explored and does not regard the 350-year-old ballet idiom as a given, a vocabulary sufficient unto itself.</p>
        <p>For her new troupe, Ms. Tharp has some surprises up her sleeve. The six dancers she has hired as the ''seedling'' of a new company might eventually be part of a larger company that performs modern-dance classics, not just her own work.</p>
        <p>''I'm founding the company so that the focus now will be on my work,'' she said. ''But I am interested in an American repertory company. It would provide a foundation for 20th-century works to be grounded as other works are in the ballet companies. Do I see this as a priority? No. Do I see this as a responsibility? Yes, I do.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the work of modern-dance pioneers that would be included in this eclectic company, Ms. Tharp's choreography has explored a hybrid style of both ballet and modern dance.</p>
        <p>While she often contrasted ballet and modern dance idioms within a single work, she is now less interested in what she calls ''collisions'' of idioms than in unifying them. Many of her pieces have divided a cast into two units: classical dancers (on toe) and less classical dancers (in sneakers).</p>
        <p>But this was not true of ''The Beethoven Seventh,'' the premiere in which she used the composer's Seventh Symphony for the New York City Ballet last winter. Nor was it true of ''Brahms-Haydn Variations,'' presented this spring as the 15th work Ms. Tharp has created for Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Tharp has shifted some of her thinking about choreography, she said that this was not true of her thinking on how music serves dance. Some City Ballet dancers were startled when she began with one piece of music and then substituted another score by the end. This is a practice, designed to avoid illustration of the music, that is common to modern dance but not to the ballet world.</p>
        <p>In ''Push Comes to Shove'' in 1976, Ms. Tharp's first work for Ballet Theater, she started with Bach for Mikhail Baryshnikov's role. ''Misha is a rococo dancer,'' she said, explaining why she switched to ragtime.</p>
        <p>The coexistence of ballet and modern dance is also reflected in the kind of dancers in Ms. Tharp's new group. Andrew Asnes and Francie Huber are modern dancers who were members of the Paul Taylor Dance Company. The other four are ballet dancers: Elizabeth Parkinson was in the Joffrey Ballet and has been a soloist in the Broadway show ''Fosse.'' Benjamin Bowman was in the New York City Ballet. Ashley Tuttle, Keith Roberts and John Selya appeared often in Tharp works at Ballet Theater (Ms. Tuttle returns there in August).</p>
        <p>The troupe will perform at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington from Sept. 29 through Oct. 1. A new company does not preclude other ventures for Ms. Tharp. One is a possible adaptation of stories by Maurice Sendak. Ms. Tharp declined to say which but offered assurances that she would have things go bump in the night. ''It wouldn't be any fun if it weren't scary,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp added that she planned to keep choreographing single works for ballet companies when asked. Among others, the Bolshoi Ballet and the Kirov Ballet have put out feelers.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Ms. Tharp has worked on a project-by-project basis, both in ballet companies and with temporary groups of dancers. Some of these core dancers, like Stacy Caddell, are also the dancers on which she first tries out choreography in the studio.</p>
        <p>Yet after giving up her permanent company in 1988, Ms. Tharp has often made it harder to keep up with her work. Often commissioned by producers scattered around the world, many of her premieres of the last three years have not been seen  in New York.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Worldly-Wise,'' a full-length piece inspired by the life of Rossini that she did for the Royal Ballet in London in 1997, has not been performed here. Nor have the works that started her Beethoven cycle. ''Grosse Sonate'' was danced by the pick-up group she called Tharp! at the American Dance Festival last summer. ''Diabelli Variations'' received raves last year in London and at Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa.</p>
        <p>These pieces led into ''The Beethoven Seventh'' at City Ballet. Ms. Tharp said she embarked on this cycle for two reasons. ''I wanted to examine the Romantic material because I find the aesthetics of the 20th century hopelessly barren,'' she said. ''So I'm going back to early Romanticism, to what was overreacted to.'' The second reason was her interest in ''how Beethoven kept faith with his craft and art as he lost his instrument,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Referring to Beethoven's deafness, she acknowledged that she no longer dances as before despite a daily visit to the gym. ''I'm losing my primary instrument as a dancer,'' she remarked. ''And when that is lost, you either have to find a new way or stop. I was not interested in stopping. I was interested in how Beethoven did it. He was a virtuoso at the piano, and although he couldn't hear the music, he was unbelievably physical in his conducting. Movement precedes music. And his moving through daily life motivated the music.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Tharp began choreographing the ''Beethoven Seventh''  for City Ballet, she originally used some of Beethoven's bagatelles and sonatas. The choreography now danced to the Seventh Symphony's second movement by Wendy Whelan and Nikolaj Hubbe was originally created to a sonata. Ms. Tharp explained: ''I looked at it, put the choreography to the symphony's second movement, and I said, 'Holy Toledo, Beethoven's meter, cycles and thinking were exactly the same in both.' ''</p>
        <p>Some observers found that Ms. Tharp had ignored Beethoven. She noted that ''my approach to music is different in each piece,'' but in this case she had a purpose. ''The music is too familiar,'' she said. ''You cannot let the dancers into the material frontally. They would have backed off into clicheland. It would have looked too square. I went through the back door and got intricacy.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I will parallel the music with the choreography, as in 'Brahms-Haydn.' But music can be an energy-driving source, like gasoline in a car. We don't need to illustrate music, music illustrates itself.</p>
        <p>''I feel the same about narrative in dance. The content and thematic materials of dance is of itself, like boxing. You play tennis and baseball. But boxing is not a sport you play: you stand up and do it.''</p>
