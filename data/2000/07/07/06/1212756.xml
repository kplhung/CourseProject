        <p>One of the world's great players and writers died in February at the age of 89. Bruce Bell was the Grand Old Man of bridge in New Zealand, and he was one of five people who have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for services to bridge, becoming an Officer of the British Empire in 1979.

        <p>As a bidder, Bell had one quirk. He believed that virtually any four-club bid in a constructive auction should be an ace-inquiry. As a player, he was sometimes brilliant, as the diagramed deal, played long ago, demonstrates. He sat South, and reached six hearts as shown. He correctly decided that his partner's unexpected raise to five hearts must be based on possession of three strong trumps.</p>

        <p>One of the world's great players and writers died in February at the age of 89. Bruce Bell was the Grand Old Man of bridge in New Zealand, and he was one of five people who have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for services to bridge, becoming an Officer of the British Empire in 1979. The others are Rixi Markus of England and Keith McNeil of Australia, both deceased, Tim Seres of Australia and Nicola Gardener Smith of England.</p>
        <p>As a bidder, Bell had one quirk. He believed that virtually any four-club bid in a constructive auction should be an ace-inquiry. As a player, he was sometimes brilliant, as the diagramed deal, played long ago, demonstrates. He sat South, and reached six hearts as shown. He correctly decided that his partner's unexpected raise to five hearts must be based on possession of three strong trumps.</p>
        <p>The bidding indicated that South would need ruffs, so West could and should have led a trump. But he chose the routine diamond king. Even looking at all four hands, it is not obvious that the slam can now be made.</p>
        <p>Bell ruffed in his hand, leaving the diamond ace in the dummy. He then crossed to the heart queen and ruffed another diamond. A second heart to the king permitted him to ruff a third diamond with his last trump.</p>
        <p>Dummy was entered by overtaking the club jack with the queen, and this was position:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>Bell played the heart ace, throwing the club ace, and the diamond ace, throwing the club king. He could then cash three club winners, and had the spade ace as his 12th trick. West was left to discover that a trump lead or a club lead would have removed a vital entry from the dummy prematurely, preventing Bell's elegant dummy reversal and unblock maneuver.</p>
