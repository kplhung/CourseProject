        <p>It is the forbidden subject in Cambodia, but people cannot stop talking about it: who will eventually succeed King Norodom Sihanouk, the ailing and increasingly reclusive man who is the soul of his country?</p>
        <p>Seeming to grow tinier and tinier with every public appearance, constantly complaining about his ill health and general discouragement but still bowing and smiling with the dazzling charm of old, the king is the living symbol of a nation that has survived generations of anguish.</p>
        <p>To many, he seems irreplaceable. His fortunes and his antics run through the past half-century of Cambodia like the sharp red line on a graph, jiggering up and down but continuing, unbroken, as the country's historical constant.</p>
        <p>But as he constantly warns his countrymen, the king is 77 years old and weakened by an array of ailments, from strokes to cataracts to diabetes to prostate cancer. His life, he said last year, has reached ''a period that is similar to the setting of the sun.''</p>
        <p>And so, behind the scenes, the maneuvering is well under way, masked by a political taboo on public talk of succession. When one politician, Sam Rainsy, called for clarification earlier this year, he was angrily shushed by people who have a stake in the outcome and in keeping the maneuvering quiet.</p>
        <p>For onlookers, it has become almost a national sport to riffle through the apparent heirs like a pack of cards filled with jacks and jokers as well as potential kings. There is even, if the Constitution is amended to allow it, a potential queen.</p>
        <p>Cambodia's 1993 Constitution is not much help in this game. Thousands of people are theoretically eligible, as male descendants of King Ang Eng, who died in 1797. Among these, half a dozen are in serious contention: the sons and half brothers of King Sihanouk. And the king's wife is another contender.</p>
        <p>The choice is to be made after he dies by a nine-member Crown Council whose makeup is dominated by supporters of the man who would be kingmaker, Prime Minister Hun Sen.</p>
        <p>And it is widely believed that Mr. Hun Sen's chief priority -- like that of the badly mistaken French colonial rulers who selected the current king in 1941 -- is to find someone who will not offer a political challenge.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the constitutional monarch of today's Cambodia is mostly a figurehead with little real power. King Sihanouk's influence comes from the force of his personality.</p>
        <p>''Sihanouk is already part of history, so when he disappears it will represent not only an important event but will create a kind of vacuum,'' said Raul M. Jennar, a Belgian expert on Cambodia. ''And I don't think any successor will be able to take his place.''</p>
        <p>A dramatist not only in his films and songs but in his life, he managed to keep his country intact and at peace while breaking from the French in 1953. He abdicated and took the title prince in 1955 to become directly involved in politics. He maintained Cambodia's neutrality as the Indochina war grew. When he was ousted in an American-sponsored coup in 1970, he backed the Communist Khmer Rouge, to disastrous effect, becoming their prisoner when they took power in 1975.</p>
        <p>After the election of 1993 he resumed the title king and supported an awkward coalition government, apparently hoping to wield decisive influence as the throne behind the power. But as Mr. Hun Sen bludgeoned his way to undisputed leadership, the king seemed to give up, making statements like, ''If the ones who have power in their hands do not listen to me, I cannot achieve anything useful.''</p>
        <p>Or, in 1997: ''I also want to abdicate. But after weighing the pros and cons several nights, I've decided to remain king awhile yet.''</p>
        <p>For most Cambodians, particularly those who remember what they think of as a ''golden age'' before the 1970's, King Sihanouk is the embodiment of a lost grandeur, perhaps the last of the great ''god-kings.''</p>
        <p>To the outside world, quirky and colorful, he has risen above his title to a place as one of the great personalities of his time.</p>
        <p>''He is unique -- one of the most intelligent men I have met in the country, but it is all by instinct, unstructured and astute,'' said Olivier de Bernon, a French historian with the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient. ''He is a king, like Louis XIV. There is no way to understand him except by being a king yourself.''</p>
        <p>And those clamoring to succeed him, it seems, are mere mortals.</p>
        <p>Most prominent is Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 56, a man with an unnerving physical resemblance to his father but with a political haplessness that seems to exasperate the king.</p>
        <p>Ousted by Mr. Hun Sen as his co-prime minister in a coup three years ago, he has retreated to the pomp and sinecure of speaker of the National Assembly and head of the defeated royalist party. So people ask, what else was he promised for his tameness, the future kingship? And if so, what is the value of a promise?</p>
        <p>Political analysts who consider themselves to be cannier point to Prince Norodom Sihamoni, 47, a former ballet dancer who lives in Paris, is a cultural representative for the United Nations and plays little public role in Cambodia. Unlike the other contenders, he is the son of the king's current, and fifth, wife, and is said enjoy his parents' support.</p>
        <p>A close adviser to Mr. Hun Sen  said the question of succession would be the prime minister's next ''top priority'' and suggested that Prince Sihamoni was the most likely heir. But it is the prime minister's style to divide and confuse; the question seems far from decided.</p>
        <p>The king's half brother, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, 49, a former foreign minister, is also in contention, although he too has crossed swords with Mr. Hun Sen. In 1995 the prime minister accused Prince Sirivudh of plotting to kill him, and the prince spent four years in exile before returning last year.</p>
        <p>Apart from King Sihanouk, the only other personality whose portrait can be found in every corner of the country is his wife, Queen Monineath, who is half-French and has Cambodianized her name in recent years from Monique.</p>
        <p>The king has spoken of her as a potential successor and has elevated her title to royal supreme wife, from royal wife. But there have been no moves to amend the Constitution to allow a woman to reign.</p>
        <p>As the king lives out what seems a rather lonely sunset, she is his closest companion as he travels between his Phnom Penh palace -- no longer the social and diplomatic center it once was -- and a guest house in Beijing, where he retreats for much of the year to rest and receive medical care.</p>
        <p>His increasing absences do seem to trouble his subjects.</p>
        <p>''I am old now, 68 years old, so I am very familiar with our dear king,'' said a human rights worker who refused to allow his name to be used. ''I feel he has become not the king of Cambodia but the king of a Chinese city.''</p>
        <p>More plaintively, Mom Muong, who works in a photocopy shop, said: ''We feel he is our father, and when our father is away, we feel very sad. We feel small, small, small, small.''</p>
        <p>Attitudes like this only seem to feed the discouragement that appears to have infused the final chapter in King Sihanouk's reign.</p>
        <p>''They continue to believe that I am a god-king, like the kings of Angkor,'' he said after handing out tiny gifts to a throng of poor villagers three years ago. ''Unfortunately I am not a god. I am a human being.''</p>
