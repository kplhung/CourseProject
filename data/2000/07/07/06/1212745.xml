        <p>SO, an economist, a magician and a man with attention deficit disorder are sitting in a hotel room.</p>
        <p>That's not the setup for a joke, it's simply one of the many encounters that took place here in June at a weekend meeting of about 70 people with diverse professions, hobbies and afflictions who attended a two-day conference to commune, confess and complain about the one thing they had in common: their roles as the remote work force of the Web site About.com.</p>
        <p>A microcosm of the Web itself, About.com is a linked network of 700 Web sites. The conference was a regional one in a series of intimate gatherings sponsored by the company and designed to focus on the basics of the Web business. Taken together, the topic array was dizzying -- space, social work, TV for Teens, composite materials (the stuff used to make rocket ships). The content on each site is created by people, who may or may not be professionals in the fields they cover and who are not employees of About.com.</p>
        <p>Called guides by the company, the Webmasters are independent contractors who have set up their soapboxes under the company umbrella. They are there because About.com offers something other sites do not: the chance for the so-called experts, professionals and hobbyists to make money pursuing their passions. Sometimes, a great deal of money.</p>
        <p>For their efforts, Webmasters earn a minimum of $500 a month as a fee against advertising revenue.</p>
        <p>''We see a continuum, guides who don't care about the money, and guides, like our stocks guide, for who it's all about the money,'' said Scott Kurnit, the chief executive who founded the company in 1996 as The Mining Company, changing the name shortly after it went public. ''It's a continuum of passion to greed.''</p>
        <p>Bill Burton, the casino gambling guide, simply loves what he calls, ''the game.'' He said he funnels every cent he makes from his Web work back into buying books and videos about gambling, or he uses it as travel fare to the casinos he visits once a week. Gambling money comes out of a separate for-gambling bank account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton, 48, of New Britain, Conn., who holds a day job as a printer, spent the  weekend handing out little rubber brains.  ''This is the true secret of winning at the casino, your brains,'' he said, pulling one of the brains out of his pocket.</p>
        <p>He said he had planned to build his own Web site, ''The Casino College of Knowledge,'' then he heard about About.com and set up shop with them. He echoed the sentiments of many other guides who believe they are making more money with About.com than they would be if they were floating alone on the Web.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Burton, most guides run their Web sites as a sideline, working an average of 10 to 15 hours a week. They write original articles, scour the Web for the best links to their topic, are hosts to live chats, manage forums and publish their own newsletters.</p>
        <p>Along with knowledge about their topics, guides must be dexterous in the use of HTML, adept at self-promotion and must possess a stick-to-itiveness that keeps their sites going. Most guides said they had started just because they wanted to share what they knew with others. Many admitted they always had a secret desire to write.</p>
        <p>Applicants usually come in over the Internet transom by clicking on the ''be a guide'' button on About.com's home page. Only 20 percent of people who go through the selection process get the job, Mr. Kurnit said. To make the grade, a prospective guide must write an article, create a list of links to a topic and send in a resume.</p>
        <p>Once approved, an applicant enters a training program. The first step is to build a Web site on speculation within 10 days. The site must include another article and at least 60 links to other sites on their topic on the Web. Then the prospective guides spend another 12 weeks working with About.com editors to flesh out their sites.</p>
        <p>What becomes clear during the 16-week evaluation, said Jim Scollins, vice president for guide operations, is whether applicants really know what they are talking about.</p>
        <p>Evaluations depend on the site.</p>
        <p>''What's credible and what's an expert depends on the topic,'' Mr. Scollins said. ''If you're talking about heart disease, we need to have a doctor. With talk television, it's going to be more of a fan site. We're not going to let someone who's had a couple of nose jobs run the plastic surgery site.''</p>
        <p>But not all Webmasters for health-related topics are doctors. Some, like the thyroid site Webmaster, have written books on the topic. Others, like the lupus site Webmaster, may suffer from an affliction and then build an online community around it.</p>
        <p>Having nonprofessionals run some of the sites is what makes About.com accessible to its users, say the professionals who have their own Web sites. ''We would not be as strong a site if we were all professionals,'' said Leonard Holmes, a clinical psychologist who runs the mental health site. An anesthesiologist and an orthopedic surgery resident work as guides, and the economist guide, John Irons, is a professor of economics at Amherst College, but there is also Rachel Thomas who runs the TV for Teens site.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Thomas, a homemaker from Marshalls Creek, Pa., with two young children and two teenage stepchildren, said she watches a lot of television. But TV for Teens was not her first choice. She said she wanted to be the guide for the soap opera, ''One Life to Live,'' but another woman got the job.</p>
        <p>''When her site went live,'' Mrs. Thomas said, ''I realized they really did choose the right person for this topic, and I realized that she was good.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mrs. Thomas said, she works 35 hours a week on her site, and has netted $500 to $1,200 a month. ''It's worth it,'' she said. ''I get to work in my pajamas and raise my children, which is the most important part of this job.''</p>
        <p>And although making extra cash for watching television is a neat trick, a few Webmasters are successful enough to have given up their day jobs for a full-time career as a guide. The pregnancy site Webmaster, Robin Elise Weiss -- a childbirth educator, a doula trained to assist women after childbirth, and a mother of three who is pregnant with her fourth child -- earns $15,000 a month from her Web work. She is being touted as a poster child for the company.</p>
        <p>The secret to her success? ''Well,'' she said, ''a lot of people get pregnant.'' Mrs. Weiss, who lives in Louisville, Ky., also said that the human touch was important. She  answers all her e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>''I have a mom who's been writing to me for four years,'' Mrs. Weiss said. ''She's on her 11th baby, and she told me you've kept pregnancy interesting to me.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weiss admits that she has a type A personality. And a driven personality is common among the guides, whose earnings are based on the number of unique hits each site receives.</p>
        <p>About.com had 19 million users last month, said Mark Josephson, a company vice president. According to Media Metrix, a company that tracks Web site popularity, the site is the seventh largest on the Internet. Ninety-five percent of visitors enter the site through search engines that send them directly to topic-specific sites, bypassing the home page. The guides are responsible for getting their sites listed on search engines.</p>
        <p>The company provides the business overlay: Web page templates, marketing, public relations, advertising sales and an editorial staff of 30 people. It also picks up the tab for regional conferences for the guides like the one in Washington. The conferences make these disparate people feel like they belong.</p>
        <p>''You get paranoid when you're working 2,000 miles from headquarters and you've never met the guy you're working for,'' said Mr. Kurnit, describing the typical guide-to-company relationship. ''We own the sites,'' he said. ''We control the intellectual property in perpetuity. That requires a tremendous amount of trust from the guides.''</p>
        <p>Though overwhelmingly white, the guides are a disparate group with seemingly little to bind them. ''I look around and think, 'I wouldn't be your friend if I had met you on the street,' '' Mrs. Weiss said of her fellow conference attendees. She reflected that they had found a common bond through the Web site.</p>
        <p>Deep into breakout sessions, the guides were speaking their weird universal language, which includes words like ''sprinks'' (sponsored links), ''mbodies'' (their home pages) and ''blindexes'' (a list of links to more links). Finally, they got into it. ''We need an obsessive compulsive site,'' said Bob Seay, the attention deficit disorder guide.</p>
        <p>''All our sites are,'' said the senior editor, Ms. Osborne, causing a burst of laughter.</p>
        <p>The sites are also geared to the average person, which, it seems, is what About.com is all about: getting to ''the average person.''</p>
        <p>Bryan Dean, a magician from Valley Forge, Pa., who runs the magic and illusion site, confessed that when he started, he wanted to be ''the magician's magician.'' But after attending a guide conference in Tarrytown, N.Y., and hearing about an enduringly popular quilting site that used a very basic approach, he had an epiphany: he decided to dumb down his magic site.</p>
        <p>''I went from advanced to beginner and intermediate,'' Mr. Dean said. ''The numbers went through the roof. They doubled almost overnight.''</p>
        <p>David Dunbar, a lawyer from Ottawa who runs the chess site, had a similar experience. After his site had been online for a year, it finally occurred to him to post the rules of the game. His numbers surged.</p>
        <p>''What took me so long?'' he said, and reflected that his Web site was like the ''chocolate bar'' of chess. Unlike the grandmaster sites, filled with page after page of chess analysis, his site is easier to consume, and not too heavy.</p>
