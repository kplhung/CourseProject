        <p>FRANCE: U.S. ESPIONAGE INQUIRY  The European Parliament in Strasbourg has voted to form a committee to investigate allegations that Washington's vast surveillance system, called Echelon, is being used to conduct industrial espionage now that the cold war is over. The system, maintained by the United States and several allies including Britain, listens to and watches millions of telephone, fax and e-mail messages each day. The committee is expected to report back in about eight months.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: MAYOR'S NEW PROBLEMS  Jean Tiberi,  the Mayor of Paris, has received some more bad news: A court is investigating his wife, Xaviere, for taking part in a vote-rigging scheme. Mr. Tiberi would like to run for mayor again in 2001, but his party has chosen someone else. Polls show fewer than 10 percent of Parisians believe Mr. Tiberi is honest. His wife's latest predicament is only the latest in a long line of investigations surrounding Mr. Tiberi, once a close ally of President Jacques Chirac.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: EUROPEAN WARNING  Trying to veto any expansion of the European Union will backfire against Austria, a spokesman for the European Union said. The spokesman was responding to remarks by Austrian political leaders saying they might hold up expansion plans if the union does not end sanctions imposed after the rightist Freedom Party was allowed in government.</p>
        <p>Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: DENIAL BY MAYOR OF MOSCOW  Yuri M. Luzhkov, the brash and ambitious mayor of Moscow, heatedly denied a report in the newspaper Kommersant that he had agreed to resign under pressure from officials at the Kremlin, perhaps in exchange for a guarantee he would not be prosecuted for undisclosed offenses. Mr. Luzhkov, like all leaders of Russian regions, would lose immunity from prosecution should President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to restructure the nation's Parliament succeed, as now appears likely.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: MILOSEVIC MOVE  Parliament met to discuss constitutional changes that could allow President Slobodan Milosevic to win a new term as federal president, but through direct election, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under current law, Mr. Milosevic was elected by Parliament for a single four-year term, which runs out next year. He has already served two terms as Serbian president. Mr. Milosevic is deeply unpopular, however, and there is no guarantee that he would win.</p>

        <p>CHILE: PINOCHET APPEAL  The Supreme Court will begin to hear an appeal next Wednesday against the revocation of Augusto Pinochet's immunity, which could lead to the former dictator's being tried on human rights charges. The date was pushed back a week at the request of Mr. Pinochet's lawyers. In June, a Santiago appeals court that had been asked to decide whether to strip Mr. Pinochet, 83, of the immunity he holds as a senator confirmed reports that it voted 13-9 for revocation.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: BOMB REMOVED  An unexploded bomb was removed from the office of the attorney general a day after a small explosion in a toilet in the building. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman called the explosion a ''terror tactic.'' It occurred one hour after prosecutors finished questioning a son of former President Suharto in connection with a corruption case against Mr. Suharto.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: NEW MALUKU DEATHS  Fighting between Christians and Muslims continued to range in the Maluku islands despite a nine-day-old state of emergency. As many as 14 people have been killed in the past two days and the region's biggest college, Pattimura University, was reported to have been burned to the ground.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: IMMUNITY REMOVED  A parliamentary committee voted to revoke the immunity of a former Cabinet minister accused by three women of sexual assault and harassment. At the attorney general's request, the House Committee voted to remove the parliamentary immunity of former Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, 55. He resigned on May 28, after Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein announced criminal charges would be brought against him.</p>

        <p>CONGO: WARRANT FOR AIDE  Belgium has issued  an international arrest warrant for Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia of Congo on charges including inciting racial hatred, prosecutors said. Belgium officials have begun contacting Interpol and other major international police bodies for help in carrying out the warrant, related to the killing of ethnic Tutsi in Congo in 1998, the prosecutors said. Mr. Yerodia's reported remarks were made soon after rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda invaded Congo, when Mr. Yerodia headed the cabinet of President Laurent Kabila.</p>

        <p>KENYA: 'DESPERATE' DROUGHT  The effects of a regional drought are becoming ''desperate,'' a United Nations official said, in asking rich nations to donate $88 million to feed 3.3 million Kenyans through the end of the year. Many rich nations have been reluctant to give to Kenya, hard hit by drought, because so much food meant for starving people is being stolen by corrupt local officials. David Fletcher, of the World Food Program, stressed that a new system was in place to cut down on corruption.</p>

        <p>IVORY COAST: MUTINEERS APPEASED  The military government succeeded in appeasing mutinous soldiers who had invaded downtown Abidjan in a protest over pay. After meeting with the president, Gen. Robert Guei, a group of soldiers appeared on television with government officials to say they had agreed to return to the barracks, though neither side issued details of concessions to the soldiers.</p>
