        <p>HER name is Maria, she is 28, she has three children, 3, 6 and 8, no husband -- and this is where the stereotype ends. She's a full-time receptionist for a communications company, has worked for more than three years and has every intention of continuing to make her way in life without welfare.</p>
        <p>But the government could undermine her resolve.</p>
        <p>In April, Maria lost the subsidy that helped her pay for child care, under a program for working parents. She lost the money because she earns too much. The city told her that her salary of $2,666 a month ($31,992 a year) was $29 more a month than the regulations allowed.</p>
        <p>A rule is a rule, right? Except the city, which is supposed to update the income ceilings for child care subsidies once a year to reflect changes in the cost of living, has not done so since 1990. And while its ceilings are generous, working parents are starting to feel the financial pressure.</p>
        <p>Since January, the city has deemed 347 families ineligible for financial help. The subsidies will be restored in 88 of the 347 cases, said Jack Deacy, communications director for the Administration for Children's Services.</p>
        <p>So the numbers of those hurt represent only a small fraction of the 39,000 parents who get subsidized child care in New York City. But children's advocates say that the impact is larger than the numbers imply. Many parents, who have to have their eligibility reviewed yearly, are being told at their recertification interviews that they no longer qualify for financial help. And the impact on those who lose financing, or fear they will, can be disruptive.</p>
        <p>Some, like Maria, are scrambling to find alternative care for their children without jeopardizing their jobs. Still others on waiting lists are being told that they are ineligible for the program, which is financed through federal block grants and city funds. Parents contribute to their children's care based on their income.</p>
        <p>''I have a number of families on the over-income waiting list who are not really over income,'' said Deborah Carroll, a coordinator for Youth and Family Services at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House. ''But you cannot take on new families that aren't eligible. It's very arbitrary.''</p>
        <p>If the income ceilings had been raised, Maria could earn $38,363 and still qualify for the program, according to the Welfare Reform Network, a welfare advocacy group. Maria, who insisted that her last name not be printed, was contributing $67 a week for the care of her children until the last week in April. Now the same care is costing $225 a week -- $175 from Maria, $50 from her mother.</p>
        <p>Amma Appiah, an office manager with a nonprofit education organization, has been waiting since March to find out if she will lose financial help for her 6-year-old son. The city told her then that she earned $100 a month too much for the program. She is appealing.</p>
        <p>MS. APPIAH, 25, now contributes $5 a week toward her son's care. She can afford more, she said -- but not the full cost of $240 a week. She recoils at the specter of going back on welfare, as she was a few years ago: ''I'd rather die,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The city is apologetic. The villain seems to have been the bureaucracy. Child care programs were transferred from the Human Resources Administration to the Administration for Children's Services two years ago. Somehow, until then, nobody noticed the problem, or chose not to.</p>
        <p>''It's unclear to us why the income levels were not updated,'' said Mr. Deacy of Children's Services. He theorized that because in 1990, the city set the highest income ceiling allowed -- 275 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of two, compared with 200 percent in many other parts of the state -- most families qualified for a long time, even under the outdated figures.</p>
        <p>Sandy Socolar, an official of the Welfare Reform Network, wonders if the city's affluence is having an impact. ''For a long time, mothers could find a relative to take care of their children,'' she said. ''But with more and more women in the work force, it's getting harder to make arrangements.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deacy said that the Administration for Children's Services was submitting new income standards to the state by July 30. That may be optimistic, since city officials said months ago that they would submit the figures to the state by May. Then, once the state has them, Albany has to approve the figures. The city will apply the new income ceilings whenever they are official, Mr. Deacy said.</p>
        <p>Maria will probably reapply when new standards go into effect. In the meantime, she scrimps.</p>
