        <p>The domination was clear and seemingly complete after six innings.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte had pitched six impressive shutout innings last night and then ducked into the air-conditioned Yankees clubhouse to keep his arm loose as his teammates were padding their lead to 10-0 over the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
        <p>It was a refreshing lead for a team stumbling through a summer swoon, having lost its last five games in its hallowed home ballpark. It was almost too much of a good thing.</p>
        <p>As Pettitte came out of the cold to pitch the seventh inning, he started to sweat. And press. The left-hander gave up two runs and a walk, and with one out and two men on, Pettitte left the game to the roar of the 40,031 fans who appreciated the value of a solid outing, a rare commodity in the middle of an injured and leaderless rotation.</p>
        <p>Pettitte (9-4) eventually recorded his seventh victory in nine starts in the 12-6 victory over the Orioles, but not before the Yankees recorded two more anxious outs in the seventh, as Baltimore exposed weaknesses in their bullpen.</p>
        <p>The reliever Jason Grimsley gave up two singles and a double, as the Orioles scored four more runs. He was replaced by Mike Stanton, who made one pitch and gave up a single.  But Jeff Nelson faced one batter and halted the Orioles' onslaught.</p>
        <p>The Yankees bounced back in the eighth, however, to score two more runs. ''When we scored those two runs,'' Manager Joe Torre said, 'it seemed like 10.''</p>
        <p>Those runs scored on singles by Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter and Felix Jose, a defensive replacement for right fielder Paul O'Neill, and helped the Yankees break their five-game home losing streak. With the Blue Jays' loss last night, the Yankees now sit four games above .500 at 41-37, and just a half-game behind first-place Toronto in the American League East.</p>
        <p>''We have no right, with our wins and losses over the last month, to expect to be that close to first place the way we've been playing,'' Torre said, ''but hopefully we can use this to our advantage of the fact that we're not out of it.''</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams is one reason the Yankees are very much in the race, as he extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a double in the second inning. He scored on a three-run home run by Scott Brosius, who added a run-scoring single in the Yankees' six-run sixth inning. Williams ignited the Yankees' sixth when he led off with a double.</p>
        <p>Jeter, whom Torre named as an All-Star yesterday, is another key to the keeping the Yankees afloat. He made typically astounding throws from the shortstop hole, especially in the fifth inning to save Pettitte. He hit a solo home run in the fifth and singled and scored in the eighth.</p>
        <p>''He really bailed me out tonight,'' Torre said jokingly, referring to his his All-Star reserve selections.</p>
        <p>But Pettitte has been a bright spot in the Yankees' rotation, which has weathered injuries to Roger Clemens, Orlando Hernandez, Ramiro Mendoza and the ineffectiveness of David Cone.</p>
        <p>While the Yankees were going 10-15 in June, Pettitte won four of his six starts.</p>
        <p>''He's not necessarily an ace,'' Torre said. ''But he's been very consistent for us and in control.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte followed his last outing, a six-hit shutout against Detroit, with six scoreless innings.</p>
        <p>''To get a lead like that, I felt like I should have been able to finish it,'' Pettitte said. ''You get a 10-run lead and you don't want to walk anyone; you want to throw nothing but strikes.'</p>
        <p>He threw a strike, on a 2-0 count, to Orioles catcher Charles Johnson, but it was right down the middle and he belted it for two runs.</p>
        <p>The right-handed Grimsley relieved Pettitte and struggled. He gave up a run-scoring single to Mike Bordick, the first batter he faced, then outfielder B. J. Surhoff cracked a double that scored Anderson. Albert Belle drove in Bordick with a groundout, and Jeff Conine singled Surhoff home for the sixth run of the inning.</p>
        <p>''He was guiding the ball a bit instead of letting go,'' Torre said of Grimsley. ''Sometimes when you get a big lead like that, you want to make sure you throw strikes, and that's the worst thing you could do.''</p>
        <p>Torre called for the left-hander Mike Stanton. Will Clark singled on his only pitch for his second hit of the inning.</p>
        <p>The right-hander Jeff Nelson, finally snuffed the rally. Johnson slapped a ground ball that ricocheted off Nelson's foot, and Jeter collected it and rifled to second for the force.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I had to stop the bleeding,'' Nelson said. ''I know Andy came in here, and that long inning hurt him.''</p>
        <p>In the Yankees' six-run sixth inning, Williams led off a double to left off Pat Rapp (5-6), and he scored his second run when Tino Martinez's single hooked inside the first-base line and into the right-field corner. Rapp left the game after giving up his third walk to Jorge Posada, who was named to the American League All-Star team for the first time earlier in the day. Darren Holmes, a member of the 1998 Yankees, relieved Rapp.</p>
        <p>Holmes gave up a bloop single to Brosius, scoring Martinez. Jose Vizcaino's single to right drove in Posada, and Holmes walked Chuck Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>Jeter's fielder's choice scored Brosius from third, and Paul O'Neill's double to right sent Vizcaino and Jeter home to give the Yankees a short-lived 10-0 lead.</p>
