        <p>When Venus and Serena Williams parade onto Center Court for their singles semifinal at Wimbledon today, Althea Gibson will settle in front of the television set in her New Jersey home and tell her friend, Fran Gray, ''I'll be in London today.''</p>
        <p>Forty-three years ago, on July 4, 1957, Gibson was in London methodically routing Christine Truman, 6-1, 6-1, in the semifinals en route to the first of her two consecutive Wimbledon singles titles; she defeated Darlene Hard, 6-3, 6-2, in the final. Gibson's athletic serve-and-volley style often overwhelmed opponents, and there is no telling how many Wimbledon singles crowns Gibson would have accumulated if she had not signed a pro contract in 1959 that left her ineligible for Grand Slam tournaments in the pre-Open era.</p>
        <p>The emergence of the Williams sisters as Wimbledon singles and doubles semifinalists is more than the latest chapter in their sibling relationship. For Gibson, who turns 73 next month, their success extends her legacy as the first prominent black tennis champion.</p>
        <p>''Althea doesn't have a preference for the two sisters,'' Gray said yesterday, during a telephone interview before joining Gibson for dinner.  ''But she's delighted that both players have developed considerably over the years.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the first day of the Althea Gibson Foundation Summer Camp began yesterday at two parks in New Jersey. Using trained coaches from the United States Tennis Association, the program will involve 250 youngsters through the end of August.</p>
        <p>Gibson began her career on the predominantly black American Tennis Association circuit before winning her two Wimbledon, one French (1956) and two United States national titles (1957-58). Lean and tall at 5 feet 10 1/2 inches, Gibson has retreated from the public these days. She spends much of her time at home and gives few interviews, she has told Gray, ''because I am an athlete, and people won't understand.''</p>
        <p>Gray, the chief executive of the Althea Gibson Foundation, said Gibson remains eager to see more minority group players succeed. Since her success in the 50's, few have done as well: Arthur Ashe won the United States Open in 1968 and Wimbledon in 1975, while Yannick Noah of France won the French Open in 1983. Zina Garrison reached the Wimbledon singles final in 1990, where she lost to Martina Navratilova.</p>
        <p>A recent Rutgers graduate, Carla Porter of East Orange, N.J., is one player Gibson's foundation is hoping to raise funds for to qualify for major tournaments.</p>
