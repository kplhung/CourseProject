        <p>Op-Ed article by Erica S Perl, criminal defense lawyer, discusses recent Supreme Court decision upholding Miranda decision that grants criminal defendants who lack legal representation right to remain silent during interrogation by police; says Miranda has become meaningless in 'age of Oprah,' when everyone wants to confess (S)</p>

        <p>In a dramatically lighted room, two police officers stand over a criminal defendant. One reads the Miranda rights, and the accused closes his eyes. Suddenly, his chair seems more comfortable and the one-way mirror on the wall becomes a sea of interested faces. The female officer's uniform seems a softer shade of blue, and the look on her face becomes one of sisterly concern. The defendant opens his eyes and begins to recount his story.</p>
        <p>''Where did you think you were, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show'? '' I snap at my client. I have just received a copy of the statement he provided to the police, including a written waiver of his Miranda rights. My expression is one of incredulity, but in fact, I am used to this. I have represented hundreds of criminal defendants, and all of those who were told about their right to remain silent ended up waiving it. Even those with tattoos professing their disdain for law enforcement seem to love to tell the police their side of the story.</p>

        <p>In a dramatically lighted room, two police officers stand over a criminal defendant. One reads the Miranda rights, and the accused closes his eyes.

        <p>''Where did you think you were, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show'? '' I snap at my client. I have just received a copy of the statement he provided to the police, including a written waiver of his Miranda rights. My expression is one of incredulity, but in fact, I am used to this. I have represented hundreds of criminal defendants, and all of those who were told about their right to remain silent ended up waiving it. Even those with tattoos professing their disdain for law enforcement seem to love to tell the police their side of the story.</p>
        <p>I have reached an inescapable conclusion: Miranda has become meaningless. In the age of Oprah, everyone wants to confess.</p>
        <p>I was therefore less than impressed last week by the Supreme Court's decision to reaffirm the Miranda rule. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist characterized the Miranda rights as ''part of our national culture,'' and he was more right than he knew. The Miranda warnings -- intended to protect the accused from unwittingly providing the best evidence against himself -- have become so much a part of our culture, so familiar, that no one who receives them pays any attention.</p>
        <p>I have often wondered why my clients make statements to the people who are prosecuting them. Are they really so naive? In some cases, yes. One man told the assistant district attorney questioning him: ''I wanted to have a lawyer present, but that's O.K. You seem real nice.'' He proceeded to explain how the incident was just an argument, not a robbery. The ''nice'' prosecutor got him indicted -- for robbery.</p>
        <p>Many others share a common misunderstanding about Miranda. One client proudly boasted, ''When they arrested me, they didn't read me my rights!'' He clearly expected this to make the charges against him disappear. When I explained that the police don't have to give Miranda rights precisely at the time of arrest, he looked crestfallen. Of course, at the precinct, after being read his rights, he had confessed. He thought it didn't matter at that point because the police had made such a big mistake in failing to read them when he was first handcuffed -- ''like on TV.''</p>
        <p>But by far the most popular reason for confessing is the Oprah phenomenon. Everybody wants his turn in the spotlight. Why else would people go on national television to talk about their cheating spouses or their food addictions or their cheating spouse's food addictions?</p>
        <p>Apparently, the attention of those who are building a criminal case against you has the same appeal. So, as the Miranda warnings are read, my clients don't seem to be thinking, ''Should I talk?'' but rather, ''How can I keep my viewers interested?''</p>
        <p>That is why I don't much feel like rejoicing over Miranda's new lease on life, even though I embrace the principles that underscore the rule. For me, the recitation of ''you have the right to remain silent . . . '' sounds just like theme music for a precinct version of a talk show.</p>
