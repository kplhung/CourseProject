        <p>A committee of New Hampshire lawmakers voted tonight to recommend that Chief Justice David Brock of the State Supreme Court be impeached.</p>
        <p>The decision to recommend impeachment of Chief Justice Brock on accusations that he had committed perjury as he defended himself against charges of ethical improprieties came on a vote of 17 to 5 by the Judiciary Committee of the State House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>The committee also endorsed two other articles of impeachment charging that Brock called a lower-court judge in 1987 in a case involving a powerful state senator, something Brock has denied, and that he solicited comments from a fellow justice about that justice's divorce case, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>The full House is scheduled to decide on the committee's recommendations on July 12. If the House votes for impeachment, the trial, which would be the first such Supreme Court impeachment proceeding in New Hampshire since 1790, will begin in the State Senate in August.</p>
        <p>Two other articles of impeachment against Chief Justice Brock, one accusing him of letting disqualified justices take part in deliberations and the other saying the sum of his actions warranted impeachment, both failed, The AP reported.</p>
        <p>The chief justice has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Brock's lawyer, David Barry, said tonight that the committee had lowered the threshold for impeachment too far. Historically, he said, officials have been impeached for willful misconduct, not poor judgment.</p>
        <p>''An impeachment of the chief justice based on the evidence found will stand out as a historical aberration,'' Mr. Barry was quoted by The AP as saying.</p>
        <p>The committee also decided against impeaching or reprimanding two State Supreme Court justices, Sherman D. Horton Jr. and John T. Broderick Jr., who were also accused of ethical missteps.</p>
        <p>The committee voted 19 to 3 against impeaching Justice Horton and 16 to 6 against admonishing Justice Broderick. Both had been accused of failing to turn in the colleague who tried to intercede in his own divorce case and of discussing cases from which they had recused themselves because of possible bias.</p>
        <p>But State Representative Cynthia J. Dokmo, a Republican who is one of several lawyers on the committee, said, ''Whether we impeach them or not, their reputations are forever damaged by this process.''</p>
        <p>The New Hampshire judicial crisis began with an ugly divorce, the split between a State Supreme Court justice, W. Stephen Thayer III, and his wife, Judith, a former chairwoman of the State Board of Education. Judith Thayer appealed aspects of the case up to the very court on which her former husband sat, and its justices, unable to rule on their own colleague, had to appoint a special panel of other judges to hear the case.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general, Justice Thayer, who has since resigned, vehemently objected to the choice of a particular judge for that panel. In response, Chief Justice Brock tried to prevent the court clerk from calling that judge but was too late.</p>
        <p>That incident, which the court clerk reported to a judicial conduct committee, prompted a broader inquiry into the court's practices by the State Attorney General, Philip T. McLaughlin. It found a worrisome pattern of justices' being allowed to comment on cases even when they had excused themselves because of potential conflicts of interest.</p>
        <p>Although the court had already issued new rules on recusals, the incident also raised strenuous protests from court critics across the state, many of whom were already contending that the court overstepped its bounds in a major 1997 ruling that revamped the state's heavily local system of financing schools. Lingering anger among lawmakers over that decision could mean trouble for Chief Justice Brock as the Legislature decides his fate, political analysts here say.</p>
        <p>Critics of the court in the Legislature moved this spring for an inquiry into whether any justices should be impeached, and the Judicial Committee of the House took up the question in April. It has since heard testimony laying bare some of the innermost workings of the court.</p>
        <p>Another, somewhat dusty case figured prominently in the discussions: accusations that in 1987, Justice Brock intervened in a case involving a powerful state senator and commented that the senator held some control over justices' pay raises.</p>
        <p>Justice Brock denies making the call.</p>
