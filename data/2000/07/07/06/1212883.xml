        <p>Judge Judith A Yaskin dismisses main charges in suit by Carl A Williams charging Gov Christine Todd Whitman and then-Atty Gen Peter G Verniero ousted him as head of New Jersey State Police in Feb 1999 in retaliation after he was quoted as blaming blacks and Latinos for state's drug problems; rejects his stand that Verniero had duty to tell him he had right to hearing and was not required to resign (M)</p>

        <p>A state judge today threw out the main charges in a lawsuit filed by the former head of the New Jersey State Police, who had accused the governor and other top state officials of ousting him in retaliation after he was quoted as saying that blacks and Latinos were primarily to blame for the state's drug problems.</p>
        <p>In October, Carl A. Williams, who was superintendent of the state police from 1994 until February 1999, sued Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Peter G.

        <p>A state judge today threw out the main charges in a lawsuit filed by the former head of the New Jersey State Police, who had accused the governor and other top state officials of ousting him in retaliation after he was quoted as saying that blacks and Latinos were primarily to blame for the state's drug problems.</p>
        <p>In October, Carl A. Williams, who was superintendent of the state police from 1994 until February 1999, sued Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Peter G. Verniero, who was attorney general when Mr. Williams resigned in February 1999. Mr. Williams contended that Mr. Verniero had a duty to tell him that he had a right to a hearing and that he was not required to resign.</p>
        <p>But Judge Judith A. Yaskin of Superior Court ruled today that as one of the top law enforcement officials in the state, Mr. Williams should have known that he was entitled to a hearing. ''The judge said that the governor had the right to request his resignation, and that he had voluntarily agreed to resign, so he was not covered by federal or state discrimination laws,'' said Rosemary Alito, a lawyer who represented the state, the governor and the governor's spokesman, Pete McDonough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said Mr. McDonough had defamed him by calling his suit ''pathetic, boneheaded or baseless.'' The judge dismissed that claim, as well, without ruling on the veracity of Mr. McDonough's remark.</p>
        <p>All that remains of the suit are separate allegations of defamation, against Assemblyman Leroy J. Jones Jr., and of libel, against The Star-Ledger, which published Mr. Williams's remarks in February 1999. A ruling is expected on motions to dismiss those charges on July 21.</p>
