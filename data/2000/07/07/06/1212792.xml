        <p>The Polish writer Gustaw Herling's harrowing account of his imprisonment in a Soviet labor camp in the early years of World War II was recounted in ''A World Apart,'' first published in England in 1951. Here are excerpts  from that work and from ''The Island,'' a collection of three stories.</p>
        <p>''Please read this,'' -- her voice trembled -- ''but don't tell anyone where you got it from. It is banned these days -- especially here,'' she added with a smile. I took a ragged, disintegrating book from her hand and looked at the cover: Dostoyevsky, ''The House of the Dead,'' Petersburg 1894.</p>
        <p>Two months passed; during that time I read ''The House of the Dead'' twice, but I saw Natalia Ivanova only from a distance in the zone, and greeted her always with a friendly wave of the hand. She looked at me with anxiety, as if she wanted to see from my expression whether the book had made the expected impression on me. I avoided talking to her, though I would always regret my decision as I watched her walking slowly to her barrack, greeting everyone who passed with a polite nod.</p>
        <p>I avoided her because from the moment when I read the first few pages of the book until I closed it for the second and last time at the final paragraph: ''Yes, with God's blessing! Freedom, new life, resurrection from the dead . . .'' I lived in a state of trance, as if I had woken from a long mortal sleep. The thing about the book was not Dostoyevsky's ability to describe inhuman suffering as if it were a natural part of human destiny, but that aspect of it which also struck Natalia . . . : that there was not the slightest break between his fate and ours. I read the book in the evenings, at night, and also in the daytime, robbing myself of sleep. My heart beat like the clapper of a bell and my head hummed with a tumult which increased like the infinitely repeated echo of countless drops of water, which fall at regular intervals on the same spot of the skull, and seem to crack it every time with the resounding blow of a hammer.</p>
        <p>It was one of the most difficult periods of my prison life. I read the book at night under the cover of my jerkin, and in the daytime concealed it in the safest place on the bunk, under a loose plank near the head. I hated it and loved it, as a victim can become attached to the instrument of his torture. After my return from work I always looked anxiously to see if it was still in place, but on the way to the barrack I subconsciously longed for it to disappear without return, that I might be free once and for all from this nightmare of life without hope. I did not know then that a mental condition of full consciousness is more dangerous in slavery than hunger and physical death. Until then I had lived like other prisoners, instinctively avoiding the necessity to come face to face with my own existence.</p>
        <p>-- From ''A World Apart'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), translated from the Polish by Joseph Marek.</p>
        <p>There was a pause after the first strong knell broken by the dying heartbeats of iron on bronze; they were strung out like broken pearls, smaller and ever quieter, until they melted in their own echoes. Then a few more knells but violent and rapid as if the bell-ringer hoped to overcome his fatigue with sheer obstinacy, like a traveler on the last stretch of road before the peak. Again a chaotic sequence of broken sounds and echoes filled the air, bouncing off each other, suffocating, going off in all directions, and gradually vanishing in the commotion of a new day and in the cries of the fisherman. The silence that followed was so long that it seemed that the bell-ringer must still be hanging onto the rope.</p>
        <p>-- From the title story of ''The Island'' (Penguin Books, 1967), translated by Ronald Strom.</p>
