        <p>HER name, Angele Parlange, could be a new perfume. And when she opens the door, wearing aqua silk pants printed with 19th-century signatures, legs slim as dental floss, it hardly seems surprising to encounter a silk tent over the dining table, festooned with ostrich plumes.</p>
        <p>Is it decor or a masked ball?</p>
        <p>In a city of ancestor worship, where family history comes entombed in leather-bound albums, Ms. Parlange may be the nerviest gal in town. From the eighth generation to be raised at Parlange, one of Louisiana's most celebrated plantations, she has ancestors who include a justice of the state Supreme Court and the Parisian socialite Virginie Gautreau, better known as Madame X of the John Singer Sargent portrait.</p>
        <p>Like Scarlett O'Hara, who fashioned a dress by ripping down her mother's curtains, Ms. Parlange has creatively and flamboyantly reinterpreted her family traditions in fabric, china and interior designs of the hyperfeminine variety. She thinks nothing of borrowing from the legacy of her great-great-grandmother and then dressing it up Mardi Gras-style in feather boas and fuchsia taffeta: call the look Parlangerie.</p>
        <p>Her rooms sport the come-hither look coursing through fashion. Perhaps only Ms. Parlange -- whose great-great-grandmother saved the plantation from destruction by wooing Union troops with food, wine and riveting repartee -- could fashion turquoise silk curtains printed with French love poems and not seem a floozy. ''Angele is comfortable with antebellum culture, but with her it becomes a living thing rather than stuffed behind glass,'' said Jane Stubbs, her friend and now proprietor of a rare books and prints boutique at Bergdorf Goodman. ''We usually get a big dose of the Old South. It's pride-making to have a Southern designer not going down that road.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parlange grew up surrounded by gilt mirrors and Sevres vases shipped back from Paris by her great-great grandmother Virginie de Ternant Parlange. ''I know the proper things,'' she said of a childhood in which silver egg cups appeared daily at the breakfast table and milk was served in silver mint julep cups. ''I've always been surrounded by portraits and stories and family furniture. I like expressing myself using history. It forms you.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parlange, who taught Martha Stewart how to mix a sazerac, the beloved New Orleans cocktail, on television, lives in a five-room apartment in the city's Uptown district.</p>
        <p>Her home is itself a cocktail of creolized influences, not the least of which is autobiography. Family photographs are silk-screened on draperies. The silk tent, for instance, an extravaganza of yardage with cascading organdy sheers, recalls her girlhood at Parlange, where pigeonniers lined pea-gravel pathways and there were stroll gardens dense with camelias and ardisia.</p>
        <p>''There were little tents in the garden,'' she recalled one evening, graciously offering a sazerac, made from rye whiskey, locally produced Peychaud's bitters, Herbsaint (a locally made absinthe substitute) and sugar, and there were always places to hide behind the odd Remington statue. ''I loved the feeling of pretending, of being somewhere else. My mother always assured us there were fairies.''</p>
        <p>There were certainly illustrious visitors, like the Duchess of Devonshire, owner of Chatsworth in England. (Parlange itself, built in the style of a raised West Indian cottage, is considered the cover girl of Louisiana plantation architecture.)</p>
        <p>''We had the grandest time,'' her mother, who is known as Miss Lucy, said of her daughter's childhood.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parlange has recreated the festive atmosphere at home. At dinner beneath the big top, she sets the table with raspberry- and tangerine-trimmed china, her own Maltby Collection Lustree, available at Bergdorf Goodman. Place cards are in the shape of poodles or mermaids. Lump crabmeat frequently overflows from the soup tureen.</p>
        <p>An architect friend of Ms. Parlange, William Sonner, collaborated in the design of an aqua table, its arabesque shape inspired by her fabric.</p>
        <p>''People get dressed up when they go to Angele's,'' observed Julia Reed, a Vogue writer, who regards the masked-ball decor as a Southernized version of ''The Thin Man.'' ''They don't want to look dull in the setting.''</p>
        <p>Practically every nook contains some element of family history. The guest bedroom, for instance, was inspired by her grandmother's lilac-color lusterware oyster plates, which hang decoratively on the wall near the aubergine draperies. (The word purple does not exist in Ms. Parlange's vocabulary.) They are printed with silver scroll motifs adapted from New Orleans ironwork.</p>
        <p>At the turn of the 20th century, when oysters on the half shell were fashionable, the leading porcelain and china manufacturers produced decorative sets of oyster plates as the appetizer equivalent of cake plates.</p>
        <p>The spool bed is the one she grew up in, its headboard slipcovered with lavender silk. A beaded chandelier drops romantically from the canopy.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to go to bed in something that's pretty and unusual,'' she said. ''I like to have a little surprise in rooms that makes them interesting.''</p>
        <p>She tweaks antiques, upholstering them in hothouse colors -- like the French daybed in the living room, covered in orchid silk. It is the home-design equivalent of painting one's toenails Lilly Pulitzer coral.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parlange, a former dress designer, often uses dress fabrics for furniture, especially douppioni, an Indian silk. Feather boas (for her boudoir-bedroom) and ostrich plumes come from theatrical and costume shops. She bought a 1950's steel laboratory cabinet and took it to an auto-body shop to have it spray-painted celadon. ''Corvette colors weren't the right look,'' she said, ''so I had to go to BMW.''</p>
        <p>Her fabrics are not in release, but like her china and tabletop accessories, they wittily plumb the ancestral depths. One pattern was inspired by Virginie, who forsook the swamps to spend half the year in Paris in her chateau and salon. Visiting viscounts and other aristocrats would leave their calling cards, which Ms. Parlange unearthed, impressed by their beautiful script and crests.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parlange, who is working as an independent design and style consultant, began her entrepreneurial career selling horseback rides down the endless driveway of Parlange, then eventually graduated to selling Kleenex, two for a nickel, by the side of the road. Before long, she had a store called the Tree House set up on the porch of Parlange, where she sold beaded matchboxes to tourists visiting the house. She began her home furnishings line of fabrics and furniture in 1991, at stores like Neiman Marcus, ABC Carpet &amp; Home and Barneys. More recently, she has collaborated with Mr. Sonner on the design of Gamay Bistro, a top New Orleans restaurant. She had a retail store for five years but closed it last May, sending out announcements inviting friends and customers to an I.A.D.T. sale (translation: I Already Did That).</p>
        <p>The invitations were illustrated with a cartoon of a young woman in a vintage convertible -- a chic young woman who was eager to go places.</p>
        <p>In New Orleans, Ms. Parlange finds inspiration at Lucullus Antiques, at 3932 Magazine Street and 610 Chartres Street, which specialize in French culinary antiques and has a good selection of oyster plates.</p>
        <p>Ann Koerner, at 4021 Magazine Street, stocks a great selection of unfusty antiques. (Ms. Parlange found her vintage wallpaper and mirrored curtain tiebacks there.)</p>
        <p>Bush Antiques, at 2109 Magazine Street, has F.F.F. (fine French furniture), but also small interesting pieces -- like the metal chandelier that Ms. Parlange easily reinvented with tinted silver leaf.</p>
