        <p>Richard Virenque was carbo loading at a late breakfast this morning, dousing his spaghetti with olive oil after he had downed several chunks of baguette with jam, when he consented to a small audience. His bodyguard was nowhere visible.</p>
        <p>His bodyguard?</p>
        <p>Virenque, the French climber for the Polti team from Italy, usually travels with a large crowd of co-workers who are escorted by 33 motorcycle policemen, with hundreds of additional gendarmes posted at every intersection with the Tour de France's roads.</p>
        <p>Thus, chances of abduction or armed aggression or any of the other threats that confront a pop star seem slim.</p>
        <p>No, team officials explained, the bodyguard is there to assure Virenque's privacy and freedom of movement among his many fans. His many, many fans, as the rider himself puts it.</p>
        <p>The muscle being absent and the privacy invaded, Virenque allowed himself a few comments about the team time trial Tuesday, which may have proved disastrous for him and some other contenders for the overall leader's yellow jersey.</p>
        <p>Alex Zulle, the Swiss leader of the Banesto team from Spain, who finished second over all in the last Tour, lost nearly four minutes, for example. Marco Pantani, the Italian leader of the Mercatone Uno team from his homeland, lost more than three minutes and is 5 minutes 26 seconds behind the leader, Laurent Jalabert, a Frenchman with ONCE from Spain.</p>
        <p>Fernando Escartin, the Spaniard who leads the Kelme team from his homeland and who finished third last year, lost more than five minutes and is 6:16 behind. Laurent Dufaux, a Swiss with Saeco from Italy and fourth last year, also lost more than five minutes and is 6:25 behind.</p>
        <p>''It was hard, very hard,'' Virenque said of the 43-mile course into a strong headwind.</p>
        <p>He and his Polti teammates lost nearly five minutes too, leaving him 5:46 adrift.</p>
        <p>''The team worked well; we did what we could,'' Virenque said. ''You spend a lot of energy in a stage like that but I'm pleased that I came out of it relatively fresh.''</p>
        <p>Nor did they worsen later in the day after a 125.5-mile slog in Brittany from Vannes to Vitre in cool weather and intermittent rain.</p>
        <p>After Jens Voigt, a German with Credit Agricole from France, and Erik Dekker, a Dutchman with Rabobank from the Netherlands, were caught in the last kilometer after their second long breakaway of this 87th Tour, the fifth of 21 stages was decided once again by a mass sprint.</p>
        <p>The winner this time was Marcel Wust, a German with Festina from France and a most unlikely wearer of the polka dot jersey of the race's best climber, which he won in the one previous climb. He lost it during the stage today, which passed over four small climbs before huge crowds in the soothing countryside.</p>
        <p>''It's a good trade-off, the climber's jersey for the stage victory,'' Wust said. The second-place finisher on Monday, Wust finished half a bicycle length ahead of another German, Erik Zabel, who rides for Telekom. Stefano Zanini, an Italian with Mapei from Italy, was third, with Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei and the winner of two sprints this week, fourth.</p>
        <p>All of them and 26 others were timed in 4:19.05, a speed of about 29 miles an hour with a brisk tailwind. Jalabert finished in a bigger pack 10 seconds behind, losing that time to such contenders as Lance Armstrong, the American leader of the U.S. Postal Service team and the defending champion, and Jan Ullrich, a German with Telekom and the winner of the 1997 Tour.</p>
        <p>Jalabert remained in the yellow jersey by 12 seconds ahead of his teammate, David Canada, a Spaniard, with Armstrong third, 14 seconds behind. That relationship is perfect for Armstrong, whose team, unlike Jalabert's, does not have to spend its energy defending the jersey by chasing breakaways before the Tour really gets going in the mountains.</p>
        <p>That terrain -- the Pyrenees on Monday and Mont Ventoux and the Alps starting July 13 -- are prominent in the thinking of Virenque, who finished 39th today. The king of the mountains five times in the Tour, he can tie the record by becoming the top climber again this year. ''My day will come,'' Virenque said while discussing the team time trial.</p>
        <p>Over all, he seemed relaxed and hungry, and not only for breakfast. Compared with last year, when the Tour tried to ban him because of his involvement in the Festina drug scandal of 1998, Virenque has described himself as serene. He still faces court charges in that case in October.</p>
