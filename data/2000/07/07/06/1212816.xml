        <p>Shares of Computer Associates International and BMC Software, two of the nation's largest business software companies, plunged in heavy trading yesterday after the companies warned that earnings in the quarter that ended last Friday would be well below expectations.</p>
        <p>Both companies said a slowdown in sales of software for mainframe computers was their main problem as major customers delayed purchases of such ''big iron'' until I.B.M. delivers its next generation of mainframes later this year. Investors' assumptions that I.B.M. would have disappointing news when it announces its earnings on July 19 in turn jolted that company's shares.</p>
        <p>Computer Associates, the dominant maker of utility software that helps mainframe computers operate more efficiently and reliably, finished the day at $29.25 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down $21.875, or nearly 43 percent. BMC, which is especially strong in data management software for mainframes, fell by almost the same percentage in over-the-counter trading on the Nasdaq, finishing at $21.3125, down $14.1875.</p>
        <p>International Business Machines, on volume more than twice its average, lost about 6 percent to close at $103.75.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the outlook was unlikely to improve soon.</p>
        <p>''The next quarter doesn't look very healthy, either,'' said Ray Paquet, who analyzes mainframe computer markets for the Gartner Group, a research company based in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>Computer Associates, based in Islandia, N.Y., issued its warning on Monday night and held a conference call with analysts before trading began yesterday. Sanjay Kumar, president and chief operating officer at the company, said revenue from contracts would be $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion for the quarter, up only slightly from $1.22 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>In addition to disappointing mainframe software orders, Computer Associates had disappointing results in Europe that Mr. Kumar pledged would lead to a management shake-up.</p>
        <p>Most of the 20 analysts who follow the company for stock brokerage firms did not immediately announce reductions in their earnings estimates, according to First Call, which tracks such figures. But the consensus of the handful of analysts who did was that Computer Associates earned just 14 cents a share in the quarter, down from a consensus estimate of 55 cents before the announcement.</p>
        <p>BMC, which is based in Houston, gave much more explicit guidance when it issued its warning yesterday morning. When it reports on July 25, BMC said, revenue is likely to be $365 million to $375 million; net earnings, $47 million to $51 million; and diluted earnings, 18 cents to 21 cents a share, down at least 50 percent from the 42 cents a share it reported a year earlier.</p>
        <p>I.B.M., which as recently as May said that the mainframe market appeared to be rebounding, declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Analysts said there was no single factor behind the weakness in the mainframe market. Mr. Paquet, among others, said that part of the slowdown probably resulted from computer users redeploying mainframes and software that they had bought to help with testing for Year 2000 computer problems.</p>
        <p>As much as 35 percent of mainframe sales in the latter part of 1999 may have been for such preparedness, analysts say, and most of those purchases were accompanied by software sales so that the testing could accurately mimic actual conditions. Now, a substantial part of that computing power is being put to work to support e-commerce and other new applications.</p>
        <p>Another factor may be the growing capacities of other platforms, like Unix and Windows NT systems. Some users may be balking at the pricing policies of Computer Associates, which make it harder for I.B.M. mainframe users to add capacity and new applications than for users of Unix to do so, according to Peter Burris, an analyst at the META Group in Stamford, Conn. Last April, META cut its forecasts for growth in mainframe capacity in half.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paquet said that Gartner clients reported in March that both Computer Associates and BMC were pressing them to complete deals so that the companies could meet Wall Street's growth expectations for the fourth quarter of their fiscal year. By moving sales that would otherwise have fallen in the first quarter of the current fiscal year forward, the companies set the stage for a tougher three months in the quarter that just ended.</p>
        <p>Both companies are also digesting major acquisitions. Analysts said the poor quarter could also be a sign of trouble on that front.</p>
