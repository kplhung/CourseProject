        <p>A Mac Returns To Tennis Racket</p>
        <p>It is true that PATRICK McENROE made good his escape from the pressures of the professional tennis tour two years ago, finding gainful employment as a color commentator for ESPN and CBS. Then he took on the role of morning sports guy on the DON IMUS radio program.</p>
        <p>So why is he now fielding his own new tennis team as a player/owner?</p>
        <p>''I still love to play,'' he said. Really? ''Yes, and this gives me an impetus to get my posterior in shape,'' he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Mr. McEnroe, 34, is the force behind the New York Hamptons, which will kick off -- er, serve up -- their first season at home on July 13 in East Quogue at the 1,500-seat Sportime in the Hamptons club.</p>
        <p>Why locate the New York Hamptons in, well, the Hamptons? ''I grew up on the Island,'' he said, ''my parents have a place there, and I wanted to play where there was a good tennis crowd, a good tennis aura.''</p>
        <p>The New York Hamptons are the newest entrant in the nine-team DuPont World Team Tennis Professional League. It features four-member coed singles and doubles teams playing rapid-paced tennis. Among Mr. McEnroe's partners are JIM COURIER and MONIQUE VIELE; they expect to play such legends as MONICA SELES and MARTINA NAVRATILOVA during the team's three-week season.</p>
        <p>But next week, he may log in some sleepy practices if the Imus show resumes, since Mr. McEnroe has to punch the clock at 5:30 a.m. The show went to reruns after the host broke five ribs in a June 18 riding accident. ''It's up in the air as to whether he'll be back next Monday,'' Mr. McEnroe said of the I-Patient.</p>
        <p>Irish Remember A Different OpSail</p>
        <p>Call it the Energizer OpSail: it just keeps on going and going. Last night, 250 revelers gathered aboard the Irish naval flagship, the L.E. Eithne, to honor the Irish-government-sponsored construction of a replica of an 1845 bark, the Jeanie Johnston. The original tall ship was one of the ''famine ships'' that transported more than 1.5 million people from a starving Ireland beset by the potato famine.</p>
        <p>''Since it's an Irish event, there's an appropriate song,'' said BRIAN KENNEDY, a star of the Broadway show ''Riverdance,'' who lifted his tenor in a rendition of ''Lift the Wings.'' This second-act ballad, about the famine, has the lyrics ''Lift the wings that carry me away from here -- and fill the sail that breaks the line to home.''</p>
        <p>His audience included BARRIE ROBINSON, Ireland's consul general, and MICHAEL SMITH, Ireland's defense minister. ''In the new millennium,'' said the 33-year-old Mr. Kennedy, ''it's good to be reminded of how Irish people arrived in this country.''</p>
        <p>Satchmo Birthday A Movable Feast</p>
        <p>The fireworks may have cooled, but there is a burning question raised by ''Hotter Than That,'' the Independence Day concert in Liberty State Park played by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra.</p>
        <p>Billed as a ''celebration of the 100th birthday of Louis Armstrong,'' the program featured the orchestra's artistic director, WYNTON MARSALIS, presenting such Armstrong hits as ''Ain't Misbehavin.' ''</p>
        <p>Armstrong often claimed that July 4 was his birthday, but subsequent research unearthed a birth certificate ''showing that he was born Aug. 4, 1901,'' said ROB GIBSON, the orchestra's executive producer and director.</p>
        <p>''But the mythical birthdate is the one that should be celebrated,'' Mr. Gibson said, ''because it's the one that Armstrong celebrated for his whole life.''</p>
        <p>Yes, but how does Mr. Gibson reconcile this discrepancy? The July 4 concert ''was the kickoff to a 13-month celebration of Louis Armstrong,'' he said, a world tour of the jazz orchestra.</p>
        <p>And when will this birthday bash end? ''On Aug. 4, 2001,'' Mr. Gibson said.</p>
