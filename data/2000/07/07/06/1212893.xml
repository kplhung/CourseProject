        <p>An official of the Fourth of July Parade of Sail yesterday defended  decisions by two captains to turn 27 tall ships around before reaching Upper Manhattan, a move that disappointed thousands of eager spectators. The defense came as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suggested that the organizers of OpSail may have barely managed to execute the whole event.</p>
        <p>The captains of the Eagle, from the United States Coast Guard, and the Cisne Branco, from Brazil, led  separate turnarounds of two lines of ships on the Hudson River, said Gregory Perrin, vice president of OpSail, the nonprofit group that put on the event. Both captains turned around farther south than scheduled to make sure their ships had time to dock safely, before the tides changed, he said. The other tall ships followed their lead.</p>
        <p>But one OpSail executive, Paul Welling, a retired Coast Guard vice admiral, said that while the dozen ships docking on the East River had to turn around early to take advantage of ideal tidal conditions, those docking on the Hudson should not have had to turn around.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people in Upper Manhattan and northern New Jersey were let down when the full parade did not go all the way up to the George Washington Bridge as they had expected. Most of the four-masted Class A ships measured more than 300 feet in length and were the most impressive in the parade.</p>
        <p>At a news conference at P.S. 48 in Washington Heights, Mayor Giuliani declined to address the turnaround, but said that there were tensions between the city and OpSail.</p>
        <p>''We did not have the greatest relationship with OpSail, so I am not about to defend them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I did note from the complaints that I got from the people who worked with OpSail that this was not a terribly well-managed operation.  Now, they pulled it off, it worked. But there were times in which it almost looked like it wasn't going to work at all.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Perrin said that ''all the operations went off without a hitch.''</p>
        <p>As for the turnaround, the captains could have been reacting to a number of variables, including currents and wind conditions, he said. The parade started on time and did not delay the ships, he said.</p>
        <p>''The captain of a vessel is ultimately responsible for the safety of that vessel,'' Mr. Perrin said. ''Whatever variables came into play, OpSail is not in a position to question the decisions.''</p>
        <p>The captains wanted to get their ships to their berths during slack water, an eight-minute window of time when the tide is not coming in or going out, Mr. Perrin said. On the East River especially, the water can be treacherous at other times, and tall ships cannot be maneuvered easily into the narrow piers. Such a ship could ram into a pier or breach its hull if it tried docking any time outside the period of slack water.</p>
        <p>Nautical experts can predict well in advance when slack water will occur, Mr. Perrin said, but factors like weather and water currents can affect how quickly a ship can travel.</p>
        <p>Capt. Ivan Luke, of the Eagle, was leading 11 other tall ships when he  turned around at 47th Street to make it in time to piers on the East River, where the ships were supposed to dock, Mr. Perrin said.</p>
        <p>But as early as last week, that group of ships, which included the Rose and the Danmark, was scheduled to turn around at 79th Street to catch the slack water at the South Street Seaport and Pier 36, he said. Then on Tuesday, the lack of wind and their unfurled sails slowed them down and forced them to turn around at 47th Street, Mr. Welling said.</p>
        <p>Most spectators were apparently unaware of the plan to turn around at 79th Street. Mr. Perrin insisted he told the media about the scheduled turnaround at 79th Street, but the OpSail Web site did not mention it.</p>
        <p>''All vessels will pass in review between the Statue of Liberty and the Reviewing Platform,'' the Web site said. ''They will proceed up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge. The vessels will then reverse course and proceed to assigned berths or anchorages.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Welling said that when the destination was switched last week to 79th Street, he had told the dozen ships to increase their speed from six to nine knots to get to that point in time.</p>
        <p>According to the schedule, all 27 of the tall ships were supposed to be in their berths and open for public viewing by 3:30 p.m. Mr. Welling said the dozen ships docking on the East River had to catch slack water between 12:51 p.m. and 1 p.m. If they missed that, he said, they would have had to wait several hours for the tide to shift and then use tug boats.</p>
        <p>After the first group turned back, the Cisne Branco continued leading the other 15 ships up the Hudson.  That group was scheduled to turn around a half-mile south of the bridge. But Capt. Jose Sadi Canturia of the Cisne Branco decided to turn the group back at 127th Street so that each ship could get to its Hudson River berth during slack water, Mr. Perrin said.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Perrin's statement, Mr. Welling said he did not know why the Cisne Branco decided to turn back early, because slack water is considerably less of a factor at the piers on the Hudson River, which are spaced farther apart.</p>
        <p>Captain Canturia could not be reached for comment yesterday; Captain Luke was on shore leave yesterday. The Coast Guard released a brief written statement that said ''due to tidal conditions, Operation Sail 2000 decided to turn some of the tall ships.''</p>
        <p>Dozens of the smaller ships continued up to the bridge, appeasing some of the waiting spectators there. One of them, John Dyett, was standing near the bridge with his camera when he heard what sounded like thunder. He watched as a Canadian sailing ship emerged from the haze, its cannons blazing. ''Everyone was appreciative of the Canadians,'' he said.</p>
