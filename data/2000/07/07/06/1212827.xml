        <p>The New York affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said yesterday that it would broadcast a 30-second advertisement that is intended to cast doubts about the abortion record of Representative Rick A.

        <p>The New York affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said yesterday that it would broadcast a 30-second advertisement that is intended to cast doubts about the abortion record of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate. The group, which has endorsed Mr. Lazio's Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said it would spend $50,000, a relatively modest amount, buying time on cable stations with sizable audiences of women.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''One Question.''  PRODUCER -- Sheinkopf Ltd., which is usually allied with Democratic candidates and committees.  ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial opens with a shot of Ross DeMarco, a member of the abortion rights group. She is sitting with her hands clasped, speaking to the camera. It cuts to text -- ''How Would Lazio Vote on Judges?'' -- before showing footage of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Robert Bork, a conservative judge who was rejected by the Senate. It then superimposes a headline from The New York Post referring to Mr. Lazio as being a ''master of ambiguity'' on abortion and cuts to more text -- ''Would Lazio Oppose Anti-Choice Judges?'' It ends with a telephone number for the abortion rights group.  THE SCRIPT -- ''I have one question for Rick Lazio,'' Ms. DeMarco says. ''How would he vote in the United States Senate when it comes to the Supreme Court and abortion? Like most New Yorkers, I believe it's a woman's right to decide. One Supreme Court decision could rob us of this choice. Now Rick Lazio is saying he can't promise New Yorkers he'd oppose anti-choice judges. So how would Rick Lazio vote on Supreme Court nominations? It's a simple question. New Yorkers deserve an answer.''  ACCURACY -- Mr. Lazio generally supports abortion rights, but he opposes the use of government money to pay for abortions, and he has also voted to ban the procedure that abortion critics refer to as ''partial birth'' abortion. As the advertisement states, Mr. Lazio has declined to pledge to vote against Supreme Court nominees opposed to abortion rights. In recent days, though, he has emphasized that he would consider abortion views in deciding whether to confirm them. ''I just don't think there ought to be any litmus test,'' he said on the campaign trail yesterday. Mrs. Clinton has said she would not vote for a nominee opposed to abortion.  SCORECARD -- The advertisement is clearly directed at suburban women, a constituency that strongly favors abortion rights, and one that Mrs. Clinton has had a difficult time wooing. The Clinton campaign and its allies have repeatedly sought to depict Mr. Lazio as too conservative for New York. But because Mr. Lazio generally supports abortion rights, the abortion rights group is forced to make a more nuanced attack to draw a distinction between the two candidates, focusing on his position on judicial nominees, rather than on abortion itself. The commercial thus seeks to link Mr. Lazio to the possibility of a more conservative Supreme Court that would be hostile to abortion. The question is whether this strategy will galvanize suburban women, given that they have lived for so long under the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Mr. Lazio has also tried to turn the abortion issue against Mrs. Clinton by asserting that her opposition to banning ''partial birth'' abortion is extreme and does not jibe with the views of most New Yorkers and even some prominent Democrats, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring.</p>
        <p>''The fact is the difference between Naral and myself is that I support the ban on partial-birth abortion,'' Mr. Lazio said yesterday. ''They are strongly opposed to the ban. And that defines the difference between Hillary Clinton, Naral and me. I think my position is a mainstream position.''</p>
