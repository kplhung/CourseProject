        <p>THERE is nothing lower tech than a hammock, but it seems to be this summer's high-tech-shopping winner. Some Web sites specialize in hammocks, many of them handmade. Abbey Lee and her husband, Ben, of Lubbock, Tex., own green-eggs.com., which sells a full selection of hammocks, including handmade ones from Mexico and Nicaragua. The site's sales have tripled since last summer. ''It's a great way to relax in a stressful world,'' Ms. Lee said, adding that people seem to like the hand-woven pieces, each one unique. There are countless hammock accessories available online, from stands (for those who don't have trees), pillows and liners to canopies, mosquito netting and hardware. And for those who prefer to do their swinging in the shade, there are portable outdoor awnings and collapsible gazebos.</p>
