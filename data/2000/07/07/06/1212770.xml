        <p>Although it is possible to send digital photos to relatives via e-mail, the gesture may not be appreciated if the recipient does not have a high-speed Internet connection for downloading the image files.</p>
        <p>Now, a photo album Web site (www.cartogra .com) operated by Hewlett-Packard offers a way to share pictures and minimize the frustration generated by endless downloading.</p>
        <p>The Web site (the name is a combination of cartography and photography) allows users to upload digital images, either scanned or made with a digital camera, to create up to five online photo albums that will hold a total of about 100 photographs. Users may choose to open their albums to all visitors to the site, limit viewing by assigning a password or keep the albums private.</p>
        <p>To let Granny see pictures of Johnny's birthday, you click on a navigation button that forwards an e-mail message containing a password-encoded link. At the site, Granny sees thumbnail pictures, which download fairly quickly. Clicking on the thumbnails produces a larger image. Viewers of the pictures can print their photos themselves, but by late summer they will be able to order prints from the site, the company said. The company said the prints would cost 50 cents for a 4-by-6-inch print and $3 for an 8-by-10.</p>
        <p>The system does not eliminate all waiting. Users can upload only three images at a time when creating albums. Cartogra's marketing manager, Blake Miller, said that each upload should take ''a couple of minutes'' for dial-up modem users who took their pictures with a medium-priced digital camera. Higher-quality images, like photo CD's created from scanned photographic film, upload at a glacial pace with a dial-up modem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said that Hewlett-Packard intended to keep the basic album service free, apparently as a way to spur printer and scanner sales.</p>
        <p>Additional services may become available for fees. One idea is the long-term archival storage of images to replace, as Mr. Miller put it, ''that shoe box most people have in the back of a closet that's full of photos they never get around to organizing.''</p>
