        <p>He will be playing out of position, but Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo made the National League All-Star team today, and he does not mind being used as a shortstop.</p>
        <p>Choosing from a cluster of talented second basemen but having no worthy shortstop candidates, the Atlanta Braves' manager, Bobby Cox, selected Alfonzo and Montreal's Jose Vidro to the All-Star team and said Alfonzo would be his first option to back up the starting shortstop Barry Larkin.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's different when you adapt yourself to play the infield,'' Alfonzo said. ''What I always do during batting practice is take ground balls at shortstop. That way, it helps my feet and my control at second base, makes me a little bit more quick. You change your angle, but you have the same ground balls.''</p>
        <p>But Alfonzo has never fielded a ground ball stamped with an official All-Star Game logo. The 26-year-old, who is in his sixth season and entered tonight's game hitting .333, is one of eight first-time All-Stars on the National League team. The American League team, selected by Yankees Manager Joe Torre, has 13 first-time All-Stars, including Yankees catcher Jorge Posada.</p>
        <p>''I'm very emotional,'' Posada said, swallowing hard. ''I'm very excited. This is awesome. I can't tell you how good it feels.''</p>
        <p>The Mets left-hander Al Leiter and two other Yankees, shortstop Derek Jeter and the closer Mariano Rivera, were also named as reserves. Mets catcher Mike Piazza and Yankees outfielder Bernie Williams were elected as starters by fans.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo said he was gratified to make the team, especially considering the competition at second base. He said he had a feeling he would make it, based on the season he has had, and his brief stay atop the balloting at second base. His teammate and fellow native of Venezuela, shortstop Melvin Mora, said, ''It's about time.''</p>
        <p>''That's a tough position'' to choose from, Mora said. ''But if you see the kind of player Alfonzo is, he can do it all. He can play defense, walk, hit home runs, hit for average.''</p>
        <p>As a pitcher, Leiter has done it all for the Mets this year. The Mets are 14-2 when he starts, and Leiter said this is the best first half of his career. He said he could not help noticing that Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux will probably start Sunday, meaning Leiter could be the All-Star starter.</p>
        <p>''Making the All-Star team is one thing,'' said Leiter, who is 10-1 and has the league's best winning percentage. ''But to start is kind of a dream.''</p>
        <p>Leiter will be reunited with Cox, for whom he has a great appreciation. In 1996, when Leiter made his only other All-Star team, as a Florida Marlin, he was supposed to pitch only if the game went into extra innings. But the National League took a big lead, and Cox brought in Leiter from the bullpen to get the final out of the game.</p>
        <p>''I never forgot that,'' Leiter said. ''I stopped him and thanked him. He acted as if it wasn't that big a deal.''</p>
        <p>The Oakland closer Jason Isringhausen, who was traded by the Mets for pitcher Billy Taylor last July, was named to his first All-Star team, as was Milwaukee's Bob Wickman, who was traded by the Yankees in 1996 after spending nearly five years with the club.</p>
        <p>Other National League All-Star pitchers include Kevin Brown, Ryan Dempster, Tom Glavine, Trevor Hoffman, Randy Johnson, Darryl Kile, Greg Maddux and Shane Reynolds.</p>
        <p>Besides Alfonzo and Vidro, the N.L. reserves are Jason Kendall, Mike Lieberthal, Jeff Cirillo, Andres Galarraga, Todd Helton, Jim Edmonds, Brian Giles, Vladimir Guerrero, Andruw Jones and Gary Sheffield.</p>
        <p>Other American League pitchers include James Baldwin, Chuck Finley, Tim Hudson, Todd Jones, Derek Lowe, Aaron Sele and David Wells, the former Yankee, who could be the starting pitcher.</p>
        <p>Besides Jeter and Posada, the A.L. reserves are Carlos Delgado, Ray Durham, Travis Fryman, Nomar Garciaparra, Troy Glaus, Edgar Martinez, Fred McGriff, Mike Sweeney, Darin Erstad, Carl Everett, Matt Lawton and Magglio Ordonez.</p>
        <p>Torre's coaches are Seattle Manager Lou Piniella and Tampa Bay Manager Larry Rothschild, while Cox chose Houston's Larry Dierker and Arizona's Buck Showalter, the managers of the other division-winning N.L. teams in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, whose team played the Braves in last October's National League Championship Series, was not invited and has not been an All-Star coach since 1988.</p>
