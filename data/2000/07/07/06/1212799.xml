        <p>Editorial, commenting on upcoming Madrid meeting of representatives from industrialized countries and international organizations to discuss aid for Colombia, says well-financed European program with input from Colombian society can help to minimize chance that military aid will weaken civilian government, increase violence against peasants and harm peace process (S)</p>

        <p>In Madrid tomorrow, officials from industrialized nations and international organizations are meeting to discuss what, if anything, the rest of the world should do for Colombia now that Washington is giving it $1.3 billion -- much of it in the form of helicopters. The group, which is largely European, will not spend the money to match Washington's influence in Colombia. But a well-financed European program with input from Colombian society can help to minimize the chance that the military aid will weaken the civilian government, increase violence against peasants and harm the peace process.</p>
        <p>Although Washington's package does contain $200 million to strengthen Colombia's threadbare civilian government -- such as aiding the judicial system -- these programs could be crushed by an infusion of military aid at a time when the civilian leadership is dangerously weak. Military aid strengthens armies, and officers may become even more willing to defy the government.</p>

        <p>In Madrid tomorrow, officials from industrialized nations and international organizations are meeting to discuss what, if anything, the rest of the world should do for Colombia now that Washington is giving it $1.3 billion -- much of it in the form of helicopters. The group, which is largely European, will not spend the money to match Washington's influence in Colombia. But a well-financed European program with input from Colombian society can help to minimize the chance that the military aid will weaken the civilian government, increase violence against peasants and harm the peace process.</p>
        <p>Although Washington's package does contain $200 million to strengthen Colombia's threadbare civilian government -- such as aiding the judicial system -- these programs could be crushed by an infusion of military aid at a time when the civilian leadership is dangerously weak. Military aid strengthens armies, and officers may become even more willing to defy the government.</p>
        <p>The American package contains conditions that require respect for civilian rule. For example, officers must stop aiding the brutal paramilitary groups moving into the coca regions. The president, however, can waive these conditions on ''national security'' grounds. The Europeans should insist this waiver not be used, and they should make their own financial contribution to improving the justice system.</p>
        <p>Washington's aid also depends heavily on fumigation of coca-growing areas, possibly with a risky new biological agent, according to a report in today's Times by Tim Golden. Fumigation has driven coca production farther into the jungle and turned peasants into supporters of the guerrillas. European nations should finance pilot crop substitution projects, which could be more effective and lasting.</p>
        <p>Europe should also support the peace process, which may not survive a widening of the war. European nations should use their credibility with the guerrillas to emphasize the importance of ending kidnappings and coca trafficking. They can also finance development projects, which the Colombian government has endorsed and which can make peace talks more acceptable to the guerrillas. One of the biggest obstacles to peace is the guerrillas' fears that they will be massacred if they become civilian politicians -- the fate of thousands of former guerrillas in the mid-1980's. Europe should support human rights programs and strengthen the government's efforts to prosecute death squads.</p>
