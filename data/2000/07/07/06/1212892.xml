        <p>Phosphorus pollution has reached harmful levels in the reservoirs that supply New York City with its drinking water, two state officials said yesterday in calling for efforts to reduce the pollutant.</p>
        <p>Phosphorus, a pollutant from sewage, fertilizers, runoff and soaps, has been a growing problem, often forcing the city to shut down the flow from some reservoirs for months  during the summer and fall. It promotes algae blooms, causing discolored water that tastes and smells bad, and it triggers a chain reaction that can elevate toxic elements in water.</p>
        <p>The two officials, Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer and John P. Cahill, the commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, urged the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to tighten phosphorus pollution limits in the city's seven source reservoirs, which serve as the last stop before the water is sent to the city.</p>
        <p>''Ensuring that the level of phosphorus is low enough to permit the reservoirs to be used as a source of drinking water is critical,'' said Mr. Spitzer, who released his own report yesterday.</p>
        <p>The state is required to propose phosphorus limits to the federal government, which is required to rule on those limits.</p>
        <p>The officials urged that phosphorus limits be tightened by 25 percent. By law, the federal agency has 30 days to accept or reject the state's recommendation, which was released Friday by the D.E.C.</p>
        <p>The new recommendation is based mainly on scientific studies conducted last year by the city's Department of Environmental Protection, which urged the state in February to adopt a stricter standard.</p>
        <p>Previously, officials at the state environmental agency had said there was no need to tighten the standard of 20 micrograms per liter for the reservoirs east of the Hudson River, which are set to be filtered by 2007.</p>
        <p>However, the New Croton reservoir, which provides drinking water for about 900,000 people daily, is already severely affected by phosphorus at the current average level of 17 micrograms per liter, said James Tierney, the inspector general for the watershed. The attorney general and the state agency have recommended lowering the standard to 15.</p>
