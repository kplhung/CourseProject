        <p>The Cordiant Communications Group in London said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Lighthouse Global Network in Chicago, an international network of specialist communications and marketing businesses, for $592 million in stock and debt.</p>
        <p>Lighthouse has about 1,200 employees and revenue estimated at $158.9 million from clients like America Online and Microsoft.

        <p>The deal calls for Cordiant to issue 75 million additional shares, worth $421 million, and assume $171 million in Lighthouse debt. Lighthouse has been owned by its management and two private equity firms, GTCR Golder Rauner and the Frontenac Company. The deal is the second this week for Cordiant, coming after an agreement to acquire the business of Donino, White &amp; Partners in Atlanta, a technology agency with billings estimated at more than $100 million from clients like BellSouth.</p>
