        <p>With ceiling-to-floor slide projections and glossy press packets, the Pentagon described for reporters today how a mock warhead would thunder aloft on Friday night and a $30 million rocket would try to destroy it in a high-altitude collision.</p>
        <p>The exercise, the third and most demanding in a series of 19 tests for a national missile defense system, is to last 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>If it succeeds, unlike the previous one, President Clinton may order building the first phase of a $60 billion system to combat what his Administration has identified as threats from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. But if the warhead proceeds on course untouched, that would contribute to mounting criticism from scientists, experts on arms control and foreign policy and even some administration officials who doubt the wisdom and effectiveness of trying to build a system to protect American soil from missile attacks.</p>
        <p>In October, the Pentagon hailed its first test as a complete success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle had initially drifted off course and picked out the decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead. In a more complicated test in January, the kill vehicle missed the mock warhead by 300 to 400 feet after a cooling line had clogged and shut its heat-seeking sensors.</p>
        <p>The briefing today was not in the Pentagon press room, but in the Rossyln, Va., office of Boeing. With its three-year $2.4 billion contract, Boeing is the primary contractor for the program.</p>
        <p>If all goes according to the Pentagon plan, sometime between 10:01 p.m. Friday and 2:01 a.m. Saturday eastern time, the Pentagon would fire a 63-foot rocket with the mock warhead and a deflated Mylar balloon, to be a decoy, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., 125 miles north of Los Angeles. Five minutes later, officials said, the rocket would release its fake warhead, and the balloon decoy would inflate to more than 6 feet in diameter.</p>
        <p>About 15 minutes after that, a 54-inch 130-pound ''exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' would be launched from Kwajalein Atoll about 4,300 miles away in the Pacific Ocean and guide itself to a collision with the incoming mock warhead. If the kill vehicle finds and destroys the warhead, the sky will fill ''with a big flash,'' a Pentagon briefer said.</p>
        <p>This time a communications system has been added that would transmit information directly to the kill vehicle about the location of the target after it has lifted off.</p>
        <p>But critics say the test on Friday is grossly misleading because it is occurring under conditions that do not reflect those of a real attack. They also say that the so-called ''decoy'' is not really a decoy, but more like a lure that would attract the kill vehicle to the real target, and that an adversary would use not one, but many decoys. An adversary might even hide the warhead in a decoylike balloon, they say.</p>
        <p>There is one technical area that the Pentagon had not worked out in advance of the test. Reporters who want to watch a televised satellite feed will have to do so in the Boeing auditorium. ''The Pentagon just doesn't have the necessary equipment,'' a Pentagon official said.</p>
