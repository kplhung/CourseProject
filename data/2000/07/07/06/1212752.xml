        <p>A Michelangelo drawing sold for $12,378,500 on Tuesday at a Christie's auction in London, a record for a drawing by an old master. The drawing, which inspired his statue of the risen Christ, commissioned in 1514 for the Church of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva in Rome, was bought by Katrin Bellinger, a dealer based in Munich, from the estate of Sir Brinsley Ford, who bought it in 1936.</p>

        <p>A Michelangelo drawing sold for $12,378,500 on Tuesday at a Christie's auction in London, a record for a drawing by an old master.

        <p>Sing-Along</p>
        <p>The New York Choral Society opens its annual public open-reading series, ''Summer Sings,'' tonight at CAMI Hall on 165 West 57th Street in Manhattan, where David Randolph will lead a performance of Brahms's ''German'' Requiem. On Tuesdays and Thursdays through Aug. 22, members of the public who sing may attend these informal gatherings, where classical choral works are performed in a relaxed atmosphere. The doors open at 7 p.m.; the singing begins at 7:30.</p>
        <p>Arise, Sir 007</p>
        <p>Bond, James Bond, is now Sean, Sir Sean. The actor Sean Connery, who gained fame as the licensed-to-kill British agent 007 in the James Bond films, was knighted yesterday by Queen Elizabeth II at Holy rood Palace in his native Edinburgh. The knighthood was announced in the queen's New Year's Honors list, and yesterday's ceremony is the sole occasion in the year when the queen awards honors in Scotland. Wearing  the dark green MacLeod tartan of the Highlands, Sir Sean, 69, knelt while the queen touched his shoulders lightly with a sword and then rose and bowed as she placed a small red sash bearing his medal around his neck. The actor, a champion of Scottish nationalism and independence, said: ''It's one of the proudest days of my life. It means a great deal for it to happen in Scotland.''</p>
        <p>Shaping the World</p>
        <p>In the realm of fact and fancy that was the ancient art of map making, California was long depicted as an island. But cartographers were eager for information from shipmasters and explorers and preferred accuracy to rumor and imagination. After Columbus's voyages to the New World, global cartography underwent something of a renaissance. Beginning on Saturday, more than 40 antique maps and sea charts demonstrating the progressive shaping of the continents and seas go on display through Oct. 1 in ''Earth's Elusive Shores: The Art of Mapping After 1500'' at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
