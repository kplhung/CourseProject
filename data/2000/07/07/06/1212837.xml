        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>DEMOCRATS REJECT TOBACCO DONATIONS  Tobacco money is not welcome by the host committee that is raising $35 million for the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month. Noelia Rodriguez, chief executive of the committee, yesterday decided not to accept or solicit donations from any tobacco company or its subsidiaries. This comes at a time when the committee is still $3 million to $4 million short of its fund-raising target. ''We look forward to showcasing Los Angeles as the largest smoke-free city in the nation,'' Ms. Rodriguez said. Philip Morris, one of the nation's largest tobacco companies, has given $250,000 to the Philadelphia host committee for the Republican National Convention, which begins on July 31.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>KENNEDY CHALLENGER PRESSES ON  Jack E. Robinson III, the beleaguered Republican challenger to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, is going down swinging in this fall's Senate election in Massachusetts. Mr. Robinson, an entrepreneur, yesterday appealed a decision by the state ballot law commission last week that he lacked the 10,000 qualifying signatures he needed to run because some of those he submitted had been forged and some were printed upside down. Taking his case to the highest court in the state, he challenged the decision that 129 signatures were invalid. If the State Supreme Judicial Court upholds his removal from the ballot, Massachusetts will lack a Republican candidate for a Senate seat for the first time, political experts say.</p>

        <p>THE RULES</p>
        <p>CHURCHES AND CHARITIES WARNED  The Internal Revenue Service issued an election-year warning yesterday that churches, charities and many other tax-exempt organizations should not engage in political activities encouraging support for or opposition to any candidates. The organizations involved are exempt from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code. ''These organizations cannot endorse any candidates, make donations to their campaigns, engage in fund-raising, distribute statements or become involved in any other activities that may be beneficial or detrimental to any candidate,'' the I.R.S. statement said. The agency said organizations could lose their tax-exempt status or be subjected to an excise tax on the political money spent.</p>
