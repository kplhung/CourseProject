        <p>Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman, buys his in Spain. In London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop over -- or rather under -- the Channel to France for his. In Berlin, Monika Brauer, a German, prefers to buy hers in Poland.</p>
        <p>What these border hoppers have in common is the quest for (relatively) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to cross international frontiers just to fill the tank is an often wide difference in gasoline taxes, one of Europe's most pervasive yet surreptitious taxes. For some Europeans, it's an offer they can't seem to refuse.</p>
        <p>In some countries that share a border, a bridge or a tunnel, the difference in the price of gas can be substantial.</p>
        <p>A driver in Britain, where fuel can cost $5.50 a gallon, can save as much as $1.80 a gallon by tanking up in France. Germans can pay $3.70 a gallon -- or seek out gas in Poland for 75 cents less. The difference is explained by taxes.</p>
        <p>Wedded to their cars, the Continent's motorists have long been the target of governments that seek revenues by cranking up levies on gasoline rather than confront the political repercussions of higher sales and income taxes.</p>
        <p>''Some people now pay more duty on petrol than they do income tax,'' said Britain's conservative tabloid The Daily Mail. ''This is stealth tax with a vengeance.''</p>
        <p>In parts of the United States, price increases have pushed gasoline past the $2 mark. But in Europe, the combination of similar increases and sales taxes have put prices at levels that stagger even Europeans, and would incense Americans.</p>
        <p>''If anyone in the United States were told to pay the prices we pay here, there'd be rioting in the streets,'' said Michael Johnson, a spokesman for Britain's Automobile Association.</p>
        <p>The prices offer some insight into a yawning chasm in trans-Atlantic perceptions of the little guy's relationships with the big guys. While Americans protest vocally at gasoline prices climbing past $1.50 a gallon, Britons sigh in grumpy resignation at gas costing more than three times as much.</p>
        <p>While the perceived rapacity of Big Oil has become a campaign issue in the United States, Europeans exude a despairing rage at what seems to be a conspiracy between political parties whose rivalries give way to a consensus on the beauty of gasoline taxes and the riches they produce for those in power.</p>
        <p>For every gallon sold at the pumps in French francs or German marks or British pounds, European governments rake in an average 70 percent to 80 percent of the price, compared to 25 percent in America.</p>
        <p>So, at a time when the European Union is ballyhooing its single market and single currency, the discrepancies between tax regimes, both within the European Union and beyond, are providing the little guy one of the very few chances to profit from Europe's deep-rooted national distinctions.</p>
        <p>Even though France and Spain share the euro, for instance, Mr. Cheringou, a hotel receptionist in the French resort of St.-Jean-de-Luz likes to head south over the France-Spain border in his Peugeot 106 subcompact every 10 days on a mission to buy gas, cigarettes, fresh fruit and fish.</p>
        <p>A 20-minute drive from the Hotel Prado where he works, he said, Spanish entrepreneurs have thoughtfully erected a gigantic supermarket, the Alcampo, to cater to him and thousands of other French shoppers, with prices both in French francs and Spanish pesetas. Because of an agreement between some European countries removing border formalities, there is no need to slow down or show his passport as he crosses the border.</p>
        <p>The trip is well worth his drive. He figures that with the $80 he spends on a 10-gallon tank of gas, a few cartons of Winfield cigarettes and a grocery cart of produce, he saves about $30 from what he would otherwise pay in France -- the equivalent of more than $1,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The reason, he said, is that while gas costs seven French francs per liter -- roughly $3.70 per gallon -- in France, the cost in Spain is significantly less because taxes are lower. Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, French taxes account for roughly 70 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas in France, while Spanish taxes total about 60 percent.</p>
        <p>The distinctions exist not just within the 11 countries that have adopted the euro to underpin their national coin. In non-euro England, for instance, where taxes consume about 75 percent of gas prices, Mr. Reddy, a 45-year-old security consultant, figures he will save more than $3,000 a year simply by doing monthly shopping not at his local stores in East London but in France.</p>
        <p>Taking his Alfa Romeo 164 sports sedan to France, he says, costs him little more than the $37.50 day ticket to use the Channel Tunnel.</p>
        <p>But, because French taxes on gasoline, tobacco, liquor and food are so much lower, his savings far outstrip the price of the ticket. ''I go because of the ludicrous high taxes on everything we do, buy, eat or sleep in Britain,'' he said. ''If we didn't have these ludicrous, high taxes, I wouldn't go over there.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said, up until three years ago French gasoline prices were higher than British prices. But since then -- coinciding with Tony Blair's New Labor government -- gas prices have risen by more than a third in Britain. ''I'd say that, in the last three years, 99 per cent of my fuel has been French,'' Mr. Reddy said.</p>
        <p>In Berlin, Mrs. Brauer, a 55-year-old hospital administrator, has gone one further. For many years, she said, she has kept a weekend home in a trailer park on the German-Polish border at Frankfurt an der Oder, 50 miles away.</p>
        <p>In Germany, gasoline, laden with ecological and sales taxes, costs $3.59 per gallon. In Poland, she said, it costs 20 percent less. So, during her weekend at the trailer, Mrs. Brauer does some of her shopping by fueling her Opel Vectra compact -- and buying a carton of cheaper cigarettes -- in Poland, for a savings of about $500 a year.</p>
        <p>''Why should I pay more taxes in Germany?'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of course, not every European lives close to a border, so the economic impact of those shopping for cheaper gas is minor. But the crossborder odysseys play into a much bigger debate over the environment, the economy and, increasingly, the Continent's politics just at a time when summer vacationers take to the autobahns.</p>
        <p>By tradition, this is a time of debates and migrations, when Germans head to Italy, and French vacationers swarm the Riviera and Britons drive across the English Channel.</p>
        <p>It is a time when European environmentalists fret about auto pollution and, this year, some politicians have begun to see the risk to their constituencies presented by ever-higher gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>In big economic terms, the case for high gasoline taxes is not easy to resolve.</p>
        <p>Higher gas prices spread increased costs across Europe's economies, pushing up delivery and supply charges.</p>
        <p>Yet, according to Fatih Birol, the head of economic analysis at the International Energy Agency, the high proportion of taxes in the pump price of Europe's gasoline effectively fixes so much of the price of gasoline that consumers are cushioned from the wild price swings Americans have seen this year.</p>
        <p>And governments argue that motorists should pay for the damage they cause to the environment. ''It's sort of enshrined in environmental policy to persuade people to use alternative means of transport,'' said Vicky Sheriff, a spokeswoman for the British Treasury.</p>
        <p>For all those high-minded protestations, the reality is that gas taxes produce significant income for governments that is difficult to find elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In Britain, gasoline taxes and license fees net more than $55 billion a year, roughly the same as Germany's gas tax revenue.</p>
        <p>Of course, the high price of crude oil and the strength of the dollar -- the currency of the oil industry -- have also pushed up prices. Significantly, though, the latest increases have finally nudged prices toward psychological barriers -- 2 German marks per liter or $3.70 per gallon, and 1 pound per liter or $5.50 a gallon in Britain -- that may breach European apathy about gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>Still, some Europeans sense that their love affair with their cars leaves them vulnerable to ever higher prices.</p>
        <p>''In France people will sacrifice even on food rather than do without their car,'' said Mr. Cheringou in St.-Jean-de-Luz.</p>
        <p>''They keep slapping on the tax and all we do is sit at home and moan about it,'' said Mr. Reddy in London.</p>
        <p>''You can do anything you want with the Germans because they won't leave their car at home,'' said Mrs. Brauer in Berlin. ''The car is their favorite child.''</p>
