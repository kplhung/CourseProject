        <p>Tiger Woods confirmed today that he will not play in next year's Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship, which will be held Jan. 3-7 in Australia. The event, which is limited to the top 64 players in the world ranking, has been held in California the past two years, but many players are reluctant to make the long journey to Australia right after New Year's Day.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to the match play,'' said Woods, who was defeated by Darren Clarke in this year's championship match. ''I have a pretty hectic schedule at the end of the year. I believe I'm playing eight straight weeks, all around the world.''</p>

        <p>Woods admitted that PGA Tour officials were upset with his decision to skip the event.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has spoken to me about it,'' said Woods, who will defend his title at the Advil Western Open, which begins here Thursday. ''That's the way it goes sometimes. I'm not the only one, though.''</p>
