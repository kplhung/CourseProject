        <p>The Knicks have read the newspaper articles detailing Grant Hill's infatuation with the Orlando Magic, but they are not yet ready to concede defeat.

        <p>The Knicks have read the newspaper articles detailing Grant Hill's infatuation with the Orlando Magic, but they are not yet ready to concede defeat. Despite reports that Hill is ''leaning strongly'' toward joining the Magic and that he and his wife, Tamia, went house hunting in central Florida on Monday, the Knicks, as one member of the organization put it, continue to ''keep hope alive.''</p>
        <p>''You don't know if what's coming out is accurate,'' the person in the Knicks organization said. ''I'm sure Grant liked what he saw down there -- the money and the other stuff. But he's probably going to talk to San Antonio and he'll probably talk to us. I would say he's probably going to Orlando, but you never know; he could change his mind.''</p>
        <p>What is certain is that Hill will not return to Detroit. In comments made to reporters in Orlando and Detroit, he consistently referred to his relationship with the Pistons in the past tense, and several executives around the league and a person close to Hill said the sixth-year veteran has ruled out remaining with the Pistons.</p>
        <p>The feeling is that Hill will go to Orlando. In fact, some executives believe a deal had already been reached in principle before Hill visited the Magic last weekend.</p>
        <p>Hill has said that his decision will not be based on what San Antonio's Tim Duncan does, but if Duncan decides against joining the Magic, Hill would potentially be placing himself in a situation similar to the mediocrity he experienced in Detroit. While the Magic would have the money to add another star -- it met with Tracy McGrady yesterday, and the Toronto forward has said Orlando is his first choice -- the team would have trouble landing a top-flight big man to complement Hill's perimeter skills and make the team a legitimate championship contender.</p>
        <p>John Gabriel, Orlando's general manager, said he will not relax until Hill has signed a contract.</p>
        <p>''I think we have a good chance but we've still got a little ways to go,'' Gabriel said when reached by telephone yesterday. ''You're always going to be concerned until something's signed in August.''</p>
        <p>Free agents cannot sign contracts with clubs until Aug. 1. One league executive said the Knicks would be Hill's team of choice if he does not go to Orlando. Hill is said to like New York because, in addition to playing with one of the Eastern Conference's best teams, he would be in a city that would provide his wife, who is a recording artist, with excellent opportunities in the music industry.</p>
        <p>Hill's fondness for Detroit and professed loyalty to the Pistons organization could work in the Knicks' favor. If he wants to help the Pistons, Hill could agree to a sign-and-trade deal rather than go to Orlando as a free agent and leave Detroit with nothing in return.</p>
        <p>Orlando is not in good position to work a sign-and-trade deal with the Pistons because it has nothing but future draft picks to offer. The Knicks, on the other hand, might part with Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby if it means acquiring Hill.</p>
        <p>Fortson a Good Fit</p>
        <p>The Knicks seem to be in prime position to acquire Danny Fortson, the hard-working rebounder for the Boston Celtics. Raymond Brothers, the agent for Fortson, said the Knicks are the top choice for his client, who is a free agent.</p>
        <p>The Knicks would have to pull off a sign-and-trade deal with the Celtics. Boston has reportedly offered Fortson a seven-year deal worth $31 million. Chris Childs would probably be the player the Knicks choose to move, but because of base-year compensation issues, the Celtics would have to send another player, perhaps Greg Minor or Eric Williams, to New York along with Fortson.</p>
        <p>While Fortson is a power forward, his presence would not preclude the Knicks from re-signing Kurt Thomas, a person in the organization said. Having both players would give the Knicks the type of inside toughness they lacked during the postseason.</p>
        <p>Summer Camp Competition</p>
        <p>Frederick Weis is one of 21 players who will begin vying for spots on the Knicks' summer camp roster next week. The Knicks will join Milwaukee, New Jersey, San Antonio, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, Indiana, Washington and Atlanta in the Boston summer league from July 17-24.</p>
        <p>The invited players are: the point guards Rick Brunson, Shaheen Holloway, Mark Baker, Louis Bullock and Kiwane Garris; the shooting guards Lavor Postell, James Collins and Marcus Wilson; the small forwards Pete Mickeal, Damous Anderson, Joe Courtney and Jason Sasser; the power forwards Ivano Newbill, Jamie Arnold, Ashraf Amaya and Randell Jackson; and centers Weis, John Coker, Peter Aluma, Jonathon Kerner and Jason Lawson.</p>
