        <p>With repairs scheduled to begin this weekend on parts of Newark International Airport's ailing monorail system, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a plan today to use 57 new buses and vans, as well as 200 new employees and an extensive system of signs, to ease travelers through the disruption.</p>
        <p>On Labor Day, the monorail system, which serves 30,000 people a day at the nation's eighth largest airport, will close for three months for the repair work, and the buses and vans will be the only airport-provided transport between terminals, rental car sites and outlying parking locations.</p>

        <p>With repairs scheduled to begin this weekend on parts of Newark International Airport's ailing monorail system, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced a plan today to use 57 new buses and vans, as well as 200 new employees and an extensive system of signs, to ease travelers through the disruption.</p>
        <p>On Labor Day, the monorail system, which serves 30,000 people a day at the nation's eighth largest airport, will close for three months for the repair work, and the buses and vans will be the only airport-provided transport between terminals, rental car sites and outlying parking locations.</p>
        <p>But for now, the sections of the four-year-old, 1.9-mile-long rail system that will be the immediate focus of repairs and service disruptions are at the far ends of the line, which serve parking and car rental sites. Monorail service among the airport's three main passenger terminals and some closer locations will not be affected, said John S. Jacoby, assistant director of airport operations for the Port Authority, which operates the airport.</p>
        <p>The repairs became necessary after service was disrupted for five days in January, when the system's operator discovered that a design flaw had caused water to accumulate and damage the heating elements that were supposed to prevent icing in winter on the system's single rail.</p>
        <p>The repairs, which are expected to cost $25 million, will be paid for by ADtranz, the Pittsburgh-based division of Daimler-Chrysler that operates the $354 million monorail.</p>
        <p>The cost of the temporary bus service, signs, additional employees and advertising and marketing is estimated at $9 million, and Port Authority officials are still in negotiations with the monorail operator over who will pay.</p>
        <p>Bright orange signs have already started to appear at the airport, informing travelers of the new ''Monorail Bypass'' arrangements that will start this weekend. Airlines are expected to make on-board announcements of the disruption to their arriving passengers, and computerized systems used by many travel agents will carry alerts about the changes. Local radio stations will also broadcast announcements about the disruptions, encouraging travelers to plan for up to 30 minutes' more time spent traveling in and around the airport.</p>
        <p>The new white buses and vans, emblazoned with the words ''Monorail Bypass'' in bright orange letters, will be driven by 80 new bus drivers and scheduled to run at five-minute intervals, Mr. Jacoby said. The longest travel time that anyone is likely to have from getting onto the bus to getting off at the destination is estimated to be 24 minutes, and that will be at peak travel times between 4 P.M. and 5 P.M. after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>About 80 additional customer service representatives dressed in their trademark bright red blazers will be put on duty to assist travelers in making their way to and from the temporary bus services. And more than 40 supervisors and support workers will be added as well, Mr. Jacoby said.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority's complex plan to make up for the disruptions caused by the monorail repairs and closing was developed over the last few months in meetings with airport tenants, including airlines, rental car agencies and hotel shuttle bus operations, said Gregory Trevor, a spokesman for the authority.</p>
        <p>Many of those tenants, suggesting that the ground transportation disruptions were not likely to help the image of the airport, which ranked dead last in on-time flights in seven of the last eight years, said they were nevertheless pleased that the Port Authority was waiting until after the peak travel times for the full shutdown of the system. One airline spokesman recalled that tenants had depended on a bus system similar to the emergency temporary arrangements before the construction of the monorail.</p>
