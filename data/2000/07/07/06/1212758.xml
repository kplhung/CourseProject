        <p>THE first thing one needs to know about upgrading to the new Windows Millennium Edition operating system -- besides the fact that PC makers plan to offer it on new home computers this summer and that Microsoft will make it available as an upgrade for older computers in September -- is that the Uninstall routine is inside the Commands folder, which is tucked inside the Windows folder.</p>
        <p>Actually, the first thing one needs to know is that Windows Me is an interesting but hardly crucial upgrade for Windows 98, with a bunch of clever new features intended to make home computers easier and more fun to use. And if Windows Me is factory-installed on a new computer, it will almost certainly make the computer faster to boot up, more reliable, easier to connect to other computers and to the Internet and much more entertaining and versatile in the areas of music and video.</p>
        <p>Windows Me was sent to PC manufacturers two weeks ago, and new home PC's will start showing up any day now with it already installed. The do-it-yourself upgrade package will go on sale in computer stores on Sept. 14 with a suggested price of $109 and a probable street price of $90.</p>
        <p>But based on my recent experience with five Windows computers, two Windows Me upgrade discs supplied by Microsoft and a hot line connection to a friendly Microsoft technical support specialist named Don, I think I'll skip this upgrade and wait to take advantage of the new operating system the next time I buy a new PC.</p>
        <p>The arrival of Windows Me is a great reminder that an operating system upgrade is not to be undertaken casually, especially if there are other ways to improve a computer's performance without tampering with its most fundamental code. An operating system has powerful juju, and running afoul of it calls down the wrath of the computer spirits.</p>
        <p>Microsoft describes Windows Me as ''an initial step towards delivering on Microsoft's vision for home users.'' Unlike the new Windows 2000 operating system, which was built atop a foundation of industrial-strength code written for business and corporate computers, Windows Millennium Edition is a direct descendant of Windows 95 and 98. It is a remodeling project, in other words. Microsoft is already hard at work creating the next step in its consumer operating system strategy  (Windows Me Two?) but for now Windows Me is Microsoft's best operating system for home PC's.</p>
        <p>And that is a scary thought.</p>
        <p>Of the five computers I tried to upgrade, only one accepted the new software without a fight. On that machine, Windows Me performed flawlessly and revealed its many good features, which fall into four main categories.</p>
        <p>The first is digital media and entertainment. It has a snazzy new Windows Media Player and a digital movie-making feature that is similar to the one Apple has had on its iMacs for the past year. Windows Me makes it easier to work with digital picture and music files. It also comes with more games, including online games that let players insult one another verbally with a feature called DirectPlay Voice.</p>
        <p>I especially like the built-in support for copying audio CD's to the hard drive, and for transferring those digital music files to a portable MP3 player like the Diamond Rio.</p>
        <p>The second category is home networking. The number of homes with two or more computers is growing rapidly, but getting the computers to share files, printers and Internet connections has not been easy. Windows Me has new software wizards that help the user set up home networks. It adds support for high-speed IEEE 1394 (Firewire) peripheral connections, and it improves the support for instant messaging and streaming audio and video.</p>
        <p>Microsoft calls the third category the ''online experience,'' which includes everything from a new version of Internet Explorer (IE 5.5) to new network plumbing borrowed from Windows 2000. Windows Me does a better job of handling cable and D.S.L. Internet connections, and it has better support for online chat sessions and conferencing.</p>
        <p>The fourth and most important category is called PC Health -- an odd name, as it turned out, given the woes I had trying to install Me.</p>
        <p>Windows Me has been fortified with features intended to make the operating system more stable and reliable and able to fix its own technical problems. It is also designed to shield the consumer from accidentally overwriting esoteric system files, to simplify Microsoft's notoriously cryptic error messages and to restore the computer to a state of health if something does go wrong.</p>
        <p>One new feature is System File Protection, which keeps newly installed applications from either accidentally or deliberately messing around with system files, including the treacherous little rascals known as DLL's, or dynamic link libraries. Conversely, another new feature, System Restore, allows the user to beat a retreat in case something does go awry during the installation of new software or hardware.</p>
        <p>The Help system has been completely redesigned and expanded to include both online and disk-based support and troubleshooting.</p>
        <p>And, oh, did I need help.</p>
        <p>The first disastrous attempt to load Windows Me on my I.B.M. Thinkpad 240 reinforced Computing Rule No. 1: Never attempt an operating system upgrade without first making a backup of important files.</p>
        <p>It also underscored the importance of clicking ''yes'' when the installation routine asks if the user wants to squirrel away a copy of the computer's existing Windows configuration, just in case, and ''yes'' again to make an emergency boot diskette, just in case the new operating system causes the computer to have a grand mal seizure.</p>
        <p>Even after what the computer wizards call a clean install, which involves bypassing the earlier version of Windows on the machine, and after laboriously shutting down every program or software routine that might conflict with the installation of a new operating system, Windows Me still fought with some unknown software antagonist on my laptop.</p>
        <p>Despite claims that Windows Me has simplified the error messages, it still spit out such gems as ''Rundll32 has caused an error in</p>
        <p>The only way to regain use of the computer was to uninstall Me.</p>
        <p>New error messages popped up when I tried to install Windows Me on a Dell desktop computer. After two more installation attempts, and two more uninstalls, the new software took residence but reported ''script errors'' that blanked every file menu and directory screen.</p>
        <p>Attempts to get Windows Me installed on a third computer, also a Dell, succeeded only after I erased most of my favorite applications from the hard disk. From then on, Windows Me worked like a champ.</p>
        <p>A fourth computer choked when Windows Me tried to commandeer nearly 500 megabytes of disk space. Microsoft says the minimum requirement is 320 megabytes of free space, but a clean install can chew up half a gigabyte.</p>
        <p>The fifth computer, a nearly virginal laptop computer, absorbed Windows Me without a hitch on the first try. This suggests strongly that the problems on other machines arose from conflicts between Me and one or more other programs, even though the applications were closed.</p>
        <p>On the machines where it took root, Windows Me was a welcome improvement over Windows 98 Second Edition. But unless you have an urgent need for the new features, it is probably a good idea to wait, at least until Microsoft finds and fixes potential software conflicts.</p>
