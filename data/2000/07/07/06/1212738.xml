        <p>''With the Internet, printed pieces were supposed to go away, but I think people still like to  feel the texture of paper,'' said David Shearer, who owns Totem, a home furnishings shop in SoHo. So he also edits a magazine-catalog, DSGN, left, ($5.95). The current issue profiles the  designers Marc Newson and Karim Rashid, whose products are at Totem.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco-based magazine Dwell ($4.95), right, will make its debut next month. Its focus is on how people and their dogs and children really live in modern homes, occasionally with nonstylish furniture. ''Sometimes the clunky furniture makes the architecture more interesting,'' said Karrie Jacobs, the editor in chief and former architecture columnist at New York magazine.</p>

        <p>Hush magazine comes from the neatnik company California Closets. ''If we've simplified your life, then Hush gives you five minutes more to spend with your children or garden,'' said Edward Leaman, the editorial director. The latest issue has an article about Topher Delaney, a landscape architect,  and, oh yes, also one about the company's London showroom.</p>
