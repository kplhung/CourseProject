        <p>Preview of Missile Defense Test  The Pentagon described how a mock warhead is to thunder aloft tomorrow night and how a $30 million rocket will try to destroy it in a high-altitude collision. If the test succeeds, President Clinton may order the building of the first phase of a $60 billion system to defend American soil from missile attacks.</p>

        <p>Sierra Leone Diamond Ban  The Security Council voted to impose a worldwide ban on the purchase of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone until its government can establish a system to certify the origin of stones being exported and begins to assert its authority over the diamond fields.

        <p>Slight, and Rare, Decline In California Prison Rolls  The California state prison system, which led the huge national prison-building boom for years, has recorded its first decline in inmate population in more than two decades, to 161,401 inmates in June, 360 fewer than in June 1999. The drop, though tiny, has already caused some officials to say it is time for California to suspend its prison buildup.</p>

        <p>A Vote for Impeachment  A committee of New Hampshire lawmakers voted to recommend that the full House impeach Chief Justice David Brock of the State Supreme Court based on accusations that he had committed perjury as he defended himself against charges of ethical improprieties.
