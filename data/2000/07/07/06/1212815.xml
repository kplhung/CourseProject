        <p>In the strongest sign that he intends to raise character and integrity as an issue in the Senate race, Representative Rick A. Lazio says in a new fund-raising letter that Hillary Rodham Clinton and President Clinton ''have embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts.''</p>
        <p>The letter, which went out this week and is signed by Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee, does not specify what he believes Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, or the president have done.</p>
        <p>In a news briefing held on a bus that was carrying reporters traveling with him on his cross-state campaign tour this week, Mr. Lazio would not elaborate. He said many such letters pass across his desk and he needed to review this one before elaborating on it.</p>
        <p>''Frankly these letters are written not by me,'' Mr. Lazio said, adding, ''I'm not disowning it.''</p>
        <p>The letter, in asking for contributions, includes the line, ''If you're like most Republicans you believe that Hillary Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, it says, ''covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how other people run their lives. No other Senate hopeful enjoys a liberal national press that hangs on her every word and treats her never-ending soap opera of scandals as 'irrelevant' and 'yesterday's news.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also describes himself as a conservative and Mrs. Clinton as a liberal, although both campaigns have tried to claim the political center.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, through a spokesman, called the letter a ''personal insult.'' But Mr. Lazio defended the letter, saying he needed to strike back after Mrs. Clinton began broadcasting a series of negative television advertisements a couple of weeks ago. And he continued to tell supporters at public rallies that he would wage a positive campaign.</p>
        <p>Asked to reconcile the letter with his promise to stay positive, Mr. Lazio drew a distinction between television advertising and letters to supporters. The letter, he said, ''is not part of a mass communication.''</p>
        <p>''I just think it's a totally different situation,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''Our campaign is not focused on the negative; their campaign is completely focused on the negative.''</p>
        <p>''It's not what you send to some House donor list that matters,'' Mr. Lazio said as questions about the letter came to dominate his 23-minute session with reporters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio steadfastly refused to give examples of the conduct he deemed offensive, but the letter seemed a reference to a string of scandals, including the Monica Lewinsky matter and a series of investigations into Mrs. Clinton's law practice, the Whitewater land deal and her handling of firings in the White House travel office. Mr. Lazio voted in 1998 to impeach the president on two of four articles.</p>
        <p>Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said, ''We are confident that New Yorkers will reject Rick Lazio's campaign of personal insults in favor of Hillary's campaign of issue-related differences and real ideas.''</p>
        <p>He took issue with Mr. Lazio's drawing a distinction between what is said on the campaign trail and what is said in fund-raising letters. ''It's time for him to take responsibility for his campaign of personal attacks and insults,'' Mr. Wolfson said.</p>
        <p>Fund-raising letters, whether released through a candidate's office or by a third party, often employ stronger language than a candidate uses in campaign appearances or advertisements. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, when he was considering a run for the Senate this year, took criticism for a letter written by a conservative group on his behalf that characterized Mrs. Clinton as a radical liberal who was anti-religion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, whose tour today included a visit to a child care training center in Plattsburgh and a farm in Burke, in recent days has begun referring to character and integrity as factors that voters should consider in choosing a Senate candidate.</p>
