        <p>Maybe it was the effect of the holiday, but the hip-hop show at the Knitting Factory on Tuesday night unfurled as slowly as an afternoon barbecue. The crowd was sparse on this second night of the bill, and the mood was, as Snoop Doggy Dogg says, laid back.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was the effect of the holiday, but the hip-hop show at the Knitting Factory on Tuesday night unfurled as slowly as an afternoon barbecue. The crowd was sparse on this second night of the bill, and the mood was, as Snoop Doggy Dogg says, laid back.</p>
        <p>The casual flow made it easy to see how these artists fit into one of underground hip-hop's liveliest backyards: the roster of Goodvibes Recordings, a label based in Berkeley, Calif., now being distributed by Atomic Pop, the Internet-friendly company that has also lured Public Enemy into a new career phase.</p>
        <p>This was a gathering of underground hip-hop fans who assess one another in terms of knowledge and skills, not designer clothes and fat wallets. Befitting the scene's do-it-yourself attitude, the audience began the night's festivities. Four men took advantage of an empty space in the middle of the dance floor to break dance, challenging one another with rapid splits and head spins.</p>
        <p>After the dancers warmed up the room, the New Jersey crew Nuthouse emerged, as friendly as the first guests at the grill. The group's two rappers, El da Sensei and Sak One, amiably offered lyrics about loving hip-hop and earning respect, spiced up with a speedy dance hall flavor. Nuthouse broke the ice most successfully with a rap based around the phrase ''fuhgeddaboutit,'' as most recently made popular by another New Jersey crew, ''The Sopranos'' of HBO.</p>
        <p>Next came another long D.J. break and the arrival of two members of the venerable hip-hop crew Zulu Nation, upping the party's cool quotient.</p>
        <p>Finally the Los Angeles rapper Spontaneous bounded out. Here was the crazy, entertaining guest every good bash needs. Rhyming with an elastic mouth slightly reminiscent of DMX, Spontaneous mugged as he asserted his prowess, getting the crowd excited by holding up call-and-response signs and even jumping into its midst. His D.J., Kid Dragon, spun in a comically spooky fashion that suited this modern-day Screamin' Jay Hawkins.</p>
        <p>After another D.J. break the Philadelphia rapper Bahamadia took the party into another room. This gifted wordsmith resembled the smart young woman who commandeers the kitchen for some serious discussion over the dessert plate. Her preacherly voice gave authority to raps calling for more uplifting media images and greater self-respect among female hip-hop fans.</p>
        <p>Bahamadia lent weight to her feminist words by inviting Big Tara of the Brooklyn crew the Anomolies onstage, along with an unidentified audience member who nearly matched her sisters in rhyming skills. This female freestyling session was a highlight of the show.</p>
        <p>Soon enough, though, Slum Village grabbed the mood and turned it, crashing onto the stage like the football team arriving at the keg. This Detroit crew is very popular in the underground, and the audience members jumped and yelled along with the jovial, rhythmically complex raps. ''We're the firecracker tonight!'' announced the rapper T3 as his partner, Baatin, mugged in the grand tradition of Louis Jordan. With rhymes detailing sexual encounters and berating other rappers for being jealous, this obnoxious but undeniably charismatic group made the party its own.</p>
        <p>The audience was drifting out by the time Cali Agents (who record for Ground Control Records) emerged, sealing the evening's mood with an old-school display of strength. Like the last guests lingering in the living room, the rappers Rasco and Planet Asia brought the conversation home with classic verses about integrity and community spirit. ''I came to give your spirit and your mind back,'' said Planet Asia as he left the stage. That's what any successful Independence Day celebration does.</p>
