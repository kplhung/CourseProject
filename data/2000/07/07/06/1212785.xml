        <p>Like everybody in Fort Lee who lives in a high-rise apartment, my family and I hosted a big Fourth of July party on Tuesday. The highlight was to be the parade of tall ships up the Hudson River, and the view from our building on the Palisades promised to be spectacular.</p>
        <p>At 11:30 a.m., we poured Champagne and sang ''Happy Birthday''  to America. Then my guests, with cameras and binoculars in hand, began going out onto the terrace to catch a first glimpse of the tall ships.</p>

        <p>Like everybody in Fort Lee who lives in a high-rise apartment, my family and I hosted a big Fourth of July party on Tuesday. The highlight was to be the parade of tall ships up the Hudson River, and the view from our building on the Palisades promised to be spectacular.</p>
        <p>At 11:30 a.m., we poured Champagne and sang ''Happy Birthday''  to America. Then my guests, with cameras and binoculars in hand, began going out onto the terrace to catch a first glimpse of the tall ships.</p>
        <p>It was not long before they saw  that the ships were turning around well downstream from the George Washington Bridge, at about the level of West 54th Street in Manhattan. I couldn't believe it.</p>
        <p>For over a year, Fort Lee's chief of police, Thomas Tessaro, had been meeting with his counterparts from across Bergen and Hudson Counties to coordinate security and logistics for OpSail 2000. Also represented at these meetings were the Port Authority, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, the F.B.I. and the New Jersey State Police. At each meeting, the plan was for the ships to make their turn under the George Washington Bridge or just north of it, with the first ship arriving at around noon and the parade continuing until roughly 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>As my guests drifted away in disappointment, I tried to get an explanation. The Coast Guard bounced me from one person to another. Someone who identified himself as a ''traffic manager for the harbor'' tried to pass off responsibility to Ocean Spray, the corporate sponsor.  (Ocean Spray, which I reached on Wednesday, said it had only put up the money to help produce the event and not been involved in its operation.)</p>
        <p>Across Fort Lee there was profound disappointment. At Historic Park, overlooking the George Washington Bridge, people had gathered since early in the morning, and we had arranged for extra police officers, fire brigades and our ambulance corps to be on duty to handle the crowds. There was similar inconvenience and disappointment in our neighboring towns in New Jersey as well as in upper Manhattan, where thousands of New Yorkers gathered in Riverside Park, in Riverbank State Park, and on the streets of Washington Heights.</p>
        <p>The official explanation now seems to be that the tide was unfavorable. But this event was planned more than a year in advance; surely someone must have consulted the nautical tables. And even if the weather conditions had taken organizers by surprise on Tuesday morning, why were public officials not informed immediately? At least then we could have passed the news to the families at the river before they settled in for the day.</p>
        <p>Another 15 minutes of sailing by each ship would have given thousands of people, many of them children, a memory to last a lifetime. Would that have been too much to ask?</p>
