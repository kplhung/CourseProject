        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You say a recent quiz on American history exposed a ''sobering'' lack of knowledge on the part of college seniors (Week in Review, July 2). Having graduated this spring, I appreciated the chance to take the test myself. And while I'm happy to report that I scored above the 53 percent average, I think the results speak more to the evolution of higher education than to its degradation.</p>

        <p>You say a recent quiz on American history exposed a ''sobering'' lack of knowledge on the part of college seniors (Week in Review, July 2). Having graduated this spring, I appreciated the chance to take the test myself. And while I'm happy to report that I scored above the 53 percent average, I think the results speak more to the evolution of higher education than to its degradation.</p>
        <p>In the modern world, with its explosion of science and technology, the only alternative to specialization seems to be shallow knowledge. There is simply too much to know. This puts the assumption of an ''essential'' body of knowledge, like American history, in serious jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Thus, it's old-fashioned to judge the depth of our students' educations by their familiarity with one subject. A century ago, college students were expected to master courses in classical rhetoric. The world of 1925 would have been shocked at its college seniors' inability to identify the use of litotes or synecdoche.</p>
        <p>In another 25 years, we'll be appalled at how little our students know about computers. By then the world will have moved on to something else.</p>
