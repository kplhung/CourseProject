      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>LAST week, I was looking through a camera lens at a glass-topped coffee table for sale in a Houston store called Gallery Furniture. The table did not interest me.</p>
        <p>But then, a few seconds later, I saw a couple stop in the aisle near the table. He wore a baseball cap. She had blond hair. I trained the camera on their faces. As they leaned down to examine the price tag, I wondered if they had noticed something about the curvy-legged piece that I had overlooked. I zoomed in to read over their shoulders: ''Red Hot Value.''</p>
        <p>Then they moved on. So did I.</p>
        <p>In the latest twist on how the Internet is shrinking the zone of anonymity, a growing number of retailers, including the toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz and the Canal Jean Company in Manhattan, have installed cameras to beam images from their stores over the Internet. The idea is that shoppers will use the cameras to examine merchandise, not other customers. The result, depending on how you look at it, is either a new level of consumer empowerment or an appalling intrusion on people's privacy.</p>
        <p>The company that created the system, Perceptual Robotics in Evanston, Ill., has considered both sides of the question. ''It is an interesting debate,'' said Paul Cooper, the company's chief executive. ''But ultimately I think the value you create by giving people the ability to know what's going on through their own eyes outweighs the drawbacks.''</p>
        <p>Perceptual Robotics has been installing Webcams since 1996 to beam images from sporting and entertainment events over the Internet. Last year, the company began installing cameras in stores so real-world inventory could be displayed online. More than half a dozen stores have set up Webcams that can be pointed at merchandise, or whatever, by online viewers. The cameras take snapshots, then send those photos to the viewers who asked to see them. (Perceptual Robotics's store-based Webcams can be found on the company's Web site at pri7.perceptualrobotics.com/live /livecameras.jsp.).</p>
        <p>One of Perpetual Robotics' customers is Gallery Furniture, which has 48 cameras throughout its 90,000-square-foot showroom to send live images over the Internet. Gallery Furniture's owner, Jim McIngvale, said the cameras had been a boon.</p>
        <p>''In the furniture business, the normal procedure is for either the husband or wife to come in first and see something they like, but both parties have to have a look before they decide to buy,'' said Mr. McIngvale, who earned the nickname Mattress Mac by wearing a mattress strapped to his back during a television advertisement. ''Yesterday we had a man in here who was buying a home office desk. So we had the husband call his wife at work and tell her to go take a look at our Internet site. She saw her husband sitting at the desk. They bought it.''</p>
        <p>But like many shoppers, I suspect, I was more intrigued by other shoppers' preferences to gain insight into what I might want to buy. I am the kind of person who will not order a meal until I have surreptitiously eyed diners at the tables to see which entrees they have chosen. In retail, as in restaurants, another consumer's interest adds value to any purchase I am considering.</p>
        <p>When I described my reaction to Mr. Cooper, he explained that shoppers were supposed to use the Zoom In and See From a New Angle features at www.galleryfurniture.com to examine the tufting on the upholstery of the leather sofas, not to see if the blonde who was considering the coffee table had dark roots.</p>
        <p>''It's funny you brought that up, though,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''We are getting a lot of interest from retailers who want to use this as a tool to help understand how buyers buy. We track the traffic on these cameras and know where people are looking.''</p>
        <p>That assuaged my guilt. So did the knowledge that my instinct to snoop was not unusual. ''Your reaction is a very common one,'' said Paco Underhill, managing director of the consulting firm Envirosell and author of ''Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999). ''Whether we're watching 'Survivor' on TV or catching a live glimpse of people shopping, there's a certain voyeuristic attraction.''</p>
        <p>By watching shoppers' behavior over the years (very often with hidden cameras), Mr. Underhill has discovered many interesting things: that men are more likely than women to buy jeans after they try them on, that a woman will spend less time shopping if she is with a man than she would if she were alone or with a child and that products aimed at older shoppers should not be placed on hard-to-reach lower shelves. He has even figured out that shoppers tend to avoid narrow aisles where they might be bumped from behind.</p>
        <p>I had hoped to gather similarly interesting data in the course of several visits to www.galleryfurniture .com. To watch the action unfold, I clicked repeatedly so the images would refresh on the screen as fast as possible. Using a cable modem, it took about 10 seconds to get each new image. ''Right now, a signal is traveling to Houston,'' the site informed me. ''Now a video camera is moving, and now the picture is coming to you.''</p>
        <p>The camera is capable of handling simultaneous requests from as many as 100 Internet viewers. While the viewers are actually taking turns as they ask the camera to turn this way or zoom in on that, they do not realize it because the camera movements are very quick and Internet surfers are accustomed to short delays in interacting with a Web site.</p>
        <p>Here are my notes, which I scrawled in Harriet-the-Spy fashion in a notebook on my desk: (1) the blonde definitely dyes her hair; (2) the salesclerks like to sit behind a potted palm by the plate glass windows and chat; (3) the older the shopper, the more likely he or she is to sit down for a rest in a recliner before heading out to the parking lot.</p>
        <p>None of the other surveillance sites I visited were as useful for spying on people, perhaps because only Gallery Furniture had a Store Map feature that showed me exactly where each camera was mounted. At F.A.O. Schwarz, the cameras seemed gimmicky; I found it difficult to identify the murky items I was viewing in the dark ''Star Wars'' boutique. (To find the Webcam, use the pull-down menu at www.fao.com, choose Shop by Brand, then click on Star Wars New. The Canal Jeans Webcam is new and has not been added to that store's Web site, www.canaljean .com.</p>
        <p>When I described my experiences to Mr. Underhill, he seemed troubled. ''The concept of having live cameras that are accessible to everyone may end up being an invasion of privacy issue,'' he said. ''Someone could conceptually go online and zoom in and see somebody necking in the store. If that picture is taken and placed somewhere, it opens up a whole can of worms.''</p>
        <p>That made me wonder. What if I had witnessed a crime, just as Jimmy Stewart did in ''Rear Window?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Underhill said that every once in a while his research team reviewed a videotape and caught somebody shoplifting. But that is rare. More often, he said, ''it's very poignant, watching very intimate moments in the aisle, like someone getting a hug or scratching their nose.''</p>
        <p>It is legal to monitor customers with a surveillance camera. ''It would be illegal if they captured the audio portion of the signal -- if you could hear what people were saying -- because that would be eavesdropping,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group in San Diego.</p>
        <p>The courts have generally ruled that it is legal to videotape people in places where they should not expect privacy. For example, you could train a video camera on your neighbor's front lawn, but not on your neighbor's bedroom window.</p>
        <p>''But I appreciate it when people tell me I am being videotaped,'' Ms. Givens said. ''Ethically, these stores should be notifying their customers. Otherwise, it feels like the eye of Big Brother following these people invisibly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper said his company required its clients to post signs informing their customers of the cameras. Besides, he added, ''if you're in a 100,000-square-foot showroom with 100 other people, none of whom you know, there's not much expectation of privacy.''</p>
        <p>The stores themselves are less interested in privacy than in commerce. The question for them is whether Webcams increase sales?</p>
        <p>Mr. Underhill said the merchandise might be upstaged by the people in Webcam shots. ''If you look at architectural magazines, they almost never have people in them,'' Mr. Underhill said. ''When people and merchandise compete for attention, the people always win.''</p>
        <p>The retailers disagree. Walt Dunnigan, an information technology manager with Gallery Furniture, said that many customers did their shopping on the Web site before going to the store. ''They walk in holding a picture of what they would like to purchase, walk right over to the item and do the seat test,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Danier, a Canadian leather-goods retailer, installed Webcams in its factory store in December. ''It's really all about marketing and providing customer service,'' said Jeffrey Wortsman, Danier's president. ''If you send an e-mail, the customer service department can demonstrate a product, even come out on the floor to model it for you. We hope to install cameras in all our stores.''</p>
        <p>At Danier.com, I found another use for the storecam. After I snapped a photo of a pair of red leather gloves and sent it via e-mail to a customer service representative to ask the price, I got a response in less than an hour: ''The red gloves are $35 U.S. and the Style No. 3135 0113 and they come in sizes small, medium, large. Best Regards, Paula.''</p>
        <p>I didn't buy the gloves. But I wondered who Paula was.</p>
