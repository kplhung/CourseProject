        <p>The personal digital assistant market got a little confusing last week as Sony unveiled an ultraslim, lithium-ion powered P.D.A. that uses the operating system licensed from Palm Inc.

        <p>The personal digital assistant market got a little confusing last week as Sony unveiled an ultraslim, lithium-ion powered P.D.A. that uses the operating system licensed from Palm Inc. Sony executives say the device pushes Palm capabilities to a higher level of ease of use and flexibility.</p>
        <p>''I would like to emphasize that Sony understands that useability is the most important factor in the P.D.A.,'' said Keiji Kimura, president of the information technology company for the Sony Corporation. ''We place it at the top of the priorities when designing our product.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kimura said the new device, which had not been named, was a work in progress. It mimics many of the most popular features found in Palms, including electronic address books, calendars and simple synchronization with a personal computer. Although the device does not include an onboard wireless Internet connection, like the Palm VII, the Sony palm-size computer features a slot for its Memory Sticks, portable flash memory modules about the size of a stick of chewing gum.</p>
        <p>Memory Sticks, said Takashi Sugiyama, general manager of Sony's network Service Business Center, will not only add memory to the device (just how much is yet to be announced), but  can also add applications.</p>
        <p>Sony's new handheld devices are expected to be introduced in Japan this month and to be available in the United States by late summer or early fall, Mr. Kimura said.</p>
        <p>Sony would not say how much the device would cost, but Mr. Sugiyama said it would be competitive with similar devices.</p>
        <p>The devices, he said, will include color and black-and-white models, each with a push-button dial called a JogDial that will allow users to get access to information with one hand.</p>
