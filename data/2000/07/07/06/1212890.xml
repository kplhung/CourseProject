        <p>Oh, for the simple life of a sailor -- being battered by storms, struggling with broken equipment, subsisting largely on dried bread.</p>
        <p>After three hectic days in New York, the  crew of the Ukrainian schooner Bat'kivshchyna, the little ship that almost didn't make it to OpSail 2000, seemed to have grown a little weary of semi-celebrity.</p>
        <p>''I like New York,'' Vadim Biriukovich, at 14 the youngest member of the crew, said yesterday as an endless line of tourists waited to clamber aboard and hand him $15 for a Bat'kivshchyna T-shirt. ''But sometimes when you get sick of the people, it's pressure on you and you want to be somewhere alone. Also, I am getting homesick. But I'm not complaining.''</p>
        <p>His grandfather and the captain of the ship, Dmytro Biriukovich, was doing his best not to complain, too.</p>
        <p>''New York is great, better than small town,'' the captain said as he was hustled off the boat, docked at West 44th Street just below the carrier Intrepid, to attend a reception at the Ukrainian consulate, ''but I'm tired here.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, New York has been very, very good business for the grossly underfinanced Bat'kivshchyna (pronounced bat-keev-SHIN-a), which endured a three-month, 8,000-mile voyage involving pretty much every hardship between stem and stern to take part in Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail.</p>
        <p>''We need these T-shirts!'' Roy Kellogg, the captain's son-in-law, barked into a borrowed cell phone. ''We need them now! He's sending us partial shipments.''</p>
        <p>Minutes later, Mr. Kellogg, a Canadian-born public relations consultant who has been coordinating the voyage from on land, emerged with big news.</p>
        <p>''We finally found a sponsor,'' he announced, and introduced Andrei Hartt, the United States importer of Soomska Ukrainian vodka, winner of two of the four top spots in the most recent Beverage Trade Institute competition in the flavored vodka category.</p>
        <p>The sponsorship deal involves an undisclosed amount of cash and a large amount of merchandise, Mr. Kellogg said.</p>
        <p>''He's provided three cases right now for New York,'' Mr. Kellogg said, ''and will supply a party of 500 people with vodka -- that's about 250 bottles -- in Connecticut, and provide vodka in Halifax and Portland.''</p>
        <p>''It's not a huge sponsorship,'' Mr. Kellogg added, ''but the crew will love the vodka. That's why we're selling T-shirts: to get the crew vodka.''</p>
        <p>The little sightseeing that crew members have had time for has been mostly a blur.</p>
        <p>''The buildings here fantastic,'' said Gena Vovk, the souvenir concessionaire. ''Times Square is unbelievable. And I saw a nice dog made of flowers, in Rockefeller Center.''</p>
        <p>In the four days' shore leave he has left, Vadim Biriukovich said, he hoped to visit the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.</p>
        <p>''I like to find the Sex Pistols' album for what they won the award on MTV,'' he said. ''And maybe Offspring -- from their six albums I heard only four.''</p>
        <p>The pomp of the Fourth of July seemed to have made little impression on him. ''I don't want to lie to you,'' he said when asked about Tuesday night's fireworks. ''I expected some kind of picture -- something like '2000' or maybe American flag.''</p>
        <p>But Katya Dvornichenko, a crew member and 21-year-old philology student, was more than contented.</p>
        <p>''It was my dream to see fireworks above the Statue of Liberty,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I saw that. Now since that time I have no more dreams. I do not know what to dream now.''</p>
