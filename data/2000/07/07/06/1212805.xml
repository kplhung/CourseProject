        <p>Black Entertainment Television, the nation's only 24-hour cable network meant for African-Americans, has selected an East Harlem office building for the location of a New York office and studio, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company's long-awaited New York office will be a production operation and headquarters for its music division, which is one of three divisions that provide original programming for the network. It will be in a former office building on East 106th Street, near Park Avenue, and is scheduled to open in September, in time for the beginning of the fall television season.</p>

        <p>Black Entertainment Television, the nation's only 24-hour cable network meant for African-Americans, has selected an East Harlem office building for the location of a New York office and studio, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company's long-awaited New York office will be a production operation and headquarters for its music division, which is one of three divisions that provide original programming for the network. It will be in a former office building on East 106th Street, near Park Avenue, and is scheduled to open in September, in time for the beginning of the fall television season.</p>
        <p>Officials did not disclose the cost of construction of the facilities or the price of the lease.</p>
        <p>Black Entertainment Television, a subsidiary of Washington-based BET Holdings II, is the latest in a long list of large corporations to make substantial investments in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Last week, Magic Johnson Theaters, Harlem's first multiplex, opened in the six-level $66 million Harlem U.S.A. shopping and entertainment complex at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.</p>
        <p>The complex is the home to stores for several national chains, including HMV records, Disney, Old Navy and  Modell's Sporting Goods.</p>
        <p>Other developments in the area include a new retail complex planned  between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Malcolm X Boulevard and a new 50,000-square-foot shopping market planned for 145th Street.</p>
        <p>''By transferring much of our music-oriented programming to New York City, we put BET right in the center of the music universe,'' Curtis Gadson, the network's vice president for programming, said in a statement. ''This will give us greater access to the top talent for both appearances and performances on our shows.''</p>
        <p>A 10,000-square-foot office space and 7,000-square-foot studio are expected to be completed by the end of the summer, officials said. There will be 10 to 15 full-time workers housed in the complex, and dozens of other contract employees, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Unlike the ABC and MTV studios with windows that overlook Times Square and allow for participation from audience members on the street, BET's studio will be entirely enclosed, officials said.</p>
        <p>''It is different from what our counterparts have done in Times Square,'' said Michael Lewellen, a spokesman for BET.</p>
        <p>''It does not have windows that look out on a New York vantage point, but the flavor of the shows will be New York.''</p>
        <p>Company officials said that several of the shows, including new music programs for the fall season called ''106th and Park'' and ''BET in NY,'' will take on a New York setting, with video disc jockeys getting outdoors and using the city as a backdrop.</p>
        <p>In addition to bringing new jobs, Mr. Lewellen said that the company also hopes to provide work to television and music contractors now in Harlem.</p>
        <p>The move to New York is a part of a three-pronged strategy in which the company will put its music division in New York, its entertainment division in Los Angeles and its news programming in Washington.</p>
        <p>In June, BET announced plans to cut approximately 50 positions in its network operations, programming and production departments. The cuts were attributed to technological upgrades and the network's decision to open the New York office.</p>
