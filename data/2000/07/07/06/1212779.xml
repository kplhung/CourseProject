        <p>ALL the feng shui in the cosmos -- and Elie Tahari couldn't have furnished his Manhattan penthouses, two for business, one for personal shelter, without it -- won't help him mellow out.</p>
        <p>Not even pretty clothes (he designs them) or pretty girls (he just married one) can calm him as he and Chase Manhattan Bank, their tenant-and-landlord honeymoon unraveling in court, have declared war, ostensibly over sprinklers the bank maintains that he, the tenant, refused to install at 510 Fifth Avenue, off 43rd Street. Chase's legal team, experienced hardball players, even likened Mr. Tahari's airy, carpeted sample room there to -- horrors -- a sweatshop.</p>
        <p>Try ferreting out the feng shui in that scenario: even a self-help guru couldn't do it. (Mr. Tahari's favorite is Eric Butterworth, whom he credits with rescuing him from the Sodom and Gomorrah excesses of the New York fashion experience.)</p>
        <p>But litigation doesn't stand on sob stories or decorating schemes: litigation shuts down your $150 million-a-year clothing empire. Mr. Tahari has been ballistic ever since.</p>
        <p>That's why Mr. Tahari, with his firefly body language (just try making him sit still) and firebrand's temper (he recently tossed a punch at his landlord's lawyer) is pacing the only penthouse office where he's still welcome, this showplace atop the Grace Building, a block from the supposed sweatshop. Mr. Tahari, who recalls his orphanage upbringing in Israel as an improvement over life with his splintered family in a one-room Jerusalem ghetto, spoils himself when it comes to his surroundings.</p>
        <p>But today he is ignoring the soothing mounds of Granny Smith apples in their wooden bowls, ignoring the acrophobia-inducing 48th-floor vistas, even ignoring his cell phone. He is so hot under the collar of the gray shirt that matches the stubble on his chin -- who has time to shave when disaster descends? -- that he summons an assistant to haul in plastic floor fans (goodbye feng shui) and unfurl the blinds (goodbye view).</p>
        <p>''They're trying to shut down my business! It's a ghost town in my design room!'' stews the elfin Mr. Tahari, who has continued to pay the salaries of 80 displaced sample-makers since the courts shut him down on June 14. ''This isn't just about the little guy against the big guy; this is about good against evil.'' Hint: that's Mr. Tahari in the white hat.</p>
        <p>Besides commencing eviction proceedings, Chase got a restraining order that bars Mr. Tahari and his workers from the premises. Which is why he describes Chase as ''the $63 billion bully,'' its squadron of real estate lawyers as ''lease terminators'' and vows to fight to the finish. Ditto, says Chase.</p>
        <p>''They picked on the wrong guy,'' counters Mr. Tahari, who maintains that Chase trumped up the sweatshop charges in a ploy to restructure his below-market-value lease privileges at 510 Fifth, a building Chase wants to sell. But not to Mr. Tahari, who tried to buy it in April to turn it into a Tahari flagship. The consensus is that the glass landmark is worth $5 million more to Chase, and even more to its next owner, if Mr. Tahari, whose lease runs to 2011, is removed.</p>
        <p>Over his dead body.</p>
        <p>THE fracas is sapping the resources of the spiritualist within the 48-year-old Mr. Tahari. Not to mention its impact on his creativity and his wallet, which lately, on his physician's advice, contains a packet of tranquilizers to keep him from getting too manic as his profit margin shrivels.</p>
        <p>Tube tops, a disco-era staple, made him his first Manhattan million; then came business suits that were simultaneously demure and curvaceous and earned his ''king of the jacket'' sobriquet. Now it is time for him to bestow the finishing touches on his chic lineup for spring 2001, but instead of sprinkling sequins on samples for Bloomie's and Bergdorf's, he's shuffling court documents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tahari's route to fashion success could well be the most picaresque on the planet. Back at the orphanage, he used his delivery-boy tips for a pair of glittery, hip-hugger bell-bottom pants, not for a girlfriend, but for himself: he figured they'd make him a babe magnet.</p>
        <p>''I was ahead of my time,'' he says. But he didn't get the babe. After a two-year stint in the Israeli Air Force -- he wanted to be a pilot but wound up fixing engines -- he found himself unwelcome at home and, with a standby ticket, followed an old girlfriend to Manchester, England, only to discover that she had married somebody else. Then came another standby ticket, this time to New York, where he showed up with $60 in his pocket and slept on Central Park benches before settling at a shelter at St. Marks Place.</p>
        <p>He worked days as an electrician in the garment district; nights, he sold clothes in Greenwich Village. With bralessness at its zenith, he transformed some fabric tubes from Orchard Street into scanty tops. They cost him $1 and retailed for $4, and everybody bought them. Then ''the tube man'' began designing disco dresses (an avid roller skater, he still convenes with the old Roxy crowd). In 1974, he opened his own business on Seventh Avenue.</p>
        <p>By the end of the decade, he was a multimillionaire and a mess: ''My life was one big party,'' he says of a reclamation project that began in the 80's. This year, finally, he thought he had life, and business, in feng shui order: a supportive wife, a product that holds up against the Guccis and Pradas. Everybody who was anybody took his calls. All except his old friends at Chase.</p>
