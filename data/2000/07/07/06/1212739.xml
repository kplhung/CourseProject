        <p>THE future of electronic surveillance, family style, can be found at Hyland Hills Water World, a theme park north of downtown Denver.</p>
        <p>On a typical summer day, thousands of children cavort among 65 acres of water slides, wave pools and rafting rides, and their parents try to keep up with them. Now two companies have introduced an electronic locating system, ParkWatch, that helps parents do just that.</p>
        <p>Visitors can wear watch-size ParkWatch devices that transmit signals to antennas throughout the park. Family members can go to special kiosks in the park to have the whereabouts of others in their group displayed on a video map.</p>
        <p>''It allows all of us a little bit more freedom and flexibility,'' said Chery Wick of Denver, who, like many parents, had never been comfortable allowing her children to roam freely in a theme park. But at Water World recently, she rested by a pool, knowing that while her daughters, ages 9 and 12, were nowhere to be seen, she could find them because they were wearing the devices.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't be on their own right now without it,'' Ms. Wick said.</p>
        <p>For now, the system, developed by ParkWatch of Clarksburg, Md., and WhereNet of Santa Clara, Calif., is being used only at Hyland Hills Water World. But the companies hope that the equipment, adapted from technology used to track parts in warehouses and factories, will catch on at other parks.</p>
        <p>It is a precursor of systems that could track a person just about anywhere. Applied Digital Solutions of Palm Beach, Fla., plans to demonstrate a prototype later this year of its Digital Angel, a small tracking device that can be implanted under the skin or attached to a wristwatch. The wearer's location is determined using the Global Positioning System. And at least two other companies plans to adapt technology for use in tracking humans, with prototypes available in about a year.</p>
        <p>Not everyone believes that the tracking devices are a good idea.</p>
        <p>''There are a myriad of ethical and security issues,'' said Andrew Shen, a policy analyst for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I'd worry about the people with malicious intent,'' Mr. Shen said, ''and opening  yourself up to abuses from people working  at those companies where the tracking takes place.''</p>
        <p>Even a locator system in an amusement park, he added, ''shouldn't be a substitute for keeping a watchful eye on a kid.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, you may be able to find your son or daughter,'' he added, ''but that doesn't mean your kid is going to stay out of trouble. Kids can get hurt or upset if they are lost, and wearing a tracking device on their wrist doesn't help that much.''</p>
        <p>The developers of ParkWatch note that the use of the system is voluntary so security concerns are not a problem. People can choose to rent the devices, which cost $2 or $3 a day, depending upon the size of the group.</p>
        <p>''Any time you have a large crowd, there is a possibility of separation,'' said Joanne Dobbs, communications manager for the park. ''This can give parents peace of mind.''</p>
        <p>The high-tech aspect of the system has a certain appeal.</p>
        <p>''I think it's pretty cool,'' said Gabrielle Villanueva, 8, as she raced toward a rafting ride at Water World. ''It's keeping us safe even if we are separated.''</p>
        <p>ParkWatch officials said setting up the system at Water World was a good test of its capacity because of the park's because of its hilly terrain and its numerous slides and other rides.</p>
        <p>''This location was relatively challenging,'' said Andrew O'Neill, general manager of ParkWatch. ''We had to establish a system that would resolve problems and build a transmitter that could be used everywhere.''</p>
        <p>The park has 14 antennas, many of them hidden, around the perimeter and six kiosks  for calling up maps. Each tracking device  weighs only a few ounces and is attached to the wrist, ankle or bathing suit with a fiber band that can be removed only by cutting it.</p>
        <p>Each device has a serial number, and users can assign names or other labels.</p>
        <p>To locate someone, anyone in the group can go to one of the electronic maps and scan a bar code on the wrist device. Within seconds, icons corresponding to the other members will appear on the screen, with their names or other labels. For example, Johnny might be at the Thunder Bay water slide while Susie is across the park, tubing on the Lazy River ride.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the device sends out a signal, with a unique code for each device, every eight seconds. The signal is picked up by the antennas, and then a computer uses triangulation (based on the slight time differences of the signal reaching the various antennas) to determine location within about 10 feet. The devices do not work underwater.</p>
        <p>Dan Doles, president of WhereNet, compared ParkWatch with cell phones. ''There are towers or antennas where you are within a coverage area,'' Mr. Doles said. ''Except a cell phone has about 1 watt, and ParkWatch has only 2 to 3 milliwatts.''</p>
        <p>''I liken it to upside-down G.P.S.,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''In a G.P.S. environment, you know where it is from the satellite. Here it sends out a signal after it identifies itself.''</p>
        <p>Applied Digital Solutions' product, Digital Angel, which is in development, actually uses G.P.S. data to get location information, which is then transmitted to a receiver or cell phone network.</p>
        <p>''In concept, a mother could pull up a screen on a cell phone and enter the code for her 'angel' and then be able to get the location of the device, literally within several feet,'' said Richard Sullivan, chief executive of Applied Digital Solutions. Mr. Sullivan said the device would be powered by a small battery that would be recharged by body motion.</p>
        <p>Like WhereNet, the transmitter already has a more mundane use, in the food industry. ''It tracks everything from beef to poultry, from the time it leaves the grazing field to the supermarket shelves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Digital Angel was first developed by a former police officer who had become frustrated by missing-children cases, Mr. Sullivan said.</p>
        <p>''His hope was that at least someone might be able to recover the child,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan estimated that Digital Angel might cost about $50 when it entered the commercial market and might also be used to monitor things like heart problems.</p>
        <p>''If Digital Angel can improve the safety and well-being of families and children, improve people's quality of life, then it's met the goal,'' Mr. Sullivan said, adding that other potential uses could be to track soldiers during wartime, missing hikers and people with Alzheimer's. The devices could even be used inside luggage.</p>
        <p>Rankin Technologies of Canada currently markets a wireless tracking device called Boomerang for use in motor vehicles and marine and construction equipment. The devices track locations using an analog cellular network system, and users find their property by getting real-time location data from a secure Internet site.</p>
        <p>The company (www.vehicletracking .com) plans to 'miniaturize Boomerang by August 2001 for use in tracking children, pets and small valuables.</p>
        <p>SnapTrack, a subsidiary of Qualcomm in California, currently has a Palm-like device available in Japan that can transmit the user's location, based on G.P.S. data.</p>
        <p>SnapTrack's device is marketed to business people and is generally used like other G.P.S. devices, using the user's location in conjunction with maps for navigation within a city. But it could also transmit the user's location to another person.</p>
        <p>''If two people have them, they have to subscribe, have to be willing to be found,'' said John Cunningham, marketing director for SnapTrack. And at $500 each, however, the devices are probably prohibitively expensive for family tracking.</p>
        <p>But SnapTrack is working with Loc8.net and Glenayre Technologies on a two-way pager that will give authorized friends and family access to location data through map displays on the Internet or through a 911 call center.</p>
        <p>Parents at Water World who have used ParkWatch said it was an idea whose time had come. ''As a parent, everbody's concerned with kids getting abducted in this day and age,'' said Dan Villanueva, 33, who had his 8- and 4-year-old daughters with him. ''This is one way to help us out when we go to events.''</p>
