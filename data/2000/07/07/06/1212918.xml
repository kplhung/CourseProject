        <p>HEJDUK-John. On July 3, 2000. Former dean of the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. The college mourns the loss of this distinguished architect, teacher, humanist and friend, who until his recent retirement had been professionally associated with the school for a half-century. A Cooper Union graduate, John Hejduk devoted his life to advancing the theory and practice of the architectural art through education and personal influence, offering his talents in a variety of forms. Through his drawings, his theoretical work, his poetry and particularly his example, John Hejduk demonstrated to those around him the profound significance of the relationship between humanity and the structures it builds for its own home. His work will continue to guide generations of students and professionals, and his spirit and accomplishment will continue to grace the halls of the school to which he made such a significant and unparalleled contribution. The entire Cooper Union community offers its deepest condolences to the Hejduk family. Dr. George Campbell Jr., President John Jay Iselin, President Emeritus Robert A. Bernhard, Chairman, Board of Trustees The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art</p>
