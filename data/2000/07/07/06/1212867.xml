        <p>The Aer Lingus Group P.L.C. appointed Michael Foley, president of Heineken USA Inc., as chief executive. He succeeds Garry Cullen, who resigned in February, saying he did not want to lead the state-owned airline through a planned public stock offering. Mr. Foley, 52, previously ran Murphy's Brewery, a Heineken subsidiary in Cork, and lived in Ireland until 1994. The Irish government hopes to privatize Aer Lingus through an initial public offering later this year.</p>
