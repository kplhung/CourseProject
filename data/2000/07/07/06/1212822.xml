        <p>Across the net from the hulking Mark Philippoussis, the knee-high Andre Agassi stood at the crash site for a barrage of serves that seemed to be ticking as they landed in the grass before him.</p>
        <p>Somehow, Agassi emerged unscathed today. With flashbulb-quick reflexes, Agassi deflected the incoming danger with his sleight-of-hand returns and nimble footwork, using his trademark qualities to usher him through his quarterfinal match, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-4. But just after match point, as Agassi bowed and blew kisses to each side of Center Court, there was an emanating sense of disbelief.</p>
        <p>The end came so quickly. Although the Wimbledon crowds have come to crave the style of the slick-headed American, most thought the 10th-seeded Philippoussis, equipped with a 130-mile-an-hour serve, would pose much more of a challenge for Agassi.</p>
        <p>It was Pete Sampras who had the easy draw, not Agassi. But faced with the unseeded Jan-Michael Gambill -- the 23-year-old American with a shiny two-handed forehand and six polished Jaguars in his garage -- Sampras was briefly rattled by his opponents' ability to counter his slick serves and crafty drop shots with whip-snap passes.</p>
        <p>It was only a temporary scare, though. Sampras regained control of his match, used 26 aces to dismiss Gambill, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4, and kept the American dream for a Sampras-Agassi final alive. To reach that point, Agassi will have to find an escape hatch against the 12th-seeded Patrick Rafter in the semifinals. And with nothing but recent film to go on, Sampas will have to prepare for an unseeded 22-year-old known only in some parts of Belarus and in a tiny pocket of Brooklyn. As a teenager, Vladamir Voltchkov spent three years training at the Brooklyn Racket Club on Shell Road and Avenue Z before going back to Europe.</p>
        <p>Voltchkov defeated Byron Black by 7-6  (2), 7-6 (2), 6-4 today to become the first male qualifier to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon since John McEnroe did it in 1977. Voltchkov never expected to last this long. When he walked into the interview room today, he was wearing shorts he borrowed from Marat Safin. ''I came here without any clothes,'' said Voltchkov, who does not have a clothing contract, a shoe deal or much money in his pocket. ''I'm sure after winning a qualifier, you can afford to go to a restaurant, if you want. My dad is a really good cook, so we stay at home. We usually just go out for a walk, but I went to see 'Gladiator' four times already. I prefer to spend my money there.''</p>
        <p>Win or lose in the semifinals, Voltchkov is guaranteed at least $193,000 in prize money. When asked if he would supply his wardrobe-thin next opponent with some footwear, Sampras was generous with his sarcasm. ''I'll give him some hard-court shoes,'' Sampras said with a smile. ''I won't give him any grass-court shoes.''</p>
        <p>Moving unhampered on his tender shin, Sampras ran through a pair or two of his Nikes today. Gambill had him chasing his shots several times but could not deliver the pivotal points on cue, as Sampras did. To put himself in position to serve for the match, Sampras ripped a forehand passing shot for a winner to crush the resolve of an aching Gambill. Often stopping to rub his various pains, Gambill endured an aching hip and an odd abrasion on his chest.</p>
        <p>''I was bleeding from the shirt rubbing against my chest,'' said Gambill, who countered Sampras's big serve with 23 aces of his own. ''It was weird. It's not something you want to happen to you on Center Court.''</p>
        <p>One day, Gambill may get another chance on Center Court. By advancing to the semifinals, he rekindled the faith many once had in him as the next great American player.</p>
        <p>''He went through a little sophomore jinx,'' Sampras said. ''He's got a big serve. Whenever you look at a young guy coming up, you look at a weapon. He's got it.''</p>
        <p>But no one on tour can rival Philippoussis. In his previous two matches, Philippoussis had launched a total of 77 aces. But Agassi is a master of the return. As the match drew out, Agassi started to lock in on Philippoussis' serve. Agassi went from returning 29 percent of his serves in the opening set to 46 percent by the third. Although Philippoussis pounded 22 aces, he also served up six untimely double faults, including one on a break point in the eighth game of the second set.</p>
        <p>''I don't get distracted by people acing me,'' Agassi said. ''I try to just make sure I do well with the opportunities I get. That's assuming I'm taking care of my own serve.''</p>
        <p>He paid attention to the details of his serve, and mixed up the looks he gave Philippoussis when he planned his return.</p>
        <p>The ever-evolving Agassi is a genius of disguise. He came into this tournament under a cloak of uncertainty. For three months, Agassi had been on a minor slide that seemed in danger of growing worse after he tweaked his back at Queen's Club the week before Wimbledon. But after scrambling past an unnerved Todd Martin in a five-set comeback to get by the second round, he has played crisp and clean. Rafter knows what he's up against. He lost to Agassi in the semifinals here last year.</p>
        <p>''Andre is playing well, but hopefully the outcome can be a little different for me,'' said Rafter who advanced to the semifinals after beating Alexander Popp, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (1). ''I've played Andre a few times when he's had really bad days. I just hope he has one again. It's very hard to get him under a bad day, though.''</p>
