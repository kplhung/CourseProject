        <p>After the tall ships and before the fireworks, during today's Music and Heritage Festival at Liberty State Park here, came Louis Armstrong. As everyone knows -- or as everyone will be reminded over the next 18 months -- Armstrong's real birthday has been determined to be Aug. 4, 1901. But he always believed his birthday was July 4, 1900, and given his historic stature as a piece of America who belongs to all that live here, it makes more sense to orient ourselves around the same date he did.</p>
        <p>So the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, which will be part of the dozen Armstrong events in the forthcoming Jazz at Lincoln Center season in New York (and many more concerts around the world when the band tours), chose Independence Day to begin the Armstrong centennial. The orchestra headlined an all-day bill here that included the Gully Low Jazz Band, a sextet whose instrumentation (tuba, trombone, clarinet, trumpet, banjo and drums) echoed Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven bands, and a group led by the former Armstrong bassist Arvell Shaw.</p>

        <p>After the tall ships and before the fireworks, during today's Music and Heritage Festival at Liberty State Park here, came Louis Armstrong. As everyone knows -- or as everyone will be reminded over the next 18 months -- Armstrong's real birthday has been determined to be Aug. 4, 1901. But he always believed his birthday was July 4, 1900, and given his historic stature as a piece of America who belongs to all that live here, it makes more sense to orient ourselves around the same date he did.</p>
        <p>So the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, which will be part of the dozen Armstrong events in the forthcoming Jazz at Lincoln Center season in New York (and many more concerts around the world when the band tours), chose Independence Day to begin the Armstrong centennial. The orchestra headlined an all-day bill here that included the Gully Low Jazz Band, a sextet whose instrumentation (tuba, trombone, clarinet, trumpet, banjo and drums) echoed Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven bands, and a group led by the former Armstrong bassist Arvell Shaw.</p>
        <p>Jazz at Lincoln Center's crowd-pleasing second set, with the singer Dianne Reeves, featured a few numbers, reprised material played during the band's recent For Dancers Only tour: swing songs with dance rhythms. But its first set, broadcast live on National Public Radio, was the long, hot day's musical bedrock.</p>
        <p>It was made up of big-band arrangements of songs (by Don Redman and others) associated with Armstrong during the 1920's and 30's. They were superbly played: clean, hard swinging, peeling off the patina of big-band nostalgia with its pulsating rhythm section and narrowing down into parts in which small sections of the band took over.</p>
        <p>When you step into Armstrong's voice,  you're either committing the grossest mimicry or you're freeing something within yourself.</p>
        <p>The trombonist Wycliffe Gordon sang some of the Armstrong vocals (including ''Lazy River''), and he has found a good, non-cute solution for how to deal with the problem. He kept much of the famous phrasing -- inevitably, as his own trombone playing is deeply influenced by Armstrong -- but wasn't after an imitation of the growl. You heard a shadow version that was ultimately more Gordon than Armstrong.</p>
        <p>Ultimately the trumpeter Clark Terry stole the show with a few extraordinary flugelhorn solos. The Lincoln Center band is a collection of zealous players; you can count on musicians like Wynton Marsalis, Ryan Kisor, Mr.  Gordon and Wessell Anderson to deliver speed, force and stamina. (Mr. Kisor, playing ''Tiger Rag,'' hurtled through an impressive light-speed improvisation, quoting Clifford Brown's ''Parisian Thoroughfare'' along the way, that made the brain hurt.) But the 79-year-old Mr. Terry, a veteran of the Basie and Ellington bands, used gentleness.</p>
        <p>Sitting with his legs crossed, Mr. Terry contributed solos to ''When It's Sleepy Time Down South'' and ''Struttin' With Some Barbecue.'' Playing long notes, he made his rhythms bob and weave with serene independence. He sounded far better than in club dates and at a recent Armstrong tribute at Carnegie Hall.  His playing sounded bright, melodic and unresearched; it glided, moving with feeling.</p>
        <p>The best tribute one can give in Armstrong's voice is to find one's own voice within something that was his, and Mr. Terry made over ''Struttin' With Some Barbecue'' into his sound, using some of Armstrong's ideas but playing them creamy and soft, rather than attempting the stirring, nail-gun phrasing that Armstrong favored for it.</p>
