        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While it is true that people in wheelchairs must have access to transportation, the solution proposed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission to replace taxicabs with sport utility vehicles (news article, June 29) is wrong from the point of view of traffic congestion, pollution and cost.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the existing taxis need not be taken off the streets: they are difficult to get in and out of, and offer cramped space at best.</p>
        <p>The appropriate solution would be to set up a call-up service that would provide wheelchair-accessible transportation on request. Each participant would be provided a cellular telephone automatically linked to the dispatch service, which should be set up to provide a vehicle within 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>While this may be a somewhat longer wait than ordinary taxi service, it would be a vast improvement over the current situation and would keep S.U.V.'s off the streets.</p>
