        <p>The situation was obvious to Bobby M. Jones, and no one had to explain it to him. ''I've got common sense,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jones watched tonight's game unfold, and the more runs the Mets piled on, the less chance he had of starting on Sunday. Mike Hampton was doing his part to make sure he -- and not Jones -- starts against the Yankees in the final game before the All-Star Game break.</p>
        <p>''I knew when we opened the lead up pretty good, it looked like we had a good chance to get Mike out of there, and he'll start Sunday,'' Jones said. ''That's obvious. That's a given. That's what you want.''</p>
        <p>Hampton threw only 79 pitches over six strong innings, and he matched a personal mark and club record for hits by a pitcher with three to help the Mets beat the Marlins, 11-2. Outfielder Derek Bell, acquired in the same trade with Houston last winter, also had three hits as the Mets avoided a sweep.</p>
        <p>If Hampton starts Sunday -- getting a rematch with David Cone of the rained-out game they started last month -- he will do so on three days' rest. Manager Bobby Valentine said Hampton will probably make the start if he meets two conditions: his stiff lower back improves, and Valentine finds out that Hampton historically pitches well with short rest. Neither should be an issue.</p>
        <p>Hampton said he has had back stiffness consistently since he was 14 years old, but he said it is ''nothing that lingers'' and was ''almost nonexistent'' tonight. As for starting on three days' rest, Hampton won his only start in that situation last year, and over the last five years, he is 2-0 with a 3.38 earned run average in four starts on three days' rest.</p>
        <p>''I've felt pretty comfortable on three days' rest,'' Hampton said. ''I feel I bounce back pretty quickly; I think I take care of myself. I don't see it being a problem.''</p>
        <p>Whoever pitches against the Yankees, the Mets will have one more weapon than they did when the teams met in June. Bell was in the middle of a dreadful slump in that series, and although he had five runs batted in when the Mets beat the Yankees, 12-2, it was only a one-day vacation from his slide.</p>
        <p>Bell has been wildly streaky, and his hot streaks and slumps have been long. After a slow start, he blistered National League pitching for a .404 average over 36 games. Then he struggled for three weeks.</p>
        <p>Now, Bell is hot again. He is trying deliberately to pull the ball, but by starting his swing earlier, he has also been better at hitting to right. He singled to right in the first inning, then singled to right-center in the third. In the sixth, he got an inside fastball from Joe Strong and crushed it into the seats above the tall left-field scoreboard for a three-run homer.</p>
        <p>He hit a three-run shot to the same location on Tuesday and has four homers in his last 14 games, during which time he is batting .468.</p>
        <p>''When I'm looking to turn on the ball, it's helping me be consistent and not get jammed, and do what it takes to get it out of the ballpark,'' Bell said. ''That's the fun thing about it -- I'm getting through the ball and learning how to get lift on the ball instead of lining it at people.''</p>
        <p>Bell's singles had helped the Mets build a lead, and earned him praise from Valentine, who said Bell is the best hit-and-run batter he has managed since Julio Franco, who won a batting title for Valentine in Texas.  Melvin Mora led off the game with a single off the Marlins' Chuck Smith, and Bell singled through the hole in right, advancing Mora to third. Mike Piazza's single scored Mora, and Robin Ventura brought in Bell with a groundout to put the Mets ahead, 2-0.</p>
        <p>Bell and Piazza also singled in the third, and Todd Zeile drew a two-out walk to load the bases. Jay Payton chopped a ball to the first-base side of the pitcher's mound, and Smith overran it. Payton was safe, Bell scored, and one batter later Benny Agbayani drove in two with a single to put the Mets ahead, 5-1.</p>
        <p>Bell put the game out of reach with his sixth-inning homer, which made the score 8-1. Bell does not like words like streaky -- when his average plummeted, he said, he was still hitting the ball hard. But Hampton has seen stretches like this from Bell before, and he enjoys them. ''When he gets hot, he's a tough out,'' Hampton said. ''He's a tough out, anyway. But when he gets hot, you think, 'How do you ever beat this guy?' The big thing about Derek is as long as he's confident and believes in himself, he's going to be a great player.''</p>
        <p>Hampton believes in himself, and he thrives on games like the one he seems certain to pitch on Sunday night. ''Facing the Yankees is a test in itself,'' he said. ''That's what pitchers look for.''</p>
