        <p>When it comes to making an instant visual impact, there is nothing like a nun.

        <p>When it comes to making an instant visual impact, there is nothing like a nun. Moviemakers have understood this principle for decades, turning images of women in wimples into visions both inexpressibly haunting (Alfred Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'') and flat-out silly (''Sister Act''). Call it the force of the habit, a strong picturesque signal that can be reinforced as a symbol of mystery or disrupted for quick comic effect.</p>
        <p>Terrence O'Brien, the astute artistic director of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, plies that image to startling double-pronged effect in his refreshing outdoor production of ''Measure for Measure,'' which runs through July 30 on the riverside grounds of the Boscobel Restoration here.</p>
        <p>The heroine of Shakespeare's thorny play is a convent novitiate, the rigidly principled Isabella, dressed in austere bridal white. And after a scene of vicious emotional confrontation, Mr. O'Brien achieves a wonderfully troubled lyricism by simply having his Isabella (Aidan Sullivan) turn her back to the audience and step slowly away from the tented playing area, into the summer gloaming of the Hudson River landscape.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Sullivan reappears at the beginning of the evening's second half, her serene expression suggests that she may have benefited from this moment of communion. Then without changing her solemn, prayerful posture, the actress begins to lip synch to a recording of Eartha Kitt purring ''Santa Baby,'' a gold digger's Christmas list of a song. The male cast members, choreographed by Amy O'Brien, dance in shifting rows behind the unmoving Ms. Sullivan, suggesting a Renaissance answer to Las Vegas showgirls.</p>
        <p>So just how serious is Mr. O'Brien being here? Or, if you prefer, how silly? It might help to remember that ''Measure for Measure'' is a tragicomedy, whose seeming contrasts in tone have baffled and galled interpreters for centuries. This production acknowledges the play's tragic dimension, but only at a distance, with moments when the characters seem to step outside the action, as though the wicked world were too much with them.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, as the ''Santa Baby'' number reminds us, this ''Measure'' is first and foremost an entertainment, more likely to seek out the light than the dark. Take it too seriously, and you'll have trouble swallowing it comfortably. Follow Mr. O'Brien's lead, and look upon the show as a blithe fable with darker echoes, and you'll have a most amiable evening.</p>
        <p>Amiable is not a word traditionally associated with Shakespeare's tale of lust, death and sexual hypocrisy in nasty old Vienna. Samuel Coleridge went so far as to call it ''the only painful play'' in the canon. Later critics sought to justify it as a Christian allegory, but many of its more recent champions have reveled in the work's cynicism, with Harold Bloom lauding it as a ''masterpiece of nihilism'' and ''a comedy that destroys comedy.'' Contemporary productions have not, for the most part, been frolics in the park.</p>
        <p>All the same, beneath its sour and shadowy surface, ''Measure'' has a gleaming, well-oiled comic machinery, and it is to this that Mr. O'Brien firmly hitches his version. He paces the show with a bubbly, comforting tempo that points to a sunny ending on the horizon. His portrait of a debauched society is satiric without being censuring, and he lets the characters register a healthy human astonishment at the play's greater improbabilities (including one of those wearisome ''bed tricks'').</p>
        <p>This extroverted approach is not without sacrifices, including psychological complexity. Angelo (played with an unrelenting sneer by Stephen Paul Johnson), the death-dealing, puritanical statesman and one of literature's most fascinating sexual hypocrites, becomes a secondary character, more a stock villain than a case study.</p>
        <p>But Vincentio (Kurt Rhoads), the Duke who takes a sabbatical from his civic duties to disguise himself as a friar, and Isabella, the fledgling nun who becomes the focus of Angelo's unseemly advances, make more sense than they usually do. Mr. Rhoads presents the Duke as neither a Prospero-like dispenser of justice nor a sadistic manipulator, but as a low-key publicity-shy sort who has never quite known how to fill his royal role. His emotional path appealingly turns into a belated coming of age.</p>
        <p>The intense Ms. Sullivan, a recent graduate of Juilliard, makes it immediately clear that Isabella is not to the convent born, as she uncomfortably tugs at her wimple. She seems to have assumed the nun's habit as  armor against a sexually active society; whenever the idea of conjugal activity comes up, she begins fretfully smoothing out her gown. And her willingness to sacrifice the life of her brother Claudio (Christian Casper) to preserve her virginity appears to stem less from righteousness than from youthful, unthinking fear.</p>
        <p>A few of the supporting actors are too stridently one-note, and several scenes that should register as dramatic thunderclaps come across as little more than coughs. But the performers have a comic ease and energy that blend right into the evening's disarmingly relaxed tone. Even better, most of them speak the language with conversational assurance, and scarcely a joke or pun passes by unnoticed.</p>
        <p>Chris Edwards's Brooklyn-accented Pompey the panderer is terrific, a street-smart wise guy who makes no apologies for his pragmatic approach to life. Nance Williamson, who doubles as the winsome Mariana, creates a vivid, Hogarth-ish portrait of Mistress Overdone, the brothel keeper, as a tic-ridden, one-eyed catalog of syphilitic afflictions. Donald Warfield and James Coyle provide balancing, warmly naturalistic interpretations as men of state.</p>
        <p>From its opening, a lively presentation of the entire ensemble in a bustling street scene, this ''Measure'' keeps the traffic of the stage so brisk that it usually forbids much reflection. There is throughout, however, a feeling of the comic activity taking place within a larger, more somber frame. Even as the play begins, look beyond the canopied acting area, and you'll see the Duke, hovering in brooding isolation in the background.</p>
        <p>Similar images are stealthily introduced for the rest of the evening, suggesting that the long view of the world of ''Measure'' is less purely entertaining than the immediate evidence would have it. ''Mortality and mercy in Vienna,'' to use the Duke's phrase, may be turned into surprisingly frothy fare here. That does not preclude more serious afterthoughts when the froth has subsided.</p>
