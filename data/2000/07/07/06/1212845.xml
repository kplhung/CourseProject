        <p>Editorial says OpSail 2000, which was centerpiece of July 4 celebrations in New York City, was also its biggest disappointment because many ships began turning around well before reaching George Washington Bridge, advertised destination, out of fear of unfavorable tides (M)</p>

        <p>It was a day of tall ships, mighty explosions and big numbers.

There were a million spectators, thousands of sailors, 12,000 cops, and one president.

        <p>It was a day of tall ships, mighty explosions and big numbers. To begin with, there were more than 30,000 craft of all sizes in New York Harbor and adjoining waters, including 300 military vessels and 27 spectacular tall ships that a lot of people did not get to see. There were a million spectators, thousands of sailors, 12,000 cops, and one president. At the end of the day, 60,324 shells -- 150 tons of pyrotechnics in all -- were fired into the air on both sides of Manhattan Island, providing a deafening exclamation point to the biggest Fourth of July celebration the city has ever seen.</p>
        <p>There were some touching moments. On the carrier John F. Kennedy, Attorney General Janet Reno swore in 19 new American citizens, including Rosa Norales-Nunez, a crew member and native of Honduras. Ms. Norales-Nunez was chosen to introduce President Clinton, who then reciprocated with a message of welcome and a plea to all Americans  ''never to close the golden door behind us.''</p>
        <p>As was true of earlier OpSails, the tall ships provided the day's centerpiece -- and, this time around, its biggest disappointment. The Indonesian barque Dewaruci reached New York via the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic -- but, like the rest of the really big ships, could not muster the energy to make it as far as the George Washington Bridge. The bridge had been widely advertised by the organizers of OpSail as the flotilla's eventual destination, and thousands of people gathered in Harlem and at upriver locations on the New Jersey side to see these majestic giants sail by. But many of the big ships, led by the Eagle, an American training vessel, began turning around at about 47th Street. Some went farther, but none reached the bridge.</p>
        <p>OpSail officials said that the prospect of unfavorable tides had raised fears that the big ships would not make it back to their berths. But tides are not all that difficult to predict. In the future, the organizers should either start the procession at a different time or be a bit more honest in their advertising. It was one glitch in an otherwise glorious day.</p>
