        <p>Facing resistance from regulators in the United States and Europe to a proposed $115 billion merger, WorldCom and Sprint are planning to announce by early next week that they will abandon the deal, executives close to both companies acknowledged yesterday.</p>
        <p>The move could immediately turn the companies into takeover targets for American companies as well as foreign companies that have been seeking a foothold in the United States.</p>
        <p>Sprint, which is seen as particularly attractive because it owns a wireless telephone network in addition to its traditional fixed-line business, has received informal overtures from Deutsche Telekom of Germany and from BellSouth in the last week, according to executives close to those discussions.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone company, is mentioned as the company most likely to be a suitor despite resistance from United States legislators concerned that the German government owns more than 25 percent of the company. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, the largest communications company in Asia, is also seen as a potential suitor.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that without a deal WorldCom would have to go shopping or be shopped, and Sprint or another company like Qwest might become targets,'' said Andrew Hamerling, a telecommunications analyst with Banc of America Securities. ''But it is hard to say what the response from regulators will be if the suitor is foreign.''</p>
        <p>To measure that response, executives for WorldCom and Sprint have spent time this week talking with regulators in Europe and the United States about the issues that scuttled their merger and the implications they raised for any future deals.</p>
        <p>Still, for the time being, both Sprint and WorldCom are prevented from entering into formal merger talks with other companies until they call off their merger, according to provisions of their initial agreement. Otherwise, if one company unilaterally withdraws from the accord, it could face a $2.5 billion breakup fee. As long as neither Sprint nor WorldCom responds substantively to overtures from other companies, neither is violating the agreement.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Telekom, for one, is in no rush to do a deal. Although Ron Sommer, the company's chief executive, has a war chest of more than $100 billion and has expressed a desire to enter the United States market, executives close to the company cautioned that no bid for Sprint was imminent. He has been badly embarrassed before -- attempts to buy Telecom Italia and Qwest Communications International collapsed -- so he is expected to be particularly careful in future deal-making, the executives said, especially with such intense media attention.</p>
        <p>And Sprint is not Deutsche Telekom's only option. ''Deutsche Telekom has a very active mergers and acquisition program, and they could be in different discussions with 20 companies at the same time,'' Ian Johnston, a telecommunications analyst with J. P. Morgan, told The Associated Press. Among those it is considering is Cable and Wireless of Britain, executives close to the company said, though they stressed that no offer was imminent.</p>
        <p>If Deutsche Telekom cannot buy Sprint, which would complement the company's wireless business in Europe, it could build on overtures it has made to Qwest, based in Denver. Qwest, which completed its takeover of U S West over the weekend, would provide the company with about 29 million customers in the United States.</p>
        <p>Still, that transaction could face resistance from European regulators because of Qwest's stake in KPNQwest Telecom, a European telecommunications venture formed with Royal KPN Telecom of the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>''A Sprint purchase would fit in well with the E.U.'s concerns while a Qwest purchase might mean that Qwest would have to divest its interest in KPNQwest,'' Tony Ferrugia, a telecommunications analyst with A. G. Edwards, said, referring to the European Union.</p>
        <p>Sprint and WorldCom had hoped to announce formally their withdrawal from their merger today, though executives close to the talks said the announcement would most likely come early next week. Because of the Fourth of July holiday, some executives and lawyers are on vacation, which has made it more difficult to complete the withdrawal agreement, the executives said. They said that while both companies had worked in earnest to save the deal, it became apparent by last weekend that the deal was not salvageable.</p>
        <p>After European regulators in Brussels moved to block the transaction on the ground that it would create a giant with a stranglehold over Internet traffic, the United States Justice Department sued last week to block the deal, citing the effect it would have on long-distance and Internet costs.</p>
        <p>Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's chief executive, became increasingly convinced last week that the deal was not worth pursuing if he was forced to make the kinds of divestitures required by regulators to get approval for deal, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Sprint's chairman and chief executive, William T. Esrey, was still working through the holiday weekend to revive the deal, though his hopes that an agreement could still be reached were also dashed by the beginning of this week, executives said.</p>
