        <p>FORTUNOFF-Alan. We mourn the loss of our dear friend Alan whose actions always expressed his decency, intellect and committment to his family and the community. He will be deeply missed. We extend our heartfelt sympathy to Helene and their children. From Stuart &amp; Harriet Levine.</p>
        <p>FORTUNOFF-Alan. It is with deep personal sadness and professional regret that we mourn the passing of a long time industry colleague and friend. In the competitive field of fine jewelry retailing, Alan Fortunoff stands as an outstanding entrepreneur. He will be remembered as a man of integrity who always honored his word. Not only a businessman with drive and vision who transformed one small store into a successful chain, Alan was also a very civic-minded individual. He was a man of the community-a true philanthropist who used the position of prominence he earned for the betterment of others. Our sincere condolences to his family. We will all miss Alan. Gedalio, Sonia, Efraim and the entire Grinberg family</p>
