        <p>With the merger between Sprint and WorldCom all but called off, the question is whether Sprint executives are going to stay and, if so, for how long.</p>
        <p>When Sprint shareholders approved the $115 billion deal in April, the merger agreement specified that most of Sprint's stock options outstanding -- including those given for shares in the common stock and the wireless operations -- would become fully vested and exercisable. What does that mean? It means that Sprint executives who were given stock options as an incentive to stay with the company, can cash them in and leave.</p>
        <p>Sprint has already seen some high-level executives depart. In May, Kevin Brauer, who was president of Sprint's National Integrated Services division, left after 17 years. Two weeks ago, Sprint said that Andrew Sukawaty, the former president of the Sprint PCS Group, would leave the company to join Callahan Associates International, a firm that invests in communications and entertainment ventures. And more defections are rumored each day.</p>
        <p>Typically at Sprint, an executive there said, options vest over four years. But with Sprint's future now uncertain, competitors view this as an opportunity to swoop in and lure away some crucial talent, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, you always want to give people not only an incentive for staying, but for staying enthusiastically,'' said Richard Klugman, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''When people become vested it becomes that much tougher because they can see the pot of gold.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, Sprint wanted to ensure that its top team did not leave. Integrating two cultures during a merger can be tricky. So, some top-ranking executives, including William T. Esrey, Sprint's chief executive, signed agreements to defer exercising shares early in exchange for Sprint's offering them even more options, said E. J. Holland, Sprint's vice president for compensation benefits and labor relations. In his case, Mr. Esrey was given an additional option on 216,000 shares of Sprint common stock and 216,000 shares of the cellular operations, according to merger documents.</p>
        <p>But if the deal between Sprint and WorldCom falls apart, those options  are also fully vested and exercisable, Mr. Holland confirmed. As a result, their effectiveness becomes moot,  analysts said. But Mr. Holland warned that getting options is not a bonanza. For example, the exercise price of $61.94 for the deferred options is higher than Sprint's current stock price of $53.50. For most executives granted options in 1997, 1998 and 1999 that is not an issue.</p>
        <p>In a memorandum to clients, the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz suggested that corporate executives review rules on their stock option plans. While it may be appropriate for some corporations to vest options early, wrote Michael S. Katzke, ''for many situations where there are significant regulatory or other issues that may delay closing, such provisions may not be suitable.''</p>
