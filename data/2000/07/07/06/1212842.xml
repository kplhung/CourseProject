        <p>New York City's police seem to be making a conscientious effort to find and punish those officers who did such a poor job of protecting the women who were attacked by marauding bands of young men in Central Park last month. This is a healthy development in a department that tends to blame others when it gets into trouble.</p>
        <p>The department announced this week that it would discipline nine police officers, including six supervisors. Although none are likely to be fired, Police Commissioner Howard Safir seems serious about punishing officers who failed to aid citizens in trouble. But there are clearly more systemic problems that need addressing. Among other things, Mr. Safir must reach into the police academy itself and  strengthen that part of the training regimen that deals with sexual harassment and violence toward women.</p>

        <p>New York City's police seem to be making a conscientious effort to find and punish those officers who did such a poor job of protecting the women who were attacked by marauding bands of young men in Central Park last month. This is a healthy development in a department that tends to blame others when it gets into trouble.</p>
        <p>The department announced this week that it would discipline nine police officers, including six supervisors. Although none are likely to be fired, Police Commissioner Howard Safir seems serious about punishing officers who failed to aid citizens in trouble. But there are clearly more systemic problems that need addressing. Among other things, Mr. Safir must reach into the police academy itself and  strengthen that part of the training regimen that deals with sexual harassment and violence toward women.</p>
        <p>Several women charged that police officers whom they approached to report the assaults did nothing at a time when direct action might have prevented further attacks. Of the nine officers cited for misconduct, two were accused of failing to respond properly when the women told them about sexual assaults. One of these is accused of refusing to write a report when a victim walked into an East Side station house to say that she had been assaulted. In addition, four commanding officers who were at the scene will receive letters of censure, which become a permanent part of their personnel files. Three civilian employees will be disciplined for failing to properly classify 911 calls received regarding the melee. Mr. Safir's procedural recommendations dealt mainly with tactical issues, urging commanding officers to use helicopters and different ways of managing crowds.</p>
        <p>New techniques are fine, and better preparation for possible disturbances after the big Puerto Rican National Day parade would have been useful. But what happened also suggests that the police may not have been as sensitive to issues of gender relations, as well as to the special dangers like sexual harassment that women face, as they are to other issues. Some have also wondered whether the officers' indifference was reinforced by the fact that most of the young women were black and Hispanic.</p>
        <p>These attitudes need to be more effectively dealt with in the police academy, where new and more intensive training is clearly needed on issues of gender relations and gender-related violence.</p>
