        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your June 30 editorial about AIDS in Africa, you say the ''most immediate need is education and prevention programs.'' Too many lives are at stake to continue to prioritize prevention at the expense of treatment.</p>
        <p>There are 34 million people who are already infected with H.I.V. worldwide, 70 percent of whom live in Africa. We cannot leave them to die. There must be a balance of both treatment and prevention programs.</p>
        <p>When effective treatments exist, as they do for many H.I.V.-related illnesses, we must ensure that patients have access to them. Millions of people in the developing world die of opportunistic infections that can be easily treated, because patients cannot afford the drugs. As of now, only one drug company has significantly reduced its prices.</p>
        <p>We must pursue long-term strategies, like generic production, to bring essential medicines within the reach of the developing world. We cannot force poor nations to depend on uncertain charity.</p>
        <p>JOELLE TANGUY  New York, June 30, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is the executive director of Doctors Without Borders in the United States.</p>
