        <p>IF a sportswriter plans to write his autobiography, and believes he needs a little help, then it would seem natural for him to seek out another sportswriter. That, apparently, was what Walter Matthau did. Oddly enough, Matthau, the Tony Award and Academy Award winning actor, might be the most famous sportswriter of his time, Red Smith, Jimmy Cannon, Jim Murray and Dave Anderson notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>For many, the role of Oscar Madison -- ''the poker-playing sportswriter and all-around slob,'' as Matthau described him -- created by Matthau in both the Broadway play and the Hollywood film version of ''The Odd Couple'' in the mid-to-late 60's, remains by virtue of his acting brilliance the quintessential sportswriter.</p>
        <p>One day some 15 years ago Matthau invited me to lunch at the Beverly Hills Tennis Club. We sat at a table outdoors and under an umbrella. He was, in many ways, the Matthau I had come to know from the screen: intelligent, witty in an understated manner, with sympathetic eyes that took the measure of a man without piercing him, but, unlike Oscar, neatly dressed in a sport jacket and he knew which fork to use without making a show of it.</p>
        <p>We talked generally about sports, about acting, about language -- he loved words and recalled reading Shakespeare as a boy and not understanding it fully but being mesmerized by ''the rhythm of the language'' -- and then Matthau, in that familiar gravelly voice, said to me: ''Swifty Lazar, the literary agent, tells me that if I write my autobiography, I could make two million dollars. If you write it with me, I'll give you half.'' I was eating a bowl of borscht at that moment and nearly choked on the sour cream.</p>
        <p>Though we did work on it, we never completed the book. What we did establish, however, what we shared, was a friendship. We talked often over the years, we met, we corresponded. Then Walter took ill with pneumonia and assorted ailments and was in an induced coma for much of 38 weeks last year. He was released from the hospital and in the last few months rallied, fell back, rallied. Then last Saturday at about 4 a.m. Los Angeles time, I received a heart-wrenching phone call from his wife. I was out of town but she left a message: ''It's Carol. It's what you think. Please call.'' Walter was dead, at age 79.</p>
        <p>Matthau once told me that ''The Odd Couple'' made him a star. ''I think without that part,'' he said, ''without doing Oscar, I'd still be doing character roles on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>Matthau had, by the time the show opened on March 10, 1965, been in more than 30 films, but primarily in supporting roles. He accepted an offer to play Whiplash Willie, the unscrupulous lawyer, in ''The Fortune Cookie,'' opposite Jack Lemmon, and won an Academy Award.</p>
        <p>Matthau was a great sports fan, but, beyond that, he was addicted to gambling on sports. He admitted to being a compulsive gambler. He said that he lost $5 million in his life betting, but he earned more than $40 million. As a young stage actor he lost $185,000 on baseball games to bookies, was threatened by mobsters, and for the next six years paid them back with, he said, ''Almost every cent I made.''</p>
        <p>Matthau would sometimes have 15 television sets going in his home, each with a game on, each with a $5,000 bet on it. He'd scream at the referees, or umpires, when his bet was going South: ''You're blind! You're a crook! You're robbing me!''</p>
        <p>And then when they called a play his way: ''Oh, maybe these guys are honest.''</p>
        <p>He said that perhaps he worked so hard, and gambled so hard, because he never lost the desperation of trying to overcome poverty from growing up on the Lower East Side. (He recalled conversations with friends at the time: ''You think the rats are bad in my house, you should see the rats in that guy's house. You could put a saddle on them.'')</p>
        <p>Despite gambling, he could enjoy the artistry of an athletic performance, of the drama of the event. He marveled at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Willie Mays, among others, but his favorite player, he said, was Chubby Sherman, a classmate of his at Seward Park High School, and the school's basketball ace. ''Chubby was a dead shot,'' Matthau once told me. ''And he was blind.'' Blind? I said. ''He could hardly see. He wore glasses, but only off the court. He just got an idea of where the basket was and threw it up and it went in. Uncanny.''</p>
        <p>Matthau also played sports. He was a center fielder in the Broadway Show League for a play he was in. Henry Fonda, a friend whom he admired and with whom he had spent hours talking about acting, was a spectator at one game. Matthau came running in, as he recalls, ''to make a Willie Mays catch,'' and the ball ''hit me right between the legs.''</p>
        <p>''I went down,'' Matthau added. ''I was writhing in pain, screaming, 'Help me, oh God, help me!' A big crowd gathered and Fonda nudged me with his foot. He said, 'Walter, bring it down a little.' ''</p>
        <p>Matthau laughed when telling the story. We've all laughed for years with him. Now we shed a tear.</p>
