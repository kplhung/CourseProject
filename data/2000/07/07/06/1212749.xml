        <p>IT was just a day at the beach. And just another art and architecture event.</p>
        <p>People ate hot dogs with mustard and sauerkraut, drank cold beer, stretched and sunned. People dressed in clamdiggers, club hats, combat boots and T-shirts wrapped around their heads. A tank-topped, tattooed dad in Nike slides pushed a stroller across the gravel. A cameraman and two Japanese sound technicians with a boom recorded children splashing in a decked pool. Cell phones were as ubiquitous as shells.</p>
        <p>How was the 18-inch-deep water?</p>
        <p>''Fine,'' said Matthew Sotomayor, 5, wearing superhero underpants, doing laps on his hands and knees.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, in the cement-walled, entrance courtyard, the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City opened Dunescape, an urban beach designed by Shop, five young New York architects, as part of its Warm Up 2000 series of summer entertainments. An adjacent courtyard, where live music and guest D.J.'s will be presented, has a dance floor surrounded by sand.</p>
        <p>A slatted-cedar construction that includes a complete beach kit of chairs, changing rooms, waves, pools, ashtrays, boardwalks, umbrellas, a bar and a grove of 14-foot-tall steel poles peaked by high-pressure atomizers that mist the air like the ocean, Dunescape is a metaphoric interpretation of a trip to the shore. It is part Jules Verne invention, part Robert Moses State Park.</p>
        <p>The structure, eroding and rising like a sand dune as intended by its computer-rendered design, looks like a beach shack hit hard by a hurricane -- and still standing.</p>
        <p>Shop's semantic seashore is the first winner of the Young Architects program, a five-year series sponsored by P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art. The competitions provide architects and students an opportunity to realize experimental designs. The awarded budget for Dunescape was $50,000.</p>
        <p>This year's 20 contestants were nominated by an invited group of deans of architecture schools and editors of architecture publications. Shop was proposed by Cynthia Davidson, editor of Any, an architecture magazine published in New York six times a year. A panel that included directors of both museums, plus Terence Riley, chief curator of the department of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art, and Philip Johnson, who created last summer's courtyard dance pavilion at P.S. 1, picked the winner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley said of Dunescape: ''It has the casual architectural quality of summer. I think of beach clubs or campground structures. It blurs the distinction between architecture and landscape.''</p>
        <p>Coren Sharples of Shop said that the museums' program requirement was for ''a place where people could come who didn't have houses in the Hamptons: young artists who could come here during the week, when it was baking hot, and hang out.''</p>
        <p>Shop chose to give them a day at the beach, distilling the experience into five quintessential elements incorporated either literally or figuratively into their design: the umbrella, the cabana, the beach chair, the Boogie board and the surf.</p>
        <p>Dunescape's undulating shape, like a heat mirage shivering above a sandy blanket, continuously changes in angle across its slatted surface: six thousand 2-by-2-inch, 8-foot cedar strips, assembled with bolts, allowed the architects to flex its form like a deck chair. In the process, Dunescape provides slopes for sunning, eaves for shade, a cascading roof for running water, dips for pools and a cool, interior cave for changing clothes. Built in four weeks by eight students hired by the architects, it is oriented to the south for a ''perfect tanning position,'' Gregg Pasquarelli of Shop said.</p>
        <p>The rambling-coast, erosion-fence-like installation also presents that most personal paradox for visitors arriving at the beach for the day -- where to sit, with maximum privacy, to see and be seen. It is an exercise in architectural siting everyone knows well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pasquarelli said:''The best part about going to the beach is really not the sun or water. It's the promenade.'' People entering P.S. 1 through the courtyard will provide bathers with a ''water's edge'' promenade. In turn, bathers will be a part of Dunescape's performance, as an art piece, for passers-by.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the crowd learned quickly that black was not the best color to be wearing under a sun beating as relentlessly as drum and bass. Shirts evaporated. Armani messenger bags bit the gravel. Art-opening attitude melted like cocktail ice; reflexive beach-party behavior kicked in.</p>
        <p>J. D. Beltran, an artist visiting from San Francisco, was sitting in the latticed shadow of Dunescape with two friends, also artists, facing the pool, where aluminum deck chairs jockeyed for rubber-lined oceanfront.</p>
        <p>''There's no waves, but there's food, beautiful people, all of that,'' Ms. Beltran said, speaking over the hissing of the atomizing columns, which produced a cool fog that rolled out to Jackson Avenue. ''I grew up in Hawaii, so I guess I have particularly high standards.''</p>
        <p>How was Dunescape not like Hawaii?</p>
        <p>Ms. Beltran burst out laughing.</p>
        <p>''There are no surfers,'' she said, composing her thoughts. ''Except,'' she added, surveying the pale New York culturati with a chill eye, ''Web surfers.''</p>
        <p>P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center is at 22-25 Jackson Avenue (at 46th Avenue) in Long Island City. Dune scape will be open when the museum is open: Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 6 p.m.; suggested admission, $5. Warm Up 2000 DJ series will be presented on Saturday, from 3 to 9 p.m., through Sept. 2. Information: (718) 784-2084.</p>
