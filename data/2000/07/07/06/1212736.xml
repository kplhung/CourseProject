        <p>The spare, high-tech look is popular not only for homes and stores, but  also in gardens. ''The ultimate luxury in New York is empty space,'' said Ken Smith, a landscape architect in Manhattan. When he designed an Upper West Side garden for Joel Kissen, an owner of Guastavino's restaurant in Manhattan, and Carlos Afonso, a designer, he created an austere place made mostly of industrial materials. Yet, water burbling down aluminum runnels (next to bottom, right) and a grove of bamboo trees, planted last year, below, make the space sensuous. From top to bottom, right, Mr. Smith created a rooftop terrace overlooking the garden. Aluminum screens gleam in the sunlight, while aluminum mixing bowls ($69 from R-S Restaurant Equipment on the Bowery) have become planters for boxwood and holly. The industrial materials are not only sturdy, Mr. Smith said, but ''also fire-resistant.'' His telephone number: (212) 791-3595.</p>

        <p>CURRENTS: INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS  Correction:  July 13, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Currents column last Thursday about a garden made mostly of industrial materials misspelled the surname of one of its owners. He is Joel Kissin, not Kissen.</p>
