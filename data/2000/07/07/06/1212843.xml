        <p>The MetroStars were without four key players tonight, including Lothar Matthaus, who returned to Germany to be examined by his personal doctor while complaining of spasms in his lower back.</p>
        <p>But things have gone so splendidly for the MetroStars this season that they hardly missed the absentees. They got goals from Clint Mathis and Billy Walsh in a 2-1 triumph over Dallas that extended their winning streak to six games and their lead in the Eastern Division to 6 points.</p>
        <p>With goalkeeper Tim Howard leading the way, the MetroStars (10-7-2) played effectively throughout the game on a perfect summer night before 9,913 fans at Giants Stadium. It was the first victory in the past six games against Dallas for the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>One of the few mistakes the MetroStars made resulted in the lone goal by Dallas. It was a mental lapse by the defenders that resulted in Ted Eck's third goal of the season and it gave Dallas a 1-0 lead 24 minutes into the game.</p>
        <p>The goal came on a volley from the top of the penalty area and caught Howard leaning the wrong way. It was the first goal the goalkeeper of the MetroStars allowed in 213 minutes of action this season.</p>
        <p>Howard took over for the injured Mike Ammann three games ago after Ammann hurt his back in practice. Howard made a number of good saves against Dallas. Two were spectacular ones against Ariel Graziani in the first half and another was off a free kick by Jason Kreis with four minutes left.</p>
        <p>''I knew Graziani and Kreis would be coming and I wanted to stand up to the challenge,'' said Howard, a candidate for a spot on the United States Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Mathis scored the first goal for the MetroStars in the 31st minute, a blast from outside the penalty area after an errant clearance by Ricardo Iribarren, the central defender for Dallas.</p>
        <p>Walsh broke the tie with his second goal of the season in the 59th minute when his shot from outside the penalty area was deflected off Lazo Alavanja of Dallas, leaving goalkeeper Matt Jordan helpless.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't the prettiest, but I'll take it,'' Walsh said. ''The important thing is that it went in and we won the game.''</p>
        <p>Along with Matthaus, the MetroStars started without Thomas Dooley (left hamstring), Adolfo Valencia (right ankle) and Mark Chung (right heel). Valencia entered the game as a substitute with 14 minutes left.</p>
        <p>Matthaus was so concerned about the back spasms after practice on Monday that he returned to Germany to be examined in Munich. Nick Sakiewicz, the general manager of the MetroStars, said the team had no objection to Matthaus visiting his personal doctor.</p>
        <p>''I spoke with his doctor and he told me Lothar needs time off because a nerve is affecting his muscles,'' said Sakiewicz, who would not speculate about when Matthaus was expected to return.</p>
        <p>Matthaus, who took time off last month to play for Germany in the European Championships, has played only 10 games for the MetroStars and has only two assists.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICK</p>
        <p>The game was physical with 45 fouls, 25 by the MetroStars, and 6 yellow cards (cautions), four for the Burn.</p>
