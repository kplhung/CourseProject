        <p>RICHARD ROBINSON is an outspoken, smooth-talking ex-Yale man -- Yale was ''an aberration,'' he said, and will add nothing more -- with a polished delivery and sharp, coolly presented opinions on his love: magic.</p>
        <p>''My favorite magicians are 90 years old and baldheaded,'' Mr. Robinson said in a telephone interview. ''The older you get, the better you fit the role.'' His own age? ''I'm a year older than whatever David Copperfield says he is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson despises magic without a sense of drama: Las Vegas lounge-act magic, ''which is sort of heading into 1963 as we speak.'' He sympathizes with what he calls the thousands of lonely souls doing magic on cruise ships, and advises, ''Never work anywhere you can't send out a press release.''</p>
        <p>Any magician who quotes Arthur C. Clarke, the science fiction writer and visionary, is in the right business: Mr. Clarke, Mr. Robinson reminds us, wrote that in a sufficiently advanced society, technology becomes indistinguishable from magic.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clarke has it backwards, Mr. Robinson contends: ''Magic becomes indistinguishable from technology.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, Mr. Robinson, who lives in Manhattan, introduced the first of many Web sites, www.allmagic.com.</p>
        <p>''The mouse,'' he said, ''became the magic wand.'' He says he gets 1.5 million to 2 million hits a month on all his Web sites, with half a million regular visitors.</p>
        <p>''The nice thing about the Web,'' he said, ''is everybody's got the best seat in the house and nobody is allowed backstage.''</p>
        <p>His ''Ask Mr. Magic'' columns answer queries on subjects like levitation, coin cleaning, card forcing and showmanship. To someone asking how to get started, he suggested choosing a few classic effects, like the multiplying billiard balls or linking rings.</p>
        <p>''The classics,'' he wrote, ''tend to have a life of their own,'' whether they are close-up effects like ''card in wallet'' and ''coin in bottle'' or illusions like ''the broomstick suspension'' and ''the sword basket.''</p>
        <p>The sites are an audiovisual treat.</p>
        <p>''The last thing you want to do is disrupt the flow if it's working,'' Mr. Robinson advised performers in www.talkaboutmagic.com, warning against adding material too hastily.</p>
        <p>In another audio segment, he suggested integrating mentalism into a good magic show; ESP acts have a bad reputation, he said, because they have often relied too much on boring card tricks. ''You have to create the same kind of theater of surprise and wonder that you aspire to with a traditional magic show,'' he said of mind-reading.</p>
        <p>On www.magictheater.com, six short segments show Mr. Robinson and colleagues performing. Knives change color, strings suddenly come together, cards disappear and reappear, balls jump from cup to cup.</p>
        <p>On www.supermagic.com are tapes of Mr. Robinson doing four routines, including tearing out a paper butterfly and making it fly and making candles multiply behind a fan, in a mood reminiscent of a haunted-house film.</p>
        <p>His www.allmagicreviews.com discusses new tricks, new equipment and both classic and innovative magic books.</p>
        <p>For serious magicians, there are discussions of cards (''At no point in time have I ever done more than one card trick in an hour's performance,'' Mr. Robinson said), and techniques with hypnotic names like ''the Asher twist,'' ''the Elmsley count'' and ''the Hindu shuffle force.'' He has a dealers' guide, a searchable index called www.allmagicfinder .com (looking up ''rabbit,'' one gets a list of equipment for sale), and a calendar of magic shows and conventions, including events by the Society of American Magicians (www .magicsam.com/).</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson said he received a lot of criticism when he went online, particularly over segments in which effects are explained. Magicians thought he was giving their tricks away, even if the tricks had been invented centuries earlier. ''First of all,'' he said, ''they weren't their secrets to give away, and second of all we do not do that. Almost everything on the site is new and original magic.''</p>
        <p>Two themes stand out in Mr. Robinson's maze of U.R.L.'s: His homage to the great performers, and his emphasis on showmanship instead of  mere illusion. His favorite quote is from Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, the 19th-century French conjurer from whom Harry Houdini took his name: ''A magician is an actor playing the part of a great magician.''</p>
