        <p>Relatives of some of the 10 Jewish men sentenced to prison in Iran on espionage charges met privately with President Clinton today to build pressure against the verdicts.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. is the leader of the free world and does have some moral persuasion,'' said Malcolm I. Hoenlein, who attended the hourlong meeting as executive chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. ''The president is fully committed to doing that.''</p>
        <p>Eight relatives who live in the United States met with Mr. Clinton and his aides in the Cabinet Room. None of the relatives spoke to reporters as they left the session, but one was reached later by telephone and spoke on the condition that she not be identified for fear of reprisals against her imprisoned brother.</p>
        <p>She said of the trial, ''To me it was more like a kidnapping,'' and said of the group of prisoners: ''We're very concerned about their emotional health, as well as their physical health. We don't know how long a person can last in those conditions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has condemned the prison sentences, which were handed down on Saturday by an Iranian judge who acted as both prosecutor and jury. The 10 men were accused by the Revolutionary Court of engaging in espionage and other illegal activities on behalf of Israel. Israel has denied that the men were spies and has questioned confessions that were made by eight of the defendants without lawyers present.</p>
        <p>Administration officials acknowledged that the United States' ability to influence the case was limited. But they said Mr. Clinton's visit with the relatives was intended to show his concern about the due process of the trial and disappointment with the verdicts. ''The president said that he is fully committed to do all he can to pressure for their release,'' an administration official said after the meeting.</p>
