        <p>Criticism of the Police Department's handling of the Central Park sex attacks intensified yesterday as a group of prominent female politicians expressed dissatisfaction with the punishment meted out thus far to officers accused of misconduct or lapses in judgment.</p>
        <p>Victims of the attacks, too, said the department's treatment of those officers was insufficient.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir released the details of the department's investigation of the violent aftermath of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11, when groups of men attacked at least 59 women in or near Central Park. Mr. Safir said a dozen officers and dispatchers faced discipline for inaction or mistakes that day.</p>
        <p>In reaction to the investigation, eight women in elected office met with Mr. Safir and senior police officials yesterday morning to express their concerns. The meeting was organized by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan, who requested it two weeks ago in a letter that was signed by 21 female officials. All the women are Democrats.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's session, the women praised the department for what they described as a swift investigation, but criticized it for not suspending any of the accused officers or subjecting them to the most serious possible discipline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir has said the department's investigation is not complete. Those officers accused so far, he said, were cited for offenses ranging from improperly classifying 911 calls to inadequately supervising subordinates to sending home police officers just as the attacks in the park were reaching a frenzied pace. Two officers are also accused of not assisting victims who reported crimes to them.</p>
        <p>To date, four accused officers have been reprimanded, four face trial-like administrative hearings and four face a lesser form of discipline that could result in a loss of 10 days of vacation time. Department officials say that while the officers facing administrative trials could lose their jobs if found guilty, dismissal was unlikely. Rather, they said, possible punishments would be moderate, and could mean the loss of up to a month of vacation time or assignment to probationary status.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, speaking yesterday afternoon during an appearance with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at Public School 48 in Washington Heights, said that the department's performance on June 11 ''was not one of our best examples of policing a parade,'' but that commanders were implementing measures to prevent such problems in the future.</p>
        <p>The commissioner also said that while he assumed that officials he met with yesterday were acting in good faith, he questioned whether they were also motivated by an interest in gaining news coverage. The group held a news conference at City Hall just after the meeting ended.</p>
        <p>''Congresswoman Maloney asked me if I would work with her in the future,'' he said. ''I said I would work with anybody who is constructive and interested in doing something positive, as opposed to doing press.''</p>
        <p>At times the exchanges yesterday were testy, even personal.</p>
        <p>At one point in the meeting, Assistant Chief William Taylor Jr., the commander of detectives in Manhattan, referred to victims of the attack as ''girls,'' a reference that angered some of the women. State Assemblywoman Adele Cohen of Brooklyn said after the meeting that the wording was a patronizing indicator of insensitivity in the department.</p>
        <p>''Women -- grown women -- are referred to as women,'' she said. ''As long as law enforcement continues to think of grown women as girls, we will not get the care and respect that we deserve.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Cohen's remark was met with incredulity by police officers, who said Chief Taylor was referring to teenage victims.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman, said: ''I find it amazing, incomprehensible, that a New York City police chief should be attacked for being insensitive because he referred to teenagers as girls. That's absurd.''</p>
        <p>Police officials were also angered by a remark by City Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson of Brooklyn, who said: ''We looked at the officers that were on duty and wondered, if they were not in uniform, would they be the ones that participate in the kind of behavior that was existent in Central Park.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir called the statement inflammatory. Chief Fahey said it displayed an underlying anti-police bias. ''That type of remark shows the reverse prejudice that police officers deal with every day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Maloney's group sparred with police officials, two victims, Ashanna Cover and Josina Lawrence, both college students, held a separate news conference, in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Both women have notified the city of their intention to sue the department for negligence. They said investigators had not been forthcoming with the details of their cases.</p>
        <p>''We have been left in the dark, and nobody has talked to us in over a week,'' Ms. Cover said of the department's investigation.</p>
        <p>Another victim, Pamela N. Abrams, 42, said in a telephone interview that the investigation had singled out a small number of officers for a passive attitude that was pervasive among scores of officers at the parade. ''It's frustrating that a few people take a rap for widespread behavior,'' she said. ''I feel in some ways they let themselves off the hook by just reprimanding a few people.''</p>
