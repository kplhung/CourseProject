        <p>MLOTEK-Yosl. The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring (WC/AR) mourns the passing of foremost Yiddishist and pillar of our organization for almost half a century. Born in Poland, Yosl, forged a connection between Eastern European and American culture across generations, making Workmen's Circle the address for Yiddish in the world. He served as Educational Director of The WC/ AR, developing the Shuln Network and Jewish Cultural Experience program at Circle Lodge, innovating the Third Seder program, producing our radio program on WEVD and Yiddish Music Concerts in The Parks. Yosl leaves behind a family of tireless contributors to WC/AR, his wife, Chana, his co-editor of definitive collections of Yiddish song, sons, Zalmen, Director of Art Programming, and Mark, outgoing President, and sister, Sara, an activist in Montreal. We will miss his spirit of ageless youth.</p>
