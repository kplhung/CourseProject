        <p>The price of crude oil dropped sharply yesterday after Saudi Arabia's statement on Monday that it was ready to pump 500,000 more barrels a day, but the price did not pierce $30 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Traders and oil industry analysts said confusion remained in the market. Statements from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, some of whom object to Saudi Arabia's acting alone, raised questions about exactly how much more oil the Saudi pledge would produce.</p>
        <p>Still, some analysts contend that Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, wants to push the price of crude oil below $30 a barrel and will do what is necessary to accomplish that goal -- no matter the OPEC politics. The 11 OPEC nations have been remarkably effective of late. Their decision to restrict production beginning in March 1999 sent the price of crude oil from its 12-year low of $10.72 a barrel in December 1998 to a high of $32.72 on June 29.</p>
        <p>Oil's surge has led to higher gasoline prices, and the Saudi pledge is unlikely to bring rapid relief. The price of unleaded gasoline futures for August fell 4.74 cents a gallon, or 4.5 percent, to 99.605 cents in trading yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But analysts considered it too soon to declare a shift. One analyst even suggested that drivers might respond to falling prices by deciding to take trips they had postponed, adding to demand. ''If anything, it could have a reverse effect and lead to higher gasoline prices,'' said Dr. Gary N. Ross, chief executive of the PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consultant.</p>
        <p>Given the attention to the $30 threshold, it was notable that crude did not fall below that level. On the first day of trading since the Saudi announcement, the price of oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped $1.83, or 5.6 percent, to $30.67. After the close of futures trading yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute reported that crude oil inventories for the week ended June 30 fell 136,000 barrels, to 293 million barrels, down 34.3 million barrels from the period a year earlier. Gasoline inventories rose 2.21 million barrels, to 207.7 million barrels, down 7 million barrels from a year ago.</p>
        <p>One reason the price of oil probably did not break $30 was that Reuters reported that OPEC's president, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, said there would be no production increase until there was an agreement among all the group's members. He said he had been assured that Saudi Arabia would not act alone.</p>
        <p>''The OPEC secretary general informed me officially yesterday that there was no idea by any country to raise output unilaterally,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Rodriguez said that ''OPEC would take action'' if the price of crude oil remained above $28 a barrel ''for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the Saudi statement was ''something aimed at just capping the rally.'' The pledge did not mean the Saudis would immediately begin pumping 500,000 more barrels of oil a day, which is less than 2 percent of OPEC production.</p>
        <p>Irene King, senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, said that ''the next few days are critical'' for determining OPEC production.</p>
        <p>Among the possibilities she described was an OPEC-approved increase of 500,000 barrels a day, apportioned to all the producers. But because only Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have excess capacity, the actual increase would be closer to 250,000 barrels a day, she said.</p>
        <p>Or OPEC could approve an increase of 500,000 barrels a day by allowing countries with excess capacity to pump that much more. Or Saudi Arabia could produce 500,000 more barrels a day, and the U.A.E. and Kuwait could add 250,000 barrels a day. ''In the end, it is up to Saudi Arabia,'' she said.</p>
        <p>If the increase reaches 750,000 barrels a day, she predicted that crude would fall below $30. ''We don't collapse,'' she said, ''but it will need a special event to go over $30 again.''</p>
        <p>One reason that analysts expect some production increase is because of what has been called a gentlemen's agreement reached by OPEC members at their last meeting in June. At that meeting, the group announced it would increase daily production by 708,000 barrels, or just under 3 percent, to 25.4 million barrels. The pact excludes Iraq, which is still producing under United Nations sanctions. Because the increase was smaller than the million barrels that had been expected, the price of oil actually rose on news of the increased supply.</p>
        <p>Under a separate gentlemen's agreement, which was not announced but has been described to oil traders and analysts, OPEC would consider increasing production if the price of OPEC's basket of seven different crude oils remained above $28 for 20 days. Analysts said the big surprise was that the Saudis proposed an increase before the price had been that high for that long. The gentlemen's agreement also calls for production to be cut if the basket price falls below $22 for 10 days.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, according to some analysts, is uncomfortable with oil prices being an issue in the United States presidential election. For that reason, a production increase has been expected as political pressure in the United States has increased.</p>
