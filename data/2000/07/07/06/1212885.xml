        <p>Parents, sons, uncles and sons-in-law, retreat; customs, conceptions, morals and love, retreat. The language retreats, the language retreats, the language retreats. And we are still retreating in words and in deed, willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly: forgive them. Forgive them, Ararat!</p>

        <p>Following is an excerpt from Shahan Shahnour's 1929 novel ''Retreat Without Song,'' considered a classic about the Armenian diaspora after World War I.</p>
        <p>Parents, sons, uncles and sons-in-law, retreat; customs, conceptions, morals and love, retreat. The language retreats, the language retreats, the language retreats. And we are still retreating in words and in deed, willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly: forgive them. Forgive them, Ararat!</p>
        <p>There were Armenians who paid in gold to save their skins; there were others who gave up their faith, their virginity; there were those who abandoned their homes, their lands, their sky; there were yet cowards who denied their nation and their language, and heroes who gave their blood, their life, their very existence. While we pay, as a final ransom, that which is to come: as a final ransom, children who could have grown up, generations who could have come after us. Because those that will come in the future will be non-Armenian, in word and in deed, willingly and unwillingly, knowingly and unknowingly: forgive them, Ararat, forgive them!</p>
