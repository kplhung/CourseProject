        <p>With a new imaging technology called ImagePump, developed by Xippix of Larkspur, Calif., American history buffs can get an up-close look at one of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence, only 25 of which are known to survive, according to Sotheby's online auction site (www.sothebys.com), where the copy was sold last week for $8.14 million.</p>
        <p>The ImagePump magnifier at Sotheby's.com allows the viewer to click and drag a mouse across different areas of the page, and zoom in to see the full size print. The actual document measures 19 3/4 inches by 15 3/4 inches, but the viewable area on most computer screens is limited to a 3-inch by 3-inch box, which means only a few segments can be viewed at a time.</p>

        <p>Although it takes a few seconds for the images to load on a 56k connection, each time the mouse is moved, the ImagePump gives the viewer a clear rendering of the age spots, crease marks, print gradations across the page, and the typography peculiar to the period.</p>
        <p>Richard Minner, who developed the ImagePump technology, said it was being marketed to e-commerce and auction sites like Amazon and eBay. ImagePump also has pan, animate and spin features that can be used to display products at e-commerce sites, Mr. Minner said.</p>
