        <p>Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola crossed into the North, one of orthodox Communism's last redoubts.</p>
        <p>The precedent-setting discussions in Pyongyang, the northern capital, between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and his Communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of euphoria, and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea, a reclusive nation of 22 million.</p>
        <p>But now, major American and European businesses are again expressing deep caution. And the Coca-Cola Company, often seen as an icon of Western capitalism that helped lead the way into Communist countries like China and Vietnam, is vague about what it envisions doing in North Korea.</p>
        <p>''It is our intention to continue supplying our product to the North Korean market,'' said John Gustaveson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in South Korea. ''But at this point of time, we don't know yet.''</p>
        <p>While it will continue to watch the situation in the North, Coke said, it currently has no plans to build a bottling plant there.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola would not comment on the identity of its customers in North Korea, the people who were presumably able to taste that first batch of Coke, and this raised suspicions as to whether the drinks had reached ordinary North Koreans.</p>
        <p>But Coca-Cola acknowledged that it was paid for its products. ''It was a business transaction and not just a good-will gesture,'' Mr. Gustaveson said.</p>
        <p>Regardless of recent overtures by Seoul and Washington, officials in Pyongyang may still consider the eagerness of Western companies to do business there as a threat. As a result, some South Korean experts said, North Korea might limit the pace of change, remaining highly selective and uncompromising about the investments it accepts.</p>
        <p>''They perceive any hint of economic integration as a Trojan horse,'' said Cho Sung Ryoul, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Policy in Seoul.</p>
        <p>Last year, after Washington partly lifted trade sanctions against the North, the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea sought to send a delegation of American business representatives to Pyongyang. A year later, despite the lifting of more sanctions by Washington, the business group is still waiting for permission to visit.</p>
        <p>''We have plenty of companies that are interested,'' said Jeffrey Jones, the chamber's president. ''But it all depends on the government there.''</p>
        <p>Others said it would take more than tempting products or alluring business plans to get the Pyongyang authorities to grant access to foreign businesses. Hungry for cash to rebuild its battered economy, North Korean officials are still impressed most by hard currency up front.</p>
        <p>''They tend to believe that when you want to start a business, you come with a bag full of cash,'' said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, head of the North Korea business committee at the European Union Chamber of Commerce in South Korea.</p>
        <p>Another obstacle to investment in the North is that foreigners do not know whom to deal with. Groups from the North seeking deals with foreign investors include companies that are fronts for the Communist Party, the commerce ministry and the North Korean Army.</p>
        <p>''There's no single controlling entity,'' Mr. Grauhar said. ''It's so confusing for foreign companies that the business becomes more limited.''</p>
        <p>As a representative of a French trading company, Mr. Grauhar lived in Pyongyang for seven years, where he also served as a consultant for other foreign companies wanting to enter the North Korean market. He cautioned that even those companies that gain access to Northern business representatives will face surprises. Some business practices common in North Korea are likely to bedevil foreign executives.</p>
        <p>For instance, the North Koreans prefer to meet in hotels and not in their offices, making it difficult to gauge the size of the companies they say they represent. The background and the role of these representatives may also be hard to ascertain.</p>
        <p>''It's very important to cross-check everything, that you speak to the right person who has the decision-making powers that he says he has,'' Mr. Grauhar said. ''It takes time, and you have to meet them again and again.''</p>
        <p>Yoon Sang Ryul, a deputy manager at the Hyundai Asan Company, which oversees the North Korean business interests of the Hyundai group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, said decision-making in the North is cumbersome and often difficult for outsiders to understand.</p>
        <p>''Everything progresses from bottom to top by reaching a consensus at each level,'' he said, ''and outsiders are not allowed into the consensus-forming group. Initially, it is important to build relationships rather than focusing on profit-driven models.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cho at the Institute for National Security Policy said foreign businesses considering investments in North Korea would do well to remember what South Korea was like in the late 1960's, when its relatively backward economy was being developed under the military dictatorship of Gen. Park Chung Hee.</p>
        <p>''The North Koreans seem to have studied Park Chung Hee's economic plan very carefully,'' Mr. Cho said. ''The core of his leadership was introducing a market-based economy while maintaining an authoritarian rule.''</p>
        <p>General Park used his powers to ensure that concentrating investment in a handful of industries and companies most likely to encourage fast economic growth did not lead to social and political unrest. And Mr. Cho said that foreigners looking to do business in the North should expect to operate within the parameters established by a totalitarian government.</p>
        <p>Beyond those considerations, the North -- while it has a large, well-trained work force -- has none of the infrastructure that modern business relies on. The South Korean central bank estimates that it will cost more than $50 billion over the next decade to create the modern manufacturing base, telecommunications and other infrastructure needed to make foreign investment a success.</p>
