        <p>After a spring of ever-shifting strategies and messages, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat, populist themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gore criticized drug companies for the second time in three days, accusing them of ''price gouging'' and putting ''millions of dollars'' into a ''phony'' group ''which is polluting the public airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to deceive the American people about a prescription drug benefit.''</p>

        <p>After a spring of ever-shifting strategies and messages, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat, populist themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gore criticized drug companies for the second time in three days, accusing them of ''price gouging'' and putting ''millions of dollars'' into a ''phony'' group ''which is polluting the public airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to deceive the American people about a prescription drug benefit.''</p>
        <p>Last week he crusaded against ''Big Oil,'' suggesting that high fuel prices in the Midwest could be due to collusion. Before that he portrayed himself as acting on behalf of economically pressed Americans, ''not just the ones who think comfortably about their savings over Scotch in the club.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's populist appeals have allowed him to speak in a voice distinct from President Clinton's, tying the vice president back to his own record in Congress where, as a young lawmaker, he fought excessive drug company profits.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, when he ran for re-election, Mr. Clinton largely shied away from such pointed appeals to class and against the powerful when his advisers decided that the election should be fought on issues of values.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore faces challenges Mr. Clinton did not. Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore has been lagging slightly behind his Republican opponent in recent polls, in part because Democrats are not rallying behind him as enthusiastically as Republicans are supporting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And, on his left, Mr. Gore has to contend with Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running on the Green Party line. Mr. Nader is drawing about 5 percent in the polls, but some Gore supporters fear that, in a tight race, even a small percentage could hurt Mr. Gore in key states.</p>
        <p>So the vice president's advisers and Democratic supporters say the themes now being sounded by the vice president serve several purposes. For one, they are supposed to stoke the perception that Mr. Bush, whose campaign has raised record sums, is the candidate of the well off.</p>
        <p>''He's taken $90 million in this campaign, which is unprecedented, and time and again he took the side of the special interests,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman.</p>
        <p>The tones also rally the Democratic faithful. Mr. Gore appeared today before some of his party's staunchest supporters, a teachers union gathering here in Philadelphia, and a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati. The audience at the American Federation of Teachers convention here was often cheering as Mr. Gore criticized the insurance industry or pledged to give all children health insurance. And though aides say it is not Mr. Gore's primary intent, the attack on corporate interests co-opts some of Mr. Nader's anti-corporate message.</p>
        <p>By portraying himself as a fighter for the common man against big business, Mr. Gore also takes one of his vulnerabilities -- that he can seem strident -- and tries to turn it into a plus. As he put it several times this week, ''The question is whether you're for the people or for the power.''</p>
        <p>The risk is one that Mr. Clinton's strategists identified four years ago when they argued that class-based appeals did not get a Democratic candidate above 50 percent with the voters because they started to turn off as many people as they rallied.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's aides say that, despite his comment about Scotch drinkers at their club, he is more often taking on corporate interests that the public distrusts than he is the well-to-do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides say these themes will resonate with swing voters as much as with Democrats.</p>
        <p>''These issues are core Democratic issues,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, ''but they appeal to voters across the board.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore is no longer criticizing Mr. Bush head-on, the way he did in the spring when he spoke of Mr. Bush's ''risky'' tax scheme and criticized every Bush proposal. Instead, he goes after certain business interests that he then tries to link to either the Congressional Republicans or to Mr. Bush, or both.</p>
        <p>Today much of his fire was against Citizens for Better Medicare, a group that, despite its name, was started by drug manufacturers. It has spent more than $2 million in recent weeks on television advertisements opposing the Democrats' plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare that was distributed on his campaign plane, Mr. Gore challenged the group's leaders to make public its donor list and show who was behind it, saying, ''The American people deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this critical issue.''.</p>
        <p>In his appearance before the teachers, Mr. Gore said the group should be called Citizens for Bad Medicare, saying, ''That's what they are promoting -- our opponent's plan, which tells seniors to go beg the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies with help with prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was referring to the House Republicans' plan for a prescription drug benefit, which broadly follows principles Mr. Bush has set out. Their bill gives subsidies and incentives to insurance companies to provide drug coverage to Medicare recipients. Mr. Gore has a more expansive plan which would offer the benefits directly through the Medicare program.</p>
        <p>Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said it was reviewing Mr. Gore's letter to decide on a response.  Mr. Zielinski said the coalition had not disguised its drug company backing.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Gore was delivering his criticisms, Democratic officials sought to demonstrate ties between the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans. They said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who helped produce the commercials for Citizens for Better Medicare, had ties to the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Castellanos's firm, National Media, had no part in the production of Mr. Bush's campaign advertisements.</p>
        <p>One Bush adviser acknowledged that the company did buy media time  for the Bush campaign, but said Mr. Castellanos was on the ''creative side'' of the company and was not involved in buying time for the Bush commercials.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLellan accused Mr. Gore of trying to ''divert attention away from his Washington, D.C., one-size-fits-all'' approach to providing a drug benefit directly through the federal Medicare program. Mr. McClellan also accused three of Mr. Gore's friends and advisers -- Peter Knight, Tom Downey and Anthony Podesta -- of being drug industry lobbyists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, however, noted that the vice president was acting in opposition to the drug industry despite the ties of some of his friends and advisers. But Mr. Lehane asserted that the Bush campaign was benefiting from the Citizens for Better Medicare advertisements, and was putting forward ''an agenda that is in the best interests of the pharmaceutical companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Knight previously worked for the Schering-Plough Corporation but has since left the lobbying business.</p>
