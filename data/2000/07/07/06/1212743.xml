        <p>The marble walls of the Empire Room on the 24th floor of the F. W. Woolworth Building glow, just as they did in 1913 when the architect Cass Gilbert designed the skyscraper, then the highest in the world. But what happens within those walls has changed strikingly. In the 1930's, C. W. Deyo, the president of F. W. Woolworth, left, used the 30-by-20-foot room as his office. This spring, when Xceed, an  e-commerce company, rented four floors in the building,  it didn't know whether to turn the room over to the C.E.O. or to make it available to all employees.</p>
        <p>The final decision, said Jonathan Molod, the executive managing director of Xceed, was, ''it was too over the top to use as anyone's office.'' And so it became a lounge furnished with a putting green, video games, a television and a popcorn machine. It's for staff only (233 Broadway).</p>
