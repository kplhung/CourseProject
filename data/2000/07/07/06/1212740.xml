        <p>A garage can be a home for all things. From 1991 to March of this year, what had been a truck garage was the Gagosian gallery, with artworks from $30,000 up to millions of dollars. Last week, the 4,700-square-foot space, at 136 Wooster Street, became the new home for Ad Hoc Softwares, a home furnishings shop with honey-scented soaps for $5, steel day beds with futons for $690 (suitable for short minimalists only), and Pierre Bouguennec's 60's-inspired inflatable plastic screen (left, $995). Michael Pierce, a Manhattan architect, far left, kept the space open, airy and painted white. The owners, Julia McFarlane, center, and Judy Auchincloss, right, opened the original Ad Hoc, at 410 West Broadway, in 1982. Forced out of that rented space, the two women bought the building this time; (212) 982-7703.</p>
