        <p>President Clinton's convening of a summit meeting between Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, next week will usefully quicken the pace of Mideast peace negotiations two months ahead of the deadline both sides have set for a final agreement. As Mr. Clinton noted yesterday, standing still is not an option in the quest for Middle East peace. Like Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt when they gathered at Camp David at President Carter's invitation 22 years ago, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat must summon the courage to make difficult compromises or risk losing a historic opportunity to end the half-century-old conflict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has long sought such a meeting, believing it could help hold together his fractious cabinet and revive a negotiating momentum that has been ebbing. Yesterday's resignation threat by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky underscored Mr. Barak's problems. Mr. Arafat also recognizes that only the two top leaders can make the decisions necessary for peace. But he had argued that more groundwork needed to be laid in lower-level talks before a useful summit meeting could be held.</p>

        <p>President Clinton's convening of a summit meeting between Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, next week will usefully quicken the pace of Mideast peace negotiations two months ahead of the deadline both sides have set for a final agreement. As Mr. Clinton noted yesterday, standing still is not an option in the quest for Middle East peace. Like Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt when they gathered at Camp David at President Carter's invitation 22 years ago, Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat must summon the courage to make difficult compromises or risk losing a historic opportunity to end the half-century-old conflict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has long sought such a meeting, believing it could help hold together his fractious cabinet and revive a negotiating momentum that has been ebbing. Yesterday's resignation threat by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky underscored Mr. Barak's problems. Mr. Arafat also recognizes that only the two top leaders can make the decisions necessary for peace. But he had argued that more groundwork needed to be laid in lower-level talks before a useful summit meeting could be held.</p>
        <p>Those lower-level talks have now reached their limit. Forward movement has stalled, leaks about possible Israeli territorial concessions have raised resistance and both sides have resorted to strident rhetoric over a possible Palestinian declaration of statehood. Under these circumstances, the White House was right to move for an early meeting.</p>
        <p>The main issues to be resolved are competing claims to Jerusalem, borders between Israeli and Palestinian territory, the future of Jewish settlements and the rights of Palestinian refugees. Settling them will require compromises that will leave neither side happy but that both sides can live with.</p>
        <p>The Camp David meetings begin next Tuesday and could run anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, with President Clinton participating on a regular basis. Any peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians produced under his auspices would enhance Mr. Clinton's place in history. But the importance of achieving Mideast peace should transcend personality or partisanship. Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would be wise to give full support to Mr. Clinton's peacemaking efforts.</p>
        <p>Achieving a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians would crown decades of Mideast diplomacy and resolve the central conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Much of the preliminary work is done, but the remaining issues are excruciatingly difficult. The passage of time is unlikely to make them easier to resolve.</p>
