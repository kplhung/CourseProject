        <p>SUNNYVALE  The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family  By Jeff Goodell  252 pages. Villard. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In his perceptive memoir of growing up in a household that was postnuclear with a vengeance, Jeff Goodell refers to ''my train wreck of a family'' and illustrates why that is, if anything, an understatement. Mr. Goodell begins this account with his mother's decision to walk out on his father, a choice she explained years later by saying, ''I wanted to dance.'' Then he describes the way he, his brother, sister and their parents went into free fall from there. Years later he took his future wife to a party at which everyone seemed to have had serial spouses, and she exclaimed, ''They're so decadent!''  He replied, ''Welcome to California.''</p>

        <p>SUNNYVALE  The Rise and Fall of a Silicon Valley Family  By Jeff Goodell  252 pages. Villard. $24.95.</p>
        <p>In his perceptive memoir of growing up in a household that was postnuclear with a vengeance, Jeff Goodell refers to ''my train wreck of a family'' and illustrates why that is, if anything, an understatement. Mr. Goodell begins this account with his mother's decision to walk out on his father, a choice she explained years later by saying, ''I wanted to dance.'' Then he describes the way he, his brother, sister and their parents went into free fall from there. Years later he took his future wife to a party at which everyone seemed to have had serial spouses, and she exclaimed, ''They're so decadent!''  He replied, ''Welcome to California.''</p>
        <p>And not just any part of California: the Goodells lived in the town of the title, with a name that becomes unavoidably mocking as ''Sunnyvale'' progresses, not only for its cheery sound but also for its Silicon Valley geography. It happens that the author's paternal grandfather, Leonard, worked with Enrico Fermi, held a distinguished position with Westinghouse and was never seen by his grandson in anything other than dark slacks, white shirt and a thin, dark tie.</p>
        <p>''All in all, the old man looked like the primal nerd, which was exactly what he was,'' writes Mr. Goodell, though he comes to regard his remote grandfather with surprising affection by the time this sad, enveloping book is over. With more empathy than anger, he points out that when one of Leonard's sons died, Leonard needed to call directory assistance to find the phone numbers of his other children. This was pretty much par for the course within a family heavily rooted in Silicon Valley, to the point where the author's father suffered professional humiliation when his wife left him. At the same time, she was also starting a promising career with an up-and-coming computer company called Apple.</p>
        <p>On an all too typical morning, visiting his mother at her new home, Mr. Goodell notices the knickknacks: ''Like many other objects in her condo -- Christmas ornaments, key chain, T-shirts, sweatshirts, her plastic ID badge -- the coffee mug was emblazoned with the rainbow-colored Apple Computer logo. On mornings such as this, the logo contrasted mightily with the decidedly unrainbow-like expression on her face.''  This time, the bad news has to do with Jill, the author's teenage sister, who has begun to act out her resentment of her mother's boyfriends and soon gets into trouble at school, even landing in the Santa Clara County Jail one Halloween. When Jill was growing up, Mr. Goodell writes, she found more of a family atmosphere within the Apple corporate culture, hanging around at her mother's office, than she did at home.</p>
        <p>In a clear-eyed account of what might beset an unraveling American family anywhere but was certainly made worse by Silicon Valley's brand of success-driven self-absorption, Mr. Goodell explains how he became more straitlaced in response to the problems of his younger brother, Jerry. In an increasingly hellish account of Jerry's downward spiral, he tells how difficult it was for Jerry to fit in, even from the start. ''The sons and daughters of aerospace engineers were all lousy baseball players and lame free-throw shooters, too,'' he writes. ''They were interested in chemistry sets and ham radios and other hand-me-down garage gizmos. But whatever gene makes a kid seek transcendence through wires and circuits, Jerry didn't have. He was even more allergic to technology than I was.''</p>
        <p>Thus, while the author quit an early job at Apple because he found the place ''just IBM with long hair'' and later gravitated toward journalism, Jerry felt the need for real defiance. He became, among other things, a most unlikely gigolo, claiming to specialize in the neglected wives of Silicon Valley high-tech types. He drifted into drugs, alcohol and scary volatility, which Mr. Goodell captures here with chilling precision.</p>
        <p>''You gotta help me, man,'' a phone call from Jerry might go. ''I haven't eaten anything but a bag of hamburger buns in a week.'' Or: ''I'm standing next to an overpass. How would you like it if I jumped?'' Without the can-you-top-this braggadocio of too many dysfunctional family stories, Mr. Goodell looks back at his brother's unhappiness and fury and summons them forcefully. ''Someday, I want to understand what happened to him,'' said the author's father about Jerry. But by that point it was much too late for both of them.</p>
        <p>In a book that vividly characterizes a new, fumbling, casually disconnected style of family life and ponders its ultimate price (when he sees a relative after a long absence, that relative has usually undergone some dramatic transformation), the author's once-scorned father emerges as an unlikely hero. Only in the course of telling this story does Mr. Goodell seem to add up his father's accomplishments, realizing that the foremost one was simply sticking around. Having initially shared his mother's disdain for a man who seemed boring and, by Silicon Valley standards, unsuccessful, he comes to respect and even celebrate his father's quiet devotion.</p>
        <p>''At every turn, he had chosen family over work,'' he writes. ''It was a choice that might have worked out fine in Portland, Ore., but in Silicon Valley it was like choosing to breathe water rather than air.''</p>
