        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin made a surprise trip to the Mozdok military base near Chechnya tonight to review the deteriorating security situation in the breakaway republic.</p>
        <p>He convened a meeting of top aides, a presidential spokesman said, to consider military and economic steps to secure Russia's hold on Chechnya, where Russian forces have waged a 10-month campaign against separatist rebels.</p>
        <p>The meeting followed a string of bombings last Sunday against Russian bases and checkpoints that left at least 33 dead, shocked the nation and illustrated that Russia has only a tenuous hold on much of the territory nominally under its control.</p>
        <p>Today, an emotional funeral was held in Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, home to many of the soldiers killed in Sunday's attacks in Chechnya. Mr. Putin sent condolences to families of victims but otherwise said little about the latest rebel attacks.</p>
        <p>The meeting in Mozdok included Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev; Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo; the chairman of Mr. Putin's Security Council, Sergei Ivanov; and the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Gennadi Troshev. Akhmad Kadyrov, who was appointed by Mr. Putin to administer Chechnya, was also on hand. Mr. Putin had flown to Mozdok from Tajikistan, where he attended a summit meeting of Central Asian leaders. Some of Mr. Putin's senior aides accompanied him to that meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin was elected largely on his reputation as a tough, former intelligence chief who promised to restore Russian pride and defeat the Chechen rebels. But instead of a speedy and decisive victory, Chechnya has turned into a quagmire.</p>
        <p>Today, Russian officials sought to prepare the population for more fighting and casualties. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Russian government spokesman, said that the rebels were taking advantage of Chechnya's thick summer foliage.</p>
        <p>''We have to expect a strike from behind at all times,'' Mr. Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
        <p>After the Sunday attacks, one by a suicide truck bomb, Russian authorities instituted a shoot-on-sight evening curfew and increased bombing raids. Russian news reports today said one Russian military truck had been damaged by a mine and that some soldiers had been injured.</p>
