        <p>Manager Joe Torre is nearsighted about the Yankees' pitching rotation because injuries and ineffectiveness have not allowed him to look far ahead.</p>
        <p>Less than 20 hours before this afternoon's game against the Baltimore Orioles, Torre said that the left-hander Ed Yarnall would make his first appearance for the Yankees this season. And Torre did not rule out the possibility that Dwight Gooden might start the day game of Saturday's doubleheader against the Mets at Shea Stadium, adding him to the mix that includes Jason Grimsley and the rookie Ben Ford.</p>
        <p>But Torre was thinking of today first as the Yankees recalled Yarnall from Class AAA Columbus. Last year, Yarnall pitched three times with the Yankees, winning his first major league start on Sept. 5.</p>
        <p>He went into spring training considered the No. 5 starter this year but promptly lost the spot with a dismal spring as he hurt his lower back. But, Torre said, Yarnall is 100 percent now.</p>
        <p>''He's been pitching well lately,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Yarnall last started for Columbus on Saturday, when he gave up four runs in two and two-thirds innings but got a no-decision in a Clippers victory at Toledo. He is 1-1 with a 5.31 earned run average in nine starts with Columbus.</p>
        <p>''After last year, he figured prominently in our plans for spring training, but he never made the grade,'' Torre said yesterday. ''A lot of it was because he wasn't healthy. He's pitched well the last three times, and hopefully that will translate tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Grimsley pitched one-third of an inning in the Yankees' 12-6 triumph over the Orioles last night, facing four batters and giving up three hits and two runs.</p>
        <p>After the game, Torre addressed Grimsley's availability for Saturday's start. ''He could still go,'' he said. ''We'll have to see.''</p>
        <p>Of Gooden, whose minor league contract the Yankees purchased last month, Torre said: ''Doc's doing well. Sure he's a possibility.''</p>
        <p>The right-hander Ramiro Mendoza, who is on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder tendinitis, reported no stiffness in his shoulder when throwing yesterday, Torre said, an encouraging sign for his return after the All-Star Game break next week.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the veteran David Cone, who has not won since April, took batting practice yesterday in preparation for his scheduled Sunday start against the Mets.</p>
        <p>Torre is sticking with Cone, and said he did not consider sending Cone to the bullpen. ''He's earned that, no question, because he's David Cone,'' Torre said. ''He's not somebody who's auditioning. He has numbers in the book in tough situations.''</p>
        <p>Hobbled Spencer Sits</p>
        <p>Shane Spencer's right knee, which he banged into the left-field fence chasing Mike Bordick's home run Tuesday night, was still swollen and kept him out of the starting lineup last night. X-rays on the knee were negative.</p>
        <p>David Justice started in left field for Spencer and had a double in four at-bats. Chuck Knoblauch was 1 for 4 as the designated hitter and Jose Vizcaino started at second base and was 2 for 4 with one run batted in.</p>
        <p>Posada an All-Star Reserve</p>
        <p>After Tuesday's loss to the Orioles, Joe Torre told catcher Jorge Posada to come see him before last night's game. Posada did not ask why. But he hoped. ''I couldn't sleep last night,'' Posada said, beaming.</p>
        <p>At 4 p.m. yesterday, Torre ended the suspense by telling Posada he had chosen him as an American League All-Star team reserve. Torre, who will manage the A.L. team in Tuesday night's game in Atlanta, also picked Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter and the reliever Mariano Rivera. They will join center fielder Bernie Williams, who was voted in as a starter. It was Rivera's third All-Star selection and Jeter's third straight.</p>
        <p>''This is very special for me,'' said the 28-year-old Posada, whose voice was choked with emotion. ''This is a big deal for me.''</p>
        <p>Posada is batting .314, with 39 R.B.I. and 14 home runs. He walked three times last night.</p>
        <p>Torre chose him over the Orioles' Charles Johnson, whose numbers -- .313 average, 46 R.B.I., 20 home runs  -- are slightly better than Posada's.</p>
        <p>''It's always tough that you have to leave people off,'' Torre said. ''But when your player has equal numbers with players on another team, I've got to take my player. It may be the wrong thing, but to me it was something I felt I had to do.''</p>
        <p>Torre pored over player statistics and the fan balloting to fill out the All-Star roster. Cleveland's Sandy Alomar, was second to Ivan Rodriguez of Texas in the voting for catchers, but Alomar has been battling injuries this year. Posada was third in the voting. ''To me, that gives me the out,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Posada said he was thrilled to be on the same team as Rodriguez, his mentor, who is also from the same hometown, Rio Piedras, P.R.</p>
        <p>''Just to be his backup is a great honor,'' Posada said.</p>
        <p>Jeter was low key about his own selection. ''It feels good,'' he said. ''I'd be lying if I said it didn't.''</p>
        <p>But he was more excited for his friend Posada than for himself. ''I'm so proud of him, especially after what kind of a year he had last year,'' Jeter said.</p>
        <p>''They're not happier than I am,'' Posada said.</p>
