        <p>Cameron Crowe's new, still-untitled film, based on his own experiences as a young journalist traveling with a rock band in the early 1970's, will get its world premiere at this year's Toronto International Film Festival.  It is among a handful of movies whose inclusion in the festival's 25th anniversary season, which runs from Sept. 7 to 16, was announced this week.</p>
        <p>The Toronto festival has grown in recent years to become the top showcase for many of Hollywood's fall and holiday-season films. Its audiences get the first look at many of the movies that end up as Academy Award contenders. Last year, ''American Beauty'' was a festival highlight and went on to dominate the Oscars; other festival screenings included Norman Jewison's ''Hurricane'' and Lasse Hallstrom's ''Cider House Rules.''</p>
        <p>Piers Handling, the festival's director, announced that Mr. Crowe's film would be joined at this year's festival by ''Best in Show,'' a mock documentary from Christopher Guest about the world of dog shows; ''The Contender,'' a political drama from the writer-director Rod Lurie about a senator facing a sex scandal, starring Joan Allen and Gary Oldman; and ''The Luzhin Defense,'' Marleen Gorris's drama about an Italian chess player, based on a novel by Vladimir Nabokov.</p>
        <p>''Stardom,'' Denys Arcand's drama about the skyrocketing career of a young model, starring Dan Aykroyd, Frank Langella and Jessica Pare, will be the opening-night attraction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crowe's film, his first since ''Jerry Maguire'' in 1996, stars Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand and Jason Lee. It is about a teenage boy sent on assignment by Rolling Stone magazine in 1973.</p>
        <p>DreamWorks, the studio that used the Toronto festival as a springboard for ''American Beauty'' last year, plans a similar release pattern for Mr. Crowe's film, opening it in New York and Los Angeles on Sept. 15, less than a week after its Toronto premiere, and then expanding to major United States cities on Sept. 22 and to a wide release on Sept. 29.</p>
