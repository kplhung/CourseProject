        <p>AKS-Harold. Choral conductor and educator. 78, died Friday, June 30, 2000, of heart failure while vacationing in Canada. Mr Aks was a prominent figure in the New York musical world for over 50 years. He lost his beloved wife of 28 years, Patricia, in 1994. He is survived by sister and brother-in-law Esther and Robert Ray, daughter and son-in-law, Catherine Aks and Stanley Kushel, granddaughter, Miriam, son and daughter-in-law, David Aks and Ann Baltz, grand daughter, Julia, stepson, Michael Untermeyer, step daughter and son-in-law, Kathryn Untermeyer Atwood and James Atwood, grandsons, Samuel and Ethan, and his loving companion Lorie Hartman who made his last years so special. A memorial service will be held on Friday, July 7, at 10 AM at ''The Riverside'', 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.</p>
        <p>AKS-Harold. Mentor. Arbiter. Good friend. Poker buddy. One of life's joy givers. He will be missed. Irene and George Fine</p>
        <p>AKS-Harold. The Dalton School is saddened by the loss of one of its most dedicated and loved teachers, Harold Aks. For over half a century, Harold inspired his students with a love of music and encouraged them to reach extraordinary levels in their musical performances. His magnetic personality and humor drew students and faculty to his side and brought them back to Dalton to sing under his direction. Following his retirement in 1997, Harold continued as the Director of the Alumni Chorus and was chosen this past spring by the Alumni Association to be honored as a former faculty member. Harold has touched the lives of so many students and brought such beautiful music to the school that it is hard to think of the place without him.</p>
