        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group said yesterday that it would let its former partners sell as many as 18 million shares of stock in an offering that could be bigger than the firm's $3.66 billion initial public offering last year.</p>
        <p>But this time, the firm will not get any of the proceeds. The shares being offered for sale -- 40 million plus an optional 6 million more -- are owned by two big institutions and people who were partners in the firm when it went public or who already had retired as partners.

        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group said yesterday that it would let its former partners sell as many as 18 million shares of stock in an offering that could be bigger than the firm's $3.66 billion initial public offering last year.</p>
        <p>But this time, the firm will not get any of the proceeds. The shares being offered for sale -- 40 million plus an optional 6 million more -- are owned by two big institutions and people who were partners in the firm when it went public or who already had retired as partners. Many of those shares were not supposed to be sold for another two years.</p>
        <p>The sale, which is expected to occur in early August, could push down Goldman's stock price as the supply of stock available to the public increases. Only about 17 percent of Goldman's shares are now owned by outsiders. The other 83 percent are held by the firm's current and former employees, a Hawaiian trust called the Kamehameha Activities Association and Sumitomo Bank of Japan.</p>
        <p>The Kamehameha association, an affiliate of the Bishop estate in Honolulu, is selling half of its 4.9 percent stake in Goldman, and Sumitomo is selling 40 percent of its 6.3 percent stake.</p>
        <p>Goldman officials declined to comment on the proposed sale.</p>
        <p>After several years of internal struggle over whether to convert from a partnership to a public corporation, Goldman sold 69 million shares of stock for $53 each in May 1999. Since then, Goldman's stock has risen 81 percent, to $95.9375 yesterday. At that price, the sale could raise more than $4.4 billion.</p>
        <p>After the sale, Goldman's management will control 60 percent of the firm.</p>
        <p>In documents related to its first-time stock sale, Goldman said that it would restrict its former partners from selling the shares they received in the conversion for three years. But now it plans to let them sell 12 million to 18 million shares, which would be worth $1.15 billion to $1.73 billion at the current stock price.</p>
        <p>The registration document that Goldman filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the stock market closed yesterday did not disclose how many shares each of the former partners and retired partners planned to sell. A person close to the company said most of them would sell less than 7 percent of their shares and none would sell more than 15 percent.</p>
