        <p>What were those tracks you saw in the dirt? At enature.com (www.enature.com), curious animal lovers can view field guides for any ZIP code. There are pictures and details about range and behavior for each mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian in the guide.</p>
        <p>Some of the lists could use refinement. A ZIP code query for 10128, on Manhattan's east side, showed species like the white-tailed deer, which is rarely spotted on Park Avenue. To its credit, the field guide also included such present-day residents as the common raccoon, the Eastern gray squirrel and the Norway rat, which numbers in the thousands in New York.</p>
