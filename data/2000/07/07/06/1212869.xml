        <p>Maybe, the idea of playing the Portland Fire, an expansion team that has managed to win only four games this season, lulled the New York Liberty into a sense of complacency last night. Or maybe, it was just too much familiarity between the two teams. After all, there were three former Liberty players -- Sophia Witherspoon, Michele Van Gorp and Carolyn Young -- playing for Portland, and one former member of the Fire, Tari Phillips, playing for the Liberty. It appeared there were more hugs tossed about than practice shots before the game at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, the Liberty played the first half like the new kids in the league, shooting only 36 percent from the field and turning the ball over 17 times. The Liberty certainly reflected Witherspoon's assessment of her former team as ''lacking in chemistry'' and the kind of defensive hustle that took it to two championship rounds. By halftime, the score was tied at 24 with Witherspoon leading all scorers with 8 points.</p>

        <p>Maybe, the idea of playing the Portland Fire, an expansion team that has managed to win only four games this season, lulled the New York Liberty into a sense of complacency last night. Or maybe, it was just too much familiarity between the two teams. After all, there were three former Liberty players -- Sophia Witherspoon, Michele Van Gorp and Carolyn Young -- playing for Portland, and one former member of the Fire, Tari Phillips, playing for the Liberty. It appeared there were more hugs tossed about than practice shots before the game at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, the Liberty played the first half like the new kids in the league, shooting only 36 percent from the field and turning the ball over 17 times. The Liberty certainly reflected Witherspoon's assessment of her former team as ''lacking in chemistry'' and the kind of defensive hustle that took it to two championship rounds. By halftime, the score was tied at 24 with Witherspoon leading all scorers with 8 points.</p>
        <p>But the defending Eastern Conference champions managed to show up for the second half and put Portland in its familiar place, next to last in the Western Conference. New York found its chemistry and its range and came away with a 62-45 victory.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon and Vickie Johnson led all scorers with 15 points each as the Liberty shot 44 percent. Phillips, the W.N.B.A. player of the week, had 12 points and 10 rebounds, as well as 5 of New York's season-high 14 steals.</p>
        <p>Witherspoon, who admitted to being nervous over returning to the Garden, finished with 9 points, a team high, and two assists.</p>
        <p>The lovefest reunion came to an abrupt end after Liberty guard Teresa Weatherspoon, the league's two-time defensive player of the year, told Vicky Johnson, the team's leading scorer, what Witherspoon had told reporters before the game: something about the new-look Liberty lacking chemistry.</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon believes her former teammate, whom she welcomed back with open arms, was merely trying to motivate her Fire teammates. Instead, it served to motivate New York, which methodically increased its lead after moving to a 30-25 advantage early in the second half.</p>
        <p>''The offense was very good tonight,'' Coach Richie Adubato said. ''In fact, we almost over-passed. We like to see that because that means everyone is playing unselfishly. We also penetrated and dished and made some nice pass backs.''</p>
        <p>Witherspoon played her first three W.N.B.A. seasons with the Liberty, and led the team in scoring in her first two seasons. But when she struggled at the start of last season, Witherspoon was replaced in the starting lineup by Crystal Robinson, who had been a star in the defunct American Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>And in April, Witherspoon was picked by the Fire in the expansion draft, along with Van Gorp. ''It feels good to be back,'' said Witherspoon, who celebrated her 31st birthday yesterday and was greeted with cheers from the fans. ''This is where everything began for me as far as the W.N.B.A.''</p>
