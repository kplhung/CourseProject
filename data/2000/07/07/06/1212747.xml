        <p>GEORGE ORWELL expected Soviet-style Communism to perfect the notion of a society monitored by an all-seeing ''big brother,'' but he did not realize that it would take capitalism to come up with the most efficient way for millions of people to be nosy.</p>
        <p>What capitalism has come up with is the aptly named ''Big Brother,'' CBS's spinoff of a television show that was first created in the Netherlands and is already wildly popular across Europe. The first show in the United States was shown last night.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, 10 strangers moved into the house where they will live for three months with virtually no contact with the outside world. The house was built for the show on the network's lot in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles. Privacy is nonexistent; the participants are under total video surveillance, even when sleeping, showering or using the toilet.</p>
        <p>Whether one thinks that this concept is a brilliant way to observe the workings of the human psyche or a tremendous waste of time for the broadcasters, the participants and the audience, there is no denying that the creation of nightly shows detailing the previous 24 hours in 10 people's lives is an extraordinary technical and logistical challenge.</p>
        <p>The participants who entered the house cannot leave unless they quit voluntarily or are voted out by viewers. The house has two windowless bedrooms (how they're shared is up to the group), one shower, one toilet, a kitchen, a dining room and a living area, all chockablock with Ikea furniture. All areas are continuously lit by fluorescent lights, except the bedrooms, where the lights can be turned off but the people will still be visible. There is a small courtyard and garden, but they are surrounded by walls, affording residents a prisonlike view of nothing but a patch of sky.</p>
        <p>Every two weeks throughout the show's planned three-month run, one contestant will be thrown out. Each time, the residents  will nominate two people to remove, and members of the home audience, each spending 99 cents to vote by calling a 900 number, will make the final decision on which one will go.</p>
        <p>The house is a plain, prefabricated structure. It and the courtyard are encapsulated within an outer shell. Five cameras sit on dolly tracks in the space between the inner and outer walls. An operator can quickly and invisibly move a camera to catch some action through one-way mirrors found on every wall. In addition, 23 cameras and 60 microphones are visible, hung in every room and the yard. All are automatically controlled, and most can pan and zoom.</p>
        <p>While even the toilet and shower are under surveillance, the small cameras there are not for broadcasting. They are meant to ensure that participants do not retreat there to seek privacy, said the show's executive producer, Paul Romer. The bedroom cameras have night-vision capability, and footage from the bedrooms will be shown.</p>
        <p>While the cameras will monitor any nudity and sexual activity in the house, CBS says that such scenes will not be used for the television broadcast or the site's Web site.</p>
        <p>The aim of the producers is to make audience members feel like furtive watchers. ''We're purposely shooting and editing the show to look like a rough cut,'' said Mr. Romer, who is from the Netherlands and was one of the creators of the show there. ''The camera may zoom in too far or the focus may briefly be off, but that's O.K. We want the effect to be as if the viewer is actually watching the action through a window.''</p>
        <p>Literally every inch of the contestants' living quarters will be monitored. When the producers realized that a far corner of the courtyard was out of ideal camera range, they planted a cactus garden there to discourage anyone from loitering around it.</p>
        <p>The biggest hurdle Mr. Romer had to face was figuring out how to distill the previous day's videotape, documenting 10 individuals' lives, down to a 30-minute show for broadcast each night, and how to do that editing in just a few hours. Mr. Romer solved the problems during the show's 30-month gestation period in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Typical American sitcoms use three cameras, and the director, stationed in the control room, orders the action to switch between them. But in ''Big Brother,'' there are more than nine times as many video feeds.</p>
        <p>In the control room, designed in cooperation with Sony, the images captured by each of the 28 cameras are displayed on separate monitors, positioned in two rows of 14. Rather than continuously recording each camera feed and then later viewing all the video for possible inclusion in the half-hour show, the nine story editors make editing decisions on the fly. Only 4 of the 28 feeds are actually taped at any one time.</p>
        <p>Story editors, familiar with the goings-on at the house and presumably well aware of the various individual dramas forming and reshaping themselves, direct the most salient action to one of four larger monitors that sit atop the 28. Two of those monitors are used for the wide shot of each scene that might be worthy of inclusion, and the other two focus on close-ups of individuals.</p>
        <p>''When we first approached a Dutch technical company to help us do this, they thought we were nuts,'' Mr. Romer recalled. Referring to two other so-called reality television shows, he added: ''This is a much more difficult job than filming 'Survivor' or MTV's 'Real World.' On those shows, they tape everything and edit later. We're editing as the action unfolds and deciding instantaneously what to actually record.''</p>
        <p>Since the house is monitored around the clock, the crew members work in shifts. The story editors, all experienced in documentary production, watch the action unfold while listening to two audio streams through their headphones.</p>
        <p>When story editors spot action that they find interesting and germane on one of the four monitors, one of the control panel operators marks that spot electronically. Software designed by Sony records the time of day, the date and that sequence's time code, an electronic marker that allows the editor to find the shot quickly.</p>
        <p>Another assistant enters various keywords describing the scene into an Apple iBook. If the editors later want a particular shot but do not know where it is on the tape, they can search for it by typing a few descriptive words into the iBook, which will generate a list of shots that have been described by those keywords.</p>
        <p>To edit the show, all the marked sequences are digitized and transferred to  computer hard drives, then edited on Sony's digital editing system. The final cut is then transferred back to videotape for broadcast.</p>
        <p>Those viewers who wish to set aside their own lives to watch others live theirs can do that 24 hours a day on the Web site (www.bigbrother2000.com), which will continuously broadcast the same four channels that the control room is recording. AOL members (keyword: bigbrother) will also be able to see shots of the control room, the vegetable garden and the chicken coop.</p>
        <p>''The beginning is the hardest part,'' Mr. Romer said. ''We've got 10 people in a house who don't know each other, an inexperienced production staff and the need to be great right away. If we don't pull it off, the audience will quickly reject us.''</p>
