        <p>With Senor Coconut, the truth is stranger than the fiction, which is pretty strange itself. Released this week on the record label Emperor Norton, the second album by Senor Coconut, ''El Baile Alleman'' (Spanish for German Dance), masquerades as a collection of songs by the pioneering German electronic band Kraftwerk as performed by a Latin-music combo led by an eccentric South American composer, arranger and dancer known as Senor Coconut.</p>
        <p>The truth is that Senor Coconut is an alias for an innovative German producer who decided that engaging in the usual electronic dance-music tradition of obscuring his identity by releasing albums and singles using more than two dozen pseudonyms still wasn't affording him enough privacy.

        <p>With Senor Coconut, the truth is stranger than the fiction, which is pretty strange itself. Released this week on the record label Emperor Norton, the second album by Senor Coconut, ''El Baile Alleman'' (Spanish for German Dance), masquerades as a collection of songs by the pioneering German electronic band Kraftwerk as performed by a Latin-music combo led by an eccentric South American composer, arranger and dancer known as Senor Coconut.</p>
        <p>The truth is that Senor Coconut is an alias for an innovative German producer who decided that engaging in the usual electronic dance-music tradition of obscuring his identity by releasing albums and singles using more than two dozen pseudonyms still wasn't affording him enough privacy. Then, while in bed with the flu in 1996, he had a vision.</p>
        <p>Born Uwe Schmidt but best known for the music he has been releasing since 1990 under the names Atom Heart and Lassigue Bendthaus, he was trying to think of ways to blend Latin music with electronic dance when he suddenly awoke with the image of an album cover with the name Senor Coconut in his mind. He began working on the album in Frankfurt  but soon decided that he might as well move to Latin America, for both the new cultural experience and the additional cloak of privacy. So he told his friends he was moving to Chile. None of them believed him until he actually packed his bags and left for Santiago.</p>
        <p>''Living in Chile, I'm not getting too many phone calls from press and record labels and distributors,'' he said by telephone from his home there. ''It's a different life here. And being in a different culture changes your perception of things. Things are not as precise and tight as in Germany, for example, and because of it I'm making different music.''</p>
        <p>This is the beauty of Senor Coconut's ''Baile Alleman.'' Where his previous Coconut record, ''El Gran Baile,'' was a frenetic Latin-tinged take on drum and bass, this one uses an opposite approach. The rigidity and technological precision of the electronic dance music that Kraftwerk helped invent in the 70's has been removed, as if it were the spine from an animal, causing machine-deifying songs like ''The Robots'' and ''Trans-Europe Express'' to collapse into fun, loose cha-chas, merengues and cumbias.</p>
        <p>''You could listen to the album just as entertainment and nothing too profound,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''But at the same time there's the idea of a fake third world band covering first world avant-garde music. What does it mean? I always refer to it as a big absurd question mark.</p>
        <p>''If you know Latin music, you know that the people making it don't have any connection to the whole history of electronic music like in Europe. A Latin musician would never make a Kraftwerk cover: there's no compatibility. So a person in Europe like me had to move here to make an artificial connection with Latin music to do it. And it works musically, but at the same time it seems so bizarre: a German living in Chile programming Kraftwerk.''</p>
        <p>One of the most interesting juxtapositions on the album is his version of ''Autobahn.'' In the original, Kraftwerk took a Beach Boys-like refrain and mechanized and streamlined it for the automobile, droning, ''Fun, fun, fun on the autobahn.'' In Senor Coconut's laid-back cumbia version, the sand and sun return to the refrain, mixing now with the tire rubber and pavement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt said that when he sent out early demo versions of the album, an unmarked copy fell into the hands of Kraftwerk members, who thought at first that a Latin band was actually performing their music. When Kraftwerk learned the truth, its members, known for being extremely reclusive, critical of cover versions, and somewhat litigious, actually liked the music and struck up a dialogue with Mr. Schmidt. They had only one demand: that Senor Coconut's version of ''Radio-Activity'' be dropped from the album.</p>
        <p>''They thought my version was too happy for the content, which I didn't think was the case,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''Because a Latin band could only cover it that way. I told them that this means that a first world band would prohibit a third world band from covering its song because the versions are too light.</p>
        <p>''I tried to have a discussion to explain that it's a first world stereotype to think that Latin music is a joke and that nobody would think bad about Kraftwerk even if they do see the song in a funny way, but they insisted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt released two other recommended albums last year: one of more traditional cover songs, ''Pop Artificielle,'' under the name Lassigue Bendthaus and an electro-acoustic emulation of a jazz trio, ''Templates,'' under the name Flanger (a collaboration with Burnt Friedman). But for the rest of this year he is focusing on Senor Coconut, hoping to take it on the road if he can get financial support. As if the album itself wasn't already enough of a mishmash, he has a six-piece Danish band learning Latin dances to back the Venezuelan singer who learned German lyrics for the album.</p>
        <p>A Singing Dog</p>
        <p>For an even stranger forged musical identity, try ''Ananas,'' the third album by Dim-Dim, a Belgian cartoon dog. Created by Peter Pluut (who adapted the pseudonym Jerry Dimmer after fans showed up at his doorstep for autographs at 9 one morning), the album merges a homemade take on electronic dance music with a litany of sampled and sped-up voices, belonging, in Mr. Pluut's imaginary world, to singing vegetables, chickens, pineapples and frisky, spotted Dim-Dim himself.</p>
        <p>''I see the music somehow as little singles, like I had to compose my favorite hit parade,'' Mr. Pluut said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Once Mr. Pluut was a comic-book artist. But two years ago he stopped drawing, discovering that he could convey the same emotions and stories acoustically instead of visually. ''I wrote a lot of comics before, and I'm a big cartoon fan, so that turns out in the music,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Ananas'' (new on the Portland, Ore., record label Audio Dregs) comes off as warped dance music for children who find the Teletubbies  slow-moving. (Or think of it as an even more surreal version of the soundtrack to the Sony Playstation game Parappa the Rapper.) ''When I listen to a lot of electronic and computer music, most of it is so serious,'' Mr. Pluut said. ''Mine is not serious.''</p>
        <p>THE POP LIFE  Correction:  July 10, 2000, Monday  The Pop Life column on Thursday, about the new album by Senor Coconut on the Emperor Norton label, misspelled the title. It is ''El Baile Aleman,'' not Alleman.</p>
