        <p>THANKS go to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey for this week's lesson on the sorry state of being sorry in America.</p>
        <p>Your typical run-for-cover politician might have blushed after being caught on camera in an embarrassing pose while running around with the police. A photo from 1996 showed the white governor patting down a black man and flashing a delighted ''lookee, I'm tossing a perp'' grin. This after her state troopers had already frisked the man and found nothing.</p>
        <p>Blushing is not the Whitman style, though. Asked whether she would apologize to the man, she said, ''An apology would be too easy.''</p>
        <p>Easy for whom? One had to wonder. All too often, politicians and other public figures cling to the notion that prominence means never having to say you're sorry.</p>
        <p>As fate and sound-bite imperatives would have it, who do you think was on the spot huffing and puffing over Mrs. Whitman's frisky ways? None other than the Rev. Al Sharpton, himself a world-class non-apologizer. He has been urged many times to express regret for falsely accusing a former Dutchess County prosecutor of kidnapping and rape in the Tawana Brawley mess. Time and again, Mr. Sharpton's response has been, ''What, me sorry?''</p>
        <p>Then again, maybe it is just as well that the political types say nothing. When they do offer apologies, they tend to mummify them with phrases like, ''If I've offended anyone, then I'm sorry.'' That ''if'' tells you they are simply annoyed to be stuck in a bad spot.</p>
        <p>Add now another wrinkle that is turning up with some regularity. This is the apology that is earnestly offered, only to be unceremoniously rejected.</p>
        <p>John Rocker, the fatuous pitcher, came to town with the Atlanta Braves two weeks ago for the first time since the notorious magazine interview in which he insulted immigrants, gays and nearly everyone else in New York. He also came hat in hand. His remarks offended many people, he acknowledged, and ''for that, I sincerely apologize.''</p>
        <p>Let no one accuse the Mets' more self-righteous fans of responding to contrition with charity. They booed Mr. Rocker relentlessly at Shea Stadium, and threw back a baseball he had tossed into the stands as a peace offering.</p>
        <p>LAST week, City Councilwoman Annette M. Robinson of Brooklyn suffered a nasty bout of foot-in-mouth disease, saying that police officers looked like men who, had they been out of uniform, would have taken part in last month's sexual assaults in Central Park. She quickly apologized.</p>
        <p>Did Police Commissioner Howard Safir magnanimously say, ''Here's to you, Ms. Robinson''? Not a chance. ''If she is truly interested in apologizing,'' he sniffed, ''she should resign'' from a Council committee that studies police performance. Mr. Safir, mind you, is another champion non-apologizer, who finds it hard to say even ''oops'' when his officers smash down the wrong doors on drug raids.</p>
        <p>The apology rejections are piling up.</p>
        <p>Jane Fonda tried yet again last month to ask forgiveness -- make that beg forgiveness -- for her ''Hanoi Jane'' ways during the Vietnam War. Referring to a famous photo of her behind an antiaircraft gun aimed at American planes, she told O, the Oprah Winfrey magazine, ''It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done.'' Veterans' groups told her to take a hike.</p>
        <p>Some people said the same to The Hartford Courant after it apologized last week for having run slave advertisements two centuries ago. Herman Badillo, chairman of the City University of New York, had an apology thrown back in his face by students after he made off-kilter remarks last year about Mexicans and Dominicans. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has expressed contrition many times for his 1984 ''Hymietown'' crack. Still, many Jews won't forgive him.</p>
        <p>Certain people simply will not let go of others' stupid remarks, said Dr. Laura Lamontanaro, a clinical psychologist at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, N.Y. ''If you don't like someone to start with, and you hear a comment like that, it's enough for you to bury him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, vice chairman of the psychiatry department at N.Y.U. Medical Center, added that celebrities were often not given the same break most of us get in our dopier moments. ''We think we know John Rocker or Jane Fonda,'' he said, ''and we hold them to a standard that's quite unfair.''</p>
        <p>With Mrs. Whitman, one thing is sure. When it comes to apologies, she considers herself Mirandized. She seems to be saying that she has the right to remain silent.</p>
