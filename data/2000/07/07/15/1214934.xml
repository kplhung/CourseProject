        <p>Seeking to correct a mushrooming competitive imbalance because of payroll disparity, baseball's latest economic study committee presented a plan yesterday that would seem to take from the rich and give not to the poor but to the middle class.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, did not attend the owners meeting, where the 87-page report was presented, but it was primarily his money -- as well as Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday's and that of a few other owners -- that the four-man panel took aim at in one of the major elements of its plan.</p>

        <p>Seeking to correct a mushrooming competitive imbalance because of payroll disparity, baseball's latest economic study committee presented a plan yesterday that would seem to take from the rich and give not to the poor but to the middle class.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, did not attend the owners meeting, where the 87-page report was presented, but it was primarily his money -- as well as Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday's and that of a few other owners -- that the four-man panel took aim at in one of the major elements of its plan.</p>
        <p>Following an 18-month study, the panel members recommended that the owners share 40 to 50 percent of their local revenue, levy a 50 percent competitive-balance tax on portions of payrolls above $84 million, encourage clubs to have a minimum payroll of $40 million and withhold central-fund money from clubs that did not reach the minimum.</p>
        <p>As ways of enhancing the talent on weaker teams and keeping wealthy teams from gobbling up the best amateur players, the report also advocated a worldwide draft of amateur players, changes in the existing drafts of amateur and minor league players, allowing the trading of draft choices and elimination of compensation picks for lost free agents.</p>
        <p>The committee also said financially troubled clubs should be permitted to relocate more readily. No Major League Baseball team has moved since 1972.</p>
        <p>The four independent members of the panel were George J. Mitchell, the former Senate majority leader; Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Richard C. Levin, the president of Yale University; and the columnist George Will.</p>
        <p>Baseball, Will said at a news conference at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan, ''can get well by deciding to get well.''</p>
        <p>''Failure to act promptly will have grave consequences,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Some of the panel's recommendations are enhancements of practices already in place. In negotiations for the last collective bargaining agreement, for example, the clubs increased the amount of revenue they share, with money being transferred from the highest-revenue clubs to the lowest. But the panel cited the so-called local revenue as perhaps the biggest component of the disparity in the teams' economic status.</p>
        <p>The committee said that local revenue -- gate receipts, local television and radio contracts and stadium signage -- was really industry revenue and should be shared more liberally with all teams.</p>
        <p>In 1999, according to one of the many charts in the report, the Yankees received $175.94 million in local revenue. At the other end were the Montreal Expos, with $11.97 million.</p>
        <p>The panel would take 40 to 50 percent of each club's local revenue, put it into a pool and divide the pool evenly among the 30 teams. The existing plan has a two-tiered payout that benefits clubs below the industry's average local revenue. The panel's plan would remove that benefit from the poorer clubs and treat the middle-level teams the same as those below them economically.</p>
        <p>A baseball lawyer said at least some baseball officials have wanted to benefit middle-level clubs at the expense of the poorest clubs and at the same time take a huge chunk of money from the wealthiest teams.</p>
        <p>Although no panel member acknowledged knowing of any such desire -- Mitchell said the recommendations were exclusively the panel's -- Levin talked about the benefits the middle teams could gain from the revenue-sharing plan.</p>
        <p>Asked if he thought a bottom-tier team would sign a free agent passed up by a top-tier team because of the steep tax proposed, he said: ''Yeah, or a team in the middle. I actually think it will be a pronounced effect on midrange teams, second- and third-quartile payroll teams, because I think they will now see their playoff chances are going to be better if they invest in players. I think that's where you'll see more bidders in the market for the talented players.''</p>
        <p>And while most owners chose not to comment on a report they said they had not yet read, Drayton McLane of the midlevel Houston Astros said he was ''encouraged very much'' by the report.</p>
        <p>A person who attended the meeting said some representatives of low-level teams grumbled about the suggestion of a minimum payroll. But that grumbling does not figure to be any louder than the behind-the-scenes outrage certain to be expressed by Steinbrenner. A Yankees official said Steinbrenner would have no comment on the report, but the owner is certain to make his feelings known to Commissioner Bud Selig.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are expected to pay about $25 million in revenue sharing this year under the existing formula. That sum would escalate significantly under the proposed plan.</p>
        <p>Telephone efforts to reach Wilpon were unsuccessful, but the Mets would be hit hard, too. They were second in local revenue last year with $132.32 million.</p>
        <p>The proposed competitive-balance tax would also hit the Yankees. If the proposed 50 percent tax were in effect this year, the Yankees would have to pay about $16 million.</p>
        <p>The luxury tax that existed for the previous three years under the 1996 labor agreement used a 35 percent and 34 percent rate and a floating threshold determined by the average of the fifth and sixth highest payrolls. That tax, which is not in effect this year, ''failed to moderate the rapid escalation of club payrolls,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The report said that only the Yankees ($64.5 million), the Cleveland Indians ($45.92 million) and the Colorado Rockies ($12.44 million) were profitable operations over the past five years, 1995 through 1999. The San Francisco Giants, it said, were the biggest losers ($97.02 million).</p>
        <p>The panel was appointed by Selig and, unlike the last committee, had no members selected by the players' union. Asked about the report, Donald Fehr, the union head, said, ''We always get some report like this before a negotiation.''</p>
        <p>The union is expected next month to exercise an option in the current labor agreement to extend the contract until the end of the 2001 season.</p>
