        <p>The wooden bulkhead of a busy Conrail swing bridge over the Passaic River near Newark caught fire yesterday afternoon, creating dense columns of coal-black smoke visible throughout the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>The creosote-coated structure burned out of control from about 5:35 p.m. until shortly after 7 as firefighters from Newark and Kearny, N.J., working in blinding smoke, sprayed water down from tracks about 150 feet above the fire, said Deputy Chief Raymond Mulligan of the Kearny Fire Department.</p>
        <p>''It was arduous and fatiguing and difficult to access,'' Chief Mulligan said. ''We couldn't get down to the level of the fire, and we couldn't see in the thick smoke.''</p>
        <p>About 6:30, a 41-foot Coast Guard utility boat equipped with firefighting equipment reached the scene from its port on Staten Island and helped bring the flames under control, officials said.</p>
        <p>No injuries were reported.</p>
        <p>Robert Libkind, a Conrail spokesman, said last night that railroad inspectors would spend the weekend examining the bridge's steel superstructure for damage or weaknesses.</p>
        <p>The bulkhead, which is diamond-shaped, shields the mechanism that allows the bridge to swivel open for boat traffic, officials said.</p>
        <p>Each day, about two dozen freight trains from the west and south use the span, known locally as the Point-Nopoint Bridge. Mr. Libkind said those trains will be rerouted throughout the weekend onto other bridges that cross the Passaic.</p>
        <p>He said the cause of the fire was unknown.</p>
        <p>Conrail investigators will look into all operations on the bridge during the day and explore the possibility that trains or track work  might have generated sparks that fell into dry debris trapped in and near the bulkhead, Mr. Libkind said.</p>
        <p>Chief Mulligan said that in the past, sparks flying from the wheels of passing trains have started brush fires near the isolated stretch of warehouses and factories by the bridge.</p>
