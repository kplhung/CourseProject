        <p>It is a long process that will not be resolved for two and a half months, but Marion Jones took her first fleet steps on the long journey toward five gold medals tonight, cruising through the 100-meter preliminaries in 10.92 seconds at the United States Olympic track and field trials.</p>
        <p>Later tonight she qualified in her weakest event, finishing fifth in the preliminary round of the long jump with a leap of 21 feet 6 3/4 inches. Jackie Joyner-Kersee came out of retirement and also qualified for Sunday's final by jumping 21- 3/4, her first attempt in two years.</p>

        <p>It is a long process that will not be resolved for two and a half months, but Marion Jones took her first fleet steps on the long journey toward five gold medals tonight, cruising through the 100-meter preliminaries in 10.92 seconds at the United States Olympic track and field trials.</p>
        <p>Later tonight she qualified in her weakest event, finishing fifth in the preliminary round of the long jump with a leap of 21 feet 6 3/4 inches. Jackie Joyner-Kersee came out of retirement and also qualified for Sunday's final by jumping 21- 3/4, her first attempt in two years.</p>
        <p>''In the long jump, it's all about making the final,'' said Jones, who added about the 100: ''I think I can run faster than I ever have before.''</p>
        <p>The world's fastest man, Maurice Greene, ran this year's second-fastest time of 9.93 seconds in his 100-meter preliminary tonight. Michael Johnson ran the opening round of the 400 meters, winning his heat in 45.16 seconds as he seeks to repeat his Olympic double with gold medals at 200 meters and the quarter-mile. But the focus of this meet is on Jones and her attempt to do what no woman has ever done -- win five gold medals in track and field at the same Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking to win silver or bronze,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>And the more people tell Jones that she cannot win five golds at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, the more convinced she is that she can. She has been accomplishing the extraordinary all of her life: nine state high school championships in California, a collegiate basketball title at North Carolina as a freshman point guard, a pair of world championships at 100 meters, 36 consecutive victories running and jumping in 1998.</p>
        <p>''To me, going for five golds is continuing to achieve what doesn't seem reasonable to some or what people told her she couldn't do,'' said Ron Rapoport, who wrote Jones's biography, ''See How She Runs.'' ''This is one more. When people say, 'You can't do that,' she puts it to the farthest reach. I think it helps her with the events that she's been able to dominate.''</p>
        <p>Jones has not lost a foot race since the end of the 1997 season. And she is not likely to lose at 100 meters at the Olympic trials. Her personal best of 10.65 seconds is the fastest time run by any woman except Florence Griffith-Joyner, whose world record, 10.49 seconds, was allowed to stand at the 1988 Olympic trials despite the widespread belief that a strong tail wind was not properly recorded by a faulty wind gauge.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm ready to run my personal best at any time,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Is there anyone who can beat her at 100 meters? Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion at 200 meters and Jones's chief sprinting rival, struggled recently in the 100 in Europe, finishing fifth at a meet in Athens and sixth in Rome. Tonight she ran her seasonal best of 11.04 seconds, while the two-time Olympic champion Gail Devers ran a 10.99. Both will compete in Saturday's semifinals; the final is also Saturday.</p>
        <p>''That was just training,'' Miller said of her mediocre performances overseas. ''I was trying to see what I could do when I was tired.''</p>
        <p>Bolstered by her world 200 title in 21.77 seconds last year at the world championships in Seville, Spain, Miller has been saying that women's sprinting ''is no longer a one-woman show.'' Jones pulled up with back spasms at the event.</p>
        <p>The daughter of Lennox Miller, a two-time Olympic sprint medalist from Jamaica, Inger Miller has a beautifully fluid stride. This technical proficiency aids her significantly in maintaining her form through the grind of running rounds. But one of her training partners, Ato Boldon, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 and 200 meters, believes that she has become distracted by her fixation on beating Jones.</p>
        <p>''No one has shown me yet that they are ready to run with Marion in the latter half of the 100 meters,'' said Boldon, who trains with Miller under the sprint coach John Smith in Los Angeles and who is considered one of the more astute students of sprinting. ''I think Inger has to have more vision than, 'I just want to beat Marion here.' I think her focus should be on 'getting my act together, and qualifying, then dealing with Marion.' She'll face Marion a lot in Europe. That's when you work your magic.''</p>
        <p>Jones's form in the 100 suggests the rawness of power and speed more than the silky grace say, of Carl Lewis, but there is a tremendous resolve and control evident in the way she runs. Unlike most women, Johnson noted, Jones does not cross her chest with her arms as she sprints but is strong enough to keep them piston-pumping straight up and down in rhythm with her legs.</p>
        <p>Boldon said: ''Technically, she's not as good as she was in the past, but she's gotten stronger so it doesn't matter. People who know the sport do not use Marion as the textbook example of technique. You look at Marion as an athlete, her ability to compete, how she focuses.''</p>
        <p>Her form in the long jump is more troubling, and, some believe, more susceptible to injury. She has decided to let speed carry her to great distances, rather than to rely on any intricate technique. Her best jump this season is 22 feet 10 1/2 inches, fifth on the world list. But she is erratic and prone to fouls. Many experts, including Mike Powell, the men's world record-holder at 29-4 1/2, believe that Jones should be jumping 24 feet regularly and threatening 25 feet, which is four inches beyond the women's world record.</p>
        <p>''She may be jumping badly, then she can put a far jump out there if she does something right,'' Powell said. ''She can jump 23 feet by accident, she's so talented. But she shouldn't have to rely on accident.''</p>
