        <p>In the nine years since George Holliday, a Los Angeles plumber standing on the balcony of his Los Angeles apartment, videotaped the vicious police beating of Rodney G. King, tapes made by onlookers have become a potent legal and political tool.</p>
        <p>This week, with two more beatings by police officers videotaped by news helicopters in Philadelphia and in Lawrenceville, Ga., the images are as powerful as ever, once again inspiring protesters who say they are a uniquely vivid display of brutality.</p>
        <p>But videotapes of police beatings are actually not so rare, although few come to national attention. And a review of 18 recent cases involving such tapes shows that the police officers captured on film often face no criminal charges.</p>
        <p>That is no surprise, prosecutors, defense lawyers and other legal experts say, since bystander videotapes rarely present a complete picture of an incident, often capturing only the last few seconds of a violent chase or confrontation.</p>
        <p>Thus, facing videotapes in police brutality cases, defense lawyers generally argue, as they did successfully in the first prosecution growing out of the Rodney King beatings, that because the videotape caught only a piece of the interaction, it missed the context and the act of defiance that led to the beating.</p>
        <p>Additionally, hurried amateur tapes of violent attacks that last seconds rarely provide clear views of precisely who is doing what, making it hard even to tell which officer struck a particular blow. For example, in the Philadelphia case, a frame-by-frame analysis of the videotape by The Philadelphia Inquirer showed that the victim was punched and kicked 59 times in 28 seconds before a supervisor rushed in and backed the officers away.</p>
        <p>Tapes may come from a variety of sources. In a 1997 Pittsburgh case, the beating of a motorist, Evan Gross, was automatically recorded by a camera mounted on a patrol car. In a 1996 California case, television news helicopters followed a wild 70-mile chase and captured the 15-second beating of illegal immigrants piling out of a rusty pickup truck.</p>
        <p>''Tapes don't automatically lead to prosecution, because the legal standard is one of reasonableness,'' said Austin Sarat, a professor of law and political science at Amherst College. ''So what appears to us on the outside as absolutely reprehensible, might look to a prosecutor like bad behavior that, under the circumstances, would not convince a jury.''</p>
        <p>While Professor Sarat said the easy availability of video cameras was a positive development in helping to make cases against police officers who were brutal, he added, ''You can't just say, 'Oh, gee, these prosecutors should take these cases.' ''</p>
        <p>Still, almost every one of the incidents spurs local protests, and if, as is often but not always the case, the police officers are white and the victims black or Hispanic, the tapes rekindle deep racial tensions.</p>
        <p>In the most famous case growing out of a videotaped police beating, an all-white jury in Simi Valley, Calif., acquitted the four officers charged with beating Rodney King in March 1991. The verdict set off riots that took more than 50 lives.</p>
        <p>In 1993, two of the officers were convicted in a federal court of violating Mr. King's civil rights. And a year later, a Los Angeles jury awarded Mr. King $3.8 million in damages for his injuries.</p>
        <p>But many other cases never get to court:</p>
        <p>*In a 1994 case in Compton, Calif., a police officer who was sent to a trailer park to interview several siblings thought to be neglected smashed the oldest child in the face with his baton, hit him repeatedly after he fell to the ground, handcuffed the boy and used the baton to drag him to a police car, a sequence videotaped by the boy's godmother, a neighbor. The officer, Michael Jackson, said that what the tape missed was that he had been threatened and racially insulted by the boy, 17-year-old Felipe Soltero, and struck by a younger sister. The district attorney did not charge Officer Jackson with any crime. A civil jury awarded Mr. Soltero, who suffered a concussion but no broken bones, $1 in damages.</p>
        <p>*In a 1997 Baltimore case, in which a bystander recorded the fatal police shooting of James Quarles on a crowded August night at the Lexington Market, the prosecutor said there was no probable cause for manslaughter or murder charges. In the video, Mr. Quarles has his back to the camera as four police officers point handguns at him, so it is impossible to tell precisely what he is doing, but it is clear that he has a knife in his left hand.</p>
        <p>*In a 1998 case in Broward County, Fla., a grand jury would not indict a Fort Lauderdale police officer of any wrongdoing in what appeared to be the beating of a schizophrenic man, John Clements, videotaped by two Polish tourists. The grand jury was apparently unconvinced that it had enough information about what had happened off-camera. But Mr. Clements later settled his civil claims against the city for $210,000.</p>
        <p>*In a 1997 Pittsburgh case, state troopers were videotaped beating Evan Gross after a car chase. In the tape, Mr. Gross is seen getting out of the car with his hands up and being ordered to lie on the ground, where troopers swarm over him, punching and kneeing him. An Allegheny County grand jury, citing testimony from two police experts in the use of force, did not file excessive-force charges against any of the troopers. Mr. Gross's civil case is pending.</p>
        <p>In those and other cases, lawyers for the beating victims say, the videotape did not overcome a presumption in favor of the police, or the sense that what took place before the tape began rolling would provide a legitimate explanation for the violence.</p>
        <p>''Prosecutors and police officers work together all the time,'' said Stewart Greenberg, the lawyer for Mr. Clements in Fort Lauderdale. ''No one wants to believe a police officer would ever do anything wrong.''</p>
        <p>In the Clements case, Mr. Greenberg said, the tape did not stand up to the officer's lawyer's argument that without knowing what happened off-camera, it was unfair to charge his client.</p>
        <p>''The defense lawyer's argument is always going to be that the tape started at X moment, but missed the crucial moment that came earlier, at X minus 5,'' said Peter Kirchheimer, supervising attorney at the Federal Defenders Division of the Legal Aid Society.</p>
        <p>''Still, videotapes are a massive political fact,'' Mr. Kirchheimer added. ''Normally, the criminal justice system is pretty opaque, and people don't see what happened. Charges don't usually get brought against the police unless there's egregious injuries like the perforated rectum in the Louima case -- or a videotape. They're the thousand-pound elephant, and they change the whole balance.''</p>
        <p>As they make their way through the criminal justice system, the newest cases may face the same problems as their predecessors.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Philadelphia television stations repeatedly played the tapes of a group of police officers beating and kicking a man accused of stealing a police car and shooting at officers in a milelong chase. The suspect, Thomas Jones, was treated for five bullet wounds.</p>
        <p>Unlike the King case, in which the police were white and the victim black, the Philadelphia case involved both black and white officers. While the tapes vividly show a group of police officers beating Mr. Jones, a six-foot, 240-pound ex-convict, they do not show how the incident began. The police say Mr. Jones, who was first stopped for driving a stolen car, fled on foot, then grabbed an officer's gun, began shooting and jumped into a nearby patrol car to flee.</p>
        <p>''The tapes show that the guy was subdued, and thereafter assaulted,'' said Chet Mirsky, a professor of criminal law at New York University. ''You see the guy down on the ground, being gratuitously kicked, on a continual basis, by more than one police officer.</p>
        <p>''But in thinking about what's excessive force,'' Professor Mirsky said, ''you have to remember that this is a dangerous person, that anyone in their right mind would have reason to fear. My guess is that it probably won't get prosecuted, unless there's just enormous public hue and cry.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, in Lawrenceville, Ga., a news helicopter taped police officers punching and kicking a drunken driving suspect, Marshall Dwight Studdard, as he lay on the ground after a 20-minute chase. But because Mr. Studdard is obscured by an officer on the tape, it is difficult, in that tape, too, to determine what he was doing during the beating.</p>
        <p>Of course, it is not just in prosecuting police beatings that videotapes are becoming a factor. Banks and convenience stores have long taped their transactions to deter crime.</p>
        <p>And as video cameras are more widely used, tapes of public events are becoming almost ubiquitous, whether at the Justice Department's removal of Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives' home, or the recent sexual violence in Central Park after the National Puerto Rican Day Parade.</p>
        <p>''Amateur videotapes are everywhere,'' said Paul Chevigny, a professor at New York University Law School. ''Look at what happened in Central Park; they came up with something like 27 videotapes. It's true people are more likely to have cameras at a parade, but it's also a measure of how much videotaping is out there now.''</p>
