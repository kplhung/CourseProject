        <p>A continuing strike at the Museum of Modern Art has removed another event from its summer calendar. First Run Features, a New York film distribution company, has announced that it is postponing an eight-week retrospective that was to have run from July 27 to Sept. 12. Among the 40 to 50 films scheduled were documentaries, gay and lesbian and foreign films and new releases.</p>
        <p>''We feel very strongly about not crossing a union line especially because of the history of our company,'' said Kelly Hargraves, director of publicity for First Run Features. ''The company was started as a company that distributed documentaries and films that deal with social issues, like 'Harlan County USA.' We were very torn because it was a great honor to be at the Museum of Modern Art,'' she said, ''but in the end decided that this was a principle that we believe in very strongly.''</p>
