        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas met privately this morning with Gov. George E. Pataki of New York to talk about the vice presidency, and Republican officials with ties to Mr. Pataki's office said that the hourlong discussion coincided with other signs that Mr. Pataki is being looked at for a spot on the Republican ticket.</p>
        <p>None of these officials claimed that Mr. Pataki had emerged as the front-runner in a selection process that has been shrouded in the utmost secrecy, and others expressed skepticism that Mr. Bush would choose him.</p>
        <p>But several Republicans said that aides to Mr. Pataki had spent much of the last week reviewing his record and his past to assist with the kind of intensive background check that prospective vice presidential candidates typically undergo.</p>
        <p>They also said that Mr. Pataki's breakfast meeting with Mr. Bush, in a hotel suite in Newark, where Mr. Bush was campaigning, came after Mr. Pataki had received one of the questionnaires that the Bush campaign distributed to possible running mates and after the New York governor had spoken on the telephone several weeks ago with Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary, who is supervising the selection process for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Later today, after both Mr. Bush and Mr. Pataki had addressed the New York Conservative Party in Manhattan, they ate lunch together in a hotel suite there, Republican officials said. These officials said they did not know if the second meeting was private, or if it concerned the vice presidency.</p>
        <p>''There's definitely been a kick-up of activity there,'' said one Republican official, referring to communications between the Bush campaign and Mr. Pataki's office.</p>
        <p>But other prominent Republican officials, some of them close to Mr. Pataki, said that his chances would be hurt by his support for abortion rights and his recently aggressive advocacy for gun control. Those positions are not only at odds with the Texas governor's but also inevitable points of contention with conservatives in the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>They also said there was no evidence that Mr. Pataki could help Mr. Bush carry New York State, which is considered nearly a sure winner for Vice President Al Gore. They said that Mr. Bush's meeting with Mr. Pataki this morning, which the Bush campaign made no effort to hide, could simply have been a gesture intended to flatter Mr. Pataki and to project the image that Mr. Bush was open-minded about sharing the ticket with a more moderate Republican.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that it was done as theater,'' said one Republican official who is close to Mr. Pataki. ''Nobody in Austin is talking about Pataki. And they're not going to take the risk of picking a pro-choice governor and having the convention become all about abortion.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, confirmed that Mr. Bush and Mr. Pataki talked about the vice presidency this morning, but did not provide details. Until now, Mr. Pataki's name had been mostly absent from Republican officials' speculation. Other names that have been mentioned frequently include Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, Senators Fred Thompson and Bill Frist of Tennessee, Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, Elizabeth Dole and, more recently, Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also campaigned frequently and spoken privately with Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, a close friend. But many Republican officials and political analysts say that Mr. Ridge and Mr. Pataki will ultimately be passed over because of their support for abortion rights.</p>
        <p>But a Republican official with close ties to Mr. Pataki's office said that the party was so solidly behind Mr. Bush that he might be able to afford the choice of Mr. Ridge or Mr. Pataki, and that Mr. Pataki was the less controversial of the two. Unlike Mr. Ridge, the official noted, Mr. Pataki had not been drawn into bitter disputes with the Catholic leaders in his state.</p>
        <p>Zenia Mucha, a senior adviser to Mr. Pataki, said today that ''the governor has not and will not talk about any private conversations he may or may not have had with Governor Bush.'' And Mr. Bush and Mr. Pataki, in their remarks to the Conservative Party, simply made clear that they shared a friendship and a mutual respect.</p>
        <p>''I think the world of George Pataki,'' said Mr. Bush, who attended Yale University at the same time as Mr. Pataki and became governor of Texas the same year that Mr. Pataki became governor of New York. ''He's a really good man.''</p>
        <p>''In fact,'' Mr. Bush added, ''the second best thing that happened in 1994, in November of 1994, was watching the New York returns come in.''</p>
