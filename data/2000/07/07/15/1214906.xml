        <p>William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, rattled his fellow Republicans this week by offering a plan to add prescription drugs to Medicare that resembles proposals by Congressional Democrats and the White House. The Roth plan repudiates the ill-conceived Republican bill that passed the House and provides a plausible platform for a bipartisan agreement -- though probably not before the elections.</p>

Mr. Roth's bill goes far beyond offering a drug benefit, however, embracing a reform for the entire Medicare program that mirrors proposals by President Clinton, a majority of the bipartisan Congressional committee on Medicare reform and a wide swath of health experts.</p>

        <p>William Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, rattled his fellow Republicans this week by offering a plan to add prescription drugs to Medicare that resembles proposals by Congressional Democrats and the White House. The Roth plan repudiates the ill-conceived Republican bill that passed the House and provides a plausible platform for a bipartisan agreement -- though probably not before the elections.</p>
        <p>Under the House bill, only private insurers would offer coverage to the elderly. But even some private insurers regard the bill as unworkable.  Mr. Roth concedes as much by proposing instead a plan that would have the government, as well as private plans, offer drug coverage. Mr. Roth's bill goes far beyond offering a drug benefit, however, embracing a reform for the entire Medicare program that mirrors proposals by President Clinton, a majority of the bipartisan Congressional committee on Medicare reform and a wide swath of health experts.</p>
        <p>The absence of a drug benefit is only one of Medicare's problems. In the last few weeks,  for example, many private managed-care plans have dropped out of the program in some regions, leaving enrollees to scramble for new coverage. The reason, they say, is that government reimbursement for covering the elderly is too low for them to survive. The simple truth is that under the current rules the government cannot possibly know how much it needs to pay plans to keep them active participants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth proposes major revisions. The government would continue to offer existing Medicare coverage as well as offer a second option that would be expanded to include coverage of drugs. Managed-care plans would be invited as well to offer the same two options. For each enrollee, the government would pay the managed-care plans an amount approximately equal to the cost per person of its fee-for-service coverage. Managed-care plans that could offer the same benefits for less cost would be allowed to offer their customers rebates.</p>
        <p>The idea is to harness market-driven competition to force plans to provide innovative care and hold down costs. Like the Clinton plan, the Roth formulation would not need to raise premiums in the government-run fee-for-service plan faster than planned under current law except to cover the cost of additional drug coverage.</p>
        <p>There are flaws in the Roth plan, but they are remediable. Enrollees in the government plan who decide to buy the new drug coverage would pay more for home health care and some other benefits. That threatens to fragment the insurance market, driving people into or out of drug coverage based on their expected needs for home health care and other benefits. Also, the drug policy that Mr. Roth appears to have in mind would be far less generous than what Democrats have proposed and the elderly need. But to correct these and the other flaws requires only the commitment to spend more money. No structural redesign is needed.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats attribute Mr. Roth's decision to side with them to his need to firm up support for his re-election bid in Delaware. Perhaps. But whatever the motive, Mr. Roth has offered an attractive plan for giving reliable, affordable drug coverage to the elderly as part of a vastly improved overall Medicare program.</p>
