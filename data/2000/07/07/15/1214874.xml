        <p>Hard rock got turned inside out in the 1990's. Its insularity broke down as hip-hop and hard-core elements moved in; its blues roots receded further. It dismantled melody to keep its distance from the power ballads on MTV; it also moved toward extremes of speed or sloth. Its tone changed, too, so that hard rock was no longer a guaranteed blast of power or a foretaste of apocalypse. With the ascent of grunge and Nine Inch Nails, hard rock made room for self-doubt and private turmoil alongside the old rage.</p>
        <p>The Deftones, who played to a packed and moshing Roseland Ballroom on Wednesday night, encompass the whole contradictory spectrum of new hard rock. They can be brutal or sullen, repellent or disgusted, uncertain or furious. Chino Moreno sings about dark impulses, festering decadence and shattered hopes in a world of random violence and constant tension. He's victim, perpetrator, protector or accuser in songs where vulnerability can suddenly switch to lashing out.</p>

        <p>Hard rock got turned inside out in the 1990's. Its insularity broke down as hip-hop and hard-core elements moved in; its blues roots receded further. It dismantled melody to keep its distance from the power ballads on MTV; it also moved toward extremes of speed or sloth. Its tone changed, too, so that hard rock was no longer a guaranteed blast of power or a foretaste of apocalypse. With the ascent of grunge and Nine Inch Nails, hard rock made room for self-doubt and private turmoil alongside the old rage.</p>
        <p>The Deftones, who played to a packed and moshing Roseland Ballroom on Wednesday night, encompass the whole contradictory spectrum of new hard rock. They can be brutal or sullen, repellent or disgusted, uncertain or furious. Chino Moreno sings about dark impulses, festering decadence and shattered hopes in a world of random violence and constant tension. He's victim, perpetrator, protector or accuser in songs where vulnerability can suddenly switch to lashing out.</p>
        <p>The music whipsaws from haunted-house ambient sounds to pummeling hard core to grinding, dissonant chords. Song structures are fractured and arbitrary, held together by stubborn force of will and sheer muscle.</p>
        <p>Often Mr. Moreno sustains a melody above Stephen Carpenter's gnashing guitars and Abe Cunningham's walloping drums; it's a style traceable to Tool, whose leader, Maynard James Keenan, collaborated with the Deftones on a song for the group's new album, ''White Pony'' (Maverick/Warner Brothers). But the crooning can switch at any moment to ranting or howling, and even when he's singing a tune, Mr. Moreno sounds like someone at the breaking point.</p>
        <p>It's not inviting music; noise and cryptic lyrics keep outsiders at a distance. But with three albums and constant touring over the last five years, the Deftones have built a following large enough to send ''White Pony'' into the Top 10. Plenty of fans can identify with the Deftones' view of the world as an endless purgatory. ''Keep it all inside until we feel we can't unleash,'' Mr. Moreno rapped in ''Seven Words.''</p>
        <p>At Roseland, Mr. Moreno wandered the stage like a man beset by private demons. With stark white spotlights stretching his shadow, he turned his back to the crowd; he climbed on top of amplifiers and crouched there, swaying back and forth; he came to the edge of the stage and grabbed every upraised hand; he leaped into the crowd, which caught him and held him upright. But there was none of the standard self-congratulation of bygone hard-rock front men. Mr. Moreno was neither hero nor romantic antihero, just human flotsam.</p>
        <p>The set began with ''Be Quiet and Drive'' -- with Mr. Moreno shrieking, ''Drive me far away/I don't care where, just far'' -- and made its way through panoramas of desolation. There were tales of abduction, murder, bloody marital strife and thwarted hopes.</p>
        <p>In new songs like ''Change'' and ''Digital Bath,'' the Deftones have allowed themselves a little more melody than in the past, opening their cult following a little wider. But onstage, the band assaulted the songs with rending feedback and blasts of distortion. The last thing the Deftones want is to provide the template for the 21st-century power ballad.</p>
