        <p>Oscar Garcia Cleves, 47, of Cali became only the second person to be extradited from his native country to face charges in the United States since Colombia amended its constitution in 1997.

        <p>A Colombian man who United States law enforcement agencies say is one of the top three leaders of a Colombian drug cartel appeared in Federal District Court here today after he was moved under heavy guard from a prison in the South American country and flown to the United States.</p>
        <p>Oscar Garcia Cleves, 47, of Cali became only the second person to be extradited from his native country to face charges in the United States since Colombia amended its constitution in 1997. The change in the constitution restored extradition of its citizens as part of Colombia's legal arsenal against drug lords after extradition was outlawed in 1991. Before the latest two extraditions, the last was in 1990.</p>
        <p>The White House's drug policy director, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, applauded the development as a breakthrough and a sign that the November extradition of Jaime Orlando Lara was just the beginning of a wave of such actions.</p>
        <p>No one in the drug policy office today would say exactly how many Colombians might eventually be extradited. But last fall, government officials estimated that as few as 10 to as many as 42 might be sent to the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia-Cleves was arrested in Colombia on United States warrants in February 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia-Cleves, who went by the name Sergio, is charged in a four-count federal indictment with conspiring to ship more than 445 kilograms of cocaine from Colombia to Port Newark in 1998.</p>
        <p>Seven other people involved in the transactions in the United States have been arrested by federal Customs Service and Drug Enforcement Administration agents and have pleaded guilty to various charges, said Robert J. Cleary, the United States attorney for New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia-Cleves is one of three top-ranking members of ''a very active cartel called Cartel de los Niches or 'our little niche,' '' said one Customs Service investigator. It came into existence in the early 1990's, he said, as one of the successors to the Medellin and Cali cartels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garcia-Cleves fought his extradition through the Colombian court system for more than 15 months. According to Colombian press reports, 200 soldiers escorted him from a prison there to the plane that flew him, first to Miami, and then to Newark on Thursday.</p>
