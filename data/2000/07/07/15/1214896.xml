        <p>Air Line Pilots Union and Federal Aviation Administration end dispute over pilots' safety objections to FAA's effort to broaden use of procedure under which controllers clear a plane to land using only part of a runway because another plane will be landing or taking off on another runway that crosses the first one; under a compromise, controllers can order two airliners or two private planes to use procedure, but they cannot order a private plane and an airliner to land on intersecting runways; pilots have sometimes refused to use procedure, and airlines say their refusal has added substantially to delays at airports in Chicago and Boston (M)</p>

        <p>After the worst month of delays in air traffic history, airline pilots and the Federal Aviation Administration today ended a safety dispute that led pilots to sometimes refuse a specific kind of land instruction. The airlines said the refusal by pilots to use the procedure added substantially to delays at airports in Chicago and Boston.</p>
        <p>The dispute involved a procedure called ''land and hold short operations,'' under which controllers clear a plane to land using only part of a runway, because another plane will be landing or taking off on another runway that crosses the first one. The procedure had been in use since 1968, but in April the F.A.A. announced it would broaden use of the procedure, and some pilots unions said the changes raised the chance that planes would collide.</p>

        <p>After the worst month of delays in air traffic history, airline pilots and the Federal Aviation Administration today ended a safety dispute that led pilots to sometimes refuse a specific kind of land instruction. The airlines said the refusal by pilots to use the procedure added substantially to delays at airports in Chicago and Boston.</p>
        <p>The dispute involved a procedure called ''land and hold short operations,'' under which controllers clear a plane to land using only part of a runway, because another plane will be landing or taking off on another runway that crosses the first one. The procedure had been in use since 1968, but in April the F.A.A. announced it would broaden use of the procedure, and some pilots unions said the changes raised the chance that planes would collide.</p>
        <p>According to the Air Transport Association, the trade association of the big carriers, the refusal by pilots to land under the procedure was responsible for 25 percent of the delays in Boston and 10 percent at O'Hare, in Chicago. Miami and Honolulu were also affected by the action.</p>
        <p>The pilots unions often raise safety concerns to the F.A.A., but in this case, some unions took the unusual step of recommending to their members that they use ''discretion'' in deciding whether to accept clearances to land under the procedure. Many of them began refusing such clearances, adding to delays at busy airports with runways that intersect.</p>
        <p>At the F.A.A., Ronald E. Morgan, the director of Air Traffic, said, ''where demand is high, it's going to decrease delays.''</p>
        <p>At United Airlines, which uses O'Hare as a hub and which in June recorded an on-time performance of less than 57 percent, Peter D. McDonald, the vice president of operational services, said, ''not using it had a significant effect on our operations.''</p>
        <p>The procedure is used only when there is little wind, when the runways are dry and when visibility is good. Mr. McDonald said, ''It's a good-weather procedure, but since we can't use it even on good days, it is like bad weather all the time.''</p>
        <p>But the union raised a variety of safety questions. One was whether the pilots of private planes, or pilots for foreign airlines, could be trusted to understand instructions to stop in the middle of the runway, without proof that they had been trained.</p>
        <p>''If I'm landing full length on the runway, I need some assurance that another pilot who has been told to land and hold short of my runway knows how to do that,'' said Capt. Paul D. McCarthy, executive air safety chairman of the Air Line Pilots Union, the largest union. ''How do we verify and document that the other pilot has the requisite level of training, and how can a controller tell the difference?'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, under a compromise, controllers can order two airliners to land on intersecting runways, or two private planes; they cannot order a private plane and an airliner to land on intersecting runways.</p>
        <p>In another compromise, the union and the government have agreed that controllers will stop using the procedure on a handful of intersecting runways that the union believes have not yet been adequately analyzed for the risk of collision if one of the planes, as sometimes happens, fails to land but circles instead. So far no incidents have been reported as a result of the procedure's use.</p>
        <p>Pilots are always in charge of their aircraft, and whether to accept a clearance from air traffic control, for landing or takeoff, is always up to them. Captain McCarthy said his union would be advising its members that any clearance now offered by controllers would be in accordance with the union's criteria, and that he, too, was glad if the result was to allow more landings and takeoffs.</p>
        <p>''We're job-dependent, and capacity means jobs to pilots,'' he said. But, he added, ''my job is not to increase capacity; My job is to operate the airplane from Point A to Point B, in the safest possible manner.''</p>
        <p>Negotiators for some other unions also agreed to the compromise. Some airlines, however, have never accepted the clearances for the procedure and will not do so now; for example, Southwest Airlines flies mostly to smaller airports, and has not trained its pilots to use the procedure. Controllers are not supposed to offer the clearances to Southwest planes, and if they do, pilots are supposed to decline them.</p>
        <p>In the first 28 days of June the airlines reported 44,000 delays, up from 38,000 in the same period a year earlier. Weather was the biggest cause, and Mr. McCarthy noted that the F.A.A. does not keep track of how many landings and take-offs are performed using the procedure.</p>
