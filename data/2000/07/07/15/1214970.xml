        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Tough Justice: Taking a Child When One Parent Is Battered'' (front page, July 8):</p>
        <p>Our justice and child welfare systems should do much more to protect both a mother and her children from an abuser and to hold the batterer accountable for harming them.</p>
        <p>These mothers' efforts to protect their children can be heroic, although not always discernible to caseworkers. Once her children are removed, a battered mother must go to great lengths to prove that she is a good enough parent to get them back. But their male abusers are routinely awarded visitation with the children they have traumatized.</p>
        <p>We should support victims and ensure that they and their children remain safely together and require  abusers to prove that they pose no further risk to either child or mother before permitting access to any member of the family.</p>
        <p>JULIE A. DOMONKOS  White Plains, July 12, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is executive director, My Sisters' Place, a domestic violence services and advocacy organization.</p>
