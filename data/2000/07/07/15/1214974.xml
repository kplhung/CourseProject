        <p>In a ruling that reassured anti-discrimination groups concerned that a recent Supreme Court decision would weaken New Jersey's hate crimes law, a state Superior Court judge today imposed a strict sentence on a man who had pleaded guilty to an anti-Semitic rock-throwing spree in a heavily Jewish section of the city.</p>
        <p>This was the first bias crime case to reach a state court since the Supreme Court last month limited judges' sentencing discretion in such cases.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Michael Melchione, was given four years in prison, with no chance of parole until two years had been served.</p>
        <p>The sentence, according to prosecutors, hinged on an admission by  Mr. Melchione, 35, of Kenilworth, of anti-Semitic bias in the October 1999 incident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melchione had thrown large rocks at several businesses in Elizabeth's Elmora section whose signs indicated that they were owned by or principally served Jews, and had assaulted a Jewish woman.</p>
        <p>Alan Silver, an assistant Union County prosecutor, said that without the element of religious bias, Mr. Melchione would have faced 180 days in a county jail or possibly probation.</p>
        <p>In a statement in court, Mr. Melchione attributed his outburst to his being a paranoid-schizophrenic, rather than to neo-Nazi sympathies.</p>
        <p>Last month the United States Supreme Court struck down provisions of the state's Ethnic Intimidation Act, or hate crimes law, that allowed a judge to increase a sentence in cases in which he or she found any sort of bias as an aggravating circumstance.</p>
        <p>In their ruling, the justices found that a jury must determine such bias before a judge could increase penalties. Some groups, including the Anti-Defamation League of New Jersey, had feared that this would hamper use of the state's hate crimes law.</p>
        <p>Judge Ross R. Anzaldi noted in sentencing Mr. Melchione today that his admitted psychiatric problem and failure to take medication kept the case from being a ''clear-cut case of the actions of a bigot.''  Nevertheless, he said that the guilty plea to the charges acknowledged bias, and Mr. Melchione therefore could be given a stiffer sentence.</p>
        <p>Charles Goldstein, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said that there was some concern by the group and other organizations concerned with bias crimes that the Supreme Court ruling had seriously weakened the state's law.</p>
        <p>''But this decision demonstrates unequivocally that those who commit bias crimes will go to jail,'' Mr. Goldstein said outside the courtroom here.</p>
        <p>Joseph Spagnoli, Mr. Melchione's lawyer, said that he had advised his client to accept the plea agreement, admitting to the stiffer bias charge and facing a potentially longer sentence, rather than go through a trial  in which he would have had to present the ravages of his illness as a defense to a hate crime charge.</p>
