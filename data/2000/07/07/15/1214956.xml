        <p>PETE SAMPRAS and the Williams sisters have come to Wimbledon and are now gone. Tiger Woods is not yet in St. Andrews for the British Open. So tonight, Britain presumably belongs to the heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Or does it?</p>
        <p>''Business or pleasure?'' the man at Heathrow's passport counter asked.</p>
        <p>''Business,'' the American visitor replied. ''I'm here to cover the fight Saturday night.''</p>
        <p>''What fight?'' the passport man asked.</p>
        <p>''The Lennox Lewis fight,'' he was told.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know,'' the passport man said.</p>
        <p>In the taxi into Londontown, the driver had to be reminded that Lewis was defending the World Boxing Council and the International Boxing Federation titles against Frans Botha of South Africa in the new London Arena next to the glassy office buildings of the Docklands area.</p>
        <p>''For another multimillion pounds,'' he snorted.</p>
        <p>''Isn't Lewis a hero here?'' the American said.</p>
        <p>''In the boxing world he's known,'' the driver said, ''but it's not like you have a pinup of him in your front room.''</p>
        <p>Or any other room.</p>
        <p>Although the fight is billed as ''The Homecoming'' for Lewis, he is not accepted here as a homeboy, even though he is the first British-born heavyweight champion since Bob Fitzsimmons lost the title to James J. Jeffries in 1899 and he parties here when he is not in training. He also had most of his early pro fights in England.</p>
        <p>But his parents are Jamaican and he grew up in Kitchener, Ontario. He won the 1988 Olympic heavyweight gold medal for Canada with a second-round knockout of Riddick Bowe at Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>He seldom trains here anymore, but you would think that he would have trained here this time, if only to help promote his first fight in London since his second-round knockout by Oliver McCall at Wembley in 1994 -- the only stain on his 36-1-1 record with 28 knockouts.</p>
        <p>Instead, Lewis trained, as he often has, at Caesars Brookdale resort in Scotrun, Pa., in the Poconos.</p>
        <p>''He should have mingled with the people, then the fight would have been sold out the first night,'' Botha said, alluding to the expected assembly of only 10,000 in the 12,000-seat arena. ''If I was from London, I would have been training right here so I could have all the fans around me. It was a big mistake.''</p>
        <p>In the cable television era, boxers don't have to sell tickets to the arena. Their money is usually guaranteed. Lewis will collect an estimated $5.5 million and Botha $1.5 million for tonight's delayed HBO telecast.</p>
        <p>The referee, incidentally, will be the respected Larry O'Connell, the judge who scored Lewis's debatable draw with Evander Holyfield at Madison Square Garden early last year as just that: a 12-round draw.</p>
        <p>Boxing is different here. Thursday's outdoor weigh-in at Covent Garden should have been a promoter's dream. Attract the lunch-hour crowd to the charming old market area that is now mostly cafes and boutiques. See the boxers step on the scale in front of St. Paul's Church, which opened in 1633 and was later a theater. Stir interest. Sell tickets.</p>
        <p>But the London bobbies ordered the promoter Panos Eliades not to publicize the site or the time of the weigh-in. The bobbies didn't want the Covent Garden area more crowded than it usually is at lunchtime. The bobbies got their wish. As Lewis weighed 250 pounds and Botha 236, what turned out to be a nonevent was crowded but not overcrowded.</p>
        <p>As for the fight itself, Lewis is a 14-to-1 favorite in the legal betting shops over Botha, whose only losses in his 40-2-1 record were knockouts by Mike Tyson and Michael Moorer.</p>
        <p>''You've got to put a lot of pressure on Botha,'' said Lewis's trainer, Emanuel Steward. ''He'll be a real cutie-pie if you let him. He'll turn, twist, grab you. If you give him room, it can be a very awkward fight. You've got to stay busy. He's very durable, too. Lennox can't sit around and wait. He can't fight a technical fight. He's got to stay busy.''</p>
        <p>Botha's new trainer, Abel Sanchez, has the bulky South African in better shape, with more strength and more stamina.</p>
        <p>''Remember that Frans punches harder than Oliver McCall did,'' Sanchez said. ''He could knock out Lewis in the first or the 12th.''</p>
        <p>And everybody in London remembers how their homecoming hero was knocked out by McCall six years ago. Or do they?</p>
