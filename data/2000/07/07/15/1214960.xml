        <p>It was the perfect end to a day of swimming, relay races and folk singing at summer day camp in the Rockland County woods: a Hawaiian luau of hamburgers, pineapple slices and inflatable palm trees.</p>
        <p>And that was just the beginning. The campers were looking forward to campfires and s'mores for the one night that they were to spend without their moms, dads, brothers and sisters, or teddy bears too big to squeeze into knapsacks.</p>
        <p>So the 140 children, ages 7 to 10, piled into five buses with their sleeping bags -- and rode into Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the camp experience in the age of the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>For the first time in at least a decade when the skies were clear, the 92nd Street Y camp's fabled overnight event under the stars would take place indoors in Manhattan instead of at the Henry Kaufmann campground in Pearl River, N.Y. Instead of a campfire, there would be a circle of flashlights. The s'mores would be made with Marshmallow Fluff.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Y said that out of concern for the safety of the children and parents' fears about the West Nile virus, they did not want campers exposed to mosquitoes during the active feeding hours at night.</p>
        <p>At a time when danger lurks in the form of disease-bearing pests and litigious parents, camp operators are becoming more cautious.</p>
        <p>''When we're dealing with the outdoors, we're dealing with ticks and we're dealing with mosquitoes and we're dealing with bats,'' said Peg Smith, the executive director of the American Camping Association, based in Indianapolis. ''I think everybody's more conscious today. Clearly everybody is living in that world that tends to be concerned about lawsuits. But what we're most concerned about is the safety of children going to camp.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith said she did not know of any other camps in the country that had eliminated overnight camping. The fears over West Nile are a local phenomenon, and so far this year, no one in the New York region is known to have become infected.</p>
        <p>For the children at Camp Yomi, the only day camp sponsored by the 92nd Street Y that features an overnight campout in Rockland County, safety meant sleeping indoors in the Y building on Lexington Avenue on Thursday night.</p>
        <p>The campers found themselves sitting atop hardwood floors in a dance studio, smearing Marshmallow Fluff on graham crackers. When it was time for the nighttime story, they assembled into a rough circle around a campfire fashioned from small blue flashlights.</p>
        <p>And at night, they padded down the hall to the bathroom and back to the classrooms where the carpeting was covered by a wall-to-wall patchwork of sleeping bags. After a few tears were wiped away and several campers had phoned home for a reassuring goodnight, post-lights-out giggles reverberated from plaster walls instead of disappearing into the stars and shadows.</p>
        <p>Hours beforehand, with the sun still high and the mosquitoes at rest, Marissa Katz, 10, was reluctant to head out of the woods. ''I live in the city, and it's just all the stars you see'' at the camp, she said. The Yomi camp-out last year ''was much more fun.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of people brought junk food,'' she said wistfully. ''It was just that we liked the stories they told and everything -- it was just a blast.''</p>
        <p>An avid watcher of New York 1, Marissa had her own solution to the mosquito problem. ''I'm trying my best to catch them and kill them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>When it came to the West Nile virus, the Camp Yomi kids' awareness spanned from blissfully in the dark to surprisingly plugged in. Some are anxious, others fearless.</p>
        <p>Molly Gilbert, 8, did not claim to be fearless, nor did she reserve her antipathy for the carriers of the ''Western disease,'' as she called it. ''I'm scared of all bugs,'' she announced, twisting a red-and-purple lanyard.</p>
        <p>''I'm not scared at all,'' said David Halimi, 9, who lives in Paris with his parents and was visiting his grandparents in New York for the summer. David, whose tan baseball cap somehow resembled a canvas beret, said that if he saw a mosquito, he would ''kill him with my foot.'' At that, he lifted a socked-and-sandled one and stomped the dirt.</p>
        <p>Meagan Stromer, 8, said she loved Camp Yomi, even though she cried a little when she got a nosebleed playing soccer. Meagan said she discussed the mosquito problem with her parents, who might not have let her sleep out in the woods. ''I'm glad we're not having it here,'' she said. ''I'm a little scared when I go to sleep, because when everyone's asleep, and it's pitch black.''</p>
        <p>Alan Saltz, the director of the 92nd Street Y's many camp programs, said he wanted the campers to have the experience of dealing with their fears in the woods. He recalled his own childhood summers sleeping on tarps beneath the open sky at the same Henry Kaufmann campground, no questions asked. ''There's a whole trend in parenting that I've seen in my 10 years here, that I'd call micro-managing,'' he said, adding, ''It's hard to imagine my folks getting worried about these kinds of things. I just think the world has changed.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Saltz ultimately decided to err on the side of caution after consulting with the Rockland County health department. Six of the 10 crows infected by the West Nile virus in New York State this year were discovered in the county. He said the fear of lawsuits did not figure into his decision.</p>
        <p>Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health, said the 92nd Street Y's move was a ''prudent precaution.''</p>
        <p>''We're not telling any overnight camps that they shouldn't be in business,'' Ms. Smith said. ''We're telling them what the risks are and what the personal prevention measures are that could be taken.''</p>
        <p>One parent said she was glad Mr. Saltz took the initiative. Juggling the responsibilities, concerns and errands of child-rearing, she said she had forgotten even to worry about West Nile.</p>
        <p>''I'm feeling bad that I really haven't thought about it,'' said the parent, Diana Rodriguez, who arrived at the Y to drop off the roller blades that her son, Joshua Flores, 9, had left behind. Joshua, who had his first sleepover at last year's campout and had been looking forward to this year's, informed his mother of the change in plans before she had a chance to read a note sent to parents. The two were shopping for bug spray and flashlights at Modell's Sporting Goods when Joshua piped up, ''Mom, we don't need that.''</p>
