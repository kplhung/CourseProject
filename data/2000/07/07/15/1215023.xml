        <p>SULLIVAN-Thomas. On Tuesday, July 4th, 2000 the Irish Tall Ship ASGARD II paused during the Millennium Tall ships parade to honor the life of Thomas F. Sullivan. Immediately, upon passing the Aircraft Carrier John F. Kennedy, with President Bill Clinton in attendance, the ASGARD II paused in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty for a eulogy &amp; moment of silent prayer in the memory of Mr. Sullivan. Captain Tom McCarthy saluted Mr. Sullivan as an example of the contribution that Irish Americans have made to the growth of America. Captain McCarthy, with all hands assembled, spoke of Mr. Sullivan's career on the New York waterfront with the John W. McGrath and Universal Stevedoring firms. Upon completion of the ceremony, ashes of Mr. Sullivan who passed on March 31, 2000 were spread on the waters of New York Harbor. The ASGARD II then proceeded back to its honored Parade Position and fired its cannon repeatedly, passing many of the piers where Mr. Sullivan had worked. Tom would have been 84 today. God Bless</p>
