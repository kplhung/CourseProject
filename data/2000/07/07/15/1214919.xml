        <p>Yvonne Christensen approaches her job like a stand-up comedian. ''You've got about 15 seconds to grab 'em,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Walter Fletcher sees it as similar to being a relief pitcher: when you walk onto the mound, players are already on base.</p>
        <p>And Cindy Manzo sounds as if she's joined the circus. ''I'll stand on a chair, I'll dance around, I'll pretend my shoe is a phone,'' Mrs. Manzo said of her 15 years as a substitute teacher in three states. ''Anything to keep their attention.''</p>
        <p>These three longtime substitutes were among 50 who exchanged horror stories and survival strategies here at the first-ever national conference of substitute teachers today, part of a scattershot effort to raise pay, benefits and working conditions for what is perhaps education's least respected profession.</p>
        <p>The nascent effort, organized by far-flung substitutes who met over the Internet, comes at a time of the most severe shortage of substitute teachers in memory. With student enrollment and teacher absenteeism growing, class size shrinking and the unemployment rate near record lows, school districts across the country are scrambling to fill gaps at the front of the classroom.</p>
        <p>Many districts have raised wages, but others have lowered requirements: in half the states, all it takes to be a substitute teacher is a high school diploma.</p>
        <p>Substitutes have long been disrespected by students, teachers and administrators alike and largely ignored by researchers and politicians. But students, on average, spend a full year of their school lives in classes taught by substitutes, a fact that has fueled a small but growing movement to improve training for these guest workers and take their role more seriously.</p>
        <p>''It's like driving a car; it's skill-based,'' said Geoffrey G. Smith, executive director of the Substitute Teaching Institute at Utah State University, which has made a CD-ROM that provides a self-taught seminar for potential recruits. ''There are skills that one can learn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said that fewer than 10 percent of school districts provided training for substitutes, but those that did had found it decreased the number of complaints and attracted more applicants.</p>
        <p>Expert estimates of the number of substitutes range from 500,000 to 1 million, but nearly everyone agrees there are not enough. In a recent survey by Mr. Smith's institute, 86 percent of school districts reported a substitute shortage, with more than half calling it a ''serious problem.''</p>
        <p>Pay varies widely, from $30 to $185 a day, with an average of about $65. Qualifications also range: Some districts require a full-fledged teaching credential, others simply do a criminal background check.</p>
        <p>For decades, the ranks of substitutes were filled with teachers unable to find full-time work, retirees and parents helping out in their children's schools. But now, as the nation faces a teacher shortage of some 2.5 million in the next decade, substitute rosters are threadbare, and districts are turning to flight attendants, firefighters, college students and others.</p>
        <p>The full-employment economy, where potential substitute teachers might make better money flipping burgers, is not helping. Nor is the rise in the number of professional development days that pull full-time teachers out of class. Assistant principals and even superintendents are having to fill in in emergencies, and some districts ask cafeteria workers and bus drivers to serve as subs. Last November, the Kelly Services temporary agency began providing substitute teachers nationwide.</p>
        <p>In the Atlanta suburbs of DeKalb County, full-time high school teachers can earn an extra $15 for teaching during their planning periods. When Georgia passed a law slashing the number of teachers' aides statewide, the district also decided to turn 600 aides into substitutes this fall rather than fire them.</p>
        <p>''The obvious thing to do is to pay more money,'' said Franklin D. Grant, director of the office of human resources at the 97,000-student DeKalb district, and president of the American Association of School Personnel Administrators. ''How do you get a commitment out of anybody for $30 or $40 a day?''</p>
        <p>The shortage has provided fertile ground for organizing efforts. The National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers each represents substitute teachers in a handful of cities and towns; substitutes have also affiliated with other labor groups, including Service Employees International Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers.</p>
        <p>In Oregon, legislators recently passed the eighth in a series of bills focused on substitute teachers, setting pay scales at 85 percent of a district's average teacher salary. In Michigan, the state teachers' association has adopted a substitute's ''bill of rights'' calling for health benefits, a safe environment and ''the dignity and respect that, as professional educators, they have earned.''</p>
        <p>The keynote speaker at today's conference was Shirley Kirsten, founder of the Fresno Area Substitute Teachers Association in California. The group began with five people having coffee in her living room in 1997 and ended up negotiating a contract last year on behalf of hundreds of substitutes that raised substitute salaries to $80 or $90 a day, from $65, depending on the assignment.</p>
        <p>''We have been isolated for too long,'' Ms. Kirsten told attendees, who had come from Nebraska, Florida, New York, Oregon, North Carolina and Virginia. ''We now need to get together under one umbrella. That umbrella is respect.''</p>
        <p>Most of those attending the conference were longtime substitutes with teaching credentials, many of them having chosen the flexibility of daily assignments over the responsibilities of a full-time classroom.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Manzo, who is 52, said substituting fit with her military husband's mobility (they have relocated 18 times) and enables her to care more easily for her son and her father, both of whom have medical conditions requiring her attention.</p>
        <p>But substituting can mean teaching French and physics and fourth grade -- all in one week. Adaptability is essential.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fletcher, who organizes substitutes in Los Angeles, keeps boxes of teaching material in his car, in case someone forgets to leave a lesson plan. He does not know sign language, except the sign for ''interpret,'' so he can direct someone to translate if he is teaching a class of deaf and hearing-impaired students.</p>
        <p>Then there was the time he was teaching band, and all the instruments were locked up. He passed out paper and pencils he had brought, and taught the students to write musical notes.</p>
        <p>Pamela Routh, a substitute in San Francisco for 25 years, revealed a secret for controlling a rowdy classroom of children she's never met. ''You say, 'Kevin, sit down,' '' Ms. Routh confided. ''There's always a Kevin, so the students think you know everybody's name.''</p>
