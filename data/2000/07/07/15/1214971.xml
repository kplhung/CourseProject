        <p>Ellie S Wertheim letter, commenting on July 8 article, says that when battered women seek intervention and assistance from the police or social service agencies that in turn remove their children, they are deterred from pursuing safe and healthy alternatives for their families</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a founder of the ''failure to protect'' pilot project in Bronx Family Court who now represents battered women, I read ''Tough Justice: Taking a Child When One Parent Is Battered'' (front page, July 8) with interest. When women in crisis seek intervention and assistance from the police or social service agencies that in turn remove their children, they are deterred from pursuing safe and healthy alternatives for their families.</p>
        <p>Assessing risk to children and families is subjective. But separating children from their non-offending parent is traumatic and does little to solve the pervasive problems of family violence.</p>

        <p>The success of the Bronx project underscores the questionable practice of removing children from victims of domestic violence. The project's emphasis on preserving the mother-child unit in domestic violence cases should be the standard practice.</p>
