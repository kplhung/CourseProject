        <p>Borough officials in Manville, N.J., will hire a project manager to oversee the purchase of dozens of houses damaged last year by Tropical Storm Floyd. They acted this month after the state agreed to provide $1.6 million in matching aid necessary to qualify for $5 million in federal buyout money for the borough.</p>
        <p>The federal grant is part of a nationwide effort to avoid paying repeatedly for damages in flood-prone areas by buying out homeowners. In this case, the Manville houses, in the Lost Valley section, will be bought at pre-flood market values. The homes will be razed and the lots turned into parkland.</p>

        <p>Borough officials in Manville, N.J., will hire a project manager to oversee the purchase of dozens of houses damaged last year by Tropical Storm Floyd. They acted this month after the state agreed to provide $1.6 million in matching aid necessary to qualify for $5 million in federal buyout money for the borough.</p>
        <p>The federal grant is part of a nationwide effort to avoid paying repeatedly for damages in flood-prone areas by buying out homeowners. In this case, the Manville houses, in the Lost Valley section, will be bought at pre-flood market values. The homes will be razed and the lots turned into parkland.</p>
        <p>Gary Garwacke, the Manville administrator, said about 250 Lost Valley houses sustained some flood damage during the storm in September 1999, but federal officials determined several months ago that only 42 houses were eligible for the program. Participation is voluntary, and Mr. Garwacke said about 10 of the 42 homeowners either had decided not to sell or had sold their homes to other people and moved out of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Manville, a borough in Somerset County about 25 miles southwest of Newark, is still recovering from storm-related flooding, and it received notice this week that it was being sued by 14 Lost Valley families whose houses were damaged. They contend that borough officials did not give them proper warning about the flood. In the lawsuit, which was filed in State Superior Court in Somerset County, the residents say that a town siren warning system had been in disrepair for two years and did not go off as it should have.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garwacke said that because of the lawsuit, he could not comment on how much warning the town should have given residents.</p>
