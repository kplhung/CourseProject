        <p>Reacting to the news that a participant in its new reality series ''Big Brother'' is a follower of the former Nation of Islam official Khalid Abdul Muhammad, CBS said yesterday that it was ''looking into'' the report but at the moment saw no reason to remove the man from the program.</p>
        <p>In a statement, CBS said that ''we and the producers of 'Big Brother' will not tolerate nor permit any hate speech on the program.'' But the statement emphasized that ''there has been no hate speech on Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>The statement came after The Daily News reported yesterday that William Collins, one of 10 participants in ''Big Brother'', is a follower of Mr. Muhammad, who now leads a group called the New Black Panther Party. Mr. Muhammad was ousted from the Nation of Islam for his denigration of Jews, whom he once called ''bloodsuckers.'' He has also denounced whites and has called Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani a devil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad organized the Million Youth March in 1998 in Harlem, which ended in a violent confrontation with the police. Mr. Collins, who also uses the name Hiram Ashantee, attended that rally. The News reported that he was at Mr. Muhammad's side at a news conference during the rally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins, under the name Ashantee, was quoted in The Philadelphia Inquirer after the march, criticizing the police; he made no anti-Semitic statements. As Hiram Ashantee he is well known in Philadelphia as an organizer for Mr. Khalid and an activist with black youth groups. In a biography included in CBS promotional material, Mr. Collins is called a ''youth group leader.''</p>
        <p>The ''Big Brother'' show puts 10 strangers in a specially constructed house for three months where their every movement is on camera. Every other week one house member is voted out by viewers after being nominated for banishment by the  other housemates. Mr. Collins was one of two house members nominated for ouster on Thursday. The members who chose him cited the tension and dissension he was causing.</p>
        <p>In the first two weeks of shows, Mr. Collins has been outspoken about his racial views, but he has not engaged in anything that would have been described as hate speech.</p>
        <p>Still, some executives involved in the production of ''Big Brother'' expressed concern that Mr. Collins had not been entirely forthcoming about his background. For example, when asked if he ever went by any other names he reportedly said only that he sometimes used the nickname ''Hiram.''</p>
        <p>Executives involved in the show said that the production company, Endemol, a Dutch television company, and CBS, which is part of Viacom Inc., had conducted a background search on William Collins, not Hiram Ashantee. The search included credit reports, and a full legal report. Nothing was found to exclude Mr. Collins.</p>
        <p>CBS began another search yesterday and said it still found nothing that would warrant excluding Mr. Collins from the show.</p>
        <p>A CBS spokesman said that as of last evening the network had received no calls of protest about Mr. Collins from any Jewish organizations.</p>
