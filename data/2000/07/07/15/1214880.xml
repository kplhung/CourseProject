        <p>Re Anthony Lewis's July 8 column: Public Citizen is not financed by the textile executive Roger Milliken, contrary to a suggestion by The New Republic cited by Mr. Lewis.  Indeed, the author of The New Republic's article wrote in the May 1 issue that ''I never reported that Roger Milliken finances Public Citizen -- only that close allies of the group suspected that he did.''</p>

        <p>Re Anthony Lewis's July 8 column: Public Citizen is not financed by the textile executive Roger Milliken, contrary to a suggestion by The New Republic cited by Mr. Lewis.  Indeed, the author of The New Republic's article wrote in the May 1 issue that ''I never reported that Roger Milliken finances Public Citizen -- only that close allies of the group suspected that he did.''</p>
        <p>The fact is, we take no money from government, businesses or trade associations. We are financed mostly by very small donations from 150,000 members, sale of our publications and foundation grants.</p>
        <p>The trade-at-any-cost advocates cannot understand that Public Citizen does not need any financial buyoff to assume its leadership role in advocating changes in the anti-consumer, anti-democratic rules of the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
