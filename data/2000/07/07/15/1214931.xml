        <p>Three human skulls and a small cache of chemicals and gunpowder were discovered in a cluttered Brooklyn apartment early yesterday, initially stirring fears that the police had stumbled upon the gruesome lair of a serial killer.</p>
        <p>But the authorities later determined that the skulls were 70 to 80 years old, the gunpowder was left over from the Fourth of July and the chemicals were simple fertilizer.</p>
        <p>''We are not treating these as homicides; this is not some sort of Jeffrey Dahmer,'' a police official said.</p>
        <p>The skulls and chemicals were found inside a single-room apartment in Bushwick after the man who lived there was arrested on charges that he stood in the street and fired a .22-caliber pistol into the air after arguing with another man about 6 p.m. Thursday, the police said.</p>
        <p>Police officers approached the man, who ran into his apartment at 20 Wilson Avenue, the police said. The officers arrested Claudio Toral, 23, inside, where a skull was in plain view, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police obtained a search warrant and found two other skulls in the early hours yesterday. One was in a small gray suitcase, and the other two were in a cardboard box, the police said.</p>
        <p>A friend and neighbor of Mr. Toral said that the young man had the skulls because he was a fan of heavy metal music. ''Just because he bought a couple of skulls, that doesn't make him a nut,'' said the friend, Nestor DeJesus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toral was charged with weapons possession and menacing in the firing of the pistol, the police said.</p>
