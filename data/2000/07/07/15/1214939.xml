        <p>A Jury in Florida Awards $144.8 Billion to Smokers  A jury in Florida ordered the tobacco industry to pay $144.8 billion in punitive damages to 500,000 smokers in the largest damage award in United States history.</p>
        <p>But even as some of the sick smokers and the widows and widowers of others celebrated the verdict as a victory over the industry, tobacco executives called the award ridiculous, and one that would push the companies into bankruptcy if it is paid. They vowed to appeal the verdict, which could take years. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Senate Repeals Federal Estate Tax  The Senate voted to repeal the federal estate tax, brushing aside a veto threat from President Clinton and giving Republicans a symbolic victory on an issue at the top of their election-year agenda. The vote was 59 to 39. Although Democrats have long said repeal of the tax would be a hugely expensive giveaway to the rich, 9 of 45 Democrats voted for the legislation. Four Republicans voted against. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Nasdaq's Highest Close in 3 Months  The Nasdaq market finished with its highest close in three months as strong earnings and a tame inflation report bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates again this year. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 71.32 points, or 1.7 percent, to 4,246.18. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,812.75. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.14 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,509.98. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Consumer Spending Stays Strong  The nation's shoppers kept spending through the spring despite an increase in interest rates and gasoline prices, according to government reports. Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent last month, to $269.3 billion. The Labor Department's report on prices paid to producers, which excludes both services and imported goods, showed a 0.6 percent advance for finished goods. [C4.]</p>
        <p>New Presence in the Boss's Office  A federal agency's ruling this week that non-union workers summoned into a boss's office can bring along a fellow employee as a witness has won derision from managers and praise from labor activists. But both sides say the decision is unlikely to alter the dynamics of the workplace anytime soon. [C2.]</p>
        <p>CBS Checks Past of a Cast Member  CBS said it was ''looking into'' a report that one of the participants in its new reality series, ''Big Brother,'' was an associate of the militant anti-Semitic black leader Khalid Muhammad, but the network said it saw no reason to remove the man from the program. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Impresario Settles Suit With KPMG  The Broadway impresario Garth Drabinsky, a Canadian citizen wanted on criminal charges in the United States related to the collapse of his Livent production company, said he had settled his suit against his former accountants KPMG and KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. KPMG acknowledged that it had breached its fiduciary duty by allowing KPMG Investigation and Security to conduct an inquiry into Livent's financial affairs. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Japan Recovery Said to Be on Track  Japan's Finance Minister said the failure of the giant retail chain Sogo would not undercut the country's economic recovery and Standard &amp; Poor's called the Sogo bankruptcy necessary medicine for the Japanese banking system. A bailout of Sogo collapsed after Shinsei Bank, a big Sogo creditor that was recently purchased by foreign investors, balked at forgiving any Sogo debts. [C2.]</p>
        <p>PepsiCo Has 21% Gain in Earnings  PepsiCo reported a 21 percent rise in second-quarter earnings this week, soundly beating estimates. The performance was driven by double-digit gains at its salty snacks and juice businesses. [C14.]</p>
