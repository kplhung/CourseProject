        <p>Two years after a jury found him and two other prominent black leaders liable for defamation in the racially divisive Tawana Brawley case, Alton H. Maddox Jr. has vaulted back into the spotlight by vowing to reverse the verdict and refusing to pay ''one red penny'' of the damage award.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maddox filed papers in Dutchess County Court on Thursday faulting the Federal Bureau of Investigation's analysis of the evidence that helped to exonerate Steven A. Pagones, a white former assistant district attorney whom Mr. Maddox and the others had accused of raping Ms. Brawley, a black teenager, in 1987. And yesterday, lawyers for the Rev. Al Sharpton and C. Vernon Mason, Mr. Maddox's co-defendants in the defamation case, said they would join Mr. Maddox's petition.</p>
        <p>On that unexpected note, the fiery Mr. Maddox, who also convened a raucous news conference Thursday on the courthouse steps to press his case, promised to revive a protracted drama that once bitterly divided New Yorkers along racial lines but had recently seemed to have been put to rest.</p>
        <p>Just two weeks ago, a state appellate court dismissed an appeal filed soon after the verdict by Mr. Maddox, Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Mason. A few months ago, Mr. Sharpton and Mr. Mason quietly began to pay part of their salaries to Mr. Pagones, for a combined total of roughly $2,000. And most of the principals, it seemed, had moved on to other pursuits.</p>
        <p>But in this case, it sometimes takes only the smallest trigger -- a legal maneuver here, a speech there -- to unleash the passions that still persist, with supporters of Ms. Brawley convinced that Mr. Pagones unfairly escaped punishment and with Mr. Pagones still bitter and determined to clear his name for good.</p>
        <p>''I'm at a point now where nothing surprises me,'' Mr. Pagones said yesterday. ''I'm not surprised by what Maddox did. Desperate people do desperate things.''</p>
        <p>In November 1987, Ms. Brawley, 15, was found inside a plastic bag behind an apartment house in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. She was curled in a fetal position, with feces and racial epithets splattered on her body. Mr. Pagones was accused by Mr. Sharpton, Mr. Mason and Mr. Maddox -- civil rights advocates who rallied to Ms. Brawley's side as advisers -- of abducting and raping the girl.</p>
        <p>The next year, a grand jury exonerated Mr. Pagones, suggesting that Ms. Brawley had concocted a hoax to avoid punishment by her stepfather for being out without permission. The grand jury also implied that Ms. Brawley's advisers had allowed the case to mushroom into a national cause despite indications that her account was dubious.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pagones filed a $395 million defamation suit in October 1988 against Ms. Brawley and the three advisers. Ms. Brawley never responded; in 1991, a judge ruled that Mr. Pagones had won his case against her by default. Then, in 1998, after an eight-month trial, a jury found that Mr. Pagones had indeed been defamed, and awarded him  $345,000 in damages: $185,000 from Mr. Mason, $95,000 from Mr. Maddox and $65,000 from Mr. Sharpton.</p>
        <p>Since then, most of the principals, with the exception of Mr. Sharpton, have maintained a low profile while awaiting the outcome of the often-glacial appellate process. Mr. Pagones is vice president and general counsel of Peter Vito &amp; Associates, a private investigation firm in Beacon, N.Y. Mr. Mason, a disbarred lawyer, is a minister and a director of a youth program at the New York Theological Seminary in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brawley was reported to be in Washington a few months ago, working at the Howard University Medical Center, but has since eluded process servers and Mr. Pagones's lawyers, who are trying to collect the $185,000 in damages she was ordered to pay. Mr. Maddox, a suspended lawyer, had also eluded process servers who tried to deliver subpoenas to his home or office in New York City, said Garry M. Bolnick, a lawyer for Mr. Pagones.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago, the case inched closer to an apparent conclusion when a panel of the State Supreme Court's Appellate Division ruled unanimously to dismiss the appeals filed by Mr. Pagones's foes.</p>
        <p>So on Thursday, Mr. Maddox returned to the public eye by filing legal papers and holding a news conference cum rally on the Dutchess County courthouse steps, encircled by about 50 supporters.</p>
        <p>''The F.B.I. agents who came to testify against Tawana Brawley were serial liars,'' said Mr. Maddox, adding that if Mr. Pagones believed that ''I'm going to pay him one red penny, he's crazy.''</p>
        <p>In particular, Mr. Maddox said  there might have been inconsistencies in the analysis of the evidence conducted by Michael Malone, an F.B.I. agent and expert on hair and fiber analysis. After all, Mr. Maddox argued in court papers, Mr. Malone had been investigated by the Justice Department for allegedly giving false testimony at trials in the 80's.</p>
        <p>An F.B.I. spokesman told The Poughkeepsie Journal this week that Mr. Malone had been cleared of any wrongdoing. Still, Mr. Mason's lawyer, Stephen C. Jackson, said yesterday that he planned to file an affidavit next week challenging Mr. Malone's credibility. And Mr. Sharpton's lawyer, Michael A. Hardy, said  his client had already filed an affidavit echoing those sentiments.</p>
        <p>''Reverend Sharpton's position has been and continues to be that he stands by his belief in Tawana Brawley,'' Mr. Hardy said.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the outcome of Mr. Maddox's latest legal maneuver, Thursday's events did not go perfectly for him. As he demonstrated, he was finally served with a subpoena demanding that he return to Poughkeepsie in August to divulge his financial assets to Mr. Pagones.</p>
