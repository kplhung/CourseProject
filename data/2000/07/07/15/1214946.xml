        <p>Five months after the European Union imposed sanctions on Austria to protest the inclusion of members of a far-right party in the Austrian government, machinery giving everyone a face-saving way to end the diplomatic freeze is in place.</p>
        <p>A panel of experts has been named to study Austria's human rights record and the political nature of Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party. After that, the sanctions are to be reviewed, and if the panel finds that Austria does not violate civil rights, the sanctions will presumably be lifted.</p>
        <p>Austria, which had harshly criticized the European Union for meddling in the affairs of its democratically elected government, said it wanted the sanctions off by October, when all 15 leaders of the union will hold a summit meeting in France. But France, the leader in imposing the freeze on Austria, has refused to promise anything.</p>
        <p>But there are signs of a thaw. At Bastille Day celebrations today, the Austrian ambassador was among the dignitaries who shared the reviewing stand with President Jacques Chirac of France, a far cry from the twists and turns that have been developed to keep Mr. Chirac out of range of Austrian officials in recent months.</p>
        <p>Experts said there were enormous pressures at work that were highly likely to make the sanctions disappear fairly quickly.</p>
        <p>For one thing, France has just taken over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union, and both its prestige and, perhaps, the timely expansion of the union are riding on its being able to deliver on a difficult agenda. With more than 12 countries on the runway to join it, the European Union has to overhaul its institutions or face paralysis.</p>
        <p>Now, most decisions require unanimous votes. That is hard enough with 15 members. Experts say it would be virtually impossible to achieve much with more members. But what sort of voting system would be acceptable?</p>
        <p>With an issue like that, experts said, the tension created by continuing sanctions could be a disaster. This month, Austrian officials threatened to use their veto to block any sort of progress. This week, they seemed to back down, perhaps judging how unpopular such a stand would make them. But experts said a failure to resolve the problem could be costly.</p>
        <p>''If I was French, I would be worried,'' said Charles Grant, a political expert with the Center for European Reform in London. ''These issues are always brokered as a package. You don't want one country that is not really trying to make it work.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, while the sanctions remain unanimously in force, with 14 members refusing to meet Austrian officials at anything more than a ''technical level,'' many European Union countries have grown tired of the penalties, indicating that they would like to see the situation resolved.</p>
        <p>Belgium, France and the Netherlands are generally considered to be the holdouts who call for the continued sanctions. In some smaller ''Euroskeptic'' countries, the freeze has been seen as an example of how big countries go after small ones for their own interests.</p>
        <p>Much is made of the fact that Italy has had far-right politicians in its government with no action taken against it.</p>
        <p>Many point out that Mr. Chirac's enthusiastic denunciations of Austria's Freedom Party played well at home, where he is already trying to position himself for the 2002 presidential race.</p>
        <p>That argument is having a particular effect in Denmark, which is considering whether to adopt the euro as its currency. A referendum on the issue is to be held in the fall.</p>
        <p>''This boycott could cost the vote in Denmark,'' Mr. Grant said. ''The truth is that this freeze was entered into on the spur of the moment and nobody thought about the consequences.''</p>
        <p>These ripple effects are also putting pressure on France to stand down.</p>
        <p>This week certainly seemed to show a softening all around. First, Mr. Chirac invited the Austrian ambassador to the Bastille Day celebrations. Then, the Belgians announced that they too would extend a similar courtesy and invite the Austrian ambassador to their national day celebrations, on July 21.</p>
        <p>For his part, Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel of Austria seemed to be toning down his comments this week. Some experts suggested that he had the air of a man who had won the battle. Visiting Brussels on Wednesday, Mr. Schussel assured everyone that his country would do nothing to sabotage the European Union preparations to expand. ''Words such as 'threats,' 'blackmail' and 'veto' should be deleted from the vocabulary,'' Mr. Schussel said.</p>
        <p>He embraced the choice of three ''wise men'' to examine Austria's human rights record -- former President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland; Prof. Jochen A. Frowein, director of a Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany; and Marcelino Oreja, a former Spanish government minister and past member of the European Commission -- and said they would have little problem reviewing Austrian ''commitment to common European values.''</p>
        <p>Still, some experts warned that Austria was not out of the doghouse yet and could jeopardize lifting the sanctions if it was not careful. ''It is clear that everyone is getting ready for the 'climb down,' '' said Peter Ludlow, founding director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''But I'm still somewhat skeptical of their ability to get there. The body language is still not good. The Austrians had better not crow too soon or too loudly.''</p>
        <p>Despite his withdrawal of any threat to disrupt the expansion talks, Mr. Schussel did not call off a referendum to ask voters how they feel about the sanctions. The vote is planned for the fall if the sanctions have not been lifted by then.</p>
        <p>Other members have criticized the idea, fearing that the Freedom Party will use the campaign to whip up feeling against the European Union.</p>
        <p>Even the president of the union's executive body, Romano Prodi, who has been largely silent on the sanctions, criticized them this week, saying they should end ''as soon as possible.''</p>
        <p>Commission officials said Mr. Prodi was willing to speak out because it was clear that the sanctions had failed to achieve their purpose and were fueling sentiment against the union in several countries.</p>
        <p>''I don't think in general terms,'' Mr. Prodi said, ''that sanctions give better results than those achieved in serious, vigorous, in-depth dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 22, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article last Saturday about moves by the European Union to lift sanctions on Austria referred incorrectly to the body's decision-making process. While decisions on key issues including sovereignty, taxation, foreign policy and financing for regional development require unanimous votes, most others do not.</p>
