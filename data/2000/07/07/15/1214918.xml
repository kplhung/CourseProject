        <p>A federal agency's ruling this week that a nonunion worker summoned into a boss's office can take along a fellow employee as a witness is being derided by management lawyers and praised by labor advocates. But both sides say the decision is unlikely to alter the dynamics of the workplace immediately.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, any union member called into a disciplinary meeting has had the right to be accompanied by a co-worker. On Monday, the National Labor Relations Board extended that right to all workers, union or not. And the initial reaction from management ranks was dismay.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden, where the rights were limited to 10 percent of the work force, now they're 100 percent of the work force,'' said Randel K. Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''That's 90 percent more. So, we're concerned about it, but we're still sorting through the practical implications.''</p>
        <p>Some employment lawyers say the ruling represents a new hidden tripwire for managers as they conduct the routine business of running offices and factories: disciplining employees, handing out performance evaluations, sorting out misunderstandings and, of course, firing people. Supervisors generally prefer to handle such matters privately; but under the new ruling, any employee who anticipates trouble is entitled to take along a co-worker of his choice as a witness.</p>
        <p>''It would be very unworkable if every time you wanted to talk to one of your employees, you had to get somebody to come into the room and get involved in the conversation,'' said Thomas Walsh, a partner at the law firm of Jackson Lewis.</p>
        <p>There are also concerns that the ruling could hamper employers as they try to investigate embezzlement, sexual harassment and other wrongdoing at work.</p>
        <p>''One of the hallmarks of a good investigation is whether the company is able to keep it confidential,'' said Paul Salvatore, a partner at the law firm of Proskauer Rose, which represents managers in employment disputes. If the witness ''spreads the word that they're investigating everybody in the department for theft, that compromises the employer's investigation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For a decade, management lawyers have been counseling employers to investigate sexual harassment assertions privately, to avoid compounding such matters with accusations of managerial insensitivity. Now, the lawyers are wondering how their clients will be able to hold such discreet, one-on-one interviews if accused gropers, say, are allowed to bring colleagues into the sessions.</p>
        <p>They are also wondering about the practicalities of choosing witnesses. In unionized workplaces, workers take their union steward along when they expect a confrontation with a supervisor. ''Shop stewards can't object like a lawyer would, but they're able to add some guidance because a unionized workplace is covered by the collective bargaining agreement,'' Mr. Salvatore said. He added that it was unclear who would fill this role in a nonunion workplace.</p>
        <p>Whatever the concerns of management, advocates for workers say the new ruling could be a plus for both sides. Steven Platt, president of the National Employment Lawyers Association, whose members represent employees, said the presence of a co-worker during a dismissal might defuse some of the tension and rage that now prompt some fired employees to come back with guns.</p>
        <p>''Where we see workplace violence, it usually happens because people feel like they have no recourse,'' Mr. Platt said.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for both sides said there would not be a wave of demands for witnesses any time soon. Even under the new ruling, employers will not have to invite witnesses to meetings unless their workers ask them to. And nonunion workers are not likely to be aware of their right to do so. But if an employee does ask for a witness in a meeting, the supervisor must now provide one.</p>
        <p>The case in question involved the Epilepsy Foundation of Northeast Ohio and two employees, Arnis Borgs and Ashraful Hasan. Mr. Borgs and Mr. Hasan had a falling- out with their supervisor and sent memorandums complaining about him to the executive director of the nonprofit foundation. The executive director was furious and demanded that Mr. Borgs meet with her and the supervisor. Mr. Borgs, knowing that a reprimand was on the way, said he wanted to take Mr. Hasan along. The director refused and later fired Mr. Borgs, who then took the matter to the labor relations board.</p>
        <p>This was not the first time that the agency had been asked to consider the issue. In 1982, it ruled essentially the same way it ruled this week, that nonunion workers could take co-workers to disciplinary meetings. But the composition of the board changed over the course of the Reagan and Bush administrations, and the board began to rule in subsequent cases that the right to a witness was limited to union workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt said the new ruling reflected the waning influence of two Republican administrations and a shift in philosophy resulting from eight years of Democratic appointments and financing decisions.</p>
        <p>In Cleveland, Steven Moss, a lawyer who represented the Epilepsy Foundation, said he would appeal the ruling to federal circuit court. Although the board ordered the foundation to give Mr. Borgs and Mr. Hasan their jobs back, Mr. Moss said his client would not do so until all legal remedies had been exhausted.</p>
        <p>Because the board was divided, with a three-member majority and two strong dissents, the law could change again, Mr. Moss said, depending on which party wins the presidential election this fall.</p>
