        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt has emerged high on Al Gore's list of possible running mates, people close to the vice president say. But there is a big problem: Mr. Gephardt's advisers insist that he wants his name scratched.</p>
        <p>In fact, the advisers said a Gephardt emissary today telephoned Warren G. Christopher, who is leading Mr. Gore's search, to tell him that Mr. Gephardt would not fill out a detailed questionnaire about his voting record and would not hand over any financial and personal information because he did not want to be considered.</p>
        <p>The advisers to Mr. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said he had breakfast with Mr. Gore on Saturday at the vice president's residence here -- at Mr. Gephardt's request -- to tell him personally the reasons why the vice president should not pick him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's resistance underscores the difficulty Mr. Gore may be facing in finding an appealing choice.</p>
        <p>Several Gore advisers agreed that there seemed to be a dearth of options with sizzle.</p>
        <p>For all his appeal as a seasoned, respected politician from the hotly contested state of Missouri, many Democrats said Mr. Gephardt was far from electrifying. And his advisers said he would rather stay where he is, poised to become speaker if the Democrats win back the House.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of good people around, but I don't think the Democratic Party has done a particularly good job of showcasing them, and we're paying a price for it,'' said Robert Strauss, a former Democratic national chairman and wise man of the party.</p>
        <p>Among others under close consideration, said prominent Democrats and people close to the process, are Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Bob Graham of Florida, former Senator George Mitchell of Maine, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois and Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's demurrals are frustrating an already frustrating search. At his breakfast with Mr. Gore, Mr. Gephardt's main argument was that his selection as the vice-presidential candidate would greatly complicate the Democrats' drive to retake the House. He also argued that if Mr. Gore became president, Mr. Gephardt could be more helpful to him in Congress.</p>
        <p>''He's not in any way trying to be cute,'' a Gephardt confidant said. ''He would be very happy if they picked someone else.''</p>
        <p>It could be, of course, that Mr. Gephardt is being cute. His advisers refuse to declare flatly that he would never take the job under any circumstances. And Jack Kemp, who was Bob Dole's running mate four years ago, recalled that he had repeatedly told Mr. Dole he did not want to be picked.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Would you be interested in being my running mate?' '' Mr. Kemp said in an interview. ''I said, 'Well, I'm flattered but I don't know that I'm the best running mate. You need an attack dog and I'm not known as an attack dog.' ''</p>
        <p>It could be, as often happens in presidential politics, that the Gore campaign is floating Mr. Gephardt's name as a trial balloon. Who really knows the vice president's intentions? Probably only Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper; Mr. Christopher, and, maybe, William M. Daley, the campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Warning of the dangers of all the uninformed speculation, Michael Whouley, one of Mr. Gore's top strategists, said, ''None of the sirens of conventional wisdom have actually had a conversation with Apollo.''</p>
        <p>Despite the uncertainty, Mr. Gore's overtures to Mr. Gephardt are being taken seriously enough that they have set off maneuvering among House Democrats over who would fill Mr. Gephardt's job as the House Democratic leader and Speaker-in-waiting if he left.</p>
        <p>Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the No. 2 Democrat, telephoned reporters today to assure them that prospects for House Democrats would not be jeopardized if he was to serve as the acting leader in place of Mr. Gephardt.</p>
        <p>''I think the leadership in the caucus would rally behind me as acting leader,'' he said in an interview, ''and we would have a very close coordinated relationship with the Gore-Gephardt ticket if that's where all this moves to.''</p>
        <p>People close to Mr. Gephardt said he has thought hard about Mr. Gore's entreaties but that they posed a serious quandary for him: would he be more valuable on the national ticket or helping his party try to win back control of the House? And what about his own ambitions?</p>
        <p>Although he has long had designs on the White House, Mr. Gephardt, who is 59, decided not to take on Mr. Gore for the nomination this year so he could devote his efforts to picking up enough House seats to assure his becoming speaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt's associates said he would rather be speaker than vice president but recognized that either perch could be a jumping off point for a later bid for president. (But while several vice presidents have moved up, no speaker has ever advanced directly to the White House.)</p>
        <p>''Both races are, in my view, a tossup,'' said one person who has discussed the predicament with Mr. Gephardt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's interest is understandable. Mr. Gephardt has a deep command of the issues and is popular with many constituencies like labor, where Mr. Gore still has to do some fence mending. He could also assure Mr. Gore that the ticket would be more competitive in Missouri. Mr. Gephardt is also a seasoned campaigner who would effectively make a case for the Democrats -- and tear down Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>On the negative side, Mr. Gephardt is hardly a fresh face. And he would contribute to the feel that the ticket is composed of two longtime Washington insiders.</p>
        <p>Another problem with Mr. Gephardt was displayed today on CNN. The network was broadcasting excerpts of tense moments between Mr. Gore and Mr. Gephardt in a debate in 1988. In fact, the two had an icy relationship dating back to when they battled each other that year for the Democratic nomination, and both lost to Michael S. Dukakis. But in the last two years, their relationship has warmed appreciably.</p>
        <p>And nominees have never hesitated to turn to foes as running mates. Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp had never been pals. When John Kennedy picked Lyndon Johnson, their relationship had long been bitter.</p>
        <p>''It's a rare and wondrous event when something happens such as a Kennedy picking Johnson and Johnson taking the job, which he regretted for years,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. ''Oh God, what a torment that was for him!''</p>
        <p>Yet no one ever disputed the outcome: Mr. Johnson was crucial in assuring that the Democrats were victorious.</p>
