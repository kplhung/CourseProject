        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Vietnam and U.S. Sign Pact Aimed at Promoting Trade'' (news article, July 14): For the first time since my return from Vietnam in 1969, I now feel that the sacrifices of so many finally will have some meaning.</p>
        <p>The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the belated parades have been attempts to honor the individual soldier. But the signing of the trade agreement has truly indicated to me that Vietnam did and does exist and that it does have significance. The long amnesia of my country has ended. In recent years I have spent much time in that nation, and I feel certain that this historic opening will bear great returns for both our countries.</p>

        <p>Re ''Vietnam and U.S. Sign Pact Aimed at Promoting Trade'' (news article, July 14): For the first time since my return from Vietnam in 1969, I now feel that the sacrifices of so many finally will have some meaning.</p>
        <p>The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and the belated parades have been attempts to honor the individual soldier. But the signing of the trade agreement has truly indicated to me that Vietnam did and does exist and that it does have significance. The long amnesia of my country has ended. In recent years I have spent much time in that nation, and I feel certain that this historic opening will bear great returns for both our countries.</p>
        <p>The people of Vietnam seem to yearn for close ties with the United States. The new agreement will begin the process of developing a true friendship based on trust and mutual understanding.</p>
        <p>I may be considered a dreamer, but I can foresee the day when we are much more than trading partners.</p>
