        <p>In an unsuccessful attempt to avoid collision with a livery cab early yesterday, a garbage truck crashed into an auto repair shop and an adjacent two-story building in Brooklyn, destroying the front of the store and forcing the evacuation of the building's two apartments, the police said.</p>
        <p>The vehicles crashed into each other a short time after 1 a.m. at the corner of Bedford and Willoughby Avenues in Clinton Hill, sending the truck into the buildings and the cab into a chain-link fence across the street.

        <p>In an unsuccessful attempt to avoid collision with a livery cab early yesterday, a garbage truck crashed into an auto repair shop and an adjacent two-story building in Brooklyn, destroying the front of the store and forcing the evacuation of the building's two apartments, the police said.</p>
        <p>The vehicles crashed into each other a short time after 1 a.m. at the corner of Bedford and Willoughby Avenues in Clinton Hill, sending the truck into the buildings and the cab into a chain-link fence across the street. The two drivers and the three cab passengers were taken to Kings County Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>''It's one of those accidents where your jaw just drops at the wreckage, but you thank the lucky heavens that no one was killed,'' said Chief Rod O'Connor, head of the 57th Battalion of the Brooklyn Fire Department. ''These people walked away with their lives.''</p>
        <p>Around noon yesterday, the truck was still lodged in the auto shop, trapped under crumbled mortar and twisted metal. Across the street, the cab had been removed, but the fence was bent into a V-shape.</p>
        <p>Chief O'Connor said that rescue workers from the Fire Department arrived about 10 minutes after the crash to find the truck driver pinned behind the steering wheel. He suffered minor cuts and bruises on his head and arms and was released from the hospital after being treated.</p>
        <p>The cabdriver, Michael Lowe, 40, of Clinton Street in Brooklyn, and his passengers suffered slightly more serious injuries, but were expected to be released from the hospital within a day or two, Chief O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowe was charged with driving with a suspended license, the police said. The names of the truck driver and the cab passengers were not released.</p>
        <p>While helping the truck driver, workers heard sounds from a pile of rubble near the truck and found an injured Rottweiler. The dog, whose owner was not known, was taken to a local veterinarian.</p>
        <p>The couples who occupied the two apartments on the second floor of the building had to be evacuated through their windows because the staircase leading to the first floor was damaged in the crash. No one in the apartments was injured, Chief O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>One couple is staying with the Red Cross, and the other couple with family friends, Chief O'Connor said. They will not be able to move back into their apartments until the building is fixed, which could take several months, he said.</p>
        <p>At first, the damage to the auto shop and the apartment looked so severe that Buildings Department officials thought they would have to demolish the properties, but after the truck was removed from the building late yesterday afternoon, the buildings were found to be salvageable.</p>
        <p>The police were investigating to determine who was at fault in the crash.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Department of Sanitation said that the truck driver was a 13-year veteran and had a clean driving record.</p>
        <p>The owner of the damaged auto shop, Clifford Williams, 43, of Brooklyn, sat for several hours a few feet away, watching as firefighters and Buildings Department workers cleared the rubble.</p>
        <p>''I know if I tried to stand up, I would fall down again because I'm in so much shock,'' Mr. Williams said. ''I still can't think at this moment. My life is ruined. I still can't believe it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams arrived at work yesterday morning to find a cluster of fire trucks, police cars and news vans blocking traffic, and a garbage truck wedged into the side of the one-story auto repair shop he had owned for seven years.</p>
        <p>''This is what I did,'' Mr. Williams said. ''This was my life. I fixed cars. All I know is I have to find some other way to feed my four children, my wife. Right now, I can't feed nobody.''</p>
        <p>Andrea Turner, 24, who lives in a building next to the damaged apartments, said the sound of the crash had awakened her.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was an explosion,'' Ms. Turner said. ''My heart was pounding. I heard two loud bangs, one after the other. The building shook and I ran to my window to see what was going on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Turner said she immediately thought that people must have died in the crash, but was relieved to learn that no one had been seriously hurt.</p>
