        <p>A rare federal lawsuit in which a domestic worker accused her employer, a diplomat from Bahrain, of keeping her in virtual peonage has been settled out of court, the woman's lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now conducting an inquiry into the case, a prerequisite to any criminal charges that could be filed against the defendants, the lawyer said. Until that investigation is completed, she added, the maid, Shamela Begum, will remain in New York.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan in December, accused Mohammed Saleh, the second secretary at the Bahraini Mission to the United Nations, and his wife, Khatun, of flagrant labor law violations and indentured servitude.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the defendants had not addressed any of the suit's allegations, but instead claimed diplomatic immunity. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomatic envoys cannot be prosecuted by a host country, although according to State Department rules they are to abide by local laws, including wage and hour provisions.</p>
        <p>The settlement prohibits the parties from discussing its terms publicly. Yesterday, Ms. Begum said only that she was glad to have taken her case to court and was satisfied by its outcome. ''I thought it was more or less fine,'' she said in a brief telephone interview.</p>
        <p>In an especially strange twist to an already bizarre case, the Clinton administration, which has been pushing for greater vigilance against what the attorney general has called ''modern-day slavery,'' sided with the defense, warning that a failure to honor the defendants' immunity could lead to retaliation against American diplomats abroad. The judge, Richard M. Berman, did not throw out the case, but urged the parties to pursue out-of-court talks.</p>
        <p>A settlement agreement was reached last month, said Ms. Begum's lawyer, Chaumtoli Huq of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund.</p>
        <p>Ms. Begum, an illiterate mother of three from Bangladesh, has said her ordeal began nearly two years ago, when an employment broker in her hometown, Dhaka, arranged for her to work as a maid in Bahrain. She was persuaded to be brought to work for the Salehs in December 1998 and was kept a virtual prisoner in the family's high-rise apartment on Manhattan's East Side. They took away her passport the day she arrived, she said.</p>
        <p>For the next nine months, she said, she was forced to work seven days a week and was forbidden to leave the apartment alone. Her wages -- $100 a month, she said -- were sent to her husband in Dhaka.</p>
        <p>Ms. Begum, who speaks only Bengali, escaped from the household last summer with the help of a Bengali-speaking fruit vendor who worked nearby and a South Asian workers' rights group called Andolan -- struggle, in Bengali. She has worked as a maid in other households since then.</p>
        <p>There are nearly 800 migrant domestic workers with special visas allowing them to work for United Nations officials in New York, State Department officials said. In recent years, several have sued for back wages and other labor law violations. A few cases have been settled out of court. Others have been dismissed on the grounds of diplomatic immunity.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ms. Huq said she hoped Ms. Begum's case would prompt other women to come forward if they had been mistreated. Moreover, she said she hoped the F.B.I. would urge federal prosecutors to file criminal charges if there was sufficient evidence.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the F.B.I., Jim Margolin, said he could not confirm his agency's involvement in this or any other case.</p>
