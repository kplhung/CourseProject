        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas flew to New York to offer his support for Representative Rick A. Lazio's bid for the United States Senate yesterday, belittling Hillary Rodham Clinton with a familiar critique before an audience of Conservative Party donors in Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas flew to New York to offer his support for Representative Rick A. Lazio's bid for the United States Senate yesterday, belittling Hillary Rodham Clinton with a familiar critique before an audience of Conservative Party donors in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''You see, he's from here,'' Mr. Bush said of Mr. Lazio, a sarcastic edge to his voice. ''This is his state. He knows New York well. He also doesn't have to wear a Yankee cap to play like he's a Yankee fan.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time that Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, had campaigned alongside Mr. Lazio since Mr. Lazio was chosen to run against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazio, a Suffolk County Republican, and Mr. Bush used their back-to-back appearances to praise each other's records and credentials, and Mr. Lazio used his first joint appearance with his party's presumed presidential nominee to state his support for an antimissile defense shield that Mr. Bush backs. In another speech, Gov. George E. Pataki praised Mr. Bush's conservative ideals.</p>
        <p>But both Mr. Lazio and Mr. Bush were relatively restrained in their comments about Mrs. Clinton and the Senate race in New York, in what appeared to be an attempt not to draw too much attention to their joint appearance before a Conservative Party fund-raiser. The event posed a complication to Mr. Lazio's candidacy because Mrs. Clinton has recently sought to tie Mr. Lazio to Mr. Bush and repeatedly challenged Mr. Lazio's attempt to portray himself as a moderate Republican.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even before Mr. Lazio followed Mr. Bush into the ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel in Midtown, Mrs. Clinton, at an early-morning news conference in Long Island,  was assailing Mr. Lazio for taking Conservative Party support and appearing at its fund-raising luncheon. Referring to its Web site, the first lady ran through the party's positions several issues, including school vouchers and abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has some questions to answer about his being a Republican-Conservative candidate, about his commitment to issues that he claims to support and about his record,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The joint appearance with Mr. Bush and Mr. Lazio came during one of Mr. Bush's rare trips to New York. Although Mr. Bush said yesterday that he believes he can win New York State against Vice President Al Gore this November, most Republicans and Democrats in the state consider that unlikely, given the Democratic registration edge in New York. For the same reason, Mr. Lazio probably does not stand to gain much politically by campaigning with Mr. Bush -- whom he addressed as Buddy in his speech -- in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's remarks about Mrs. Clinton's residency are the latest indication of the extent to which the first lady's opponents believe a carpetbagger attack is effective against her. The host of the luncheon, Michael Long, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, drew laughs and cheers when he said, ''I admit sometimes when I hear people arguing about the horrible foreign menace that has suddenly appeared in New York, I don't know if they're talking about the West Nile virus or Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio returned to the same theme, if in a more subtle way, with his own speech a few moments later. ''I make this promise to you: I will be a senator from New York and for  New York,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio devoted most of his speech to talking not about Mrs. Clinton but about the need for an antimissile defense shield.</p>
        <p>''We live in a dangerous world, ladies and gentlemen,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''We have enemies. And the technology for mass destruction is spreading. My friends, I'm proud to announce today that I will be working with Governor Bush to make sure that we implement an effective missile defense system for America.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush devoted only a small part of his speech to Mr. Lazio and his race with Mrs. Clinton. ''The thing I like about Rick is that he is a decisive person,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When he made up his mind to run, he entered the race. He didn't need a listening tour.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio deferred a campaign for Senate last year at the request of party leaders who wanted Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to be their candidate. When Mr. Giuliani abruptly withdrew in the spring, because of health reasons, Mr. Lazio eagerly hopped into the race.</p>
