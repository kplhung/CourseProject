        <p>Whizzing around Camp David in golf carts and on bicycles, as if they were resort guests and not confined like prisoners of diplomacy in a pressure-cooker summit meeting, Israeli and Palestinian leaders spent their fourth day in secluded negotiations today.</p>
        <p>They divided into groups to tackle issues separately, and a senior Palestinian official who is not inside Camp David said the Americans had begun to offer proposals to bridge the gaps.</p>
        <p>With the information lid still tightly secured on the presidential retreat in Maryland, it was unknown how far the parties had progressed toward an actual agreement or whether, as some American officials believe, they had not progressed much at all.</p>
        <p>So far, they have averted a crisis,  a showy packing of the bags or a deliberate leak to the news media. But Reuters cited unidentified Palestinian officials as saying they had come close, and claiming that Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, was ready to storm out in anger after seeing the American proposals.</p>
        <p>Officials on all sides expect that the serious decision-making will begin only this weekend, despite a slow-down for the Jewish Sabbath on Saturday, and will build toward some kind of peak early next week before an unofficial deadline of Wednesday, when President Clinton is scheduled to depart for a Group of 8 meeting in Okinawa.</p>
        <p>The informal atmosphere -- including one fender-bender between negotiators' golf carts -- belies the seriousness of the mood, said Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's spokesman.  ''These are intractable issues,'' he said. ''These are issues that go to the vital interests of both of the parties, so this is very serious. You know, at times discussions are tense, but that should come as no surprise to you.''</p>
        <p>A senior Israeli official said that Prime Minister Ehud Barak's spirits remained as high as they were on the flight to the United States. At that time, the official said, Mr. Barak believed that both sides were primed to compromise because they saw only negative alternatives -- renewed violence and unilateral steps that would complicate each party's carefully nurtured international standing.</p>
        <p>Israeli and American officials are stressing to the Palestinians that Mr. Barak, whom they had soured on long before the summit talks, represented their best hope for a conciliatory peace partner.</p>
        <p>This is the picture they are painting: Despite the fragility of his new minority government, Mr. Barak, as a former general committed to forging an agreement, has the authority to sell serious concessions to an Israeli public hungry for an end to the conflict. If no agreement is reached and the relationship disintegrates into violence, Mr. Barak could end up forging a unity government with the rightist Likud Party. Or he could go to new elections, in which case either a rightist leader or a centrist with less clout as a security expert than Mr. Barak would be elected.</p>
        <p>In Israel, some cabinet ministers have been priming Israelis for possible concessions by publicly discussing some of the compromises that may be on the table at Camp David. Some Israeli-Arab lawmakers have been leaking ideas, too. None are new thoughts, but they are being aired in what seems to be an effort to ease them into the realm of the possible.</p>
        <p>For instance, Yossi Beilin, the justice minister, whose draft agreement in 1995 with Abu Mazen, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is providing a template, said on Thursday that Israel would consider swapping land with the Palestinians. That is, in order to retain some of the West Bank and annex the Jewish settlement abutting Jerusalem, it might be willing to turn over land adjacent to Gaza.</p>
        <p>And Avraham Burg, the Parliament speaker, who has served as an unofficial Israeli spokesman in Washington and New York this week, hinted that land swaps might work in Jerusalem too. Jerusalem could ''expand and shrink,'' he suggested. That is, it could gain some neighborhoods -- the Jewish ones outside its limits -- and lose others, the Arab ones within. It is an idea that would provoke volatile emotions in Israel but could help broker a solution to the thorniest issue, Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Further, an Israeli-Arab legislator, Ahmed Tibi, who used to advise  Mr. Arafat, said he had learned that both sides had agreed that Israel would relinquish the few remaining settlements in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>The periphery of Camp David drew both Israeli and Palestinian opposition leaders today. Limor Livnat, a lawmaker from the Likud party, showed up at the Thurmont Elementary School to give a piece of her mind to the hundreds of reporters awaiting any information. She opposes the summit meeting. But she was ushered out by American officials, into the parking lot, where a ragtag collection of protesters gather every day.</p>
        <p>Nabil Amr, a Palestinian cabinet minister, was similarly exiled earlier in the week. American officials are trying to keep the parts of the Camp David area that they control a propaganda-free zone in order, as one said, ''to give peace a chance.''</p>
        <p>Also on the outskirts of the summit zone, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with Palestinian opposition leaders who were barred from entering Camp David to consult with Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>She spoke with them in Emmitsburg, Md., where side conferences on issues like the environment and the regulation of the electromagnetic space shared by the two sides are supposed to be discussed. They are not being allowed to see Mr. Arafat inside the retreat because it is restricted to official delegates, American officials said.</p>
        <p>''Given the spirit of the ground rules we've put down, we indicated that we would prefer that that meeting not happen up at Camp David,'' Mr. Lockhart said.</p>
