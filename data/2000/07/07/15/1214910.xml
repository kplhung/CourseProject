        <p>From the dawn of the nuclear age a half century ago, when J. Robert Oppenheimer moved from Berkeley to the New Mexico desert and led the effort to build the atomic bomb, the University of California has been the government's close partner in running its nuclear laboratories.</p>
        <p>Even in the post-cold war era, this historic relationship has endured because of a belief that the university was uniquely suited to nurturing the independent scientific minds needed for creating these complex weapons.</p>
        <p>But suddenly, and unexpectedly, the partnership is poised for unsettling changes, and not because the threat of nuclear war has all but disappeared and the mission of the laboratories altered. The series of security lapses that have swamped the Los Alamos National Laboratory over the past year have disrupted that bedrock partnership and put the government on an uncertain new course of breaking free, at least partly, from the University of California system.</p>
        <p>The arrest last year of a scientist on charges of mishandling vast amounts of secret data, the unexplained disappearance and then reappearance of computer hard drives packed with classified material, and a growing climate of anxiety about further criminal investigations related to misplaced secrets have prompted the government to consider contracting out some duties to private companies.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has announced that he will strip the university of its oversight of security at Los Alamos and the other two government labs it manages, as well as some functions like construction management. The university would still manage the most significant tasks, for example research, insuring the reliability of the nuclear stockpile and administration. It is a shift, though, that some people feel could have subtle but profound implications for the scientists at the labs.</p>
        <p>In many ways the current tension between the government and the university reflects a wider historic clash present at Los Alamos since it inception. The scientists have long argued that without a free flow of information they cannot accomplish their tasks, while the government has contended that too much openness can harm national security.</p>
        <p>The fear is that tightening security now outside of the university's control could undermine the whole rationale for having an academic institution overseeing weapons research -- maintaining a semblance of intellectual freedom, required for scientific innovation, even while following strict secrecy provisions.</p>
        <p>The university has long argued that its solid academic reputation and influence traditionally shielded the laboratories' scientists from some potentially stifling government restrictions on communication so that sophisticated scientific research  could still be conducted. The question now is, if the university loses its ability to control security will it also lose its ability to protect the laboratories' limited intellectual freedom?</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson insisted that it would not, but said the scientists would simply have to cope because, as he put it, ''The status quo isn't working.''</p>
        <p>''What I want to do,'' Mr. Richardson said in an interview, ''is to use what the University of California does best, and take away what it doesn't do well, to enhance the overall management of the labs and perhaps establish a pattern of joint ventures with the university.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We're not punishing or scapegoating the University of California. We want to use their strengths and eliminate their weaknesses.''</p>
        <p>Sidney Drell, a professor emeritus of physics at Stanford University and a member of the presidential commission that criticized security at the government's nuclear labs last year, put it more bluntly.</p>
        <p>''It's painful for me to say, because I'm one of those scientists,'' Dr. Drell said, ''but I think the freedoms they had in the past and the open attitude are unacceptable now.''</p>
        <p>There is an even more basic concern. Many officials at Los Alamos are girding for the possible indictment of some respected, senior laboratory scientists on criminal charges for their mishandling of the disappearance of the hard drives earlier this year. The fear is that this could not only harm the lab's already substantial problems in recruiting young scientists, but could cause an exodus of senior scientists fearful of heavy-handed government prosecutions. Those fears have led some of those in charge at Los Alamos to warn that any reductions in the University of California's role should be prudent, thoughtful and modest.</p>
        <p>''I believe that whatever appears to have broken can be fixed,'' said John C. Browne, the lab's director and a university employee. ''The benefits to the country of this relationship far outweigh the problems. To me, if you go too far, it's like you're going to throw away the whole system because of a couple of bad apples.''</p>
        <p>In principle, Mr. Richardson agreed, saying that dropping the contract with the university and bringing in a private defense contractor to run Los Alamos could be devastating. If a large government defense contractor were to take over, Mr. Richardson said, ''then you would have an exodus from our labs.''</p>
        <p>University officials have expressed a willingness to negotiate a new arrangement with the Department of Energy, but clearly the institution's pride has been wounded.</p>
        <p>''It sounds arrogant to say, but we don't need this relationship for the university,'' said an official, echoing a common view. But others say that, while eager to mend the partnership, they are looking at possibly deeper changes in the future.</p>
        <p>''The point when we separate is easy enough to identify,'' said John Davies, a university regent and until recently the board's chairman. ''It's the point when the security becomes so burdensome that it drives the scientists out of the labs. For me, at this point, though, I don't think we're anywhere near that.''</p>
        <p>Rulon Linford, a former lab scientist who is now the associate vice provost for research and laboratory programs at the university, said: ''I think the university gets out of the deal what it has always gotten out of the deal. Its motivation is public service. If the university walked, the national security of this country would be harmed.''</p>
        <p>The relationship between the University of California system and the government began informally in the early 1940's as the Manhattan Project got under way, and it was first codified in 1943 with the historic contract W-7405-Eng-36, which established the university's management of the previously secret Los Alamos site. Eventually, the number of labs overseen by the university grew to include Lawrence Berkeley as well as Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. The Berkeley site is devoted to nonweapons research, while the other two labs do both.</p>
        <p>The relationship, however, has traditionally been bumpy. The scientists have always chafed under the government's security restrictions. Also, throughout the 1960's and 1970's, many university faculty members objected to having an academic institution so intimately involved in creating weapons of mass destruction. On several occasions committees explored the relationship and drew up alternatives, including separation.</p>
        <p>And in the 1970's, as the research at Los Alamos expanded to include the environment and energy, a consortium of Midwestern universities asked for control of the labs to utilize this new expertise. The proposal was rejected, but it led to other examinations of the partnership and a series of changes throughout the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The university says the relationship has created little in the way of financial rewards. Under the current five-year contract, which expires in 2002, the university receives a series of fees, some of which can expand or shrink, depending on performance.</p>
        <p>The fee is broken down into several components. There is a payment of $11 million to cover several federal contracts, another payment of $3.5 million to $4 million specifically to cover the costs of a central administration office, and an administration fee, adjusted to reflect performance, of roughly $14 million, but which could go as high as $16 million. About half of those fees are used to operate Los Alamos, with the rest used to pay for the other two labs.</p>
        <p>But there are some very substantial benefits to the relationship for the university. The laboratory scientists are not like faculty members at university campuses; they do not have tenure, they do not have complete academic freedom and they must comply with a large body of government rules. Also, none of the university employees at Los Alamos are unionized, although some are at the two California labs.</p>
        <p>The relationship, however, is an important recruiting tool. Many young scientists who might not be thrilled at the prospect of working at a government lab devoted to building weapons of mass destruction find the idea of being a University of California researcher far more palatable. The relationship also means that, should a scientist decide to leave the lab, getting a job in academia would be easier.</p>
        <p>For instance, Xian Chen, a young biophysicist at Los Alamos involved in nonweapons work, said the fact that he became a university employee was critical. ''That's the reason I was attracted,'' he said. ''Los Alamos has a good reputation in the scientific world.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Los Alamos has some of the fastest computers in the world and other sophisticated research equipment, all paid for by the government. Weapons scientists can use some of these tools for nonmilitary  research.</p>
        <p>''It's not a one-way street,'' acknowledged Ronald A. Nelson, the university's director for contract management. ''We get some of the scientific results of those labs and that reinforces our reputation for excellence and prestige.''</p>
        <p>And there are important financial incentives. The university system offers a lucrative retirement package that some believe is perhaps the single most important amenity offered. Also, children of Los Alamos scientists can attend the university at the same rates as California residents, a huge savings.</p>
        <p>Hugh Gusterson, a professor of anthropology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is writing his second book on the weapons labs, said that he believed the supposed intellectual freedoms were a myth. Historically, Mr. Gusterson said, the university has not stood up for scientists who had angered the government, which is certainly the case in the recent series of security lapses. But the economic benefits, he maintained, have been crucial.</p>
        <p>''The retirement package is incredibly important,'' Professor Gusterson said. ''But it's my own view that the labs wouldn't be very different without the University of California. They've been sort of an absentee landlord. I think the U.C. element has always been this little carrot the recruiters could dangle.''</p>
        <p>The reality now is that the priorities are changing, and whatever protections the university could provide for the scientists involved in sensitive research will be diminished.</p>
        <p>''The present climate has already cost them young people,'' Dr. Drell said. ''The question is how we stop it and protect the quality of the labs. The university is at its moment of truth in standing up to this, and finding a way to make all this work. I don't think the tensions are unreconcilable, but they are more difficult.''</p>
