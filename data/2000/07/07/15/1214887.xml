        <p>The continuing Up in Smoke tour, featuring the rap superstars Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Ice Cube and Nate Dogg, was supposed to clean up rap's reputation for attracting violence at concerts and other live events.</p>
        <p>The promoters hired a crew with experience on Kiss, Pink Floyd and Aerosmith tours and booked more than two solid months of dates in major arenas across the country. So far, the concerts have been punctual, professional and attended by all of the headliners, the tour's promoters say. Musically and visually, the tour -- full of explosions, elaborate sets, and videos -- has set a new standard for live rap spectacles. It has also managed to avoid the audience flare-ups that have given other rap shows play on police radios. By all accounts, it will be among the highest grossing tours of the year.</p>
        <p>But for the tour's performers, things haven't been so smooth. Since opening night in Chula Vista, Calif., on June 15, the rappers have been dogged by more arrests, controversy and tragedy than the characters in an HBO drama. As of now there are at least five criminal charges pending against the performers, along with a First Amendment skirmish involving a breasts-and-bullets video shown as a warm-up to the headliners. Some editors of concert industry magazines are surprised that the tour, which reaches the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., tonight, hasn't already gone up in smoke.</p>
        <p>Despite the trouble-free success of more recent hardcore rap roadshows like the Hard Knock Life tour featuring Jay-Z and DMX, live rap is still looked at skeptically, especially since five people were stabbed in April in a backstage scuffle at a Ruff Ryders/Cash Money concert in Boston.</p>
        <p>Even with all the headlines, the promoters are more than happy. ''We'll take a little controversy over the content -- and it is insignificant content -- over a substantive issue like a security problem or violence any day,'' said Bill Silva, the president of Silva Touring, part of the promotion team. He added: ''We're firing on all cylinders. But has Eminem had some personal problems? Has Snoop Doggy Dogg gotten into a little trouble?''</p>
        <p>The moral might be that, no matter how big and frequent the problems, as long as they don't occur onstage or in the audience, they don't stand in the way of a successful tour.</p>
        <p>The personal problems began shortly before ''Up in Smoke'' started. As Eminem's second album, ''The Marshall Mathers LP,'' sat at No. 1 on the charts (as well as on the hit lists of women's and gay rights organizations for its misogynistic and homophobic content), the Detroit rapper was held on two weapons charges arising from two events on the same day.</p>
        <p>In the first, he was accused of waving a gun during an argument with an employee of Insane Clown Posse, his rival Detroit rappers; in the second, according to police reports, he found his wife kissing another man in a parking lot and pulled a gun on him. Eminem has maintained his innocence in both situations,  and his wife has said that if she had wanted to cheat on Eminem, she would have found a more private place to do it.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, the rapper made it to Chula Vista. After that first show, Snoop Dogg's tour bus was stopped by law enforcement agents who confiscated 300 grams of marijuana. A member of the rapper's entourage said the drugs were his, and he was booked on a misdemeanor possession charge, allowing the tour to roll on unscathed.</p>
        <p>Two days later, Nate Dogg was arrested in Pomona, Calif., and charged with assaulting his girlfriend, holding her against her will and setting fire to her mother's car. He was released on $1 million bail after being charged with kidnapping, making terrorist threats, domestic violence and arson. And the tour rolled on.</p>
        <p>A new set of problems arose at a concert last week in Detroit. The  press secretary for Mayor Dennis Archer and a police commander appeared backstage and threatened to halt the concert and arrest performers if they showed an eight-minute video that is part of the concert's production. They also threatened to arrest parents accompanying underage children for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>
        <p>Worried that a riot would result if electrical power was pulled on the show, promoters chose not to screen the video, a John Woo-style action short featuring Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg lounging with topless women and then shooting up robbers in a liquor store. In addition, law officers at the show insisted that the blow-up dolls that Eminem uses as props be clothed. Yesterday, lawyers for Dr. Dre filed a lawsuit against the city, claiming First Amendment violations.</p>
        <p>The next night in Auburn Hills, Mich., Mayor Tom McMillan and the local police again tried to yank the video, but a United States District Court Judge, Nancy Edmunds of Michigan's Eastern District, prevented it, saying that a ban would violate First Amendment protections. The video was shown, but after the show, police officers charged Dr. Dre with promotion of pornography in addition to citing the arena, the Palace at Auburn Hills, where the Detroit Pistons basketball team plays, for liquor license violations.</p>
        <p>As that took place, Eminem's wife, Kim, the victim in domestic violence fantasy scenarios on both of Eminem's albums, was rushed from her home to the hospital by paramedics after a suicide attempt. And today, the tour still rolls on, with Eminem miraculously making it to every show.</p>
