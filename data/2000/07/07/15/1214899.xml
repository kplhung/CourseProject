        <p>The American and Canadian railroads that were planning to combine resources to create a rail system spanning North America lost a court appeal yesterday and will probably end up scuttling their proposed $6 billion merger.</p>
        <p>A federal court in Washington upheld a temporary ban on railroad consolidations that was imposed in March by the Surface Transportation Board of the United States. The board had frozen action on all mergers after the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation and the Canadian National Railway Company announced plans to put together a vast freight network that would crisscross the United States and Canada and offer service into Mexico, too. Their merger would have been the largest in railroad history.</p>
        <p>The railroads argued that the board lacked the authority to impose such a ban and could only approve or reject merger applications. But the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 2-to-1 decision released yesterday morning, ruled that the board had not exceeded its statutory authority.</p>
        <p>The decision effectively upheld the ban that began on March 17 -- the day the board originally imposed the moratorium -- and runs until June 2001.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement, the two railroads expressed disappointment over the court's decision but did not signal their next move.</p>
        <p>''Neither B.N.S.F. nor C.N. will speculate about its options,'' the statement said. ''The managements of C.N. and B.N.S.F. will discuss the ruling's implications for their proposed business combination, and each will consult its respective board of directors.''</p>
        <p>Both companies already have quarterly board meetings scheduled for this month. The Burlington board is to meet next Thursday, and the Canadian National  board on July 24. Spokesmen for the railroads refused to say whether the future of the proposed merger or any further legal action, including a request for a rehearing or a filing with the Supreme Court, would be discussed at those meetings.</p>
        <p>But analysts are almost certain that the deal will be stopped.</p>
        <p>''The deal is dead for the foreseeable future,'' said James M. Higgins, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He said that the Burlington Northern board in particular was impatient and unwilling to be held up for more than a year during which anything could happen.</p>
        <p>In comments shortly after the ban was imposed in March and the railroads had filed their appeal, Robert D. Krebs, the chairman of Burlington Northern, expressed doubt that the deal would go forward if the moratorium was not overturned. In answer to a question at a luncheon in Washington on March 24, Mr. Krebs said the economic climate in the industry would change so much during the postponement that the proposed merger would probably no longer make sense.</p>
        <p>At that same luncheon, Mr. Krebs also expressed concerns about the Surface Transportation Board's announced plans to consider new rules and regulations governing mergers that would be different from those under which the venture had been planned by the two railroads. And he said that the uncertainty generated by such a long delay would hurt investors and further depress the rail lines' stocks.</p>
        <p>The board itself acknowledged that financial markets would react negatively to a moratorium, but it found that such danger would be outweighed by the potential consequences of moving forward ''without appropriate rules in place at the beginning.''</p>
        <p>Since the plans were disclosed in December, railroad stock prices have gyrated wildly in reaction to expectations about what federal regulators in Washington would do. Over all, Burlington Northern shares have fallen more than 5 percent this year, while Canadian National declined a bit more than 1 percent. Both were up slightly today as investors responded positively to the court's action because they believed that some of the uncertainty that has dogged the rail lines since the merger was proposed had been lifted. Shares of Burlington Northern rose 68.75 cents, to $26.9375, while Canadian National also jumped 68.75, to $30.75.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, the plans of the two large carriers to create a coast-to-coast, cross-border rail network have been both praised and condemned. The new system would include 50,000 miles of track and combined annual revenue of $12.5 billion. Analysts liked the fact that despite their huge dimensions, the two systems overlapped in few places. Railroad executives promised that few jobs or miles of parallel track would be lost.</p>
        <p>But the vision of a transcontinental railroad came just as shippers and manufacturers that use the rails were adjusting to a previous round of mergers that had greatly disrupted service and left a large number of rail clients unhappy. Many feared that the Burlington-Canadian National combination would bring on even more mergers and leave North America with just two very large national railroads, a situation that, critics feared, would decrease competition and lower the responsiveness of the railroads to client needs.</p>
        <p>Federal regulators in Washington say that more consolidation is likely in the rail industry. They say they imposed the moratorium to review regulations and make sure the industry develops in an orderly way.</p>
