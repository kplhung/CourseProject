        <p>The second straight failure of a test for the proposed national missile shield has set off a barrage of criticism. But such breakdowns are routine in ambitious rocketry programs, even ones that eventually succeed, several military and industry experts outside the Pentagon say.</p>
        <p>The comments suggest that in the long run, a much larger challenge to the program will come from critics who say that no matter how well the shield eventually performs in the tightly controlled tests, it will be all but worthless in practice.</p>
        <p>''It's clearly the case that they'll be able to make this system work against a simple, laboratory-designed threat,'' said Dr. Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in military policy. ''These failures someday will end. However, it doesn't mean it can defeat a real-world threat.''</p>
        <p>Many doubts about the shield are based on the contention that decoys could always confuse an interceptor to let a warhead slip through. For their part, officials in the antimissile program maintain that the system can sift through the decoys.</p>
        <p>But among technically knowledgeable observers on all sides of the debate, there is a remarkable range of agreement that the shield's fattest target for criticism at the moment -- the generally low-tech breakdowns that have caused the test failures -- say little about whether the program will eventually succeed.</p>
        <p>''Every program has gone through failures,'' said Louis Deeter of Quantum Research International in Huntsville, Ala., a retired colonel who for three years was government program manager of the Army's theater high-altitude area defense, or Thaad, antimissile effort.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's anything, today, that says the system won't work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the test last week, a modified Minuteman rocket topped by a so-called kill vehicle was launched into space from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. With the help of radar and satellite data and its own sensors, the kill vehicle was supposed to fire its thrusters and guide itself into a collision with a mock warhead, pulverizing it.</p>
        <p>Instead, the final stage of the two-stage rocket began tumbling, and then the simple mechanism that was supposed to release the kill vehicle from the booster did not function properly, said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.</p>
        <p>''This is not new technology,'' Colonel Lehner said. ''There has never been a problem with that particular technology.''</p>
        <p>He said Pentagon analysts were examining second-by-second telemetry data from the flight to determine exactly what went wrong.</p>
        <p>In the previous test, last January, the kill vehicle separated properly from the booster. But the vehicle missed the target because a cooling line clogged, shutting down its heat-seeking sensors.</p>
        <p>And in October, the Pentagon described the system's first intercept test a complete success, but later was forced to concede that the kill vehicle had drifted off course and locked onto a decoy balloon. It turned out that the kill vehicle's navigation system had been loaded with an incorrect star chart, and that the guidance system suffered from a drift.</p>
        <p>Those failures were similar to the basic mechanical breakdowns, electrical shorts and software flaws that led to a spate of recent failures in launchings of commercial booster rockets for lifting satellites into space and in the test program for Thaad, which is a less ambitious antimissile system that is meant to protect troops.</p>
        <p>For instance, in April, during a string of six failed launchings in nine months, a protective shroud covering a payload failed to detach from a Lockheed Martin Athena 2 rocket, dragging an earth-imaging satellite back into the atmosphere, much as the Minuteman did with the kill vehicle last week.</p>
        <p>In July 1996, one of six consecutive misses by Thaad was apparently caused by particulate contamination of its seeker eye, a problem similar to the one that derailed the national missile defense test in January.</p>
        <p>''The launch business is absolutely unforgiving,'' said John F. Willacker, vice president for space launching operations at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, Calif., who was involved in several critical reviews of the booster program.</p>
        <p>But after what Mr. Willacker called a ''return to fundamentals'' involving management changes and redoubled quality-control procedures, the booster program returned to flawless launchings.</p>
        <p>The Thaad program followed its heavily criticized failures with two hits last year after a reorganization of the testing program and extensive analysis of the problems. Earlier missile and antimissile programs, with names like Sprint, Patriot and Polaris, had similar histories of repeated failure followed by success, at least in controlled tests.</p>
        <p>David E. Mosher, a policy analyst at the Rand Corporation who specializes in nuclear weapons and missile defense, said the national missile shield would ''need a couple more good failures'' before the crisis atmosphere that surrounded the Thaad misses could be expected to set in. But he added, ''This is a hard thing to do, and you should expect failure.''</p>
        <p>Colonel Lehner said that pending the Pentagon's investigation of the miss last week, the system's next test is expected to take place in October or November.</p>
        <p>Some experts cautioned that whatever the technical relevance of the problems, another miss would exact a steep price in political criticism of the program.</p>
        <p>''The overall program has not tested successfully,'' said Janne Nolan, director of International Programs of the Century Foundation, who sits on the Defense Policy Board, which advises the Pentagon. Until it does, she warned, ''there's no there there.''</p>
