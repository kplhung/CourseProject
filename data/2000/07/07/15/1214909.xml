        <p>The gloom surrounding the bankruptcy of the Sogo Company, a major retailer that owes more than $17 billion, was dispelled somewhat today after Japan's Finance Minister said the failure would not undercut the economic recovery and Standard &amp; Poor's called the bankruptcy necessary medicine for the Japanese banking system.</p>
        <p>But there were also signs that another big Japanese corporate debtor, worried about suffering the same fate as Sogo, might be bailed out.</p>
        <p>And there was speculation that the financial weaknesses exposed by the Sogo bankruptcy and its aftermath might dissuade the Bank of Japan from raising interest rates at its policy meeting on Monday. Up until the Sogo collapse, there had been considerable expectation that the central bank was prepared to raise rates for the first time in a decade.</p>
        <p>Sogo, an operator of 25 department stores and an employer of 10,000 people, sought bankruptcy protection Wednesday after a public outcry over a government-backed plan to use taxpayer money to keep the company alive and forgive some of its  debts amassed during the speculative boom years in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The bailout plan collapsed after Shinsei Bank, a big Sogo creditor that was recently purchased by foreign investors, balked at forgiving any Sogo debts.</p>
        <p>The Sogo bankruptcy, one of the biggest in Japan, could now create a domino chain of failures among Sogo suppliers and others dependent on the 170-year-old retailer.</p>
        <p>Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese Finance Minister, offered some reassurance today that the impact of Sogo's collapse would be limited. ''I don't think it would be substantial as the economy is rebounding,'' he told a news conference in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's also eased some of the anxiety about Sogo, calling the decision to abandon a bailout a positive step. ''While Sogo's reversal may lead to an immediate increased incidence of corporate bankruptcy, the long-term effects may be more beneficial for the Japanese banking industry,'' the ratings agency said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, Japanese news reports said Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, one of the biggest banks, was planning to help the Hazama Corporation, a major construction company, avoid what had befallen Sogo. The reports said the bank might buy some of the debts that Hazama owed to Shinsei -- the same bank that helped precipitate Sogo's bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Should Dai-Ichi take on Sogo's Shinsei loans, that would send a clear signal that the system of so-called convoy capitalism is still alive in Japan. That system, in which banks lend to borrowers to keep them afloat rather than make a profit, was supposed to have died after the financial crisis that nearly toppled the banking system here in late 1997.</p>
        <p>Moreover, new data on bankruptcies released today suggests that one of the biggest challenges the government will face this year is how to prevent insolvency from tipping the banking system into another crisis.</p>
        <p>Changes in the law that make it easier for companies to seek court protection have helped increase bankruptcies to nearly record highs. Corporate bankruptcies rose 32.2 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, as 9,304 companies went under, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit research company.</p>
        <p>Hazama owes Shinsei 42 billion yen, or about $389 million, and Japanese newspapers said Dai-Ichi was preparing to buy the 30 billion yen of those loans not covered by Shinsei's reserves.</p>
        <p>Dai-Ichi was careful today not to deny the stories. ''We are the main bank of Hazama, and our policy is we would like to support the company,'' a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>He said no decision had been made to buy Hazama's Shinsei loans.</p>
        <p>As part of a broad request for 105 billion yen in debt relief from four banks, Hazama has already asked Shinsei to forgive 12 billion yen to 15 billion yen in loans.</p>
        <p>Sogo had made a similar request as part of a broad restructuring plan, but Shinsei refused to go along. Instead, Shinsei asked the government to take on its loans to Sogo under terms of an agreement reached last year that put the bank into the hands of a group of foreign investors headed by Ripplewood Holdings L.L.C.</p>
        <p>The government first agreed to forgive Sogo's Shinsei debts, but politicians, facing a torrent of public criticism, abandoned the plan, forcing Sogo into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>There was a possibility that the Hazama story could play out the same way. But Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has strong reasons to keep construction companies like Hazama afloat.</p>
        <p>The ties between the Liberal Democrats and the construction industry are legendary. Much of the spending on public works that has contributed to Japan's huge public debt load is a reflection of those ties, as are the piles of debt accumulated by construction companies struggling to survive during the economic downturn of the last decade.</p>
        <p>Construction companies keep people employed, and that employment is translated into votes. And Japan is forever awash in rumors of kickbacks between politicians and general contractors.</p>
        <p>''The banks want this debt-forgiveness plan, because if Hazama goes through a public bankruptcy process, various types of collusion between the construction industry, politics and the bureaucracy might surface,'' said Yoshito Sengoku, a member of Parliament from the opposition Democratic Party who played a major role in shaping the bailout of the banking system in late 1997 and early 1998.</p>
