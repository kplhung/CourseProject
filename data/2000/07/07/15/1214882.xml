        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It's disheartening to see even staunch opponents of law-enforcement excesses dismiss the racial overtones in the Philadelphia police rampage caught on videotape (front page, July 14). That some officers of color took part in the terrifying melee that preceded the arrest of a suspected car thief is irrelevant.</p>
        <p>The fact remains that the man being pummeled and kicked by law enforcement, Thomas Jones, is black. So, too, are an alarming proportion of the victims of police misconduct. What makes police brutality a bigoted phenomenon is not the race of the perpetrators, but that its targets are most often those who are poor and of color.</p>
        <p>In this respect, the brutal assault on Mr. Jones is no different from other cases of police abuse. So long as racial profiling remains an entrenched part of law enforcement culture, and police officers, regardless of their race, are taught to view all people of color as likely criminals, then the specter of race cannot be so easily ignored when police brutality is shown in plain light.</p>
