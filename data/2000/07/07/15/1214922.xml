        <p>The Justice Department closed its criminal contempt of court case against Charles G. Bakaly III today by portraying the former spokesman for the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, as eagerly disclosing confidential information to make the counsel's office look important.</p>
        <p>Two F.B.I. agents quoted Mr. Bakaly as telling them that he had seized on an opportunity presented by questions from The New York Times about the future of the office, but then felt the article had not hidden his role as a source. ''I played a risky game, and I got burned,'' an agent, Thomas F. Lewis, quoted him as saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bakaly is charged with making false statements to government officials when he denied providing sensitive information to The Times for a Jan. 31, 1999, article that portrayed Mr. Starr as having decided he could indict a sitting president.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said Mr. Bakaly told him that ''reporters need to be fed information,'' and that the questions from The Times offered an opportunity to tell the public that even if the Senate acquitted President Clinton, ''the independent counsel's office was not going to go away.''</p>
        <p>Another agent, Russell P. Robinson, said Mr. Bakaly told him the message he wanted to send from the Office of the Independent Counsel was ''in the event there was an acquittal in the Senate case, the O.I.C. could move forward with its indictment.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Bakaly argued for a directed verdict of acquittal, saying the prosecution had not even made a minimal case that he had lied in denying discussing secret information. Mr. Bakaly's lawyers have portrayed him throughout as earnestly seeking to deflect the article away from the details of what was going on in the prosecutor's office and toward a historical approach.</p>
        <p>Michele A. Roberts, a defense lawyer, said the government had a ''burden to prove to the court that these matters were nonpublic matters'' and could have tried to do so by showing that none of the information had been published before, or by getting Mr. Starr to testify that the issues Mr. Bakaly discussed with The Times were secrets. By doing neither, she said, the government forfeited its case.</p>
        <p>Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of Federal District Court here said she would rule on the motion on Monday. But she told the defense to be ready to proceed with its case. She is hearing the case without a jury, which is permissible under the law of criminal contempt because the Justice Department had promised not to seek a prison sentence of more than six months.</p>
        <p>The article appeared in the midst of Mr. Clinton's Senate trial, and it produced angry complaints from his lawyers and from Judge Johnson. Both charged that the story revealed secret information from the grand jury. But last fall a federal court of appeals said information about the prosecutor's strategy was not protected grand jury material.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say that by making false or misleading statements -- in particular the denial of discussing ''nonpublic matters'' -- Mr. Bakaly delayed the investigation of the disclosure and wasted the court's time. Judge Johnson ruled that such delays would constitute contempt; the defense has said it will appeal the ruling if Mr. Bakaly is convicted.</p>
        <p>Much of today's argument dealt with how much of a secret it was that Mr. Starr was considering four options -- to indict Mr. Clinton quickly, to indict him but keep the indictment under seal until he left office, to wait until he left office to indict him, or not to indict him. Several government witnesses have conceded under cross-examination that those choices are always available and did not constitute any secret.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 27, 1999, all of the Starr office lawyers debated the options in a lengthy meeting, and on Jan. 28, according to an F.B.I. agent, Michael Erbach, the Times reporter, Don Van Natta, brought them up with Mr. Bakaly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson testified that two independent counsel lawyers, whom he did not name, sent a memo around the office the day after The Times article ran, saying that from its detail, ''it appeared as though Mr. Van Natta was at the all-attorney's meeting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis revealed another detail about that meeting. He said Mr. Bakaly told them that Mr. Starr's deputy, Jackie Bennett, told him the lawyers present had taken a straw vote on whether Mr. Clinton should be indicted. But he did not give the result of the vote.</p>
