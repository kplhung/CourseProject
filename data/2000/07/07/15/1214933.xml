        <p>Tomorrow in Antwerp, the World Diamond Congress will meet to write new rules for the treatment of diamonds from war zones. Diamond traders and manufacturers are reacting to public concern about diamonds mined illicitly by warlords in Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo to finance wars fought largely for control of their country's mineral wealth. The industry, realizing that bad publicity could devalue a product whose only worth comes from consumer perception, is eager to certify that it sells only clean stones. An effective certification system, however, requires independent monitoring, which the industry has so far resisted.</p>
        <p>The diamond controversy began in Angola. When the United States cut off its cold war aid to  the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, he turned to diamonds. Since 1992 at least $2.5 billion in diamonds have emerged from territory Mr. Savimbi controlled, the majority purchased eventually by De Beers, the diamond giant, which had a policy of buying and hoarding excess diamonds to keep the price up. De Beers denies that it bought diamonds from the rebels knowingly, but few experts believe this.</p>
        <p>Angola's diamonds have extended a war that has killed half a million people in the last decade and made the country one of the world's most miserable. Diamonds also finance a vicious rebel movement in Sierra Leone and a war in Congo that has drawn in countries from across the continent.</p>
        <p>The United Nations has led an international effort to curtail the trade in diamonds from areas convulsed by war. In 1998, the Security Council banned the purchase of Mr. Savimbi's diamonds, although the embargo was widely violated. Last March the Security Council published a surprisingly strong report that accused several African leaders of sanctions-busting and said that the central diamond clearinghouse in Antwerp -- the world's largest market for rough diamonds -- had ''extremely lax controls.'' Recently the Security Council banned the purchase of diamonds from Sierra Leone. Global Witness, a London nongovernment group, has also been important in raising public concern about conflict diamonds.</p>
        <p>In March, De Beers said it would guarantee that its diamonds did not originate in war zones. This week it told its 125 major trading partners that they had to do the same, or lose De Beers's business. This shift is part of De Beers's overall attempt to rescue its sinking profits. Its diamond stockpile is now seen as a drain of its capital, and De Beers faces increased competition. It will stop hoarding diamonds and try to become known as a brand name for clean diamonds. The announcement will also keep trading partners from working with the competition.</p>
        <p>The diamond industry plans to follow De Beers's lead, setting rules that would establish a paper trail accompanying diamonds from the mine onward. Legitimate exporters like South Africa and Botswana are particularly enthusiastic about reform. But a certification system will not be effective unless governments pass the necessary laws, prosecute sanctions-busters and solve technical challenges like preventing certificate forgery. This is likely to happen, but the industry so far has resisted the important step of having independent experts monitor the certification process.</p>
        <p>Unlike other industries accused of bad global citizenship, the diamond trade has been quick  to decide that reform can serve its members' interest. But the industry is secretive and insular, and members have lied in the past about traffic in diamonds from war zones. Their embrace of new rules is welcome, but should not be trusted without verification.</p>
