        <p>The Florida authorities are investigating a letter that purports to be from Gov. Jeb Bush to a Florida member of Congress that the governor's office says is a forgery.</p>

        <p>The Florida authorities are investigating a letter that purports to be from Gov. Jeb Bush to a Florida member of Congress that the governor's office says is a forgery.</p>
        <p>The letter, which claims to detail Mr. Bush's position on legislation now before Congress to ban gambling on the Internet, was addressed to Representative Cliff Stearns, Republican of Florida, and dated June 23. Mr. Stearns said in a statement that he never saw the letter.</p>
        <p>The letter says Mr. Bush is opposed to the bill on the grounds that it would prevent the state from selling lottery tickets online and would infringe on states' rights. The document has been circulating on Capitol Hill for the past several days and has been used by opponents of the measure as an argument for its defeat.</p>
        <p>But the letter is a forgery, Mr. Bush's office said today. ''We don't know where it came from,'' said Justin Sayfie, Governor Bush's communications director. ''It is not his position. It is not the governor's signature. It is not his letter. It is not authorized. And it is troubling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sayfie said that Governor Bush had taken no position on the bill. Neither has Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, an aide said.</p>
        <p>The genesis of the letter became clear late today, although its authorship remained a mystery.</p>
        <p>An official of Shandwick Washington, the Washington subsidiary of Shandwick International, a major public relations firm based in London, got in touch with Governor  Bush's office last month to request a letter stating Mr. Bush's position on the gambling legislation, said Mark Day, a Shandwick spokesman. Shandwick requested that the letter be addressed to a member of Congress, Mr. Day said.</p>
        <p>Shandwick represents eLottery Inc., a Connecticut company that provides computerized services for state lotteries and would profit from online sales of lottery tickets. The Internet gambling legislation would prohibit sales of lottery tickets on the Internet; it is opposed by eLottery and several other lottery vendors.</p>
        <p>Shandwick said it had hoped to get a letter from Mr. Bush stating his opposition to the bill -- as they had from several other governors -- because it would inhibit electronic sales of lottery tickets and infringe on states' rights. Mr. Day said that Shandwick received the letter in late June and immediately began circulating it on Capitol Hill, hoping to generate opposition to the bill.</p>
        <p>''We requested of Governor Bush's office, and received, a copy of a letter to members of Congress, which we had every reason to believe originated in the governor's office,'' Mr. Day said. ''It appeared to be on official stationery and contained what appeared to be an official signature. We later learned that the governor's office did not authorize the letter and disavowed it. We immediately stopped using the letter and urged others to do the same. If there's a problem with the letter we believe absolutely we should get to the bottom of it.''</p>
        <p>Charles A. Degliomini, senior vice president of sales and marketing at eLottery, referred questions about the matter to John M. Haddow, partner in the Washington lobbying firm Symms &amp; Haddow Associates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haddow said that he and eLottery officials were angry about the letter and ''furiously trying to find out the source of this.''</p>
        <p>''It's obviously not a valid letter,'' Mr. Haddow said. ''I can't tell you how much this annoys me and my partner.'' Mr. Haddow's partner is Steven D. Symms, a former Republican Senator from Idaho.</p>
        <p>The bill is expected to come before the House for a vote next week. The measure seeks to curb the growth of wagering on the Internet, particularly on casino-style games and sports. Many governors oppose the bill because it would deny them the option of selling lottery tickets online.</p>
