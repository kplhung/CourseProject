        <p>No one outside the Kremlin is quite sure why, or what it portends, or even whether it will last very long. But after nine long years of fabulous high living and seeming immunity from the rules that govern mere mortals, Russia's infamous tycoons have suddenly found themselves marked men.</p>
        <p>At least, some have. Whether they continue to be targets will say much about whether President Vladimir V. Putin's much-vaunted ''dictatorship of the law'' is in fact that or is more in the mold of the last Kremlin, where the rich played by their own laws.</p>
        <p>In the last week, Russia's government has launched public campaigns of legal and political pressure against the titans who run five of the nation's most powerful business combines, including the largest oil company, automaker, metals processor and power utility.</p>
        <p>In short order, government agencies have lodged tax-evasion charges against the No. 1 petroleum company, Lukoil, and the automaker AvtoVAZ.</p>
        <p>They demanded in a letter that the tycoon who owns 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, a vast Siberian mining company, repay $140 million supposedly shorted the government when the company was privatized in the early 1990's. A similar complaint was filed against Tyumen Oil, another big petroleum company, in late June.</p>
        <p>And today, the Russian Parliament's Audit Chamber took aim at the electricity monopoly RAO-UES, accusing it of illegally selling a stake to foreigners when part of the state-owned company was auctioned to the public in 1992. The chairman of RAO-UES is Anatoly B. Chubais, who was former prime minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin and who oversaw the early privatization of Russian industry, including UES.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chubais is reviled by many average Russians as the symbol of Russia's economic collapse. But he remains the godfather of right-wing politics here and an icon of the very free-market policies Mr. Putin has demanded that Parliament enact this summer.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Chubais called the accusations against RAO-UES unfounded -- a ''red revanche'' led by Parliament's Communists, he said -- but added that he was worried by their political implications.</p>
        <p>Whether founded or not, it would be hard to find in the gold rush that was Russia's early transition to capitalism anyone who did not play fast and loose with the few rules of the time.</p>
        <p>But the political implications of this new campaign have left almost everyone scratching their heads. For it is hard to tell, yet, whether the rash of attack on the so-called oligarchs is the payoff on Mr. Putin's longstanding pledge to apply the same laws to both the tycoon and the kiosk operator, or the beginning of some darker and more subtle bloodletting.</p>
        <p>''People are looking for clarity on this,'' said Thomas Graham, a former American diplomat who is now a Russia scholar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</p>
        <p>''On one hand, everybody wants to see the thievery stopped,'' he said today, ''and I think most people realize these oligarchs' empires were built in an illicit fashion. But if it looks like this is being politicized, it create problems for investors in Russia and for the government.''</p>
        <p>Politics has been high on most observers' minds since May, when the first major attack was sprung against Vladimir A. Gusinsky and his Media-Most empire, a collection of print and broadcast outlets that are among the Kremlin's most influential critics.</p>
        <p>In the last two months, various government offices have staged armed raids on Mr. Gusinsky's offices, seized a gun once awarded him by Mr. Yeltsin, accused him of swindling the government in the sale of a television station, and briefly jailed him in one of Moscow's most notorious prisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has chided his government for being overly enthusiastic in its pursuit of Mr. Gusinsky, but has otherwise been silent, leaving the question of whether he has approved such assaults or is simply tolerating them because he lacks the political power to call them off.</p>
        <p>To some experts, the challenges are distinguished by two traits: Many involve owners of powerful media companies, and none touch those tycoons who are said to be closest to the Kremlin and the people who made Mr. Putin president, the friends and relatives of Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>Lukoil has extensive interests in newspapers and local television. The power behind Norilsk Nickel, Vladimir Potanin, is an investor in the national daily Izvestia. The man behind AvtoVAZ, the much-maligned tycoon Boris A. Berezovsky, took control last year of Russia most respected and powerful business newspaper, Kommersant.</p>
        <p>Yet to feel the government's sting is Roman Abramovich, a Yeltsin-family intimate whose Sibneft oil empire was formed from one of the most notorious privatization schemes in the mid-1990's. Nor has Mr. Putin's government been especially cooperative in Switzerland's investigation of another Yeltsin family friend, Pavel Borodin, who oversaw a Kremlin restoration project that has become the object of a sprawling bribery and money-laundering investigation.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Yeltsin resigned, Mr. Putin moved Mr. Borodin out of the Kremlin to an honorific job as head of a body overseeing a slow-moving economic union of Russia and Belarus.</p>
        <p>But there are other theories as to why the tycoons are suddenly under assault. One is that the tycoons themselves are jockeying for advantage in the new Putin government, using their remaining power to muscle various state agencies into persecuting their rivals. By that explanation, Mr. Putin is at least in part a bystander to a fight that is not entirely in his control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin himself seems of two minds. In an interview today in  Izvestia, he said ''tax evasion and other abuses acquired a mass scale and became routine'' in Russia's early years, and so it was natural for those who benefited from the loose rules of the time to oppose a crackdown now.</p>
        <p>''Many businessmen today have found themselves in the 'zone of risk,' in potentially difficult relations with the law,'' Mr. Putin said. ''So, how can't they be but nervous?''</p>
        <p>But at the same time, he said, ''businessmen are now trying to settle scores with one another by using state structures and law enforcement bodies.'' He added: ''An end should be put to this. Otherwise, further damage will be inflicted by such actions.''</p>
        <p>One longtime political expert, Vyachaslav A. Nikonov, a former member of Parliament, said in an interview today that an internal battle among the tycoons was a possibility.</p>
        <p>But it is equally likely, he suggested, that Mr. Putin has simply given his government free rein to go after the tycoons, both for political gain and for the immense riches that the tycoons control, and which the government would like to tap.</p>
        <p>And if that is not enough, he said, the Kremlin has an obvious reason to soak the very richest Russians: The very poorest ones, who vastly outnumber them at the polls, have been salivating at the prospect for close to a decade.</p>
        <p>''It's just popular,'' Mr. Nikonov said. ''It's absolutely perfect politics. People in the streets are absolutely delighted with this.''</p>
