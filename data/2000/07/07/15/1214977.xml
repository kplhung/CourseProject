        <p>To Joe Torre, Roger Clemens seemed especially antsy pacing around the clubhouse before last night's game with the Florida Marlins. There was a look of concern on Clemens's stoic face, the look of a proud pitcher who knew there were still serious questions about his approach and about just how human he was.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday Clemens unleashed a 92-mile-an-hour fastball that barreled into Mike Piazza's batting helmet, sending him crumbling to the dirt and leaving him with a concussion. Clemens was heavily criticized for a pitch -- against a batter who had dominated him -- that seemed to have too much purpose attached to it.</p>
        <p>Torre does not talk to his starters on the days they pitch, so he did not say anything to Clemens, but he watched him. He watched Clemens retreat to the bullpen 15 minutes earlier than usual and watched him struggle through a tedious first inning.</p>
        <p>Something was wrong with Clemens early in the game. Maybe, Torre suggested, it was the weight of one misplaced fastball.</p>
        <p>''I think it went beyond the publicity,'' Torre said. ''It was more that they were accusations. I wasn't comfortable with that. I thought he was unjustly accused. Everywhere you go, people were looking at him like he was some kind of ogre.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, Clemens got comfortable and helped the Yankees glide to a 6-2 victory over the Marlins at Yankee Stadium. Clemens buzzed Preston Wilson with a chest-high fastball four batters into the game, immediately reiterating that the inside corner belonged to him and that he would pitch there to control and even to scare batters.</p>
        <p>The Yankees like seeing him do that, and they have preached this to Clemens every time he loses confidence in his fastball. As unnerving as it was for everyone to see Piazza's vacant eyes staring into the dark sky, the Yankees are pleased he is fine and happy that Clemens can be motivated by the incident.</p>
        <p>Last night Clemens shouted at some hitters and he pumped his fist after strikeouts, but he was subdued after winning his third straight start. Clemens claimed he had thick skin, but it was not thick enough.</p>
        <p>''I feel I'm a more aggressive person when I'm on the mound, but that's my livelihood,'' Clemens said. ''I take it as special, being here. I take a lot pride in it, but I'm not going to go out and try to hurt another person. I'm going to make adjustments to try and get him out if I'm getting wore out.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said that he ''felt awful'' about what happened with Piazza. He said he had a game plan against Piazza, but it did not include hitting him in the head. One Yankee said that Clemens wanted to move Piazza's feet to back him off the plate. Still, even though Clemens admitted he did not want to go ''to that extreme'' with Piazza, he added, ''It won't change my plan on pitching inside.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are weary of hearing about Clemens's pitch to Piazza, but Clemens and the team must deal with the repercussions for the rest of the season.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner insisted that Clemens did not throw at Piazza and Torre asked whether the intense scrutiny would have happened if a less talented player had been plunked. That does not matter.</p>
        <p>Seeing any player dazed and lying in the dirt after a beaning is a rare and frightening sight, whether it is Piazza or Benny Agbayani. Clemens threw the pitch that caused a concussion, so he must deal with the questions and the consequences. If Mike Hampton had hit Derek Jeter in the head, the Yankees would still be complaining.</p>
        <p>Despite the criticism Clemens received for hitting Piazza and for not even leaving the mound to check on Piazza's condition, Clemens might use the incident to boost him. He has been called a thug, but he is the Yankees' thug, so they will support him and hopes this makes him better. It did not hurt him last Saturday or after the first three innings last night.</p>
        <p>Two minutes after Clemens decked Piazza, he was tossing warm-up pitches to stay loose. He might have looked concerned for a few seconds, but Clemens never lost focus. Even as some fans booed and even as Manager Bobby Valentine and several Mets yelled expletives at Clemens, he never flinched and pitched seven and one-third solid innings in a 4-2 victory.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line, not to disrespect anybody, is the fact that he won,'' Torre said. ''That's what he's here to do.''</p>
        <p>Clemens is not changing. The early pitch to Wilson told the Marlins that. The Marlins had runners on in all seven innings Clemens worked, but they were 1 for 9 with men in scoring position off him and Wilson's two-run homer was the only damage.</p>
        <p>Clemens might have seemed bruised by the criticism, but his next fastball could still end up under a batter's chin.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I've been doing enough pitching inside, but you have to do it,'' Clemens said. ''I have to do it to be successful. That's what's gotten me to this point in my career.''</p>
