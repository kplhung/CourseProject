        <p>Francois Simon awoke this morning with a song in his heart. So did Christophe Agnolutto, Didier Rous, Stephane Heulot and nearly 30 other French riders in the Tour de France.</p>
        <p>That song was ''La Marseillaise,'' the French national anthem. Today was July 14, the French national holiday. If a French rider wins the Tour stage on this day, he is celebrated nearly forever, sometimes for as long as several months. Who was the last Frenchman to win on the Quatorze? Few in the vast Tour entourage seemed to recall that name or date.</p>
        <p>What they did remember, as the French often do, were past indignities on this day. Those indignities, as they often do, centered on foreigners.</p>
        <p>Outrage was generally expressed: remember the time, a few years back, when Djamolidine Abdoujaparov -- an Uzbek! -- won the July 14 stage? Remember last year, when Giuseppe Guerini, an Italian, finished first? What next, many asked, a Belgian? A Croatian?</p>
        <p>No, a Spaniard.</p>
        <p>The stage today was won by Vicente Garcia-Acosta, 27, a humble worker for the Banesto team from his homeland. In his fifth year as a professional, with two previous victories to his credit and a world ranking of No. 309, Garcia-Acosta split from two traveling companions with 11 kilometers (7 miles) to go and rolled to a festive victory.</p>
        <p>He clapped his hands, he punched the air, he gave thanks to the heavens, he carried on as if it were Oct. 12, the Spanish national holiday, celebrating Columbus's discovery of America, rather than July 14.</p>
        <p>Garcia-Acosta was timed in 4 hours 3 minutes 2 seconds, a rapid 45 kilometers an hour, for the 185.5-kilometer 13th stage from Avignon east to Draguignan in the hills behind the Cote d'Azur. Conducted in sunny and breezy weather, the race was watched by huge crowds, especially at the start -- with thousands on Avignon's ancient walls -- the finish and atop three small climbs en route.</p>
        <p>To add to the fans' disappointment, the two riders the Spaniard left in his wake were Frenchmen. Nicolas Jalabert of the ONCE team and Pascal Herve of Polti were second and third, 25 and 27 seconds too late respectively to save the day.</p>
        <p>Once a 12-man breakaway of low-ranked riders took form about 60 kilometers along, the pack was content to let it have its head on narrow and zigzaggy roads past perched villages and the occasional vineyard. Including all the overall leaders, the main pack arrived 10:06 behind the winner.</p>
        <p>That changed basically nothing because Garcia-Acosta began the day in 46th place, nearly 29 minutes behind. Jalabert, the younger brother of the star Laurent Jalabert, and Herve were in similar dungeons.</p>
        <p>So Lance Armstrong, the head of the U.S. Postal Service team, continued to be secure in the overall leader's yellow jersey, nearly five minutes ahead of Jan Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom and the winner of the 1997 Tour.</p>
        <p>After Armstrong's performances in the first two mountain stages --- two second places and a daunting display of easy power -- none of his rivals appear to be overly optimistic about the coming three stages in the Alps. They begin Saturday and continue Sunday and Tuesday, with Monday a day off.</p>
