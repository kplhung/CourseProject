        <p>Denny Neagle has worn No. 15 most of his career, owing to his preference for low numbers. But Neagle has discovered that picking a number is a lot more complicated with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Neagle learned that that number was retired by the Yankees, for Thurman Munson. Looking at a Web site with friends, he checked into the possibility of asking for No. 16 -- and ascertained that number was retired in honor of Whitey Ford.</p>
        <p>Neagle is currently assigned No. 41, but may switch before Monday, when he is scheduled to make his first start for the Yankees, against the Philadelphia Phillies. Neagle joined the Yankees yesterday, grinning broadly when he shook hands with Joe Torre, his new manager, and greeted teammates. ''It's a little weird, too,'' Neagle said. ''I grew up in Maryland, a huge Orioles fan, and I grew up hating the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>He is one of them now, and, at the same time, he is nothing like them.  Neagle is known for his sense of humor, his lighthearted manner, the noises he can make -- such as a stunningly perfect train whistle, which he did during a news conference, seated next to Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman and Kim Ng, the assistant G.M.</p>
        <p>''How about that whistle?'' Cashman remarked, as he approached reporters after Neagle finished answering questions.</p>
        <p>''I definitely like to have fun,'' Neagle said. ''I'm going to wait until I have a feeling about who the guys are who I can have fun with, and who are the guys I should stay away from because I'll be getting my butt kicked.''</p>
        <p>He will get some slack with the Yankees, who traded top prospects to get him from the Reds Wednesday and who have made him a part of their long-term plans. Neagle can become a free agent after this season, and Cincinnati traded him after he rejected a three-year, $18 million deal. It is more likely that Neagle will end up with a contract like the one signed by Minnesota's Brad Radke, four years for $36 million.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to win, and I'd be foolish not to listen to any offers from the Yankees,'' said Neagle, whose negotiations with the team will probably begin after his first start next week.</p>
        <p>No Broken Bones</p>
        <p>The outline of a baseball seam is imprinted at the base of Chuck Knoblauch's left thumb, and his hand is swollen and bruised, after he was hit by a line drive during Thursday's loss to the Marlins. But extensive testing on his wrist yesterday revealed that Knoblauch did not have any broken bones, and he hoped to return to the lineup as soon as today. ''Hopefully, we'll get that little bit of swelling out of there,'' Knoblauch said, gesturing at his wrist, which was covered with blue wrapping.</p>
        <p>Florida's Preston Wilson smashed the liner at Knoblauch, who jumped, attempting to reach for the ball with his glove. But Wilson's drive bounced off the heel of Knoblauch's hand and into center field, and Knoblauch dropped his glove and clutched his left hand. He was immediately replaced at second base.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch may be ready to bat before he is ready to resume playing defense, because the bruising does not affect his swing. For at least a couple of days, Knoblauch's bruise will probably continue to bother him when he fields ground balls.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch has already missed 19 games because of injuries to his left hand and wrist, and incredibly, the injuries have been unrelated.</p>
