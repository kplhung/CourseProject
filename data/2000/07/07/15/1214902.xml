        <p>The proportion of low-birthweight babies, those born weighing less than 5.5 pounds, has been growing steadily since 1984, a federal report released this week says. Most of the rise can be attributed to the rapid increase in the number of multiple births, especially to older white mothers using assisted-reproduction techniques like in vitro fertilization and drugs that increase ovulation.</p>
        <p>Such techniques often produce twins, triplets or quadruplets, who are far more likely than single babies to be born prematurely, and tiny. The number of twin births rose more than 50 percent from 1980 to 1997, while the number of triplets quadrupled -- with white women older than 45 having the highest rate of multiple births.</p>
        <p>''Multiple births and assisted-reproductive technologies account for the bulk of the increase in low-birthweight babies,'' said Dr. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. ''It's become a substantial concern among OB-GYN's, who are beginning to step back a little, I think.</p>
        <p>''For example, if they get seven healthy fertilized embryos in an in vitro attempt, they might put two or three back in, not all seven. The problem is with the older mother, who may have only one shot at pregnancy and wants them all. And then you get into whose embryos are these, anyway?''</p>
        <p>Blacks traditionally have had a higher rate of multiple births than whites. But with more whites turning to assisted reproduction, that gap has narrowed substantially; white mothers are now more than twice as likely as blacks or Hispanics to have triplets.</p>
        <p>Nationally, the age of women giving birth has been creeping up; Massachusetts has become the first state where women older than 30 now make up the majority of new mothers. And older women, over all, run a higher risk of delivering a low-birthweight baby.</p>
        <p>The growing number of low-birthweight babies is intensely troubling to health policy makers, who have devoted enormous resources in the last three decades to new programs intended to offer easy access to prenatal care, in hopes of solving the low-birthweight problem.</p>
        <p>''Starting back in the 1960's, there were all these programs to provide care to low-income women earlier in pregnancy, and we thought it would really make a difference,'' said Dr. Alexander. ''The low-birthweight rate did go down in the 70's, but since the middle of the 1980's, it's been going up. You have no idea how frustrating it is.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the latest year for which statistics are available, low-birthweight babies made up 7.6 percent of the nation's births, according to the report, ''America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well Being 2000,'' which was released on Thursday. While the current rate is not quite as high as the 7.9 percent rate in 1970, it has climbed substantially since the low of 6.7 percent reached in 1984.</p>
        <p>''In spite of all logic and expectations, and everything we'd like to see as policy makers, it's been very difficult to show that prenatal care can reduce low birthweight,'' said Dalton Conley, a sociologist at New York University who studies low-birthweight babies. ''We still assume it makes a difference, but the research doesn't show the effects.''</p>
        <p>Low-birthweight babies are a serious health concern, because such infants are far more likely to have vision and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy or impaired intellectual ability.</p>
