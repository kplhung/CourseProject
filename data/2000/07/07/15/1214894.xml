        <p>For Sevgi Pinarci and her family, the scorching temperatures that have swept Turkey and southeastern Europe over the past 10 days amount to heaping insult on top of injury.</p>
        <p>Since a devastating earthquake last August destroyed their home, Mrs. Pinarci, her husband and their two children have been living in a tiny two-room makeshift shanty in a rubble-filled vacant lot. There is no electricity, no running water and no relief from temperatures inside the shack that have reached more than 120 degrees.</p>
        <p>''It's so hard for the children to sleep because even at midnight it's like the hot sun at noon,'' said Mrs. Pinarci, 38, as her husband, Omer, 39, and two sons, Kaan, 13, and Bahadir, 9, looked on.</p>
        <p>Temperatures in the region eased somewhat today, but the effects of the prolonged heat wave were still being felt from Romania to southern Turkey. Crops, already suffering from a summer drought, were damaged further. Water levels in reservoirs dipped, threatening irrigation and hydroelectric plants. And firefighters continued to battle wildfires on both sides of the Aegean Sea in Greece and Turkey.</p>
        <p>At the height of the heat, with temperatures topping 100 degrees, the authorities in Romania and Bulgaria ordered trains to stop running because they feared that tracks would buckle from the heat. The only nuclear plant in Romania was temporarily shut down after heat inside reached 158 degrees and set off sprinklers.</p>
        <p>Parts of Croatia were declared a  disaster area as the effects of the drought on crops was magnified by soaring temperatures. Officials predicted crop production would be 40 percent to 70 percent lower than last year because of the weather. Crops were also damaged in Bulgaria, Romania and Macedonia.</p>
        <p>In Greece, high temperatures and strong winds helped ignite and spread more than 100 wildfires and led Prime Minister Costas Simitis to order emergency services on maximum alert. ''Every available force has been mobilized, and we hope we can bring the situation under control,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fire temporarily threatened the ancient town of Corinth, 50 miles southwest of Athens, and other blazes cast a brownish pall over the capital city.</p>
        <p>The scorching heat has claimed at least 50 lives across southeastern Europe and more than 20 in Turkey,  and has sent hundreds of people to hospitals. In Istanbul, the temperature topped 110 degrees and broke a 60-year-old record. In other parts of the country, temperatures reached 130 degrees and higher.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey ordered government offices closed Thursday and today to lessen the danger to workers and ease the drain on the country's electricity resources.</p>
        <p>Highways were so softened by the heat in parched central Turkey that the Ministry of Public Works banned truck traffic during daylight hours for two days because the vehicles were digging deep gouges into the asphalt. Istanbul police officers were issued sunblock lotion and sandals, and were permitted to take showers during short breaks at the hottest times of the day.</p>
        <p>But few showers were available for the tens of thousands of Turks who have been living in prefabricated houses, tent cities and shantytowns since the earthquake last Aug. 17, which killed at least 17,000 people and left as many as 500,000 homeless. While the government has quickly rebuilt main highways, progress has been slow in returning people to damaged homes or building new housing.</p>
        <p>A government spokesman said there are 35 official tent cities, housing about 30,000 people, throughout the region damaged by the earthquake. But the official figures do not count all of the people who are still homeless.</p>
        <p>Here in Adapazari, a city of about 180,000 some 100 miles southeast of Istanbul, the Pinarcis are among seven or eight families who have built ramshackle homes on a vacant lot not far from their damaged homes. They bring in fresh water by bottle, cook with propane tanks and wash their clothes in plastic tubs.</p>
        <p>Even as temperatures moderated and slipped below triple digits today, the darkened bedroom of their two-room shanty was stifling, and a hot wind blew a layer of dust across everything in the open-ended kitchen area. Sitting at a plastic table beneath an umbrella outside the shack, Mr. Pinarci complained that they had been unable to join hundreds of other families in government-provided prefabricated houses because local authorities said their own house was not damaged badly enough. But he said the house is unsafe, and he refused to allow his wife and children to live there.</p>
        <p>Winter was difficult, he said, but the last 10 days were even worse. ''The heat,'' he said mournfully, ''has been very bad, very bad.''</p>
