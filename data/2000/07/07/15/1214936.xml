        <p>Annika Sorenstam is precisely where she wants to be going into next week's women's United States Open, which she has won twice in the last five years. After winning only twice last season following 10 victories in the previous two years, Sorenstam's game is good enough to challenge Karrie Webb for the top spot in women's golf.</p>
        <p>The 29-year-old Sorenstam, who won last week, took a giant stride toward her fifth title of the year by shooting a six-under-par 65 today in the second round of the Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam is in second place at eight-under 134, a stroke behind Allison Finney, who shot 66 and is at nine-under 133 after two rounds of the $900,000 event, the only stop in the metropolitan area for the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour.</p>
        <p>On the 6,161-yard Wykagyl Country Club course, which plays to par-71, Finney shot a 66 with six birdies and a bogey, including birdies on two of the last three holes.</p>
        <p>Finney, who missed the cut in four of the last five tournaments, broke 70 for the first time year. While Sorenstam has 22 victories, including four this season, Finney has one, in 1989.</p>
        <p>''Karrie is No. 1,'' Sorenstam said about Webb, who is at even-par 142. ''But I know inside I am pretty good again.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam completed her round moments before play was suspended for 1 hour 40 minutes because of a heavy downpour.</p>
        <p>''I feel good about my game again,'' Sorenstam said, ''and I have a lot of positive thoughts about myself. I go back to the successful years in my career and that gives me confidence. Golf is about confidence, and I have a ton of confidence right now. I'm playing well and I'm putting real well for me. So, I think I'm coming into next week as good as I can.</p>
        <p>''This golf course is good preparation for the Open,'' she said about the Wykagyl layout. ''I'm looking into this tournament as the best preparation. I have high expectations because I've done so well before.''</p>
        <p>Sorenstam was the winner of the United States Open in 1995 and 1996.</p>
        <p>Sorenstam said she recently played 27 holes in an outing at the Merrit Club in Liberytville, Ill., site of next week's Open, and she liked the course.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot like here,'' she said. ''It's not just long. You also have to place them on the greens.''</p>
        <p>Like most players, Sorenstam found Wykagyl's par-3's the strength of the course and the par-5's short enough to score well.</p>
        <p>It was the eagle-3 on the 432-yard 15th that helped Sorenstam to her 65, when she holed out a shot from the bunker.</p>
        <p>The winner of this tournament two years ago, Sorenstam proceeded to birdie two of the next three holes and made three more birdies. She had five consecutive 3's on her card from No. 4 through No. 8, and her only mistake was a bogey, on the 379-yard 14th, where her approach found the bunker.</p>
        <p>Finney, who was also the first-round leader, said the rain delay helped calm her nerves and also softened the greens considerably.</p>
        <p>''The rain was a bonus for me,'' Finney said. ''The greens were also receptive and I had a lot of tap-ins.''</p>
        <p>Rosie Jones was alone in third place at 135. She was steady as ever, missing just one fairway in two days. She had three birdies and no bogeys today and she liked her chances.</p>
        <p>''The golf course suits my game because you have to hit your drives straight and you need to manage the course, which is the best part of my game,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Seventy players from the starting field of 143 made the cut at four-over 146.</p>
