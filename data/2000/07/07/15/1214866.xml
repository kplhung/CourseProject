        <p>A large and enthusiastic, even jubilant crowd went to the auditorium of the Society for Ethical Culture on Thursday night for the second concert in the Lincoln Center Festival's Electronic Evolution series. Quite a crowd was there onstage, too, enthusiastic and even jubilant themselves, to play in Terry Riley's ''In C'' for an hour into the late evening.</p>
        <p>This was billed as the first performance of ''In C'' by an all-electronic ensemble, and it was exciting to see on the same platform such a diverse array of people and machines: Robert Moog and one of his classic synthesizers, Donald Buchla and an apparatus from which sounds were squeezed out by mallets, Zeena Perkins and a small electronic harp making decisive attacks, Pauline Oliveros on accordion, two members of the X-ecutioners niftily handling turntables, Greg Howard adding grungy harmonies on his Chapman stick, John Musto and George Steel often keeping the pulse steady and fast on a Yamaha Disklavier, and many more, on instruments both standard (electric guitar, ondes martenot, theremin) and irregular.</p>
        <p>With them was Michael Barrett, not to conduct but usefully to introduce the players and their sounds, and then to provide occasional hand signals and otherwise fondly observe. The performance began with iterations of C on the Disklavier, and that was where it ended, but with the addition of patterings from Karsh Kale's E-Tablas.</p>
        <p>In between, figures and timbres came and went in a tumbling mix held tight by the pulsing. Like people on a bus, some of the musicians stood out because they were louder or more brightly dressed, in terms of sound, while others were part of the background, contributing to the often dense, rich harmonies and the playtime atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Occasionally the complexity of the sound would suggest a voice, and the repeating figure a verbal phrase that this voice was trying to utter, without being able to pronounce the words clearly. Such moments recalled Scott Johnson's ''Worth Having'' from the first half, a piece in which four musicians pick up speech melodies from recorded voices. But where Mr. Johnson's piece was expressive -- sometimes unsettling, sometimes funny -- in ''In C'' the passing events are about as meaningful as cocktail-party conversations. They have to be there: otherwise there is no party. But it is the party that matters.</p>
        <p>Besides ''Worth Having,'' the first half included solo spots for two of the ''In C'' participants. Valerie Hartmann-Claverie made a brave stab at transferring Messiaen's ''Le Merle Noir'' from flute to ondes martenot, but the effect was awkward: the music was expecting a wind player's phrasing and a wind player's effort. Lydia Kavina had a more fruitful task in Martinu's Fantasia for theremin with piano quintet and oboe, a piece that also had some unexpected connection with ''In C'' in its repeating mixed-up chords. It was hard, though, to take one's eyes and ears off Ms. Kavina's nimble plucking, stroking and grasping of sounds in the air as she stood at her theremin. She gives a remarkable performance and should not be missed when she returns to the festival on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Whitman Quartet, which played in the Martinu, also gave an outstanding account, spooky and spiky, of George Crumb's ''Black Angels.''</p>
