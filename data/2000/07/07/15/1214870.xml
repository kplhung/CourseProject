        <p>Doug Varone loves to make dancers seem like people who are trying to get together and be sociable. That was clear when his company, Doug Varone and Dancers, performed on Wednesday night as part of the American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University here. But this performance in Reynolds Industries Theater also suggested that Mr. Varone knows full well how difficult it can be for people to get together and remain together happily.</p>
        <p>The nine dancers in ''As Natural as Breathing,'' a premiere commissioned by the festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work, sometimes acted as if they were at a party. But they moved much of the time behind a scrim in misty lighting by David Ferri. And the accompaniment was a recorded medley of jazz and pop tunes in arrangements that made them sound like the sentimental or almost desperately jolly music one might hear in a half-empty cocktail lounge late on a rainy night. If this was a party, the audience beheld it from a distance.</p>

        <p>Doug Varone loves to make dancers seem like people who are trying to get together and be sociable. That was clear when his company, Doug Varone and Dancers, performed on Wednesday night as part of the American Dance Festival on the campus of Duke University here. But this performance in Reynolds Industries Theater also suggested that Mr. Varone knows full well how difficult it can be for people to get together and remain together happily.</p>
        <p>The nine dancers in ''As Natural as Breathing,'' a premiere commissioned by the festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work, sometimes acted as if they were at a party. But they moved much of the time behind a scrim in misty lighting by David Ferri. And the accompaniment was a recorded medley of jazz and pop tunes in arrangements that made them sound like the sentimental or almost desperately jolly music one might hear in a half-empty cocktail lounge late on a rainy night. If this was a party, the audience beheld it from a distance.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Varone snapped his fingers, the scrim rose, but the mood did not immediately brighten. Mr. Varone danced a slow, slinky solo that made him look lost in thought. Then, one by one, the women in the cast and some of the men as well tried to embrace him as if they were craving affection. During the finale, all the dancers moved together in a single squirming mass.</p>
        <p>''As Natural as Breathing'' was a lovely, bittersweet work. And what does Mr. Varone think is as natural as breathing? Dancing, surely. Perhaps longing as well.</p>
        <p>Choreographic forces in two other effective pieces also kept bringing dancers together and splitting them apart. ''Possession,'' to Philip Glass's Concerto for Violin and Orchestra, opened with eight dancers clinging to one another as if they were trying to survive hard times. Then came two quartets. In the first, Larry Hahn, Merceditas Manago, Gwen Welliver and Mr. Varone moved hesitantly, sometimes touching one another, at other times clasping empty air or gesturing as if they were signaling.</p>
        <p>They were replaced in the second quartet by Nancy Bannon, Daniel Charon, Adriane Fang and Eddie Takeeta, who appeared to be swept across the stage by the power of the music. Near the conclusion, the dancers from the first quartet walked sadly onstage only to walk off just as sadly almost immediately. These eight dancers who were once together now seemed fated to be apart.</p>
        <p>Whereas Mr. Varone's other creations showed people struggling to establish contact, ''Sleeping With Giants'' abounded with striking images of rejection. It began with eight people running furiously to the clamorous sounds of Michael Nyman's Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra.</p>
        <p>But the choreography soon turned Mr. Hahn into someone who could not keep up with everyone else. He became increasingly isolated from his companions, who initially seemed at least faintly sympathetic to his plight. Next they ignored him. Finally they attacked him violently.</p>
        <p>The dance can be interpreted as a scathing denunciation of a competitive, youth-oriented society that brutally rejects anyone who cannot keep up with its rat race. Mr. Varone's choreography seems both to burn with anger and weep with compassion.</p>
