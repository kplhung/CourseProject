      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For tobacco companies, getting the $144.8 billion punitive damage award handed down yesterday by a Miami jury reduced, and even possibly thrown out, may be the easy part.</p>
        <p>But fighting this one case may be the least of the industry's problems.</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago the idea that an individual smoker could legally triumph against a tobacco producer was unthinkable. Now, even though the industry scores most wins, that has changed. And the Miami panel's decision yesterday in the first class-action case to go to a jury has taken producers across an ever deeper and more troubling legal Rubicon.</p>
        <p>''For the moment, this is the realization of the industry's 50-year nightmare,'' said Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford University. ''And that nightmare was that when the dam burst it would burst catastrophically.''</p>
        <p>It was one thing when cities and states started to line up to sue the industry. It is another if the millions of Americans who believe they became ill from smoking can start lining up to file claims. And many experts believe that yesterday's verdict is likely to encourage more lawyers to bring similar claims in other states. And the size of the verdict may also cause jurors in other smoking cases to become more liberal.</p>
        <p>''I believe that it will tend to ratchet juror verdicts upward,'' said Peter Schuck, a Yale law professor who has served as a legal consultant to a cigarette company.</p>
        <p>Both cigarette company executives and tobacco industry analysts shrugged off the Florida verdict. Offering a first glimpse at what is likely to be a protracted appeals process, they said the two-year-long state trial had been riddled with procedural errors and would be thrown out on appeal.</p>
        <p>In addition, tobacco industry lawyers have long argued that a class-action case involving all Florida smokers -- a group that may involve between 300,000 to 700,000 people -- should never have been allowed to go forward because members of the group had all decided to smoke for different reasons and at different times.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there are any financial ramifications to this decision,'' said David J. Adelman, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''The scale of the verdict speaks to the absurdity of the process.''</p>
        <p>But there is little question that tobacco producers saw yesterday's verdict coming.</p>
        <p>In May, as the Miami case progressed, a strange consortium of industry lobbyists, Florida officials and plaintiffs' lawyers involved in recent state tobacco lawsuits successfully pushed a bill through the Florida Legislature.</p>
        <p>That bill limited to $100 million the amount that a defendant in a Florida lawsuit had to post to appeal a verdict. Under the previous rule, a defendant had to post the entire verdict to appeal, an amount that given the size of yesterday's award, may have driven several producers, if not all, into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Judge Robert Kaye of Miami-Dade  Circuit Court, who is presiding over the case, may decide as soon as Monday whether to enforce the bond limit. And presuming that he does and that Stanley Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the Miami case, cannot get the new Florida appeal measure declared unconstitutional, the tobacco industry will have plenty of financial breathing room while its appeals proceed.</p>
        <p>But how far they may want to pay the string out is another issue. On Wall Street, the huge award will likely hang over the value of the companies' stock. And while industry lawyers said they were confident that a higher Florida court would dissolve the class-action cases on procedural grounds, other experts are not so certain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rabin, the Stanford professor, said that while the Florida State Supreme Court previously deferred ruling on the appropriateness of a class action by smokers, their lack of action might not be a welcome one for producers.</p>
        <p>''They have let the ball keep rolling so long and the case has become so protracted that it seems unlikely they will turn around now and say this case should not have happened in the first instance,'' Mr. Rabin said.</p>
        <p>Others disagree. But now both producers and Mr. Rosenblatt, the plaintiffs' lawyer, find themselves in a box with both tremendous stakes and risks that could drive both closer to settlement talks, something they have previously resisted, said Stephen Sugarman, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt, despite his victories to date, could see them quickly wiped out by an appeals court.</p>
        <p>For their part, tobacco producers could roll their appeals' dice and lose. A settlement could also wipe out much of yesterday's award. But for the industry, settling the case might bring on more class-action lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sugarman said he had no idea how the Florida case would eventually play out. Butone lawyer who has worked with the tobacco industry said that whatever happened in Miami case, its meaning was clear.</p>
        <p>''They may get the Florida verdict reversed to zero,'' that lawyer said. ''But this corroborates that the industry cannot win the litigation battle.''</p>
        <p>UPDATE  The Tobacco Docket</p>
        <p>The tobacco companies are facing a flood of court actions that involve hundreds of individual actions and scores of class-action lawsuits in this country alone. Other countries have filed lawsuits that are pending in United States courts, while other nations are pursuing suits in their own courts. Among the class-action lawsuits and cost-recovery lawsuits pending in the United States are these compiled by The Associated Press:</p>
        <p>Trial is scheduled for Jan. 15 in Louisiana in a class-action suit seeking reimbursement to smokers for the costs of visits to doctors and quitting smoking.</p>
        <p>Other class-action suits have been filed in dozens of states.</p>
        <p>Several health insurers, including the Healthcare Association of New York State, are suing tobacco companies for the costs of treating people with smoking-related illnesses.</p>
        <p>The United States Justice Department filed suit last September to recover money spent by federal health-care programs to treat smoking-related illnesses.</p>
        <p>In February about 4,000 tobacco farmers filed an antitrust suit, accusing cigarette makers of conspiring to reduce their purchases of tobacco from farmers. Nearly 2,000 additional plaintiffs joined the suit in May.</p>
