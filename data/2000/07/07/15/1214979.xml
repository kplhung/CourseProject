        <p>The Clinton administration wants the World Trade Organization to make it easier for companies to sell services across international borders. The administration said in a framework paper submitted to the Geneva-based trade body that a current round of talks on banking, insurance, energy, postal, environmental, professional and travel services should become more ambitious and should aim for a conclusion by 2002 even if there is no new global trade summit meeting by then. The European Union wants to address services only as part of broader trade talks.</p>
