        <p>Police Department officials yesterday defended two internal investigations they conducted last year into an organization that represents black officers and into its president, saying they had not been intended to silence the group, which has been a persistent critic of the agency.</p>
        <p>The investigations were revealed Thursday by Deputy Chief Raymond King, an Internal Affairs Bureau commander, who briefly outlined the inquiries into the organization, 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care and its president, Lt. Eric Adams, during his testimony in a federal lawsuit in which the group is not involved.</p>
        <p>He said that each of the investigations had been closed without any finding of wrongdoing but that as part of the inquiry, undercover officers had followed Lieutenant Adams intermittently over the course of several months and had obtained his organization's phone records.</p>
        <p>''The investigative techniques they used were consistent with an investigation of this nature,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey, a department spokesman.</p>
        <p>But critics said the investigations seemed to be a retaliatory effort to spy on dissidents, reminiscent of the Police Department's surveillance of black groups in New York City in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>''The mayor and police commissioner must give immediate answers to the many questions this investigation raises,'' said C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president. ''Who ordered it? What was its purpose? How many other N.Y.P.D.-associated groups have been investigated because they sometimes speak out against policies and practices it feels are wrong?''</p>
        <p>The group of black officers has frequently criticized the department, particularly its efforts to recruit minorities and discipline brutal officers.</p>
        <p>''I'm confused,'' Lieutenant Adams said. ''It is confusing to find out that there is an 11-month period of your life that was no longer yours. It was shared by an unwelcome guest.''</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Adams said he would ask the department to explain the basis for the investigations, which were disclosed in very general terms during the testimony Thursday by Chief King, who directs criminal investigations into police officers.</p>
        <p>Chief King's testimony came as part of a federal civil rights case filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan by a black officer who contends that she was fired after speaking out about racial profiling within the Street Crime Unit.</p>
        <p>In his testimony, the chief said the first investigation started in August 1998 and focused on Lieutenant Adams. Investigators assigned to that case spent about 11 months staking out locations, following people and reviewing phone records to ''establish an association between different individuals to see if they're talking on the phone,'' the chief said.</p>
        <p>Police officials would not clarify the nature of the investigation into Lieutenant Adams, except to say that it concerned conduct that was not related to his police work or his position as the head of the outside organization.</p>
        <p>Although he was not found to have engaged in any wrongdoing, Lieutenant Adams said he was still concerned about the investigation because he has aspired to be a model citizen, adding that he had been promoted from sergeant to lieutenant in the past two years.</p>
        <p>The second investigation began in March 1999 and lasted only a few months, focusing on ''vague allegations'' made against the law enforcement organization itself, Chief King said. Investigators did not conduct surveillance or obtain phone records for that inquiry, but they interviewed the people who had made the complaint, he testified.</p>
        <p>Police officials said the investigation stemmed from complaints by black officers that they had been harassed by Lieutenant Adams' group when they refused, in the aftermath of the Diallo shooting, to criticize the Street Crime Unit. The four officers who shot Mr. Diallo in February 1999 were members of the unit. Lieutenant Adams denied that his organization had ever been coercive.</p>
        <p>Neither of the investigations was public knowledge until Chief King testified in the lawsuit filed by Yvette Walton, a black officer who said she was fired last year in retaliation for criticizing the Police Department. Ms. Walton, wearing a hood to conceal her identity, spoke at a news conference with Lieutenant Adams and later appeared on television in silhouette. After she testified anonymously before the City Council, she was fired.</p>
        <p>Police officials have said Ms. Walton's dismissal was based on her record of lapses on the job and had been decided before her testimony. But Ms. Walton, who was a member of the Street Crime Unit, contends in her lawsuit that she was fired for saying that the unit had routinely engaged in racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer, Chris Dunn of the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked Chief King to discuss the Adams investigation during cross-examination in the case, as part of an apparent effort to establish that police officials have a record of sanctioning those who speak out against the department.</p>
