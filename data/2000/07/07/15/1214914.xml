        <p>She knelt down in her stiff new robe stitched with purple and gold brocade, surrounded by a tight circle of four bishops and five elders. One by one, they laid their hands on the crown of her head in a mighty stack, consecrating her the first woman bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>
        <p>''Pinch me,'' the Rev. Vashti Murphy McKenzie of Baltimore says she told herself. ''It's really happening, but it seems unreal. All I was saying was, 'Let's not cry now. Let's cry later. Don't cry here.' ''</p>
        <p>When she stood, she was dry-eyed, but many of the 5,000 or so church members watching at the convention center here were not. Men and women streamed down the aisles to get close enough to snap pictures of the new bishop, bathing her in a benediction of flashes.</p>
        <p>The laying on of hands happened at 1:02 a.m. on Wednesday after seven days of campaigning at the church's quadrennial convention. At 3:15 a.m., she was still in the convention center, meeting with the pastors and lay leaders from the district where she will serve her first four years: the 18th, which covers Mozambique, Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland.</p>
        <p>She plans to move to her district Africa with her husband, Stan McKenzie, a former National Basketball Association player.</p>
        <p>Many said the A.M.E. Church could not elect a woman as bishop because the churches in Africa -- home to about a third of the 2.5 million A.M.E. members -- were not ready to accept a woman's leadership. But Bishop McKenzie said that, to the contrary, some African delegates had asked her to come to their districts if she were elected. They told her they could use the experience she had gained in Baltimore developing programs to help the uneducated, unemployed, or those suffering from AIDS.</p>
        <p>''Instead of placing my gender in front of me, I'll place who I am and what I do, and who I serve in front of me,'' she said in an interview. ''They know I'm a woman when I walk in the door. So what. I've been one all my life. Get over it.''</p>
        <p>She is a fitting first. Tall and regal, her bearing recalls the runway modeling she did as a teenager. Professional and prepared, in her campaign for bishop she had the glossiest brochure of any of the 42 candidates, the brightest red T-shirts on her supporters and the slickest video promoting her accomplishments in 10 years as pastor at Payne Memorial A.M.E. in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''She is qualified to be bishop, forget the gender,'' said the Rev. Richard Greene, a pastor from Maryland who joined a huddle of 20 men in the convention center praying passionately for her victory minutes before the final vote. ''She cares about people, and finds the best in people. I am a country boy,'' and quite traditional, Mr. Greene said, ''but I believe in her. She has always been there for me.''</p>
        <p>As the reality of her purple and gold robe sank in, Bishop McKenzie, who said she is in her 50's, looked back over her life and said she ''realized that all of it was the preparation for this moment.''</p>
        <p>The ministry was not her first career. Initially, she went into journalism, the family business. Her great-grandfather, John H. Murphy Sr., had founded The Afro-American newspaper in 1892, when very few blacks were literate, she said. She honed her writing at The Arizona Republic and The Afro-American, which still publishes in Baltimore and Washington. She cultivated her speaking skills as a broadcaster on gospel radio.</p>
        <p>But when the first of her three children was born 25 years ago, she faced a crisis, she said. She had heard the call to ministry. She fasted. She prayed. And she said she resisted.</p>
        <p>''It can be a very frightening thing when all of a sudden you realize God is calling you to preach,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There were only one or two women she knew in ministry then, she said, and no books on how to do it. Few mentors. She went ahead and earned her master of divinity degree from Howard University School of Divinity in Washington and her doctorate of ministry from Union Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio. The first church she was assigned to had seven members.</p>
        <p>When the pastor of Payne Memorial died in 1989, church insiders buzzed about who would fill that prestigious pulpit. At a church gathering, Bishop H.H. Brookins called her aside and told her he wanted to assign her to Payne.</p>
        <p>She recalls that he asked her, '' 'Can you handle the pressure, because if you are not successful, it will be a long time before a woman will be given a major pulpit again.' I said I could.''</p>
        <p>Her church was the first in Maryland to join the welfare reform effort by winning a $1.5 million state contract to open a job training center, in 1997. The church's nonprofit affiliate took over a failing public school. It bought a five-story apartment building and an office building to house the church's youth and senior programs, computer classes and a catering service that employs former welfare recipients. The church grew to 1,700 members from 300.</p>
        <p>She says she follows the ''Ten Commandments for Women Leaders'' that she composed in her book ''Not Without a Struggle'' (United Church Press, 1996). The first commandment is: ''Thou shalt not forsake one's femininity for the sake of one's position.''</p>
        <p>''You see beautiful women stripping themselves of their femininity just to be able to hold a position of power,'' Bishop McKenzie said. ''I believe you don't have to give up your femininity. Esther may have been a good-looking woman and that may have gotten her an interview with the king, but it was her character that earned her the crown, and it was her relationship with God that saved her people.''</p>
        <p>Her very feminine approach to power was on display at the convention. She was campaigning when she found herself in a too-long embrace with a churchgoer who said he had heard her preach (she has topped Ebony Magazine's ''15 Greatest Female Preachers List'').</p>
        <p>''You came to see us, and I remember you,'' the man gushed, ''because you're so beautiful.''</p>
        <p>As he planted a sloppy kiss on her cheek, she never lost her composure.</p>
