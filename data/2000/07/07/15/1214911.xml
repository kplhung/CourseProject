        <p>THE MONEY RACE</p>
        <p>WELL SET TO ADVERTISE -- The Republican and Democratic national parties reported healthy bank balances on June 30 as they entered the final pre-election stretch. The Republican National Committee reported $53.4 million cash on hand after having raised $86.6 million since Jan. 1. The Democratic National Committee said it had $35 million in the bank; it has raised $64.4 million so far this year. The parties benefited from lucrative fund-raising dinners featuring their leaders. A dinner honoring Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in April brought in $21 million; a Democratic salute to President Clinton a month later yielded $27 million. Both parties said their June 30 figures were the largest ever at this stage of a campaign and promised to use their wealth to finance aggressive television advertising campaigns on behalf of their candidates and issues.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>ADS ATTACK BUSH ON ABORTION -- Planned Parenthood will run $2.5 million in television advertising to spotlight Gov. George W. Bush's anti-abortion views, hoping to reach independent and Republican women who support abortion rights. The group says its research suggests that many women respect Planned Parenthood but are leaning toward Mr. Bush. ''We're focusing on those 'compassionate conservative' Republican and independent women who are very pro-choice,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm. ''They believe us when we tell them about George W. Bush's position. These are the women who elected Bill Clinton twice.'' The first advertisement will run nationally on cable television, beginning on Monday and extending through the Republican National Convention, July 31 to Aug. 3.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>LEADING UP TO A FUND-RAISER -- The Democratic National Committee plans to cap the end of its national nominating convention in Los Angeles next month by raising $2 million for its candidates. The Republican National Committee is also planning a major fund-raiser near the end of its gathering in Philadelphia. All of the money raised at the Democratic fund-raiser will be spent on advertising and other activities urging voters to support Democratic candidates, from Vice President Al Gore on down. The Republican National Committee has not said how much it expects to raise at its event or how it will be spent. Tickets for the Republican event will start at $1,000.</p>
