        <p>Stanley M. Rosenblatt, the lawyer who won the biggest class-action lawsuit in history yesterday, is part of a husband-and-wife legal team that operates as lone eagles in the tobacco wars. They are not among the big-name plaintiffs' lawyers who sued the industry on behalf of the states and amassed hundreds of millions of dollars and great political power.</p>
        <p>But this is not the first time that Mr. Rosenblatt has scored big against the tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>''I'd be out of my mind if I was doing this for the money,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said in 1996, when his class-action lawsuits against tobacco companies were just beginning to seem dangerous to the industry.</p>
        <p>That was before he was awarded $49 million in fees in the tobacco industry's 1997 settlement with flight attendants, who claimed they were damaged by secondhand smoke. And that also was before yesterday, when he won what one tobacco attorney called a ''death warrant'' for the industry: a $144.8 billion damage award in a lawsuit brought by Florida smokers who blamed their illnesses on smoking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt's fee is yet to be determined by the court. He will submit his expenses, and ask the judge for a percentage of the award.</p>
        <p>The small -- some say aloof -- firm run by Mr. Rosenblatt and his wife, Susan, an appellate lawyer, has made its reputation by succeeding where polished celebrity lawyers have failed, and by being paid handsomely for it.</p>
        <p>Anti-tobacco activists criticized his fee in the flight attendant's lawsuit, particularly because the plaintiffs received nothing. Four of the largest tobacco companies agreed to spend $300 million researching smoking-related illnesses. But the plaintiffs retained the right to sue for individual damages.</p>
        <p>The $49 million fee was about 16 percent of the total settlement.</p>
        <p>After a federal appeals panel dismissed what would have been the largest class-action suit in history, brought against the tobacco industry by a consortium of some 60 lawyers in 1996, attention shifted to Mr. Rosenblatt's two suits, the flight attendant suit and the suit representing some 500,000 Florida smokers.</p>
        <p>''Now it's up to Ma and Pa Kettle,'' Mr. Rosenblatt said at the time.</p>
        <p>They have won several multimillion-dollar malpractice judgments in Florida, including a $6 million verdict on behalf of a motel guest who became a quadriplegic after diving off a pier and $3.8 million for the parents of a teenager who was killed when his motorcycle was hit by a car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt first encountered the effects of cigarettes in 1988, when he successfully defended a St. Petersburg, Fla., doctor who was accused of murder after he wrote about helping his wife die. The doctor's wife had been suffering from lung cancer.</p>
