        <p>KARSKI-Jan. The Board and staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research mourn the death of Prof. Jan Karski, heroic diplomatic envoy of the Polish governmentin-exile during World War II, eyewitness to the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazi extermination of Jews in Poland, and a ''Righteous Gentile.'' At great risk, he personally reported what he had seen of the Nazi annihilation of Polish Jews to Pres. Franklin Roosevelt. His was a life of courage, moral integrity and commitment to protecting, then preserving, the memory of the destroyed civilization of Polish Jewry. We are proud that he established the Jan Karski and Pola Nirenska Award at YIVO in 1993 to honor his late wife. A true friend, his actions in a time of world war were beyond courageous. He was an example to us all. We will miss this unique man. May his memory be a blessing. Bruce Slovin, Chairman Dr. Carl J. Rheins, Exec. Director</p>
        <p>KARSKI-Jan. The Anti-Defamation League mourns the passing of Jan Karski. Witness to the extermination of Polish Jews, Karski put himself at risk to make known the Nazi's final solution. He dedicated his life to preserving the memory of Holocaust victims, fighting anti-semitism and promoting tolerance. In 1988 ADL honored him with our Courage To Care Award. May his legacy be an inspiration to future generations. Howard P. Berkowitz, National Chairman Abraham H. Foxman, National Director</p>
