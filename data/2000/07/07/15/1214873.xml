        <p>Napster, the wildly popular software that allows users to trade music over the Internet, could be shut down later this month if the Recording Industry Association of America gets an injunction it is seeking in federal court in California. The big record companies in the association -- along with the angry artists who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week -- maintain that Napster is nothing more than a tool for digital piracy.</p>
        <p>But Napster and the MP3 technology it exploits have changed the music business no matter how the lawsuit comes out. Despite all the fuss about copyright and legality, the most important freedom Napster has spread across the music world is not freedom from cost, but freedom of choice.</p>
        <p>Napster, by linking music lovers and letting them share their collections, lets them select from a boundless range of music, one song at a time. This is a huge change from the way the music industry currently does business, and even if Napster Inc. disappears, it won't be easy to persuade customers to go back to getting their music as the music industry has long packaged it. Most albums have only two or three songs that any given listener likes, but the album format forces people to choose between paying for a dozen mediocre songs to get those two or three, or not getting any of the songs at all. This all-or-nothing approach has resulted in music collections that are the barest approximation of a listener's actual tastes. Even CD ''singles'' have been turned into multi-track mini-albums almost as expensive as the real thing, and though there have been some commercial ''mix your own CD'' experiments in recent years, they foundered because major labels wouldn't allow access to their collections a song at a time.</p>
        <p>Napster has demonstrated that there are no technological barriers to gaining access to the world's music catalogue, just commercial ones.</p>
        <p>Napster users aren't merely cherry-picking the hits off well-known albums. Listeners are indulging all their contradictory interests, constantly updating their playlists with a little Bach, a little Beck or a little Buckwheat Zydeco, as the mood strikes them. Because it knows nothing of genre, a Napster search produces a cornucopia of alternate versions: Hank Williams's ''I'm So Lonesome I Could Die'' as interpreted by both Dean Martin and the Cowboy Junkies, or two dozen covers of ''Louie Louie.''</p>
        <p>Napster has become a tool for musical adventure, producing more diversity by accident than the world music section of the local record store does by design: a simple search for the word ''water'' brings up Simon and Garfunkel's ''Bridge Over Troubled Water,'' Deep Purple's ''Smoke on the Water,'' ''Cool Water'' by the Sons of the Pioneers and ''Water No Get Enemy'' by Fela Anikulapo Kuti. After experiencing this freedom, music lovers are not going to go happily back to buying albums.</p>
        <p>The question remains of how artists will be paid when songs are  downloaded over the Internet, and there are many sources of revenue being bandied about -- advertising, sponsorship, user subscription, pay-per-song. But merely recreating the CD in cyberspace will not work.</p>
        <p>In an echo of Prohibition, Napster users have shown that they are willing to break the law to escape the constraints of all-or-nothing musical choices. This won't be changed by shutting down Napster. The music industry is going to have to find some way to indulge its customers in their newfound freedom.</p>
