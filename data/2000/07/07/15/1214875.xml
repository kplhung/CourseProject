        <p>What would the music sound like if the Pied Piper of fairy tale fame led a punk band? One answer wafted through the air Tuesday at a packed Irving Plaza as Sunny Day Real Estate played for an enthralled, mostly college-age crowd. The Seattle band, touring in support of its stately new album, ''The Rising Tide'' (Timebomb Recordings), proved that young fans can be transported by artists dedicated to beauty instead of controversy or cash.</p>
        <p>Sunny Day Real Estate is unobtrusively legendary among fans of emocore, a subgenre mixing aggressive guitar bashing with swooping melodies and romantic lyrics. The band has a complicated history, interrupted by the singer Jeremy Enigk's midcareer conversion to Christianity and the rhythm section's defection to the more mainstream Foo Fighters. The group eventually reunited and, with a new bassist, now seems solidly grounded in a sound that updates progressive rock by giving it a punk edge.</p>

        <p>What would the music sound like if the Pied Piper of fairy tale fame led a punk band? One answer wafted through the air Tuesday at a packed Irving Plaza as Sunny Day Real Estate played for an enthralled, mostly college-age crowd. The Seattle band, touring in support of its stately new album, ''The Rising Tide'' (Timebomb Recordings), proved that young fans can be transported by artists dedicated to beauty instead of controversy or cash.</p>
        <p>Sunny Day Real Estate is unobtrusively legendary among fans of emocore, a subgenre mixing aggressive guitar bashing with swooping melodies and romantic lyrics. The band has a complicated history, interrupted by the singer Jeremy Enigk's midcareer conversion to Christianity and the rhythm section's defection to the more mainstream Foo Fighters. The group eventually reunited and, with a new bassist, now seems solidly grounded in a sound that updates progressive rock by giving it a punk edge.</p>
        <p>The group doled out musical ecstasy at Irving Plaza, building wave upon wave of sustained guitar, keyboards and fluttering vocals over William Goldsmith's solid bed of drums. Listeners suspicious of melodrama might find Sunny Day's open sound garish. Its connection to other recent spiritual strivers in rock, especially U2, was clear, as was its debt to cape-wearing art rockers like Yes. But Dan Hoerner and Mr. Enigk scraped grit from their guitars in choruses that blew away the fog of their songs' quieter passages.</p>
        <p>The effect of this changing storm, which also recalls the soft-hard song structures of Nirvana, was mesmerizing for anyone willing to submerge within it. Aided by the touring keyboardist and guitarist Greg Suran and the bassist Nicholas Macri, Sunny Day reproduced the big, watery flow of its recordings. Tricky lyrics about mystical longing and earthly frustration, which are so personal that they're sometimes rendered in a language invented by the band, gained breadth within the magnanimous sound.</p>
        <p>Tapping into the spirit in a most physical way, through noise and raw emotiveness, Sunny Day Real Estate is moving forward rock's long history of spiritual exploration. This strain of pop rarely becomes as fashionable as the music's earthier aspects. Secularists who consider it pretentious scorn it. But young listeners always find it, as they face blossoming feelings within their souls as well as their bodies. Those seekers need bands like Sunny Day Real Estate, to offer enchantment anew.</p>
