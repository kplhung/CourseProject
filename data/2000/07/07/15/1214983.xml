        <p>Preston Wilson flung both hands into the air, raised onto his toes and jumped back from a fastball thrown by Roger Clemens in the first inning last night, and there must have been a sense of relief in the Yankees' dugout.</p>
        <p>It was Clemens's first start since he beaned the Mets' Mike Piazza and was accused of doing so intentionally, and some of his teammates -- Manager Joe Torre among them -- were not sure how he would react, if Clemens would become tentative, for fear that he might hit somebody again and raise more allegations.</p>
        <p>But Clemens brushed back Wilson in the first inning, pitched inside a few more times and pitched effectively, allowing only two runs over seven innings and earning his third victory in his last three starts as the Yankees dumped the Florida Marlins, 6-2, before 35,332 fans at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''He threw a few inside,'' Torre said. ''I'm not sure he was as aggressive as he was, or wanted to be.''</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams and David Justice slammed back-to-back home runs in the first inning, and in the fourth, Ryan Thompson ripped a three-run homer, extending his audition to become the Yankees' regular left fielder, at least for another day or two.</p>
        <p>Clemens strolled into the Yankees' clubhouse about two hours before last night's game wearing black slacks, one of his primary wardrobe colors, with a Western-style belt, a dark blue shirt and a beard one or two days old, a major league pitcher disguised as John Wayne. He is not the type to reveal his feelings.</p>
        <p>But Torre indicated obliquely that he sensed Clemens was hurt by the fallout of the pitch he threw to Piazza -- the direct accusations made by Piazza and some of the other Mets, as well as some reporters.</p>
        <p>In the midst of the furor, on Sunday night at Shea Stadium, Torre saw Clemens sitting in the Yankees' training room and asked him how he was holding up, and Clemens answered that he was O.K.</p>
        <p>Still, there was no way of knowing how Clemens would react until he pitched again. Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre had encouraged him for more than a year, since he joined the Yankees, to be more aggressive pitching inside, and Clemens had done so in his first two starts in July and won.</p>
        <p>That was before the Piazza fallout, though. Clemens went to the bullpen about 15 minutes sooner than he normally does, before pitching against the Marlins last night -- he was anxious, Torre thought -- and immediately was in trouble. The Marlins had a runner at second and Clemens needed 10 pitches to strike out Cliff Floyd. Wilson, who had a couple of hits Thursday, leaned across the plate on a 1-1 pitch, and then Clemens threw inside, driving Wilson back. It was a good sign.</p>
        <p>Clemens needed 33 pitches to get through the first inning, but after the Yankees scored three runs in the bottom of the first, he could be more aggressive with his fastball -- ''more efficient,'' he called it. The Marlins scored twice in the third, when Wilson drove a low fastball to the opposite field, to the right-field stands, but Thompson hammered a hanging slider from Florida's Ryan Dempster (9-6) for a three-run shot in the fourth. Clemens was more comfortable thereafter, his fastball consistently reaching 95 miles an hour, and he shut out the Marlins in his last four innings.</p>
        <p>His beard had been shaved into a goatee after the game, the same hard face. But Clemens's voice seemed to sink a bit when asked about the reaction to Piazza's beaning. Clemens reiterated that he would never say exactly what his plan was in pitching to Piazza that night, but he indicated that he did have a plan -- to pitch inside, surely -- that went awry. Others in the organization believe Clemens meant to knock down Piazza, who had 7 hits in 12 at-bats against Clemens, but not hurt him.</p>
        <p>''I felt awful about it when everything went down,'' Clemens said last night. ''I'm not going to tell you how I'm going to pitch to you or try to get him out, but obviously with the game plan, we had to do something different. But it obviously wasn't to that extreme. It looked awful.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said he was told about the adverse reaction from family and friends.</p>
        <p>''I think it bothered them as much, because they know me personally as an individual,'' he said. ''Some guys that don't know me write about it, and portray you in the media as someone you're not when they don't really know me personally.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said the only reactions he really cares about are in this clubhouse. He added: ''Each man, to a man, said 'We've got your back and continue to be aggressive and do what you have to do.' It's great to hear.''</p>
        <p>For his teammates, it was great to see him pitching inside again.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets changed plans after the MIKE PIAZZA beaning to prevent their All-Stars, AL LEITER and EDGARDO ALFONZO, from flying with the Yankees' All-Stars to Atlanta on Sunday. Interestingly, however, one of the Mets -- center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON -- flew to Texas on a plane chartered by ROGER CLEMENS. . . . DREW HENSON, the primary prospect in the package sent to Cincinnati for DENNY NEAGLE, has suggested he might play football professionally, rather than baseball. ''Go, football,'' said BRIAN CASHMAN, the Yankees' general manager. ''I'm a big University of Michigan fan.'' If Henson decides to play football, of course, then the Yankees' trade looks better and the chance of Henson turning into a baseball star -- and making the Yankees look bad -- is eliminated.</p>
