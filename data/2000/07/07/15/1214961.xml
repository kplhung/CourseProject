        <p>Bowing to the competitive pressures sweeping across Europe, Germany's left-of-center Parliament passed a radical tax program today that will slash rates and should also unleash a wave of restructuring in ''Germany Inc.''</p>
        <p>The vote was a remarkable and unexpected victory for Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic leader who began his career as a longhaired student protester but whose tax plan made him a hero of the corporate elite.</p>
        <p>In a role reversal worthy of Lewis Carroll, Mr. Schroder received extensive lobbying support from German corporations, as well as from American businesses here, and overwhelmed the usually pro-business party, the Christian Democratic Union. That party fought the bill for political reasons, and criticized it as too limited.</p>
        <p>By 2005, the law will reduce crushing tax rates for individuals and corporations by a total of 50 billion marks, or $24 billion a year. The top tax rates for individuals will drop, to 42 percent, from 51, and the overall corporate burden is expected to decline to 40 percent, from 50.</p>
        <p>The most striking change, however, is a provision that will let corporations sell subsidiaries or shares in other companies without paying any tax on their profits. That change is expected to revolutionize the structure of German business, because it clears the way for the big banks and insurance companies to sell more than $100 billion in shares of industrial companies like DaimlerChrysler and Siemens.</p>
        <p>Under the old structure of ''Germany Inc.,'' those cross holdings created a web of mutual support that helped finance a spectacular economic recovery after World War II. But now, with companies dependent on satisfying the performance demands set by investors on Wall Street or in London, banks and manufacturers argue that the tangled ownership has become an obstacle to restructuring and a drag on profits.</p>
        <p>Selling the stakes has been almost impossible under the law, because selling companies are charged a 50-percent tax on tens of billions of dollars of profit from shares that they may have held for decades.</p>
        <p>Economists and corporate executives say the combined effects of the changes will be to transform Germany, Europe's biggest economy but one that has been growing slowly. Some changes will begin next year.</p>
        <p>Elga Bartsch, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, estimated that the law would increase German growth next year, to 3.1 percent from 2.6. Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche Bank, predicted that growth would exceed that.</p>
        <p>''It is a very important signal to investors, because here you have a government of Social Democrats and Greens that has passed a very business-oriented tax reform,'' Mr. Walter said today. The pro-business political trend is apparent across Europe, he added, even where left-of-center parties control the biggest countries.</p>
        <p>''The euro is the catalyst,'' Mr. Walter said, referring to the single currency that 12 countries have adopted. ''It is the catalytic effect of a truly internal market that has now pushed the laggards toward the more advanced countries in terms of modernization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder came into office two years ago dependent politically on the left-wing leader of his party, Oskar Lafontaine. But since the two men had a falling out a year ago, Mr. Schroder has steered his party in a more pro-business direction.</p>
        <p>As recently as Wednesday, most experts were convinced that Mr. Schroder would be blocked in the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, by the Christian Democrats. But Mr. Schroder steamrollered over both Christian Democrats on the right and disgruntled left-wing traditionalists in his own party, showing a self-assurance and a readiness for conflict that was missing when he came to power.</p>
        <p>The Christian Democrats argued that the plan failed to provide enough relief to small and medium-size companies. But their primary goal seemed to be to stymie Mr. Schroder, whose Social Democrats blocked a Christian Democratic tax plan three years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder lashed back by promising more than $1 billion in sweeteners to small companies, as well as to states where political leaders were wavering. He persuaded the Christian Democratic leader of Berlin to defect to his side, by promising $36 million for additional police officers and $12 million to renovate Museum Island. And he got leaders from Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the impoverished eastern state, to go along by cutting a deal with state's neo-Communist Party of Democratic Socialism.</p>
        <p>That party, successor to the old East German Communist Party, is a minority partner of the state's governing coalition and normally no friend of corporate Germany. But Mr. Schroder received the party's support after he had promised to support building a highly subsidized power plant in the state. Opponents protested fruitlessly that Mr. Schroder was using government money to buy votes.</p>
        <p>''I have not experienced this sort of abuse of a constitutional branch of government in 30 years,'' thundered Gov. Hans Jochen Vogel of Thuringia, a Christian Democrat.</p>
        <p>But Angela Merkel, chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Union, seemed cowed. ''When it came to the process,'' Ms. Merkel said today at a news conference, ''Mr. Schroder was clearly the winner. Maintaining unity proved to be much thornier and more difficult than many people had thought.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schroder, grinning broadly after the vote, brushed aside the criticism as ''hypocrisy'' and said the plan would be good for business, as well as for individuals, by leaving them additional money in their pockets. ''This is truly a good day for Germany,'' the chancellor said.</p>
        <p>Investors generally agreed. The DAX index of blue-chip German stocks jumped 2 percent after the vote, and financial institutions ended considerably higher. Shares of Allianz, the insurance conglomerate that is perhaps at the center of German cross holdings, jumped 7 percent, to 395.65 euros. Shares of Dresdner Bank jumped 5.6 percent and Deutsche Bank rose 3.36.</p>
        <p>But economists also said the law's ultimate effects could reach well beyond Germany. Foreign investors, including many corporate buyout funds from the United States, are scouring Germany for companies to buy, spruce up and sell for a profit years later.</p>
        <p>Merger and acquisition activity, already torrid, is widely expected to soar as the provision on selling corporate holdings takes effect in 2002.</p>
        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group, which has been an adviser in many of Germany's biggest mergers, is hiring hundreds of executives and leasing 11 added floors in one of Frankfurt's biggest skyscrapers.</p>
        <p>American companies were unusually active in lobbying for the bill. Representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, based in Frankfurt, visited officials from several German states that were wavering in their support.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing is the signal we get from Germany,'' said Norbert Quinkert, executive vice president of the chamber and chairman of Motorola Deutschland. ''It wasn't important whether the top tax rate was 42 percent or 43 percent. The issue was whether a tax reform could be passed.''</p>
