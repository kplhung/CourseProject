        <p>The dancers of the Martha Graham Dance Company are urging a boycott of Graham's works after the closing of the virtually bankrupt Graham company and school by the board on May 25 and amid the continuing discord between the board and Ron Protas, its former artistic director and Graham's heir. Mr. Protas owns the dances and directs the Martha Graham Trust, which licenses the dances.</p>
        <p>The Graham performers began a nationwide mailing last week with the help of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the dancers' union.</p>
        <p>''To preserve the integrity of Martha Graham's work until the Martha Graham Center can be revived,'' the dancers have written, ''we ask all other dance companies and institutions to refrain from licensing and performing any Graham work. We ask all artists to refrain from participating in the mounting of any Graham work. We ask all dancers to refrain from accepting engagements to perform any Graham work.''</p>
        <p>The letter has been signed by 23 Graham dancers; 54 former company members; and 500 ''artists and colleagues.''</p>
        <p>With the Graham company inactive, the only scheduled productions of Graham dances are by the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and the Ballet of the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro, and neither has announced cancellation. In the belief that the Graham company sets the standard for performances of her choreography, the dancers say, they are urging Mr. Protas and the board to restructure their relationship, with Mr. Protas negotiating a licensing agreement that would give the center more autonomy.</p>
        <p>''They have badly managed the autonomy they've been given,'' Mr. Protas said in an interview this week. ''Why would one want to give them more, managerially and artistically?''</p>
        <p>Michael Quinn, the lawyer representing Mr. Protas and the trust, said that those who claim to be a showcase for Graham's choreography and technique ''have to be willing to have the quality of their performing and operations supervised by the owner of the trademark.''</p>
        <p>Describing the center as the heart of Graham's philosophy and technique and necessary for maintaining quality in revivals of her works, the dancers also talked about the loss of important Graham dancers and teachers over the years because of discord at the center, which is operating out of temporary offices at the Citicorp Center. ''People who have given the most and have the most to give have given up,'' Christine Dakin, another Graham principal, said. ''We hope to correct this situation.''</p>
        <p>Terese Capucilli, a leading Graham dancer, said that 16 of the company's 17 core dancers helped write the letter. One dancer is out of town, she said.</p>
        <p>Signers of the dancers' letter include Ella Baff, director of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival; Benjamin Harkarvy, director of dance at the Juilliard School; the actress Claire Bloom; Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater; and the choreographers Lucinda Childs and Bill T. Jones.</p>
        <p>Among those who declined to sign the petition was Charles Reinhart, a director of the American Dance Festival. ''If they really want to resolve the situation, they would push for private talks outside the eye of the media in an attempt to soothe this extremely inflamed situation,'' Mr. Reinhart said of the letter.</p>
        <p>Cross-Fertilization in Dance</p>
        <p>An international conference called Dancing in the Millennium, which opens on Wednesday in Washington, will bring together hundreds dancers, scholars, teachers, writers and producers.</p>
        <p>Some 20 dance organizations and 500 participants from Europe, Asia, Israel and the United States will converge on the nation's capital to attend a wide variety of workshops and performances at the Kennedy Center, the Duke Ellington School of the Arts and outdoors at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt monument. Workshop and discussion themes include digitizing dance, preservation, the sampling of dance idioms and body type, age and mobility in dance performing. Subjects range from Bela Lugosi to Lincoln Kirstein and from Jean Cocteau to Twyla Tharp, with Martha Graham and George Balanchine thrown in for good measure. (Information: (301) 657-2883, or at www.artsnet.org/dance2000.)  ''What we're doing here is a lot of cross-fertilization,'' said Dawn Lille Horwitz, a chairwoman of the conference steering committee. ''There are so many areas of dance in which people rarely talk to each other. With some exceptions, nobody goes to another's conference. Here everyone can talk to each other, and we hope they continue to work together.''</p>
        <p>The emphasis will be on money for the arts and dance education. On Wednesday morning advocates for dance, among them the performer and educator Carmen de Lavallade and the choreographer Donald Byrd, will lobby Congress and others on the importance of dance. Ms. de Lavallade and the others will mention that the nonprofit arts industry generates $36.8 billion annually in economic activity, returning $3.4 billion to the federal government in taxes.</p>
        <p>They will talk about the fast-growing cultural tourism market in America and the finding by a recent Louis Harris poll that 56 percent of Americans would pay $10 or more in taxes for the arts.</p>
        <p>Ms. de Lavallade also intends to make the point that dancing is healthy for everyone from teenagers to politicians. ''If the people in the Washington world would pull down their shades at night, turn on their radio and dance out their frustrations,'' she said, ''I think they'd do much better the next day. I've seen it work.''</p>
