        <p>FRIEDMAN-Shirley. 78, Died unexpectedly on July 14, 2000 in Westfield, New Jersey. Beloved wife of Charles Friedman for fiftyseven plus years, adored mother of Steven and David Friedman, loving mother-in-law of Pamela Boord, cherished sister of Gloria Winter and proud aunt of Seth and Susan Winter and their children Jesse, Jamie and Max.

Contributions may be made to Masonic Camp Seven, 71 W. 23rd St., NY, NY, 10010, or to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, 165 West 46th Street, NY, NY 10036.</p>
