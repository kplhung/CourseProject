        <p>The tobacco industry may be forever changed by a Florida jury's stunning award of $145 billion in punitive damages in a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of injured smokers in Florida. The process of appeals on every aspect of this case will likely continue for years, making it hard to predict how much of the award will ultimately stand. But there is no doubt that this case poses a serious threat to the survival of the cigarette business.</p>
        <p>The sheer size of the award is an important symbol. The industry, which for so long had been able to escape liability for individual deaths and illnesses, is now facing a sea change in public attitudes -- and the attitudes of future juries -- about its responsibility for selling products that cause death and disease.</p>

        <p>The tobacco industry may be forever changed by a Florida jury's stunning award of $145 billion in punitive damages in a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of injured smokers in Florida. The process of appeals on every aspect of this case will likely continue for years, making it hard to predict how much of the award will ultimately stand. But there is no doubt that this case poses a serious threat to the survival of the cigarette business.</p>
        <p>The sheer size of the award is an important symbol. The industry, which for so long had been able to escape liability for individual deaths and illnesses, is now facing a sea change in public attitudes -- and the attitudes of future juries -- about its responsibility for selling products that cause death and disease.</p>
        <p>Under Florida law, a punitive damages award cannot drive a defendant into bankruptcy. The industry is challenging the appropriateness of allowing a plaintiff class that could cover more than 500,000 Florida residents. Other questions are also unresolved. For example, the punitive damages are awarded to the entire class, but it is unclear how such an award would be divided among the unidentified class members, who would each still have to show that his or her particular injuries came from cigarettes.</p>
        <p>But even though the individual class members have yet to prove their cases and many procedural issues will be reviewed by higher courts, the six-member Florida jury has now found that the industry committed fraud on the public, conspired to conceal the dangers of smoking and placed on the market a product that was ''defective and unreasonably dangerous.'' This spring, in the second phase of the trial, the jury awarded nearly $13 million in compensatory damages to three plaintiffs who had contracted lung or throat cancer as a result of smoking. Now it has found that the industry must be punished and deterred from further wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>For years, tobacco firms were able to beat such lawsuits by blaming the smoker for not quitting. But that strategy did not work with this jury when it was confronted with thousands of internal industry documents showing that the companies had known for decades that smoking causes disease and is addictive, and yet mounted public campaigns to cast doubt on the scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>The tobacco firms tried to argue that punitive damages were unnecessary because the industry has changed its conduct when it made a $246 billion settlement with the states. The jury, reaching its decision in only five hours, was not convinced. A California jury also rejected that argument when it awarded a smoker with terminal cancer $20 million in punitive damages in March. In the end, these juries simply refused to let the industry get away with decades of lying about a product that causes more than 400,000 deaths in America a year.</p>
