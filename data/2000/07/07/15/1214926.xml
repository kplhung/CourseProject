        <p>Some returned from beach houses; others took the day off from their summer jobs. Hundreds of students came back from summer vacation to Chaminade High School today for a tearful last farewell to a classmate and a teacher who died on a school trip last Saturday when their van crashed in the Arizona desert.</p>
        <p>Fellow students in blue blazers and khakis served as pallbearers for Brendan Tracey, 16, who would have been a junior in September. Teachers in somber black suits carried the coffin of Brother Lawrence Zarzycki, 38, who graduated from the all-boys Roman Catholic school in 1980 and returned four years later to teach mathematics.</p>
        <p>Both died on their way to the Grand Canyon during a three-week school trip called the U.S.A. Tour. Their van, which was driven by Brother Zarzycki, flipped over and Brendan, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown out. Nine other passengers were injured in the crash, which officials said might have been caused by driver fatigue.</p>
        <p>The summer trips were rites of passage for Chaminade students, and Brendan had looked forward to his turn for years. The Rev. James C. Williams, the school's president, recalled in his homily a prayer Brendan wrote in May about the trip.</p>
        <p>''Holy Father, help me to bring life to the U.S.A. Tour this summer,'' Brendan wrote. ''Let me be a source of life to others on the trip who need me.''</p>
        <p>Father Williams recalled the charity work that Brother Zarzycki and Brendan had done. ''When the food drive came,'' he recalled, ''it was coordinated by Brother Lawrence for the whole school, and Brendan ran our homeroom effort.''</p>
        <p>More than a thousand people attended the funeral, and as they entered the school they passed a wide glass case in the lobby where a few prized possessions of both the teacher and the student were displayed.</p>
        <p>There was the guitar Brother Zarzycki played at Mass, his collection of theological books, canned food to represent the food drives he spearheaded, and one of his favorite albums, ''Close to You,'' by the Carpenters.</p>
        <p>There was a copy of the school's yearbook, Crimson and Gold, which Brendan helped edit, the championship plaque of the volleyball team on which he played, the fishing rods he used on family trips to New England, and a family crest he designed when he was younger. It included a baseball, a Yankees logo, a Polish flag over an Irish flag, and the motto: ''Can't win if you don't try.''</p>
        <p>In the center of the case were souvenirs of the trip out West: a U.S.A. Tour brochure, postcards from sites along the way, maps of national parks, and a picture of Brother Zarzycki, Brendan, and their fellow travelers in front of their large white van.</p>
