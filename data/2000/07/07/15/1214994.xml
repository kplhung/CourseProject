        <p>The United States track and field trials are often called the world's greatest track meet, but they are also the harshest. The first big shock of the trials occurred on the opening night when Jeff Hartwig, the American record-holder in the pole vault and an Olympic gold-medal candidate, failed to clear a height in the qualifying round.</p>
        <p>A month ago, Hartwig set the American record of 19 feet 9 1/2 inches, but tonight he bailed out on all three attempts at 18-2. He said that he had trouble with his contact lenses and was having a problem with depth perception as he made his run toward the bar.</p>

        <p>The United States track and field trials are often called the world's greatest track meet, but they are also the harshest. The first big shock of the trials occurred on the opening night when Jeff Hartwig, the American record-holder in the pole vault and an Olympic gold-medal candidate, failed to clear a height in the qualifying round.</p>
        <p>A month ago, Hartwig set the American record of 19 feet 9 1/2 inches, but tonight he bailed out on all three attempts at 18-2. He said that he had trouble with his contact lenses and was having a problem with depth perception as he made his run toward the bar.</p>
        <p>Unlike many other countries, where the top stars are granted automatic entry into the Olympics, the United States requires its athletes to finish in the top three at the trials. Because he went out during qualifying, Hartwig will not be eligible for the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>His stunning lapse was reminiscent of what happened to Dan O'Brien, who failed to clear a height in the decathlon pole vault at the 1992 trials and lost his eligibility for the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
        <p>''I just don't have the words to describe how disappointed I am,'' said Hartwig, who has come to be known for his vast collection of snakes as well as his vaulting prowess.</p>
        <p>''It's a brutal system we have. For many guys, this is the Olympic Games.''</p>
        <p>The first final at the trials tonight produced a riveting finish in the men's 10,000-meter race. Mebrahtom Keflezighi, a naturalized citizen from Eritrea who attended U.C.L.A., held off a charging Alan Culpepper at the wire to win in 28 minutes 3.32 seconds.</p>
        <p>Keflezighi broke the race open about halfway through, while Culpepper hung back. Culpepper made a final frantic rush in the home stretch and leaned at the tape but finished three-hundredths of a second behind in 28:03.35.</p>
        <p>In the pole vault, Hartwig passed at the opening height of 17-10, then could not find his form on any of his attempts at 18-2, pulling out of each attempt.</p>
        <p>He said that he had lost his technique after setting the American record in June, but thought he had recovered it.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was ready to go, but I fell apart,'' he said. ''I had a problem with my contacts, seeing the box. I couldn't get down the runway three times the same way.''</p>
