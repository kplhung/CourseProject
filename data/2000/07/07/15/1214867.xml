        <p>Do you ever, in the middle of the bidding, find yourself hating a partner to whom you are closely bonded? It happens rarely, but did on the diagramed deal from the semifinal of the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in Cincinnati. (If something seems wrong with the diagram, read on.)</p>

        <p>Do you ever, in the middle of the bidding, find yourself hating a partner to whom you are closely bonded? It happens rarely, but did on the diagramed deal from the semifinal of the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in Cincinnati. (If something seems wrong with the diagram, read on.)</p>
        <p>That is entirely understandable if your partner has plunged into a probable disaster and the fates have decreed that you are about to play the hand in his long suit when you have a void. But it is just possible that you can effect a transfer, relax as dummy and let him suffer.</p>
        <p>North and South were Steve Weinstein and Bob Levin, who came within a hair of winning the title as part of the Richard Schwartz team. After his opponents had bid the black suits, South intervened with a natural one no-trump bid.</p>
        <p>The partnership was using ''system on,'' which means that whenever its first bid is one no-trump, responses are the same as over an opening bid of one no-trump. So two clubs was Stayman, asking for a four-card major, and North was happy, planning to pass any response.</p>
        <p>Two diamonds doubled would have been tricky, but would probably have gone down one. North was horrified when his partner retreated to two no-trump, which was doubled; horror turned to hatred when South then tried three clubs, also doubled. Even worse, the Stayman bid meant that Weinstein was declarer.</p>
        <p>Luckily for him, West knew South held long clubs and forgot about the Stayman bid. He led his singleton spade jack and Weinstein was delighted to spread his hand as dummy, a move the laws sanction. Let Levin suffer, he thought. He had achieved a rare transfer.</p>
        <p>East won the first trick with the spade ace and led the heart nine. South won with the ace and returned the ten. West put up the king and played a third heart to the queen, on which South threw the spade ten rather than the obvious diamond.</p>
        <p>A spade lead to the king was ruffed by West, who tried his last heart. East contributed the club seven, hoping to promote something in his partner's hand. South overruffed with the eight and led the club jack. West's queen won in this position:</p>
        <p>[Diagram]</p>
        <p>West led the diamond two, and South, recalling the double of two no-trump, guessed right by playing the ten. He took two diamond tricks and endplayed West in trumps to escape for down two, 500 points. A trump lead in the diagramed situation would have led to the same result.</p>
        <p>North's hatred of his partner was now diminished, and disappeared when he found that his teammates had collected 800 against the same  contract, for a gain of 7 imps.</p>
