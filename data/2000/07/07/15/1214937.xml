        <p>Count on it: The Religious Right will be back. In about two weeks, the Republican National Convention will anoint George W.

        <p>Count on it: The Religious Right will be back. In about two weeks, the Republican National Convention will anoint George W. Bush's choice of a running mate, and depending on that choice, conservative religious leaders will be featured in the news, either voicing praise and support or expressing disappointment and opposition.</p>
        <p>But how closely do those leaders' views, often partisan and sometimes downright inflammatory, correspond to the outlook of the nation's conservative Christians? A considerable body of critical opinion, no less inflammatory itself, has assumed that the correspondence is close. As Pat Robertson or James Dobson goes, so go the evangelicals.</p>
        <p>Military metaphors abound in commentary on the Religious Right. Not just the prominent leaders and their organized cadres but the mass of conservative believers are often portrayed as an angry army on the march, legions of intolerant zealots eager to use governmental power to impose their favored moral order on the nation.</p>
        <p>Christian Smith, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, is blunt about such sweeping portraits. ''Most of those who disparage evangelicals in general terms really don't know what they are talking about,'' he writes in his latest book, ''Christian America? What Evangelicals Really Want'' (University of California, 2000).</p>
        <p>Few critics, Professor Smith says, ''have significant personal relationships with enough ordinary evangelicals to inform their views.'' Typically, the critics' views spring from characterizations in news articles and popular entertainment, from hoary mythology of the Elmer Gantry sort, from the newsletters and fund-raising appeals of organizations engaged in today's cultural wars or, lastly, from the impressions of people just like themselves.</p>
        <p>In Professor Smith's previous book, ''American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving'' (University of Chicago, 1998), his extensive polling and interviews challenged the widespread stereotype that evangelicalism only flourished in intellectual and economic backwaters, isolated enclaves guarded from what Walter Lippmann famously called the ''acids of modernity.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Professor Smith found that by most standards, measuring contact with this elusive thing called modernity -- years of higher education, employment patterns, income levels, urban versus rural residence, age or sex -- people who identified themselves as evangelical Christians scarcely differed from other Americans.</p>
        <p>His new book is based on a three-year national study involving more than 200 extended interviews, as well as polling data. He quickly identifies four fallacies that have distorted many descriptions of evangelicals: that their views can be equated with those of a supposedly united evangelical political elite; that their views are accurately represented by the formulations used in public opinion polling; that their views are ideologically consistent, and that they form a monolithic religious bloc rather than a conglomeration of often bickering subgroups.</p>
        <p>In his own interviews, Professor Smith did not shy from the hot-button questions. Did evangelicals want to restore a ''Christian America?'' What did they think of moral and cultural diversity? Did they have a duty to save neighbors of other faiths from hell? What could and could not -- or should not -- be attempted through politics? What should be the content of public education in a pluralist society? What about male leadership in the family and equality between men and women?</p>
        <p>On all of these questions he found a range of views, including extreme ones. That, in fact, was his first important discovery: that evangelicals were not united or monolithic.</p>
        <p>Still, Professor Smith found the bulk of evangelicals grouped around certain convictions.</p>
        <p>They were deeply committed to freedom of religion and speech, not simply as a matter of unavoidable compromise, but as a matter of their religious beliefs.</p>
        <p>They believed strongly in individual change, personal conversion of the heart, and consequently they remained wary of social movements, political involvement and institutional reforms.</p>
        <p>Far more than politics, they stressed personal example and loving gestures, including prayer, as a means to change.</p>
        <p>They frequently disagreed with the positions of their most visible political leaders and often said so quite explicitly.</p>
        <p>They were critical of their own failures to live up to the Gospel.</p>
        <p>These views were typically conveyed in rambling statements, not particularly eloquent, circling around in second thoughts and near contradictions, statements too long and too loose-jointed to serve reporters in need of the pebble-hard sound-bite, but statements with the authentic ring of ordinary people reflecting and not leaders posturing.</p>
        <p>Here is a woman, 54 years old, Midwestern and middle-class, who thinks that gays, the National Organization of Women and the news media are all hostile to Christianity, and who once marched outside an abortion clinic. But she has ''mixed feelings,'' she says, about the ''back-and-forth yelling thing'' and says ''one-on-one evangelism'' is ''far better than this group stuff where you're so militant and radical.''</p>
        <p>''I really frown on evangelicals that are kind of hostile themselves,'' she says. ''You don't win people that way. You've got to love them first. We should just stand firm in our beliefs, of course, but try to reach them in a loving way, try to talk to them and befriend them, rather than go and just start yelling things back and forth. What does that accomplish?''</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in what you call 'hard-sell' Christianity,'' she says, with much elaboration. ''I don't believe in preaching at people. I invite them to Christian things, and if the conversation can be such that I can talk to them about Jesus, I do that. I never hit anyone over the head with the Bible.''</p>
        <p>American evangelicals ''are neither angels nor demons,'' Professor Smith concludes. ''They are much too diverse, complex, ambivalent and inconsistent for that.'' Most are not particularly interested in waging the culture wars. They are neither apostles of multicultural diversity nor shock troops of intolerance. They are susceptible to demagogy but also resistant to it, in much the same ways as other Americans.</p>
        <p>The oratory surrounding political conventions sometimes leaves the impression of a citizenry divided into alien species. Professor Smith's book argues that it just isn't so.</p>
