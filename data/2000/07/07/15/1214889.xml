        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The photograph of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey frisking a suspected criminal is unfortunate (front page, July 11), but it is by no means an accurate portrayal of her behavior toward minority groups.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mrs. Whitman has included qualified minority-group members in her cabinet. As someone actively involved with the work of the Community Foundation of New Jersey, she has tried to bring new community-development programs to urban areas of New Jersey. She  has also worked with the Neighborhood Leadership Initiative, a program she helped create that is intended to identify and train minority-group members who have had some leadership experience in their own communities.</p>

        <p>Over all, she has done a great deal to promote better conditions and greater opportunities for minority groups throughout the state. This should be borne in mind when considering the implications of the photograph.</p>
