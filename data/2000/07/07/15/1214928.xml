        <p>On the morning after the collapse of an architectural salvage shop in the East Village forced the evacuation of more than 100 people from  three nearby buildings, residents of one of them learned it would still be days before they could return home.</p>
        <p>City officials continued to investigate the collapse on Thursday afternoon of the salvage store, Irreplaceable Artifacts, and defended their decision to order the demolition of the building with its remaining contents, estimated by its owner to be worth millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>By afternoon, the building that housed the relics that included cast-iron fireplaces, Victorian bathtubs and Tiffany windows, had been reduced to a mountain of rubble filled with tons of loose bricks, dust and twisted metal. Under a patchy blue sky, a lone worker, perched at least four stories high in a metal basket, pounded the remaining red-bricked jagged piece of wall with a sledgehammer, chipping it away brick-by-brick.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, Diane Chow, one of the tenants at 16 Second Avenue, the building closest to the razed building, came home to a cloud of dust. Sheets of dust. Brown bucketfuls that spilled into her three-bedroom apartment and even into a fish tank where her solitary blue tropical fish swam in muddied water.</p>
        <p>''My fish tank is messed up, my curtains,'' Ms. Chow said angrily. ''I'm lost. I've lost all of my stuff.'' She stood outside the building where her neighbors waited for the police to escort them inside so they could grab a handful of clothes.</p>
        <p>Sometime between when the first brick popped loose at Irreplaceable Artifacts on Thursday and a demolition crew bit into the crumpling shop with a brick-eating clamshell, city officials say, a debilitating rip appeared in the wall of the adjacent 20-unit apartment building where Ms. Chow and her neighbors lived. The vertical crack looked like a crooked seam stretching from top to bottom. The city is working to shore it up.</p>
        <p>But that will take days, officials said. And it was unclear when it would be safe enough for Ms. Chow and her neighbors to go back home.</p>
        <p>''It's very traumatizing for us,'' Ms. Chow said yesterday, standing near a police barricade and the few small bags she was able to retrieve. ''It's not fair.''</p>
        <p>Her neighbors agreed. ''I came back home, because I didn't have anything,'' said Sharmaine Sotomayer, 27, who wore a black backpack stuffed with clothes and toted another. The bags were filled with enough clothes to make do. Ms. Sotomayer and her 6-year-old daughter, Daizha, were staying with relatives. The lingering question is when they can return.</p>
        <p>''The worst part about it is we don't know where we stand,'' Ms. Sotomayer said. ''We're very upset.''</p>
        <p>The troubles for Ms. Sotomayer, a receptionist at a law firm, and her neighbors began when two floors in the salvage shop collapsed, tearing a three-story hole in its south wall. Officials said a construction crew had been working in the salvage shop despite an order from the Buildings Department stopping construction.</p>
        <p>The building's owner, Walter Blum, said the crew was only cleaning and preparing to do work once it had a permit, which he said had been approved by the city, in hand.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, as the last bricks were dislodged from mortar, Mr. Blum denied that work had been proceeding on Thursday. He also said city officials acted too hastily in deciding to demolish the store, operated by his son, Evan Blum. Irreplaceable Artifacts refurbished architectural fixtures like vintage paneling and fireplaces for use by Hollywood productions and others.</p>
        <p>''The city has no heart. It has no heart,'' the elder Mr. Blum said.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, denied that the city acted too hastily, saying an engineer had surveyed the building and found it posed an imminent danger. He said the extent of the work being done at the building, where a restaurant was planned, was under investigation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, city officials said, a contractor hired by the city would hem the crack in the wall of the apartment building where Ms. Chow and her neighbors lived. And the debris would be cleared away. ''The city wants to assure everybody that the building is structurally sound,'' Sal Cassano, a deputy assistant fire chief, said about 16 Second Avenue.</p>
        <p>Few places on the block were untouched by dust. Sheets of brown dust coated cars. It was on the shoes of the displaced residents as they returned to the places where they would be staying in the interim, either in a shelter or with relatives.</p>
        <p>Inocencia Tejada, 32, and her daughter, Noelle, 8, plan to stay with family. She and her daughter have been homeless before, she said, and neither can bear the idea of going to a shelter.</p>
        <p>''That's my first apartment in my life,'' said Ms. Tejada, adding that she has lived there for three years. ''That's my treasure. It's all I have.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Ms. Chow moved close to her bags. Inside one was the blue  tropical fish she had rescued from her apartment, barely moving in a dust-covered bowl of cloudy water.</p>
