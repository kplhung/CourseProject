        <p>Al Groh stood in the center of the field, 30 minutes into his first training camp as the Jets' head coach, when the zoom lenses that had been trailing his every movement swooshed away like a flock of pigeons in pursuit of a fresh crumb.</p>
        <p>At 9:30 a.m., with the rest of the Jets' brain trust already assembled at the sideline in an obvious show of support and enthusiasm for the start of a new season, Bill Parcells made a fashionably late entrance.

        <p>Al Groh stood in the center of the field, 30 minutes into his first training camp as the Jets' head coach, when the zoom lenses that had been trailing his every movement swooshed away like a flock of pigeons in pursuit of a fresh crumb.</p>
        <p>At 9:30 a.m., with the rest of the Jets' brain trust already assembled at the sideline in an obvious show of support and enthusiasm for the start of a new season, Bill Parcells made a fashionably late entrance. He never set foot on the field during practice, spoke only briefly to a few players, and spent most of the time chatting with the team's new owner, Woody Johnson.</p>
        <p>With every Jets player under contract, the bulk of Parcells's work is done for now. But as two-a-day practices began today with Groh establishing a reputation among his players for incredible attention to detail and straight talk, Parcells remains one of the most compelling people on the team.</p>
        <p>Cornerback Aaron Glenn admitted that during the morning session, it felt strange to see Parcells standing on the sideline. He wondered if Parcells was going to yell at players the way he used to.</p>
        <p>But with the first practice behind him and running back Curtis Martin saying that this team should be at least as good as the one that went to the American Football Conference championship game in 1998, Groh seemed to take a determined step away from Parcells in an effort to establish himself, once and for all, as a coach without a tether to the past.</p>
        <p>''It was a pretty sunny day out there today,'' Groh said. ''All I saw was sun. I didn't see any shadows. If you want to be meek and mild, the past lingers. If you want to be forceful and direct, the future happens in a hurry. If this team is a good team, it's because it will be a well-coached team. If this team is not a good team, it will be because it won't be a well-coached team. But it won't be because of who coached last year.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, Groh is going the forceful and direct route. In a meeting Thursday night, players said that Groh was explicit in explaining what he expected from them.</p>
        <p>Groh's intensity was obvious at the practices. Players had commented during minicamp that the practices were tougher than they remembered under Parcells, and there was plenty of hard hitting even in the first practice session today.</p>
        <p>During a running drill, Groh jumped into the middle of a huddle to yell kudos for a good play by right guard Randy Thomas. Members of the staff wore T-shirts that read: Smart! Tough! Disciplined!</p>
        <p>''I like his attitude,'' Martin, the club's top running back, said. ''He's a players' coach yet he's very stern, very direct about what he wants. I think that's what we need. It's very similar to what we had. It's not that he has to be like Bill. I think them being similar helps the team not go through any drastic changes. We're not going from hot to cold. Bill is a legend. He's done this thing a lot longer but Al has a desire to be as good if not better than Bill.''</p>
        <p>Players began camp with their typical mix of optimism over their prospects and dread of the grueling camp ahead. But whatever concerns remain about the upheaval of the off-season seem to have been shelved, at least for right now.</p>
        <p>''Just watching the way he controls things in the meeting room and on the field, everybody knows this is his team,'' center Kevin Mawae said of Groh. ''Yeah, he came from the Parcells regime, but somebody has got to come from somewhere, and who better to work under than Parcells.''</p>
        <p>Players may be comforted that Parcells is still around, but they should probably start dealing with any separation anxiety now. After all, Parcells skipped the afternoon practice.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>WOODY JOHNSON, the club's new owner, was at practice Friday. ''I have the highest expectations,'' Johnson said. ''That's our job, to provide a championship team to New York.'' . . . Defensive lineman SHANE BURTON, who signed as a free agent and is expected to compete for the starting right end job, broke his toe while fishing a few weeks ago and will miss practice until the discomfort eases. . . . KEVIN WILLIAMS, the backup free safety who suffered a life-threatening throat infection last season, made two interceptions in the morning session. AL GROH used AARON GLENN and receiver DEDRIC WARD on punt-return drills. . . . Left tackle JASON FABINI, recovering from a serious knee injury, participated in the morning session but was held out of the afternoon one. . . . Linebacker BRYAN COX was used as a fullback in goal-line situations and Groh said he would try other linebackers in the spot.</p>
