        <p>ZIMBABWE: LAND REDISTRIBUTION -- President Robert Mugabe said his government was to start redistributing land today to war veterans who invaded hundreds of white-owned farms earlier this year in support of his land seizure program. Speaking at the burial of an independence war commander, he said he would not brook domestic opposition or accept foreign criticism. Last month, the government listed 804 farms for seizure for its black resettlement program.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>BRAZIL: UPGRADING THE MILITARY -- The government announced a $3.5 billion, eight-year plan to modernize the air force by refurbishing 100 combat jets and buying 76 new supersonic fighters. Pressure has been building for a strengthening of the military's air wing to deal with increased drug-smuggling flights over the Amazon basin and the growing strength of left-wing guerrillas in neighboring Colombia.</p>

        <p>ECUADOR: FORMER PRESIDENT FACES ARREST -- The Supreme Court ordered the arrest of former President Jamil Mahuad and his finance minister on charges they exceeded their constitutional authority when they declared private bank accounts frozen early last year. Mr. Mahuad took the action to prevent the banking system from collapsing, but was overthrown in January after he announced that the American dollar would replace the sucre as Ecuador's currency. Relatives say he is the United States.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: RALLIES WIND DOWN -- A call by the Orange Order in Portadown for continued provincewide demonstrations against the ban on its march through a Catholic neighborhood went largely ignored, and the Protestant group's leader in Belfast said the protests should end. Northern Ireland has been convulsed by violence for the past two weeks. ''People have had enough,'' said Robert Saulters, grand master of the Grand Orange Lodge.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: LURE FOR FOREIGN EXPERTS -- Parliament's upper house passed a United States-inspired ''green card'' program entitling up to 20,000 foreign computer experts to work in Germany to fill a skills gap in computer technology. The experts must have university qualifications or prove they will be paid a minimum income of $48,000 per year to qualify for a visa. The plan was attacked by opposition conservatives as taking jobs from Germans. The bill becomes law on Aug. 1.</p>

        <p>FIJI: SANCTIONS THREATENED -- Rebels who had held the country's leaders hostage for 55 days, demanding the exclusion of Indians from government, handed in their weapons. But Australia and New Zealand threatened sanctions depending on the makeup of the government to be named on Sunday, and India said it would not support a government that included ''criminals.''</p>

        <p>VIETNAM: PRAISE FOR TRADE DEAL -- Trade Minister Vu Khoan praised a Vietnam-United States trade accord signed Thursday in Washington, calling it ''an important step in our integration into the world economy.'' In the United States, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. vowed to fight the pact's approval in Congress, saying it threatened labor standards and human rights.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: HOSTAGE LET GO -- Muslim rebels released a second Malaysian hostage after 83 days in captivity on the small southern island of Jolo. The rebels still hold 19 mostly foreign tourists, 3 French journalists who tried to interview the hostages and 13 Philippine evangelical Christians who came to pray over them. A German journalist and three Filipinos are apparently being held in separate kidnappings.</p>

        <p>KAZAKHSTAN: FORMER LEADER FREED -- Italian authorities released Akezhan Kazhegeldin, Kazakhstan's former prime minister, after holding him for two days in Rome at the request of Kazakhstan's Interpol unit. They said there were no grounds to detain him further. Mr. Kazhegeldin is a political opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and has been accused of money laundering and tax evasion in his homeland, which he has denied.</p>

        <p>MALAYSIA: TRIAL NEARING CLOSE -- Prosecutors completed their closing arguments in the sexual misconduct trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is already serving a six-year term for corruption. Defense lawyers now have a chance to rebut the arguments before the judge sets a date for his verdict.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON: PROGRESS SEEN ON BORDER -- The United Nations Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, said that most of the remaining nine Israeli violations of the Lebanese border have been rectified and the rest should be resolved soon, which would open the way for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon. Israel ended its 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon on May 24, but disputes over the border have prevented peacekeepers from taking up positions in the area.</p>

        <p>SAUDI ARABIA: EXECUTIONS -- Three Yemeni men were executed for engaging in homosexual acts and molesting young boys, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. It quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying that a court had found the men guilty of ''the extreme obscenity of homosexuality and imitating women'' in violation of Islamic rules that ban homosexuality.</p>
