        <p>The New York State Board of Regents voted yesterday to create an alternative certification program for teachers, hoping to draw people from other professions into the field to alleviate an acute shortage of teachers.</p>
        <p>The program, the first alternative certification route in New York, will be limited to college graduates with a degree in the subject they want to teach and at least a 3.0 grade point average.

        <p>The New York State Board of Regents voted yesterday to create an alternative certification program for teachers, hoping to draw people from other professions into the field to alleviate an acute shortage of teachers.</p>
        <p>The program, the first alternative certification route in New York, will be limited to college graduates with a degree in the subject they want to teach and at least a 3.0 grade point average. Any school system that wants to participate will have to work with a college or university to ensure that the new teachers earn the equivalent of an education degree in evening, weekend and summer classes over two years.</p>
        <p>''This is a way to get qualified candidates into the classroom quickly,'' Richard C. Mills, the state education commissioner, said yesterday. ''It should not be seen as an easy way to get a teaching credential. But it is tailored for those who are at a stage in their career where it is simply not appropriate to go back and do a traditional teacher education program.''</p>
        <p>The traditional way to become a certified teacher in New York State has been to get a bachelor's degree, typically either in education or in the subject that the person plans to teach, then to pass two state certification exams. Once they are on the job, teachers have to get master's degrees and pass an exam in their subject area within five years.</p>
        <p>But the Regents voted last year to make certification requirements more rigorous. Starting in 2003, teachers will have to major in the subject they plan to teach and take the exam in their subject area before they even begin teaching.</p>
        <p>Forty other states already have alternate routes for teachers, and some, like New Jersey, Texas and California, draw a large percentage of their teaching force from such programs. In New Jersey, which created one of the nation's first alternative certification programs in 1985, 22 percent of the teaching force in the 1998-99 school year had entered teaching through the program.</p>
        <p>In Texas, 16 percent of the teaching force that year had come through the alternative route.</p>
        <p>Teaching colleges have grumbled about alternative certification programs in other states because they either consider them a threat or believe that the programs cannot sufficiently prepare people for the rigors of teaching. But New York's plan is different from most because the programs will be run by colleges and universities, not by school systems or the state.</p>
        <p>Arthur E. Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University, praised the state's plan yesterday, saying that New York teaching colleges simply could not meet the urgent need for new teachers.</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is that the conventional route alone won't get us where we need to be,'' Dr. Levine said. ''Nobody ought to have a monopoly on training teachers at this point, and their training does not need to be cookie-cutter.''</p>
        <p>Of the roughly 230,000 teachers working in New York State's public schools, about 20 percent -- or 46,000 -- will need to be replaced over the next five years because they are nearing retirement age or lack certification, state officials said. Under new state regulations, teachers with temporary licenses, known as uncertified teachers, will not be allowed to work in the state's public schools after 2003.</p>
        <p>The state's teachers colleges produce only about 20,000 new teachers a year, and most of them do not stay in New York State.</p>
        <p>The alternative certification program will be especially valuable to New York City, with its 1,100 schools and 1.1 million schoolchildren. One-third of the city's 75,000 teachers are either uncertified or nearing retirement age, state officials said. In the 1999-2000 school year, 60 percent of the 9,000 teachers hired by the city were uncertified because so few licensed candidates were available.</p>
        <p>New York City will be the first school system to experiment with the state's alternative certification program. It has 1,700 applicants for a new program called New York City Teaching Fellows, which will place 250 new teachers in failing schools starting this fall. The teachers, mostly professionals who have tried at least one other career, will have mentors and take education courses at the City University of New York over the next two years.</p>
        <p>''This gives us a chance to inject new blood into the system at a time when we desperately need it,'' Harold O. Levy, the city schools chancellor, said yesterday. ''In the recent past, our alternative hiring strategy has been to hire virtually anyone who walked in off the street. With this program we can be more selective and potentially find genuinely gifted people.''</p>
        <p>Under the plan adopted by the Board of Regents yesterday, participants in an alternative certification program will have to pass two state certification exams and spend a summer taking education courses before entering the classroom. (The exception is New York City's program, which in its first year will require participants to attend an intensive training program in August and take the certification tests in October.)</p>
        <p>Teachers in the program must have mentors who are teachers in their school systems and must take courses over two years through the college or university operating the alternative program. Each school system will determine whether the teacher or the system pays for the courses.</p>
        <p>Each college that runs an alternative program will decide how many course credits the participants need to become certified. But most will require 18 to 24 credits, said Alan Ray, a spokesman for Mr. Mills. Colleges can choose to combine their alternative certification programs with master's programs, since the state requires all teachers to get master's degrees in their first five years on the job.</p>
        <p>Teachers generally need 30 credits to earn a master's degree in education, Mr. Ray said.</p>
        <p>Emily Feistritzer, director of the National Center for Education Information, a private research group in Washington, said that alternate-route programs had become much more popular in the last two or three years because teaching shortages had grown more pronounced. Another reason, she said, is that an increasing number of people want to drop the careers they started with and try teaching.</p>
        <p>''Ten years ago, it was unheard of for mid-career people to want to get into teaching,'' said Ms. Feistritzer, who has studied alternate-route programs since 1983. ''New York is behind the curve, but it's really just in the last few years that we're seeing the combination of shortages and an interest in teaching from people who didn't get education degrees.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the union representing New York City teachers, expressed enthusiasm for the alternative certification program yesterday. But she predicted that the program would not begin to solve the looming teacher shortage because teacher salaries were still much too low. The starting salary for city teachers is $31,910, and the union, whose contract expires this fall, is seeking across-the-board raises.</p>
        <p>''In the long term,'' she said, ''this program and any other effort to attract new teachers will fail if we don't fix the salary problem.''</p>
