      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Thank you for your sympathetic article. As the mother of Jean-Paul Stiller, I can testify that your writer was in the main correct. But I would also like to add that these children can be very appropriate in their social responses. During a recent fire in our house, Jean-Paul calmly said to his grandmother: ''There is a fire in the oven. Throw water on it.''</p>
        <p>His response to my calling him a hero? ''Grandma is a hero, too.'' Although he still cannot answer the phone correctly, he seems to have a deep understanding of critical situations.</p>
