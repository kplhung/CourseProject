        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The prospect of 12-year-olds with headaches, anxiety, insomnia and depression resulting from the pressure to get into top-tier colleges (front page, July 3) is disturbing, to say the least, and it doesn't bode well for the future health of our country.</p>
        <p>I fear that these children will not be at peace with themselves or their world when they grow up. Lacking the reference point of a stress-free childhood, they will in all likelihood be ''seekers,'' accumulating more and more yet never finding happiness.</p>

        <p>I wonder about the creative ability of a society that never laughed at the shapes of clouds, never looked for a four-leaf clover in a field and never took time to dress up a pet for Halloween.</p>
