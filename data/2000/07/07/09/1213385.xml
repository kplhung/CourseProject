        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Since Jack Kerouac made his home in the North Shore village during the late 1950's and early 60's, Northport has had a proprietary interest in him.

        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Since Jack Kerouac made his home in the North Shore village during the late 1950's and early 60's, Northport has had a proprietary interest in him. Hence, ''Kerouac's Northport,'' an exhibition of memorabilia (including his typewriter), photographs, videos and manuscripts, that today opens its run through Sept. 2 at the Northport Historical Society and Museum on Main Street with a reception at 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>Village Hall, also on Main Street, joins the celebration at 1 p.m. offering a performance by David Amram and Friends of ''Pull My Daisy,'' which Kerouac wrote with Mr. Amram and Neal Cassady; a reading by Kevin Twigg of Kerouac's works, and a round-table discussion featuring Mr. Amram; John Sampas, executor of Kerouac's estate; Larry Smith and Lennie Gross, friends of Kerouac, and Stanley Twardowicz, a local artist-friend. The library will also display materials from its extensive Kerouac holdings throughout the summer (631) 757-9859.</p>
        <p>Choral Festival</p>
        <p>If practise makes perfect, the singers at the Bald Hill Cultural Center in Farmingville on Saturday at 8 p.m. to perform Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' and Copland's ''Tender Land'' should be note perfect. Some 300 strong from all over the Eastern Seaboard and as far away as California and Texas, they have been going through their paces almost nonstop since Tuesday as participants in the Sixth Annual Brookhaven Choral Festival. In addition to the free finale, which will be accompanied by fireworks, there will be a concert devoted to the Jewish repertory at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow, and recitals at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday at the Knox School on Long Beach Road, and an organ recital at 8 p.m. Friday at Sts. Philip and James Church on Route 25A, all in St. James (631) 724-5117.</p>
        <p>All Aboard</p>
        <p>The East End Seaport Museum and Marine Foundation takes to the sea this week in two special events. On Wednesday, the museum sponsors a cruise to see the OpSail 2000 Parade, leaving aboard the Peconic Star II in Greenport at 8 a.m. to take anchor in New London Harbor and, on the return trip, stop at the Race, where shipwrecks and naval battles took place (631) 477-0004. Then, on Saturday, also aboard the Peconic Star II out of Greenport but at 9 a.m., there's a cruise that will explore off-shore Revolutionary War, War of 1812 and Spanish-American War sites and lighthouses and delve into the history of Plum and Gardiner's Islands, allowing close-up views of the latter (631) 477-2121.</p>
        <p>Back in History</p>
        <p>Still on the North Fork, the Oysterponds Historical Society celebrates its annual ''18th-Century Day'' on Saturday with a Revolutionary War encampment of the Third New York Regiment of Long Island; demonstrations of 18th- and 19th-century crafts; performances by an 18th-century magician; live period music; a children's petting zoo; and an antiques and collectibles fair. This all takes place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Poquatuck Park on Village Lane in Orient (631) 323-2480.</p>
        <p>In Huntington on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., that town's historical society marks the 250th anniversary of the Conklin House on the corner of New York Avenue and High Street with a an ''Old-Fashioned Barbecue and Birthday Party,'' complete with a Huntington Militia encampment, storytellers, children's games, house tours, music and a pie-tasting contest (631) 427-7045.</p>
        <p>Movie Time</p>
        <p>Film fans on the Island have something to look forward to tomorrow as two new weekly series open. In East Hills, at the Jacobson Jewish Community Center on Forest Drive, a ''Jewish Film Festival'' devoted to documentaries begins with ''The Port of Last Resort'' at 7:30 p.m. An Austrian-American effort, in German and English with subtitles, about how 20,000 European Jews escaped death by fleeing to Shanghai, the film will be accompanied by a talk by Evelyn Pike Rubin, the author of ''Ghetto Shanghai,'' a personal memoir. The series, through July 31, will also include ''Yidl in the Middle: Growing Up Jewish in Iowa,'' on July 24 (516) 484-1545.</p>
        <p>The films on tap at 7:30 p.m. at the Parrish Art Museum, Job's Lane in Southampton, are aimed at exploring ''the ups and downs of creativity and collaboration.'' They begin with ''The King of Masks,'' in Mandarin with English subtitles, Wuy Tianming's 1999 drama about an aging performer's search for a protege. Before the final screening of ''The Buena Vista Social Club'' on Aug. 21, the series will show films like ''Slam,'' July 24, and ''My Best Friend, Klaus Kinski!,'' Aug. 7 (631) 283-2118.</p>
        <p>Pops Goes the Music</p>
        <p>With four park concerts on the schedule this week, concert bands that specialize in pops dominate the music scene. The Nassau Pops Symphony Orchestra gets things started today at 8 p.m. at the Cross Street Park in Williston Park, playing selections from Broadway, television and the movies. The concert is repeated Friday at 8 p.m. at Greis Park in Lynbrook (516) 565-0646. Then, the North Shore Pops Concert Band take over with Big Band music, showtunes and light classics at 8 p.m. Thursday at Neptune Beach in Long Beach (516) 432-3890 and Friday at Eisenhower Park's Lakeside Theater in East Meadow, again at 8 p.m. (516) 572-0223.</p>
        <p>Ethnic Beat</p>
        <p>Ethnic music is another favorite this week with four concerts in the offing. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. is German-American Night at Eisenhower Park's Lakeside Theater in East Meadow (516) 572-0223, while Tuesday brings ''Patty Noonan's Musical Taste of Ireland'' to Veterans Plaza in Levittown at 8 p.m. (516) 489-4849. On Thursday, concertgoers have to chose between Andy Clooney in a concert of Irish music at 8 p.m. at Bethpage Community Park (516) 797-7900 and the Paul Pincus Group, which plays klezmer, at 8 p.m. at Rock Hall on Broadway in Lawrence (516) 489-4849.</p>
        <p>Way Off-Broadway</p>
        <p>To read or not to read is hardly the question at Guild Hall in East Hampton this summer; the John Drew Theater's nod in the direction of live theater will consist of play readings by two Off-Broadway companies: Blue Heron and the Abingdon Theater Company. Blue Heron comes in first tomorrow at 7 p.m. with ''Fanny and Walt,'' Jewel Seehaur-Fisher's play about the relationship between a 35-year-old Walt Whitman and Fanny Fern, a 44-year-old popular newspaper columnist. After two more entries by this company, July 24 and 31, the Abingdon group takes over with three readings in August (631) 631-4050.</p>
        <p>Laboratory Tours</p>
        <p>To add yet another dimension to its traditional free Summer Tours, which begin from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. today, Brookhaven National Laboratory will feature a different facility each week. So on opening day, the chemistry department gets the close-up look. And before the tours end on Aug. 27 with a visit to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider on Aug. 27, such programs as the National Weather Service, July 23; the National Synchrotron Light Source, July 30; and addiction research, Aug. 20, will be explored. These activities are in addition to the recently opened ''Camp Upton Historical Collection,'' an exhibition, and the ''Whiz Bang Science Show'' also featured in the tours. The lab is off William Floyd Parkway in Upton (631) 344-2651.</p>
        <p>Think Small</p>
        <p>The Ridder Miniatures Museum may be small in scope, but it thinks big in design. The current exhibition, ''Ruth McChesney's Roomboxes,'' features authentic recreations of actual historic rooms like a ''Tudor Room'' circa 1586, that exists in Levens Hall in Westmoreland, England, and the ''Spencer Anteroom,'' circa 1756, which is in the Spencer family's London house. Mrs. McChesney is a collector from Pennsylvania who commssioned artists and artisans from all over to create the furniture and accessories. The show runs through Sept. 17 at the museum on the grounds of the Nassau Museum of Art, off Northern Boulevard in Roslyn Harbor (516) 484-7841.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- The weekly ''Concerts on the Green'' in Stony Brook begin with Eastbound Freight, a bluegrass ensemble, at 8 p.m. at the Village Center on Main Street (631) 751-2244.</p>
        <p>THURSDAY -- The Smithtown Community Band opens its season at 8 p.m. on the library lawn on North Country Road (631) 862-6575.</p>
