        <p>FREUD's 'MEGALOMANIA'</p>
        <p>By Israel Rosenfield.</p>
        <p>173 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $21.95.</p>
        <p>FREUD showed us new ways of being curious about people's lives. And if his reticence about his own private life has been a provocation for some people, he has also helped these people by providing them with forms of suspicion, methods of investigation. He has told them where to look to find a scandal -- in a denied (that is to say, shameful) erotic life and in the aggression of a wish for prestige. He did everything he could to show us how stagy we are, that we are in love with disguise and dressing up; that we are at our most ingenious in our concealment of ourselves. It would not have been news to Freud -- as Israel Rosenfield intimates in his fascinating first novel, ''Freud's 'Megalomania' '' -- that people have something to hide or that the person one is most adept at hiding things from is oneself.</p>
        <p>People tend to be at their most Freudian in their unmasking of Freud. The wish to expose him or to discredit his work -- to reveal him as scurrilous in his personal life and duplicitous in his professional life -- seems merely to confirm one of his more useful suggestions: that we get to know people better by thinking of them as secretive. If the ''megalomania'' of Rosenfield's title trades rather archly on the so-called Freud wars, alluding to the notion that Freud's will to power was a little more pressing than his truthfulness, it is also a tribute to Freud as someone who saw the self consumed by its appetite for self-deception. Megalomania, as Rosenfield insists, one way or another, is the deception that there is no self-deception going on.</p>
        <p>In Rosenfield's novel, ''Megalomania'' refers to the title of a newly discovered, newly translated last work of Freud's, a manuscript he supposedly gave to his mistress as a legacy for their illegitimate daughter, whom he had effectively disowned. It is part of the very real artfulness of the novel that Rosenfield knowingly and amusingly exploits both the crassest of our suspicions about Freud and the most familiar of modern fictional conceits, the reported finding of a crucial document. If Freud's work is about the opportunism of memory, about the past as our most essential and uncertain resource, Rosenfield's novel uses a false memory -- a fictional piece of Freud's past, something that never happened -- to show and tell some very interesting things not simply about Freud and psychoanalysis but about the power of influential people in our lives. The novel urges us to look at ourselves looking at Freud and wonder what we want (or wanted) from him and what he wanted from us.</p>
        <p>''Freud's 'Megalomania' ''is carefully framed to sustain our expectations, but also to keep us mindful of the pleasures of pastiche. We know this isn't real, but Rosenfield makes us want to know just how good he is going to be at inventing it. (We are put in the position, that is to say, of a certain kind of analyst.) The novel is introduced by a Prof. Albert J. Stewart, who tells us the provenance of this manuscript -- both how it fits into the turbulent trajectory of Freud's work and how this hidden chapter in the history of psychoanalysis is of a piece with a more troubled personal history. But Professor Stewart is no Freudian. The first paragraph of his introduction is one stark sentence, ''I never liked Freud.'' Yet even this simplest of statements causes us to wonder whether he is referring to the work or the man.</p>
        <p>Indeed, at the very beginning of the novel it seems -- wrongly, as it turns out -- that we are being led by an all-too-familiar guide. ''For a long time I believed,'' Stewart writes, that Freud ''had been guilty of some of the worst intellectual brainwashing in history.'' But of course, like anyone telling us a story, Stewart has a number of complicated agendas. This is not to be merely the history of a lost manuscript, of a period in Freud's life. It also involves Stewart's own fraught relationship with another brilliant ''Leader . . . Teacher . . . Master . . . Man,'' his professional colleague and friend Norman Dicke.</p>
        <p>Dicke is a neuroscientist and, like Freud, the inventor of another explanation-of-everything, called, appropriately, Loop Theory. (''We are loops and we loop'' is one of Dicke's many memorable pronouncements.) For Stewart, as for Freud in his final and fortunately discovered work, the question is not ''Are these so-called geniuses, the Freuds and Dickes of this world, telling us the truth about ourselves and everything else?'' but ''What makes us so susceptible to these kinds of people?'' How is it that we can be at once so stimulated and so hypnotized by their words?</p>
        <p>IT is in ''Megalomania'' that Freud finally sees through -- sees through into -- the nature of authority. ''We know too much,'' Rosenfield's Freud writes, with suitable irony, ''to accept grandiose claims.'' What this Freud proposes in his last work -- and the text of ''Megalomania,'' which takes up almost half of the novel, is both a triumph of ventriloquism and itself a remarkable piece of lucid ''Freudian'' theory -- is the concept of the ''hallucinatory superego.''</p>
        <p>''The hallucinatory superego,'' this Freud writes, ''represents a special relationship between the individual and the totality of knowledge.'' This revelation becomes both a dismantling critique of Freud's own science and, by the same token, reinstates Freud as the supreme intelligence. ''What we know, and what we dare not say,'' he writes, ''is that the worth of a man, his value, is his ability to fake it, to respond in circumstances in which his ignorance is total without revealing, for even a moment, just how ignorant he is.''</p>
        <p>It is the megalomaniac -- whom Freud in this book calls the psychotic and who is internalized as a hallucinatory superego, an bermensch authority figure -- who seems to cure us of our consummate navete, who makes us so hungry for instruction. The megalomaniac is the person who can convince us that he knows what matters. And knowing what matters makes us seem to matter. ''It is not the content of the megalomaniac's thinking that is important to him,'' Freud writes in ''Megalomania,'' ''but his ability to create importance out of nothing.''</p>
        <p>What is most striking about this fictional last work of Freud's -- and it seems exactly right, as do so many of Rosenfield's judgments in this wonderfully contrived book -- is that it is overtly autobiographical. It shows Freud making theory out of his most immediate life circumstances. And the novel is particularly poignant in its evocation, without cynicism, of Freud's ambition, and of the devastating impact of World War I on Freud's every impression. ''Freud's 'Megalomania' ''is, in short, a triumph of that false-memory syndrome called contemporary fiction.</p>
