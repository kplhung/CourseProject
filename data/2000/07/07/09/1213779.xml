        <p>The wit, erudition and stylistic elegance that delighted us in the three previous novels of Sarah Caudwell, who died earlier this year in London, are abundantly at play in her final book, THE SIBYL IN HER GRAVE (Delacorte, $23.95). Thumbing her nose at the conventions of the well-made whodunit, Caudwell ransacks the literary forms that amuse her -- from the English village mystery and the 18th-century epistolary novel to the academic screwball comedy -- to devise an ingenious plot from all the pretty pieces.</p>
        <p>Hilary Tamar, the sexually ambiguous Oxford don who presides as narrator, delivers his/her customary droll account of the chronic chaos at the offices of the scatterbrained young barristers who provide this series with its raffish charm. Julia Larwood, a ravishing creature who resembles ''some particularly disheveled heroine of Greek tragedy,'' enlists the aid of her colleagues to resolve the ''beastly'' tax problem of her aunt, a chatty woman whose long letters from her West Sussex village reveal that she and her friends, including the vicar, are parties in a case of insider trading and murder. As the story careers off to Cannes with two of Julia's associates, more letters are exchanged, dumping a blizzard of ominous clues in her helpless hands. The humor is wicked, but the intelligence behind it is smart and sweet -- and, sadly, now gone.</p>

        <p>The wit, erudition and stylistic elegance that delighted us in the three previous novels of Sarah Caudwell, who died earlier this year in London, are abundantly at play in her final book, THE SIBYL IN HER GRAVE (Delacorte, $23.95). Thumbing her nose at the conventions of the well-made whodunit, Caudwell ransacks the literary forms that amuse her -- from the English village mystery and the 18th-century epistolary novel to the academic screwball comedy -- to devise an ingenious plot from all the pretty pieces.</p>
        <p>Hilary Tamar, the sexually ambiguous Oxford don who presides as narrator, delivers his/her customary droll account of the chronic chaos at the offices of the scatterbrained young barristers who provide this series with its raffish charm. Julia Larwood, a ravishing creature who resembles ''some particularly disheveled heroine of Greek tragedy,'' enlists the aid of her colleagues to resolve the ''beastly'' tax problem of her aunt, a chatty woman whose long letters from her West Sussex village reveal that she and her friends, including the vicar, are parties in a case of insider trading and murder. As the story careers off to Cannes with two of Julia's associates, more letters are exchanged, dumping a blizzard of ominous clues in her helpless hands. The humor is wicked, but the intelligence behind it is smart and sweet -- and, sadly, now gone.</p>
        <p>Admit it, you Florida beachcombers -- what you'd really like to find on those solitary walks is plundered treasure. Something beautiful and eerie, like the pre-Columbian gold medallion, glass beads and skull and bones that a young girl unearths in Randy Wayne White's TEN THOUSAND ISLANDS (Putnam, $23.95) shortly before she hangs herself. Doc Ford, the easygoing marine biologist who solves the crimes and describes the scenery in this nature-loving series set on Sanibel Island, is drawn into this strange matter when the girl's grave is looted by the same treasure hunters who have been tearing up Indian burial mounds, destroying the archaeological record and disturbing the fragile ecology.</p>
        <p>There is no real mystery about who's doing this nasty work, or even why; just mild curiosity about how far they'll go. But that's not why you want to read this series, which is colored with gorgeous scenes of coastal life above and below the water -- like the flock of frigate birds that Doc sees in flight over Lostman's River and the school of snook he spots off Don Pedro Island. No less than the oddball human characters who wash up in sea-shack bars from Gasparilla to Key West, these images give life to White's lovely seascapes.</p>
        <p>There are some devious minds at work in THE JUDAS JUDGE (Dutton, $23.95), the fifth police procedural in Michael McGarrity's robust regional series set in New Mexico's Tularosa Basin. One twisted brain belongs to the coldblooded monster who murders six people in six hours to give the false impression that a spree killer is on the loose in local campgrounds. Another shrewd thinker is Kevin Kerney, a deputy chief with the state police who sees through this cruel ruse and identifies the killer's real target as his final victim, a retired judge whose wife and son also died violently. It's a thrill to watch these subtle brains negotiate this convoluted plot, which loops with serpentine grace through the ranches, railroad towns, Indian reservations and open spaces of this territory. McGarrity is no nature writer, and his sketches of dusty desert towns like Alamogordo and Ruidoso are as blunt as his unsentimental character studies. Still, his portrait of the region is a strong one, built on meticulously detailed intelligence gathered, sifted and analyzed for unspoken secrets and lies by the author's own deeply cunning mind.</p>
        <p>There are things you have to watch out for if you want to be a good liar: switching tenses, allowing time lapses to creep into a narrative and starting thoughts you don't finish. And if you master these signs, the body language can still give you away; not just those shifting eyeballs and nervous tappy-toes, but the absence of other indicators -- like a raised pitch, shallow respiration and contracted pupils -- at appropriate times. I picked up all this great stuff from WHITE LIES (Pocket Books, paper, $6.99), Anna Salter's third novel in a fascinating series about a forensic psychologist named Michael Stone, who works with violent criminals and their victims. As this brilliant but testy heroine puts it, ''I tend to work with the kind of people who don't think about suing you, they think about shooting you.'' Salter takes her through two tricky tasks here: her own evaluation of a Boston anesthesiologist accused of flagrant sexual offenses, and a colleague's incest case that turns ugly and dangerous. Even when the storytelling swerves into Gothic melodrama, the clinical detail is never less than, well, instructive.</p>
        <p>If the streets of Chicago's South Side could talk, they would probably speak in the cracked voices of the bluesmen who shuffle through Ace Atkins's soulful mystery LEAVIN' TRUNK BLUES (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Minotaur, $22.95). More melancholy than ''Crossroad Blues,'' the debut book that sent a New Orleans blues historian named Nick Travers into the Mississippi Delta in search of some lost recordings by the legendary guitarist Robert Johnson, this dark journey takes Nick into the shady past of Ruby Walker, an old-time blues singer with a voice (''like sweet, sweet, cherry wine'') that testified for the speechless waves of Southern blacks who made the trek to Chicago in the great migration of the 1940's. Nick slams into some evil characters when he tries to reclaim Ruby from the prison cell where she has been wasting away for 40 years for the murder of her lover. (''He was so handsome, sharp as the devil's tail,'' is how an old woman remembers this Billie-Holiday's-kind-of-guy.) But the people you want to watch -- and, above all, listen to -- are the aged sidemen like Peetie Wheatstraw and Dirty Jimmy Scott who haunt vintage blues bars like the Palm Tavern and the Checkerboard Lounge, waiting for those long-ago train whistles to call them home.</p>
