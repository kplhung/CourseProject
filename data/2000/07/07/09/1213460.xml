        <p>For Westchester's wine lovers, Millbrook, a serene semirural community in Dutchess County, is both a destination for leisurely wine excursions and the brand name of a line of wines.</p>
        <p>Since 1981, when the Millbrook Vineyards and Winery produced its first commercial vintage, it has been the Hudson Valley's outstanding winery and one of New York State's best.</p>
        <p>All the whites and reds on the 130-acre estate are made from vinifera, the classic European wine grapes.</p>
        <p>Millbrook is owned by John W. Dyson and his wife, Kathe. Although he is perhaps best known now as a vintner, politics has been a forte; for a time, he was Rudolph W. Giuliani's deputy mayor for economic development.</p>
        <p>In 1979, as commissioner of the State Department of Commerce in Gov. Hugh L. Carey's administration, Mr. Dyson, a Democrat, coined the slogan ''I Love New York.'' Today, he also loves wine in California and Tuscany.</p>
        <p>Millbrook's aromatic '98 Tocai Friulano, a sprightly light-bodied white based on an Italian grape and long a food-oriented feature of its portfolio, is found around Westchester for about $13.</p>
        <p>The buttery-oaky, light-bodied simple '97 chardonnay, in a crisp Burgundian style that offers not an iota of California-type fatness, is about $15.</p>
        <p>And the opulent, jammy, smooth-textured, almost-sweet, mouth-filling Proprietor's Special Reserve '98 cabernet franc, based on a grape that in Bordeaux is used primarily for blending, is about $19.</p>
        <p>Open daily all year from noon to 5 p.m. for tastings and tours, the hillside winery occupies a spacious whitewashed Dutch hip-roofed dairy barn.</p>
        <p>It commands inspiring rural vistas and is situated near the junction of the Shunpike and Wing Road in Millbrook.</p>
