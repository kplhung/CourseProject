        <p>No doubt some people out there know there's a winery in the bowels of Paris's city hall. Or that the Incredible Hulk roller coaster at Universal Studios in Florida consumes enough electricity to power half a million homes. Travel Channel, however, is betting that most of us don't have a clue.</p>
        <p>By the time the new 50-part series ''Travel Channel Secrets'' runs its course, dedicated viewers will have been exposed to more esoteric trivia than they'll ever know what to do with. And that, say the series' producers, is exactly the aim of the show: to exhaustively explore little-known facts and fantasies about well-known places, including icons of tourism like Las Vegas, London, Hollywood, New York and Paris.</p>
        <p>Two back-to-back hourlong episodes of the show can be seen on Mondays and Tuesdays, beginning at 9 p.m. ''Paris Nightlife,'' tomorrow night at 9, includes a midnight tour of the city's sewer system, an interview with a dancer at the Moulin Rouge and a visit to Shakespeare and Company, where an aspiring, penniless writer might -- if he or she passes muster with the owner -- spend a free week or two on the carefully made beds scattered beside the bookshelves of this famous Parisian bookstore. (The bed in the Russian section, we are told by one young guest, is the most comfortable.) In the Wall Street segment on Aug. 7, we learn the location of defibrillators on the floor of the American Stock Exchange and the reason for suspending 3,000 video terminals and 200 miles of fiber optic cable from the ceiling of the New York Stock Exchange (the turn-of-the-century floor is too weak to support the weight). An exploration of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul on July 17 is about as exotic as the series gets.</p>
        <p>Though the subject matter is diverse, the 50 shows are linked by their devotion to the arcane, often delivered with admirable sobriety but occasionally accompanied with a heaping dose of hype (variations on ''the never before seen -- until now!'' commentary are not uncommon). Obvious clichEs aren't ignored either; they're just turned inside out. For instance, Paris's reputation as the city of romance is the perfect excuse to visit the School of Seduction, where a 36-year-old bachelor receives instructions on how to run his hand through his hair and affect a James Bond demeanor.</p>
        <p>Mark Finkelpearl, an executive producer of ''Secrets,'' is well aware that touring the cardiac ward of a New York hospital or following a department store security team around Harrods is not the kind of vicarious side trip one normally takes in a travel show. But it's his belief that if you're among the legion of armchair travelers whose aversion to slogging through an Amazonian jungle is so strong that you don't even want to watch somebody else do it on television, then this is the series for you.</p>
        <p>In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Finkelpearl said that ''Secrets'' was conceived about a year ago ''as a way to appeal to a mainstream audience.''</p>
        <p>''We wanted to be able to create a vehicle for viewers who aren't interested in traipsing across Patagonia,'' he added. ''The idea was to be able to go deeper into the character and history of popular places.''</p>
        <p>He and other Travel Channel executives are well aware that they have been underestimating the appeal of easily accessible places. In recent seasons, only about 25 percent of the channel's programming has been fully devoted to well-known tourist destinations. Shows like ''Lonely Planet,'' with its emphasis on cheap travel to far-flung places, have dominated the schedule.</p>
        <p>Steven Cheskin, the new senior vice president and general manager of Travel Channel (he arrived there little more than a month ago from Discovery Channel), says he has no intention of doing away with such exotic programming; he just wants to see the programming ratio reversed, with 75 percent of the schedule devoted to accessible destinations. Although he had little to do with the development of ''Secrets,'' Mr. Cheskin says the series works perfectly with his overall plans.</p>
        <p>''In the past, a lot of our programming was adventure series, treks to places many of us will never realistically travel to,'' he said recently. ''But after studying the ratings, we have seen that the popular locations have done much better than the far-flung.''</p>
        <p>In his view, that gorgeous stretch of untrodden South Pacific beach that we all think we yearn for is, without a doubt, mesmerizingly beautiful; the catch is that it's so mesmerizing that seeing it on television just might put the viewer to sleep. Peaceful refuges from the hordes, notes Mr. Cheskin, ''don't necessarily make for exciting television.''</p>
        <p>But going behind the crowded scenes of, say, Universal Studios, where one can watch technicians mix up batches of chartreuse slime or fabricate yards of silicon skin for an animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex -- now that's another story.</p>
        <p>The Universal Studios segment, on July 31 at 9 p.m., was produced by one of about 10 independent companies that Travel Channel used on the series; in this case, What About Me Productions. Like the other production companies, it was given broad but tough instructions. ''Our brief,'' said Mr. Finkelpearl, ''was simple: 'Surprise us. Tell us something we don't know.' ''</p>
        <p>What the filmmakers came up with is meant to be intriguing to all viewers, young and old, even those who may have little interest in traveling to a Florida theme park. In the Dr. Seuss attraction, we learn that special tools were created to fashion huge blocks of Styrofoam into Seuss's weird characters. There's not a single straight line in the entire exhibit; even the trunks of the palm trees, which were collected from hurricane-damaged areas, had to be curved, just like the lovely, doomed trufula trees in ''The Lorax.'' The ''Men in Black'' attraction, it turns out, has enough high-tech machinery to run an automotive assembly plant. And every night, members of the graveyard shift fan out with their mops and paintbrushes, tinker with the mechnical innards of robotic creatures and prepare the park for the next day's crowd of 50,000. Watching two tons of uniforms go down a gleaming laundry chute, the producers believe, can be oddly fascinating, even if going to Universal Studios is about as low on your list as an open-air camping trip on the Mongolian steppes.</p>
