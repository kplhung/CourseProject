        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William H. Honan's piquant leather-stocking tale last Sunday about finding a cannonball from the Battle of White Plains and how a small boy (himself) learned to hear the river speak speaks eloquently to succeeding generations of small boys and girls who are learning for the first time how curiosity can lead to the unique emotion of astonishment.</p>
        <p>Baruch Spinoza, the great philosopher of wonder, awe and astonishment, defined the latter in his seminal ''Ethics'' of 1677 as ''the imagination of an object in which the mind remains fixed because this particular imagination has no connection with others.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William H. Honan's piquant leather-stocking tale last Sunday about finding a cannonball from the Battle of White Plains and how a small boy (himself) learned to hear the river speak speaks eloquently to succeeding generations of small boys and girls who are learning for the first time how curiosity can lead to the unique emotion of astonishment.</p>
        <p>Baruch Spinoza, the great philosopher of wonder, awe and astonishment, defined the latter in his seminal ''Ethics'' of 1677 as ''the imagination of an object in which the mind remains fixed because this particular imagination has no connection with others.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Honan writes eloquently of his astonishment at finding the cannonball in the muddy Bronx River. ''How could it have traveled so far?'' he wondered. And as he takes a lifetime to find his answer in the nature of survival, he reassures me and my children and my grand niece and grand nephew, 6 and 5 years old, that we are surely not face to face for the last time in history, as F. Scott Fitzgerald mourned in ''The Great Gatsby,'' with ''something commensurate to [our] capacity for wonder.''</p>
