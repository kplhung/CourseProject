      <abstract>
        <p>Verlyn Klinkenborg Editorial Observer column takes dim view of CBS-TV's new 'reality based' program Big Brother, the companion to its Survivor series; asserts there is no reality in reality-based television, as everyone knows, but there is also no voyeurism if participants know they are being observed, and that is the letdown</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday night, the producers of ''Big Brother,'' the new ''reality based'' companion to ''Survivor'' in the CBS TV lineup, restaged O. J. Simpson's white Bronco chase across L.A., but with 10 S.U.V.'s instead of 1. Each S.U.V. carried a contestant who will be immured utterly without privacy day and night in a specially built house full of cameras and microphones for three months or until voted out of the bug-house by concerned viewers. The last contestant to remain wins half a million dollars. The first seven to leave earn just $350 a week, which, given all the overtime, is way below minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the rules of the ''Big Brother'' show state that ''You must not now be a candidate for public office and must agree not to become one until after the initial broadcast of all programs in which you appear.'' Too bad. I can't think of a better way to learn what we really want to know about Al Gore and George W. Bush than by throwing them into the ''Big Brother'' house for 90 days with eight putatively ordinary folks. Perhaps voter turnout in November would be higher if, as on ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother,'' a vote for a candidate were actually a vote against him.</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday night, the producers of ''Big Brother,'' the new ''reality based'' companion to ''Survivor'' in the CBS TV lineup, restaged O. J. Simpson's white Bronco chase across L.A., but with 10 S.U.V.'s instead of 1. Each S.U.V. carried a contestant who will be immured utterly without privacy day and night in a specially built house full of cameras and microphones for three months or until voted out of the bug-house by concerned viewers. The last contestant to remain wins half a million dollars. The first seven to leave earn just $350 a week, which, given all the overtime, is way below minimum wage.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the rules of the ''Big Brother'' show state that ''You must not now be a candidate for public office and must agree not to become one until after the initial broadcast of all programs in which you appear.'' Too bad. I can't think of a better way to learn what we really want to know about Al Gore and George W. Bush than by throwing them into the ''Big Brother'' house for 90 days with eight putatively ordinary folks. Perhaps voter turnout in November would be higher if, as on ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother,'' a vote for a candidate were actually a vote against him.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is no reality in reality-based television. Everyone knows that. But there is no voyeurism either, and that's the letdown. Everyone on the ''Survivor'' island and in the ''Big Brother'' house is perfectly aware of the cameras and microphones. In fact, the clause surrendering your privacy is underlined in the ''Big Brother'' rules. ''Survivor'' is Jerry Springer with sand, skin rashes and bad food. ''Big Brother'' has all the self-consciousness of ''It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' without the good writing and decor. If it is reality you want, spy on 10 people who do not know they are being watched. CBS still has much to learn from Allen Funt and old-line Stalinists.</p>
        <p>By ''reality,'' of course, CBS merely means that these programs are unscripted and that the castaways and housemates are ordinary people. But on the Web site devoted to ''Big Brother,'' the network has already turned the housemates into characters as identifiable as Urkel or Barney Fife. And, as ''Survivor'' and a half-century of TV have proved, a television camera tends to make people talk and behave in culturally scripted ways, the ways they have seen represented again and again on television. ''Survivor'' also proves that if you shoot enough footage and edit hard, you can make almost anything interesting, except the host of the show, who is really the only islander with anything to be ashamed of.</p>
        <p>You do not have to reach very far before the list of antecedents to these programs grows almost unmanageable -- it includes ''Gilligan's Island,'' ''The Tempest,'' ''Robinson Crusoe,'' ''1984,'' Albert Brooks's ''Real Life,'' Terry Gilliam's ''Brazil,'' and on and on and on. But the theme that really grabs the audience for these shows isn't shipwreck or communal living or imposed fasting or the collision between teamwork and self-reliance. What really grabs the audience is self-exposure and, in ''Big Brother,'' the chance to blackball, one by one, the characters in a TV show, a power we never had over ''Cheers.'' For now, the housemates in that Studio City bungalow-fortress are prisoners of their own exhibitionism. Only time will set them free.</p>
