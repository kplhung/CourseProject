        <p>When Evel Knievel failed to leap the Snake River Canyon or at least die trying on the same September Sunday 26 years ago on which President Ford pardoned former President Nixon, a promoter of the first event dismissed the outrage of TV viewers. He said that Knievel's inconclusive finish -- his motorcycle-cum-rocket sprouted a parachute that brought him safely down to the canyon floor -- was ''a realistic insight into American society; life isn't that clear-cut anymore.''</p>
        <p>The prophecy gains. Not only did Snake River presage Gotterdammerung for old Evel (a more aggressive John Rocker of his time, he was convicted of assaulting his publicist during a reportedly anti-Semitic tirade), but it led us to live with loose ends.</p>

        <p>When Evel Knievel failed to leap the Snake River Canyon or at least die trying on the same September Sunday 26 years ago on which President Ford pardoned former President Nixon, a promoter of the first event dismissed the outrage of TV viewers. He said that Knievel's inconclusive finish -- his motorcycle-cum-rocket sprouted a parachute that brought him safely down to the canyon floor -- was ''a realistic insight into American society; life isn't that clear-cut anymore.''</p>
        <p>The prophecy gains. Not only did Snake River presage Gotterdammerung for old Evel (a more aggressive John Rocker of his time, he was convicted of assaulting his publicist during a reportedly anti-Semitic tirade), but it led us to live with loose ends.</p>
        <p>There are loose ends all over the place. The PGA is asking the Supreme Court to drive Casey Martin off its lush green lawns. Rocker, Bob Knight and Mike Tyson are still with us, spirit and flesh. And the messages to thelipsite@aol.com have yet to slow in the wake of the anti-Evel rowboat journey of five 60-ish men; some make invidious comparisons to the stories that claim greater attention.</p>
        <p>This Rocker, my e-mail consensus goes, needs a couch, not a microphone, and I agree. When was the last time a baseball player referred to a productive teammate as a ''cancer,'' as the Braves' Brian Jordan referred to the 25-year-old relief pitcher. Unpopular, angry and self-destructive, Rocker lashes out to gain attention. There seems to be no mechanism to get him help. Is this the fault of baseball, its players' association, the Atlanta organization, Rocker, the news media, me, Evel? Who takes the blame for Tyson, or do we wait until his parachute finally fails?</p>
        <p>And what about Bob? Despite the occasional heavy-breathing call from Indiana, mentioning Knight evokes the meaty thud of a stick on a dead horse. He is over, defeated by his recent lack of success; abusing players can be construed as ''character-building'' only when you get into the Final Four. Knight's only remaining defense, that he ''ran a clean program,'' may have as much to do with the tenured sycophants who made sure no one on his varsity became academically ineligible.</p>
        <p>We are approaching the end of the age of the Big Daddy coach because college is no longer critical to professional advancement. You can go straight to the National Basketball Association from high school and soon you will be able to prep at a development league, the first step to a long overdue minor league.</p>
        <p>The PGA will be asking the Supreme Court to review a lower court decision allowing Martin, who has a circulatory disease in his right leg, to ride a cart during tournaments. Simplistically, one side offers a human argument for disability rights, the other an argument for the right of a sport to make hard-and-fast rules of fair competition. Both sides can use the phrase ''level playing field.'' Both arguments have weight and both evoke knee-jerk reactions. To make golf fair, it would make more sense at the moment to force Tiger Woods to play blind-folded. Or to play in a foursome with Tyson, Rocker and Knight. Something would have to rub off on somebody.</p>
        <p>Nothing is simple, which is good for my business. We have been following three women, two middle-aged former track-and-field champions with eight Olympic Games between them, and the gifted young 400-meter runner who reignited their quadrennial dreams. Eight days ago, 22-year-old Khadijah Conda was supposed to try to qualify for this week's Olympic trials in Sacramento, Calif., her last chance to fulfill the goals that her coach, Pat Connolly, and her mentor, Willye B. White, had envisioned for her great talent. But Conda did not run.</p>
        <p>Connolly wonders if she failed as a coach or if she didn't understand the Virtual Generation, for whom ''posing and posturing is enough.'' White thinks Khadijah failed herself. ''A vision without action is a hallucination,'' she said. I think Conda made a realistic decision for herself. Sensing that she did not share the passion, she opted for a career and a social life.</p>
        <p>Now, the decision 66-year-old Bill Lenderking made, to row from South Street Seaport to Shelter Island two weeks ago, was a covenant. He came out of a time when one died trying. This anti-Evel had not rowed since childhood and he did not look like the buffed subjects of the recent book, ''The Adonis Complex: The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession,'' but once he wrapped his long hands around the oars he knew he would finish. His four companions -- David Stookey, Louis Mackall, Tom Luckey and John Mullen -- were swept along by his commitment. They finished on schedule and found that the trip was not as hard as they had imagined. They wondered what else in life they had deferred or diminished because they had been too intimidated to try. They took all of us on their journey of discovery. But they weren't quite finished.</p>
        <p>The day after he rowed home, the 58-year-old Texas architect, Mullen, felt the need to get back in his rowboat.</p>
        <p>''I fear that I am becoming a bit obsessive-compulsive about this rowing thing,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''I puttered around Saturday morning and then in the early afternoon, seeing that the currents were propitious, hopped in the skiff and rowed 10 miles out to Montauk for a delicious cheeseburger at the Star Island Yacht Club and rowed home into the setting sun and the southwest sea breeze -- another perfect day.''</p>
