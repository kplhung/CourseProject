        <p>Re: ''To Get There From Here, Wait 20 Years'' (June 25):</p>
        <p>When I first heard of the Long Island Transportation Plan 2000, I was pleased that the Department of Transportation was soliciting input from the private community, a great way for the ''little guy'' to be heard.</p>
        <p>There were several subcommittees, each addressing some aspect of transportation: car travel, trucking, land use, etc. Each had 20 to 25 members from all walks of life. I joined the automobile group and was flattered to be voted chairman.</p>
        <p>One ground rule was that any and all suggestions would be considered. Some were unimaginative; some were radical. Another tacit ground rule was there would be no voting on these suggestions; all were to be included in the committee summary.</p>
        <p>After a few meetings, a very interesting tactic on the part of the D.O.T. became obvious: When the time came for suggestions, the department's observers (they were not members of the committees) would propose their favorite solutions, like widening roads and building more high-occupancy lanes. Their suggestions would then be included in the summary, giving them the appearance of having been endorsed by the subcommittee.</p>
        <p>The department's agenda proceeded like a well-oiled machine. Some volunteers began to feel we were being treated like pawns.</p>
        <p>We were told that after our meetings, all suggestions would be evaluated by a computer. This analysis included a ''fatal flaw'' criterion, which would reject recommendations that failed to meet standards of cost, technical feasability, etc.</p>
        <p>When the D.O.T. disclosed these analyses in June, it became obvious that a proposal contained a ''fatal flaw'' if it did not involve pouring megayards of concrete or endless acres of asphalt, to say nothing of the destruction of countless trees.</p>
        <p>I suppose this should not have come as a surprise. If the department did not propose building more roads, they would essentially be voting to decimate their bureaucracy and eliminate their own jobs.</p>
        <p>Properly carried out, L.I.T.P. 2000 could have served as a model for cooperation between a government agency and private citizens. Unfortunately, such was not the case. Many volunteers feel we were the victims of a hoax.</p>
        <p>If there was a positive aspect to this experience, it was in meeting fellow citizens who are concerned about the quality of life on Long Island and who do not wish to see it paved over from the Sound to the Great South Bay.</p>
