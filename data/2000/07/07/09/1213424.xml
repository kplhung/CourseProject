        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Neil Strauss recounts how he first ''connected'' with country music when his girlfriend played him a song about a small-town girl who keeps the coffee warm for her city man after his hard day at work [''The True Country Fan Has Southern Roots,'' June 25]. It's nice to see that chauvinism is still a bond that unites men everywhere, from the beer-chugging bubbas of the Deep South to the Yankees in ''positions of cultural authority'' who patronize them in supposedly enlightened publications.</p>
        <p>I'm certainly not the authority in my neck of the woods, but personally I prefer country like the Dixie Chicks' ''Let 'Er Rip'' or Mary Chapin Carpenter's ''He Thinks He'll Keep Her,'' which includes the lyric, ''When she was 36 she met him at their door/ She said, 'I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore.' '' Ain't nothing like the love of a small-town girl.</p>
        <p>Popular country music, it's true, is not something to be taken incredibly seriously. But I did want to remind Mr. Strauss that a number of his readers, including, we might presume, his girlfriend, are both ''small-town'' and women, and yet are worldly and intelligent enough not to appreciate being condescended to on either count.</p>
        <p>Maybe some of us are sweet when we're in love, but you said it yourself: a lot of us plain don't like you.</p>
