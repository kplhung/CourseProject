        <p>A trillion-dollar gift from the productive American economy has presented both the presidential candidates and voters with the possibility of addressing a number of competing national problems or political demands. According to revised budget estimates released last month, the government can expect an extra $1.3 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years, bringing the official surplus estimate to an astounding $4.2 trillion.</p>
        <p>After the deficit gloom of the 1980's, that number is so huge that it invites Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to engage in a war of  promises. Up to a point, that is healthy. A surplus of more than $4 trillion ought to spark debate about options whose price tags have until now scared off all but the most intrepid of politicians. Yet the voters cannot become intoxicated by the numbers to the point of believing that it is possible to have tax relief plus hugely expensive new programs and significant debt reduction all at the same time. The important task remains choosing policy targets wisely.</p>
        <p>Before allocating this anticipated bonanza, Congress will have to make some critical subtractions. About $2.3 trillion of the $4.2 trillion surplus comes from the Social Security program. Politicians are nearly unanimous that this money should be used to pay off the federal debt. Congress is also moving fast to use $400 billion in Medicare surpluses for the same purpose. Though that does not have any practical effect on the solvency of either program, debt repayment is supported by a bipartisan Congressional majority as a good step for the economy and hence the long-term stability of essential services. So subtract about $2.7 trillion, which leaves a surplus of around $1.5 trillion.</p>
        <p>Then there is another factor squeezing down the size of the usable surplus that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have to argue over. Budget estimates assume that spending on most existing federal programs outside Social Security and Medicare -- covering everything from scientific research to law enforcement -- will remain unchanged. In fact, reasonable spending growth and Congress's reluctance to let several temporary tax credits expire will eat up $600 billion, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. The upshot is that by this reckoning the next president and Congress will have slightly less than $1 trillion of the original $4.2 trillion to pay for new programs or tax cuts.</p>
        <p>There will be time later in the campaign for voters and for this page to choose their priorities for the uncommitted surplus. Right now, it is an illuminating exercise to do some price shopping that will show how limited a list that $1 trillion covers. For example, a program to provide universal access to health insurance like that proposed by Bill Bradley during his presidential campaign would probably cost between $600 billion and $800 billion over 10 years. Adding a decent drug benefit to Medicare would cost more than $200 billion over 10 years. These proposals alone would consume nearly the entire surplus, as would closing long-term fiscal imbalances in Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>This information helps frame the discussion of tax and spending proposals being put forth by the presidential candidates and by many Congressional candidates, as well. On the Democratic side, Mr. Gore proposes to cut taxes by about $500 billion over 10 years, creating subsidies for college tuition, individual retirement accounts, child care, individual health coverage, nursing-home care, energy conservation, low-wage workers and married couples. He would spend about $250 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees and about $300 billion for transportation, energy projects, medical coverage for low-income families and education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush would cut taxes by more than $1 trillion over 10 years. He also proposes to increase defense, health and other domestic spending by more than $200 billion. His plan to divert part of the payroll tax to create private Social Security accounts would eventually draw on general tax revenues by an unknown amount that could run into the hundreds of billions.</p>
        <p>In other words, both candidates are advocating programs with differing ideological bases, but with the common feature of exceeding the available surplus. In the early 1990's, Congress conquered the deficit by carefully taming the growth of spending and raising taxes. The current task of managing a burgeoning, though temporary, surplus requires no less care. There are lots of worthwhile objectives. But the debate has to start with an acknowledgment that the expendable surplus is only about a quarter of the $4.2 trillion total. Then comes the task of making the candidates reveal how they would choose among health coverage, education improvements, Medicare reform and tax cuts.</p>
