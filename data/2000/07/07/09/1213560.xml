        <p>Stephanie Lynn Jones, a performance artist, and Nathan Sanford Dudley, a teacher, are to be married today at the First Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn. Donna Walker Kuhne, a minister of religious ceremonies for Soka Gakkai International USA, a Buddhist lay organization in Manhattan, will officiate. The Rev. Dr. Paul Smith, the pastor of First Presbyterian, will take part in the ceremony.</p>
        <p>''You won't find too many weddings where there will be Buddhist chanting and gospel singing,'' said Mr. Dudley, who teaches history, media studies and economics at Arturo A. Schomburg Satellite Academy High School, an alternative public high school in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones, who will keep her name, graduated from Howard University and is a member of the Jones Twins, a collaboration with her identical twin sister, Suzanne. They have performed at the Franklin Furnace in Manhattan and the BAM Cafe in Brooklyn, doing a combination of stand-up comedy, music and autobiographical poetry, mostly about growing up in an African-American family in an otherwise all-white neighborhood in Michigan. The bride is also a candidate for a master's in musical-theater writing at New York University.</p>
        <p>She is a daughter of Harriet S. Jones and Dr. Edward A. Jones Jr. of Grand Rapids, Mich. Her father retired as the head of pulmonary and critical care at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Rapids. Her mother, also retired, was the director of nursing at the Riverside Correctional Facility in Ionia, Mich.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudley, who graduated from Yale University, is the son of Shirley Dudley and the Rev. Carl S. Dudley of Hartford. His father is the professor of church and community at the Hartford Seminary.</p>
        <p>The couple were introduced by a mutual friend four years ago at Lucky Cheng's, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan. ''I remember thinking, 'Wow, she's really tall and really beautiful, and look at that hair!' '' Mr. Dudley said. ''It was flowing and very striking.''</p>
        <p>Both describe their courtship as a learning experience. She says he taught her about South America, where he had lived and traveled extensively. And she introduced him to the downtown performance art scene. She also pushed him to quit his job in sports marketing and become a teacher, a longtime dream of his.</p>
        <p>''In four years, we went through some rough moments, but the reason I'm really happy to be getting married to Stephanie is she really helped me grow spiritually,'' he said. ''And, I want to be with someone who helps me grow.'' He proposed last New Year's Eve in Copacabana, Brazil. Throughout the day, he gave her several wrapped packages, each containing a gemstone ring. ''She got a ring at 3 and a ring at 6 and a ring at 9 and a ring at midnight,'' he said. By the time he asked her to marry him, halfway through the millennial fireworks, she had rings on many fingers.</p>
        <p>During their wedding, the couple plan to participate in a Japanese sake ceremony in which they drink from three different cups -- a small one representing the past, a medium-size one representing the present and a very large one symbolizing their future and everything they bring together.</p>
        <p>''We're both very independent and have our own lives,'' the bride said, ''but when we come together we bridge a lot of different people and communities and backgrounds. I think that's what marriage can be, a way of bringing together different worlds.''</p>
