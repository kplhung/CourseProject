        <p>CORBETT-James Davidson. Of Sarasota, FL and Huletts Landing, NY passed away on July 6, 2000 just shy of his 90th birthday in Sarasota. He was the son of Theodore and Achsah Davidson Corbett. Jim was born in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle and graduated from New Rochelle High School in 1928. He was a member of the Dartmouth class of 1932 and graduated from the Stern School of Business at NYU. Jim's career took him from Chase Manhattan Bank to Standard and Poors to Merrill Lynch, where he became the youngest Partner, ever, in 1952. He retired from Merrill Lynch in 1970 as head of the firm's research department. Jim is preceded by his wife, Amy, and his oldest daughter Suzanne Corbett Cooper, and his brother Theodore Graham Corbett. Survivors include his sister Elizabeth Corbett Skahan of Hague, NY, daughters Martha Corbett Leith, of Michigan and Huletts Landing, NY, Jane Corbett-Floyd, of Arizona and Huletts Landing, NY, grandchildren Amy Cooper Savage, Scott Floyd, Kevin Floyd, Corbett Leith, Sarah Leith and two great-grandchildren, Andrew and Suzanne Savage. Upon retiring he and Amy moved from East Williston, Long Island to Huletts Landing, on Lake George. Jim was very active in the Lake George Association, receiving the Charles E. Tuttle Award in 1985. He was also active in the Huletts Landing Fire Department and the Mountain Grove Memorial Church. Jim started The Fund For Lake George and continues as a Director Emeritus. It is his wish that memorial donations go to The Fund For The Lake, Inc., P.O. Box 349, Lake George, NY 12845. A memorial service will be held later this summer in Huletts Landing, time and date to be announced.</p>
