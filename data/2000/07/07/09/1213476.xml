        <p>When people come to the Jersey Shore, talk is usually about sun and sea and sybaritic pursuits, not politics and patriotism. Marvin Hume understands that, so he asks visitors for only a few moments of their time to think about why they have the freedom enjoy pina coladas on the decks of their beachfront cottages.</p>
        <p>Every evening from May to October Mr. Hume honors his country with a five-minute sunset ceremony at Sunset Beach, a small promontory where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
        <p>If the weather is nice -- as Mr. Hume claims it is almost every sunset in the summer -- about 300 people gather to see his flag fiesta. He chooses four youngsters from the crowd and goes on a public address system to have everyone look toward the flagpole at the edge of the parking lot near the beach.</p>
        <p>Then he asks adults to explain to their children the meaning of the American flag and puts on a recording of Kate Smith singing ''God Bless America'' and then the United States Army Band's version of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.'' As the national anthem wafts into taps, Mr. Hume and his young helpers lower and fold the large flag.</p>
        <p>He has been doing this for the last 28 years.</p>
        <p>''I think people are a lot more patriotic than they let on,'' said Mr. Hume. ''Liberal, conservative, whatever. They all seem to like the little ceremony here.''</p>
        <p>In truth, the ceremony starts about 20 minutes before the sun sets.</p>
        <p>''We actually finish before sunset,'' he said. ''If people turned away from the flag and saw the sun was already below the horizon, well, they'd be pretty mad at missing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hume insists there are no commercial underpinnings to the ceremony -- even though he owns the property at Sunset Beach. In addition, surrounding the parking lot are the Sunset Beach Grill and three gift shops that he owns. He says the Sunset Ceremony came long before he owned the site, and that he feels obligated to continue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hume owned Boardwalk Rock and Shell Shop at Park Place and the Boardwalk in Atlantic City and had started a side business wholesaling seashells to other shops along the Shore. It was then that he developed a friendship with Preston Shadbolt, who owned Sunset Beach. When Mr. Shadbolt retired in 1972, he asked Mr. Hume if he would want to buy the business.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Shadbolt and I had both been in the service,'' Mr. Hume said. ''I was in the Navy Air in the South Pacific during World War II, and when he asked me to raise and lower the flag every day at his old wooden flagpole, I was only glad to do so.''</p>
        <p>Eventually, the wooden flagpole started deteriorating and Mr. Hume got the Magnesite Company -- a mineral-extracting business in Cape May that is now closed -- to donate its steel flagpole for the Sunset Ceremony. In the 1970's, he put an advertisement in a local paper asking if anyone would be willing to donate a veteran's casket flag for the ceremony.</p>
        <p>''One ad once and I've never had to ask again,'' he said. ''I get about seven or eight donated a year. They are usually too big to fly on a front porch, so people are glad that they get used for something like this.''</p>
        <p>Sunset Beach itself is an odd slice of New Jersey. Just a few yards offshore are the remains of the Atlantus, a goofy American military experiment. Of 12 concrete ships built during World War I, the Atlantus is the only one left. Never practical, the Atlantus broke from its moorings in 1926 and was intentionally sunk as a jetty at Cape May Point.</p>
        <p>Sunset Beach is also ground zero for one of the Jersey Shore's great ruses besides the slicer, dicer, peeler, cooker -- Cape May diamonds. Legend has it that early in the last century, unscrupulous jewelers collected shiny rocks that are found where the bay meets the ocean and tried to pass them off as diamonds. The shiny rocks are still a bit hard to find, but Mr. Hume's shops will sell their cache for 50 cents to $3 apiece.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Hume says he doesn't care if anyone buys anything, as long as they appreciate his Sunset Ceremony.</p>
        <p>''I've traveled all around the world and I always come back appreciating what we have in America,'' he said. ''If parents come here and teach their kids that during our ceremony, that is payment enough for me.''</p>
