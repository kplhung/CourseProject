        <p>THERE was, forgive the expression, still a buzz in the air last week, after the discovery of a marijuana farm in an exclusive neighborhood in Rye.</p>
        <p>On June 28, county police officers patrolling in a helicopter spotted a scarecrow guarding two clusters of tall stalky plants, 75 in all, in an otherwise overgrown section of the Edith G. Read Natural Park and Wildlife Sanctuary next to Playland, the amusement park in Rye.</p>
        <p>The area is just south of Manursing Way, a pastoral road with only a handful of large homes, which is  traveled mostly by joggers and people driving to two beach clubs on  Long Island Sound. But it is unlikely the patch could have been spotted either by road traffic or park-goers in rented paddle boats on Playland Lake.</p>
        <p>''It was so overgrown, you couldn't see it if you were standing five feet away,'' said Mark Pierro, a detective in the county police's narcotics unit, who jumped down to the spot from the helicopter after the police were unable to enter by foot. Once inside, the police found a well-hidden crawl space through the underbrush to the road along with farming tools painted green, buckets of plant food and a green chain-link fence around the area.</p>
        <p>The plot was larger than the typical covert marijuana patch, which is usually 20 or so plants together but planted in separate spots to elude detection, the detective said.</p>
        <p>''This wasn't some teenagers throwing down seeds for their own recreational use,'' said another police officer involved in the investigation. ''This was done for profit.''</p>
        <p>Most of the preserve is a wooded area with dirt paths. But the plants were being grown in a well-kept garden in a neglected area thick with poison ivy and briar bushes, with a direct view of the Playland ferris wheel.</p>
        <p>The police said the crop, when harvested, would have had a street value of at least $150,000. But because the plants were hardly mature and would not weigh enough to bring stiff charges on the grower, the police confiscated the plants rather than waiting for the cultivator to return.</p>
        <p>''We would've had to wait for two more months of growth to make this a felony offense,'' one officer said, ''and then you risk kids getting in there. It's just not responsible.''</p>
        <p>Also, the police had altered the entrance way to get at the crop, which would have tipped off the grower, they said. And since the crop was on county land, it would have been difficult to prove who was tending them unless someone was actually harvesting them.</p>
        <p>The police called this the largest seizure of marijuana grown outdoors in years in Westchester. (Many seizures of home-grown marijuana are now made from indoor farms that use special lighting, which the police often discover by finding unusually high electric bills.)</p>
        <p>Though illegal, marijuana remains a large cash crop in the United States, but it is mostly grown in the Midwest and on the Pacific Coast where there is more wilderness than in southern Westchester. Many neighbors were surprised that the distinctive five-leaf plants went undetected on public land.</p>
        <p>''We're still in shock,'' said Kathleen Little, the mother of five young children, whose backyard abuts the  site. ''I know almost everybody I see on this road.''</p>
        <p>An au pair from South Africa working in a house across the street from the preserve seemed somewhat confused by the hoopla. ''We have it growing wild all over the place back home,'' she said. ''No one even cares.''</p>
        <p>Other residents seemed slightly in awe.</p>
        <p>''It was a bold move, and you've got to respect that,'' said Jon Garabieta, the manager at Playland Market, a grocery store. ''It's protected land, and that's exactly why they chose it.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Corbia, who works the entrance booth at the nearby Westchester Country Club's beach club, said that members were amused by the news but far from surprised.</p>
        <p>''No one batted an eye,'' said Mr. Corbia, who is also a health teacher at Port Chester High School. ''Who's fazed by marijuana these days?''</p>
        <p>''It's got to be local kids,'' he said, waving one luxury car after another into the club last Wednesday. ''This is a wealthy neighborhood, but every kid wants to make extra money. Most of them think it should be legal anyway.''</p>
        <p>Not Detective Pierro. He said the police would step up searches for ad hoc marijuana gardens in the county.</p>
