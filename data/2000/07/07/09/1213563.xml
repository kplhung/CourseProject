        <p>FOR Keith B. Brown, the top marketing executive for the $512 million Amerindo Technology fund, one of the most prominent stars in the firmament of technology offerings, the second quarter was, if not the best of times, then not too shabby. Investors deposited some $12 million into his fund during the quarter -- even amid the gyrations of the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index.</p>
        <p>For his boss, the money manager Alberto W. Vilar, the second quarter was, by contrast, definitely disappointing: the fund lost a stomach-churning 26.7 percent for its investors.</p>
        <p>The story played out much the same at other mutual funds with a sweet tooth for technology -- whether aggressive-growth funds that populate so many 401(k) plans, the scores of technology sector funds that run tens of billions of dollars or the dozens of Internet funds that have emerged virtually overnight over the last two and a half years. For these fund groups, the second quarter of 2000 turned out to be a tale of two executives.</p>
        <p>While the honeymoon ended for techno-centric money managers, their marketers still seem to be enjoying a surprisingly easy sell. No matter that the average technology sector fund was down 11.2 percent in the quarter. Or that the Nasdaq composite index lost 13.3 percent. Or that Internet companies were forced into a round of belt-tightening, layoffs and, in the case of online retailers like Boo.com and Toysmart.com, into bankruptcy. Or even that institutional investors seemed to be displaying a distinct coolness to the sector.</p>
        <p>Indefatigable individual investors kept buying technology funds. Cash flow into technology sector funds totaled $1.97 billion  for April, the worst month of the technology sell-off, according to AMG Data Services, a research firm in Arcata, Calif.; investors sank an additional $1.09 billion into the funds in May. Although that is far below the record $10.97 billion that flowed into such funds in February, the month before the Nasdaq composite peaked, it is in line with what investors were putting into the funds in 1999.</p>
        <p>Weekly figures compiled by AMG, which cover a smaller universe of funds, show the trend continuing in June: cash flows increased assets by an estimated 2 percent for the month.</p>
        <p>In other words, individual investors have not turned tail from technology in the way that scores of institutional money managers and analysts had predicted they would in the event of a market correction.</p>
        <p>''What surprises me about the numbers is that they've held up so well,'' said Robert Adler, president of AMG. ''Investors haven't abandoned the market, and they haven't abandoned technology.''</p>
        <p>Contrast that with investors' behavior during another period of market extremes, the emerging-markets meltdown of 1998. According to AMG, outflows from emerging-markets stock funds totaled $4.05 billion for the year, 12.3 percent of total assets.</p>
        <p>In a market environment that many people see as increasingly driven by individual investors, sentiment is crucial. Even as institutional investors -- pension and hedge funds in particular -- showed signs of retreat, individuals are charting their own direction. If their money continues to pour into technology and aggressive-growth funds, the shocks of April and May may well register as only a breather in the aging bull market.</p>
        <p>Technology is still perceived, correctly or not, as the likeliest indicator of the market's future direction, if for no other reason than that more than one-third of the market capitalization of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index is in technology stocks.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY, of course, takes several avenues into the American portfolio. Sector funds are only one, accounting for only about 2 percent of the $7 trillion mutual fund industry. Far more important are the nation's growth funds, the 800-pound gorillas of the industry that form the backbone of so many portfolios and retirement plans. During the meteoric run-up in technology stocks in 1998 and 1999, many growth funds became de facto technology funds.</p>
        <p>Consider the $29.8 billion Fidelity Growth Company fund, the sixth most popular fund in defined-contribution retirement plans, according to a study by Pensions &amp; Investments magazine. At the end of the first quarter, 53.2 percent of the fund's portfolio was in technology, more than double the fund's position a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the $28.2 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund, another top 10 retirement fund, was 43.4 percent invested in technology, up from 26.2 percent a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Other popular growth funds were even more heavily weighted in the sector. At the end of the first quarter, the $31.8 billion Janus Twenty fund had nearly 60 percent of its portfolio in technology stocks.</p>
        <p>Investors continue to strongly favor these growth funds over funds whose managers practice a value strategy, which emphasizes stocks that are priced at a discount relative to their intrinsic worth. Though the sales gap between value and growth narrowed in the second quarter, value-oriented funds still suffered net outflows of $6.6 billion in April and May, while growth funds took in $31 billion.</p>
        <p>''The big picture is that people are still playing where the action has been,'' said Donald L. Cassidy, a senior research analyst at Lipper Inc. ''They haven't panicked and they're not bargain hunting.''</p>
        <p>John Rekenthaler, research director of Morningstar Inc., added: ''I don't think anybody's faith in aggressive-growth investing has been rocked, or fundamentally changed. Two months doesn't change people's belief system.''</p>
        <p>TO are investors showing foresight or folly in their continuing rush into technology? Or have investors just  become used to buying on dips in volatile markets?</p>
        <p>Avi Nachmany, president of the consulting and research firm Strategic Insight, called it ''a renaissance of national optimism.''</p>
        <p>''The theory I have, why the commitment to new-economy investing transcends the price level, is that in the end, you look at your own personal experiences and ask, 'How has my life changed with the Internet?' '' Mr. Nachmany said.</p>
        <p>''There are many experiences that are fundamental to your well-being. The e-mail you get from your grandmother in Florida, the health advice you can get before you go to the doctor, the cheaper plane tickets. We're just in the beginning of these kinds of experiences. They will continue, regardless of the prices on the Nasdaq.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar, whose fund remains one of the top 10 performers over the past three years despite last quarter's drubbing, agreed. ''The trading in Internet stocks has been dominated by individuals. A lot of people who bought the AOL's, the eBays or Yahoos were the people who used them, the clients,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It seems natural, of course, that if investors continue to buy technology stocks, technology stock prices will keep going up. Perhaps that was one reason the Nasdaq recovered in June, gaining 16.6 percent. But James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and known for his bearish views, says continued flows into technology will just make the day of reckoning that much more painful.</p>
        <p>''The disappointment will be sharper,'' Mr. Grant said. ''Artificial support under a fundamentally deteriorating market does not change the fundamentals. It deepens the ultimate disappointment. We do live in an age of technological miracles, but that does not change the cyclical nature of markets.</p>
        <p>''Flows will help at the margins, but they can't perpetuate a trend indefinitely,'' Mr. Grant added. ''They can't perpetuate technology indefinitely.''</p>
        <p>Even as individuals went in, institutional investors showed signs of pulling back. In May, $315.4 million flowed into the technology sector from small trades -- those of less than 10,000 shares -- according to Birinyi Associates, which tracks money flows in and out of the market; such small trades generally come from individual investors. But larger block trades from institutional investors took $502.4 million out of the sector in May; it was the fourth month of outflows in the last five.</p>
        <p>That is not a total surprise. Institutional money managers are more prone to short-term portfolio shifts, because they are usually judged on a quarterly basis and adjust their allocations to conform with risk benchmarks.</p>
        <p>Many experts say retail investors will play the tune for the current market. ''I don't think investors will go on strike,'' Mr. Vilar said, ''and the reluctant brides, the institutional investors, will be dragged to the altar.''</p>
        <p>IT is testimony to the resilience of technology fund investors that fund families  have had the confidence to add technology offerings -- and be rewarded for doing so.</p>
        <p>When Munder Capital Management, the company that runs the nation's largest Internet fund, Munder NetNet, started an international Internet fund, Munder International NetNet, on April 10, into the teeth of a collapsing market, investors still poured money in. By the end of May, despite losing money in the market, the fund had $367 million in assets.</p>
        <p>And Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund company, filed on June 30 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to start Fidelity Select Networking and Infrastructure.</p>
        <p>To John C. Bogle, the retired founder of the Vanguard Group, America's continued infatuation with technology sector funds has not brought out the best in the mutual fund industry.</p>
        <p>''The industry has had fads all through its history,'' Mr. Bogle said, citing bursts of interest for atomic energy funds in the 1950's and biotechnology funds in the early 1990's. Last quarter also saw the start of a genomics-only fund, tapping into enthusiasm over the mapping of the human genome.</p>
        <p>''We used to sell what we made,'' Mr. Bogle said. ''Now we make what sells.''</p>
