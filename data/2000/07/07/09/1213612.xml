        <p>IN this election season, helping the elderly pay for their pills is a political no-brainer: everybody's for it. The fight is over how to do it. Republicans, not surprisingly, want private insurers to run any prescription drug benefits plan. Democrats, not surprisingly, want the government in control.</p>
        <p>But that classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real issue: how much drugs will cost, and who will set their prices.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the cost of medication, which is why it is consuming the political landscape this year. Last week, Vice President Al Gore attacked drug manufacturers, accusing them of price gouging. The week before, the House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed plan to give subsidies to insurance companies that offer prescription coverage, a concept favored by the drug makers.</p>
        <p>The furor is justified, economists and policymakers say. ''It's the part of the budget that is breaking the bank,'' said Dr. David A. Kessler, who ran the Food and Drug Administration before becoming dean of the Yale University School of Medicine. ''Ask any hospital administrator, ask any H.M.O. Prescription drug prices is the one sector that is out of control.''</p>
        <p>Prescription drugs are now the fastest-growing part of the nation's health care bill. That is not so much because manufacturers are raising prices for existing drugs, but because patients are switching to newly approved medicines that cost more, and more prescriptions are being written than ever before.</p>
        <p>In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans spent $91 billion on prescription drugs; the total is expected to reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate burden: they account for 13 percent of the population but more than a third of drug expenditures.</p>
        <p>Yet any effort to bring down costs is fraught with unanswered questions. To begin with, drug makers dance around the question of how they set prices. The official explanation is that the cost of medicine is justified by the high cost of research and development, which the industry puts at $500 million per drug, a figure some say is inflated.</p>
        <p>What's more, there is no one set price for drugs. Consumer advocates often complain that Americans pay higher prices for their prescriptions than patients anywhere else in the world. And that is true -- if the patient pays the retail price, out of pocket. (That is the case for nearly one-third of the elderly, who have health insurance through Medicare but lack drug coverage.)</p>
        <p>BUT the truth is, few people buy retail in this business. Most have insurance, and their health care providers typically negotiate discounts with the drug manufacturers. The size of these discounts, however, is a well-kept secret. The drug makers would like to keep it that way, which is one reason they are working hard to defeat any legislation that would put Medicare in charge of running a benefits plan.</p>
        <p>''They are totally paranoid about price controls, but I think the thing that scares them more than anything is public disclosure of what people actually pay for prescriptions,'' said Bruce C. Vladeck, a former administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare. ''They go to enormous lengths not just to keep that information confidential, but to actually obscure it.''</p>
        <p>A government-run drug benefit plan would change that. If private insurers offered drug benefits, the pharmaceutical industry could continue to negotiate behind closed doors. But Medicare would publish what it pays for drugs, and the private sector would undoubtedly demand similar discounts. And with every senior citizen in the nation enrolled in the same Medicare drug plan, the government's bargaining clout would increase exponentially.</p>
        <p>''Medicare is the big gorilla,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University. ''But there is another fear: If you go to bed with a gorilla, and the gorilla shifts, you get squashed.''</p>
        <p>The shifting gorilla, of course, is Congress; the drug industry fears lawmakers will agree to pay for a Medicare prescription drugs benefit now, in times of surplus, and then cut back on reimbursements when money grows scarce.</p>
        <p>That is precisely what has happened with the 35-year-old Medicare program itself. In its early years, said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare became ''the largest single cash cow for doctors and hospitals around the country.''  But amid concerns over rising health care costs in the 1990's, Medicare lowered reimbursements, and now health providers are struggling.</p>
        <p>Some experts, including Dr. Altman, argue that even with the cutbacks, doctors are better off with Medicare than without it. Dr. Reinhardt calculates the same would be true of the drug makers: a Medicare benefits plan might bring lower prices, he says, but the industry would make up the difference in volume.</p>
        <p>But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, disagrees. The drug industry consistently ranks as the most profitable on the list of Fortune 500 companies. Yet Mr. Holmer warns that lower prices would ''put biomedical innovation at risk'' by cutting into profits that the drug makers need to plow back into research.</p>
        <p>''The industry could be profoundly different,'' said Mr. Holmer, whose two children have cystic fibrosis and have benefited from new treatments for that disease, he said. ''One of the most frightening things is that if we were to proceed down that path, we would never really know which cure we were denied.''</p>
        <p>In one sense, Mr. Holmer's industry is a victim of its own success. ''We have the best medical armamentarium in the world,'' said Dr. Kessler, the former F.D.A. commissioner. ''But what good is it if people can't afford it?''</p>
        <p>BECAUSE other countries have drug price controls, the pharmaceutical industry earns most of its profits, and conducts most of its basic research, in the United States. ''We Americans fund the bulk of the research for the rest of the world,'' Dr. Reinhardt said, ''so everyone else can mooch.''</p>
        <p>And because prices are higher here, Americans use their prescription drugs sparingly. Even so, drugs have become an essential part of American medical care. ''I have some patients that are choosing between food and travel to see their children or grandchildren'' or taking pills, said Dr. Diane E. Meier, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.</p>
        <p>Many experts are doubtful that Congress will move on drug prices this year. While the House Republican bill calls for private insurers to offer drug benefits, the insurers themselves are against it; they say that even with government subsidies, the plans would be too costly to offer. At the same time, Republicans and Democrats may not be able to bridge their ideological gap. In the meantime, says Dr. Vladeck, the industry will continue to draw its line in the sand. ''The United States is their safety valve in terms of profits,'' he said. ''I think that adds intensity to their feelings about this. They are running out of places where they can charge whatever they want.''</p>
