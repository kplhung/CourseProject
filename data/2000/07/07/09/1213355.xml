        <p>The Hotel Savoy in Florence has reopened after an extensive two-year restoration aimed at upgrading its amenities while maintaining its elegance. In the central Piazza della Repubblica, once part of the city's Jewish neighborhood, the Savoy was built in 1893 as the offices of an Israeli banker. Soon after it was completed, it was sold, and the new owners transformed it into a hotel that quickly became a favorite of the aristocracy. This is the third time the hotel has been completely restored; in 1958, a fifth floor was added, providing panoramic views of nearby monuments, such as the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore and Giotto's Campanile.</p>
        <p>The hotel, part of the RF Hotels chain, has 98 rooms and nine suites, each with air-conditioning, two-line telephones, voice messaging and interactive satellite television that keeps an account of your bill day by day and also leaves messages for you. The room decor is luxurious but simple, employing rich pastel colored fabrics. Marbles and hand-crafted mosaics decorate the modern baths. The common rooms, some still with the original boiserie, retain a fin-de-siecle, Old World elegance.</p>

        <p>TRAVEL ADVISORY  Correction:  July 23, 2000, Sunday  A report in the Travel Advisory column on July 9 about the reopening of the Savoy Hotel in Florence referred incorrectly to the first occupant of the building. The banker for whom it was built in 1893 was Italian; a news release referred to him as an Israelite because he was Jewish, but Israeli nationality has existed only since 1948.</p>
