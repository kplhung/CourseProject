        <p>Jeff Nelson, the Yankees' reliever, apologized to Torre before yesterday's doubleheader for comments he made Thursday and Friday about Torre's decision to leave him off the American League All-Star team. Nelson acknowledged that he made all the comments attributed to him, but realized, after reading accounts of what he had said, that it had become more of an issue than he expected.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to cause any problems,'' he said. ''I'm not a bad person on the team. I said stupid things, and it wasn't right for me to say them.''</p>
        <p>Nelson said that Torre accepted his apology evenly, and that he now wants the issue to go away.</p>
