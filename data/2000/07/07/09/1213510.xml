        <p>ON behalf of financial planners, academics, investment advisers and self-anointed experts everywhere, I apologize. It appears that much of what you have been told over the last 30 years about the benefits of international diversification has been greatly exaggerated.</p>
        <p>In fact, according to a new study, those benefits are less than half as great as originally thought.</p>
        <p>The case for international diversification, having been tirelessly repeated for decades, is now numbingly familiar -- especially to mutual fund investors, because funds have been the preferred vehicle for achieving low-cost exposure to many foreign equities. By allocating some of an equity portfolio to international stocks, the argument goes, you can reduce risk sharply without having to forfeit returns over the long term.</p>
        <p>Yadda, yadda, yadda. Indeed, diversification has come to be seen as an insurance policy on your portfolio -- and one with no premium to pay.  The linchpin in the argument has always been the supposedly low correlation between market movements in the United States and those in foreign countries. When one of them is zigging, the theory goes, there is a good chance the other is zagging. As a result, a portfolio that combines domestic and international exposure  should be less volatile than one invested in only one or the other.</p>
        <p>It turns out that the linchpin has a major structural defect: the world's major equity markets tend to become highly correlated during major sell-offs. As a result, international diversification falters just as investors need its much-promoted benefits.</p>
        <p>The defect went undetected for many years, and it is easy to see why: when comparing the overall performance histories of United States and foreign markets, the two indeed seem rather uncorrelated.</p>
        <p>The defect becomes evident only when the markets' good and bad months are examined separately. That is the approach used by authors of a new study -- Kirt C. Butler, an associate professor of finance at Michigan State University and the author of ''Multinational Finance,'' a popular college textbook (South-Western Publishing), and Domingo Castelo Joaquin, an assistant professor of finance at Illinois State University.</p>
        <p>To appreciate the importance of their findings, we must first understand how to measure the correlation between two asset classes of any kind. Researchers use what they call a correlation coefficient, a number that ranges from ''+1,'' meaning that the two assets have perfect, or complete, correlation, to ''-1,'' meaning that they have perfect inverse correlation. A coefficient of zero means no correlation whatsoever.</p>
        <p>IF United States and foreign markets tracked each other to the same degree in rising markets as they did in declining markets, the coefficient, of course, would remain the same. But that has not been the case. The professors looked at United States stock market performance, month by month, from January 1970 through June 1999, then divided the results into three categories of equal size: the months in which the market had the biggest relative declines (compared with the previous month); the ''calm'' months, those in which it rose or fell little; and the months in which it rose the most.</p>
        <p>They found that during the months with big declines, the correlation coefficient of American versus foreign stocks was 0.48, more than twice as high as the 0.21 in months with big gains. Only during calm periods was there essentially no correlation.</p>
        <p>In other words, a low correlation between American and foreign equities is generally seen when the market is quiet -- precisely when an investor doesn't need downside protection. And during bearish markets, when an investor most needs that insurance, international diversification provides the least protection.</p>
        <p>Ideally, investors would want the highest correlation during bull markets in American stocks. That is because upside volatility is something to be sought. But even though the correlation is higher in rising markets than in calm ones, it is still less than half that of declining markets.</p>
        <p>Personally, I hope the professors' research makes journalists stop writing about the mysterious failure of international diversification during market corrections. Such reports have been all too predictable in the last decade. The professors' findings don't mean that geographical diversification is without merit -- only that it is not the free lunch that has long been advertised.</p>
        <p>So what does all this mean for investors who diversify internationally? More risk, for one thing. Because world equities have turned out to be more highly correlated in bear markets than experts had believed, internationally diversified portfolios have been far more volatile than predicted. That leads to much lower risk-adjusted performance for such portfolios -- more than 50 percent lower, in fact, according to the professors' calculations of the Sharpe Ratio, which relates performance to volatility.</p>
        <p>That poses a problem for investors: If they still want to achieve the risk reduction they thought they were getting through international diversification, they must forfeit a chunk of their expected profits. In other words, what used to look like a free insurance policy turns out to carry a hefty premium.</p>
        <p>Conversely, if investors don't want to reduce their expected returns, they will have to incur significantly more risk than they previously thought.</p>
        <p>The professors' findings do not justify the elimination of international diversification. The approach still makes sense, but with reduced expectations.</p>
        <p>The study should also have the effect of shifting the optimal portfolio allocations among various foreign markets. That is because different national markets are correlated to different degrees in down markets.</p>
        <p>By this measure, allocations should be reduced most in Germany and Japan -- markets that are most correlated to that of the United States during sell-offs. For a more complete list of the bear-market correlations, investors can see the study at Professor Butler's Web site at http://courses.bus.msu.edu/fi/ fi860/.</p>
