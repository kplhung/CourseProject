        <p>COLLEGE students who share their music files on the Internet have been accused of stealing copyrighted works, or at least of exhibiting questionable morality. Ask the students in a liberal college town like this one and they will beg to differ. The dark truth, they say, is that they've been driven to Napster or Scour Exchange by a global conspiracy arrayed against them.</p>
        <p>By the tens of thousands, they have joined services like these, through which they can get new music free, rather than having to go to the record store -- which would entail the nasty hurdle of having to pay money. But the real reason they're sharing files, they say, is that they've been forced to.</p>
        <p>''If you're looking for someone to blame, blame the universities,'' said Amna Suharwardy, 19, who attended summer classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Her point is that the universities give students high-speed Internet connections that make it so easy to download free music that they'd be inexcusably dense not to take the bait.</p>
        <p>But there is more to the conspiracy than just the enablers in the administration building. The students say the record industry itself is driving them to subversion.</p>
        <p>Stephan Goyne, 24, a new graduate of the University of California at Santa Cruz, said he had seen through the industry's clever little ruse:  greedy record companies have been trying to make money. He has taken to Napster to fight back. ''Music should be made for the sake of music -- it should be free,'' said Mr. Goyne, 24, who specifically wants to liberate the music of Willie Nelson.</p>
        <p>He's not an extremist, mind you. For him, the principle of people sharing stuff has limits. ''No, you can't have my shoes,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Napster users generally agree with him on the limits thing, but the difference with music is that it's, well, music, and charging money for Metallica's ''Kill 'Em All'' is like depriving them of a basic human need.</p>
        <p>''Come on -- $15? Some people can't afford a CD,'' said Mario Garcia, a Berkeley junior who uses Napster to download tracks of Metallica and Rage Against the Machine. He would be willing to pay for the music if he had a job, but that would turn the priorities of a modern society on their head. ''What do they want more -- for me to have a job and money, or stay in school?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''I guess you could borrow my toaster, but only if you return it,'' he added, walking away briskly, careful not to turn his back.</p>
        <p>On Telegraph Avenue, John Vance, a Napster user, runs the ''1st Amendment Center'' -- several portable shelves from which he sells bumper stickers like ''Robin Hood Was Right'' and ''I Do Whatever My Rice Krispies Tell Me to Do.'' Mr. Vance, 57, said it was unfortunate that Napster users had been entrapped into downloading music.</p>
        <p>''Hey, as long as technology is provided by The Corporation -- you know what I'm saying, The Corporation! -- people are going to use it,'' he said. ''It's like putting $100 on the sidewalk -- people are going to take it. They can make a criminal of anybody.''</p>
        <p>His Rice Krispies told him to sell the bumper stickers for $2 each. He said he hoped The Corporation never comes up with a way to share bumper stickers on the Web. ''I'd have to do something else,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He is not a college student, but he's in tune with their thinking, and what they are thinking is: Please, people, see the straits we're in. Record companies charge too much, The Corporation makes the tools and universities complete the unholy axis, forcing bandwidth on the poor souls that society deems must get a degree.</p>
        <p>STILL, said Mr. Goyne, the recent graduate, the whole conversation has gotten him thinking. If college students and other poor folks don't pay for records, he observed, then the record industry could start to fail, which could lead to layoffs of ordinary workers, like record store clerks and people who work in factories that make compact discs.</p>
        <p>And upon reflection, maybe he does think musicians should be able to make a profit. He just thinks that the profit should be limited, and that musicians should perform for the love of their craft.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I am against it. I don't know,'' he said of the Napster service. ''I hadn't really thought about it.</p>
        <p>''But you still can't have my shoes,'' he said. ''Don't even bring that up again.''</p>
