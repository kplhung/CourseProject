        <p>Cleve Overton, 71, Staten Island artist who is black, is joined by local NAACP chapter in campaign to have mural depicting island's history in lobby of Staten Island Borough Hall, painted in mid-1930's by Frederick C Stahr for Works Progress Adminisration, removed; one panel depicts sorrowful, barefoot black boy amid crowd of white citizens greeting island's first steam locomotive; alternatives to removal discussed; photo (M)</p>

        <p>An image of a barefoot black boy sits in the lower left corner of a mural in the lobby of Staten Island Borough Hall. The boy occupies an obscure spot in one of 13 painted scenes that depict Staten Island's history.

        <p>Cleve Overton, an artist with roots in Staten Island, says the boy, who is the only clearly black figure in the murals, conveys a defeated spirit and is thus a kind of visual slur.

        <p>An image of a barefoot black boy sits in the lower left corner of a mural in the lobby of Staten Island Borough Hall. The boy occupies an obscure spot in one of 13 painted scenes that depict Staten Island's history. But he is center stage in a controversy about whether the image trivializes African-Americans and their role in local history.</p>
        <p>Cleve Overton, an artist with roots in Staten Island, says the boy, who is the only clearly black figure in the murals, conveys a defeated spirit and is thus a kind of visual slur. ''He's just sitting there looking like a Negro,'' Mr. Overton said. ''Like he's thinking, 'I ain't really worth much.' ''</p>
        <p>The boy's glum look contrasts starkly with the celebratory tone of the 12-foot by 7-foot painting, which depicts a top hat- and bonnet-wearing crowd of white citizens gathering in 1860 to greet the island's first steam locomotive. Indeed, to some, he strikes the only sorrowful note in the series of panels, which were painted by Frederick C. Stahr for the federal Works Progress Administration in the mid-30's. Stahr died in 1946.</p>
        <p>Mr. Overton, 71, who is black, said he first took offense at the painting when he saw it 30 years ago. ''But I felt that I had no right to object,'' he said, because he was not trained as a historian, His feeling changed last month, when an art restorer began to strip grime from the murals, and their renewed vividness reawakened his discomfort. It was then that Mr. Overton, joined by the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., started campaigning to have the works removed. In letters to elected officials and in leaflets he distributed outside Borough Hall, he says the murals should be replaced by ''less demeaning and more historically accurate'' paintings that would show, for example, some of the hundreds of black oystermen who lived and worked on Staten Island in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The cleaning is part of a $700,000 restoration of Borough Hall's lobby.</p>
        <p>Borough President Guy V. Molinari said he plans to discuss the controversial image with city officials and civic leaders and decide whether it is inappropriate for a public space. That could lead to the removal of all 13 panels.</p>
        <p>''If this mural is deemed offensive,'' said Jennifer Nelson, a spokeswoman for the borough president, ''how in good conscience can we have any of the artist's works?''</p>
        <p>Dick Dickenson, Staten Island's historian,  said the murals, while flawed, are nonetheless historic artifacts and should remain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickenson, who is black, maintained that it was ''cultural tyranny'' to judge works from the past by current standards. ''If we eliminate paintings that we don't like, that aren't sensitive enough to certain groups, in this case being black groups, we don't know where it will stop,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickenson said new paintings depicting local black history could be placed in six arched panels over doorways in the lobby, where Mr. Stahr originally planned to place more murals. He also suggested that signs criticizing aspects of the murals could be installed in Borough Hall.</p>
