        <p>The Black Swan</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Jerome Charyn.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 182 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $21.95.</p>
        <p>A nyone looking back over the last century can mark the progressive enfeeblement of the literary imagination by comparing the best novels of its first half, incontestably ''Ulysses'' and ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' with those of its second -- perhaps ''Midnight's Children,'' perhaps ''Lolita.'' The nadir of the decline seems to be occurring at the century's turn, with the concomitant rise of memoir. Out of the contemporary parade of alcoholic mothers, abusive fathers, over- and undereating and flesh that has been mutilated, mortified and indulged, Jerome Charyn's ''Black Swan'' steps forth as a robust and instructive exception. The second of two volumes to deal with his childhood in the Bronx of the 1940's, this book is no more able to shed its roots in fiction -- Charyn is the author of 26 earlier novels -- than a similarly entrenched evergreen can its leaves.</p>
        <p>Let me give an example from the first volume, the delightful and engaging ''Dark Lady From Belorusse,'' which focuses on the relationship of Baby Charyn with his mother, Faigele. Throughout that book, and the second memoir too, she is described as a woman of near-otherworldly beauty: all eyes turn as she walks down the street, all manner of men throw themselves upon her, and the ripple of adoration she stirs in the linked world of politics and crime reaches all the way to F.D.R. and, more impressively, to Meyer Lansky himself. As it happens, the author chose to include several photographs of the Dark Lady in the text, and what we see is not ''Joan Crawford's twin'' but -- forgive me, Mr. Charyn -- a pleasant, wide-cheeked, high-browed woman, much like many another. Nonetheless, such is the intensity of the adult Jerome's conviction, so great the powers of his prose and his belief in his own fantasy, that I remain convinced that next to Fanny Charyn, Helen of Troy must look like Orrin Hatch. Those photographs, along with all facts attendant to them, are washed out by the 500-watt bulb of the projectionist's imagination: what we truly believe are the larger-than-life figures, Faigele among them, cast upon the mental screen before us.</p>
        <p>I have chosen this image with care, since movies are a minor theme throughout ''The Black Swan,'' and the Luxor, the theater in which Baby plays hooky week after week, is a major one. It is there that he sees endless reruns of ''Samson and Delilah'' and ''Twelve</p>
        <p>O'Clock High,'' and there that he meets the three owners of the little movie house -- Everett Darling, Luke Goldberg and Murray Bell -- who will change his life. These three, who had flunked out of Harvard -- one a conscientious objector, another with a hole in his heart, the third a cross-dresser fond of boys -- have spent the war hiding out in the Luxor. That makes four hooky players, all of whom take off together in a series of adventures that make up the bulk of the book.</p>
        <p>What follows is not so much a plot as a series of portraits -- affecting ones of a fireman of whom Murray has become desperately enamored, and of Baby's school probation officer, Miss de Winter, the first great love of his life. But most of the people young Jerome meets are politicians and gangsters, like King Farouk, ne Fatso Levine, who won the Medal of Honor at Corregidor and who now controls the celery tonic cartel from his headquarters in the Chesterfield Cafeteria; or Tyrone Wood, Farouk's black bodyguard but in fact a bit of a king himself in the Negro wards of the Bronx. Baby serves as Farouk's bagman and Tyrone's accomplice, activities that lead to arrests, beatings, even murder. Insofar as this plot has strings they are pulled offstage, and off page, by Meyer Lansky. It is the Little Man who eventually gathers all the characters, Baby and his family, Farouk, the three owners of the Luxor and even the bumped-off Tyrone for a somewhat improbable climax in his Catskills resort, the Black Swan.</p>
        <p>The true model for this memoir is at least as much the Odessa of Isaac Babel as the Bronx of the author's youth. There is the same thick ethnic atmosphere and sense of place; the same Jewish gangsters, a cast, as Charyn calls them, of mongrels and outlaws; the same dynamic of extortion and loyalty. Above all there is the same language, humorous, short-phrased, ironic and elegant, that can only be called haut-Yiddish, whether the actual words come from blacks, Jews or, as in the following example, a hillbilly cop, a mob lawyer and an Irish pol:</p>
        <p>'' 'Where's that Faigele, Mrs. Fannie?' he snarled.</p>
        <p>'' 'In Catskill heaven,' Stanislaus said. He wasn't frightened of a country sheriff.</p>
        <p>'' 'Then I'll have to knock on heaven's door,' said Billy Trumps. . . .</p>
        <p>'' 'Do you know who I am?' asked Fred R. Lions, his fingers shaking. 'Bronx borough president and a Democratic Party chief.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Then it will be a pleasure, sir, leading you to jail.' ''</p>
        <p>It is no small achievement to be the Babel of the Bronx. After so many novels, Charyn has in these two memoirs (which his publishers surely should have brought out as one) found his true subject and his true voice. I am happy for him and for the many readers who will take pleasure in what I suspect is his finest piece of fiction.</p>
        <p>Leslie Epstein's most recent novels are ''Ice Fire Water'' and ''Pandaemonium.''</p>
