        <p>NATASHA LYONNE sat on a bench outside a coffee bar near her Gramercy Park studio apartment last Tuesday, shuddering slightly even in the 90-degree heat. She was detoxing from Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to breakfast,'' said the 21-year-old actress whose quirky performances in ''Slums of Beverly Hills,'' ''American Pie'' and ''But I'm a Cheerleader,'' which opened this weekend, have marked her as the New York doppelganger of such plump-lipped ingenues as Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt, a sort of antistarlet. She lifted a large iced coffee to go and took a deep drag of a cigarette. Her voice was throaty, her tone ironic: ''Real movie star stuff here, real glamour.''</p>

        <p>NATASHA LYONNE sat on a bench outside a coffee bar near her Gramercy Park studio apartment last Tuesday, shuddering slightly even in the 90-degree heat. She was detoxing from Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to breakfast,'' said the 21-year-old actress whose quirky performances in ''Slums of Beverly Hills,'' ''American Pie'' and ''But I'm a Cheerleader,'' which opened this weekend, have marked her as the New York doppelganger of such plump-lipped ingenues as Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt, a sort of antistarlet. She lifted a large iced coffee to go and took a deep drag of a cigarette. Her voice was throaty, her tone ironic: ''Real movie star stuff here, real glamour.''</p>
        <p>Like most people in her profession Ms. Lyonne spends much of her time working in Los Angeles, but it takes a lot of imagination to picture her tooling down Rodeo Drive in a BMW convertible or lolling in the Hollywood Hills. Although she is only 5-foot-3 and waifish (the huge breasts she sported as the focus of the comedy in ''Slums of Beverly Hills'' were prosthetics), she walks like a truck driver. And swears like one, too. Between drags of her cigarette (she carries both Marlboros and Camel Lights because she ''likes to switch off''), her monologues tumble out in a side-of-the-mouth stream of consciousness. Her references careen from Ionesco to patent leather G-strings. ''Sometimes the things that come out of my mouth are mortifying,'' she conceded.</p>
        <p>Despite her cultivated toughness, Ms. Lyonne's latest obsession is ''being a lady.'' She is tired of her old punk wardrobe of black fishnets and leather. To prove it, she was wearing a Jill Stuart halter dress in demure shades of brown. Ms. Stuart gave her the dress to wear to a star-studded AIDS benefit in Manhattan the night before. It set off Ms. Lyonne's eyes, which are huge beneath soft spidery lashes. To complete the genteel image, she was now carrying a big off-white fake alligator purse that she picked up for $2 at the 26th Street flea market. ''I used to go to the airport in fishnets and combat boots and kids would call me Herman Munster,'' she recalled. ''That wasn't so great.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Lyonne hasn't traded in her Doc Martens for the haute vintage look now popular with many young women in the East Village. ''I'm so over polyester,'' she said. Nor does she cotton to the ''floraly'' sundresses that seem to be the uniform for her actress peers in Hollywood. ''I prefer to look like that but gone a little wrong. I'd rather confuse people.'' (In keeping with the spirit of confusion, she has paired Ms. Stuart's dress with gold lame platform sandals from Frederick's of Hollywood.) Ms. Lyonne insisted she was sincere about giving herself a full-fledged fashion makeover. In fact, she wanted to start that very minute. After a final cigarette, she clumped off to Ferragamo, where she had read in the paper there was a sale. ''Now that is a ladylike place, I'll bet,'' she said, hailing a cab.</p>
        <p>Once uptown, her expression grew a bit worried. Standing outside the massive glass doors of the venerable shoe store, she looked like a lost child. ''Okay, men, I'm going in,'' she deadpanned to an invisible Army brigade. The first thing that caught her eye was a piece of luggage. She turned pale when the saleswoman told her it cost $1,000. ''See, it rolls,'' the woman added, cheerily. ''Oh, that makes all the difference,'' Ms. Lyonne said, moving on.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lyonne wandered over to survey the spectator pumps, considering for a moment whether the matronly two-toned shoe might have camp potential, but the impulse lasted only a moment. ''Even I am not this crazy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After perusing a pair of $1,250 alligator stilettos, she asked for a lady's room. A reproving salesman told her that the store's restrooms were out of order. He suggested she go down the street to Burger Heaven. ''O.K.,'' she said under her breath with a theatrical scowl. ''So why don't you just say, like: 'Get out of here, you can't afford these things. Go back downtown, you loser.' ''</p>
        <p>Despite her grumbling during the trek to Burger Heaven, Ms. Lyonne actually seemed perfectly happy playing the outsider. In two recent roles, ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' and HBO's ''If These Walls Could Talk 2'' she has played a lesbian, a stretch she shrugs off. ''It's no big deal,'' said Ms. Lyonne, who like many of her Hollywood peers thinks such concerns are dated. ''To me it's about as controversial as the interracial stuff in 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.' ''</p>
        <p>She comes by such off-hand bohemianism honestly. Her mother was the European-educated daughter of Holocaust survivors. She describes her father as a bit of a shady character from Brooklyn. ''It was unclear what my parents did for a living,'' she said. ''They were the black sheeps of Auschwitz and Flatbush.''</p>
        <p>She spent the first eight years of her life in Great Neck, where she and her family lived in Herman Melville's old house. They kept a sheep on the rambling property, until one day it ''just exploded.'' ''I had a rabbit that exploded, too,'' she added. ''Things like that happened to us. We were very weird.''</p>
        <p>The family moved to Israel, where Natasha's father became a boxing promoter. Her parents' marriage broke up soon after, and her mother brought her and her older brother to Manhattan. She has not heard from her father since. Her grandmother offered to pick up the cost of private school, but only if Natasha went to a yeshiva.</p>
        <p>She didn't fit in and ''got kicked out pretty easily,'' she said, adding that she also got kicked out of army summer camp in Israel when she was 15. ''I was wild. I broke a whole bunch of kids out of the barracks in a covert nighttime maneuver. I was like Bette Davis on crank.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lyonne got cast by Woody Allen in ''Everyone Says I Love You,'' when she was 16, a fact she recalled wistfully as she passed the fortress-like Fifth Avenue headquarters of Harry Winston where one of the film's musical numbers was shot. ''We could go in and just say hi,'' she said brightly, as she glanced at the ornate gates and improvised a little Fred Astaire glide. Then she got a bit embarrassed over her own enthusiasm. ''Or maybe not.''</p>
        <p>It was the paycheck from ''Everyone'' that enabled her to buy the small apartment near Gramercy Park when she was 18. She has been financially independent ever since. For the last year, she has been dating Edward Furlong, another young actor, who works mostly in independent films. (After shopping, she planned to go to the airport -- no ticket yet -- and hop a plane for Rome, where Mr. Furlong is working.)</p>
        <p>Because her talents have been so much in demand lately, Ms. Lyonne has put off going to college, though she was accepted at her first choice, New York University. (In her entrance essay she compared working with Mr. Allen to T. S. Eliot's ''Wasteland''). But part of her longs to join the brainy set of young actors that includes the Yale student Clare Danes and Natalie Portman, who is at Harvard.</p>
        <p>''I'm pretty good with ideas,'' she said, ''and that life really appeals to me.'' Unlike those actors, she has not made enough money to retire on. For her, $30,000 a year tuition would be a wipeout. ''I could ask my grandmother for the money but I really have this thing about being independent.''</p>
        <p>By 2 p.m., Ms. Lyonne had become disillusioned with the relentless ladylikeness of Fifth Avenue. ''Let's go somewhere less phony,'' she said, after a browse through Fendi, where she just shook her head at the price of the elaborately beaded accessories.</p>
        <p>She opted for a cab ride back downtown, to Ina, the designer resale shop in NoLIta. ''This is more my speed,'' she said, trying on a $100 pair of pink Prada hot pants. ''Though even these are still overpriced, I think.''</p>
        <p>In the end, she wound up with a straw fedora -- no fancy label. ''In my line of work you need something to keep the sun out of your eyes,'' she said, sounding as though she worked construction instead of movies. She glanced at herself in the store window. ''It's a look. It's not Ferragamo, but it's a look.''</p>
