        <p>Performing arts organizations come in all sizes, and so do the financial packages that help keep them going.</p>
        <p>For the Yorktown Theater, it's a rent break that adds up to $6,000 a year.</p>
        <p>For Caramoor, it's a successful multimillion-dollar capital campaign to maintain and restore its grounds, pictured above at right. At the recent opening of the 55th International Music Festival, Caramoor's executive director, Howard Herring, announced that Caramoor had raised $7.5 million, with more commitments expected. When the campaign reached its original $7 million goal, Caramoor qualified for a matching grant of $700,000 from the Kresge Foundation, which gives money to arts-related capital projects. The money raised will be divided, with $4 million going to the building program and the rest going into the endowment.</p>
