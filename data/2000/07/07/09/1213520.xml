        <p>THE first windows were holes in the walls that allowed an exchange of stagnant interior air with fresh outdoor air. Since they also allowed heat to escape they were probably small and covered with cloth, reed mats or leather. With the introduction of glass panes, windows became larger to let light in and provide a view. These windows had to be custom made for each house. Yet they were not well sealed, and they let cold drafts inside during the winter months. Still a window was a valuable commodity and in Colonial times, homeowners would remove their windows and take them along when they moved to a new house.</p>
        <p>Today, windows are mass produced from durable weather-resistant materials. They come in a variety of styles and sizes. This makes it easy to replace a worn, outmoded window when it starts to deteriorate or change to a more stylish window when you want to remodel.</p>
        <p>If you are simply replacing an old window, then you will probably choose a new window of the same style, size and shape. If, however, you are remodeling, then there are other options you may want to consider.</p>
        <p>You could, for example, reposition a window to reflect the daylight that is coming into the room. Do this by moving the window closer to an adjacent perpendicular wall. The wall then becomes a reflector that bounces the light at a different angle from the incoming rays of the sun. This brightens the room by removing shadows and at the same time tends to diminish the difference between the interior and exterior, thus creating the illusion of a larger living space.</p>
        <p>In contrast, if you move the window away from the adjacent wall, less light is reflected and a dark area develops in the corner. This creates a cooler, more subdued atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The size of windows can also affect the mood of the interior. Large windows in a room admit a lot of light, provide a view of the outside and brighten a room. But overly large windows may offer too much of a good thing. They can create a feeling of agoraphobia and destroy the intimacy of the room. It's best to install large windows in sunrooms and activity rooms, and smaller windows in libraries, dens and formal dining rooms.</p>
        <p>You can also group different size windows into an overall composition that becomes the focal point in a room. One large window can have a row of smaller windows on either side; or a rectangular window frame may be topped with a semi-circular fan window. Beware of having too many window combinations around the house. It is best to place a single large window composition in the main room and use similar but smaller patterns in the other rooms.</p>
        <p>If you decide to replace your old windows with new ones, you may be surprised at number of options available. First there are five basic window styles to choose from: double hung, casement, awning, gliding and fixed.</p>
        <p>The double-hung window is still the most popular style. It consists of two sashes that slide up and down in a frame. Casement windows have sashes that are hinged at the top and bottom. They swing out (like a door) by means of a crank mechanism. Awning windows have sashes that are hinged at the top. They swing outward from the bottom and when open resemble a storefront awning. Gliding windows contain two sashes that slide horizontally in tracks in the frame. Fixed windows cannot open and are installed to provide a view (like picture windows) or as decorative accents (like oval or circular windows).</p>
        <p>Besides selecting a style, you will want to choose windows that are durable and resistant to the onslaughts of the weather. Windows with metal frames are especially rugged, but some homeowners find they lack the warmth and elegance of wood frames. Many manufacturers offer windows made of wood but with exterior surfaces clad in maintenance-free vinyl or aluminum. Aluminum- or vinyl-clad windows will cost more than windows made of wood, but they will help save time and money that would be used later to scrape and repaint wooden sashes.</p>
        <p>Modern windows are more energy efficient than older windows. In the past, no matter how well the sashes were sealed around the jambs, some heat was lost through the glass. Now manufacturers offer windows with thermal panes -- essentially an envelope of glass -- filled with inert argon gas.</p>
        <p>They also apply a low-E coating to the surface of the glass; it adds even more insulation value to the window. The low-E coating acts like an invisible two-sided mirror that reflects heat in either direction. During the summer, it reflects the hot rays from sun to keep them from entering the house. In the winter, the glass contains the house heat and helps keep fuel bills down.</p>
