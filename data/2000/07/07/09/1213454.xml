        <p>WHEN a highway fatality takes place, people don't think twice about leaving a white cross, a bouquet of flowers or other memorabilia at the site of the crash.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, however, the memorial takes on a life of its own, with friends and family constantly feeding it. That is when the Connecticut Department of Transportation maintenance employees begin to feel like they are fighting a losing battle.</p>
        <p>Doug Novack, manager of Special Services for the D.O.T. in Thomaston, remembers when a mother and her two children, Ann Avery and Elizabeth and Geoffrey, were killed at a dangerous intersection in Harwinton in 1997. ''We brought in a nine-ton dump truck and hauled away a truckload of flowers,'' he said. ''After about 10 days, we asked the friends and family to stop, but for two or three weeks after that we were still cleaning up.''</p>
        <p>The situation was one of many in the state that caused the D.O.T. to recently re-issue a press release, sent to all police stations, asking for the public's cooperation in refraining from such memorials and the local police's assistance in notifying the D.O.T. of hazards.</p>
        <p>''You get gawkers, people stopping in the middle of the road and getting out of their cars to deliver flowers,'' Mr. Novack said. ''If families want to do this kind of thing then we'd like to pick a safe area for them.''</p>
        <p>There is no specific law governing roadside memorials, but there is legislation for illegal signs within the state's right-of-way, something which gives clout to the press-release request for compliance.</p>
        <p>''When I see a roadside memorial, I contact the local maintenance garage, they take it away,'' said Stephen T. Cochran, director of maintenance for the D.O.T. ''We take everything back to the garage and try to find out who it belongs to. We try to show as much respect to families as possible. I know it's a tough time for people, but lots of people stop to look, and we must remove memorials for the safety of everybody.''</p>
        <p>The release requesting no memorials was originally sent out in 1995. However, about four months ago a Middletown police officer was killed in an accident on Route 9 in Haddam, and that incident, coupled with increasing numbers of memorials, caused to the D.O.T. to send the release to police stations across the state, asking them to notify the D.O.T. of any infringements.</p>
        <p>''Someone painted a tree on Route 9, near the site of the crash, and we eventually had to cover it with brown paint,'' said Michael Turano, the transportation maintenance director at the D.O.T.'s Newington Headquarters. ''It was very distracting to motorists. Finally we named a street after him, but the whole thing triggered the re-issue of this press release.''</p>
        <p>When a 17-year-old New Milford girl, Angela D'Aquila, was struck and killed by a New Milford Police officer responding to call in 1998, her friends rallied to mark the site. Deanna Arnoldt, a classmate of Miss D'Aquila, gathered her sister, her classmates and friends, got the shop teacher at New Milford High School to build a cross. ''We had pictures, candles, photo albums, angels, a memory box and a little journal so friends could write notes to Angela,'' Ms. Arnoldt explained. ''Every day, when I drove by, I remembered her. It wasn't a distraction for anyone and it was inappropriate to take it away.''</p>
        <p>The preferred solution to such memorials, according to Mr. Novack, is something like an ''adopt a highway'' program that allowed friends and family to erect a sign and then maintain that stretch of highway with litter pick-ups four times a year.</p>
        <p>When people decide to adopt a highway in memory of someone, the fee for the permit is waived, according to Mr. Turano. However, they must purchase at least $500,000 in liability insurance, usually through the town, which releases the D.O.T. from responsibility for their safety while on the roadside. One insurance company estimated the insurance would cost about $500.</p>
        <p>''We don't want flowers, we don't want crosses with flowers, or perpetual candles,'' Mr. Novack said. ''We don't want a motorist to go by and be distracted.''</p>
        <p>When a young police officer, Christopher Bannerman of Canton, was killed in an on-duty crash in 1997, pictures of the officer appeared up and down the Route 202 just north of New Hartford on fence posts. ''There were flowers everywhere,'' Mr. Novack said.</p>
        <p>Highway maintenance workers were concerned about the distractions, but negotiations between the D.O.T., the attorney general, the family and the town of New Hartford resulted finally in a sign posted near the site that says ''Family and Friends of Christopher Bannerman.'' They also adopted a stretch of highway and have clean-ups four times a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turano said roadside memorials are a frequent topic of discussion among workers throughout the state.</p>
        <p>''This has caused issues, creates a safety concern,'' Mr. Turano said, ''and through whatever reasons people have died at a site, their friends and family are now putting others at risk.''</p>
        <p>The custom began to create problems about four or five years ago, he added, when people started putting up crosses, approximately 2 feet tall. ''Now it's complete shrines and it's getting out of hand,'' Mr. Turano said.</p>
        <p>The D.O.T.'s release states: ''In the interest of highway safety, the state Department of Transportation is requesting Connecticut residents to refrain from placing roadside memorials at fatal accident sites along state highway right-of-ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turano said people placing the memorials are themselves at risk.</p>
        <p>''Our employees aren't allowed on the highway without safety gear,'' he said. ''And here you have people on the road with no protection whatsoever. When a new memorial goes out, we let it stay a couple weeks before we remove it. Then, on the anniversary of the death, another one may appear.''</p>
        <p>Angela D'Aquila's memorial has since disappeared and all that remains is the tiny picket fence that surrounded a garden. ''Last year, on the anniversary of her death, we gathered, about 15 or 20 of us, to say a prayer,'' Ms. Arnoldt said. ''Then someone sent her mother notice that it all had to come down. I was away at college when I heard that, I was swearing; this is something so personal. We go to her grave to mourn her, but this site was by the high school and it gave me strength to see it there. It was my place to remember her.''</p>
        <p>Just down the road from Ms. D'Aquila's garden is another plot, planted in memory of Angel Sanango, a victim of a hit-and-run accident. His body was returned to Ecuador for burial, but his fiancee, brother and sister-in-law remain in town and consider their roadside memorial the only alternative to visiting Mr. Sanango's grave. It remains neat and tidy, and, for now, untouched by D.O.T. workers.</p>
        <p>''Other states have certain specifications about this,'' Mr. Turano added. ''California bans memorials outright while Illinois officials discourage them. I've had e-mails, and public disagreements regarding the policy.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Maguire, mayor's aide in New Milford, noted that some roadside memorials are tasteful and some are not. ''There was a recent death in New Fairfield and there are flowers all over,'' he said. ''In Europe, wherever an accident occurred, they put up signs, in Ireland, big black dots. Memorials can be a wake-up call, but they can also create another accident. The memorials to Angel and Angela are on a straight-of-way and at one site, there were people gathering and it was truly a distraction. My concern is safety. If the D.O.T. says it's O.K., fine, but in most cases, it's their property and they can decide.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maguire said that some memorials had cropped up that could create another mishap. ''Usually it's friends,'' he said. ''I don't know if family members could do this. I've never been in this situation, but maintaining a roadside memorial would bring back so many memories that I don't know if I could do it all.''</p>
