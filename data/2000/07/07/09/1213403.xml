        <p>I WENT to Colonial Williamsburg not long ago. It was Garden Week in Virginia, and, like thousands of my fellow enthusiasts, I was eager to see some of the extraordinary private gardens that were open for the festivities. I also wanted to find out what a 21st-century Northeastern gardener can learn from gardens that have been recreated over the past 60 years to resemble those that existed in 18th-century Virginia.</p>
        <p>I am not the only one with such interests. Historic gardens are very hot right now. Expensive subdivisions seem to be full of people willing to spend vast sums of money to adorn the grounds of their new McMansions with everything from Victorian bedding-out schemes to French parterres.</p>

        <p>I WENT to Colonial Williamsburg not long ago. It was Garden Week in Virginia, and, like thousands of my fellow enthusiasts, I was eager to see some of the extraordinary private gardens that were open for the festivities. I also wanted to find out what a 21st-century Northeastern gardener can learn from gardens that have been recreated over the past 60 years to resemble those that existed in 18th-century Virginia.</p>
        <p>I am not the only one with such interests. Historic gardens are very hot right now. Expensive subdivisions seem to be full of people willing to spend vast sums of money to adorn the grounds of their new McMansions with everything from Victorian bedding-out schemes to French parterres.</p>
        <p>The McMansionites are clearly the spiritual descendants of the colonial governor, Alexander Spotswood, who was convinced that he could create a fashionable watering hole within the confines of a colonial backwater by installing an ornamental water feature at the rear of the governor's mansion. The governor's canal and fishpond have been recreated, and are sited conveniently near another of his innovations, a boxwood maze.  He would undoubtedly be gratified to learn that water features and mazes have become fashionable again.</p>
        <p>But pleasure gardens were not the only gardens flourishing within the colonial capital. Neatly planted symmetrical kitchen gardens, containing combinations of edible plants, herbs, ornamentals and even fruit trees, existed near the homes of working class, professional and wealthy residents. According to Kent Brinkley, director of horticulture for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, it is these gardens that have the most relevance for today's gardeners.</p>
        <p>''Most of the gardens at Colonial Williamsburg are comparable in size to today's home lots,'' he said. ''This helps modern gardeners relate to them in a more intimate way.''  Large estate gardens may be inspiring, added Mr. Brinkley, but it is easier to translate ideas when they are presented on a residential scale.</p>
        <p>Williamsburg's gardens were also full of old-fashioned plant varieties that are identical or at least similar to varieties that were cultivated during the 18th century. Contemporary gardeners are becoming interested in older varieties, and a look at Williamsburg's plant lists can serve as a jumping-off point for selection of specific cultivars for a period bed or garden area. In an era when even the most devoted amateur gardeners are pressed for time, the tough plants favored by colonists merit attention. One example of such toughness, Mr. Brinkley said, is the roses grown in some of colonial gardens.  The plants may not have the largest blossoms, but they are very hardy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned from Williamsburg is also the least tangible. Over the course of the past 15 years, changes in scholarship and developments in landscape archaeology have led Mr. Brinkley and other horticulturists to reexamine the way colonial gardens have been portrayed. The gardens that were reconstructed in the 1930's and 40's when Colonial Williamsburg was a new venture, were Colonial Revival rather than true colonial gardens. The difference between the two is sometimes subtle, according to Mr. Brinkley, but in general the Colonial Revival gardens in the historic area, while presenting an elegant period feel, did not reflect the economic and social status of the colonial-era owners of specific properties. Now, that has become an integral part of garden restoration. ''The use of finely crafted pickets instead of plain boards for fences says something about the status of the owner of a garden,'' Mr. Brinkley said. Personal wealth might also have led a colonial homeowner to install brick walks between garden beds, as opposed to dirt paths covered with a less costly material.</p>
        <p>This emphasis on class distinctions does not please everybody, but it made me feel closer to the original gardeners, many of whom were also busy working people, with gardens that were not necessarily tidy.</p>
        <p>The other lesson that I learned from Mr. Brinkley and the gardens of Williamsburg is that in historic garden recreation, as in any kind of gardening, there is no such thing as being finished. Mr. Brinkley's cited the example of the Taliafero (pronounced toliver) Apple, a variety discovered by the father-in-law of a prominent Williamsburg resident George Wythe and cultivated by Thomas Jefferson. The apple has disappeared from cultivation, but Mr. Brinkley hopes that somewhere, on an abandoned farmstead, a Taliafero apple tree clings to life. If such a tree exists, he looks forward to providing a safe haven for it in Williamsburg, and eventually, returning both the tree and its fruit to commerce.</p>
