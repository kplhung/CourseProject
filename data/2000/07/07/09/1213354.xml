        <p>Bored airline passengers have a new way to help pass the time when they find themselves stuck in an airport because of delays or a long layover.</p>
        <p>They can rent a portable DVD player and watch a movie. Frequent fliers who have seen just about every in-flight movie can watch the film of their choice, and children can be entertained with movies appropriate to their ages.</p>
        <p>InMotion Pictures has opened kiosks in seven airports, where for $10 a day travelers can rent a battery-powered DVD player with movie, headset and extra battery. Additional movies rent for $4 and extra headsets are $2.50.</p>
        <p>The laptop-size DVD players fall under the same in-flight rules that apply to other electronic equipment like computers and cassette players.</p>
        <p>One-way rentals are available if the destination airport has an InMotion kiosk. Multiple-day rentals include additional movies -- one for each day. Travelers with their own portable DVD players or people whose laptop computers have DVD capability can rent just the movie disk for $5 and return the disk by prepaid mailer within five  days.</p>
        <p>About 200 movie titles, including children's films, classics and new releases, are available at InMotion kiosks at the airports in Denver; Minneapolis-St. Paul; Philadelphia; Portland, Ore.; Seattle-Tacoma; San Diego; and San Jose, Calif. The company expects to open in La Guardia Airport as well as in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Orlando, San Francisco and Jacksonville, Fla., within the next several months.</p>
        <p>Movies can be reserved at (877) 383-8646. More information is also available at www.inmotionpictures.com.</p>
