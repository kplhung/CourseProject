        <p>DOROTHEA SEEBER, 93, has always been a little ahead of her time.</p>
        <p>She became a single working mother after her divorce in 1950, when most other women of her generation were comparing Jell-O mold recipes.</p>
        <p>As a businesswoman, Mrs. Seeber became a pioneer in the field of alternative medicine as executive director of the Independent Citizens Research Foundation, which promoted alternative treatment for degenerative diseases.</p>
        <p>And now she is a published author.</p>
        <p>Some 50 years ago, Mrs. Seeber wrote -- but never published -- one of the first upside-down rhyming books for children. It was two stories in one: a tale about a boy who desperately longs for a puppy and a dog without a home who only wants a boy. ''I'd never before seen any upside-down books,'' Mrs. Seeber recalled. ''I just thought it would be a great idea.''</p>
        <p>While working in the subscription department at Reader's Digest, Mrs. Seeber came across a name that she said begged for a rhyme: Lydia B. Twitty. In her book, that name metamorphosed into a line that read, ''Miss Lydia B. Twitty (who lived in the city and kept 22 cats and one little kitty).''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Seeber wrote the manuscript on onion-skin typing paper, glued it onto red construction paper and bound the book with three metal rings. Then the draft sat in a desk drawer for half a century.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Seeber had all but forgotten about her book. Her daughter, the Rev. Sister Laurian Seeber, an Episcopal priest and nun, unearthed the manuscript only a couple of years ago while helping her mother move from a two-family house she shared with a couple, Robert Lindner and Janetta Betz Lindner.</p>
        <p>While the Lindners were visiting her mother one day, Sister Seeber read to them from her mother's crinkled and faded manuscript.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was wonderful,'' Ms. Lindner recalled. ''I told Dorothea I wanted to show the book to an illustrator I knew who was my new neighbor in Hastings.''</p>
        <p>That neighbor happened to be Ed Young, author and illustrator of some 80 children's books and winner of one gold and two silver Caldecott awards, the highest honor for children's book illustrators. The timing couldn't have been better.</p>
        <p>''I'd been approached by my publisher to do an adoption story,'' Mr. Young said. ''I'd never seen a story that was written from both points of view --in this case of a boy who wants a dog and a dog who wants a boy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Young showed the manuscript to his editor at Philomel Books, a division of Penguin Putnam, who was similarly beguiled and approved the project. Mr. Young began work on the art to accompany the text, creating bold paper-collage cutouts that glow luminously against a black background.</p>
        <p>Within a year, ''A Pup Just for Me; a Boy Just for Me'' was completed. Just as Mrs. Seeber originally conceived it, the book can be read from front to back and back to front.</p>
        <p>''It's like a happy bombshell to have this book finally published,'' Mrs. Seeber said in an interview at her home overlooking the Hudson River, her memory aided by her daughter.</p>
        <p>In the original version, Mrs. Seeber intended the reader to read about the boy's longing for a puppy first. At the penultimate moment, as the boy is about to meet his puppy, the author inserted this whimsical note in her original manuscript:</p>
        <p>No peeking here</p>
        <p>My little dear</p>
        <p>To read this right</p>
        <p>Close it up tight</p>
        <p>Now turn the book over</p>
        <p>And read from the back cover!</p>
        <p>The little poem did not make it into the published book, where the only clue indicating which cover is the back of the book is the ISBN number hanging as a tag from the dog's collar. That was Mr. Young's bit of whimsy. ''The ISBN on the back jacket is always an eyesore for me when I design a book,'' Mr. Young said. ''I figured the dog tag could work as an extra hint for the reader.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Seeber and her daughter are preparing to move to Vermont later this summer (Sister Seeber is returning to her parish near Montpelier). Mrs. Seeber has attended small book-signing parties given by neighbors in Hastings and at her church in Irvington, with books signed painstakingly one by one in advance. Her daughter said it takes her mother, who has failing eyesight and hand tremors, nearly an hour to sign each one.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mrs. Seeber was asked if there were any more dusty manuscripts to be discovered. She smiled, her eyes lighting up  mischievously. ''I've been writing for quite a while and only getting published lately,'' she said.</p>
