        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Bernard Holland's astute article ''A Cult of Comparison and a Musical Glut'' [July 2] is so brave and on the mark that I have to write and applaud it. I cannot count how many times I have been to a dinner party of music lovers who play the same work in recording after recording, asking me which is superior. Which singer's high B-flat or which conductor's tempo is more satisfying to a given listener is no basis for a musical culture. Mr. Holland fails to mention, however, that a valid musical culture must include the music of our time. If only we could, as in the old days, listen to a new piece and respond to its relevance to our times, its quality and craftsmanship; then music would regain its position as one of the arts worth discussion, in critiques or in conversation during a concert intermission. Not until the music itself becomes the basis for our musical response will we have a musical culture worth continuing. And then, perhaps, the record companies would feel the need to document an art that is alive and valid.</p>
