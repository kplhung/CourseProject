        <p>REMEMBER junk bonds?</p>
        <p>They were the play stuff of Michael Milken, the mother's milk of the 1980's leveraged-buyout craze and eventually a symbol of that decade's decadence.</p>
        <p>This year, junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds, have posted some of their worst performance in almost a decade. A total of $7.92 billion flowed out of junk-bond funds  from January through May this year, according to estimates by AMG Data Services, a fund tracker in Arcada, Calif. They returned a negative 0.7 percent on average last quarter and negative 1.4 percent over the last 12 months, according to Morningstar Inc. For the five years  through June 30, the funds' average annualized return was just 6.6 percent, only half a percentage point more than long-term government bond funds. So far this year, investors who crave the extra yield of junk are actually worse off than they would have been in Treasuries.</p>
        <p>''We almost feel like an ostracized asset class,'' said Peter Andersen, portfolio manager of the Conseco High Yield fund. The sector's returns have previously fallen two years in a row, he said, but ''now we're entering our third year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''The investor is saying: 'I'd be better off putting my money somewhere else, like a C.D.,' '' he added.</p>
        <p>Problems arose for junk bonds in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, as collapsing demand for shipping, paper and oil on the Pacific Rim pummeled those sectors and led to bond defaults. About the same time, junk was also becoming a crucial source of financing for risky technology, telecommunications and Internet companies; when the default rate began rising last year, investors fled junk bonds for stocks.</p>
        <p>''Historically, the high-yield market really didn't finance technology companies,'' said Martin Fridson,  senior high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch. ''Portfolio managers preferred companies that had established cash flows, so that recoveries were likely to be high if a company failed.'' By contrast, he said, there is little chance of recovering anything if a technology start-up with no revenue defaults.</p>
        <p>MAKING matters worse, the Federal Reserve's efforts to head off inflation with increases in short-term interest rates have forced junk bonds to move in lock step to maintain an attractive spread.</p>
        <p>The spread is the interest premium that investors demand to compensate for the greater risk of default or interruption of interest payments. When yields on investment grade bonds rise, junk-bond prices must fall to keep their yields at an appetizing altitude above them.</p>
        <p>A year ago, a typical bond rated a notch or two below investment grade yielded 10.05 percent, or 426 basis points -- hundredths of a percentage point -- above the 5.79 percent to be had on a 10-year Treasury.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Fed has pushed up short-term rates by 175 basis points, and junk-bond yields have had to follow, with that same typical bond's yield climbing to 11.81 percent. Longer-term government rates have not risen nearly as much as short-term rates, so the spread over 10-year Treasuries has widened considerably, to 577 basis points.</p>
        <p>The implication of all that arithmetic is that junk-bond prices have fallen much more sharply than long-term government bond prices, as is evident in the performance of the funds that hold these bonds.</p>
        <p>The risk of default on junk bonds has also worsened lately and is unusually high for good economic times. Today, 18 percent of junk bonds are considered distressed, meaning that default is a real possibility, Mr. Fridson said. That is the highest rate since January 1992, when 22.3 percent were called distressed.</p>
        <p>A rising default rate is bad for bond prices, of course, so holders of junk bonds suffer, just as they do when spreads over Treasuries widen. But the allure for new buyers is increasing. ''We think the high-yield market is attractively valued and that the high default rate is priced in,'' said Tom Price, co-portfolio manager of the Strong High-Yield Bond fund, which has returned 0.75 percent this year. ''Those credits that have been struggling have been taken out to the woodshed, and if they default, it won't affect the overall rate.''</p>
        <p>One difficulty in analyzing the junk-bond outlook is in measuring the default rate with precision. Experts differ markedly on how to go about it. Moody's Investors Service includes the high-yield debt of developing nations, as well as convertible bonds, which are often below investment grade; it draws the bearish conclusion that defaults will worsen in coming months. But Sam DeRosa Farag, director of global high-yield portfolio strategy for Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, argues that including those asset classes skews the default rates upward, and that investors should look at the domestic corporate high-yield market by itself. Donaldson's forecast is for falling default rates.</p>
        <p>The issue is important for investors, because the junk-bond market is extremely cyclical, and the payoffs for those who call the bottom accurately can be big.</p>
        <p>''There's been a quiet storm about this, and most indicators are that the worst isn't over,'' said David T. Hamilton, an analyst at Moody's risk-management services. ''There is still a large proportion out there at risk of defaulting.''</p>
        <p>Moody's version of the default rate for speculative-grade issues was 5.4 percent for the 12 months ended May 31, more than three times the 1.5 percent in the same period three years earlier. By June 2001, Moody's expects the default rate for the trailing 12 months to peak at 7.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''It's a pretty big deal,'' said Mr. Hamilton, who estimated that junk-bond downgrades outnumbered upgrades by three to one in the first quarter of this year. Defaults have been widely distributed among industry sectors, he said, though price-sensitive commodity and shipping companies were among the first to default on their junk debt in the first quarter of last year.</p>
        <p>HISTORICALLY, Mr. DeRosa Farag said, returns and defaults have tended to reach peaks together. ''There is this assumption that if default rates go up, the returns are going to be poor,'' he said. ''But the historical pattern is that whenever defaults peak, this is when we have the best returns ever.''</p>
        <p>Junk bonds are now ''attractively valued,'' he said, because the average issue is trading at less than 85 cents per dollar of face value, the lowest rate since July 1991. He attributed last year's surge in defaults to the 1997-98 Asian woes, conditions that have since eased; by his estimation, the default rate is now falling slightly.</p>
        <p>Whatever view best describes the bigger picture, an important day-to-day issue bothers the junk-bond market: liquidity. Junk-bond funds have experienced cash outflows in 18 of the last 23 weeks, according to AMG. ''Week after week of outflows from the funds is an insurmountable barrier'' to a recovery in prices, said Mr. Fridson, at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>So there may be a glint of light in the figures for the last three weeks, which show the flow turning positive. Some hardy investors may be responding anew to the siren call of those fat yields.</p>
