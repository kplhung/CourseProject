        <p>Dr. Heather Ingrid Rieff, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward K. Rieff of West Nyack, N.Y., was married yesterday to Davis Austin Barker, a son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Sherman Barker Jr. of Lakeville, Conn. The Rev. Maureen Orfino, an interfaith minister, performed the ceremony at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville.</p>
        <p>The bride, 28, is a postdoctoral fellow in neurobiology at the University of Virginia, where the bridegroom, 29, will begin his second year of law school next month.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rieff, who is keeping her name, received a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard University. Her father is the superintendent of buildings and grounds for the Nanuet, N.Y, public schools. Her mother, Althea N. Rieff, teaches mathematics and computer science at Woodlands High School in Hartsdale, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barker was a Fulbright scholar in 1994 and 1995 at the University of Klagenfurt, in Austria. His mother, Carol J. Barker, teaches French at Indian Mountain School in Lakeville. His father is the dean of faculty and a history teacher at Hotchkiss.</p>
        <p>The couple met at Williams College, from which they graduated in 1993, but they did not begin dating until October 1995 during the Head of the Charles Regatta, after mutual friends who were supposed to meet them at a bar in Harvard Square got lost en route. When their three companions failed to show up, the two decided to continue on to dinner with each other.</p>
        <p>WEDDINGS  Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  A report last week about the marriage of Dr. Heather Ingrid Rieff misstated the bridegroom's first name. He is David Austin Barker, not Davis.</p>
