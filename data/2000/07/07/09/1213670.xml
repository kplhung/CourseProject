        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I must comment on the unfair portrayal of Dr. David Bank. You gave a forum to one dissatisfied patient. However, you did not investigate or report on Dr. Bank's reputation among his thousands of other patients.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bank is a superb dermatologist with an outstanding fund of knowledge. While I was in pediatric private practice, I referred hundreds of patients to him and never received a complaint. He is a thoughtful, considerate, compassionate physician who is truly an expert in his field. He is the author of the dermatology section of my textbook, ''Clinical Manual of Emergency Pediatrics'' (McGraw-Hill, 1997), and a contributor to numerous scientific articles in the peer-reviewed literature. Cosmetic dermatology is just one part of his professional activities. I hope that in the future a more thorough investigation occurs before publishing so critical an article.</p>
        <p>JEFFREY C. GERSHEL, M.D.  The Bronx</p>
        <p>The writer is chief of service of the pediatrics department at Jacobi Medical Center.</p>
