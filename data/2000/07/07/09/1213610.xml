        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Arboreal Scandal in Israel: Not All of the Trees Planted There Stay Planted'' (news article, July 3):</p>
        <p>The Jewish National Fund immediately formed a committee to investigate recent allegations about the uprooting of trees, as every tree planted in Israel is precious.</p>
        <p>Our ''Plant a Tree With Your Own Hands'' program is a crucial part of our national afforestation program, as it allows an individual to directly connect with the land of Israel. Every year, 80,000 saplings are planted through this program, in addition to the more than 2.5 million trees planted throughout Israel yearly by our professional foresters. More than 210 million trees have been planted. For  100 years, our organization has been addressing environmental, water resource and afforestation issues in Israel.</p>
        <p>RUSSELL F. ROBINSON  New York, July 5, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is executive vice president of the Jewish National Fund.</p>
