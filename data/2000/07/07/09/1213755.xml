        <p>Steve Phillips was there at the beginning, in Kingsport, Tenn., watching a 17-year-old fireballing teammate named Dwight Gooden break a catcher's hand with his fastballs.</p>
        <p>And he was watching again yesterday when Gooden pitched the Yankees to a 4-2 victory over the Mets at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Phillips, then a minor league infielder and now the Mets' general manager, remembers how Gooden overmatched Appalachian League teams, how one club's No. 9 hitter closed his eyes and swung and somehow beat Gooden, 1-0, with an opposite-field home run.</p>
        <p>Eighteen years later, Phillips passed on the chance to sign Gooden after he was released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in May. Gooden had pitched poorly for both Tampa Bay and Houston, and in the Mets' opinion, he could no longer pitch competitively in the majors.</p>
        <p>Gooden was pitching at the lowest level of the minors before the Yankees promoted him to face the Mets at Shea Stadium yesterday, to return to the stage of his greatest triumphs in the mid-1980's. He was not the Gooden of old, but he was surprisingly effective for five innings and was the winning pitcher in the Yankees' 4-2 victory.</p>
        <p>''He gave them a great effort,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>After the game, the teams boarded buses -- subway transportation was left to the fans, 54,165 of whom showed up in Flushing -- and headed to Yankee Stadium for the second game of a day-night doubleheader that the Yankees also won, 4-2. It was the first time since 1903 that two teams had played each other at different ballparks on the same day.</p>
        <p>Gooden, who was pitching at Shea for the first time since 1994 when he was still a Met, received mostly cheers when he was introduced. There were no signs counting the strikeouts of the pitcher once known as Dr. K, but Gooden recorded only one strikeout anyway. The Mets had six hits off him in five innings, but they walked just once and managed only two runs.</p>
        <p>''Once you get released, you're sitting at home and not knowing if you'll get back and play again,'' Gooden said. ''So today, I just wanted to make sure I enjoyed the moment rather than putting pressure on myself.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who was 0 for 3 against Gooden and left three runners on base, said: ''I can't really explain it. He just threw strikes; that's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Of Gooden's 77 pitches, 49 were strikes, and his fastballs came in about 85 to 90 miles an hour. Mets left fielder Benny Agbayani was 12 when Gooden made his debut in the major leagues in 1984, but from what Agbayani understood, yesterday's offerings would have been changeups back then.</p>
        <p>''Before, he wasn't throwing 85 to 86,'' Agbayani said. ''It was 95, 97. But he spotted the ball good today.''</p>
        <p>Gooden (3-3) left the game with the score tied, but Tino Martinez made him the winner with an opposite-field home run in the sixth inning off the Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones. Martinez went 3 for 4 with three runs batted in, and his homer was the only hit Jones allowed over the final 23 batters he faced after the Yankees took a 2-0 lead in the first.</p>
        <p>Jones (3-4) worked seven innings, giving up three runs on four hits and three walks. He has a 2.67 earned run average in four starts since returning from an assignment to Class AAA Norfolk, which followed a shelling by the Yankees in June.</p>
        <p>This game began ominously for Jones. Knoblauch lined the first pitch in front of a diving Jay Payton in center field. Payton popped up and threw out Knoblauch at second base, and Jones, whose expressions usually change as often as a statue's when he is pitching, pumped his fist in excitement.</p>
        <p>He could not have known the call was about to be changed by Umpire Robb Cook, who agreed with the Yankees' first-base coach, Lee Mazzilli, that Todd Zeile, the Mets' first baseman, had blocked Knoblauch's path to second.</p>
        <p>Mets Manager Bobby Valentine argued that Knoblauch never changed direction and that no contact had been made, but all it earned him was his first ejection this year.</p>
        <p>The Mets played the game under protest, but the Yankees soon had two runs on a double by Derek Jeter and an infield single by Martinez.</p>
        <p>Jones does not try to blow hitters away. He spotted his fastball well, and mixed in enough curveballs and sliders to keep the Yankees from swinging comfortably.</p>
        <p>Martinez's home run came on a pitch that was down and away; Jones did not regret it. Martinez then drove in a run in the eighth on a single off Dennis Cook.</p>
        <p>Phillips also must be sure that the Mets' offensive All-Stars, Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo, will hit again. But Alfonzo and Piazza combined to go 0 for 15 in the first two games of this series -- ''When we get hot, we have to get cold sometimes,'' Alfonzo said -- and it was up to the rest of the lineup to produce.</p>
        <p>Agbayani singled and scored on a bloop double by Derek Bell in the fifth inning, and in the seventh he was on second when Bell stood in with two outs and the Mets trailing, 3-2. Facing Jeff Nelson, Bell hit a high chopper to third. He might have beaten a throw from Brosius, but Brosius instead tagged out Agbayani, who was trying to advance. ''I froze, because I thought he was going to throw the ball to first base,'' Agbayani said. ''Then I heard Jeter tell him I was right there next to him. He was on his way, but he lost his grip when he was about to throw.''</p>
        <p>The Mets never had another base runner, and they were held scoreless over four innings by three Yankees relievers, securing Gooden's improbable victory.</p>
