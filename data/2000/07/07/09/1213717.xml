        <p>A day after two off-duty police officers shot and killed an unarmed man in an unusual rush-hour confrontation on a Queens highway, the authorities said yesterday that they could not explain why the man had leapt from a car into fast-moving traffic and then attacked the officers.</p>
        <p>The investigation into the shooting focused on whether the two officers were justified in firing their weapons at the man, Dandre Darnell Cisco, 25. He was shot and killed at about 6:20 p.m. on Friday, in an eastbound lane of Grand Central Parkway near Francis Lewis Boulevard, officials said.</p>
        <p>But the authorities also were trying to determine why Mr. Cisco, a chef from Glen Cove, N.Y., with no previous criminal record, jumped from a friend's car as it was moving at about 40 miles per hour on a busy highway, rolled along the pavement, then jumped up and attacked the two off-duty officers in their pickup truck. The two officers, who were not in uniform, had stopped the truck because they thought Mr. Cisco was an accident victim, officials said.</p>
        <p>''It's all very strange,'' said a senior police official who is involved in the investigation, being conducted by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau, the Queens Homicide Squad and the Queens district attorney. ''It's like something out of the 'Twilight Zone.' ''</p>
        <p>At the request of Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, the two officers have not yet been interviewed; it is standard practice in such cases for investigators to learn as much as possible about the event from other witnesses first.</p>
        <p>Owen Lamb, a lawyer for Russell BallengerJr., the driver of the car Mr. Cisco was in, , N.Y., said his client acknowledged that Mr. Cisco attacked the two officers without provocation. But Mr. Lamb said he had questions about how the police handled the incident, ranging from why they had responded to Mr. Cisco's assault with gunfire to their leaving Mr. Ballenger handcuffed on the pavement for half an hour next to his dead friend.</p>
        <p>Four people who saw the events gave similar accounts of the events to police and prosecutors, several senior law enforcement officials said. They were Mr. Ballenger, a driver and his passenger in a behind Mr. Ballenger's car, and a retired police officer driving behind the two officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballenger told investigators that he had no idea why Mr. Cisco jumped out of the car and that he had tried to stop him, one official said. But Mr. Cisco, who the police said is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds, broke free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamb, the lawyer for Mr. Ballenger, 25, a computer programmer who lives in Glen Cove, , said his client had known Mr. Cisco for 17 years but could offer no explanation for his actions, saying only that it was ''a wonderment'' and Mr. Ballenger was still baffled. Mr. Ballenger told the police that Mr. Cisco was accompanying him on a drive to Brooklyn to pay some bills. He gave two written and one tape-recorded statement to investigators, the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Cisco jumped out of the car and slid along the pavement in the center lane, picking up some severe scrapes, he rolled into a fetal position and then jumped up, the police said. The cab driving behind Mr. Ballenger's car swerved to avoid Mr. Cisco, and the officers' vehicle, a black Dodge Dakota pickup driven by Sgt. Stephen Borchers, 36, a 13-year veteran, pulled up after swerving to about a 45-degree angle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco ran to the driver's side of the pickup and began pummeling the sergeant with his fists, the police said. The police said Sergeant Borchers, who is about 5-10, and the detective with him, Jean Weller, identified themselves as officers.</p>
        <p>The police said that the sergeant tried to drive forward but slammed into the side of the cab. Mr. Cisco then ran behind the back of the truck as Sergeant Borchers got out and pulled his Glock 9 millimeter service pistol, the police said. Mr. Cisco came around to the passenger side as Detective Weller, 35, was opening her door.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Borchers, according to the account Mr. Ballenger gave his lawyer, pointed his gun at Mr. Ballenger.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Cisco then began punching Detective Weller, a 15-year veteran. She drew her five-shot .38-caliber revolver and in the the struggle fired three shots, the officials said, and Sergeant Borchers fired once. Mr. Lamb said his client believed that Sergeant Borchers fired through the cab and that he fired more than one shot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco died at the scene, with five bullet wounds, the authorities said, two of them apparently entry and exit wounds from a single shot. He had been shot in the back of the neck, the chest, the abdomen and in the groin area, according to Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner. She said the wound to the neck and chest killed him, perforating his spine, major blood vessels, heart and liver.</p>
        <p>The killing was the seventh by police this year and comes at a time when the department is under scrutiny by federal prosecutors for how it disciplines officers in police brutality cases. But while the New York department is often criticized in such cases, it historically has had a good record of restraint compared to other police forces around the country.</p>
        <p>A senior police official described the officers as responsible and capable. The official said that Sergeant Borchers had worked as a detective in the 108th Precinct and in the Internal Affairs Bureau and that Detective Weller had previously been assigned to the 110th Precinct detective squad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamb said: ''You don't want to appear to be police bashing, but maybe there is another way to handle these things. If an individual is being assaulted by a person who is unarmed, is the right answer a bullet?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cisco's family also faulted the police for the shooting.</p>
        <p>But several senior police officials defended the officers, noting that both suffered injuries to their faces indicating that the struggle was fierce and that Detective Weller had gun powder burns on her blouse, suggesting that her revolver was pressed close to her body.</p>
        <p>On the street in the working-class neighborhood of Glen Cove where Mr. Cisco lived on and off with his family, his great-aunt and grandmother seemed unable to find a rational explanation for the young man's death. They sat in a dark paneled living room, at times shaking their heads, at times tearful.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 22, 2000, Saturday  An article on July 9 about attitudes toward race among police officers in Harlem misstated the date of the killing of an unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo, by four policemen in the Bronx (an incident that aroused differing reactions along racial lines). It occurred on Feb. 4, 1999, not in 1998.</p>
