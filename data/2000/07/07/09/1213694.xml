        <p>Although women outnumber men sitting in the pews of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and studying in its seminaries, the denomination has never had a female bishop in its 203-year history.</p>
        <p>That may change on Monday, when the A.M.E. Church plans to elect bishops from among a candidate pool that includes two women. Both women are campaigning using the slogan, ''It's time.''</p>
        <p>More than 25,000 leaders of the A.M.E. Church, the nation's oldest predominantly black denomination, are gathering in Cincinnati through Wednesday for the church's general conference, which meets every four years to determine policy and elect department heads and bishops.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time in the history of the church that women have had a viable opportunity to be bishop,'' said Bishop William DeVeaux, president of the church's council of bishops. ''We've had women run before, but they were in no way considered to have a chance. But now we have women running who are truly viable.''</p>
        <p>If the A.M.E. Church elects a woman bishop, it would be the first among the three predominantly black Methodist denominations to do so, said Bishop DeVeaux. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church have never had women bishops, he said.</p>
        <p>The United Methodist Church became the first American denomination to elect a woman as bishop in 1981, and the Episcopal Church consecrated its first woman bishop in 1989.</p>
        <p>The A.M.E. Church traces its history to 1787, when black churchgoers protesting segregated worship walked out of a Methodist Episcopal church in Philadelphia. It now has more than 8,000 churches and about 2.3 million members, including 1.5 million in the United States.</p>
        <p>The A.M.E. Church has 20 bishops, and at least two are retiring this year. Among the 41 candidates for those seats are the Rev. Vashti Murphy McKenzie, pastor of Payne Memorial A.M.E. Church in Baltimore, and the Rev. Carolyn Tyler Guidry, who as a presiding elder supervises 19 A.M.E. churches in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''We have a stained-glass ceiling in this church, and a lot of it has to do with sexism,'' Ms. McKenzie said in a telephone interview. ''But our church is now recognizing that the women have the talent, the skills, the degrees, the experience.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guidry, who ran for bishop four years ago and lost, said she believed that the church was finally ready for a woman to be bishop.</p>
        <p>Until recently, she said by telephone, ''Women had not been in the positions of presiding elder, or pastors of major churches, and so had not made a major impact in our denomination. That has changed in the last 10 years, and Dr. McKenzie  and I have become major players in the church.''</p>
        <p>The A.M.E. Church began ordaining women as deacons in 1948 and as ministers in 1960.</p>
        <p>But it is only in recent years that bishops began appointing women ministers to the large, prominent congregations that have traditionally been the stepping-stones to bishops' seats, Bishop DeVeaux said.</p>
        <p>A resolution to set aside one bishop's seat for a woman was proposed on Friday, while some delegates on the convention floor cheered and chanted, ''It's about time.'' The resolution was referred to the Episcopal Committee.</p>
        <p>Jamye Coleman Williams, one of the sponsors of the resolution and a retired church officer, said: ''In our church, the majority of members and the majority of seminary enrollees are women. So it is not fair to deny them full inclusion. It's sort of like the civil rights battle, where nobody wants to give up power. People just don't want to relinquish power without a fight.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 13, 2000, Thursday  An article on Sunday about the election of bishops by the African Methodist Episcopal Church misstated the age of the church. It is 213 years old, not 203.</p>
