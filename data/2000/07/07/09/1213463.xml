        <p>LOCAL fishermen call it Yoohoo Creek for the orange-brown clay that has muddied its waters for four years and driven away trout. But the Esopus Creek used to be one of the best trout-fishing streams in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>Most of the mud comes from the Shandaken Tunnel, an 18-mile tube, which is operated by New York City and flows into the Esopus from the Schoharie Reservoir to help maintain the city's water supply.</p>
        <p>In 1998 the Catskill chapter of Trout Unlimited and several other groups teamed up with Riverkeeper, the environmental group,  to take their concerns to the city's Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
        <p>They hired experts to help make their case: the muddy water flowing into the Esopus was damaging the trout habitat and killing the aquatic insects they feed on. Since the city owned the reservoir that was creating the problem, it had a responsibility to do something about it.</p>
        <p>The state's Attorney General's office helped mediate discussions between the fly-fishermen and the city. But after almost a year and a half, the city refused to budge, and the fishermen filed suit in federal court.</p>
        <p>''The essence of the case is that under the Clean Water Act you cannot discharge a pollutant from a point source without a permit,'' said Karl Coplan, the Riverkeeper's lawyer, who is representing the fishermen. ''It's clear under the law that suspended solids are a pollutant.''</p>
        <p>The city has moved to dismiss the suit. Geoffrey Ryan, a spokesman for the city, said, ''The allegations in the complaint are without basis in law or fact.''</p>
        <p>But William W. Buzbee, a professor of environmental law at Emory University in Atlanta, said some legal precedents suggest that the law may be on the fishermen's side. In several earlier cases, polluted water being channeled from one body of water to another was found to be a violation of the Clean Water Act.</p>
        <p>The Shandaken Tunnel was built by the city early in the 1900's to take water from the Schoharie Reservoir to the Esopus, where it flows southward to the Ashokan Reservoir and on through aqueducts to faucets in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Water first began flowing through it in 1924, and muddy water, known as turbidity, has been an occasional problem in the Esopus ever since.</p>
        <p>But it only became a serious threat to trout in 1996, when a major storm damaged the clay stream banks in the Schoharie and the streams that feed it, turning the water reddish brown for months on end.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Esopus has often been crystal clear above the Shandaken Tunnel outlet and reddish brown below it, said Burt Darrow, who runs a fly-fishing guide service and has lived in the area all his life.</p>
        <p>If it gets bad enough, the mud can be a threat to the city water supply, because turbidity carries with it bacteria, metals and other dangerous pollutants and can interfere with the effectiveness of chlorination.</p>
        <p>The water, however, is generally cleaner in the Catskill watershed than east of the Hudson. And if turbidity becomes a serious problem, the city can use chemical treatments to help clarify the water.</p>
        <p>That is no comfort to the fishermen.</p>
        <p>''The stream is literally dying,'' Mr. Darrow said. ''This used to be the center of fishing in the Catskills. Now there are weekends when you don't see a single fisherman on the river.'' His own business as a guide has dropped significantly since the mud became a problem, he added.</p>
        <p>Ronald Urban, the president of the Catkskill chapter of Trout Unlimited, a party to the suit, said, ''It's had a real impact on the guides and on bed and breakfasts and motels up here.''</p>
        <p>There are several things the city could do to remedy the situation, Mr. Coplan said. The intake of the Shandaken Tunnel is on the bottom of the Schoharie Reservoir, where it is muddiest. The city could build a multilevel intake, which would minimize the mud flowing into the tunnel. It could also dredge the reservoir. And it could restore stream banks in the Schoharie basin.</p>
