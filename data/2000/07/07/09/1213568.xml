        <p>FOR fixed-income investors, there appears to be a silver lining in the cloud of rising interest rates: buying opportunities among closed-end municipal bond funds.</p>
        <p>Because of their particular structure, closed-end funds were affected by higher rates in several ways -- leaving many at attractive prices.</p>
        <p>Closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares, which may trade at a discount or a premium to their net asset values. Moreover, closed-end municipal funds often leverage their portfolios by issuing short-term preferred stock at a low rate and reinvesting the proceeds in longer-term issues with higher yields. So fund investors in leveraged bond funds fetch higher yields than they would in nonleveraged portfolios when interest rates are falling.</p>
        <p>But because long-term issues are generally more vulnerable to rising  rates than shorter-term debt, the leverage tends to backfire when rates kick up, as they have been doing recently. That has made it difficult for some closed-end bond funds to maintain their dividends.</p>
        <p>That is not the only issue weighing on closed-end muni funds. Many of them were started in the early 1990's, and the call protection on bonds they bought then has begun to expire. Call protection prevents issuers from refinancing existing bonds, protecting bondholders' yields for a fixed period, typically 10 years; as these higher-yielding bonds are called, many funds are replacing them with lower-yielding alternatives.</p>
        <p>The combination of factors has prompted many of the funds to reduce dividends. The cuts began after the Federal Reserve began nudging up short-term interest rates last year, and the pace of the reductions  accelerated sharply last month.</p>
        <p>In June, all nine of the Eaton Vance closed-end municipal bond funds cut their dividends by 10 to 12 percent. Soon thereafter, Nuveen Investments reduced dividends on 43 of its 59 municipal bond funds. Over all, 66 closed-end municipal bond funds cut dividends in June, according to Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, closed-end fund specialists in Miami.</p>
        <p>But that is where the buying opportunity comes in. Dividend cuts worry shareholders, who typically react by selling shares.</p>
        <p>Usually, the selling pressure depresses share prices in two waves: one comes several days after the announcement of the dividend cut, and the other comes several months later, when investors who did not hear the announcement receive smaller dividend checks.</p>
        <p>What investors often fail to understand, Mr. Herzfeld said, is that because bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, the sales have the effect of pushing up yields on closed-end bond funds. A result is that yields are now roughly equal to what they were before the latest round of dividend cuts.</p>
        <p>The Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust cut its monthly dividends 8 cents a share on June 4, when shares traded at $12.625, roughly a 22 percent premium to net asset value. The annual dividend before the cut was 96 cents a share, and it yielded 7.6 percent. A week later, the share price dropped to 9.75, or a 7 percent discount. At that point, the fund's yield was 7.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The lesson for investors is to evaluate closed-end bond holdings closely. If you find that a fund holds bonds yielding more than 10 percent, check to see if the call protection will soon expire.</p>
        <p>Also find out if net income per share is falling short of current dividends. In either case, the fund may be a candidate for a dividend cut and may be ripe for a sale.</p>
        <p>Conversely, you could consider buying shares of funds that have recently cut dividends and that trade for discounts of 10 or 15 percent or more, Mr. Herzfeld said.</p>
        <p>A Roster of Value All-Stars</p>
        <p>Litman/Gregory Fund Advisors of Orinda, Calif., is known for putting together all-star funds -- portfolios divided among successful, well-known outside fund managers. Masters' Select Equity, for example, is managed by seven domestic fund managers overseeing six portfolios, while Masters' Select International is managed by five managers of five foreign stock portfolios.</p>
        <p>Now previously beleaguered value managers are getting their turn, as Litman/Gregory introduces the Masters' Select Value. The managers are O. Mason Hawkins of Longleaf Partners, William Miller of the Legg Mason Value Trust, Bill Nygren of the Oakmark fund and Larry Sondike of the Franklin Mutual Series funds.</p>
        <p>Each manager will assemble a portfolio of 8 to 15 stocks, mainly in mid- and large-capitalization American stocks. The minimum investment is $5,000, and $1,000 for individual retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>''All four managers use a value approach to stock-picking, looking for  companies whose stocks they deem undervalued,'' said Craig Litman, director of Litman/Gregory. ''But each of them has a slightly different idea of what constitutes value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Miller are two of the seven managers of the flagship Masters' Select Equity, which has returned 21.7 percent, annualized, from its inception at the end of 1996 through June 30, compared with 19.7 percent for its category of large blend funds and 23.1 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Quarterly Disclosure Sought</p>
        <p>Mutual funds should be required to disclose to investors on a quarterly basis the fees charged to their individual accounts, the General Accounting Office said in a report to Congress last week.</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. said the Securities and Exchange Commission should draft rules instructing mutual funds to include in quarterly statements the specific dollar amount of each investor's share of operating expenses.</p>
        <p>The recommendation was contained in a report requested by Representatives Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on finance, and John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and a ranking member of the Commerce Committee.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., Representatives Oxley and Dingell urged him to ''take the necessary steps'' to put the report's recommendations into effect.</p>
        <p>''Investors deserve to know exactly what they are paying for mutual fund services on a regular basis,'' Mr. Oxley said in a statement. ''You shouldn't have to have a degree in high finance to figure out whether your mutual fund is giving you a good deal.''</p>
        <p>Mutual fund fees paid by investors include the day-to-day costs of running a fund, called operating expenses. Also, some mutual funds charge investors sales charges, called ''loads,'' which can be paid at the time of purchase or over a specific period or when shares are redeemed.</p>
        <p>Current disclosure practices inform investors only of the fees they are likely to incur, Mr. Oxley said. Specifically, the disclosures list only  percentages of fees and hypothetical examples in prospectuses, he added.</p>
        <p>The mutual fund industry organization, the Investment Company Institute, responded that mutual funds already make extensive disclosures about fees and that funds compete on the basis of performance, according to comments included in the G.A.O. report.</p>
        <p>''We have reservations about the account statement recommendation,'' Matthew Fink, president of the Investment Company Institute, said in a letter to Thomas McCool, the G.A.O.'s director of financial institutions and market issues. ''This requirement could erode the value of the standardized, all-inclusive fee information in the prospectus.'' The letter said such a rule could ''diminish rather than enhance investors' overall understanding of fund fees.''</p>
        <p>Industry researchers are concerned that although the fund industry has been growing rapidly, funds themselves are not operating more efficiently and fees are not declining enough.</p>
        <p>''Growth in the mutual fund industry has been powerful, particularly in the last decade,'' Mr. Oxley said. ''This growth gives mutual fund companies economies of scale, and investors ought to know whether these benefits are being passed on to them.''</p>
        <p>The G.A.O. analyzed data on the nation's 77 largest stock and bond funds and found that not all had reduced fees. Of the 51 funds that had at least 500 percent growth in assets over the eight years, 38 funds, or 74 percent, reduced fees by at least 10 percent, the agency said. The rest cut expenses less, including six whose fees did not change or rose, the G.A.O. said.</p>
        <p>Because operating expenses can be calculated in various ways, the S.E.C. should also consider ''the costs and burdens'' that different alternatives would place on the industry or on investors, the G.A.O. said.</p>
        <p>Neither federal law nor S.E.C. rules expressly limit the fees that mutual funds charge as part of their annual total operating fees, the G.A.O. said.</p>
        <p>Representatives Oxley and Dingell asked Mr. Levitt for two progress reports on achieving greater fee transparency in mutual funds, the first report at the end of the year and the second in June 2001.</p>
        <p>S.E.C. officials praised the G.A.O.'s report, while withholding judgment on whether the commission would move to require the recommended quarterly disclosures.</p>
        <p>''As the report points out, there are advantages and disadvantages of the report's recommendation and alternatives that need to be considered,'' wrote Paul Roye, director of the S.E.C.'s investment management division. ''We welcome the report's recommendations and suggestions, and will consider them carefully.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Levitt cited other S.E.C. initiatives intended to improve mutual fund disclosures. One pending proposal would require funds to report standardized investment returns on an after-tax basis in prospectuses and annual shareholder reports, he noted. (Bloomberg News)</p>
