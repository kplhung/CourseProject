        <p>ERIC JUDE BOUCHER, 27, is known as a person who does everything quickly. He makes friends and martinis in a flash. He talks so fast it's hard to keep up with his thoughts, and it's definitely difficult to catch him on foot: as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, he was captain of the cross-country team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher is also known for being self-effacing in everything from his humor to his wardrobe. Though he is an institutional bond salesman for Fuji Securities in New York, his style is not exactly typical of Wall Street. When running local races he almost always wears an ''I Love New Jersey'' T-shirt (he grew up in Ridgewood). ''He was always proud of Jersey, even in the face of ridicule,'' said J. D. Lumpkin, a college friend.</p>

        <p>ERIC JUDE BOUCHER, 27, is known as a person who does everything quickly. He makes friends and martinis in a flash. He talks so fast it's hard to keep up with his thoughts, and it's definitely difficult to catch him on foot: as an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, he was captain of the cross-country team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher is also known for being self-effacing in everything from his humor to his wardrobe. Though he is an institutional bond salesman for Fuji Securities in New York, his style is not exactly typical of Wall Street. When running local races he almost always wears an ''I Love New Jersey'' T-shirt (he grew up in Ridgewood). ''He was always proud of Jersey, even in the face of ridicule,'' said J. D. Lumpkin, a college friend.</p>
        <p>Remembering the night in 1997 when he met Emily Phillips Pennington at a party given by a friend, Mr. Boucher said: ''We liked each other right away, according to me. But it wasn't mutual by any means.''</p>
        <p>Miss Pennington, now 28, teaches kindergarten at the Buckley School, a boys' school in Manhattan, and is incredibly enthusiastic about everything she likes, especially chocolate chip cookies, daisies, hotel room service, Emily Dickinson poems and strawberries. ''A diamond necklace and a bag of candy would evoke the same response in her,'' said Hannah Pennington, her sister. ''She would get so excited.''</p>
        <p>At school, friends say, she brings her students all kinds of treats, from snowboarding magazines to a real-life bagpiper on St. Patrick's Day. One year, she wrote a play for the boys to perform, about a king who wouldn't get out of the bathtub. ''She has this knack with children,'' her mother, Camilla Jenkins, said. ''She just respects their humanness. She thinks of them as short adults.''</p>
        <p>When Miss Pennington met Mr. Boucher, she didn't show much enthusiasm. ''There wasn't an instant attraction,'' she remembered. Mr. Boucher phoned her persistently for weeks, but she never returned his calls.</p>
        <p>Then one night her roommate answered, and when she told him Miss Pennington wasn't home, Mr. Boucher asked the roommate out. ''I was trying for anyone to go out with me at this point,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That got Miss Pennington's attention. She called him back and agreed to have a drink. During their conversation that night, she was taken with Mr. Boucher's mischievous, boyish charm. (You can easily imagine finding sourballs and fishing worms in his pockets.) ''He's kind of quirky,'' Miss Pennington said. ''He's got his own style. He snowboards all the time and skateboards. He's always in a good mood. He's famous for wearing Hawaiian shirts. He wears them everywhere, even when it's not appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Like her, he's easily delighted by little things -- a good steak, a funny postcard, a snowfall -- while at the same time remaining ambitious and serious. (Both arrive at work before 7 each morning.) ''He's the perfect combination of very stable and very adventurous,'' Hannah Pennington said.</p>
        <p>On June 30, the couple were married at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste on the Upper East Side, with 12 of the bride's kindergarten students sitting up front. After the ceremony, the boys lingered to eat chocolate chip cookies (a present from the bride) and discuss her wedding gown.</p>
        <p>''She looked like a sea gull: white, with wings,'' Alexi Senbahar said.</p>
        <p>''Or a snowman,'' said Peter Schweikert.</p>
        <p>''Or a polar bear,'' another boy added.</p>
        <p>The wedding was as unpretentious as a kindergarten classroom. The bridesmaids carried daisies, and the couple caught a yellow cab to the reception downtown at the Puck Building, where the tables were decorated with framed family photographs and bowls of M&amp;M's.</p>
        <p>''Emily wanted daisies and chocolate chip cookies and candy and her boys,'' Sara Storey, a friend, said. ''She didn't care about anything else.''</p>
