        <p>COMPILING the history of American music in the fractious decades after World War II should not be so difficult, since so many witnesses are around to report on it firsthand. But it's amazing how much disagreement exists about a central -- perhaps the central -- issue of the period: the influence of composers who advocated 12-tone techniques, or serialism.</p>
        <p>A widely held belief asserts that during these years a band of rigorous, cutting-edge composers, mostly based in prestigious East Coast universities, seized the intellectual high ground and bullied their colleagues and students into accepting serial procedures as the only valid form of modernism. All those fusty holdouts still clinging to tonality were laughably irrelevant, the serialists argued. And if beleaguered audiences and even many critics recoiled from 12-tone music, well, the cutting-edge commando declared, that was their problem.</p>

        <p>COMPILING the history of American music in the fractious decades after World War II should not be so difficult, since so many witnesses are around to report on it firsthand. But it's amazing how much disagreement exists about a central -- perhaps the central -- issue of the period: the influence of composers who advocated 12-tone techniques, or serialism.</p>
        <p>A widely held belief asserts that during these years a band of rigorous, cutting-edge composers, mostly based in prestigious East Coast universities, seized the intellectual high ground and bullied their colleagues and students into accepting serial procedures as the only valid form of modernism. All those fusty holdouts still clinging to tonality were laughably irrelevant, the serialists argued. And if beleaguered audiences and even many critics recoiled from 12-tone music, well, the cutting-edge commando declared, that was their problem.</p>
        <p>Yet another, quite opposite take on that period holds that the 12-tone composers never wielded much influence, that they themselves were the beleaguered minority group marginalized by the majority of composers, who continued to write music that was essentially tonal and far more popular.</p>
        <p>So what is the truth? Enter Joseph N. Straus, a professor of music theory at Queens College. Surely, Mr. Straus felt, this question could be answered empirically. What percentage of composers at the time were serialists? Who held the teaching posts? Whose music was getting performed, recorded and published? The answer he came up with is clear from the title of his article ''The Myth of Serial 'Tyranny' in the 1950's and 1960's,'' which has been generating talk in academic circles since its publication in the Fall 1999 issue of Musical Quarterly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus's study was sociological, not aesthetic in orientation. ''I am not concerned with whether serialism is intrinsically good or bad, natural or unnatural, an inevitable evolution or an avoidable mistake,'' he writes, ''although those concerns were, and remain, alive in the literature.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus's disinterest in the merits of serialism for the purposes of his study is useful. But it's not as if those critics and musicians who hold that dogmatic 12-tone composers did in fact exercise inordinate and stultifying power during that period, as I do, are necessarily against 12-tone music. Whatever harm the dogmatism caused, the development of these complex procedures was exciting and produced a great body of important music. Most students during that period, and into the 1970's, were fascinated by the new modernism. Schoenberg and Webern were godlike figures whose scores were pored over in theory classes like Talmudic texts. Works by Milton Babbitt, Roger Sessions, Donald Martino, Charles Wuorinen and other 12-tone American composers were listened to with fascination and respect.</p>
        <p>For some time now the death of serialism has repeatedly been proclaimed. Yet all the lushly scored, tonally grounded neo-Romantic works that have been written over the last 20 years by a new generation of composers trying to win back audiences to new music have made all those knotty old 12-tone pieces sound more invigorating than ever. I would rather hear a Boulez chamber work or the Babbitt piano music than any crowd-pleasing piece by Richard Danielpour.</p>
        <p>The problem that led to the ''myth'' of serial tyranny was not the ascendancy of 12-tone music in the 1950's and 60's but the disdain that was heaped on composers who continued to write tonal music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus's findings suggest that the 12-tone tyranny never happened. The methodology he devised was basically reasonable. Confining his survey to the years 1950 to 1969 and focusing only on Americans working in the Western classical music tradition, he identified 468 composers who were notably active during those years. He then divided them into four categories. First, ''serial'' (including 12-tone composers), meaning composers who wrote with varyingly strict systems involving the ''precomposed ordering'' of all 12 pitches; Mr. Babbitt and Mr. Wuorinen are representative of this group. Second, ''atonal,'' a broad category including composers who adopted any ad hoc combination of nontonal procedures, some of whom were heavily influenced by 12-tone theory, like Elliott Carter and Leon Kirchner. Third, ''tonal,'' used in a broad sense to mean any composers who employed essentially tonal, modal, highly chromatic or Neo-Classical styles, like Samuel Barber and William Schuman. Fourth, ''experimental,'' meaning composers who departed from Western traditions and explored elements of chance and innovative sound resources in their works, like John Cage and Morton Feldman.</p>
        <p>While conceding that his categories and methodology are ''necessarily crude,'' Mr. Straus determined that during the period in question, more than two-thirds of the active composers were tonal, whereas serial composers constituted less than 15 percent of the total. Even combining serial and atonal composers, those commonly charged by concertgoers and critics with writing ''dissonant modern music,'' they still account for a ''distinct minority,'' Mr. Straus reports. His article includes charts and graphs galore to back his figures, showing the percentages of composers from each stylistic group who were getting published, performed, recorded and appointed to tenured faculty positions.</p>
        <p>My main reservation about Mr. Straus's methodology concerns his limiting the survey to the 1950's and 60's. The battle raged on during the 1970's, as is indicated by a quotation from an essay written in 1979 by Mr. Wuorinen, one of the many combatants Mr. Straus cites in his article, proclaiming the defeat of the tonalists.</p>
        <p>While ''the tonal system, in an atrophied or vestigial form, is still used today in popular and commercial music, and even occasionally in the works of backward-looking serious composers, it is no longer employed by serious composers of the mainstream,'' Mr. Wuorinen wrote. ''It has been replaced or succeeded by the 12-tone system, first initiated by Schoenberg, subsequently developed into a world of chromaticism extending far beyond the domains originally envisioned for its use.''</p>
        <p>SEVERAL times Mr. Straus restates that the serial and atonal composers constituted a minority, ''hardly a position of dominance.'' But the history of the world, from the Roman Empire to modern South Africa, is filled with examples of minorities controlling majorities. Mr. Straus concedes as much when he raises the question of prestige.</p>
        <p>''Certainly serialism in this period commanded an intellectual interest out of proportion to its actual measurable presence on the musical scene,'' he writes. The scientific aura, novelty and intellectual chic of 12-tone theory appealed to composers who were steadily losing an audience among mainstream concertgoers and who, disastrously, reacted to the situation by retreating into academic havens, where their complex works at least provoked discussions among their colleagues.</p>
        <p>Prestige cannot be measured with charts and data bases. You had to have been caught in the battle to understand the tyranny, as it was experienced by the tonalists. The trenches were in the classrooms, recital halls and lunch hangouts of every American university with an important music department. On these campuses, the most formidably complex serialist and 12-tone composers were intimidating figures. And vulnerable composition students were easily intimidated.</p>
        <p>It's hard to report on the climate of the times without resorting to personal recollections, and everyone who went through the period had them. As a music student at Yale in the early 1970's, I remember countless instances in which the prejudice against tonal music was voiced unabashedly. One fellow student, a fine young tenor, was ridiculed by a group of faculty and student composers at lunch one day for daring to suggest that Britten's song cycle ''Winter Words,'' which he intended to sing in his degree recital, was an important contemporary work.</p>
        <p>ONCE, a professor in a 20th-century analysis course would not allow my choice of a Shostakovich string quartet as a topic for a paper. Just try back then to defend Copland as a composer worthy of attention, and you would be greeted by condescending scoffs. Even Stravinsky's Neo-Classical works were regarded by many composers in the modernist camp as really rather slight.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that ingenious serialist composers everywhere were writing exciting and provocative works. The problem arose when young composers slavishly tried to imitate their teachers. There was nothing stranger than hearing rigorous, humorless, dry-as-dust 12-tone works by young Americans who had grown up with the Beatles and the Band.</p>
        <p>One telling incident truly captured the tense climate of the times. The composer Marvin David Levy received a commission from the Metropolitan Opera to help celebrate the opening of its new house at Lincoln Center. Mr. Levy's work, ''Mourning Becomes Electra,'' based on the O'Neill play, was given its premiere in 1967. Mr. Levy, then 35, was no tepid tonal composer. His music was gritty, thickly chromatic, pungent with dissonance. But as if to appease the academics, he force-fed his score with tone rows and reined in its lyricism. This wound up pleasing neither Met audiences nor the 12-tone dogmatists. The failure crushed him.</p>
        <p>Some 30 years later, he was invited to revise the work for a revival at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Though he did not radically change the music, he cleared it of extraneous 12-tone complexities and allowed it to sing more lyrically. He essentially composed the work he had wanted to write in the first place, he has said in interviews. It was performed during the 1998-99 season in Chicago to critical and popular acclaim.</p>
        <p>Established composers were also casualties of the battle. One is Harold Shapero, born in 1921. In the 1940's and 50's, Mr. Shapero was one of the most original and accomplished American Neo-Classical composers. But during the 1960's and afterward, while he continued to teach at Brandeis University, his output slowed to almost a standstill. Although he does not like to talk about it today, he could not bring himself to embrace 12-tone techniques that his Neo-Classical colleagues on the faculty, like Arthur Berger and Irving Fine, did. The dismissal of his tonal music in academic circles eventually defeated him.</p>
        <p>Overall, Mr. Straus's article is instructive and important. Like other critics quoted in the article, I am probably guilty of having used the term ''serialism'' too loosely in the past. Mr. Straus is of course correct that many composers who were vigorously atonal never employed full-fledged serial procedures. And whenever the ''dominance'' of 12-tone composers during that period is evoked, it should be made clear that this was never a numerical dominance.</p>
        <p>The development of 12-tone composition was one of the most invigorating occurrences of 20th-century music. As John Harbison likes to point out, the challenge of 12-tone theory made some composers who never quite adopted the techniques -- Messiaen, for one -- question themselves, rethink their work and emerge even greater. A vast number of bracing and lastingly important 12-tone works were produced during those decades. And most important, the 12-tone technique remains a vital and valid resource for composers today, when a wider range of musical styles exists than ever before.</p>
        <p>But I, like many critics and musicians, will never be argued out of my view that the dogma of the 12-tone composers during those decades had an intimidating and, on balance, hurtful impact on American composers, especially young ones. I was there during the battle, in the trenches, even if I was mostly just ducking for cover and waiting for the fighting to subside.</p>
