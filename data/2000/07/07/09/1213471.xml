        <p>IT is insensitive to be glib about troubled people who take the bold leap out of their personal closets or cages to reveal their fears and fetishes, compulsions and emotional paralyses, especially in a shared setting. Yes, we're talking group therapy.</p>
        <p>It might be something to sing about if the songs weren't glib. And if the musical that gives vent to them (''Inside Out'' at the 12 Miles West Theater Company here) sounds trite, tepid and dated, it's easy to blame the age of Oprah.</p>

        <p>IT is insensitive to be glib about troubled people who take the bold leap out of their personal closets or cages to reveal their fears and fetishes, compulsions and emotional paralyses, especially in a shared setting. Yes, we're talking group therapy.</p>
        <p>It might be something to sing about if the songs weren't glib. And if the musical that gives vent to them (''Inside Out'' at the 12 Miles West Theater Company here) sounds trite, tepid and dated, it's easy to blame the age of Oprah.</p>
        <p>Since ''Inside Out'' had a short off-Broadway run in 1994, tell-all tales have become tiresome.</p>
        <p>But therapy has boomed. As for the group kind, there is hardly a disorder imaginable that does not have its suffering members.</p>
        <p>For all that, ''Inside Out'' was, very likely, a formulaic trivialization even in its time. But nowadays, every dysfunction has its own specialist. This generic group of five, as well as their leader, seem to have sprung from an earlier time. What's worse, as psychobabble goes, everyone in the group ''gets it.'' Epiphanies fly. All doubts, repressions and hangups are broken through in unreal musical comedy time.</p>
        <p>Molly gets over obsessing about her weight. How? Harry, her womanizing husband moves out, and suddenly she's thin -- well, thinner; she was moderately anorexic in the first place. And Chlo stops rationalizing her admitted lesbian desires.</p>
        <p>Dena, once a recording star with a hit on the charts, resolves dissatisfaction with everything, especially herself, and stage fright. How? The group helps her get a cabaret act together.</p>
        <p>They also come to the marriage-saving and, of course shared, decision that will assure Liz, a fab cosmetics executive, of more time with Ron, her threatened husband, and their children. Liz will not take that power job; she will set up her own business at home. Clearly, Dena, Molly, Chlo, Sage and Grace know very little about the perils of home work, but it's only a song cue (''Do It at Home''). And we haven't talked about Sage, resident psychic. Say simply that she is transformational.</p>
        <p>Grace, more cheerleader than group leader, has a bromide for every phobia and seems ready to hit the inspirational lecture circuit. And whatever her therapy is named, role playing is its major component. In fact, ''Roleplay'' was the show's original title in 1992.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works. ''Liz, I'll be you and you be Ron,'' Grace says. All in the group play roles; as performers, they do them all exceedingly well. Liz (Tricia Burr) is so good as Liz, confrontational and sharp, that the situation would take on a more therapeutically plausible spin if Liz were group leader. Coup, anyone?</p>
        <p>On a deeper level, game playing substitutes for role playing. The self-explanatory name of the game is ''behind my back,'' and that could get nasty, but not while Grace is around, ''with a laugh and a smile and a song,'' to quote an old musical comedy lyric.</p>
        <p>Doug Haverty's lyrics are not that bright. Nor is his book. Though we do get to know these groupies, that is not really saying anything. It's just stretching to be charitable. No excuse is needed to praise the cast whose energy and adaptability go a long way to make ''Inside Out'' bearable. Only Mona Hennessy seems trapped within Grace. As for Adryan Russ's formulaic music, it sounds as if there's a melody for every malady (''Never Enough'') and thanks to Mr. Haverty's problem-solving words, an answer, too (''Let It Go'').</p>
        <p>Low self-esteem -- surprise -- is the main malady. But there's always the group to fix it.</p>
        <p>INSIDE OUT</p>
