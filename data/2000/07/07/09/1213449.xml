        <p>BY all appearances, the colonial at 73 Princeton Oval looks no different than any of its neighbors within College Park Estates, a subdivision under way in this Monmouth County community that will include up to 400 homes.</p>
        <p>But the 3,595-square-foot house is partly a showcase and partly a laboratory in which K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the state's largest builder, is testing 150 separate construction products, techniques and technologies for possible inclusion in future homes it builds. The company builds 2,000 homes a year in the state, ranging from town houses to large single-family homes and priced from $120,000 to $1.6 million.</p>
        <p>Ara K. Hovnanian, the company's president, said the aim of what he called the idea home is to find ''opportunities to build better houses with different features that will lower the cost to construct and operate the homes and add value to them.''</p>
        <p>The company is not alone. Housing officials and utility companies across the state also have begun plans to make building and owning homes more cost efficient. They involve identifying alternative construction methods and establishing uniform guidelines for putting energy-saving features into homes.</p>
        <p>A tour of the Hovnanian idea house last month revealed such innovations as large slabs of cement siding designed to look like  brick, roof shingles made of recycled rubber and a structural steel floor system. Other advances include a shallow insulated foundation and water piping made of polyethylene instead of copper. Polyethylene is cheaper, faster and easier to install than copper, even though more of it is needed in each home than with copper.</p>
        <p>The home also has energy-saving features such as more efficient heating and cooling equipment, including in-floor radiant heating. Also included is cellulose insulation, which is faster to install that the Fiberglas Hovnanian traditionally uses. The insulation, which is made from recycled newspapers and blown into walls, fills air cavities more tightly, conserving energy more efficiently. It also makes the most of space by including a 684-square-foot finished attic.</p>
        <p>In an industry slow to embrace change, Hovnanian is among a small group of major builders in the nation -- another is Centex Homes of Dallas, which has a division in New Jersey -- experimenting on a large scale with new ideas, said Larry Zarker, the vice president of marketing at the National Association of Home Builders Research Center in Upper Marlboro, Md. The center is the testing and research arm of the nonprofit builders association in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zarker said his group, with the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, was working with developers like Hovnanian in a national program to find ways to build houses that are more durable, energy efficient, environmentally sensitive and less expensive to build as well as to own and maintain. The two-year-old program, called Partnership to Advance Technology in Housing, encourages builders to try new technologies by helping them work with manufacturers and evaluate the ideas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zarker said evaluations were under way in 15 locations across the country, including at Hovnanian's idea home here. The center is tracking about a dozen of the 150 ideas being tested at Hovnanian, including the polyethylene water piping and the structural steel floor system. It is unlike a traditional wood system in that it spans a wider area without needing supporting posts, resulting in more open space in the house and a more solid feel to the floor. It also has openings, making it easier to install electrical wires and plumbing.</p>
        <p>''Most developers take a wait-and-see attitude when it comes to trying something different because of the huge risk and liability involved,'' Mr. Zarker said. ''But if leaders in the industry show that some ideas work, others may be willing to try them.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Cattano, the former director of codes and technical services at the New Jersey Builders Association in Robbinsville, agreed and added that the shallow foundation Hovnanian was testing was ''something we are promoting internally.'' The foundation requires footings that are 12 inches deep, compared to the 30 to 36 inches required by traditional foundations. It is also protected from frost by insulation as well as a water-resistant coating.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER challenge, Mr. Cattano said, is the learning curve involved with new products and materials. Meanwhile, he said, more and more builders in the state are using factory-built materials like wood panels to save time and money.</p>
        <p>Though housing sales in New Jersey and in the nation remain strong, Hovnanian is pursuing the idea home to prepare for when the market sours and added costs are harder to pass on to buyers, said David I. Cohen, the company's director of value and cost engineering. Other concerns, industry professionals add, are a tight labor market, particularly in the construction trades; the erratic prices of certain building products, especially lumber; and the rising cost of new homes.</p>
        <p>The average price of a new home to the buyer in New Jersey -- $275,000, up from $214,000 in 1995 -- is among the nation's highest, according to the state's builders association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said the Freehold house was Hovnanian's second idea home. In the first, built a year ago, the company made structural changes, such as using factory-built beams, to improve quality while shaving 10 percent off the cost of building a home. By using new products and technologies, the second house, he added, is intended save more money, increase comfort and make the home less expensive to maintain.</p>
        <p>While testing the 150 ideas will be completed in the next six months, including focus groups with consumers, Mr. Cohen expects at least one-third of them to be included as standard or optional features in the homes his company builds in the next six to 12 months.</p>
        <p>Doing so, he added, will shorten by one week the three months it typically takes to build a home and cut nearly $4,000 from its cost. The average price of a home the company builds in New Jersey is $234,024.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, all seven utility companies in the state plan to offer a standard statewide program and rebate to encourage developers to build homes that, like Hovnanian's idea home, are at least 30 percent more energy efficient than typical houses built in the state. Today, not every utility offers a program and those that do have different requirements and rebate levels. The rebates are to offset the additional cost of installing energy-saving features.</p>
        <p>A single uniform plan will encourage more developers to participate and ultimately reduce the cost to operate the home, said Fred Lynk, manager of marketing at Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's largest utility. The program must still be approved by the state's Board of Public Utilities, he said, adding, however, that it is expected be in place by year's end.</p>
        <p>The state last year also began a $17 million pilot program to encourage developers to build housing for low-  and moderate-income people that is designed to be not only energy efficient but also environmentally sensitive and more affordable. Under it, the state provides low-interest loans of up to $55,000 per unit to developers to offset the cost of designing houses with higher energy efficiency and lower impact on the environment. A reduced environmental impact is encouraged by, among other things, the use of building materials that contain recycled contents, are durable and help improve indoor air quality. Eight projects, totaling 424  units, have received financing through the program.</p>
        <p>There is also a housing demonstration project in the Northwest Inlet section of Atlantic City that showcases alternative construction techniques that reduce the time, labor, material involved in building a house and the cost of home ownership for people earning 50 to 80 percent of their area's median income.</p>
        <p>The $1 million project, called the Housing Demonstration Technology Park, is a joint venture between the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Center for Architecture and Building Science Research and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, which oversees state housing issues. Additional support came from HUD, the state's Casino Reinvestment Development Authority and the Atlantic County Improvement Authority.</p>
        <p>The park comprises seven one-  and two-family homes. Each was built using advances like lightweight steel framing, prefabricated structural insulated wall and ceiling panels and factory built modules, as well as solar heating techniques like photovoltaic collectors to convert sunlight into electricity.</p>
        <p>''One of the basic concepts of the park is to provide a window into the market for these new construction techniques,'' said Peter Kastl, director of housing and building technologies at New Jersey Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the state community affairs department, added that with the innovations advocated by the technology park and state program, ''all we can do is provide incentives and assistance and hope developers are willing to try them.'' The techniques are also applicable to market-rate housing, she added.</p>
