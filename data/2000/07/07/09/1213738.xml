        <p>In 1911, the French painter Robert Delaunay returned to his favorite subject, the Eiffel Tower, and created an intriguing work called ''The Red Tower.'' In 1936, Plainfield residents anticipated my favorite subject -- the hamburger -- and created an intriguing restaurant, also called the Red Tower. Both creations proved admirable and influential. Yet only one is historically linked with Fat Boy hamburgers.</p>
        <p>Flash forward to the year 2000: it was then that I visited Red Tower's sister restaurant, Red Tower II, on Route 22 in North Plainfield. Sure, I was curious about the original joint. I've even heard it sports a red turret. But this is a Quick Bite, and for these, I stick to the highways.</p>

        <p>In 1911, the French painter Robert Delaunay returned to his favorite subject, the Eiffel Tower, and created an intriguing work called ''The Red Tower.''

        <p>Flash forward to the year 2000: it was then that I visited Red Tower's sister restaurant, Red Tower II, on Route 22 in North Plainfield. Sure, I was curious about the original joint. I've even heard it sports a red turret. But this is a Quick Bite, and for these, I stick to the highways.</p>
        <p>Questions swirled in my head: Was Red Tower a local response to the old White Tower chain (itself a White Castle knockoff)? And what on earth is a Fat Boy hamburger? Entering Red Tower II, you are greeted by the cartoon image of a fat boy. A distant cousin of Bob's Big Boy? A hasty Internet search revealed ''Fat Boy'' burgers on the menu of a few scattered, seemingly unrelated establishments across America, but gave little insight on where Fat Boy fits in our hamburger heritage?</p>
        <p>Red Tower II offers up aselection of for breakfast, lunch and dinner, at reasonable (yet oddly unrounded) prices. I selected the quarter-pound Fat Boy with cheese ($2.97) and large fries ($1.98). I appreciated the Fat Boy's fresh ground beef, though the patty got a little lost in the over-sized Kaiser roll.</p>
        <p>The d'ecor is wood-grain Formica as far as the eye can see. Tiffany-style hanging lamps provide atmosphere. They also provide light. Delaunay scholars may disagree, but I envision the artist's final days. He is relaxing in a cafe in Montpellier. Inspiration strikes. Reaching for a cocktail napkin, Delaunay tunes out the world, and sketches the Fat Boy.</p>

        <p>Red Tower II, 864 Route 22, North Plainfield, (908) 754-0002. Red Tower, 500 Park Avenue, Plainfield, (908) 561-0353.</p>
