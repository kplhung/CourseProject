        <p>By the time you get to Orenco, you're thinking you might be on a wild-goose chase.

        <p>By the time you get to Orenco, you're thinking you might be on a wild-goose chase. The brochures tout the place as Oregon's exciting new urban village, but as the train trudges west from Portland, it's hard to escape the feeling that both urbanism and village life are receding in the distance.</p>
        <p>All the train stops have street addresses, but the farther out you go, the less seems to exist around them. Orenco, located at what is said to be the intersection of 231st and Alder Streets, is actually in the middle of a big grass field. You step down off the train, look carefully around you in each direction, and see empty land.</p>
        <p>But if you focus your attention several hundred yards to the north, you suddenly come upon a sight that is at once familiar and incongruous. White letters on a dark green signboard: Starbucks. And when you get there, after walking along a paved pathway cut through patches of five-foot-high weeds, you see something even more surprising. The Starbucks is housed in what looks like a turn-of-the-century Main Street shopping block, with big bay windows in the storefronts and round turrets on the tops of the buildings. Surrounding this business district are modest-size English cottages and Craftsman bungalows, geared to the same period look. Behind the houses stands a village green.</p>
        <p>This is Orenco Station, perhaps the most interesting experiment in New Urbanist planning anywhere in the country right now. It has been built on the premise that present-day Americans not only admire 19th century small-town community life, but will buy into it almost anyplace, even in a field of grass, at the far end of a suburban light rail line, where the streets don't lead to anything.</p>
        <p>Orenco is actually the latest in a string of closely watched New Urbanist experiments. In the 1980's, there was Seaside, the small Victorian re-creation on the north Florida Gulf Coast. In the late 1990's, there was Celebration, the Disney-backed traditional town built from scratch near Orlando. All told, there have been several dozen efforts in various parts of the country to establish or retrofit communities in a traditional direction, with walkable streets, downtown shopping, front porches and the numerous other accoutrements of New Urbanist values and ideas.</p>
        <p>But Seaside is mostly just a vacation resort; Celebration is a rich corporation's toy. Most of the other efforts have run up against a common problem: For all the traditional touches, they are still automobile-dependent. The front porches and picket fences are tiny icons of friendliness surrounded by traffic-choked arterial highways and parking lots.</p>
        <p>Orenco is no resort, and it is nobody's toy. It is a developer's high-stakes gamble on 200 acres of empty farmland -- eventually to include 1,800 residential units, 27,000 square feet of retail space and 30,000 square feet of office space built around a carefully designed main street. It is by far the densest, most urbanized mixed-use project yet built in the suburbs of its metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>And unlike most of its predecessor projects around the country, it promises a reasonable test of the idea of linking traditional design and public transportation. It is possible -- perhaps not easy, but possible -- to live in Orenco without a car. Downtown Portland is 30 minutes away on the Westside light rail line. The booming suburbs of Beaverton and Hillsboro, magnets for high-tech employment in what the locals call ''Silicon Forest,'' are on the same line. Intel has a big chip-making facility nearby as well.</p>
        <p>The developers of Orenco talk like missionaries. ''It is so far beyond what anyone else has done,'' proclaimed one of them, Rudy Kadlub, as the project got under way. ''But it is going to be the future of the country.''</p>
        <p>Certainly it is destined to have its imitators. Seattle is scheduled to open a 23-mile light rail line next year, and planners there are already looking into the possibility of Orenco-style villages spaced at intervals along the corridor. In Minnesota, Gov. Jesse Ventura has become a New Urbanist zealot. The Twin Cities metropolitan council, appointed by Mr. Ventura, has hired Peter Calthorpe, the California architect who is the spiritual father of the ''transit village'' idea, to help design traditional town centers for suburbs that lie in the path of new transportation projects being built there.</p>
        <p>So it is no small matter whether Orenco succeeds or fails. Nearly half the 450 houses that are planned have already been sold (most of the apartments are not yet built), but the biggest problem for previous New Urbanist projects hasn't been home sales; it's been an inability to attract the commercial infrastructure of everyday life: grocery stores, pharmacies, bakeries, barber shops, bookstores. It takes a whole streetful of merchants to make a village; without them, it is hard to see how Orenco or any development like it could change the face of suburban America in the way its promoters promise.</p>
        <p>Orenco jumped off to a flashy start in this respect. Its town center, which opened a year ago, already has a florist, a cleaner, a wine and cheese store, an Indian restaurant, a steakhouse and an Italian cafe. A stockbroker, a dentist and an insurance agent have set up shop in second-floor offices above the retail units. But there is no grocery and no drug store -- for that sort of shopping, the residents of Orenco have to drive a mile or so down Cornell Road, a busy four-lane thoroughfare that borders the development.</p>
        <p>The distance between the town center and the train station may be the most troubling feature of this whole ambitious experiment. Bold as they were, Orenco's designers didn't dare build the town center right next to the station. That might have given Orenco the compact charm of a true 19th century commuter suburb like Scarsdale or Winnetka. But then the local merchants would have had no customers other than the immediate residents. Placing the downtown nearly a half-mile away, closer to a multi-lane highway that is outside the development itself, creates the opportunity to attract drive-by traffic and gives the shops a better chance to survive.</p>
        <p>It is hard to fault the logic of this decision. But somehow that long walk across the open grass (where apartments will eventually be built), from station to Starbucks, suggests a moral not only to the story of Orenco but also to the story of New Urbanism in general: When it comes to building communities, the 20th century isn't over yet. The automobile is still king. You can challenge the car culture, even land some serious blows against it, but cars will exact their tribute before you are done.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, one fact is undeniable: People want to live in places like this. Orenco isn't even close to being built out, but a house there already costs 30 percent more than it did at the opening a little more than two years ago. Buyers are paying substantially more money for less space than they could obtain in a conventional suburban subdivision a couple of miles away.</p>
        <p>It's not that they believe they have found a perfect re-creation of 19th century America's small-town community life. It's that mere hints of that life strike them as an appealing contrast to the neighborhoods they see around them, and worth taking a chance on. If striving for the New Urbanist ideal requires a touch of fantasy, well, that is a quality that American suburbanites have always possessed in abundance.</p>
