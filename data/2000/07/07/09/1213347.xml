        <p>ONLY a handful of theater productions in Russia have meant as much to the eras in which they were made as the two that will be performed at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Lev Dodin's nearly seven-hour epic, ''Brothers and Sisters,'' opened at the Maly Drama Theater in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, on March 8 and 9, 1985, as the Soviet chief Konstantin U. Chernenko lay dying in Moscow and Mikhail S. Gorbachev was preparing to take control of the Communist Party -- and change history by instituting the policy that would come to be known as Perestroika.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Dodin described the period: ''Our show came to represent the changing of eras. There was something symbolic in its creation.''</p>
        <p>No such upheavals or omens accompanied the spring 1993 premiere of Piotr Fomenko's ''Innocent as Charged'' at the Vakhtangov Theater in Moscow. Perhaps the signs were there -- the second coup attempt in three years was only four months away -- but nobody saw them. And that was precisely the atmosphere that this lilting show delivered to a public exhausted by 75 years of politically conscious and socially oriented theater.</p>
        <p>''Innocent as Charged,'' an intimate work performed partly in a narrow room and partly in a snack bar -- locations that will be duplicated as best as possible when it is presented with simultaneous translation from July 19 to July 23 in the Pope Auditorium of Fordham University Theater -- was like a bombshell in reverse. It was so gentle, so lucid, so human, that audiences were almost shocked to be reminded of how simple and touching theater could be.</p>
        <p>The response to Mr. Fomenko's rejection of theater on a grand scale, both in terms of themes and space, was immediate and long-lasting. Throughout the remainder of the 1990's, the vast majority of innovative theater emanating from Moscow was made for small spaces and shunned civic issues in favor of personal ones.</p>
        <p>But theater on a grand scale was one of the legacies of the Soviet era, and few directors have worked with that legacy as successfully as Lev Dodin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodin, 56, began his professional career in 1967 and made his debut at the Maly Drama Theater in 1975. He was named the theater's artistic director in 1983. But it was his 1985 production of ''Brothers and Sisters'' that brought him to national prominence. Only three years later, the Maly embarked on its first foreign tour, which was the first step in making it one of the world's most famous theaters. In April, the director received the prestigious Europe Theater Prize in Taormina, Italy, an honor that had already been bestowed on the likes of Peter Brook, Giorgio Strehler and Robert Wilson.</p>
        <p>''Brothers and Sisters,'' which will be presented with English supertitles in four performances of two parts each at the John Jay College Theater from Tuesday through next Sunday, is a dramatization of a trilogy of novels by Fyodor Abramov bearing the overall title ''The Pryaslins.'' Abramov, who died in 1983, was one of the most prominent practitioners of whathas been called the rural or village prose movement in Soviet literature.</p>
        <p>''Abramov's prose is universal,'' Mr. Dodin said. ''This show has been performed in 14 countries. On our mission of traveling the world we have come to realize that all problems are common. They may differ in the way they are expressed or take shape, but they are the same in essence. That is why our theater is accepted and understood throughout the world.''</p>
        <p>The sprawling, swirling production involves some 40 characters and is set in a Soviet kolkhoz, or collective farm, in the years between the end of World War II and 1949. The first half, titled ''Meetings and Partings,'' observes the women of the village of Pekashino as they struggle to maintain a semblance of order in their lives before the surviving local men return from the battlefield. The second part, ''Roads and Crossroads,'' examines the progress -- or, more precisely, the lack of it -- in the village during four years of peace.</p>
        <p>The focus of the production is the clash between the villagers' high hopes for the future and the pathetically low return that reality provides on that optimism. As one character exclaims, after watching a newsreel of the Victory Day parade: ''The war is over! Soon we'll all have boots!''</p>
        <p>The village has survived through the deprivations of the war thanks to the resilience of the women, whose energy and optimism in the face of despair are extraordinary. The two complementary forces are expressed by Mr. Dodin and his cast through a sense of heightened and occasionally frank sexuality. Part 1 is suffused with the hunger of the women for their absent men and their competition for the one man, Misha, who returns home before the others.</p>
        <p>During one mad, drunken dance, as the villagers give vent to their despondency, sexual energy crackles onstage and is emphasized by a visual pun -- the image of two enormous, long, phallic gates, previously closed, swinging open and out over the first rows of the auditorium. However, these fleeting moments of ecstasy cannot be separated from the misery that has given rise to them. The merriment soon fizzles out and leaves Anfisa, the kolkhoz chairman, performing a sorrowful, whirling, solo dance.</p>
        <p>The second segment, which takes place in the spring of 1949, begins with a cheerful newsreel about a rich harvest. But suddenly the screen rises to reveal the listless faces of the villagers staring blankly into the auditorium. Apparently, the good life proclaimed by the government has not reached Pekashino.</p>
        <p>IN fact, at a time when life should have improved, it has only grown worse. The men are back, but the village remains crippled -- not by war, but by stupidity and ineptitude. The men, not questioning the inane and sometimes depraved bureaucracy of the state they serve, emerge as imbecilic if not cowardly and corrupt.</p>
        <p>At its best, ''Brothers and Sisters'' -- the title comes from a phrase that Stalin used when exhorting the Soviet population to repel the Nazi invaders -- offers an emotional wallop. But there is little that is new or innovative in its form. It is, after all, a product of the late Soviet period, though it remains a remarkably vivid and convincing piece of theater.</p>
        <p>In March, the company celebrated the show's 15th anniversary in the repertory with its 287th performance. Many critics were as impressed with that performance as they had been the first time they saw it, noting that the actors played with the intensity of an opening night. That is a Maly tradition: the actors treat every performance as if it were the first and might be the last.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Dodin, ''Brothers and Sisters'' has survived not only because it broaches problems that all audiences can understand, but because the play's issues have remained acutely relevant for his cast, virtually all of whom have performed for the entire 15-year run.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dodin calls his play ''the story of lost hopes and shattered illusions,'' adding: ''It is about what many of the actors personally have encountered in all the years they have been performing this show. There is no person who has never known disillusionment, broken ideals or humiliation.''</p>
        <p>The play was originally to have been part of the first New York International Festival of the Arts in the summer of 1988. Because of a sudden financial shortfall, performances were canceled at the last minute. ''The theater and the actors have retained the desire to perform in New York,'' Mr. Dodin said. ''Based on the way the show has been received throughout the world, I think New Yorkers will find it of interest.''</p>
        <p>''Innocent as Charged,'' or, as it is often called in English, ''Guilty Without Guilt,'' is in many ways the antithesis of ''Brothers and Sisters.''</p>
        <p>It is small, personal and utterly unconcerned with great social problems. It is an old-fashioned tearjerker, a melodrama by the celebrated Russian playwright Aleksandr Ostrovsky that delights in the simplest of human emotions -- maternal love lost and found. It tells the tale of a poor unwed mother who believes that her son died in infancy and who rediscovers him decades later, after she returns to her hometown as a famous provincial actress.</p>
        <p>THE author of more than 50 dramas and comedies, and one of the great Russian theater administrators of the 19th century, Ostrovsky often gave his plays a theatrical setting. ''Innocent as Charged'' depicts the world of theater as one of magical exaltation and petty strife. In Mr. Fomenko's interpretation, however, the enchantments of theatrical life permeate even the trivial jealousies and intrigues racking the local troupe where the actress's lost son, a troubled young actor, toils.</p>
        <p>The production offers a feast of details, from the intricate props to the actors' broad smiles radiating like sunshine. Cast members often speak to spectators or even sit down among them, not so much violating the fourth wall as encouraging the audience to take the mental leap into the world onstage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fomenko, 68, now runs his own popular Moscow theater, the Fomenko Studio. He is no longer associated with the Vakhtangov Theater and will not accompany the troupe to New York. He said that he felt the production required more rehearsal. He declined to comment further, saying only, ''I am busy building my own theater and rehearsing a new show.''</p>
        <p>However, if Mr. Fomenko harbors doubts about the condition of ''Innocent as Charged,'' they are not shared by Moscow audiences. Throughout its seven-year run, the production has played to full houses and remains one of the city's most popular draws.</p>
        <p>''Innocent as Charged'' occupies a special place in Mr. Fomenko's creative biography. He had been a highly respected director since the 1960's, having established his reputation with works of candor and subtlety. However, clashes with Soviet cultural authorities repeatedly obstructed his career. When ''Innocent as Charged'' opened, it was perceived as more than a sign that a gifted director had reached a new level of mastery. By returning theater to a human scale, it gave a kick-start to one of the most significant trends of the post-Soviet stage.</p>
