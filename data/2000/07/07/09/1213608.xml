        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 6 news article describing the apology issued by The Hartford Courant for publishing advertisements for slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries was interesting but ultimately perplexing and perhaps indicative of our current culture.</p>
        <p>What it comes down to is an issue of moral responsibility, but whose responsibility?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 6 news article describing the apology issued by The Hartford Courant for publishing advertisements for slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries was interesting but ultimately perplexing and perhaps indicative of our current culture.</p>
        <p>What it comes down to is an issue of moral responsibility, but whose responsibility?</p>
        <p>Obviously, the newspaper as an institution can make up for the errors of its predecessors by promoting freedom and equal rights. But how can someone in the year 2000 apologize for the sins of another person? How does anything said today absolve the actions of someone 200 years ago?</p>
