        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Would an ideally honest and free church of Christ still be a church?'' Richard Rorty asks in his review of Garry Wills's ''Papal Sin'' (June 11). Rorty opposes Wills's idea of a Roman Catholic Church that has no ''monopoly on the Spirit'' and ''has no time for heresy hunting.'' The best reply to Rorty's skepticism can be found in his very own philosophical writings. Rorty is one of the greatest advocates of relativism, the idea that there is no one truth or one reality that we all try to capture. A more pluralistic and tolerant way of thinking, Rorty claims, should replace the monistic viewpoint of religion and science.</p>

        <p>''Would an ideally honest and free church of Christ still be a church?'' Richard Rorty asks in his review of Garry Wills's ''Papal Sin'' (June 11). Rorty opposes Wills's idea of a Roman Catholic Church that has no ''monopoly on the Spirit'' and ''has no time for heresy hunting.'' The best reply to Rorty's skepticism can be found in his very own philosophical writings. Rorty is one of the greatest advocates of relativism, the idea that there is no one truth or one reality that we all try to capture. A more pluralistic and tolerant way of thinking, Rorty claims, should replace the monistic viewpoint of religion and science.</p>
        <p>But will this all-embracing liberalism force dogmatic institutions (like the Catholic Church) off the stage of history? A reading of Rorty's philosophy can bring us to answer this question negatively. Rorty perceives different religions and different branches of science and philosophy as alternative theoretical and practical traditions, and their writings as different genres of literature. None of these traditions capture the one true description of reality or have a direct ''hookup with the divine.'' Nevertheless, this understanding will not prevent these institutions from existing, but rather enable them to live side by side in a tolerant future.</p>
