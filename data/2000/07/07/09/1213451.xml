        <p>HOWARD FAST, the prolific writer of more than 80 novels, plays and screenplays, biographies and essays, has turned his attention to Greenwich.</p>
        <p>In his newest novel, ''Greenwich,'' (Harcourt Inc.) he uses the town as a  setting for his characters, both wealthy and working class.</p>
        <p>He recently celebrated his first anniversary with his wife Mercedes O'Connor Fast, 50, known as Mimi, in their Old Greenwich home. Mr. Fast, a trim man who looks much younger than his 86 years, exercises every morning and credits his good health to being happy and following his wife's careful diet. He works several hours a day at his home office on a vintage Olympia typewriter.</p>
        <p>His life was not always so seemingly pleasant. From 1945 to 1958 he was a member of the American Communist Party and because of that for years he found it difficult to get published. He was forced to use a pseudonym, E. V. Cunningham, for his 22-book series about a Zen Buddhist detective called Masao Masuto set in Beverly Hills and other books. He has since resigned from the Communist party.</p>
        <p>In ''Greenwich,'' the narrator observes that ''Possibly no town in  Connecticut was as sharply divided in attitude and political thinking as Greenwich, Ct.''</p>
        <p>His books often focus on historic or world events. Ten of his books deal with the American Revolution. Recently his film about George Washington, ''The Crossing'' played on A &amp; E. An Emmy Award from 1973, awarded for his screenplay ''Benjamin Franklin, Part III'' sits on a  bookshelf.</p>
        <p>He may be best remembered for ''Spartacus,'' a book he wrote in 1951 about a slave revolt in ancient Rome. The 1950's were difficult for Mr. Fast. To publish ''Spartacus'' he was had to establish his own publishing company, Blue Heron, since he was black-listed for his political activities. Ten years later, ''Spartacus'' was made into a successful movie.</p>
        <p>''Greenwich'' is the story of a wealthy investment banker, formerly a State Department official in charge of Latin American affairs. His past complicity in the murder of nuns and Jesuit priests in El Salvador torments him. Characters in the book include a writer (modeled after Mr. Fast), who is revising his novel called ''The Assassin.'' Mr. Fast's own novel, called ''The Assassin'' was published by William Morrow &amp; Co. in 1969 under his E. V. Cunningham pseudonym. Mr. Fast said that novel is expected to be reissued next year by Ibooks, publishers of books in printed form and on the Internet.  The book has not been scheduled for publication yet because ''My hope was that it would be printed as an appendix to Greenwich,'' he said. But Harcourt refused to do that, he added.</p>
        <p>Most of the action in ''Greenwich'' takes place north of the Merritt Parkway, in the area known as the back country, with some characters also from the Chicahominy section of Greenwich.</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. Fast met at his Old Greenwich home to talk about his 60-year career as an author and his new book. Following are excerpts from that conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. Why did you choose to set your book in Greenwich?</p>
        <p>A. Because I live here. And I knew a lot about Connecticut. I have lived here, on and off, for 30 years. I felt someone ought to write about a place like this. We've had a notorious murder. We've had two extremely notorious embezzlements. We have an amazing mixture of people. We have become very well known to the international crowd so we have U.N. people here. We have some of the wealthiest C.E.O.'s in America here. We have perhaps more investment  executives here than anywhere else in Connecticut. It's a fascinating group. I thought they were worth writing about.</p>
        <p>Q. Do local people recognize themselves?</p>
        <p>A. No one as yet has said ''How dare you say this about me.'' So far everyone I know in Greenwich loves it. I used my best friend's house up on the hill in Riverside as the setting for the writer. That's as close as I came.</p>
        <p>I have tried to shade it with every type that we have here in Greenwich. There are a lot of hard working people here who live in unostentatious  houses, plumbers, electricians, haulers. People who could afford their homes when they moved here 30-40 years ago. They live in Old Greenwich, not in the back country as they call it. Every house there is a mansion. People from that part of Greenwich are also in the book.</p>
        <p>Q. Why do you write the newspaper column?</p>
        <p>A. It's for The Greenwich Time and The Stamford Advocate. It goes out on the wire to 600 papers. I enjoy it. It gives me an opportunity to vent. Like most thoughtful people who watch what's going on in Washington, venting is very necessary. I have been doing it now for about 10 years.  At first it provoked a lot of angry letters because Greenwich is a Republican town and I'm as far from being a Republican as you get. Then the letters eased off.</p>
        <p>When I meet people at the grocery store or the barber shop they say ''I read your column. Don't always agree with you but I never miss it.'' Apparently they are used to me. The great fear of Republicans is what they are not used to. But when they get used to something they respond accordingly.</p>
        <p>Q. Do people still remember that you were in the Communist Party?</p>
        <p>A. Americans have no sense of history. And not much memory. They don't remember what happened yesterday. Some years ago a reader wrote a furious letter to The Greenwich Time, ''Did they know that a columnist they employed was the son of a notorious Communist?''</p>
        <p>Q. Do you still consider yourself a political activist?</p>
        <p>A. When I vote, the Democratic lane is not empty. Of course when I lived at the edge of the back country when I went to vote they couldn't find my name. I said, ''That's impossible I'm registered.'' They said, ''Oh, maybe you're a Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Here at the local level the Republicans want what the Democrats want: good schools.</p>
        <p>Q. In 1950, while living in New York, you were arrested and later imprisoned. What was the reason for that?</p>
        <p>A. I was in federal prison in West Virginia for three months for contempt of Congress for a refusing to comply with a request of a Congressional committee of Congress, the House Un-American Activities Committee.</p>
        <p>After the Spanish Civil War against Franco, a group of us got together a group of well-to-do people who were sympathetic to the lost cause of a Republican state. We bought a convent in Toulouse and converted it into a hospital run by the Unitarians. It took care of the Spanish refugees who fled to Toulouse.</p>
        <p>There were many thousands of them and their families. We were asked to give the donors names and refused. All 12 of us were sent to jail.</p>
        <p>Q. What are you working on now?</p>
        <p>A. My screenplay for ''The Crossing'' was just aired on A &amp; E. Now I'm working on a ''People's History of the American Revolution.'' It's one of these projects the end of which I don't see.</p>
