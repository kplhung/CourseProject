        <p>It is the Howard Hughes of towns.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason to come to Bolinas,'' Vic Amoroso was saying, adhering to the conventional wisdom in this famously reclusive place that no publicity is good publicity unless it is bad. ''The beaches are dirty, the Fire Department is terrible, the natives are hostile and have a tendency towards cannibalism.''</p>
        <p>Long known for its live-and-let-live attitude (except toward visitors, whom it would just as soon not let live), this spirited community of surfers, poets, artists, writers and aging mavericks about 30 miles up the coast from San Francisco has reached a tipping point of sorts.</p>
        <p>Perhaps nowhere is the Bay Area's relentless collision between hippie-van and BMW culture becoming more pronounced than in this preternaturally beautiful place at the tip of a peninsula, where earthy hand-built houses topped with lurching towers commune with shingled New England-style cottages with achingly sweet gardens. Two recent developments typify the threat that many see to the town's personality.</p>
        <p>First there was the rumor, plastered across the front page of The San Francisco Chronicle, that Martha Stewart had bought a house here. The news, which Ms. Stewart's spokeswoman denied, prompted a wave of satire that inspired one wag to put up a sign along Highway 1 -- the official signs pointing the way to Bolinas having been torn down by locals long ago -- that read, ''Martha: 2 miles.''</p>
        <p>Then came the decision to cancel the annual Fourth of July parade, a tradition for 130 years. That step followed a Fourth celebration last year in which thousands of outsiders bearing coolers showed up, throwing firecrackers out of cars, fighting and trashing the beach.</p>
        <p>An unincorporated village (population about 2,500) without a mayor or a city hall, Bolinas has a long history of not only tolerance but also environmentalism, having waged a successful campaign to control development. Richard Brautigan and the Jefferson Airplane lived here. Trees are pruned by Ferlinghetti's Compact Tractor and Chipper Service, run by Lorenzo Ferlinghetti, Lawrence's son. On special occasions, the Bolinas Bay Bakery has been known to whip up brownies made with kava, an herb that acts as a relaxant, and tie-dyed carrot cakes.</p>
        <p>It is home both to Susie Tompkins Buell, co-founder of the fashion company Esprit, who recently caused a furor by planting cypress saplings on the border of her estate and so created a potential to block views of the hillside from the road, and to Lloyd Kahn, a surfer who once built a geodesic dome of vinyl pillows inflated with nitrogen and who founded Shelter Publications, a small, scrappy publishing house here.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a cul-de-sac,'' said the 77-year-old retired postmaster, Annie Crotts, a Bolinas native who sings the national anthem on the Fourth each year from the balcony of Smiley's Schooner Saloon. ''People come here for all sorts of reasons. Either they don't like it and leave immediately, or they stay and become part of the scene. Then they want to keep it to themselves.''</p>
        <p>To those who love the town, the contrasts are becoming increasingly disturbing: Even as the annual Sun Festival to welcome newborn babies was being held a while back, three people were stabbed on the beach. The Free Box, a local landmark where free clothes are distributed from a shed painted with rainbows, seems strangely quaint beside the inexorable march of Bay Area wealth that has caused real estate prices here to skyrocket 30 percent in the last year.</p>
        <p>The question hanging like summer fog over this topographically insular community, surrounded by county, state and federal parkland, is whether a small place with limited resources, particularly water, can retain its character when real estate is such that venture capitalists are snapping up dun-colored hills where mule deer now graze.</p>
        <p>The other day, 125 townspeople showed up for a community meeting about the influx of visitors, especially ''belligerent young males fueled with alcohol and beach air who come to Bolinas with the intention of getting really wasted,'' in the words of Steve Kinsey, president of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, the town's official governing body. And with telecommuting to San Francisco an increasingly accessible option to outsiders who would like to live in Bolinas, ''tearing down signs on Highway 1 is not enough to keep people from getting here,'' Mr. Kinsey said.</p>
        <p>Bolinas originated as a Mexican land grant that included Stinson Beach, now a surfing mecca on the other side of the lagoon. The town has had a variety of past lives, among them as a seaside resort for San Franciscans fleeing the fog.</p>
        <p>In 1971, two Chevron tankers collided near the Golden Gate Bridge, sending more than 800,000 gallons of oil into the channels of the lagoon. The spectacle of oil-coated seabirds struggling to shore brought hundreds of hippies out of the hills to save the sea life. Many of them stayed, and became increasingly alarmed at town officials' plans to turn the place into another Carmel, including a yacht club and marina on the lagoon.</p>
        <p>Rather than fight city hall, the newcomers took it over -- specifically, the town water district, the locus of political decision-making. The board placed a moratorium on new water meters, effectively halting development.</p>
        <p>The post-hippie coalition still controls the town, including the existing water meters, which have become as wildly sought after as precious art.</p>
        <p>''Occasionally,'' said Mr. Amoroso, president of the water district's board, ''a house will fall off a cliff, and the water connection can be sold.'' The last one sold at a dot-commer price: $140,000.</p>
        <p>Among those who fear that success may spoil Bolinas is Magda Cregg, a 75-year-old sculptor who is the mother of the pop singer Huey Lewis and who describes herself as ''one of the hippies who came to clean up the oil spill, slept in the community center and never left.''</p>
        <p>''Huge fortunes change the town,'' Ms. Cregg said. ''It's gotten kind of feudal. The have-nots are working for the haves. It used to be a town of alternative lifestyles, people who figured out how to live on a pretty minimal scale. Now it'll be a hideout for Silicon Valley millionaires.''</p>
        <p>Her suspicions seemed supported early one morning when Jim Hubble, a 55-year-old retired money manager from Berkeley, emerged tan and fit from his station wagon and proceeded to hoist a wet suit over his knees. His luck in the stock market, he explained, is giving him the excuse to make good on a longstanding fantasy to learn how to surf, making him a living inversion of the famous Beach Boys song (sitting on top of the world, then catching a wave).</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Hubble is thinking of buying property here. ''It would probably be a better investment than the stock market,'' he said, before heading out to the swells. ''Because there's only one Bolinas.''</p>
