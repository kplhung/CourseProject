        <p>BOOKSTORE-RESTAURANT alliances are so common that many people start to salivate like Pavlov's dogs whenever they crack open a new book. Often these eateries are cappuccino and pastry spots. The Paradise Cafe in the Bookhampton store in Sag Harbor is an entirely different genre.</p>
        <p>The newcomer is a full-fledged restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner with stylish food prepared by Stephen Putnam, a James Beard award-winning chef. The cafe is situated in the 100-year-old Paradise building on Main Street. For the last 50 years businesses here have used the Paradise name, most recently the Paradise Diner and an ice cream parlor before that.</p>

        <p>BOOKSTORE-RESTAURANT alliances are so common that many people start to salivate like Pavlov's dogs whenever they crack open a new book. Often these eateries are cappuccino and pastry spots. The Paradise Cafe in the Bookhampton store in Sag Harbor is an entirely different genre.</p>
        <p>The newcomer is a full-fledged restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner with stylish food prepared by Stephen Putnam, a James Beard award-winning chef. The cafe is situated in the 100-year-old Paradise building on Main Street. For the last 50 years businesses here have used the Paradise name, most recently the Paradise Diner and an ice cream parlor before that.</p>
        <p>Patrons enter by way of the book shop, walk through a barroom with an impressive copper-topped bar and enter a long, narrow, spare dining room. Framed sepia photographs of early Long Island nautical scenes dot the walls.</p>
        <p>Service is the luck of the draw. One evening we had a super waitress who could hold her own with the best on the Island. Another night, our server was sweet and nice but slipshod. Water glasses were never refilled, used sliver remained on the table and the bread basket was never delivered. (That wasn't much of a loss. On the night we did receive it, the basket held very ordinary, somewhat stale French bread.)</p>
        <p>The quality of that bread was in sharp contrast with most of the food served. One of the best openers is the grilled Paradise flat bread with either a Parmesan aioli topper or one that resembles bruschetta with plum tomatoes, basil and goat cheese. (A combination plate is available.) Vying with the flat breads for best-appetizer honors was a special salad with roasted yellow and red baby beets surrounding a nest of arugula enhanced by chunks of goat cheese and sauteed Vidalia onions.</p>
        <p>A tricolored salad with dried Bing cherries, pine nuts and goat cheese truffles (fried balls of cheese) tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette was too sweet for my taste but had its champions. The field green salad in a sherry-shallot vinaigrette holds a few surprises: a mound of white bean salad and another of croutons.</p>
        <p>Other good bets are the clean, fresh-tasting gazpacho, thick with pureed vegetables, and the steamed mussels in a very tasty Dijon-country ham broth. The surprise hit of one meal was the crisply fried calamari. The tender, crunchy ringlets shared the plate with a romaine-radicchio slaw, the first cousin of a chopped salad, enlivened by a watermelon-miso emulsion.</p>
        <p>One of the platters justifiably turning heads in the dining room is the eight-ounce hamburger ($14) cooked precisely to order, topped with crisp pancetta bacon and Gorgonzola cheese and mated with a mountain of thinly cut, skins-on French fries.</p>
        <p>Two other scene stealers are the lightly sauteed sea bass perched atop a calamata olive couscous with a tomato fondue in a saffron broth, and the Moroccan glazed shrimp with roasted eggplant whipped potatoes. Ginger-crusted salmon with salsify, melted leeks and crisp lotus chips and spice-rubbed tuna atop a soba noodle cake with a soy-honey-vinegar sauce also made waves.</p>
        <p>But undercooking marred two dishes: grouper with a pink, rubbery center and a rib-eye steak that was blood rare rather than the medium rare ordered. The roasted jalapeno-Gruyere whipped potatoes with the steak nearly saved the dish.</p>
        <p>There are no duds among the desserts. The lavender creme brulee makes a grand entrance in what looks like a lidded glass candy dish. The chocolate obsession translates to a molten-center cupcake crowned with double chocolate ice cream and bourbon-chocolate sauce. Just as appealing was a warm apple tart topped with a ball of cinnamon ice cream rolled in walnuts with a drizzle of applejack caramel. Even the cookie plate is worthy: an assortment of homemade treats including chewy brownies and fun-to-eat Oreo-style sandwich cookies.</p>
