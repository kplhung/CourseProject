        <p>WHILE Louis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway's ''Writing to Vermeer'' plays at the New York State Theater beginning on Tuesday as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, the creators' first opera, ''Rosa,'' of 1994 can also be heard, thanks to a new recording (Nonesuch 79559-2; two CD's). There, compensation for the lack of Mr. Greenaway's visual contribution comes in the cover design, featuring a typically energetic and economically brushed horse by Susan Rothenberg.</p>
        <p>The image is suitable, for a horse is in some ways the central character of the opera (though, to be sure, it does not sing) and certainly the central symbol. Where, at one crucial point, a live black horse is meant to be lowered onto the stage, the music for the first time loses its smart, emphatic momentum to become a chain of quiet, foggy chords in high strings: one does not need to see the action to know that something ominous is going on.</p>

        <p>WHILE Louis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway's ''Writing to Vermeer'' plays at the New York State Theater beginning on Tuesday as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, the creators' first opera, ''Rosa,'' of 1994 can also be heard, thanks to a new recording (Nonesuch 79559-2; two CD's). There, compensation for the lack of Mr. Greenaway's visual contribution comes in the cover design, featuring a typically energetic and economically brushed horse by Susan Rothenberg.</p>
        <p>The image is suitable, for a horse is in some ways the central character of the opera (though, to be sure, it does not sing) and certainly the central symbol. Where, at one crucial point, a live black horse is meant to be lowered onto the stage, the music for the first time loses its smart, emphatic momentum to become a chain of quiet, foggy chords in high strings: one does not need to see the action to know that something ominous is going on.</p>
        <p>Trapped on a treadmill, the horse is caught in a frame of work and dependence, just like the human characters. Esmeralda, the wife of the composer Juan Manuel de Rosa, was treated by him as an animal by her own account, which is all the opera provides, partly because Rosa is dead before the start of the action. But Rosa, too, was a victim, not only in having been shot but also, before that, in having had to write music for westerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andriessen and Mr. Greenaway seem to view this as debasement for an artist, and the references Mr. Andriessen makes to movie music in the score are short and cheerless. He must also have been aware of being in the same position as Rosa, composing music to the orders of a film man, as those orders are represented by Mr. Greenaway's formal and unnerving libretto. But for him, the more irksome constraints are elsewhere. As in earlier works, Mr. Andriessen interprets the creative life in social terms, and skeptically. The artist in modern society is, like a workhorse, expected to produce an output steadily and in one direction. Hence the atmosphere of compulsion and resentment that pervades ''Rosa,'' as it does many of Mr. Andriessen's works.</p>
        <p>His music is as strongly pulsed, short-phrased and repetitive as Philip Glass's, but it comes out of a sourer and darker harmonic world, and like Kurt Weill's, it uses jazz-band sonorities to convey unease and decay. There is a sense of pacing or, more often, running in place: of being, indeed, on a treadmill. The opening orchestral music -- insistent and edgy, marked by a characteristic welding of saxophone and piano -- keeps rushing and unpredictably stopping, as if in search of an escape that will never be found.</p>
        <p>When voices enter, the messages they deliver are at first bleak and disillusioning. Chorus and soloists spend a long time just describing the stage and explaining that it now represents the floor of a slaughterhouse. Gradually the speed of events quickens, right through the continuous two hours of the piece, though the music's speed, of fettered allegro, stays largely the same.</p>
        <p>Gradually, too, elements of narrative are set in place, more or less securely. They are elements appropriate to an opera, elements of love and death. Rosa, a composer with a passion for horses and a job in the movies, has been shot while riding. Esmeralda comes from a family of slaughterhouse owners and has complained to her mother of Rosa's debasing behavior toward her. Various clues are presented, and various suspects, including Esmeralda's brothers. There is also an investigator or, as she is called, Investigatrix.</p>
        <p>She comes to no definite solution, but the evidence points to a mysterious death by misadventure. Rosa was killed as he rode off into one of his own movies, where perhaps, as an artist, he had been dying all along.</p>
        <p>The opera is dominated by two sopranos, who have to contribute a lot, by their sensuality and swing, to establish Mr. Andriessen's view of the opera house as another kind of nightclub, and who have to move through various other roles before they eventually become identified as Esmeralda and the Investigatrix. Both Marie Angel and Miranda van Kralingen meet the demands with vigor and enthusiasm. Lyndon Terracini sings the flashbacks for Rosa, who is rather pushed into a corner by these vocally well-endowed and self-confident women.</p>
        <p>Reinbert de Leeuw conducts, as he will also do ''Writing to Vermeer'' at Lincoln Center. The players of the Asko Ensemble and the Schonberg Ensemble keep up tension through the long passages of similar, driving music and are excellent, too, in those rare sequences where the score becomes slow, refined and delicate.</p>
