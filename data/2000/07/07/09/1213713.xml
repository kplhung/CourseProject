      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned throughout western New York over the last few days, her style occasionally invited comparisons with that of her husband. President Clinton is widely seen as one of the country's most effective campaigners, and Mrs. Clinton acknowledges that she has a long way to go to match his political adeptness.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton seems to have become far more comfortable as a  candidate, however, spending much of her time at public appearances chatting with people who come to see her. Indeed, her staff is often driven to frustration waiting for the first lady to complete the seemingly endless process of shaking hands, signing autographs, posing for pictures and discussing issues with voters. As a result, she is often quite late for appearances, to the consternation of everyone, it seems, but the first lady herself.</p>

        <p>As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned throughout western New York over the last few days, her style occasionally invited comparisons with that of her husband. President Clinton is widely seen as one of the country's most effective campaigners, and Mrs. Clinton acknowledges that she has a long way to go to match his political adeptness.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton seems to have become far more comfortable as a  candidate, however, spending much of her time at public appearances chatting with people who come to see her. Indeed, her staff is often driven to frustration waiting for the first lady to complete the seemingly endless process of shaking hands, signing autographs, posing for pictures and discussing issues with voters. As a result, she is often quite late for appearances, to the consternation of everyone, it seems, but the first lady herself.</p>
        <p>When asked today to compare her style of campaigning with that of her husband, Mrs. Clinton characterized herself as ''a baby campaigner. I'm still in the toddler stage.''</p>
        <p>Still, she seems to get high marks, at least from her fellow Democrats along the campaign trail. ''Despite the obvious handicap of having the Secret Service around, she does an extraordinary job of interacting with people,'' said Stephen M. Hughes, the mayor of Elmira, where Mrs. Clinton spoke at a rally on Friday. ''She never refuses a greeting line. And she really is very engaging.''</p>
        <p>At one point on Friday in Ithaca, Mrs. Clinton was confronted by a man standing amid her supporters who was holding a sign reading ''New Yorkers for Rick Lazio. Carpetbaggers Go Home.'' She walked over to him and shook his hand. ''I thanked him for coming out to see me,'' she said of the encounter. ''I'm glad to see him. It shows he is interested in the political process.''</p>
        <p>A Look Back</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Clinton is inclined to discuss all manner of campaign issues, from the need to energize tourism upstate to her interest in lower prices for prescription drugs, she is  not typically inclined to discuss herself. But with a year having passed since she formed her exploratory committee for her Senate race, she has appeared more reflective than usual during this weekend's campaign swing through upstate New York.</p>
        <p>And so the first lady, while seeming a little reserved, nonetheless talked to reporters about her first campaign for public office and the experience of traveling throughout the state of New York. ''I wasn't sure when I first started how I would feel about it because it is a very different experience,'' Mrs. Clinton said of being a candidate. She said that ''moving from an advocate for causes to becoming a candidate'' presented her with new challenges to make her positions clear to voters and to speak more directly to people than she has before. ''I found that I liked it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be more than a little evasive when asked, several times during this upstate campaign tour, what she considered the most difficult feature of being a candidate in her own right.</p>
        <p>''It has been a challenge feeling comfortable doing it,'' she said to reporters, after thinking about the question for a moment or two. ''I wanted to make sure that I was doing it for the right reasons. And I feel good about it.'' Despite being at the side of her husband and several other politicians over the last 30 years, she said, ''I had to learn to be a candidate. Those of you who were with me early on, I hope have seen a difference.''</p>
        <p>A New Approach</p>
        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, Mrs. Clinton's Republican rival for the United States Senate, completed his own bus trip through the state, with reporters often traveling in his fashionable bus, and spent considerable time speaking with the news media in what he has dubbed the Mainstream Express.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Clinton typically rides in her dark van with her aides and Secret Service agents, she took the unprecedented step of sitting on the campaign bus with reporters on the 20-minute ride from downtown Ithaca to the rally in Elmira.</p>
        <p>When asked whether she had chosen to sit with reporters because of Mr. Lazio's having done so during his concurrent bus tour, Mrs. Clinton said that her opponent's practice had nothing to do with the decision. ''Maybe it's because I haven't been invited before,'' she said. That elicited laughs from a press corps that has been hungering for opportunities to speak with the first lady outside more formal press conferences.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign aides, however, explain the bus-tour conversation more straightforwardly. Until the current upstate trip, there had been no Clinton campaign bus. Instead, the press usually traveled behind Mrs. Clinton in a van or, in the case of her trips in New York City, as best they could.</p>
        <p>''Generally speaking, all of our press corps can fit into a van,'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman. ''But because of the one-year anniversary, there was more press than usual. So we expanded and got a bus.''</p>
