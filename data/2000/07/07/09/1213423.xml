        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a transplanted Northern Californian reared on late-70's punk and early-80's new wave, I would never have imagined back then a CD player filled with the likes of Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard et al. But whereas Peter Applebome came to country through the 60's icons the Byrds, I'd like to tip my Stetson to a little trio from Belleville, Ill., Uncle Tupelo, which totally transformed my listening habits in the early 90's. Uncle Tupelo put out only four records before splitting up, but that small discography managed to wed the fury of punk with the wizened world view of country to produce a wholly unique sound and feel. Now, thanks to a band that never came close to making it, I've had the pleasure of listening in on quite possibly the richest vein currently being mined in American music, call it what you want -- Americana, No Depression, alt.country. This wealth of talent (Freakwater, Chris Mills, Neko Case, Richard Buckner and Calexico are my personal favorites) carries the torch of authentic country music and would do Hank and Merle and Johnny proud -- that is, if there was a radio station in Nashville that would play it.</p>
