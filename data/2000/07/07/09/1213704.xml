        <p>Out of bravery or foolishness, Patrick Rafter appears eager to all but crawl through the bars at the zoo and to step into the den that Pete Sampras prowls.</p>
        <p>Sampras is at his most intimidating on Center Court at the All England Club, where he has snatched up six titles over the last seven years, where his big-foot serve tramples opponents' spirits, where he has been nearly unbeatable. But on Sunday, Rafter could emerge as the perfect foil for Sampras's celebration plans.</p>
        <p>Rafter has never flinched in Sampras's presence. In fact, he has snapped back at him both on the court and off. In August 1998, Rafter served an ace on match point against Sampras in a Tour event in Cincinnati. Sampras thought the ball was out. And when the umpire did not agree, Sampras's ego seemed punctured by the moment. Quickly, Sampras's typically cool temperament came unraveled. Not only did he fume at the call, he also expected Rafter to step forward and replay the serve.</p>
        <p>If Rafter thought the serve was out, he might have. Rafter has a long history of good sportsmanship, and is well known on the Tour for giving back points on questionable calls. A year earlier, he reversed a line call that cost him a match. This time, Rafter did not see the serve as a fault.</p>
        <p>In the weeks that followed, Sampras reportedly said that if Rafter thought the serve was good, he ''must be smoking something that's not legal.'' Rafter countered by calling Sampras a crybaby.</p>
        <p>It was an odd back-and-forth between two very different players. Outgoing and approachable, Rafter is among the best-liked players on the tour. Even when he botches a serve toss and allows it to drop, he waves his hand at his opponent and always says, ''Sorry, mate.''</p>
        <p>The more subdued and serious Sampras is a recluse in comparison. So in some ways, it was not surprising when Rafter called Sampras recently and asked for a truce.</p>
        <p>''I called Pete up and resolved our differences,'' Rafter said on Friday after surviving Andre Agassi in a spellbinding five-set semifinal. ''I respect Pete for a lot of things. I think in a lot of ways he's lightened up over this year. I don't have any problems with Pete.</p>
        <p>''I think there's too much at stake to be worried about each other, thinking about your differences with each other. It's all put behind us now. This is the Wimbledon finals. He's going for his record, and I'm trying to find one here.''</p>
        <p>Rafter has a chance. Although Sampras holds a 9-4 edge, Rafter has won three of their last four matches, including the 1998 United States Open final. Oddly enough, in all of their meetings, they have never played on grass. Here, the serve means everything.</p>
        <p>So far in this fortnight, Rafter's surgically repaired right shoulder -- which has a shrinking life span of serves left in it -- has held up extremely well. The player who was ranked No. 1 in the world just one year ago is finally getting his groove back. Under inspection throughout this tournament, Rafter played one of the best matches of his career against Agassi in the semifinals. Mixing up his sliced backhands, using different spins on his serve, Rafter won a match that was more like a brain brawl.</p>
        <p>Sampras's march to this point has barely tested him. The 12th-seeded Rafter is the first seeded player Sampras has had to face in the fortnight. Although the less grueling matches have given Sampras ample time to rest the tendinitis that mysteriously crept into his left shin during the second round, the level of his game has been difficult to read.</p>
        <p>''I'm still here and I'm obviously very happy that I've gotten to this point,'' said Sampras, whose sore shin has limited his mobility at times. ''When you don't practice on your days off, you go out there kind of cold. It's not that comfortable.''</p>
        <p>For the first time since the second round, Sampras was scheduled to practice today in preparation for Rafter. To get by the serve-and-volley style of the Aussie, Sampras will have to return Rafter's grab bag of serves well and take care of his own; he'll have to find a razor-sharp passing game and be the aggressor on any short ball.</p>
        <p>''I saw a lot of his match with Agassi,'' Sampras said. ''He's playing great. He's a great athlete. He volleys well, covers the net as well as anyone in the world. I'm sure we'll both walk out there a little nervous.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, but Sampras is usually unflappable on Center Court. In advancing to his fourth consecutive final at Wimbledon, Sampras has won a record 27 consecutive matches on these grounds. That numbing number of victories might be a little daunting to some, but not to the competitive Rafter. Through the years, he has refused to bow down in Sampras's presence. He has even snapped back on occasion.</p>
        <p>''I remember going out in a match in '93 and playing him, being very scared,'' Rafter said. ''But things just went my way, and I ended up winning it. Since then, we've had some battles, and he's won most of them. But I've had my couple of wins over him.</p>
        <p>''This is a Grand Slam final. He's been here many times. It's my first one here at Wimbledon. I've just got to try to go out there with the same attitude I went out on the court against Agassi with. Just be relaxed. That's what I need to do.''</p>
