        <p>''SIXTEEN kids become smokers every day in Suffolk County,'' said Ginny Fields, a Democratic legislator who is chairwoman of the county's health committee, and she is determined to stop this trend with legislation that imposes fines and mandates community service in hospices for any teenager found buying or using tobacco.</p>
        <p>''We already have laws that say vendors can't sell tobacco to minors and that kids can't drink or drive until they're a certain age, and that people have to use seat belts and they can't go over the speed limit,'' Ms. Fields said. ''Look how many lives these laws have saved.''</p>

        <p>''SIXTEEN kids become smokers every day in Suffolk County,'' said Ginny Fields, a Democratic legislator who is chairwoman of the county's health committee, and she is determined to stop this trend with legislation that imposes fines and mandates community service in hospices for any teenager found buying or using tobacco.</p>
        <p>''We already have laws that say vendors can't sell tobacco to minors and that kids can't drink or drive until they're a certain age, and that people have to use seat belts and they can't go over the speed limit,'' Ms. Fields said. ''Look how many lives these laws have saved.''</p>
        <p>''I want to make our kids more accountable and let them know there are consequences for breaking the law,'' she added.</p>
        <p>It is illegal in New York State for anyone to sell tobacco products to those under 18, but it is not illegal for those under 18 to buy them. If vendors obey the law, then theoretically no one under 18 will get tobacco products. Ms. Fields would go after the young buyers.</p>
        <p>But her approach is opposed even by some antitobacco groups, who say existing laws are adequate. A few weeks ago, Ms. Fields delayed the submission when she heard from the Suffolk County Health Department and the Long Island chapters of the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society.</p>
        <p>''They felt that this kind of law would criminalize children and make them victims, and that education programs were better,'' Ms. Fields explained. ''But this is ridiculous. We're not doing enough. Children who smoke are already victims of a lifelong, destructive habit.''</p>
        <p>She said that before she resubmits her bill, on Aug. 2, she intends to confer with health experts in Florida, where a 1997 law prohibits those under 18 from obtaining tobacco products.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Clare Bradley, the Suffolk County Health Commissioner, responded: ''I agree with the intent of this resolution. However, ticketing or requiring kids who are caught smoking to perform community service has never been shown to decrease adolescent smoking, and I am not in favor of it. In a society where the tobacco industry actively markets youth, it is inappropriate to penalize kids who succumb to this marketing.''</p>
        <p>In Florida, the penalties for underage possession of tobacco range from community service to fines to suspension of a driver's license for 45 days, and Pam Jeralds, a health educator with the Duval County Health Department in Jacksonville, said that ''teenage smokers are declining by 5 percent every year.''</p>
        <p>Simone Lelchuk, a 17-year-old senior at Great Neck North High School and one of six nonsmoking sisters, agrees with Dr. Bradley, saying: ''I don't think that making the purchase of tobacco illegal will work. Besides, marijuana is illegal but it's rampant in our town and in other towns.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Fields echoes the concerns of bewildered parents on Long Island about how both they and their teenagers will survive the tumultuous years of adolescence and cope with the worrisome problems not only of smoking but of sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, body piercing, easy access to weapons and suicide as well. (Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among teenagers.)</p>
        <p>To address these problems aggressively, the medical school at the State University of Stony Brook has begun a novel program in which medical students are given the opportunity to deliver hands-on care to teenagers.</p>
        <p>''Adolescent health is horribly neglected in most medical schools,'' said Dr. Robin McFee, an assistant professor at the medical school and consultant for the Long Island Regional Poison Control Center, ''particularly in the first two years, when there is usually only about two to four hours devoted to the subject.</p>
        <p>''After the age of 12, when teenagers receive their last immunizations, many stop going to pediatricians and, if they're healthy, are often in medical limbo before they graduate to physicians for grown-ups. This gap includes years of high vulnerability, both physically and emotionally'' and the temptations of se, alcohol and tobacco.</p>
        <p>This inspired her in 1997 to set up the Seabury Barn Project with a first-year medical student, Christina M. Yambo. The program introduces medical students to adolescents' care.</p>
        <p>Dr. McFee cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta:</p>
        <p>*About 1.3 million people under 18 became daily smokers in 1996, compared with 708,000 in 1988.</p>
        <p>*Young people commit 25 percent of all violent crimes (although the rate has dropped from its peak in 1993).</p>
        <p>*The United States has the highest adolescent pregnancy rate in the developed world, one million each year (although the rate declined 17 percent from 1990 to 1996).</p>
        <p>*One in four sexually active teenagers catches sexually transmitted diseases each year.</p>
        <p>And those numbers do not include high-risk behavior like driving without seat belts or riding bicycles without helmets, she noted.</p>
        <p>Seabury Barn is an emergency shelter in Mount Sinai for teenagers who are homeless and physically or verbally abused. During the first year, nine medical students volunteered. Today more than 100 volunteer, with about one-third of incoming students participating on a regular basis. Initially financed by Dr. McFee, the project has recently received grants from the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine Foundation and the Urban Health Initiative of the New York Academy of Medicine.</p>
        <p>By honing skills in listening, observing and examining patients not much younger than they are, the medical students develop the skills of mentors as well as physicians.</p>
        <p>The project teaches teenagers to take responsibility for their own health, which is difficult, said Ms. Yambo, 28, a third-year student, ''because there are so many poor role models in society, especially in the sports arena.'' She cited Latrell Sprewell, the New York Knicks basketball player who tried to strangle his coach in 1997.</p>
        <p>''They suspended him for several days and then they put him on the team again,'' she said. ''This shows teenagers that as long as you make money, you can do what you want.''</p>
        <p>Violence and conflict resolution are high on the curriculum. Dr. Ronald V. Marino, professor of clinical pediatrics at Stony Brook and director of general pediatrics at Winthrop University Hospital, amplified this point, saying: ''It's not only teens who are violent. There is a rise in violence in all ages, and it's not a new phenomenon. Kids are not simply a part of our culture, but also a reflection of our culture. If a child sees one chain-saw murder, it's horrifying, but by the 10th time, he or she develops immunity and it has less impact.''</p>
        <p>''Someone has to help kids figure things out,'' said Dr. Marino, a specialist in behavioral-developmental medicine. ''Doctors have to ask teenagers what they're exposed to, if they're carrying weapons, if they've been sexually molested. And parents have to understand and forgive the superficial things like orange hair and multiple earrings, and recognize that their teenager is a human being searching for an identity. They have to give them time, give them respect, let them know they're loved.''</p>
        <p>Joshua Ardise, 24, a second-year student, said many teenagers ''are more honest than adults about admitting to their limitations.''</p>
        <p>''If I ask adults to stop smoking,'' he continued, ''they say they'll try to quit but light up a cigarette when they leave the office. But an adolescent says he likes it and the risks don't bother him, so you know that he's not avoiding a dialogue on the subject.''</p>
        <p>The results of a study published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine in May supports the premise of the project. Researchers from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine said teenagers who had a strong, positive relationship with an adult mentor were less likely to engage in risky behavior.</p>
        <p>''Our mission is to put adolescent health on the national radar screen,'' Dr. McFee said. ''We care about teenagers. We're doctors with hugs.''</p>
