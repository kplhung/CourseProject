      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>This week, Max Frankel files the last of his Word &amp; Image columns. For nearly six years, he has discussed, with insight and fervor, the major trends of our information age. He has paid special attention to the growth of media monopolies, to the conflict in news organizations between profit-making and civic duty and to stories that have been forgotten, missed or simply mistold. At a time of media proliferation, he has written valuably about what constitutes news -- and what does not.</p>
        <p>Max Frankel began his career at The Times during his undergraduate days at Columbia University 51 years ago, as campus correspondent. He went on to be a Moscow correspondent and Washington bureau chief, winning a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of Nixon's trip to China. He then served as Sunday editor, editor of the editorial page and executive editor, a position he held from 1986 to 1994. He is the author of ''The Times of My Life and My Life at The Times,'' an autobiography.</p>
