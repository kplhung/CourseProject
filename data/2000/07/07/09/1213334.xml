        <p>IT is 8 o'clock on a summery June morning -- early for most people. But not for Joan Hamburg. Awake since 5:30, she's already scoured the day's newspapers and magazines for interesting tidbits to use on her daily WOR Radio talk show; she's made the trip from her Upper East Side apartment to the station's quaintly retro studio near Times Square; and now she's busy taping a feature about head injuries for use on today's two-hour broadcast, which begins at 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>''Please, some water,'' she pleads, in tones more likely to be heard in a Brooklyn neighborhood than in a broadcast booth. ''The studio is so dry!'' And she does need lubrication: she's going to be talking all morning -- about shows and shops and restaurants as well as the items she's culled from the day's reading -- in the warm, confidential manner women use when chatting with their friends. She'll dispense tips on city living, interview an entertainer or the author of a book and then take calls for an hour, moving quickly from one topic to the next and keeping a million and a half people -- mostly women over 30 -- listening. Her audience, nearly twice the size of those for competing talk shows, earns the station nearly $1 million a year in revenue, a remarkable figure for a daytime show.</p>

        <p>IT is 8 o'clock on a summery June morning -- early for most people. But not for Joan Hamburg. Awake since 5:30, she's already scoured the day's newspapers and magazines for interesting tidbits to use on her daily WOR Radio talk show; she's made the trip from her Upper East Side apartment to the station's quaintly retro studio near Times Square; and now she's busy taping a feature about head injuries for use on today's two-hour broadcast, which begins at 10 a.m.</p>
        <p>''Please, some water,'' she pleads, in tones more likely to be heard in a Brooklyn neighborhood than in a broadcast booth. ''The studio is so dry!'' And she does need lubrication: she's going to be talking all morning -- about shows and shops and restaurants as well as the items she's culled from the day's reading -- in the warm, confidential manner women use when chatting with their friends. She'll dispense tips on city living, interview an entertainer or the author of a book and then take calls for an hour, moving quickly from one topic to the next and keeping a million and a half people -- mostly women over 30 -- listening. Her audience, nearly twice the size of those for competing talk shows, earns the station nearly $1 million a year in revenue, a remarkable figure for a daytime show.</p>
        <p>In her dark blue pants suit, bright flowered scarf and simple gold jewelry, Ms. Hamburg, who is in her late 50's, looks like an up-to-the-minute, high-powered business executive -- and she couldn't have gotten where she is without being tough and smart. But her folksy hodgepodge of a show belongs to the cozy, old-time tradition of Martha Dean and Arlene Francis, and it has won her a unique place in male-dominated commercial radio.</p>
        <p>What has made ''The Joan Hamburg Show'' successful? ''I think I have a feeling for what people want,'' Ms. Hamburg says, ''and for what works and doesn't work. I can talk about everything from the mundane -- how to get money back from a caterer who rips you off -- to thoughtful issues like the woman who called and said, 'What happened, suddenly I woke up and my mother's old and needs care and I've got a teenager and a business to run.' ''</p>
        <p>David Bernstein, WOR's program director, says: ''There's no one like her in radio. She went from being simply a consumer adviser to being someone people personally care about.'' Bob Bruno, the station's general manager, calls her ''everywoman,'' although he might be closer to the mark if he called her ''everywoman's mom.'' Along with John Gambling, whose popular show ''Rambling With Gambling'' precedes hers, she is a gold mine for the station. Advertisers line up to be on her programs, which include ''Weekend,'' on Saturday mornings with the food critic Arthur Schwartz, and ''Medical Minutes With Joan Hamburg,'' broadcast daily during Dr. Joy Brown's psychological advice show.</p>
        <p>''Every day someone comes here,'' says Sallee Bijou, owner of the Yellow Door gift shop in Brooklyn, ''and says, 'Joan sent me.' It's like a cult.'' Bill Muller, owner of Muller's Toyotas in Clifton, N.J., has advertised on the show for six years. ''I'd be a fool not to,'' he says. The first Wednesday of every month, Ms. Hamburg broadcasts live from Sardi's restaurant, where she interviews theater personalities, surrounded by listeners who come to see her. ''She sells out theater matinees,'' says Richard Kornberg, a publicist for Broadway plays.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Ms. Hamburg traces her success to the proverbial happy childhood. ''I've been lucky,'' she says. ''I grew up in Lawrence, N.Y., surrounded by a big, caring family. My mother told me I could do anything I wanted -- of course, with the expectation that I'd also get married and have kids.'' After graduating from Barnard College, she married Morton Hamburg, a lawyer who recently became a photographer. ''I really wanted to be an actress,'' she says, ''but I started writing for New York Magazine, and it was fun. Nothing was planned. My generation of women never thought we'd have careers.''</p>
        <p>For the first 11 years of their marriage, the Hamburgs lived in Vermont, before moving to New York with their two children, John, now a filmmaker, and Elizabeth, now an Internet entrepreneur. Ms. Hamburg had made something of a name for herself as a supplier of useful information while still in college, when she wrote ''New York on $5 a Day'' for the Arthur Frommer guidebook series. At least 20 books and hundreds of articles for magazines like Woman's Day and Ladies Home Journal followed, all geared to helping people live better. (Her most recent book, ''City Wedding,'' a guide to having one, came out last month.)</p>
        <p>She got her first radio job at WMCA doing consumer reports; after trying television, she proceeded to WOR, working for $15 a story because she'd been told it was the best radio station, with the strongest signal (it is heard as far as Massachusetts and Delaware).</p>
        <p>That was 21 years ago, and now she sits in the studio adjusting the headphones so they don't disturb her blonde coiffure. Her producer, Heather Cohen, delivers a big bottle of water, as well as some briefing papers. Ms. Cohen and Muriel Sohmer, her researcher for 20 years, are Ms. Hamburg's only staff. ''I'm obsessed with information,'' she says, explaining the crammed bookshelves behind her desk. ''You can't stay on the air two hours without a lot in your head.''</p>
        <p>Looking up, Ms. Hamburg checks the clock, signals the engineer and is off and running with ''Medical Minutes.'' This morning's topics are cancer, head injuries and teeth. A listener who had phoned her to complain of a botched crown job is told, ''Go to another dentist.'' Sounding like a combination kindergarten teacher and social worker, she advises, ''Get him to describe what happened and then send the report to the Dental Association. Always create a paper trail.'' Two hours later, she's interviewing the singer Leslie Uggams on her own show, empathizing and eliciting helpful hints on comebacks.</p>
        <p>When the show is over, Ms. Cohen questions Ms. Hamburg about the previous night's outing, to Guastavino, a new restaurant under the 59th Street Bridge. ''Great,'' says Ms. Hamburg. When an intern, Jessica Marshall, arrives, the talk in the studio turns personal. When Ms. Marshall mentions an upcoming date, Ms. Hamburg, a perpetual advice machine, issues a warning: ''Now remember, he's 15 years older than you are. Just be careful.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hamburg's afternoons are a flurry of phone conversations with listeners and advertisers and visits to stores and restaurants that keep her well-stocked with suggestions for her listeners. But this afternoon Ms. Hamburg must also begin taping several shows to cover the two weeks when she will be touring Europe with 500 fans. For the past eight years, WOR has offered trips for 350 to 700 listeners, who pay from $6,000 to $9,000 for the privilege of traveling with Ms. Hamburg and several guides. ''We've seen the world together,'' she says. ''But they only want adventure with me, no lolling about on Caribbean islands. I've walked up to the Great Wall of China in 100-degree heat and ridden elephants with them.'' This year, they will balloon in Stockholm, water bike in Amsterdam and hike in Estonia.</p>
        <p>''I love the outdoors,'' says Ms. Hamburg, settling down in her small office to eat a salmon salad, although she goes on to admit that her endless pursuit of information to share with her listeners often keeps her checking out local businesses and events even at her weekend house in the Hamptons. On her wall, she's put up a poetic photograph of a hammock taken by her husband, and a couple others of her white poodle Sadie. There are several plaques: one from Brandeis University names her woman of the year for her contribution to New York life; another, from the National Mother's Day Committee, calls her ''the MC with the mostest.'' An encyclopedia of antiques and another on North American Indian jewelry lie side by side on the bookshelves, next to ''How to Know God'' by Deepak Chopra and Maida Heatter's ''Book of Great Desserts.''</p>
        <p>''As you can see,'' Ms. Hamburg says, ignoring the ringing phone, ''I don't have much down time.'' Would she like more? ''I don't know,'' she says. ''I'm probably too restless.'' What's been best? ''Seeing my children grow up to be successful, responsible, caring adults,'' she says, to the last word the homespun figure her listeners love.</p>
