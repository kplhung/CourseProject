        <p>IN Manhattan, people usually struggle to find apartments, or at least they anticipate a struggle. No one expects a landlord to call up and say, ''Please come live in my apartment.'' Or, ''I'm so sorry I have to move you out, but I'll find you an even better place in the same building.'' .</p>
        <p>But that's been the experience of Telly Hatzigeorgiou. Shortly after graduating from New York University in 1988, Mr. Hatzigeorgiou took a room in a co-op apartment on Warren Street in TriBeCa -- before TriBeCa was filled with people living in multimillion-dollar lofts. In those days, he said, he often came out of the building in the morning to find car windows smashed.</p>

        <p>IN Manhattan, people usually struggle to find apartments, or at least they anticipate a struggle. No one expects a landlord to call up and say, ''Please come live in my apartment.'' Or, ''I'm so sorry I have to move you out, but I'll find you an even better place in the same building.'' .</p>
        <p>But that's been the experience of Telly Hatzigeorgiou. Shortly after graduating from New York University in 1988, Mr. Hatzigeorgiou took a room in a co-op apartment on Warren Street in TriBeCa -- before TriBeCa was filled with people living in multimillion-dollar lofts. In those days, he said, he often came out of the building in the morning to find car windows smashed.</p>
        <p>When the owner of the apartment sold the place in 1992, she felt so badly about displacing Mr. Hatzigeorgiou that she introduced him to the owner of another co-op in the building, who wasn't occupying his space and was thinking of selling it.  The landlord agreed to give Mr. Hatzigeorgiou the duplex space -- for a few months, anyway -- for $500 a month.</p>
        <p>A few months turned into a few years. The real estate market had collapsed and the owner couldn't get what he wanted for the place. The apartment is about 2,000 square feet on two floors, with a terrace off the living room and roof rights above with a view of the Hudson River. ''It became party central,'' Mr. Hatzigeorgiou said.</p>
        <p>Eventually, a friend from college moved in with him, but when the friend became a born-again Christian, things changed a bit. ''All the pictures of women came down,'' said Mr. Hatzigeorgiou, referring to his paintings. With their lives diverging, the roommate moved out, and then, three years ago, so did Mr. Hatzigeorgiou. He had decided to leave his job in global securities at Chase Manhattan and open a billiards parlor in Bayside, Queens.</p>
        <p>HE was only an occasional player of pocket billiards -- -- the proper term, although most aficionados call it pool. But he found himself starting the business after someone approached his father, who was in the metal-furniture business at the time, with a great commercial location.</p>
        <p>To make his commute to his new business easier, he moved to 75th Street and First Avenue on the Upper East Side, into a small one-bedroom apartment that cost $2,350 a  month.</p>
        <p>Over the next few years, he opened two more places in Queens, in Forest Hills and Flushing. And then this year, in March, he opened his fourth, and his first in Manhattan, Chelsea Bar and Billiards on 21st Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. (Mr. Hatzigeorgiou's first name, by the way, is short for Aristotle. It was torture in college, he said, when on the first day the professors would call out that name.)</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Mr. Hatzigeorgiou's former landlord on Warren Street called him and asked if he would like to move back in. The photographer who had been renting the place had just left, and the landlord wanted someone he knew and trusted. He offered the apartment to Mr. Hatzigeorgiou for $2,500 a month, about half of what he could get if he put it on the market.</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Hatzigeorgiou, 34,  wasn't interested in moving; he was too busy, and he just couldn't focus on it.</p>
        <p>But then he realized that, with his new business in Chelsea, it made sense to be downtown again. ''I love TriBeCa,'' he said. ''I never wanted to leave. It's discovered, but undiscovered at the same time. Secluded.'' On the Upper East Side, he said, the streets were more intense.</p>
        <p>''There was more hustle and bustle there,'' he said. ''Every block had a billion things going on.''</p>
        <p>And so he decided to move back, thinking, he said, that it would be a snap. In fact, he told the movers, when they asked him to estimate, that he would probably have about five boxes. It turned out he had 55.</p>
        <p>But after just a few days, he looked totally settled. Before moving in, he had done some renovating, putting in a new kitchen, and a rubber surface on the deck. And soon, the new weather-resistant pool table will arrive, taking up residence on the deck.</p>
