        <p>A wood stove heats the little green shack in winter. Beaver have their own tunnel from the living room to a nearby pond. And the 87-year-old ruler of this kingdom would prefer that most people stay away.</p>
        <p>Hope Sawyer Buyukmichi is overseer of the aptly named Unexpected Wildlife Refuge, a 540-acre preserve encompassing blueberry fields and apple orchards where deer, beaver, fox and many other creatures live in peace under her watchful eye.</p>
        <p>''I only let five people on at a time, and that's by appointment only,'' Mrs. Buyukmichi said in a voice barely above a whisper. These days, Mrs. Buyukmichi is on morphine for pain from shingles, which has incapacitated her. ''They don't mean to be destructive, but people are. Too many feet trampling rare plant species, children trying to take home snakes to the city. Beaver can do no wrong, but people . . . ''</p>
        <p>The refuge -- about 10 miles south of Egg Harbor City -- was started by Mrs. Buyukmichi (pronounced B-YEW-k-macha) and her husband, Cavit, in 1960 when they bought the first 85-acre tract that included the house. They registered as a nonprofit organization in 1961, and the refuge, with a board of six directors, was begun. Mr. Buyukmichi died of cancer 12 years ago.</p>
        <p>Currently there are 20 volunteers who take turns cutting trails, mowing the field where the bluebirds nest and splitting the 10 cords of wood it takes to keep Ms. Buyukmichi alive in the pines each winter.</p>
        <p>The author of four books -- ''Hour of the Beaver,'' published by Rand McNally; ''Unexpected Treasure,'' published by M. Evans Company; ''Beaversprite,'' also by Rand McNally; and an autobiography titled ''Hoofmarks,'' published by J. N. Townsend -- Mrs. Buyukmichi gets by on royalties, Social Security and donations to the refuge.</p>
        <p>She and a 47-year-old daughter, Nermin, who suffers from a bipolar disorder, are the only humans living full time in the 540-acre wood.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Buyukmichi, who was raised in Watertown, N.Y., and her husband, a native of Turkey, met while she was a secretary at Cornell University.</p>
        <p>After living in Turkey for eight years with their three children -- Nedin, 53, Nermin, and Linda, 42, the family moved back to Newfield, where Mr. Buyukmichi worked as a metallurgist.</p>
        <p>''It was my son that gave me the idea to start the refuge,'' she said. ''He was 8 years old. I was reading a book on birds and he said he'd never seen a bluebird. I looked around New Jersey and all I saw were bulldozers and no bluebirds.''</p>
        <p>When a friend told her about the 85-acre lot going on the market, she and her husband bought it and never looked back.</p>
        <p>''From then on, instead of spending our money on frivolous things, we bought land every chance we got,'' she said. ''Of course, this land had been abandoned for some time and the hunters thought it was theirs. I took them to court. I stopped them my way. Peacefully, with no guns.''</p>
        <p>And until last year, the family had never paid taxes on the land that sprawls across Newfield and Buena. But Buena Vista ''got itself a new tax assessor last year and he decided to start charging her taxes at a rate of $20,000 a year plus back tax,'' said Don Eyre, a volunteer at the refuge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eyre was among those who helped the refuge obtain tax-exempt status from  the state's Green Acres program. ''They offered to give her the money to pay the tax, but if they give you money then you have to let them come in and kill deer to thin out the herd,'' he explained. ''Hope said, 'No way.' She's spent 40 years keeping hunters off the refuge.''</p>
        <p>Last year Mrs. Buyukmichi personally walked the perimeter, posting more than  2,000 signs that mark the area as a Green Acres-sponsored wildlife refuge with no hunting allowed.</p>
        <p>''We have 17 stations set up throughout the refuge and patrols that go out every fall to keep the hunters away,'' Mr. Eyre said. ''We don't shoot at hunters. We call the police. Anyway, she held on and in the end they exempted her from the tax and the deer go untouched.''</p>
        <p>But a neighboring farmer, Al Trionfo, 74, doesn't like the restriction on hunting since the deer often graze on his crops. ''If I were younger and they'd let me, I'd be out there hunting them in a minute.''</p>
        <p>Still, his wife, Helen, said: ''Hope and her family have always been good neighbors to us. They're good people.''</p>
        <p>Perched delicately on an old metal chair in her front yard and looking like one of her beloved wrens in a brown jacket and slacks, the tiny widow keeps vigil over her ''friends,'' the animals. White hair as thin as corn silk flows uncut to her narrow shoulders, and gray-green eyes as sharp as pine needles dart around catching the slightest movement in tree or pond.</p>
        <p>''Snake,'' she said nodding toward the 20-acre pond that is so thick with white waterlilies one would be tempted to try walking across its surface. ''Beaver come up right there to eat apples I feed them. I'm training them so that others can come here and feed them and see them as friends too.''</p>
        <p>A few yards away, down a damp and narrow path, the beaver have erected a huge six-foot-high lodge and dammed the pond. For years a beaver she had named Chopper lived in the house with the mistress of the refuge, traveling from living room to pond and back again through a hole cut in the floor and a tunnel specially dug from the basement to the water's edge.</p>
        <p>''He was an orphan,'' Mrs. Buyukmichi said. ''A farmer dynamited the lodge and killed his parents when he was just a baby. Chopper was taken to the Humane Society, where a woman adopted him but turned him over to me when he was 3 months old. I finished raising him.''</p>
        <p>But Chopper roamed to a nearby Girl Scout camp, where he tried to climb into a boat to greet some local sport fishermen and was beaten to death with an oar.</p>
        <p>''People, they just don't understand that the animals are our friends,'' the elderly woman said. ''That's why there's no fishing here. No hunting. No cutting of trees.''</p>
        <p>To keep her refuge looked after, some new blood was needed. Enter Sarah Summerville, 36, of Egg Harbor City, an environmental scientist. Ms. Summerville was taking a graduate course on wetlands at Rutgers, where she met Mr. Eyre, who invited her to meet Mrs. Buyukmichi.</p>
        <p>''Being out in nature is very satisfying,'' Ms. Summerville said. ''I just love being here with Hope and the animals. I want to keep it her way. Hope and I clicked. We sit around playing Scrabble tournaments.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Buyukmichi said with a smile: ''Sarah's coming out here to live now in the old cottage on the other side of the property. She'll feed the beaver and mow Bluebird Field and keep the trails clear.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Summerville plans to stay at her job  and keep the refuge intact when she is not at work. And she intends to help keep Unexpected Wildlife Refuge ''wild and free'' and open to small groups. (Those who wish to visit and feed the beaver, walk the trails, bird watch or volunteer can call (854) 697-3541 for an appointment and directions.)</p>
        <p>''I'm just going to become part of it,'' she said. ''Like Hope.''</p>
