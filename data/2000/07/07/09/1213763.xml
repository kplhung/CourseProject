        <p>Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch found himself at the center of controversy at the start of the day and a hero by the time the strange Queens-Bronx doubleheader between the Yankees and the Mets concluded last night.</p>
        <p>Restlessly making his way through postgame interviews, Knoblauch was focused on making his exit, not on his controversial trip around first base to begin the first game, or his three-run home run to decide the second game, both 4-2 Yankee victories.</p>
        <p>''It was a very long day,'' he said. ''I'm happy that it's over. The first game ended at about 4:30 and we didn't get here until 6 o'clock. Changing stadiums is kind of crazy when you think about it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees were at least buoyed by sweeping both ends of the home-and-home doubleheader.</p>
        <p>''When you're part of something that only happens every hundred years, it's a fun day,'' Yankee reliever Mike Stanton said. ''To tell you the truth, it felt like two days.''</p>
