        <p>WHEN she was pregnant with her first child three years ago, Suffolk County Police Officer Sarah MacDermott was given permission to handle administrative tasks rather than continue patrol duties and risk a confrontation that could injure her and her unborn child.</p>
        <p>When she told her supervisor last month that she was again pregnant, Ms. MacDermott said, she was told she could either resume patrol or go home sick.</p>
        <p>''I thought they would have accommodated me,'' she said. ''Within my squad there were two openings on the desk and there was another pregnant officer already working the desk.''</p>
        <p>But, Ms. MacDermott said, her supervisor told her that he had to comply with an April 12 department directive that said any officer with an ''off-duty injury, condition or illness that prevents him or her from performing full police duties will not be allowed to work until such time as said officer is able to perform full police duties.''</p>
        <p>Ms. MacDermott, 33, is one of three pregnant Suffolk County officers who are now on sick leave as a result of that directive. All said their union, the Suffolk County Police Benevolent Association, told them that senior police officials had promised the directive would not apply to pregnant officers.</p>
        <p>''I feel betrayed,'' said Ms. MacDermott, an 11-year veteran. ''They turned their back on me and are changing the rules as we go along. This is a step backward for women.''</p>
        <p>But an assistant county attorney, Robert H. Cabble, insisted the directive applied to all officers. He acknowledged that ''over the years, the police department had apparently developed an ad hoc system of occasionally granting light-duty status to officers who had an illness but who could still do light duty.''</p>
        <p>The new directive, he said, was to bring the department into accord with state law. The state requires police and fire departments to afford employees with a duty-related condition an opportunity to handle only light duty but, said Mr. Cabble, ''there is no comparable provision for nonduty related illness.''</p>
        <p>The lawyer for the P.B.A., Allen Kranz of Hauppauge, said: ''That statute has no relevance to non-job-related injuries or illness. There is no statutory authority that prevents the Suffolk County Police Department from making this accommodation.''</p>
        <p>And he said that historically, ''female police officers who have become pregnant have always been given a nonconfrontational position.''</p>
        <p>Congressman Michael P. Forbes, Democrat of Coram, said he viewed the directive as ''forced leave'' for pregnant officers. In a letter to the Department of Justice, he said, ''This ill-conceived policy needlessly undermines the morale of officers who dedicate their lives to protecting us.''</p>
        <p>At the request of Mr. Forbes and Senator Charles E. Schumer, an assistant attorney general, Robert Raben, said, the Justice Department has opened a review of the policy. In a letter to Mr. Forbes on June 13, he wrote that the intent was ''to determine whether that policy is consistent with federal Equal Employment Opportunity law and the provisions of our consent decree with the county.''</p>
        <p>That agreement, in 1986, settled a federal discrimination suit over police hiring of nonwhites and women. Kimber L. Mahoney, president of the Suffolk County Association of Women Police, said that in light of that settlement, ''I can't believe they would issue a directive that would deter women from seeking careers in law enforcement.'' She noted that there were 265 women officers out of 2,700 in Suffolk, or less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Patricia O'Brien, 26, said she had been on sick leave since she reported for work on June 2 with a note from her doctor asking that she perform only sedentary duties because she was pregnant.</p>
        <p>''When I gave in the doctor's note,'' she said, ''they sent me home and hired another person to come in early on overtime to work the desk. They then assigned the officer on the desk to take my car.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahoney said it would have made more sense ''and saved the taxpayers' money'' if Ms. O'Brien had been allowed to work the desk. ''Replacing her with officers at time-and-a-half -- I'd love to do the numbers.''</p>
        <p>The third woman on sick leave, Sandra Lochren, 31, joined the force in 1993 and for the past four years has been assigned to the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program, teaching a 17-week course to elementary and junior high school students. She said that when school ended in mid-June, she was three months pregnant and was slated to be reassigned to patrol duty.</p>
        <p>''I thought about going on the road,'' she said, ''but my safety and that of my child are more important than this job, and there was no reason I should jeopardize them. So I went in and told my supervisor that I was pregnant. He let me stay on the desk that day, but later in the day told me that as of tomorrow, they would not be accommodating me anymore and would have to put me in a sector car. I was pretty disheartened.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lochren said she planned to return to her job about a month after her child is born in January. She said she has not even considered another career. ''I have 8 years invested in this one,'' she said, ''and another 12 left before I could retire. I'd prefer not to stop in midstream.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mahoney noted that all three women would have run out of accrued leave time -- sick days, personal days and vacation -- before their due dates, and would not be paid after that.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine the added stress that will put on those families,'' she said. ''And when they do bring their babies home, there will be no time to bond with them because they will have to go back to work to help pay the mortgage.''</p>
        <p>All three women are married to Suffolk County officers and all said they planned to ask for permission to use their husbands' sick days to keep their paychecks coming. But Ms. Mahoney said the county's policy on that practice had been inconsistent.</p>
        <p>Representative Forbes said he welcomed the Justice Department review because he and his staff were convinced the policy violated the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1976 and the Civil Rights Act of 1965.</p>
        <p>''Traditionally, the department has been very benevolent,'' he said. ''Now all of a sudden they are forcing these people to take sick leave. It's unfair to force a pregnant woman to take six or seven months of forced leave that she might otherwise use to take care of her child after birth. It seems to me a step back in time.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to the Justice Department on May 26, Mr. Cabble insisted that the directive applied to all officers and that ''any claims that the order applies only to pregnant officers are false.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabble said that any pregnant officers who wished to continue working have the right to do so ''provided they are able to perform the essential duties of their assignments.''</p>
        <p>''The police department cannot, however, create light-duty assignments for them to the exclusion of others,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But both Ms. Mahoney and Ms. MacDermott said that after the directive was issued, male officers who suffered off-duty injuries had been assigned to desk jobs.</p>
        <p>''One officer said he hurt his neck and his supervisor let him work the desk,'' said Ms. MacDermott. ''Another said he hurt his back and he was put on the desk for two or three days until he could return to work -- and he was in my squad. There's favoritism.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Frayler, president of the Suffolk P.B.A., also said he knew of no male officer who had been refused a request for light-duty assignment because of an off-duty injury.</p>
        <p>He said he had accompanied all three women to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission when they filed a complaint two weeks ago. And Mr. Kranz, the P.B.A. lawyer, said he had filed a union grievance and planned to file a lawsuit once the federal review was completed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kranz pointed out that both the New York City and Nassau County Police Departments permitted pregnant officers to take light-duty assignments.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Nassau County Police Department, Inspector Pete Matuza, confirmed that the department had a policy of placing pregnant officers on light duty at their request. He said pregnant officers generally took sick leave about a month before their due dates. They can then use either accrued sick leave or unpaid maternity leave for up to one year.</p>
        <p>Suffolk officers receive 57 sick, vacation and personal days a year, all of which can be accumulated, so Ms. O'Brien would need at least three years to save enough days to be able to have another child.</p>
        <p>''The department is saying if you want to be a cop you can,'' she said, ''but if you want to be a mother, you have to wait the three or four years to have enough time on the books to avoid being home on unpaid leave. You have to make certain accommodations if you want female cops.''</p>
