        <p>WHEN it comes to films and film festivals, can there be too much of a good thing?</p>
        <p>Starting Friday, when the Long Island International Film Expo 2000 opens in Malverne, and continuing with the 2000 Stony Brook Festival, then ending with the Huntington International Film Festival, more than 50 feature films will be screened over 17 days. That's after the Long Island Film Festival showed 20 features at three sites in Suffolk in May, and before the Hamptons International makes its splash in October.</p>
        <p>In its third year under the umbrella of the Long Island Film and TV Foundation, the Nassau-based International Film Expo is meant to bring industry to the area. In that goal it is similiar to the Long Island Film Festival, which began 17 years ago as an Island-wide effort, but currently grows out of the Suffolk County's Office of Economic Development.</p>
        <p>''We want to keep our local filmmakers here and attract others from all over the world and convince them to make their films on the Island,'' said Debra Markowitz, director of cinema-TV promotion for the Nassau County Department of Commerce and Industry. ''It brings jobs and money here.''</p>
        <p>''Jingle Hell,'' a first-time feature produced and co-written by Carter Ann McGowan of Garden City and directed by Will Tully of Hampton Bays, spent about $150,000 on the Island, shooting in Quogue, Smithtown, St. James, Mattituck and Hampton Bays. The comedy, about a family reunion, had its premiere at the Long Island Film Festival and will be screened in Malverne and Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons event was created in part to provide off-season business in the resort area.</p>
        <p>''As your festival grows, and along with it your level of notoriety, you attract more established filmmakers and more people from out of town who stay at local hotels and eat at local restaurants,'' said Alan Inkles, director of the Stony Brook event, which began five years ago as a way of keeping the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University productive in the summer. Mr. Inkles emphasizes independent films, with the goal of eventually joining the ranks of major festivals like the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and the Toronto International Festival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inkles believes he is approaching that level. Three established distributors have given him films that will make their New York premieres in Stony Brook before starting commercial runs. They are ''Thomas and the Magic Railroad,'' a live action-animated family film with Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda; ''Steal This Movie,'' based on the life of Abbie Hoffman, with Vincent D'Onofio and Janeane Garofolo, and ''Mr. Rice's Secret,'' a Canadian coming-of-age drama with David Bowie.</p>
        <p>The Cinema Arts Center's fourth annual Huntington International Film Festival is intended to address a problem for foreign films.</p>
        <p>''With this international globalization of filmmaking -- a few big companies controlling the production and distribution in the whole industry -- we're seeing the death of national cinema all over the world,'' said Charlotte Skye, co-founder and co-director of the center.</p>
        <p>''Those of us who grew up on Fellini and Bergman couldn't do that anymore,'' added Vic Skolnick, her co-founder and co-director. ''Only the foreign films that look like potential big box office hits are distributed now and most of them are dubbed.''</p>
        <p>The Long Island International Film Expo 2000 will be held Friday through July 20 at the Malverne Cinema 4 on Hempstead Avenue. For a schedule: (516) 561-3168.</p>
        <p>The 2000 Stony Brook Festival is from July 19 to 29 at the Staller Center on the Stony brook campus of the State University. (631) 632-2787.</p>
        <p>The Huntington International Film Festival is from July 28 through 30 at the Cinema Arts Center on Park Avenue. (631) 423-3456.</p>
