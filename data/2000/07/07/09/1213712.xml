        <p>It's been nearly half a century, but Edward Karen's memory is still sharp as he recalls those hazy, humid days when he and his family would pack sandwiches, towels, sandals and a large blanket and set off by bus from their South Bronx neighborhood in search of serenity.

        <p>He clearly remembers the sight of the sand and water and how the enthusiasm would bubble up inside him as he ran to the water. He smiles at the thought of riding out into the cold water on his father's wiry shoulders, then gathering up the courage to dive in.

        <p>It's been nearly half a century, but Edward Karen's memory is still sharp as he recalls those hazy, humid days when he and his family would pack sandwiches, towels, sandals and a large blanket and set off by bus from their South Bronx neighborhood in search of serenity. Their destination was Orchard Beach, a sliver of sand amid lush tidal marshes and woodlands, a place utterly foreign to the concrete confines where he grew up.</p>
        <p>He clearly remembers the sight of the sand and water and how the enthusiasm would bubble up inside him as he ran to the water. He smiles at the thought of riding out into the cold water on his father's wiry shoulders, then gathering up the courage to dive in. And how his father, a baker who had moved the family to the Bronx from Germany, would sleep for hours under the shade of the trees in Section 13, on the far southern end of the beach.</p>
        <p>''We had the freedom here,'' said Mr. Karen, peering at the glistening water from under a baseball cap. ''My dad would fish over there on those rocks, and we'd run around like crazy. I especially enjoyed that wall. Skunks would hang around there, and we'd chase them. It was great.'' Mr. Karen, a bus driver whose route takes him through the Bronx and who likes to take his breaks on Orchard Beach, said he often thinks back to those times. ''Those are the memories,'' he said, ''great memories.''</p>
        <p>Brooklyn may have Coney Island, with its creaky Cyclone and honky-tonk sensibilities, and Queens may have the Rockaways, with its crashing waves and miles of shoreline. In the Bronx, residents have a less conspicuous oasis, a workingman's Southampton where the water is sometimes as still as a pond and the view onto Long Island Sound includes High Island's radio tower and the massive columns of the Throgs Neck Bridge.</p>
        <p>But like its rivals on the Atlantic, the 1.1-mile-long crescent in Pelham Bay Park represents a link to the past for those who have made it their rite of summer, a constant in a borough that has lost so much, from landmarks like the Loews Paradise Theater to neighborhoods plowed over when the Cross Bronx Expressway came through.</p>
        <p>Here, the memories abound, of learning to swim under the watchful eye of a parent. Or that first kiss at the end of the boardwalk. Or of family barbecues on the sand, before they were banned.</p>
        <p>At Orchard Beach, people remember summer days when their apartments felt like steam baths, and how a trip here meant not just relief but an escape from a harder-edged world. Here, they had soft sand, water gently lapping against their feet, and laughing gulls -- rather than pigeons -- fluttering overhead. They could squint into the sun and, in the distance, see the lush green of Hart Island. It was, city officials said after Parks Commissioner Robert Moses ordered  that a beach be built in the Bronx, the Riviera of New York City, and who could argue?</p>
        <p>Since its opening in 1936, the beach has always had a Bronx edge. In the early days, Jewish folk singers from the borough's teeming Eastern European neighborhoods brought their mandolins. Later, from the 1960's on, as waves of Puerto Ricans sought new lives in the Bronx, the beach became known to many as the Puerto Rican Riviera. These days, musicians with congas and maracas wail away on the boardwalk, singing Afro-Cuban music, while families lugging containers with garlicky chicken and rice and beans carve out their own terrain among the sea of people who arrive on weekends.</p>
        <p>Carmen E. Guzman, 49, who was raised by a Puerto Rican mother in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, has enjoyed it all: the dancing and music on the boardwalk, the relaxing atmosphere in Sections 1 and 13 on the northern and southern reaches of the beach (no radios or beer allowed here), the family gatherings under the trees behind the beach.</p>
        <p>''I've been coming here since I was 3.'' explained Ms. Guzman, who was relaxing on the beach after a swim. Ms. Guzman, who still lives in the Bronx, said she often thinks back to the days when her mother, Juanita Rodriguez, and her brothers and sisters made the bus trip to Orchard Beach. She recalls the ride on the narrow bridge over Eastchester Bay and how the bus wound along a countrylike road so unlike the gritty streets back home.</p>
        <p>They got off at the bus terminal near the beach, and she and her siblings scampered through the concrete pillars built by the mighty Mr. Moses. Then, anticipation building, they took the few steps down the wide granite stairway and ran for the water.</p>
        <p>She remembers how frightened she first was of the water and how she later came to love it. As a young mother, she brought her sons. And these days, when she visits with her fiance, Joseph Henn, 60, it still holds promise. ''This was always peaceful to me,'' Ms. Guzman explained. ''I always loved to swim and go in the water. It cleanses you.''</p>
        <p>For Pat Mulhern, who has lived 39 years in the Bronx, visiting the beach is the continuation of a tradition that stretches four generations, a ritual that began when she, her parents and the neighbors would leave their Manhattan apartment for a day at the beach. ''We would come over here, all of us from the neighborhood, about 30 of us,'' she said. ''We would get up at 6 o'clock in the morning because we had to take the bus and wanted to be here by 8.''</p>
        <p>Now, another generation is enjoying Orchard Beach. On a recent day, Ms. Mulhern and her husband, Artie Mulhern, sat at water's edge, watching as their grandchildren, Artiana Katechis, 10, and Ryan Mulhern, 3, dug through the sand.</p>
        <p>Not all Orchard Beach memories, of course, are pleasant. Mr. Mulhern remembered the time his two sons, then 5 and 7, called him over to the water. ''They found a body right there,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Others remember fights, some of them racially motivated, that broke out in the 1960's, giving the place a dangerous edge.</p>
        <p>These days, though, Orchard Beach retains much of the good feel of its past. A $13 million, multiyear facelift financed by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer's office and the City Parks Department was completed this year, restoring the imperial colonnades, the palacelike terrace overlooking the pavilion, the grand bathhouses and the playgrounds and ball courts.</p>
        <p>For many, it is another sign that little has changed, at least in this little slice of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Anibal Cintron, 35, knows the ritual well, having made Orchard Beach a weekend destination for years. A teacher by training, a musician at heart, Mr. Cintron comes to pound away on a conga, singing and laughing the afternoon away with like-minded musicians.</p>
        <p>''People come here to get together, to respect each other,'' he said. ''It's a sense of community here, a sense of place. You come and have a few drinks, have a good time, hear some music. It's a way of getting away from it all.''</p>
