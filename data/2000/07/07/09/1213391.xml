        <p>TO avoid being swamped in its own popularity and rising real estate prices, this historic resort island has tightened its already demanding rules on residential development. As of this spring, fewer building permits are being issued and almost no historic structures razed in an effort to manage growth so that new houses enhance, rather than overwhelm, the architectural and natural environment</p>
        <p>This island, settled in 1642, is filled with historic buildings set in beguiling natural settings. Still, 18th-century villages dot a landscape encircled by ocean and threaded with ponds, woods and fields. Federalist mansions line narrow Edgartown streets, Victorian cottages cluster around lagoons in Oak Bluffs and Georgian manor houses still grace erstwhile West Tisbury and Chilmark farms while early 20th-century fishing shacks overlook Aquinnah's shores.</p>
        <p>But increasingly, wealthy buyers are racing to scoop up the limited supply of home sites. In their rush, some tear down old houses and block shoreline vistas to erect big luxury homes known derisively as McMansions. Soaring land and house costs, meanwhile, are pricing local working people out of the market.</p>
        <p>In response, this spring five of the island's six towns voted to adopt limitations on construction of new buildings. Only Tisbury voted the limits down.</p>
        <p>This year, only 243 building permits will be issued for new houses in all five towns (the average number issued since 1983).  Islandwide, including all six towns, 339 permits were issued in 1998, the last year for which statistics are available, according to Charles W. Clifford, director of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, the island planning agency. Aquinnah will issue 6, Chilmark 18, West Tisbury 54, Edgartown 93 and Oak Bluffs about 72, Mr. Clifford said.</p>
        <p>''These first islandwide caps will be reviewed in three years,'' he added. ''We're aiming to moderate development, give towns time to assess today's fast growth and pass better rules to handle it.''</p>
        <p>To promote the preservation of historic structures, open space and the production of lower-cost housing, most towns offer height and density bonuses for projects that further those goals. In Aquinnah and neighboring Chilmark, meanwhile, plans for any new house must undergo extensive review by a special town commission, while no building may be torn down without first obtaining a demolition permit.</p>
        <p>Owners can still build if they submit to a one-  or two-year approval process and plan a modest house, said Jerry Weiner, the Aquinnah building inspector. ''Anyone who wants to make this fragile outpost theirs must be willing to slow down to examine the issues we face,'' he said. ''Recently, too many have built big houses that scar the land and burden the infrastructure without realizing it.''</p>
        <p>But with many islanders working in the real estate industry, not all favor the caps on construction. ''When supply is low, caps drive up prices,'' said Arthur Smadbeck, an owner of Priestly &amp; Smadbeck Real Estate of Tisbury. ''This exacerbates our affordable housing shortage. We just closed a unit in the nursing home for lack of workers.''</p>
        <p>The nearby island of Nantucket, where the median house price is $900,000, faces similar dilemmas, said Jack H. Dunn, the island's building inspector. Each day, 400 workers are brought in from Hyannis on Cape Cod. ''It's a serious problem when we have to fly our bus drivers and cashiers in on a shuttle flight every day,'' Mr. Dunn said.</p>
        <p>INDEED, the churning real-estate market has ''caused an onslaught of teardowns and gut rehabs that imperil the historic island's character,'' according to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Last month, it placed Nantucket on a list of America's 11 most endangered historic places, despite islanders' attempts to save its architectural heritage.</p>
        <p>Since the 1950's, Nantucket's Historic District Commission has approved the exterior appearance of all new structures. A 1997 building cap has limited new house construction; this year, 110 building permits will be issued. This fall, Mr. Dunn said, voters will consider a new growth management plan that will further restrict new construction based on a point system that favors affordable housing.</p>
        <p>On Cape Cod this April, Provincetown tied new building permits to the water supply, a limit of about 12 a year, half the previous amount. In 1998, Falmouth also halved the number of permits; this year it will approve 200 building permits, said Brian Curry, the town planner. These historic resorts are under similar market pressures. On Martha's Vineyard last year there were 1,070 sales of land and houses, up from 494 in 1990, according to the Martha's Vineyard Land Bank Commission. The median single-family sale price is $700,000, with the high end up to $11 million and the low end disappearing, Mr. Smadbeck said.</p>
        <p>With land often priced at $1 million an acre and new construction at least $300 a square foot, even a modest new 3,000-square-foot house can cost close to $2 million, brokers and architects say.</p>
        <p>Each town has a somewhat different set of construction rules, but they all aim to encourage the construction of ''island friendly'' houses.</p>
        <p>In Oak Bluffs, the new cap was added to 12-year-old historic preservation rules that require Victorian styling and new houses of only three bedrooms in some neighborhoods. To fit in, Dr. and Mrs. Arthur Spielvogel of Ridgewood, N.J., had Peter Breese Architects design a 3,000-square-foot house on a lagoon with cedar shingles and an old-fashioned screened-in porch. While the house has a traditional Victorian exterior, an open interior layout gives it a spacious feel.</p>
        <p>West Tisbury's new zoning code, adopted  this spring, expanded the historic district to embrace 120 properties, up from 12; adopted a building cap: and now requires a permit for all demolition, a requirement that recently stopped one buyer from tearing down a 1600's tavern. The new code also suspends a three-acre zoning requirement to preserve farmland and promote lower-priced housing.</p>
        <p>West Tisbury wants more projects like Island Co-Housing, which is just being completed in the woods off North Road. On four  acres of a 30-acre site, John Abrams, who owns the South Mountain Company, developed 16 single-family houses priced from $125,000 to $310,000. Privately, the 16 families raised funds to subsidize the lower-priced units.</p>
        <p>''I'm in heaven,'' said Christie Phillips, 38. A year-round resident who designs interiors and clothing, she moved in with her two sons this spring after a seven-year housing search. ''I have a gem of a house and a real neighborhood here with a pond, playground and community house.''</p>
        <p>In rural Chilmark, development bonuses also go to low-cost housing and salvaging historic structures. Starting in 1990, Ben Clark, a historic preservationist, and his wife, Suzanne, disassembled, board by board, the manor that Simon Athearn had built in 1730 on his farm in West Tisbury. The Clarks were allowed to add a 300-square-foot addition for a new kitchen to the reconstructed house.</p>
        <p>And to be historically accurate, the house, reconstruction of which was completed last year, is 28 feet high -- a 4-foot height bonus over what would be allowed by current regulations.</p>
