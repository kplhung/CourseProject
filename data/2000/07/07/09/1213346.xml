        <p>Profile of French circus couple Antoine Rigot and Agathe Olivier, who met at Annie Fratellini's National Circus School in Paris in 1979 and formed in one-ring circus Les Colporteurs in 1996; their 1997 theatrical work Fialo is set to open in New York as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000; photo (M)</p>

        <p>YOU can't just run away and join the circus in France these days. First you have to go to school, one of some 500 circus schools of varying degrees of excellence that have sprung up across the land to serve the nouveau cirque, or new circus, movement. Then, with whatever skills you have honed, you go looking for a job in one of 300 circuses currently operating here. Finally, after a few years of touring as an employee, yes, you may run away -- to create your own troupe.</p>
        <p>So it was for Antoine Rigot and Agathe Olivier. The French husband-and-wife team met at Annie Fratellini's National Circus School in Paris in 1979 and spent long years performing their high-wire act for other companies, including the renowned Cirque du Soleil of Montreal during a three-year American tour in the mid-1980's. By 1996, when they formed Les Colporteurs (meaning peddlers or hawkers), they, too, wanted to do something different.</p>

        <p>YOU can't just run away and join the circus in France these days. First you have to go to school, one of some 500 circus schools of varying degrees of excellence that have sprung up across the land to serve the nouveau cirque, or new circus, movement. Then, with whatever skills you have honed, you go looking for a job in one of 300 circuses currently operating here. Finally, after a few years of touring as an employee, yes, you may run away -- to create your own troupe.</p>
        <p>So it was for Antoine Rigot and Agathe Olivier. The French husband-and-wife team met at Annie Fratellini's National Circus School in Paris in 1979 and spent long years performing their high-wire act for other companies, including the renowned Cirque du Soleil of Montreal during a three-year American tour in the mid-1980's. By 1996, when they formed Les Colporteurs (meaning peddlers or hawkers), they, too, wanted to do something different.</p>
        <p>The result was ''Filao,'' a one-ring spectacle of acrobatics, humor and music, performed by four women and three men. Well received when it had its premiere in 1997, ''Filao'' -- the name of a tropical hardwood as well as a pun on fil-a-haut, or high wire -- has since been presented more than 200 times in France and neighboring countries. Now, after performances at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C., and in Raleigh, N.C., the show is opening this week in New York as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000.</p>
        <p>The piece was inspired by Italo Calvino's short novel ''The Baron in the Trees,'' which tells of a young aristocrat who, disgusted with the world, climbs a tree on the family estate and never comes down. But for all the moments of absurdity or philosophical insight, ''Filao'' is still circus; it must, in the absence of elephants and tigers, provide moments of danger for the big-top crowd. And here the trapeze artists do not disappoint, flying, twisting, spinning and catching with immaculate timing that underlines their years of practice. This being nouveau cirque, though, they execute their feats to music and with considerable theatricality, ''debating and challenging each other between earth and sky,'' as the French daily Liberation put it.</p>
        <p>Certainly, for Mr. Rigot, who is the troupe's artistic director, what is most appealing about nouveau cirque is just that: the mixing of art forms that can turn a circus into a theater or a concert hall or a street corner. And like Les Arts Sauts, the French nouveau cirque troupe that performed at last year's festival, Les Colporteurs are turning Lincoln Center into a circus, setting up their 49-foot-high big top, with bleacher seats for 550 people, in Damrosch Park, beginning with a preview on Tuesday. The performance on July 22 will be the very last one of ''Filao.''</p>
        <p>''Filao,'' though, has served them well, not only earning them a solid reputation in France but also enabling them to create a tightly knit team of acrobats and musicians. Mr. Rigot, 38, and Ms. Olivier, 43, who have two children, were the original tightrope artists, doing both perilous and funny turns in the air and on the ground. But a swimming injury has sidelined Mr. Rigot, whose role is now performed by David Dimitri. Kathleen Reynolds, a native New Yorker, is described as a dancer, although she does far more, while four others are aerialists and trapeze artists. Carl Schlosser, one of the show's three musicians, also composed the score.</p>
        <p>A key figure for ''Filao,'' though, was Laszlo Hudi, a Hungarian experimental theater director who had helped Mr. Rigot and Ms. Olivier create a work called ''Amore Captus,'' which they toured for two years before founding Les Colporteurs. When they decided to use ''The Baron in the Trees,'' they again turned to Mr. Hudi for help.</p>
        <p>L ASZLO doesn't come up with ideas, he helps others develop their ideas,'' Mr. Rigot said one recent evening in his wooden caravan after a performance of ''Filao'' in Marseille. ''Laszlo's talent is to bring stories to life. So in this case, we did a sort of storyboard, picking out key words and images. We then asked everyone to write poems around them. And from these poems, we began to improvise. At first, it didn't produce much, but slowly, day by day, things emerged. Eventually, everything belonged to everyone.''</p>
        <p>In its final version, ''Filao'' is divided into 12 ''movements,'' each inspired by one of the poems and accompanied by music that was also created through improvisation. And by now, Calvino's novel is present only in a poetic sense. There are branches, trees and forests, there are struggles to overcome gravity, there are tables and chairs floating in the ether, as if life in the air were as natural as life on the ground. Indeed, why shouldn't a young woman take to the sky wearing a frilly evening dress and red high heels? It is just her misfortune that her arms and legs are attached to ropes that others pull on to turn her into a marionette.</p>
        <p>''The show is a mosaic of images evoking the same thing,'' Mr. Hudi explained, ''life on many levels, the horizontal, the vertical, emphasizing each performer's solitude and dependence on others.''</p>
        <p>For the future, having embraced the circus as metaphor, Mr. Rigot sees no limit to what can inspire him. For instance, imagine Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' adapted to the circus -- Inferno, Purgatory and Paradise all under the big top.</p>
        <p>''That,'' said the stocky, good-natured tightrope artist, ''is our next idea.''</p>
