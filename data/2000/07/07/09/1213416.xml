        <p>VIDEO has traditionally been the most tedious of the visual arts, for it has been frankly experimental. Video artists have generally not cared whether the audience watched them all the way through or not. For three decades tapes were commonly projected on ordinary television monitors and usually there was no place for viewers to sit down.</p>
        <p>A bench isn't always provided today either, but firm evidence that video art has undergone a scintillating transformation is provided by ''Speed of Vision,'' featuring 11 artists, at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield. Once again the museum's former life as a traditional house serves the show well. Artists who need one, get a room to themselves.</p>
        <p>But, most significantly, the museum enlisted a curator who believes that video art must be entertaining. Matthew Yablonsky, who doubles as exhibition designer at the Brooklyn Museum, has chosen work -- not all of it brand new -- that all passes the test of keeping viewers in the room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yablonsky has wisely included the artist who is considered the godfather of video art, Nam June Paik, who has often emphasized the hardware, the television monitor itself -- the blocky hardware -- as much as the content. His piece is dated 1974-2000, and one suspects that it is a pile of dirt that is fresh.</p>
        <p>Otherwise the work, ''Buddha Watching TV,'' is an unchanging meditation. A stone head of a buddha planted in the dirt contemplates the head of a golden buddha on the screen. The stated unifying theme of Mr. Yablonsky's show is the different aspects of time that video art can capture, and Mr. Paik's contribution stands for eternity.</p>
        <p>Nature's own sweet time is celebrated by Matthew McCaslin on 12 monitors arrayed on the floor. They make up a garden for each screen that carries the rich color image of a flower whose unfurling is greatly accelerated; then the flowers fold up again and the process is repeated. It's always spring. Authentically fast nature is the subject of Jessica Bronson's ''First and Last Strike.'' It's lightning flashes in an all-white room.</p>
        <p>A slower pace of nature is embodied in ''Breath,'' by the Japanese team who call themselves Eiko and Koma. Many video works are called installations, but that often means simply that a video screen has been installed in a room. Eiko and Koma's contribution is an installation in the sense that video is only one component, a central one but a deliberately vague one. Hazy video projections of the slow dance-like movements of the artists' bodies complement the extremely palpable surroundings, essentially frame for the projections, made of tea-stained silk, dried leaves and other organic materials. The atmosphere suggests a grotto or perhaps even a womb.</p>
        <p>Related to ''Breath'' are the three sculptural works created by Kathy Rose, all belonging to her series ''The Inn of Floating Imagery.'' Ms. Rose's innovation is the projection of images on pieces of fabric, which gives them even less tangibility than they would have projected on the usual screens. Her subject is dance movement: the dancer in ''Exquisite Corps 2000'' seems a hybrid of Japanese and Egyptian sources. Wall information discloses that animated drawing is mixed with the performing figure, adding to the aura of unreality. In the small, almost palm-size, ''Pond 2000'' the figure appears to melt.</p>
        <p>In the brochure accompanying the exhibition, Mr. Yablonsky writes that when a video work is installed in a large space it can be freed from the constraints of time. The most elaborate example of this is Doug Aitkin's ''Diamond Sea (Linear Version),'' which is 20 minutes long but has some of the earmarks of a major motion picture. It has an exotic location, Namibia, presented thoroughly in rich color. While political content is implied, in the business of diamond mining, Mr. Aitkin seems more eager to present the landscape as a many-faceted jewel. He beautifully presents the sea and the desert in wide screen, and the desert seems to roll like the surf. But he will cut abruptly from these panoramas to a close-up of a piece of pipe or other innocuous element, in an arrhythmic kind of expansion and contraction.</p>
        <p>A video program within the larger exhibition features five short films or excerpts from longer movies on the theme of space travel and outer space. NASA footage of John Glenn's pioneering space flight meets fictional drama from the movie ''The Right Stuff'' and even scary science fiction: the movie ''Event Horizon''</p>
        <p>Tom Kalin's ''Third Known Nest'' is a bittersweet reflection on the lives of gay men today, but a show at the Aldrich is always characterized by as few giddy moments. These are supplied by Jonas Akerlund in the form of an ambitious music video with a soundtrack provided by Madonna.</p>
        <p>The storyline is events of a single day in a big city speeded up and compressed into five minutes.</p>
        <p>''It's Coming Up,'' by Raphael Montanez Ortiz, is frenzied, sexual energy camouflaged in chaste, mundane activity.</p>
        <p>Richard Klein, the Aldrich's assistant director, says that Charles Atlas gets material for his work, including the five-monitor, ''Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha, Martha,'' by staying up all night watching cable television. Either Mr. Atlas is unbelievably assiduous, or he was lucky to come up with a wealth of footage with women named Martha in it. Among others, Martha Graham and Martha Stewart appear along with such fictional Marthas as in ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''</p>
        <p>It's definitely local time for Annika Eriksson, who gathered kilted members of a bagpipe and drum band composed of Fairfield County firefighters in the bare museum room where the resultant video is projected. They stalwartly perform a piece entitled, ''Sour Times.''</p>
        <p>''Speed of Vision'' is at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield through Sept. 6.</p>
