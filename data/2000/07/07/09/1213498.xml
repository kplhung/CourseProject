        <p>AT the Beacon Theater in Manhattan, during the 1987 New York Music Awards, the backstage was a madhouse. Stars were all over the place -- Miles Davis, Billy Joel, Vanessa Williams, Paul Simon. Photographers were flitting about. Performers paced nervously awaiting potential trophies. And a schoolmarmish Natalie Merchant, wearing glasses, sat on a chair in the midst of all the excitement, reading.</p>
        <p>Some call her pretentious, others find her refreshing. Whatever the case, Ms. Merchant is not your run-of-the-mill chanteuse. And her current tour, which will bring her to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, isn't standard Merchant fare.</p>
        <p>The enigmatic singer's career began in 1981 when she joined forces with some of her upstate New York colleagues to sing new-wave covers. But the hearty-voiced Ms. Merchant and her compatriots soon got the folk-rock bug and she led the outfit through an era when female folkies, like Suzanne Vega and Tracy Chapman, were becoming the rage. Her obvious influence was Fairport Convention's Sandy Denny, whose vocal style, down to the British inflection, closely replicated that of Fairport's legendary lead singer.</p>
        <p>The Maniacs were signed to Elektra Records in 1985 and released their debut, ''The Wishing Chair,'' (produced by Joe Boyd of Fairport fame). After a producer change (Peter Asher) for 1987's ''In My Tribe'' and 1989's ''Blind Man's Zoo,'' the band began to find commercial success, with ''Zoo'' certifying platinum. Songs like ''What's the Matter Here,'' (like Ms. Vega's ''Luka,'' an unlikely hit about child abuse), ''Hey, Jack Kerouac'' and ''Like the Weather'' became alternative radio hits. A remake of Cat Stevens's ''Peace Train'' also received significant air play.</p>
        <p>The distinctive mix of folk and alternative rock music helped the band achieve great success and Ms. Merchant's English Lit-major persona, midtempo ballads, sonorous vocals and dervish spinning while singing attracted scores of young female fans who would soon find a home with Lilith Fair.</p>
        <p>Several other albums were released, but none really achieved the innovative approach the Maniacs were credited with. It was becoming obvious that this nouveau diva was becoming too big for the group. In September 1993, Ms. Merchant departed to pursue a solo career, insisting that there was no ill will between the members of the group, declaring her departure as ''a natural passage.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Merchant, who collaborated on songwriting in the past, was now free to write her own material. Her 1995 solo debut, ''Tigerlily,'' (on which she reflected on the band's breakup on ''I May Know the Word'') displayed a more confident singer, but a watered-down sound.</p>
        <p>As a solo act, Ms. Merchant concentrated more on having her mannered vocals mixed upfront in the production, and less on the textured backup instrumentation she had with the Maniacs. It might have been time for her to take a place in the spotlight, but it was glaringly harsh. The result for many was a somnambulistic recording with lyrics that were too serious, never offering much-needed irony.</p>
        <p>But many fans thought they had found folk-rock nirvana with songs like ''Jealousy,'' a buoyant pop tune reminiscent of 10,000 Maniacs, and ''Carnival,'' with its Latin groove. The album reached the Top 20 on the charts and established Ms. Merchant as one of the top female pop artists of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The follow-up, 1998's ''Ophelia,'' was a more ambitious, partly successful attempt to broaden her musical and lyrical scope. The music was more lush than the previous spare and tentative ''Tigerlily.'' She recently released a ''Live in Concert'' album.</p>
        <p>But now, in her most recent tour, Ms. Merchant is going back to her roots (as if appropriating Ms. Denny's vocals weren't enough) by stealing a page from Nanci Griffith's career book and performing the folk songs that have influenced and intrigued her.</p>
        <p>She performs classics like ''Poor Wayfaring Stranger'' and the union anthem ''Which Side Are You On?'' in a format for which her husky, melancholic voice is well-suited -- guileless melodies, unadorned poetry and truthful harmonies -- the music of America.</p>
        <p>But in the second half of her show she returns to her own material (''Carnival'' and ''Jack Kerouac'') and other contemporary songs, like Lucinda Williams's easygoing, sultry ''Sweet Old World.''</p>
        <p>Live, Ms. Merchant is less dour than on album, and maybe the schoolmarm in her is ready to yield to some summer fun.</p>
        <p>NATALIE MERCHANT  WILCO  New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark.  Tonight at 7:30.  (888) 466-5722.</p>
