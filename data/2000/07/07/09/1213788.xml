        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The most intriguing part of Hugh Brogan's recent diatribe against my book ''Dawning of the Raj'' (June 11) is the last paragraph, in which he says that Lord Macaulay's ''justly famous essay'' on Warren Hastings ''has a judgment and an enjoyable energy Bernstein cannot match.'' I wonder if Brogan is referring to a sentence like ''What the horns are to the buffalo, what the paw is to the tiger, what the sting is to the bee, what beauty, according to the old Greek song, is to woman, deceit is to the Bengalee.'' By Jove, that does have an enjoyable energy, sort of like a lynching.</p>

        <p>Macaulay was a thoroughgoing racist who thought that any bookshelf of English literature was worth the entire output of India, and that the best service one could do for the poor Indians was to give them a good British education. His 150-year-old error-filled essay is to most people who work in this field at best a sort of entertainment. Most of us go through a Macaulay phase, and most of us outgrow it. That Brogan has not tells us something about his qualifications to review a book like this.</p>
