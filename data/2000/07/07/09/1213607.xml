        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You ask whether a campaign to eradicate syphilis can succeed when it requires reaching ''people who tend to be alienated enough from government and even medical officials that some resist even efforts to test and cure them'' (news article, July 4).</p>
        <p>This question also applies to other infectious diseases. These include H.I.V. and hepatitis C, which are present in many sectors of our population, and tuberculosis, which is confined mostly to marginal groups.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You ask whether a campaign to eradicate syphilis can succeed when it requires reaching ''people who tend to be alienated enough from government and even medical officials that some resist even efforts to test and cure them'' (news article, July 4).</p>
        <p>This question also applies to other infectious diseases. These include H.I.V. and hepatitis C, which are present in many sectors of our population, and tuberculosis, which is confined mostly to marginal groups.</p>
        <p>The kind of outreach you describe is an essential part of the effort to control such diseases. Another is reducing the forces that alienate people from mainstream medical resources and increasing their ability to protect their own health. Treating drug addicts with the respect and compassion due any patient who seeks medical care and providing easy access to sterile injection equipment are vital as well.</p>
