        <p>The senior doctor in charge of my team of residents flashed a confident smile to the young doctors who trailed behind him as we walked through the medical ward. ''We have the ability to make sure these people die from old age,'' he said. ''I can make sure these people live a normal life, indefinitely.''</p>
        <p>If we had been on any of the hospital's other wards, the optimism of this doctor, an infectious disease specialist, might have seemed appropriate. But this was a floor for patients infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. For these patients, life under even the best of circumstances is far from normal. And to health officials tracking the alarming increases in the number of new H.I.V. infections, my colleague's statements might have seemed careless, if not negligent.</p>
        <p>Last month, researchers working in San Francisco reported a small but sharp rise in new H.I.V. infections among gay men over the last three years, a trend that doctors fear is mirrored in other major cities. The estimated annual number of new infections in San Francisco, which had stabilized after aggressive prevention campaigns, nearly doubled in 1999. These findings and others to be presented this week at the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, indicate that the number of new infections per year in the United States may be on the rise.</p>
        <p>The reason is not hard to see. Amid the din of glowing reports of new drug therapies, many people at risk for contracting H.I.V. have become complacent about the consequences of AIDS. At the same time, doctors and medical researchers have been overconfident and even misleading about their ability to treat H.I.V. and help those infected to lead ''normal'' lives.</p>
        <p>At a conference in San Francisco this past winter, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control reported that optimistic statements and hyperbolic press reports had extinguished fear about behavior, like unprotected sex and intravenous drug abuse, that is known to spread the virus. The C.D.C. found that more than 30 percent of those at high risk for contracting H.I.V. said they were less concerned about AIDS than they had previously been, and therefore less likely to take precautions. Many study participants ascribed their renewed risk taking to a growing confidence that a cure was close at hand.</p>
        <p>But my own experience with the best antiviral medicine has me disbelieving the unfettered optimism of so many of my medical colleagues.</p>
        <p>Late one night last fall, I was working in the emergency room when an errant motion and a careless decision to recap a bloody needle left me with a gash in my hand. My patient admitted to promiscuity and had received multiple blood transfusions in the early 1980's. She was at high risk of being H.I.V.-positive, and so I was prescribed four days of ''triple therapy'' with the latest protease inhibitors and other antiviral medicines.</p>
        <p>The patient ultimately tested negative. But those four days left me with a realistic view of what infected patients often face. Between nausea and aching pains in my bones, I felt febrile and weak. I was unable to exercise. After one day, I was no longer well enough to work, to go out with my friends or to eat a full meal without vomiting. While it is true that over time some people are able to tolerate the drugs better than others, for many patients these symptoms never go away.</p>
        <p>Many doctors -- and the pharmaceutical industry -- have failed to convey the human toll that ''triple therapy'' takes, especially as people at risk read the press coverage about amazing new molecules to attack the virus and the optimistic statements from some doctors. Those at the C.D.C. say that this lessening of fear about death has resulted in a decrease in concern about contracting H.I.V. For many of us, AIDS has become a seemingly distant phenomenon, more rumored than real, despite the increasing numbers of new infections.</p>
        <p>Early success has bred complacency and a resurgence in risky behavior. A price is being paid because doctors have not been fully honest with their patients or each other.</p>
