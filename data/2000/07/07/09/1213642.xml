        <p>Rye is negotiating a package with its new city manager to pay her more than $160,000 over five years for housing, Mayor Steven Otis said. A search firm hired by the city to find a new manager told Rye officials that increasingly communities with high housing costs were offering housing allowances in order to attract qualified candidates. Mayor Otis said the median price of a house in Rye is $649,500, with the average sale price last year reaching $840,700. Rye's charter requires that its city manager live in the municipality. The city manager, Julia Novak, is living in a rented house in Rye until the housing allowance is negotiated, the Mayor said. Meanwhile, the city is paying $2,700 a month for a short-term home rental for Ms. Novak, her husband and two children.</p>
