        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman (''A Modest Proposal,'' column, July 7) has one-upped me with his proposal that Al  Gore select Bill Clinton as his vice-presidential running mate. Here I've been telling all my friends and relatives, and whoever wants to listen, that Bill Clinton is a cinch as the next secretary of state, no matter who wins the presidency.</p>

        <p>Bill Clinton is a very popular man,  mainly because of his humanitarian views and the ease with which he has  managed to keep ultraconservatives in check and the economy rolling  along like a well-oiled machine. If  there were no law denying him the right to run again, he might have gained a third term as president with the greatest landslide in history. True, he has been a sinner, but after all is said and done, aren't we all?</p>
