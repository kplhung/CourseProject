        <p>Look carefully at the class pictures in the lobby of France's National School of Administration and you can find just about everyone who counts in French politics today -- back when they all still had hair.</p>
        <p>For more than four decades, this school, dedicated to shaping top students for a life in government, has done just that with enormous success. Two of France's last three presidents and six of its last eight prime ministers have been graduates.</p>
        <p>It has not been easy to get into this state-subsidized finishing school for the elite, known here as ENA. The exams are legendary in their difficulty. The odds of success have sometimes been as high as 200 to 1. But not today.</p>
        <p>In an undeniable sign of all that is changing in France, the number of applicants to the school has dropped 30 percent in the last four years alone, despite the guarantee of a high-powered government job on graduation.</p>
        <p>These days, France has perhaps the fastest growing economy in Europe. The government is privatizing many of its assets. The stock market is booming. International mergers seem to occur every week and successful start-ups are making overnight millionaires of people who have not gone the traditional routes. Suddenly, it is acceptable to talk openly about making money.</p>
        <p>Government work, once considered the epitome of power and prestige here, is no longer, it seems, so desirable.</p>
        <p>''If there is a disaffection with ENA, there is indeed a revolution going on,'' said Jean d'Ormesson, a prominent French intellectual and writer. ''All the young ones think only of starting their own businesses. It's almost dangerous because some will certainly fail. But there is an energy out there and it refuses to be contained by bureaucracy.''</p>
        <p>Even ENA officials, scrambling to overhaul both the school's recruitment and its curriculum, feel that the mood in France is against them.</p>
        <p>''There is no question that today this kind of training looks less attractive to some young people,'' said Raymond-Francois Le Bris, the school's director. ''Working for the state seems heavy. It does not seem to represent the right market values to them.''</p>
        <p>In France, ''serving the state'' has always been held highly. And in the recent past, as the country struggled with a sluggish economy and double-digit inflation, it was also where the young and ambitious turned, as long as they could master the rigid advance-through-tests procedures.</p>
        <p>The current crop of ENA students still talk about doing more with their lives than earning fortunes. ''A few years ago when I had the choice -- private industry or this -- I decided that I would rather be of service than sell yogurt or a car,'' said Roland Husson, 24, who would like a career in diplomacy.</p>
        <p>But surveys show that France's young people are far more likely to be in awe of the director of a fledgling Internet company working out of a maid's room than of the high-powered functionaries their parents so admired. They are also more often risk takers ready to bet on their own creativity.</p>
        <p>A recent survey of students in a dozen of France's most prestigious schools found that about 12 percent wanted to start their own companies as soon as they got out of school.  Another 40 percent wanted to start their own business sometime in their lifetime.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, you just got in the pipeline: there was very little of the self-made man,'' said Jerome Chapuisat, the director of the government agency that provides students with information about educational options. ''We haven't completely destroyed that system yet. But it is beginning to crumble from the inside.''</p>
        <p>While the National School of Administration ponders how to remake itself, other schools are thriving.</p>
        <p>In Paris, for instance, is a private computer and telecommunications college, known from its inital as Epita, where the number of applicants has grown by 25 percent each of the last three years, even though students must pay about $4,500 a year for their schooling. The National School of Administration is free.</p>
        <p>The corridors of Epita do not gleam like those at ENA, which is housed in an artfully renovated 19th-century prison in Strasbourg not far from the European Parliament. At Epita, the worn carpeting buckles.</p>
        <p>But the classrooms, packed with computer terminals, never shut down. The government's effort to reduce the workweek to 35 hours is routinely ridiculed here. Nicolas Margaine, a second-year Epita student, said he spent more time than that in one of the school's labs cruising the Internet for interesting new sites and ideas.</p>
        <p>At Epita, the dream is to start your own business before graduation, and to make millions by the time you are 35. ''We are going for it full speed, no fear,'' Mr. Margaine said. ''Doing a start-up doesn't scare us. It would be great to go like crazy for 10 or 15 years, make a lot of money and then relax.''</p>
        <p>Some educators say that France's whole system of education and promotion, once heavily reliant on tests and schools like ENA, is beginning to be questioned. Private schools are drawing more and more students; educators say they are better able to adapt to the market.</p>
        <p>''The big schools like ENA are not as recognized as they were,'' said Dominique Herault, an Education Ministry official who writes reports on educational trends. ''They are not considered as important as 10 or 20 years ago. The whole spectrum of information and commerce is seeing an increase. Even the whole idea that security is a job in a big company is not the same anymore.''</p>
        <p>As the country's most prestigious school, ENA has faced some of the harshest criticism. The school was founded by Charles de Gaulle after World War II. He wanted the very best French minds to fill out the bureaucracy. The curriculum focused on ordering and presenting ideas. But in recent years it has come under heavy attack as an out-of-date institution that produces a group of elites who think alike, speak alike and protect each other, with little feel for the average citizen. Directly and indirectly, it has been blamed whenever the government seems out of touch with real life.</p>
        <p>Under the current system, after spending 27 months at the school, students are offered lifelong employment with the government. In fact, based on their test scores, they were able to pick whatever job they wanted. They are often in top management positions by their mid-20's, though they have little or no hands-on experience.</p>
        <p>The school's graduates have lately become the butt of many jokes. In one, implying that ENA technocrats do not see things very clearly, a young man stops by a herd of sheep and bets the shepherd he can count them at one glance. If he can do it, he gets to keep one. The young man gets the answer right and goes to collect his winnings. But the farmer offers a counter-bet. If he can tell the young man what school he attended, he gets to keep his animal. The young man agrees. ''ENA,'' says the farmer.</p>
        <p>''How did you know?'' asks the young man. ''Because that is my dog you've got under your arm.''</p>
        <p>The school, Mr. Le Bris insists, is still doing a good job. But he has overhauled its recruitment efforts, trying with new living stipends to reach a more diverse population than in the past. He has also made changes to the curriculum, including more courses on international relations, ethics, negotiation and European Union issues.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most noteworthy, he says, students must now devise and actually complete a project during their internships in government agencies. This could mean that they devise schedules for a road construction plan, or a way of running a department with 10 percent less staff.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to get away from that label that we analyze but we don't actually teach them to put their ideas to work,'' Mr. Le Bris said. ''We want them to have more contact with reality.''</p>
        <p>But the changes have not satisfied all the school's critics.</p>
        <p>Some say they do not yet go to the core of a system that is based on advancement through tests. One member of the school's board of directors, Jacques Julliard, quit recently and gave a copy of his resignation letter to a weekly magazine. In it, he asked ''whether it was normal, indeed even conceivable,'' that young people would ''through a test, with only their intellectual abilities on show, be able to get top jobs without any real life experience?''</p>
