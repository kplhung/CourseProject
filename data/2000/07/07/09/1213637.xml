        <p>BOOK ''The Victors'' by Stephen E. Ambrose (1999)</p>
        <p>WHY ''There is no better study in leadership than looking at it through the eyes of the troops on the front line, which Ambrose does so well, and I firmly believe that successfully revitalizing a company like Petsmart is fundamentally an exercise in leadership.''</p>
