        <p>LAST year, Anri Yasuda bought a Fendi baguette, the most coveted bag of the season. In a matter of weeks her purchase had lost its allure, becoming about as exciting to her as a plateful of warmed-over cabbage. ''With a luxury bag, you're bored of it after one season,'' said Ms. Yasuda, a philosophy major at Columbia University. ''That's when the new ones come out.''</p>
        <p>So nowadays, Ms. Yasuda, 19, feeds her passion for style and novelty by prowling the stands of the street vendors dotting Manhattan from upper Madison Avenue to the Lower East Side and Canal Street. A counterfeit python cowboy hat, a rayon ''pashmina'' -- if it looks good and the price is right (no more than $30), she'll take it. Recently, she expanded her list of desirable knockoffs to include high-status handbags. She's on the lookout for a fake Hermes Birkin bag. (The real thing is priced at $4,800 to $5,500.)</p>
        <p>''When I get tired of it, I'll put little stickers all over it to make it look special,'' she said. ''And if everyone has the same bag, so what?''</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Yasuda, Selma Scheinbach scours street vendors' stalls for bargains.</p>
        <p>''Street accessories are cheap and accessible,'' she said. ''You don't have to run all over the stores to find them.''</p>
        <p>''If I'm walking, I'm shopping,'' Ms. Scheinbach, who is in her 60's, added. ''Whether it's a hot dog or a handbag, if I see what I want on the corner, it's mine.''</p>
        <p>Both women are typical of a new breed of sidewalk shopper: consumers of evident style and means who can afford to pay retail but enjoy the thrill of adding a $30 counterfeit or two to their wardrobes. Where the shoppers stooping to inspect street merchandise were once mainly office workers and tourists, now they are as likely to be chic passers-by, clutching a genuine Prada shoulder bag or a tote emblazoned with real Gucci double G's.</p>
        <p>''The real shopper, you can tell who they are by their designer labels,'' said Christian, a vendor selling bags last week at Madison Avenue and 59th Street.</p>
        <p>The new upscale customer seems to be responding to an upgrade in the counterfeit merchandise that's available and a trend among done-it-all shoppers for cheap ''trophy'' purchases.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, sidewalk fakes were limited mainly to generic-looking black nylon ''Pradas'' and impostor ''Louis Vuittons.'' But styles today are more diverse, sophisticated and authentic-looking, among them the currently sought-after Prada bowling bag shapes, Kate Spade-style straw totes and minuscule evening bags that imitate Fendi and Judith Leiber designs. The counterfeits sell on the street for $20 to $50 or more, as against $250 to more than $5,000 for the designer originals. Where once only a handful of peddlers catered to the status-starved, now they crop up on every other block, staking out turf along Madison Avenue between 50th Street and 70th Street.</p>
        <p>''For some people, there is a certain badge value in getting things at a reasonable price,'' said Richard Leonard, vice president of the Zandl Group, a New York consumer research firm. ''If that item is actually counterfeit, bought in the street, to that consumer it really doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>He might have been describing Lauren Stax of Houston, a student at the University of Texas. Ms. Stax says she owns a genuine Kate Spade canvas bag.</p>
        <p>She also has a handsome Spade impostor, bought on the street. Poring over a table strewn with handbags at 59th and Madison, she said, ''I don't care if these are real or fake, and most people I know don't care, either.''</p>
        <p>Nor do many shoppers appear to be concerned that the vendors they buy from are flouting the law. Counterfeit accessories -- those with the logo or the identifiable colors and designs of brand-name bags and accessories -- violate Federal and local trademark laws. Moreover, the vendors who sell them are often unlicensed, subject to periodic sweeps by the New York City police, who confiscate their wares.</p>
        <p>But the laws are enforced only sporadically. On Madison Avenue Thursday, a security guard hired by the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District looked on serenely as, just yards away on 66th Street, a vendor peddled ''Tod's'' fake patent leather shoulder bags, plastic ''Vuitton'' clutches and canvas ''Gucci'' slings.</p>
        <p>Luxury makers are not amused. The International AntiCounterfeiting Coalition in Washington says counterfeiting has tripled in the last 10 years and now costs legitimate businesses $350 billion in annual sales. That figure encompasses auto parts as well as fashion accessories and is somewhat inflated, since many people who buy bogus goods might not have purchased the higher-priced originals. Nevertheless, counterfeit accessories cheapen the image of legitimate brands.</p>
        <p>Most high-end handbag look-alikes are made in China or Korea, the anticounterfeiting coalition says. Often, bogus logos and signature hardware are later glued, sewn or riveted on in the United States.</p>
        <p>Such telltale signs of counterfeiting as poorly sewn labels, inferior stitching and materials that reek of petroleum don't seem to deter many shoppers, especially the young. Ever alert for a bargain, ''they're more independent and less easily manipulated than some older shoppers are,'' said Mr. Leonard of the Zandl Group, ''and they are increasingly likely to shop in the streets.''</p>
        <p>Many shoppers turn to counterfeit wares out of disenchantment with legitimate brands. Posting a message at Hintmag.com, a fashion Web site aimed at young women, one disgruntled shopper wrote: ''Kate Spade bags are rectangular totes, done in different materials . . . yawn. They're very easy to make, no wonder all the counterfeits.''</p>
        <p>Most days of the week, such shoppers are likely to be found perusing the wares spread on sheets on Lexington Avenue near Bloomingdale's. There, imitation Prada ostrich purses and impostor Fendi baguettes lure shoppers young and old. But at the first hint of trouble -- the appearance of a security guard -- the merchandise goes under wraps, vanishing faster than Brigadoon.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Christian, who declined to give his last name for fear of arrest, displayed Coach and Kate Spade look-alikes. ''We had a police sweep yesterday, so I don't have my best merchandise,'' he said. ''On good days, we have Fendi, Prada, Gucci, you name it. And they sell for about $35.''</p>
        <p>As he talked he kept watch for potential customers, the ones already displaying designer labels, whom he claimed to be able to spot half a block away.</p>
        <p>''I try to stop the real shoppers,'' he said. ''The others, you try to get them, too. But you're not going to stress yourself.''</p>
        <p>It seems unlikely he would put himself out to attract Samantha Adam, a young tourist who writes for Madame Figaro, the French style weekly. She was eyeing the bags a little furtively as she stood on a corner waiting for a friend. Ms. Adam, who was simply dressed and showing no logos, said she shuns counterfeit bags.</p>
        <p>''I prefer to pay for the real one,'' she said. ''Even if it goes out of the trend right away.''</p>
        <p>But she conceded that certain kinds of merchandise might tempt her.</p>
        <p>''Shoes make me crazy,'' Ms. Adam said. ''Imagine if these people sold them in the street. A woman could really get wild.''</p>
