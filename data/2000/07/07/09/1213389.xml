        <p>HELMIT ZITZWITZ wears three hats. He organizes art exhibitions at his gallery and runs a framing business. But his main business is restoring oil paintings and works on paper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zitzwitz is German by birth -- born in Berlin in 1932. In 1980 he opened his first gallery in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He began studying art restoration with Gustave Berger, a man he believes  revolutionized the art of restoration.</p>
        <p>He now works with his wife, Barbara Zitzwitz, his partner in Dobbs Ferry. Hudson River Gallery and Conservators occupies two large, sun-filled rooms in a large Art Deco building, which also houses businesses as varied as a bagpipe maker and the cartoon bank for New Yorker magazine.</p>
        <p>He recently talked about his work, illustrating many of his points with examples from his ''before and after file.''</p>
        <p>Q. What exactly was Gustave Berger's major contribution to art restoration?</p>
        <p>A. In a word, reversibility. In the past varnishes were applied that couldn't be removed. Berger invented BEVA, Berger Ethylene Vinyl and Acetate. When heated this synthetic adhesive fuses together the layers of gauze, Mylar and linen with which the restorer lines the back of a painting. A subsequent restorer could undo this, reverse the process, by softening this lining.</p>
        <p>That's not all, though. Berger taught me more than technique. From him I learned fingerspitzen, which means something like ''the right touch.'' Restoration is much more than chemistry.</p>
        <p>Q. According to your resume, after studying with Berger you took courses in areas like mildew on textiles. What can you do with a mildewed painting?</p>
        <p>A. Nothing. And mildew is dangerous, something that's not well known.</p>
        <p>Q. Other than mildew is there anything else you won't take on?</p>
        <p>A. I won't touch a work on paper if there's any paper missing. Other restorers are better at that. But I can do ''deacidification'' and remove browning, things like that.</p>
        <p>Q. What is the most frequent problem you face concerning paper?</p>
        <p>A. Acid. Before the turn of the century, the 20th century, paper was made of organic materials such as cotton and linen. Then it began to be made of wood pulp, which contains enormous amounts of acid. The paper is guaranteed to deteriorate. And now constant recycling means that the fibers are getting shorter, which makes things more difficult.</p>
        <p>Q. What's the remedy?</p>
        <p>A. I must get a neutral pH reading, a neutral balance of acidity and alkalinity. To do this I wash and remove the stains. It may take up to four to six weeks. (A 20-by-24-inch painting may take eight weeks.). But paper's worst enemy is the framers and the materials they use. They use the wrong matting along with masking tape and transparent tape that are applied to the backs of frames.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there a noticeable difference between the durability of contemporary paintings and older ones?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, today's artists don't study the tried-and-true techniques. They try their own, and it's often a disaster.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there preventative measures the owner of an oil painting can take?</p>
        <p>A. Any good oil painting should get looked at by a restorer every 50 or 60 years. But, truthfully, it's always too late when a painting is brought in to me. But I usually rise to the occasion.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you relish hopeless cases?</p>
        <p>A. Recently, a man brought in a portrait of his mother. Others advised me not to touch it because it was in such bad shape, but also because it wasn't a very good painting. But it was the man's mother.</p>
        <p>She had recently died, and it got to me. I worked very hard. The man was very pleased, and that pleased me.</p>
        <p>Q. Any ''eureka'' discoveries?</p>
        <p>A. Here's a landscape that's beautiful in its own way. But I saw some shadows underneath. I started cleaning. After a while I called Barbara over and said, ''I think there may be rocks here.'' She said, ''Those aren't rocks, they're cows.'' I was able to call up the owner and ask if he wanted his painting with or without cows.</p>
        <p>Q. Framers with galleries are common, but isn't it unusual for a restorer to have a gallery?</p>
        <p>A. The other parts of our business pay the bills, so we can show what we like in the gallery. It gives us pleasure. A secondary reason is that it might bring in people who might then avail themselves of our services.</p>
        <p>Right now we're showing Yooan Park, who came from Korea to the United States in 1986. We've hung her large Sumi ink drawings all in a row down the center of the room. There were too many to fit on the walls. On the walls are smaller drawings in plexiglass boxes. When the gallery lights are on, the top edge of the box casts a distinct line across the drawing. I really regret that I cannot solve this problem.</p>
