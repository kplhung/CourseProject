        <p>MY husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation. One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place. We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see, we acquire real estate -- at least in our dreams.</p>
        <p>When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a book on architecture, and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of his fantasy vacations.) Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our children.</p>

        <p>MY husband, Larry, and I like to go house hunting on vacation. One minute we are behaving like proper tourists in Provence, Sydney or Prague, and the next we're making plans to live there. It's not enough to be seeing the sites, enjoying the culture, eating the food and drinking the wine; we have to own the place. We travel the way Caesar's army conquered Gaul; we come, we see, we acquire real estate -- at least in our dreams.</p>
        <p>When in Rome, Larry imagines himself sitting all day outside his apartment in the Piazza Navona. He is sipping cappuccino, reading a book on architecture, and smoking. (Larry resumes smoking on all of his fantasy vacations.) Larry does not have a job in Rome. I don't either, unless diving for coins in the Trevi Fountain counts. In order to keep our fantasy aloft, we have learned to avoid the little pinpricks of reality such as how we're going to make a living, what we'll do for friends, where to redeem our empty soda cans or what to do with our children.</p>
        <p>Not every vacation destination is good fantasy material. It may be a nice place to visit, but even inveterate dreamers wouldn't want to live there. Some places are too hot; some too cold. I'd be cutting sod in Ireland right now if it weren't for the bloody rain.</p>
        <p>We don't have many third-world real estate fantasies. I hate to think we could be so shallow, but it may be that our ability to have a good fantasy is linked to the life expectancy and gross national product of the country involved. We once went on a ''trek'' in the Himalayas. I passed scores of women who were also trekking, but they were doing it all day every day, up and down the mountain carrying plastic buckets of water on their heads.</p>
        <p>The Nepalese fantasy outlook was a little more promising for Larry. The men spent their days sitting cross-legged, playing cards, smoking and growing stubble. Sure, I yearned to breathe that pure mountain air on a permanent basis, and to see day break gloriously each morning over Mount Everest -- but not with a bucket on my head.</p>
        <p>Paris is our favorite place in which to pretend to live. We've almost bought real estate there several times. We don't care if the French aren't friendly. When we are French, we won't be friendly either.</p>
        <p>I love to imagine who I'd be if I were French. I walk the streets, giving the women the once-over, especially the femmes d'un certain age, my age, middle age, to be precise. Would I dare to slip into the skin of that flamboyantly hennaed woman carrying the baguette, the one with the cheekbones, the purple frock and the green kid heels that do not hurt her feet? I imagine her on her way to the open-air market where she will buy an armload of flowers and, on a whim, a canary in a cage. (I don't like birds and have never wished to own one, but in Paris I will.)</p>
        <p>Larry the lawyer thinks he's that insouciant guy over there, leaning against the archway rolling a Gauloise around between his lips, letting the ash fall. Larry's fantasy involves frequent visits to the Louvre, reading in the Tuileries, eating sweetbreads and, in the summers, sailing off the coast of Normandy. (Larry doesn't sail and we have lived for 30 years on Long Island Sound.)</p>
        <p>After a few days of imagining ourselves French, we find we are speaking French. That is to say, we are speaking our very own spontaneous patois -- using French words when we can remember them, and when we can't, speaking English with a French accent, like Charles Boyer. But of course. We eat a lot of sandwichs jambon. We return to the same cafe at dusk. We discuss which of our favorite reds should be our house wine. Thus Frenchified, we feel that the time is right to find our fantasy home.</p>
        <p>Invariably, on one of our many delightfully aimless walks, we find ourselves in front of a real estate office. We examine the photographs on display in the window. Do we want a house or an apartment? Should we louer or acheter? The Left Bank, of course, but quelle arrondissement?</p>
        <p>Larry, whose favorite opera is ''La Boheme,'' would like something in the way of a garret, with a dormer window and chimney pots. And a sink in the corner. I'm not fussy, as long as there's a place for my canary.</p>
        <p>But can we afford it? Larry converts the various asking prices from francs into dollars. These conversions are followed by a pause, which is long and weighty enough to indicate that we are giving sober consideration to the matter. Then he speaks the words that let me know we've got a full-fledged fantasy on our hands: ''I wonder how much we could get for our house?'' We've got lift-off. It is embarrassing to think about the trail of aborted rental and purchase agreements we have left in our wake. In St.-Remy it was ''Small house in town with irises and cyprus trees''; in Katmandu ''Renovated monastery cell''; in Jackson Hole ''Log cabin, Teton backdrop''; in the Cotswolds ''One-bedroom cottage, thatched.''</p>
        <p>How easily we betray our real lives in our dreams! How heedless of the time and energy we put into home, community and friends, never mind love of country. Vacation fantasizing is a lot like a midlife crisis. You want to dump your old life and marry some place new.</p>
        <p>We are not the innocent, faithful children we once were. We don't call out a fond, ''Goodbye house, goodbye door, goodbye steps, goodbye lawn'' as we back down the driveway. Instead, it's ''Lemme outa here'' as we make our escape, pursued by a swarm of stress: Did I change the message on the answering machine? Do I have my passport? Did I hold the mail, pay the bills, call off the newspaper, program the VCR, turn down the thermostat, straighten my sock drawer, review my will, forget the tickets, remember the Xanax? Who wouldn't want to live somewhere else?</p>
        <p>Most of the time we're pretty good at keeping fantasy in its place. Of course we're not going to live in a garret in Paris. We're just playing house. We've learned our lesson the hard way. Whenever we have tried to mix fantasy with reality, the gods have exacted their price. It can be paid in either cash or humiliation.</p>
        <p>After a particularly pleasant vacation in London a few years ago, we resisted the temptation to buy a flat and settled for buying a London cab. At the time, cabs that had been retired from service were sold at a garage near Elephant and Castle. Ours had over 300,000 miles on it. It had a running board. It was full of quaint advertisements. The seat flipped down. The meter worked. We imagined what fun we'd have picking up our friends for dinner and the movies.</p>
        <p>Once home, we waited eagerly for the word from Hoboken that our taxi had arrived. When Larry claimed it at the dock, he and three guys with tattoos had to push it to get it started. Then the wheels fell off. The customs inspector felt so sorry for Larry he refused to charge him any duty.</p>
        <p>On yet another occasion we trespassed the threshold between fantasy and reality big time. It was the 70's, and we were young and idealistic. We moved from Connecticut to Big Sur, Calif., on the strength of a two-week stay at the Esalen Institute, where I was convinced that I could actualize my human potential by pounding on a pillow and hugging strangers.</p>
        <p>It's not as if our friends didn't try to warn us. One of them did his best to stop us but we stubbornly refused to get the point.</p>
        <p>''Haven't you ever had a fantasy about living a better life in another place?'' I challenged him.</p>
        <p>''Of course I have. I even have a favorite fantasy. I want to move to London and hire out as a butler in a well-appointed home.''</p>
        <p>''Well then why don't you do it?'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Because then I wouldn't have it as a fantasy any more.''</p>
        <p>For an entire year I was a California mountain woman. I earnestly eschewed brassieres in favor of black leotards. I wore long paisley skirts that could double as tablecloths, tied at the waist. I grew all my hair. I made my own granola. I said ''far out.'' But no matter what I did or how hard I pounded, I was still from the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Larry, who is better than I am at making the best of a bad deal, smoked a lot and volunteered as a model for the massage class. When we finally got home and slipped back into reality we vowed we'd never, ever again lose our grip on fantasy.</p>
