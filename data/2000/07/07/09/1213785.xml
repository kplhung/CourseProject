        <p>A Future Perfect</p>
        <p>The Essentials of Globalization.</p>
        <p>By John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge.</p>
        <p>386 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>Will globalization succeed? This is the question that John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge tackle in ''A Future Perfect,'' the most recent addition to the growing literature on the global economy. The authors, both journalists with The Economist, are straightforward about their sympathies. They are classic liberals who favor free trade and the unrestricted mobility of capital. While acknowledging that some people and nations are not faring well in global competition, they believe that the winners far outnumber the losers. Globalization, in their view, is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. They fear, however, that globalization's success is threatened, not so much by the protests of protectionists or anarchists as by the timidity of its defenders.</p>
        <p>The triumph of market economics and the spread of democratic governance in the aftermath of the cold war are certainly causes for optimism. But is it too early to celebrate? The last time that globalization occurred, in the latter half of the 19th century, it ended badly in world war and depression. Nothing could be more important than figuring out how to make the current globalization a winning and sustainable proposition.</p>
        <p>Micklethwait and Wooldridge are hardly the first writers to weigh in on globalization. There have already been shrewd journalistic efforts by, among others, Thomas L. Friedman, William Greider and Robert D. Kaplan. Economists like Lester C. Thurow, Dani Rodrik and Barry Eichengreen have written substantial books on the subject, while businessmen like George Soros and Bill Gates have offered their own assessments of our economic future. But Micklethwait and Wooldridge are unusually comprehensive in their analysis, which touches on everything from the reform of the International Monetary Fund to the proper role of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, their book has a disjointed and rehashed feel. Their description of companies and regions affected by the global economy adds little to Friedman's and Greider's reporting. A section on the six principles of global management reads like a list from a pop-culture management guru, and their advice to individuals on how to invest in the global economy seems out of place in a work of political economy.</p>
        <p>The most disappointing part of the book is its discussion of politics in the age of globalization. ''Far from creating a need for a new sort of foreign policy,'' the authors write, ''globalization has not changed the fundamental rules and aims of diplomacy.'' They barely address the argument that global economic integration might radically transform international politics by altering military aims and raising the cost of military conflict. Is it necessary to take territory by force when countries can expand through trade and investment? Hasn't the economic integration of the European Union virtually ruled out war between Germany and France? Doesn't Nafta reduce the probability of conflict between Mexico and the United States?</p>
        <p>These are significant issues, and the authors fail to do them justice. They do not consider Greider's provocative thesis that overproduction and the imbalance of supply and demand might destabilize the global economy. Nor do they pay more than lip service to Kaplan's contention that failed states in Africa or the Balkans could undermine the global economy and the international political system.</p>
        <p>The authors have little good to say about current political leaders, dismissing Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Gerhard SchrRated PG-13der and Ehud Barak as no more than fainthearted advocates of globalization. They make little effort, however, to examine the Clinton administration's battles over Nafta and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and they severely underestimate the political skills that were required to win those two victories. Both these struggles are, in fact, important examples of the political challenges raised by globalization and the difficulties in winning public support for the global economy.</p>
        <p>Who, then, will save globalization from its enemies? ''The responsibility for making sure that globalization works,'' Micklethwait and Wooldridge write, ''lies principally with two groups of people: politicians and business people. Neither group seems an ideal steward. Politicians make a profession of appeasing vested interests; business people would rather think about making money than improving schools.'' Having made this discouraging observation, the authors offer only two role models from the last century's global expansion -- Sir Robert Peel, the British politician who championed free trade; and John D. Rockefeller, the Standard Oil robber-baron-turned-philanthropist. From their perspective, no one living can measure up to these great men, certainly not Bill Clinton or Tony Blair, and not even George Soros. Lamenting the shortage of Peels and Rockefellers, the authors end the book on an ambivalent note, with Marx's famous remark in the Communist Manifesto (''All that is solid melts into air'') about the socially disruptive nature of capitalism.</p>
        <p>While outlining the benefits of globalization and the political backlash it has provoked, Micklethwait and Wooldridge offer few insights on how to make such growth sustainable and stable, or on how the United States and Europe might more effectively lead the global system without leaving anyone behind. Perhaps it is because they overlook the essential relationship between democracy and capitalism. They have scant patience with the messiness of the democratic process, which requires taking into account the needs and fears of ordinary citizens. But globalization will succeed only if it has the consent of the governed, which means that democracy as well as capitalism must spread across the globe.</p>
        <p>Economic growth is the easy part of the equation. Laying the foundations for democratic politics is more difficult, particularly given the stark disparities in wealth and development that mark the global economy. Flawed but farsighted politicians like Clinton and Blair and entrepreneurs like Soros and Ted Turner understand that capitalism and democracy are inseparable and that binding them is crucial if globalization is to succeed. Sadly, the authors failed to explore the difficulties and opportunities of this essential task.</p>
