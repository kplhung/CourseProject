        <p>Rhododendrons require good drainage: their shallow roots may suffocate in waterlogged soil, and in heat they're susceptible to Phytophthora wilt, an overall wilting that begins with new growth. If drainage is improved, the plant may fight this fungal disease. If it succumbs, remove and destroy it, and do not plant another rhododendron (or azalea) in the same spot.</p>
        <p>Horticultural oil is now recommended for treatment of powdery mildew -- as well as for control of soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites. At the first sign of infection, begin spraying plants weekly.</p>
