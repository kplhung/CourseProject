        <p>IF technology remains the obsession of American investors, where are money managers placing their bets now? The answers can have all the longevity of a cast member on ''Survivor.'' To trace the path of  new-economy investing, fast feet and a good line of technospeak are required.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, there were B2C (business-to-consumer) stocks. Remember when theglobe.com, the Gen X Web portal, shot up  606 percent the day it went public? Love of all things B2C evaporated around the time that Barron's labeled Amazon.com as ''Amazon.bomb.'' Nowadays a share of theglobe is as cheap as a bottle of Snapple and Amazon.com is near its 52-week low.</p>
        <p>B2C gave way to B2B (business-to-business) until B2B valuations started to look as inflated as B2C's. Then came I.S.P.'s (Internet service providers) and A.S.P.'s (application service providers), software makers, networking companies and incubators -- companies that invest in all of the above. And then there was the hype surrounding Linux, the free operating system that would, we were told, gut Microsoft faster than the Justice Department could.</p>
        <p>Ah, for the good old days. Chastened by the technology correction, money managers now look a whole lot less favorably on companies with a future full of projected losses. Infrastructure plays -- companies that build the tangible devices that power the Internet, and actually make money -- are more sought after today.</p>
        <p>Not that there is no appetite for speculation, especially when the word ''wireless'' is mentioned. The next big thing, the buzz has it, will be wireless Internet -- Web-enabled cell phones, Dick Tracy watches, gadgets in the car. Two new technology mutual funds  focus exclusively on all things unplugged.</p>
        <p>Ryan Jacob, manager of the $150 million Jacob Internet fund, likes two companies that make software for wireless devices, Aether Systems of Owings Mills, Md., and 724 Solutions of Toronto. ''They're on the forefront of the next evolution we're going to see in Internet usage, which is bringing the Internet off the desktop,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But for Andrew S. Cupps, manager of the Strong Enterprise fund, the recent attention on wireless-related stocks makes it difficult to find reasonably priced stocks. ''We've had a little trouble identifying a stock where the valuation makes sense,'' he said. ''An Aether, a $7 billion valuation with massive losses and very little revenue? I'm going to have to plead ignorance.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he picked up National Semiconductor in the second quarter, a veteran chip maker that now supplies components for  cell phones and other wireless devices.</p>
        <p>''We've shifted to lower multiples and profitable companies,'' as opposed to those that promise more than they can deliver,  Mr. Cupps said. ''National Semiconductor is the best example, a very profitable company that's trading at a multiple below 20,''  referring to the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of about 17, less than two-thirds the average for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
        <p>That preference for companies in the black is shared by Peter Anastos and Gerald T. Malone, managers of the Alliance Technology fund, which with $12.6 billion in assets is one of the largest general technology funds. Their portfolio is very light on Internet stocks and heavy on semiconductors. The strategy has yielded steady, but not top-flight, long-term returns, according to Morningstar Inc.; the fund held up better than most of its peers in the second quarter and was up 11.6 percent in the first half.</p>
        <p>The relatively traditional approach puts stocks like Cisco Systems, PMC Sierra and Nokia at the top of the portfolio. The fund has also added to its positions in companies that the managers believe are leading players in emerging areas, including Veritas, JDS Uniphase and BEA Systems. They did bite on one Internet stock, picking up Yahoo as it fell 27.7 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>''Internet advertising might not show the growth this year that people expected, and advertising is the underpinning of the business model'' at Yahoo, Mr. Anastos said. ''It's a legitimate but short-term concern'' for a company whose market share is still growing, he said.</p>
        <p>E-commerce is on many managers' don't-like lists. Struggles in the sector began even before the April technology stock slump, and when other Internet stocks rebounded in June, e-commerce kept heading south. TheStreet.com E-Commerce index was off 59 percent for the first half.</p>
        <p>Flying against this downdraft, Firsthand Funds has just opened an e-commerce fund, Firsthand e-Commerce. Tellingly, it owns none of the usual e-commerce suspects: no Amazon.com, no Priceline.com, no eBay.</p>
        <p>''It's not that we have a 'sell' call on these stocks,'' said Kevin Landis, who manages the fund. ''We've just always avoided the group. Those companies are already famous, and those stocks are already expensive.''</p>
        <p>So what is the alternative? Infrastructure. Mr. Landis said that while the fund is not interested in retail dot-coms, ''we want to invest in everyone they pay'' -- the Internet software makers, the networking companies, the service providers.</p>
        <p>Among his favorites are companies that are hired to run Web sites and other computer operations for other companies. Mr. Landis added to a favorite position, Globix,  based in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, as it was falling 23.1 percent in the second quarter after a run-up of 1,100 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Landis also ''took a big chunk'' of the initial public offering of Genuity, which was spun off from GTE late last month.</p>
        <p>''The market's correction has given us an opportunity to buy stocks that would normally be too expensive for us,'' he said. ''High-growth, well-regarded, gold-plated tech companies -- you buy because this is the only time they are going to be cheap. You're less likely to go fishing for turnarounds.''</p>
