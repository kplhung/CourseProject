        <p>Correction of chart accompanying June 18 article about Harvard Business School (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A chart on June 18 with an article about changes at the Harvard Business School improperly compared one aspect of the school's admissions with a different aspect of admissions at the Stanford Business School. For Stanford, the chart showed the percentage of applicants who were accepted; for Harvard, it showed the percentage of applicants who were accepted and then actually enrolled. A corrected version, showing the acceptance rates for both schools, appears today on Page 9.</p>
