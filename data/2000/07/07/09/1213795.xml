        <p>BEAUTIFUL WASPS HAVING SEX</p>
        <p>By Dori Carter.</p>
        <p>Morrow, $24.</p>
        <p>If there were an award for attention-getting titles, ''Beautiful WASPs Having Sex,'' with its picture of an elderly turn-of-the-century Jewish couple on the jacket, would probably win hands down. But the story itself, which is meant to be one of those wicked satires of Hollywood but is in fact more about being Jewish in Hollywood, is a bit puzzling. Dori Carter is a former screenwriter who is married to Chris Carter, the creator of ''The X-Files,'' and her first novel is about 40-year-old Frankie Jordan, a newly divorced and none too successful screenwriter. The book's central conflict is between Frankie and her eventual nemesis, a 24-year-old aspiring producer named Jonathan Prince. The primary story here is about Frankie's attempts to get her screenplays made and the treacherous agents and producers who thwart her. But Carter's larger thesis is that Hollywood is a kind of shtetl for the WASP-envying Jews who run the town, and in this book there's hardly a gentile in sight. Too many of the Jewish characters, although most of them are under 45, speak like Jackie Mason-esque cartoon Jews; they frequently use the kind of Yiddishisms you might expect from early vaudeville. ''Oy vay iz mir, she's cleaning again,'' says one character, a producer. ''We're all suffering from secondhand Windex. Will you put that away? The shvartzeh comes tomorrow. . . . She's a baleboosteh.'' Carter gives us a stunningly dreary portrait of Jews in Hollywood -- and she is even more scathing in her depiction of the families they left behind back east. Frankie confesses that she, like other Jewish characters in the book, married her gentile husband to escape from the ''handwringing heaviness of it all.'' To that, and to this book in general, even a gentile would say, oy vey.</p>
