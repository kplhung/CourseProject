        <p>IMAGINE sitting home in Westchester, watching your favorite band perform a club date in Washington on your computer. Or, if you missed the live performance, buying it on CD or DVD after sampling it on the Internet. Burn-One.com, a technology company in Purchase, aims to make this all as easy as booting up your computer.</p>
        <p>''We can record a live performance anywhere in the world just by flipping on a switch in our control room here in Purchase,'' said Matthew J. Beekman, president of Burn-One.com and co-founder of its parent company, LiveWire Media. ''And we do it for a fraction of what it costs a traditional recording company.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beekman's father. Peter D. Beekman, Burn-One's chief financial officer, explained the company's long-term goal. ''You could see Tom Jones in concert at Foxwoods or Caesar's Palace and buy a CD of the show on your way out,'' he said. ''In one and a half weeks, you receive a video. That's what we can do.''</p>
        <p>That's the possibility. For now Burn-One is equipped to record performances on studio-quality audio and video at the Black Cat Club, a spot for alternative music in Washington, and Marty's, a rock club in Port Chester.</p>
        <p>Matthew Beekman said his three-year-old company would soon be operational in the Elbo Room, a Chicago jazz club. ''We're negotiating with other clubs around the country,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What does Burn-One have that nobody else has? A technology called LiveAXIS, which records live events from any location in the world, from one centralized network operations studio. Unlike traditional means of recording, LiveAXIS doesn't require a crew.</p>
        <p>''There's one company, Riffage, which recently bought the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco to record shows, but it has a large camera crew and overhead,'' said Peter Beekman, who earned his bachelor's degree in physics from Boston College in 1996. ''Once we've installed our cameras in the venue, we don't have to be there for the show. An engineer in our studio records it.</p>
        <p>''Every few months we go to the club to clean the smoke off the lenses,'' he added, ''but that's it as far as maintenance goes.''</p>
        <p>Once an event is recorded, Burn-One distributes the recording in a variety of formats, including CD, VHS, DVD, Internet media and broadcast on its Web site (www.Burn-One.com). The top shows are  made available for Internet-based listening via streaming technology from Liquid Audio and MP3.com. Web surfers can watch other  performances at www.burn-one.com through the Flash and Shockwave software plug-ins from Macromedia as well as via Windows Media Player.</p>
        <p>Peter Beekman said that besides music, his company would like to wire markets like sports, education, corporate business, syndicated broadcast media and other areas of entertainment like comedy, theater and fashion.</p>
        <p>Matthew Beekman and his brother Chris (who left the day-to-day operations of the company but remains on its board of directors) came up with the idea for Burn-One when they both worked for Westchester-based OnLine Voice, Video and Data, a global provider of communications technology and network services. 'Teleconferencing was such a big market, we thought there was just as great a need for similar technology in music,'' said Matthew Beekman, who built the OnLineFusion Electronic Commerce Engine, which fuels Burn-One's music store.</p>
        <p>One look at the company's growing roster of bands indicates that fledgling talent is eager to sign up with Burn-One. The company carries performances from more than two dozen groups, mostly from Westchester and Fairfield Counties. ''We first sign an agreement with the club, then if one of its bands want us to record them, we sign them to an agreement,'' said Matthew Beekman, adding that both the club and the band receives a royalty from any sales. ''Bands like it because they get an instant CD without having to lay out thousands of dollars.''</p>
        <p>The Beekmans have been negotiating with SFX, an entertainment group that  presents live music and theater throughout its 1,000-plus venues in the hopes of getting their company's equipment in its doors. Matthew Beekman said that he and his father were also trying to work with VH1, MTV and major recording labels.</p>
        <p>Peter Beekman, who was president of ICON Capital Corporation, an organization that amassed more than $500 billion in managing assets by the time he sold the company four years ago, is busy trying to accumulate capital investors to help Burn-One achieve this growth. So far the Beekmans' LiveWire Media company has pumped nearly $2 million into Burn-One. He has also begun a national marketing campaign aimed at licensing LiveAXIS technology to organizations. Based on the installation and communications requirements as well as the complexity of the proposed operations, the standard LiveAXIS system can be licensed for $7,500 to $35,000 a month.</p>
        <p>''The hardest part has been getting people to believe in us and our product,'' Peter Beekman said. ''It's difficult because it's so new. One decision I made was to have some product in place before so people didn't think we were selling vaporware. It's taking time, but I think we've established credibility.''</p>
        <p>Matthew Beekman agreed: ''Before, people didn't know what we were talking about. Once they see a show, they see it's for real.''</p>
