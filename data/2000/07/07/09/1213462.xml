        <p>Q What are the benefits and drawbacks of having a ''sit-down'' contract of sale when purchasing real estate? . . . George M. Colt, the Bronx.</p>
        <p>A Peter Schwartz, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that in most residential real estate transactions, the contract of sale is the product of negotiations conducted between the lawyers for the parties rather than the parties themselves. In most cases, Mr. Schwartz said, after the buyer and seller agree on a price, the seller's lawyer draws up the contract and sends it to the buyer's lawyer.</p>
        <p>The buyer's lawyer makes whatever changes he thinks necessary, allows the client to sign it, and then sends the amended contract back to the seller's lawyer for signing by the seller -- if the seller agrees to the amendments. In some cases, Mr. Schwartz said, the contract can be amended several times before its terms have been agreed to by all.</p>
        <p>With a so-called sit-down contract, Mr. Schwartz said, the negotiations are conducted in one place, at one time and with all the parties and their lawyers present.</p>
        <p>''Sit-downs usually happen when there are anxious parties on both sides who don't want to wait for their attorneys to draft the contract,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The most obvious benefit of a sit-down negotiation, Mr. Schwartz said, is that the parties end up with a binding contract in the least amount of time.</p>
        <p>''That's especially good for purchasers these days because in a seller's market, it makes sense for the buyer to lock the seller into the deal as quickly as possible,'' he said. At the same time, Mr. Schwartz said, the primary disadvantage of a sit-down contract is that it costs more.</p>
        <p>''Usually, both lawyers will charge more because instead of doing the negotiations in the comfort of their office, one or both will have to go out to a meeting and then sit there while the parties try to hammer out a deal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz said that while a sit-down contract may be useful for the purchase of a house -- because most such contracts contain clauses allowing the buyer to cancel the deal if defects are revealed by a home inspection -- the same may not be said for purchases of an apartment.</p>
        <p>''When you're buying an apartment, you always want your lawyer to conduct a due-diligence before you sign,'' he said, referring to the examination of books and records that lawyers conduct to ensure that a co-op corporation or condominium association is financially sound.</p>
        <p>Dealing With A Judgment Lien</p>
        <p>Q At a real estate closing, what is the normal way for the parties to deal with a judgment lien on the property? . . . Donna Raft, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A ''The normal way to deal with a judgment lien at a closing is to pay it,'' said John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hall explained that a judgment lien is a legal filing that gives a creditor an interest in real estate owned by a debtor. And while such a lien is not filed against a specific piece of property, he said, the filing of such a lien typically makes it impossible for the debtor to sell a property in the county where the lien was filed until the lien is paid.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Hall said, if the title search reveals an outstanding lien against the seller, the seller's lawyer will contact the person who filed the lien to determine the amount necessary to pay it -- an amount that often includes interest that has accrued since the judgment was obtained.</p>
        <p>If the figure is determined before the closing, he said, the lawyer for the buyer will satisfy it out of the proceeds of the sale that are due to the seller.</p>
        <p>If the payoff amount of the lien is not known on the day of closing, Mr. Hall said, the title company for the buyer will generally require the buyer's lawyer to hold twice the amount of the original lien in escrow until the exact payoff amount is determined and the lien is paid in full and removed from official records.</p>
