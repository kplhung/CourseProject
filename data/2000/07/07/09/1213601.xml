        <p>An unwanted immigrant has landed on the Lower East Side. After sneaking into Brooklyn in cargo from China in 1996, a tree-killing beetle has now crossed the Williamsburg Bridge and buried itself inside the neighborhood's hardwoods.</p>
        <p>Last month, the city Parks Department discovered the Asian longhorned beetle, considered the top threat to the city's trees, inside 19 Norway maples under the bridge overpass. The department quickly cut down the infested trees, in the Luther Gulick playground, at Delancey and Willet Streets.</p>
        <p>Some residents were so saddened by the loss that they tried, unsuccessfully, to stop the tree removal before it was completed. ''A park without trees is like a day without sunshine,'' said Martin Cohen, who lives nearby, on Grand Street. ''You're not cutting down trees. You're cutting down a park.''</p>
        <p>The parasitic beetles kill trees by drilling dime-size holes deep into the trunks, where they lay larvae that eat away the tree from the inside. While injectable pesticides are being tested, the only proven method for exterminating the larvae is to uproot, pulverize and burn the tree.</p>
        <p>''It's terrible,'' said Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner. ''But this is the only way to make sure the beetles are dead.'' To date, the city has removed  2,600 infested trees and planted nearly 3,300 ''non-host'' varieties such as oaks. Mr. Stern hopes to plant replacement trees on the Lower East Side this fall.</p>
        <p>The Chinese beetles are believed to have arrived inside the wood in crates and pallets. They first appeared in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, in 1996; subsequent infestations were found in several spots in Queens. They remained on that side of the East River until last August, when some were found on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Besides the New York area, the pests have been discovered in suburbs around  Chicago, said Enrique Figueroa, a deputy undersecretary of the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>New York City officials, who will spend $10 million to battle the bug this year, expect to find more infestations in the coming weeks as the larvae mature. Tree inspectors typically look for suspicious holes or fresh piles of sawdust and insect waste near the base. The public can report sightings of the beetles, inch-long insects that have black shells with white spots, and long antennas, by calling (800) 201-PARK.</p>
        <p>''This is not just a local city issue,'' Mr. Stern said. ''These predatory creatures pose a danger to the forest of the entire Northeast.''</p>
