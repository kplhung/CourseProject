        <p>The colorful beads and butterfly hair clips that marked the teenage style of Venus Williams were gone. From the moment she strode onto Center Court today, the streamlined 20-year-old with the Paul Bunyan backswing had the look of a serious young woman. A scowl was as good as any accessory.</p>
        <p>Only at the last moment, as a forehand volley slipped off Lindsay Davenport's racket, did Williams release her furrowed brow and let pure joy take over. Suddenly, she was leaping across the lawn of Center Court like a child twirling through a backyard sprinkler.</p>
        <p>She could not contain herself. She had to share the moment. So Williams bounded up the stairs that led to the edge of the friends box, embraced her little sister Serena and slapped hands with her clairvoyant father, who was doing a soft-shoe on top of a broadcast booth. Just as Richard Williams had predicted a day before, his daughter Venus won today with her 6-3, 7-6 (3) finals victory at the All England Club.</p>
        <p>Finally, Althea Gibson was not alone anymore. Williams became the first African-American woman to win Wimbledon since Gibson grabbed the title in 1958. And at the same time, Venus and Serena Williams became the first sisters in tennis history to each own a Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>''This was meant to be,'' Venus Williams said. ''I worked real hard all my life. I had a lot of sacrifices.''</p>
        <p>There were the endless days on the courts of Compton, Calif., whacking through a shopping cart filled with 550 balls. But with sensitivity to those who traveled a far more arduous journey, Williams had perspective on what she had achieved next to Gibson.</p>
        <p>''It had to be hard because people were unable to see past color,'' Williams said. ''Still, these days, it's hardly any different because you realize it's been only 40 years. How can you change years and centuries of being biased in 40 years?''</p>
        <p>But in just a handful of years, the Williams sisters have stirred up the tennis scene. Side by side, Venus and Serena have opened eyes with their colorful style, charismatic personalities and foot-to-the-pedal power. Now, there is no separating the sisters' resume. The big sister has caught up to the little one. Less than a year ago, Venus Williams sat stoically in her seat as Serena won the United States Open.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't help but feel sorry for her last fall when Serena won first,'' Davenport said. ''You knew eventually she was going to win a Grand Slam. I mean, who knew when it was going to be. It seemed like the press was always getting on her case, 'When are you going to do it?' It's nice to see the monkey get off her back. Both Serena and Venus are going to win more Grand Slams.''</p>
        <p>Until this week, there was a sense that Serena was the better of the two, that the lanky Venus would never challenge her compact sibling. Whatever faults are more visible in Venus Williams's game than in her little sister's, she made up for them this fortnight with unflappable calm and unrestrained shot-making. Without hesitation, Venus Williams won a rousing three-set show of force against the top-seeded Martina Hingis, and then focused through the emotion of beating her eighth-seeded little sister. Would she be too drained to face the second-seeded Davenport?</p>
        <p>After a 20-minute delay because of a light drizzle, the question was answered instantly. While inside the locker room, Venus Williams must have been applying a hard stare. Instead of being giddy at the occasion, she had the mental focus to shatter mirrors as she stepped on the court and dominated.</p>
        <p>''No matter what I had to do, I was going to go for it,'' Williams said. ''I went ahead and hit my big serve. On my ground strokes, I didn't start waiting for someone to miss. I just went for it whether I missed or not.''</p>
        <p>Coiling her 6-foot-1-inch frame, Williams furiously unwound on every ground stroke, going for every line, looking for any opening. She was unrelenting. Even when the powerful 6-2 Davenport sent her on the run, Williams was able to unfold her long wingspan and turn sure winners into saves.</p>
        <p>The trend exasperated Davenport. She mumbled to herself, tossed her head back in frustration and had no answer for Williams in a runaway first set. During the second set, Davenport began serving better, pinning Williams back just a bit, but she could not come up with big points on cue.</p>
        <p>There was only one brief shaft of light for Davenport, the defending champion. Serving for the match, an overeager Williams rushed through her motions, hit two double faults and allowed Davenport to break her serve and even the second set, 5-5. But as the two held their serves and dashed into a tie breaker, Williams did not quiver. During a run of 5 points in a row, Williams hooked a forehand in for a winner and ended another tense rally with a swinging forehand volley that pummeled the grass.</p>
        <p>''It's tough when your opponent is hitting the ball so hard and on the lines,'' said Davenport, whose mobility was not at its best during the tournament because of a previous back injury. ''It was just really hard to combat the power that she was giving me and try to run down enough balls on the grass.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the grass court turned into a catwalk for Venus Williams. She had a dress she wanted to model here, and now she will get the chance. As an example of a confidence born of her father's positive reinforcement, just days before she and her sister departed for England, Venus Williams went to a mall in Florida and bought a gown for the Wimbledon champions ball.</p>
        <p>''I had one dress I could wear,'' Williams said. ''It was last year's, and colors have changed since then. I was scrambling. It was an extra incentive to win, because if I didn't, I wouldn't get to wear this wonderful dress.''</p>
        <p>Today, she had just the right look. She had tunnel vision even as her father created a stir nearby. While Richard Williams's unorthodox blueprint for his daughters' success has been proved to be a genius plan, sometimes he oversteps the lines of taste in some people's eyes. Throughout the match, Richard Williams held up signs with different slogans: ''Hello, Mrs. Williams, I miss and love you,'' and ''We love the Duke and Dutchess,'' and ''It's Venus' party, no one is invited.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't see them,'' Venus Williams said, referring to the signs. ''I was mostly looking at my notes.''</p>
        <p>During the changeovers, Venus Williams pulled out scraps of paper with different reminders on them: stay relaxed, stay focused, bend your knees. For an entire match, she was deep in serious thought.</p>
        <p>Only after match point did she allow the kid in her to escape. As she let out a delirious yell and leaped in the air, the Williams family stood up in a group cheer. With her hands over her mouth, Serena was shaking with emotion. Two days earlier, she was crestfallen to lose to her big sister. Today, as Venus bounded up to the friends box, she wrapped her arms around her big sister.</p>
        <p>''She just told me, 'Great job,' '' Venus Williams said. ''She was really, really getting emotional, trying to hold it in.''</p>
        <p>It was not a moment for restraint. Venus Williams celebrated the way she played the match: she held nothing back.</p>
        <p>As she stood on the court and held the champion's plate in her hands -- which is named the Venus Rosewater trophy -- she glowed as if she was the one polished.</p>
        <p>''It's better than the men's cup in my opinion,'' Venus Williams proclaimed.</p>
        <p>Spinning around for the cameras, Williams flashed a full-moon smile. A moment later, she was in front of a microphone on Center Court.</p>
        <p>''It's really great because I've been working so hard all my life to be here,'' Venus Williams said. ''It's strange. I'd go to bed at night and I'd dream I'd won a Grand Slam, but when I woke up, there was the nightmare. Now, I don't have to wake up like that anymore.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>TODD WOODBRIDGE and MARK WOODFORDE won their sixth Wimbledon doubles title yesterday, beating PAUL HAARHUIS and SANDON STOLLE, 6-3, 6-4, 6-1, in a repeat of the French Open final. The victory gave them their seventh title this year and the 60th of their career as a team, and left them just one short of tying the 12 Grand Slam doubles titles held by JOHN NEWCOMBE and TONY ROCHE.</p>
