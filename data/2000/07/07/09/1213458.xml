        <p>ON a cloudless Saturday in June, George Nikitovich stands shin-deep in the Cross River, surrounded by overhanging maple branches. As he strokes his fly rod back and forth in the air with a gentle whipping motion, his eyes are glued to the stream, where his fly -- a size 14 Caddis made of elk hair and rooster feather -- floats gently down the gin-clear water.</p>
        <p>''You have to know how to read the water, to find out where the trout will naturally hide,'' Mr. Nikitovich said.</p>
        <p>And watching the water alerts you to anything that may be wrong with it.</p>
        <p>Westchester County still has some of the best trout fishing in the state. Wild brown and brook trout swim in the rivers and reservoirs that supply New York City with its drinking water, luring scores of fishermen on summer days like this one.</p>
        <p>But a continuing development boom has threatened the city's watershed as never before. Since trout, more than most other fish species, require clean water to thrive, Mr. Nikitovich and other fishermen have become some of the region's most alert and aggressive environmental advocates.</p>
        <p>The fishermen are now leading a new offensive in the struggle to protect the watershed. Focusing on stormwater runoff, which the federal Environmental Protection Agency has called the greatest threat to drinking water across the country, members of the group Trout Unlimited have documented dozens of storm drains that are channeling polluted water into the area's reservoirs and streams. They are also planning to sue the owners of those storm drains, in concert with Riverkeeper, the environmental watchdog group based in Garrison .</p>
        <p>Mr. Nikitovich, 50, a somber-looking stock broker from Cross River, doesn't exactly fit the profile of a tree-hugging activist. ''I sometimes wonder -- why am I the one doing this?'' he said.</p>
        <p>The answer, he added, is that no one else is out in the streams all day. When there is a threat to the city's water, fishermen are usually the first to know about it.</p>
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the lead lawyer for Riverkeeper, agreed. ''You can talk to state biologists all day, but the people who really know what's going on in the watershed are the fishermen,'' he said. ''They have always been the mainstay of our evidence-gathering capacity and our clients.''</p>
        <p>Fishermen have played a role in the watershed since its creation. When the city began building a network of reservoirs for its water supply in the 19th century, it created the ideal environment for trout. Trout thrive in very cold water, and the bottom water from the reservoirs, feeding into the shallow tailwater streams below, is so cold that on summer days mist rises from it.</p>
        <p>In return, fishermen helped to police the city's waters and limit development in the forests that surrounded them.</p>
        <p>Theodore Gordon, William Harris and other founders of modern fly-fishing also helped start the conservationist movement in the Catskills at the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>In 1966 Robert Boyle founded the Hudson River Fishermen's Association, now known as Riverkeeper, one of the watershed's most aggressive legal advocates.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the water's purity was not in doubt. The city's daisy chain of upstate streams and reservoirs acted as a vast filter, cleansing the water as it flowed through forests and tributaries into the aqueducts that supply what a succession of mayors have called ''the champagne of city water.''</p>
        <p>But the city owns only 4 percent of the land that drains into the watershed, and some of the city officials charged with protecting the water supply had moonlighting jobs as consultants to developers. As Westchester and Putnam Counties grew in the 1960's, 70's and 80's, pollution seeped into the water from septic fields, sewage treatment plants, roads and lawns.</p>
        <p>As threats to the water mounted, fishermen became some of most active reporters of water violations, helping to fill the gaps in the city's understaffed police unit.</p>
        <p>''They've had a real impact,'' said Tony Bonavist, an Ossining native who worked for the state's Fisheries Department for 26 years until he retired in 1992. ''We didn't have people in the field. If there was a problem in the streams, I'd get a call.''</p>
        <p>One of the most serious concerns for trout fishermen has been the more than 100 sewage treatment plants in the watershed. In October, John Keane and several other members of Trout Unlimited tested the water in Hallock's Mill Brook, a trout stream that receives wastewater from the largest of the plants, in Yorktown. They used methods they had been taught by the state's Stream Biomonitoring Unit in Troy. Above the plant, 75 percent of the aquatic insects they found were Caddis flies -- an indicator of high water quality. Below the outlet, the figure was 5 percent.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Bonavist went to the stream in hopes of catching trout. Instead, he saw foaming bubbles floating on it, not far from the sewage plant outlet.</p>
        <p>Ronald Pierce, a senior aquatic biologist for the state, said an official had tested the water in the stream in response to Mr. Bonavist's complaint and had not found any evidence of serious pollution. But the Yorktown plant has chronically violated its permit in years past, and let raw sewage overflow at least four times in 1999, said James Tierney, the inspector general for the city's watershed.</p>
        <p>City and county authorities are now looking into ways to pipe the Yorktown plant's waste to a site out of the watershed.</p>
        <p>But it is impossible to remove the largest threat to the city's water, which comes from the countless miscellaneous pollutants that collect on roads and fields and flow into rivers and reservoirs. This kind of pollution tends to grow in direct proportion to the amount of paved surface in a given area, as the land's natural ability to filter out pollutants is diminished.</p>
        <p>Such diffuse or ''nonpoint'' pollution is hard to measure or police, because its sources are so various. The federal government has only begun to regulate it, and states and counties tend to follow the federal lead.</p>
        <p>For fishermen, however, it is often impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>When a storm drain from a housing development in the town of Carmel began shooting muddy water onto the west branch of the Croton River seven years ago, Mr. Nikitovich noticed immediately. The West Branch is one of the most beautiful streams in the watershed. Every fall, brown trout as large as 10 pounds swim up the river to spawn from the Croton Falls reservoir.</p>
        <p>The storm drain was a threat to those spawning grounds because newborn trout live in streambeds, and when they become silted up the trout cannot survive.</p>
        <p>Soon afterward, John Keane and other Trout Unlimited members became involved. They realized that the silt pouring into the river wasn't just a threat to trout. Silt or mud -- turbidity is the the technical term -- is a serious threat to drinking water, because the mud can carry with it bacteria, heavy metals and other dangerous pollutants.</p>
        <p>Already, 10 of the city's 19 reservoirs are overloaded with phosphorus, an unwanted nutrient carried in runoff, which can cause algae blooms and elevate toxic elements in the water.</p>
        <p>Other potential pollutants could be deadly. In 1993, an intestinal parasite called  cryptosporidium, which is carried in animal and human waste, entered Milwaukee's water supply, killing more than 100 people and making 400,000 ill.</p>
        <p>Even if pollution never causes similar disasters in New York, it could cost the city a considerable amount of money. Because of pollution in the Croton watershed, the city has already committed itself to building a $1 billion filtration plant for the 10 percent of its water that comes from east of the Hudson. If the pollution gets worse, the federal government has made clear that the city will have to build what would be the world's largest filtration plant for the 90 percent of the water that comes from the Catskills and the Delaware River Valley. The plant would cost at least $6 billion to build and more than $300 million a year to operate, sending city  water and sewer rates up even more than the annual rise of 7 to 9 percent in recent years.</p>
        <p>To avoid these costs, the city reached an agreement in 1997 with the federal, state and local governments and environmental groups to spend $1 billion over 10 years on watershed protection. That agreement includes a commitment to buy more land as a buffer against development, as well as modernizing septic fields and sewage-treatment plants and carrying out new rules and restrictions on development.</p>
        <p>But there are gaps in the current laws, and fishermen have been among the most active in pointing them out.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Nikitovich and other trout fishermen have led a campaign to bolster the laws protecting watershed streams. All reservoirs in the watershed are rated AA -- the highest class of protection -- but many of the streams that flow into them are rated C or D, a rating that could allow developers to reroute them with a backhoe. Under federal law, the state is supposed to review streams for possible reclassification every three years. But that has not happened in the watershed for 25 years.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the state, said reclassification was a complicated and expensive process, and other states had also taken decades to complete it. She also said hearings on the watershed's streams are expected to begin before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Fishermen have also been among the most vocal opponents of new development projects in the watershed, like the current proposal to broaden Route 120, which runs along the Kensico Reservoir.</p>
        <p>Above all, the fishermen have focused on finding effective ways to combat stormwater runoff, which has the most direct impact on trout streams.</p>
        <p>One of the most effective methods, they say, can be seen on the west branch of the Croton River, where runoff from a pipe once threatened the brown trout's spawning grounds.</p>
        <p>Today, that runoff flows into a shallow bog known as a detention basin, about 180 feet long and 75 feet wide, which the town of Carmel built last year. The water accumulates in the basin, where the sediment slowly settles out, and plants on the bottom help to filter out toxic elements. At the basin's far end is a stone weir, which regulates a slow flow of water through a pipe and into a stone culvert, where it trickles gently and  harmlessly into the stream.</p>
        <p>That detention basin is a model for controlling stormwater runoff, Mr. Keane said. But it took years of complaints and letter writing by Trout Unlimited before city officials finally visited the site and forced the town to build the basin.</p>
        <p>Although the city tried to combat the problem by mandating stormwater controls for all new development in 1997, it has done little to fix runoff problems caused by buildings constructed before that time.</p>
        <p>Last year Mr. Keane organized a team to document other runoff problems throughout the portion of the watershed east of the Hudson River. They photographed each site from several angles. They took samples of the water before and after rain. They did toxicological tests. In a third of the sites, they found toxic elements in the water.</p>
        <p>Their final report, to be released this week, includes a novel legal threat. Instead of giving way to the conventional wisdom that runoff is everybody's and nobody's fault, the report claims that storm drains are ''point sources'' of pollution and their owners can therefore be sued under the Clean Water Act. Already, Mr. Kennedy has announced that Riverkeeper plans to sue the owner of every storm drain listed in the report.</p>
        <p>It is an unusual strategy, and it is too early to tell whether it will work. Some of the storm drains are owned by the state, some by the city, some by the towns, some by private individuals, and it is not always clear who is responsible for the pollution that flows through them.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: Mr. Keane and his fellow fishermen have made clear that trout play a role in safeguarding the city's water supply.</p>
        <p>''Our attitude is that trout are like canaries in the mine,'' Mr. Keane said. ''If trout can't live in the water, you've got to be concerned.''</p>
