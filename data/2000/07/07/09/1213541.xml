        <p>THERE were swoons and rebounds, and then more again of the same. But by the end of the second quarter, the stock market had provided enough bad news to push every major category of United States diversified equity funds into negative territory for the period.  Over all, domestic diversified stock funds lost 3.1 percent.</p>
        <p>What funds managed to shine as stormy weather lashed the markets? Generally, the winners owned shares in companies in old-economy sectors, like oil and gas, as well as in health care and some financial services.</p>
        <p>Managers of three top-performing funds talked about the resurgence of once-beaten-down sectors and what they expect from the stock market during the remainder of the year.</p>
        <p>Helped by a U-Turn</p>
        <p>Cheap, small stocks propelled the $262.7 million Ariel fund into second place among funds for the quarter, with a return of 14 percent.</p>
        <p>''Our stocks were so extraordinarily cheap at the beginning of the quarter that they were really poised to move up sharply,'' said its manager, John W. Rogers Jr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers, 42, looks for companies that sell for a discount of at least 40 percent to their private market value (what they would be worth to an acquirer), and whose shares trade at less than 14 times projected earnings for the next year. The fund holds just 35 issues.</p>
        <p>One big winner was Central Newspapers of Phoenix, owner of The Arizona Republic, The Indianapolis Star and other papers. ''Newspapers are cheap because investors are worrying about the impact of the Internet,'' Mr. Rogers said, ''and publishers worry about rising paper prices.''</p>
        <p>The company's share price was so depressed, he added, that management put the business up for sale. Last month, Gannett agreed to buy it for $2.6 billion; the stock rose 89 percent for the quarter.</p>
        <p>Another holding, Hussmann International of St. Louis, agreed to be acquired during the quarter by Ingersoll-Rand for a premium of more than 100 percent, Mr. Rogers said.  The company makes refrigeration equipment for supermarkets.</p>
        <p>''It's an industry that no one cared about earlier in the year, when people were enamored of dot-com companies,'' he said. ''And it missed a few quarters' earnings, which gave people an excuse to neglect it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers also made money on Littelfuse, the fund's only technology stock. The company, based in Des Plaines, Ill., is a leading provider of miniature electrical fuses for the automobile industry; it recently began making fuses for cell phones,  personal digital assistants and other electronic devices. The stock rose 33.6 percent in the quarter, helped by improving earnings and the move into the new markets.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Mr. Rogers sees more gains for small- and mid-capitalization value stocks, even after their second-quarter sprint. ''So many boards of directors and C.E.O.'s are saying that the stock price of their company doesn't reflect the value of the business,'' he said, ''and they're taking steps to realize that value.''</p>
        <p>Energy and Health Care Bets</p>
        <p>Edward J. von der Linde took the No. 13 place for the quarter with his $456.4 million Lord Abbett Mid-Cap Value fund, with a gain of 8.4 percent. ''As the market broadens out and diversifies away from large-cap growth stocks,'' said Mr. von der Linde, 40, ''investors have gravitated to the types of stocks that we buy.''</p>
        <p>One big winner was EOG Resources in Houston, up 57.6 percent, helped by rising natural-gas prices. ''Investors are realizing that gas producers haven't been able to keep pace with demand,'' he said. Enron is more leveraged to natural-gas price increases, he said, than any other domestic gas company.</p>
        <p>He also made money in Caremark Rx, a Birmingham, Ala., company that organizes drug benefit programs for health insurers and H.M.O.'s. The stock rose 62.7 percent in the quarter. The drivers of its performance included the divestiture of its unprofitable physician practice management business and  the settlement of litigation involving a convertible bond issue. ''The company has annual revenue growth of 20 percent,'' Mr. von der Linde said, ''so once the clouds were gone, the stock price began to take off.''</p>
        <p>St. Jude Medical, a St. Paul maker of heart valves and pacemakers,  rose 77.8 percent. Investors began bidding up the price in anticipation of the Food and Drug Administration approval, expected by year-end, of a new, lightweight cardiac device, he  said. Moreover, a new chief executive, Terry Shepherd, who took over in 1999, has smoothed out the company's problems meeting earnings expectations. ''He is communicating with Wall Street and rebuilding the earnings numbers,'' he said, ''which is generating confidence in the company as it moves toward its new product introduction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. von der Linde is optimistic about the stock market. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see the rally in the old leaders continue for another few months,'' he said. ''Investors suddenly seem to be taking notice of earnings. The next logical step is that they'll pay attention to valuations, which will broaden out leadership in the marketplace.''</p>
        <p>Profiting From Credit Risk</p>
        <p>Buying companies with strong earnings growth while keeping a sharp eye on prices pushed the $200 million Wasatch Core Growth into the No. 7 place, up 10 percent. ''In the last three quarters, we've seen the strongest earnings growth in our portfolio companies that we've ever seen,'' said J. B. Taylor, 28, co-manager of the fund with Sam Stewart, 55.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor said the annual earnings growth of the companies in the fund has been nearly 30 percent, even though their trailing price-to-earnings multiples have been less than 20, which is relatively low. ''With high-tech investments in vogue,'' he said, ''a lot of great, solid companies are being passed over.''</p>
        <p>One of them, he said, is Rent-a-Center, in Plano, Tex., which rose 50 percent in the quarter. The company operates a ''rent-to-own'' business that leased electronics, appliances, furniture and other goods to consumers, including those without credit cards or checking accounts or with poor credit histories. Its earnings are growing at an annual rate of 25 percent, while shares trade at about 10 times its earnings for the previous 12 months.</p>
        <p>Another company that caters to people with poor credit is Americredit, a consumer finance company in Fort Worth whose stock rose 4.3 percent. Americredit's customers ''are good loan applicants now, because they've turned around or they're willing to pay premiums for their loans,'' Mr. Taylor said. Annual earnings growth exceeds 25 percent, and shares trade for about 13 times trailing 12-month earnings.</p>
        <p>He also likes Express Scripts of St. Louis, a drug benefits management organization. Its cash flow has been growing 20 percent a year, Mr. Taylor said, but its share price was depressed because of the general downturn in many health care stocks. It rose 47.9 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Mr. Taylor expects value stocks to dominate. ''I see an increasing focus -- or return to focus -- on fundamentals, because so many investors have been burned by hyped stocks,'' he said. ''In the last couple of months, Wall Street has been shifting its focus to earnings.''</p>
