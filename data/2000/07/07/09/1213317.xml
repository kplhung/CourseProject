        <p>Blind Eye:  The Terrifying Story of a Doctor Who Got Away With Murder  By James B. Stewart.  Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.</p>
        <p>A journalist tells the story of a doctor suspected of killing at least 35 hospital patients, and indicts the medical authorities who failed to protect the public. Last year our reviewer, Lance Morrow, called this a ''chillingly thorough and superbly matter-of-fact . . . reconstruction that has the fascination of an acutely observed and troubling novel.''</p>
        <p>Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice  By A. S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12.</p>
        <p>A British writer whose work explores the intersection of aesthetics and morality spins tales in which stolid, blinkered Europeans from the North become either imprisoned or re-energized by the earthier South and the warmer-blooded people (mostly artists) who live there. In Byatt's eyes, it is an unforgivable crime not to be curious about a world ''full of light and life.'' ''Byatt's prose is capacious yet exquisite,'' Fernanda Eberstadt wrote in the Book Review in 1999, and this collection is infused with ''the throwaway gleams of a writer at the height of her powers.''</p>
        <p>The Distance to the Moon:  A Road Trip Into the American Dream  By James Morgan. Riverhead, $12.95.</p>
        <p>The author explores America's obsessive love affair with cars and car culture as he drives from Miami to Portland, Ore., in a shiny new Porsche. ''The human case for the automobile has never been more persuasively presented,'' Bruce McCall wrote here last year. I'm a Stranger Here Myself: Notes on Returning to America After Twenty Years Away, by Bill Bryson (Broadway, $14), is a collection of humorous dispatches written for a British newspaper about the author's bumpy re-entry into his native culture with his English wife and four children. ''The best columns are those in which the author discards his hapless persona and allows his natural impatience and intelligence out of their cages,'' Elizabeth Gleick said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>True at First Light  By Ernest Hemingway.  Edited by Patrick Hemingway. Scribner, $13.</p>
        <p>This fictional chronicle of an African safari, which was abandoned by Hemingway and edited by one of his sons, is a pale imitation of the writer's best work, James Wood said here last year. Nonetheless, ''there is a kind of mottled glamour, made up of bullying integrity and nonsense, of truth and falsity, which always makes the least of Hemingway's books compelling.''</p>
        <p>1185 Park Avenue: A Memoir  By Anne Roiphe. Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $13.</p>
        <p>Avoiding sentimentality and self-pity in favor of an emotionally mature distance, the author tells of growing up Jewish in the 1940's and 50's with everything she could want but her parents' affection. ''Roiphe gives her memoir the dramatic vividness of a novel,'' Karen Lehrman wrote in these pages in 1999.</p>
        <p>Apples From the Desert: Selected Stories  By Savyon Liebrecht. Feminist Press, $13.95.</p>
        <p>This collection of 12 stories originally published in Israel focuses on the fault lines between secular and Orthodox Jews, bereft parents and their torn children. ''At her best, Liebrecht is the equal of far better-known Israeli authors like Amos Oz,'' Suzanne Ruta said here in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mother of Pearl  By Melinda Haynes.  Washington Square/Pocket Books, $13.95.</p>
        <p>This first novel revolves around a large cast of characters in sleepy Petal, Miss., in the 1950's, including Even Grade, a black orphan named for a road, and Valuable Korner, a fatherless white girl named after a real estate sign. Last year our reviewer, Roy Hoffman, admired the book's ''profuse and vigorous'' language.</p>
        <p>George III: A Personal History  By Christopher Hibbert. Basic Books, $18.</p>
        <p>As portrayed here, George III (1738-1820) was a churchgoing, monogamous, mostly competent ruler before going famously mad. His oldest son, however, George IV (1762-1830), the subject of Prince of Pleasure: The Prince of Wales and the Making of the Regency, by Saul David (Grove, $15), led the field in scandalous behavior at a time when London was the world's capital for debauchery. '' 'George III' and 'Prince of Pleasure' make a simply unputdownable theater of the personal and political absurd,'' Valentine Cunningham wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>The Houdini Girl  By Martyn Bedford. Vintage Crime, $13.</p>
        <p>After his Irish girlfriend dies in a mysterious train accident, a British magician discovers she led a double life and sets out to unravel her carefully hidden past. Last year our reviewer, Carey Harrison, called this ''a masterfully choreographed'' erotic thriller.</p>
        <p>Poachers: Stories  By Tom Franklin. HarperPerennial, $12.</p>
        <p>Set in lower Alabama, these mordant tales feature sympathetic good old boys stuck in bad situations, frayed marriages and dead-end jobs. ''With this satisfying collection'' Franklin ''establishes himself as one of the region's more interesting emerging voices,'' Bruce Barcott said here last year.</p>
