        <p>THE brides were tacking in white satin, trains billowing, veils lofting like the topsails of the tall ships entering New York harbor.

        <p>THE brides were tacking in white satin, trains billowing, veils lofting like the topsails of the tall ships entering New York harbor. Gliding across a marble expanse, Guatemala circled Korea, with Jamaica and China close at hand. A Salvadoran bridal party sailed toward a Custard Beach outlet, breaking through a throng of tourists gathered for the 18th annual Brown family reunion. Briefly, the wedding group changed course to join the Browns in slurping French ice cream from Belgian waffle cones.</p>
        <p>The setting for this odd apparition was the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center on Fourth of July weekend. Just as a light breeze bellied the white sails floating up the nearby Hudson, blasts of freon-treated air puffed the many net tulle spinnakers indoors. It was a special moment for the people involved, but no special occasion. This sort of thing takes place here all the time. The midpoints of winter and summer are high season for wedding photography in this vast lobby, a de facto chapel of love, which also happens to be a headquarters for Dow Jones, American Express and the accounting romantics at Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p>
        <p>''We've sometimes counted 10 white stretch limos parked at once,'' said Melissa Coley, the World Financial Center's vice president for arts and events.</p>
        <p>The Winter Garden's photo op appeal is obvious to anyone. With a 14-story vaulted atrium paved in tricolor marble, a tiered and platformed Loretta Young stairway and an anomalous grove of 16 50-foot palm trees, it might be the grandest photo studio in New York. Although corporations pay as much as $33,000 to rent it, as a public space it is essentially free. Unlike Conservatory Garden in Central Park, the Angel of the Waters statue on Bethesda Fountain or the Vale of Cashmere in Prospect Park -- other wedding photography favorites -- it is weatherproof. As a bonus, the sun bouncing off the World Trade Center tends to fall through the atrium's glass ceiling, bathing the Winter Garden lobby in lambent pools.</p>
        <p>''The wedding picture thing has been going on since just after the palm trees were put in,'' Ms. Coley said, or since 1987. On a good day there can be as many as two dozen marital parties trooping through. They pose on the stairs, on the plaza, even on escalators, and then proceed to the covered footbridge vaulting Liberty Street, where a floor of coral marble reflects flattering light on brides. ''You see them sitting in the windows looking wistful,'' Ms. Coley said.</p>
        <p>So what if it is not Bachrach Studio? So what if your wedding pictures may contain scores of people you have never met? Does it necessarily detract from the day that perfect strangers stop to ask if you have carefully considered what you are about to undertake? Relatives won't do that. (Well, all right, Uncle Al will.) And relatives are not typically as cute as, say, Nari Lee, 5, and Seri Lee, 3, sisters who insinuated themselves into numerous wedding shots as they twirled down the stairs in petal pink skirts.</p>
        <p>Isn't it possible that the grandkids will enjoy the wedding narrative more if it involves the appearance of unhinged strangers making wisecracks at the tenderest moments? Take the bystander who stopped a bridesmaid during the Jones-Davis wedding photo shoot to ask what is black and white and red all over. The man was wearing a Bazooka-color baseball cap, lime green hot pants and an Abe Lincoln goatee. ''I don't know,'' the bridesmaid replied.</p>
        <p>''The newspaper,'' the man said.</p>
        <p>''Really,'' the bridesmaid said. ''I was thinking something more along the lines of a skunk.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Wing Zhong Lam lifted a bouffant-gowned and radiant Mei Mei Liu onto a planter so a friend could videotape her in the round. Mr. Lam and his wife chose the Winter Garden for their wedding pictures, he said, ''just for, like, a joke.''</p>
        <p>The Lam wedding party was small, principals only, plus a maid of honor in a tinsel tiara and six friends talking on cell phones. If their casual clothes made them look, as David Sedaris once remarked of Americans abroad, as though they had come to mow somebody's lawn, they certainly fitted into the Winter Garden's gorgeous mosaic.</p>
        <p>There was the usual mini-General Assembly on hand: people in saris, in salwar kameez, in skullcaps and side curls, in safari outfits and in crisp white nautical uniforms. There were representatives of the 50 states, most wearing cargo shorts, many packing Snugli baby carriers, all trooping through the atrium in happy surprise as they observed the nuptial costumes and folkways of New York.</p>
        <p>''It's been variable over the years,'' Ms. Coley said of trends in wedding-party costume. ''There was a peach phase in the early 90's. Then that went into pink. Lately, everyone's into purple and a lot of red.''</p>
        <p>For the wedding of Maurice Rico and Judy Lombardi, the four bridesmaids had chosen dresses in tasteful-if-shocking-for-daytime black chiffon. The actual nuptials, which had not yet occurred, would wait until a lunchtime ceremony at Windows on the World. The photo session was scheduled first to capitalize on midday light, gloriously diffused on the stairway between the lobby's revolving doors and the Coco Marina ''outdoor'' cafe.</p>
        <p>''It's great to do marriage pictures here,'' said Edgardo Jiminez, a photographer who uses the Winter Garden for modeling shoots. ''It gives the people a lot of luck. With the water right outside, it's got kind of a holy feeling for me.''</p>
        <p>That was the mood Rudy Pollack, a 35-year veteran of the wedding photography trade, was trying to capture. Sprawled on his stomach across the stairs, he had Ms. Lombardi and her uncomfortable bridegroom-to-be framed in the viewfinder of his Hasselblad. With a series of almost imperceptible hand waves, he subtly managed to direct their poses to the great wedding album cliches: the ''I Got You, Babe'' handclasp, the ''We've Only Just Begun'' embrace and the ''My Heart Will Go On'' middle-distance gaze.</p>
        <p>Then he abruptly waved Mr. Rico out of the frame and got down to the business of commemorating the dress -- a custom-designed strapless confection with an impressively cantilevered bodice and a cloth rose pinning the train. ''I had a vision of something that's good for evening after you detach the train, so you can wear it to a black-and-white affair,'' Ms. Lombardi explained, as an attendant draped satin across the lobby steps in light that caused the fabric to glow.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I do think it's nice getting married in here,'' remarked Charlene Brown, part of the Brown family reunion, happening upon the scene. ''Yes, she is looking really, really cute,'' added Ms. Brown's twin sister, Zoelene, who tactfully waited until she was out of earshot to voice her doubts about the wisdom of using your best dress to buff a lobby floor.</p>
