        <p>Like a grandfather proudly showing off family pictures, Michael Lynne, the new owner of Bedell Cellars, phoned the other day, bubbling with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>''Have you tried Kip's new viognier?'' he said. No, I said apologetically, I hadn't.</p>
        <p>But, I told Mr. Lynne, the president of Time Warner's New Line Cinema, coincidentally I was on the verge of ringing up Kip Bedell, who under the purchase arrangement is staying as winemaker, to inquire about new releases, preferably whites for summer.</p>
        <p>The '98 viognier (pronounced VEE-awn-yay), Mr. Bedell's first, soon arrived, went straight into the refrigerator and, corroborating Mr. Lynne's forecast, proved pleasing and promising.</p>
        <p>Still young and a bit shy, the $18 wine, redolent of peaches and honeysuckle, needed 40 minutes' warming in the glass to deliver the balance expected of good vigonier, as well as first-stage complexity.</p>
        <p>The wine's racy acidity supplies harmony for marine dishes, a characteristic of other early North Fork successes with viognier, at Macari, Martha Clara and Pindar.</p>
        <p>The charming grape and wine (best and most expensively identified with Condrieu, in the northern Rhone, and newly in California) merits East Enders' attention as a welcome variant to the chardonnay deluge.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, Bedell Cellars's regular '96 chardonnay ($10), its pretty aroma full of honey and nuttiness, like the viognier is light-bodied and food-oriented, though less versatile (lobster, with drawn butter, is an obvious candidate). Crisp and zippy, it is still partly introverted, though it unfurls small increments of sumptuousness as it gradually warms up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bedell raises two acres of viognier, plans no further planting, but is open to the idea. I bet Mr. Lynne can be persuasive.</p>
