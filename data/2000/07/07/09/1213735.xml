      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Bears are well into their first full baseball season at Riverfront Stadium in Newark. These Bears, that is. There were Newark Bears a half-century ago, and back then there was another team with an animal tag, the Newark Eagles. They both played in old Ruppert Stadium in the Ironbound district, but never against each other. The Bears were part of the all-white International Minor League and the Eagles in the National Negro League. The game, and the city, in those days is the subject of an exhibition called ''Pride of Newark: Baseball's Bears and Eagles'' at the New Jersey Historical Society into next summer. Using video, sound, photographs and more, the show will go beyond the game to examine the social milieu in Newark. New Jersey Historical Society, a half-block from the performing arts center is at 52 Park Place, Newark 07102; (973) 596-8500. It is open Tuesdays through Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.</p>
