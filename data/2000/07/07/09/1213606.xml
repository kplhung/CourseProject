      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>WHEN the Supreme Court decided on June 28 that the Boy Scouts could bar gay members, it agreed that opposition to homosexuality was part of the organization's ''expressive message.'' This message, the argument went, was right there in the Scout Oath and Law, the guiding principles that generations of boys have had to know by heart and regularly recite, raising their arms in that familiar three-fingered salute and promising to be (among many other things) ''clean'' and ''morally straight.''</p>
        <p>The dissenting justices in the 5-to-4 ruling were perplexed. ''It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles, 'morally straight' and 'clean,' says the slightest thing about homosexuality,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. ''Indeed, neither term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position whatsoever on sexual matters.''</p>

        <p>WHEN the Supreme Court decided on June 28 that the Boy Scouts could bar gay members, it agreed that opposition to homosexuality was part of the organization's ''expressive message.'' This message, the argument went, was right there in the Scout Oath and Law, the guiding principles that generations of boys have had to know by heart and regularly recite, raising their arms in that familiar three-fingered salute and promising to be (among many other things) ''clean'' and ''morally straight.''</p>
        <p>The dissenting justices in the 5-to-4 ruling were perplexed. ''It is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles, 'morally straight' and 'clean,' says the slightest thing about homosexuality,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. ''Indeed, neither term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position whatsoever on sexual matters.''</p>
        <p>Anyone looking for an explicit condemnation of homosexuality by the Boy Scouts has little to go on. The statement posted on the Boy Scouts' Web site after their court victory was a model of tactful restraint: ''We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout Oath and Law. Boy Scouting makes no effort to discover the sexual orientation of any person. Scouting's message is compromised when prospective leaders present themselves as role models inconsistent with Boy Scouting's understanding of the Scout Oath and Law.''</p>
        <p>For slightly more stem-winding, plain-spoken views on scouting's mission and message -- and on moral issues, sexual and otherwise -- the justices might have turned to the first Boy Scout manual, published in 1910 by Ernest Thompson Seton, a founding father of the Boy Scouts. Seton, an author and self-styled naturalist, created the Woodcraft Indians, a precursor of the Boy Scouts, and became the country's first chief scout.</p>
        <p>While ''Boy Scouts of America'' says not a word about homosexuality, it has plenty of other things to say about primal urges and manly passions.</p>
        <p>LAWRENCE DOWNES</p>
        <p>Why scouting? Here's why...</p>
        <p>Degeneracy is the word. To combat the system that has turned such a large proportion of our robust, manly, self-reliant boyhood into a lot of flat-chested cigarette smokers, with shaky nerves and doubtful vitality, I began the Woodcraft movement in America. Without saying as much, it aimed to counteract the evils attendant on arena baseball, football, and racing, by substituting the better, cleaner, saner pursuits of Woodcraft and Scouting.</p>
        <p>Getting together with the guys and some brews to watch the game? Not very manly, in Seton's view.</p>
        <p>The personal interest in athletics has been largely superseded by an interest in spectacular games, which, unfortunately, tend to divide the nation into two groups -- the few overworked champions in the arena, and the great crowd, content to do nothing but sit on the benches and look on, while indulging their tastes for tobacco and alcohol.</p>
        <p>Not that male bonding is a bad thing:</p>
        <p>What is a camp without a camp-fire? -- no camp at all, but a chilly place in a landscape where some people happen to have some things. . . .</p>
        <p>Not in the steam radiator can we find the spell; not in the water coil; not even in the gas-log: they do not reach the heart. Only the ancient sacred fire of wood has power to touch and thrill the chords of primitive remembrance.</p>
        <p>When men sit together at the campfire, they seem to shed all modern form and poise, and hark back to the primitive -- to meet as man and man -- to show the naked soul. Your camp-fire partner wins your love, or hate, mostly your love; and having camped in peace together, is a lasting bond of union, however wide your worlds may be apart.</p>
        <p>The campfire, then, is the focal center of all primitive brotherhood. We shall not fail to use its magic powers.</p>
        <p>The primitive state comes naturally to youngsters:</p>
        <p>The boy from 10 to 15, like the savage, is purely physical in his ideals. I do not know that I ever met a boy that would not rather be John L. Sullivan than Darwin or Tolstoy. Therefore, I accept the fact, and seek to keep in view an ideal that is physical, but also clean, manly, heroic, already familiar, and leading with certainty to higher things.</p>
        <p>Higher things, yes, but there should be time for fun:</p>
        <p>The clubroom must not be made cosey like a lady's boudoir, as the boys must be able to romp in it occasionally, or play handball, or ''Bang the bear,'' etc. So you want furniture that will pack away into a corner, such as folding wooden chairs, small tables and a cupboard in which to put away books, games, etc., when the romp comes on.</p>
        <p>Seton counsels absolute frankness on sexual issues, but when it comes to giving details, he delegates:</p>
        <p>In this handbook I have touched upon many important items of a boy's education, but there is scarcely one more important than that of continence. The prudish mystery with which we have come to veil this important question among the youth of both sexes is doing incalculable harm. The very secrecy with which we withhold all knowledge from the boy prompts him the more to take his own line equally secretly, and, therefore, injuriously.</p>
        <p>I have never known a boy who was not the better for having the matter put to him frankly and fully. For an instructor to let his boys walk on this exceedingly thin ice without giving them a warning word, owing to some prudish sentimentality, would be little short of a crime.</p>
        <p>Everyone should read ''From Youth Into Manhood,'' by Winfield S. Hall, M.D.; sexual hygiene for young men and older boys.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hall's book, which was intended for Y.M.C.A. members, grapples much more directly with the issue of sexuality, though it doesn't even consider homosexuality among the options for ''lusty boys'':</p>
        <p>The young man who holds before his mental vision an ideal of the home he hopes to establish -- in which a pure wife reigns as queen, sovereign of his life, and gently governs her brood of lusty boys and fair girls -- cannot for a moment consider as a sane solution of his sexual problem periodic visits to a lewd girl or woman, nor can he expect to develop his powers physically or intellectually, if he permits himself to contract that habit (masturbation) which, step by step, undermines his virility. There is open to the young man only one of these three alternatives, i.e., ''to lead the continent life.''</p>
        <p>The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man should strive to reach. . . . The compensations of continence are those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in wedlock, and from the consciousness of his ability to establish and maintain a home, and to protect this home against all dangers.</p>
        <p>The Scout Oath</p>
        <p>On my honor, I will do my best</p>
        <p>To do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law;</p>
        <p>To help other people at all times;</p>
        <p>To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.</p>
        <p>The Scout Law</p>
        <p>A scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.</p>
