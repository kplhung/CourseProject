        <p>Three Main Line Philadelphia women who became successful commercial artists at the turn of the 20th century -- it sounds like a Jane Campion movie. But THE RED ROSE GIRLS: An Uncommon Story of Art and Love (Abrams, $39.95), by Alice A. Carter, tells how Jesse Willcox Smith (1863-1935), Elizabeth Shippen Green (1871-1954) and Violet Oakley (1874-1961) became extremely successful illustrators for books and magazines, working in a profession largely dominated by men. They forged an unconventional communal relationship based on passion for their art and love for one another. Under the mentorship of their teacher, the illustrator Howard Pyle, they earned commissions from the nation's most prestigious periodicals, including Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post. (Oakley's paintings now hang in the Pennsylvania state capitol.) Carter, who teaches illustration in the School of Art and Design at San Jose State University, elegantly describes their emotional bond and the factors that caused it to end (one of the women married). Along with their friend Henrietta Cozens, they set up a household at Philadelphia's picturesque Red Rose Inn and called themselves the ''Cogs family,'' a name formed from the initial letters of each of their surnames. In their genteel way these women were rebels, and yet their story, often lyrically romantic, and their resolutely stylized illustrations (beautifully reproduced) were the epitome of respectability.</p>
