        <p>SHRIMP cocktail may be one of America's favorite dishes, but I go along with the great Fats Waller:</p>
        <p>Want some sea food, Mama!</p>
        <p>Shrimpers and rice, that's very nice.</p>
        <p>I love shrimp in risotto, especially when the rice has turned a rich green from herbs stirred in as it cooks and fresh peas tossed in at the end. Shrimp with feta cheese and basil simmered in tomato sauce is a popular Greek dish -- and makes a light meal with a green salad and fruit. But one of the fastest and simplest shrimp dishes of all, from Italy, is made by sauteeing them with garlic and hot pepper flakes. If you soak the shrimp in heavily salted water with ice cubes for an hour or so before you cook them, they will be juicier and have more snap -- a Chinese trick that works.</p>
        <p>Shrimp Risotto With Peas  Total time: 30 minutes marinating, 45 minutes cooking</p>
        <p>1 pound medium shrimp  3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  3 shallots, chopped  1 clove garlic, minced  1 tablespoon unsalted butter  1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dry white wine  About 6 cups boiling fish or chicken stock  1 tablespoon mint, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1/4 cup basil, snipped fine with scissors  2 tablespoons parsley, minced  1 clove garlic, minced  1 cup peas.</p>
        <p>1. Peel the shrimp and put them in a non-corrosive bowl with two tablespoons of olive oil, salt and pepper. Toss and marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Soften the shallots with the garlic in the butter. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for a minute or two until the grains absorb the butter and turn opaque.</p>
        <p>3. Add the wine, bringing it to a boil to evaporate the alcohol. When the wine has been absorbed, start adding the fish or chicken stock, half a cup at a time and season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the mint, basil and parsley. Turn down the heat and keep adding stock, one-half cup at a time, to the rice and stirring. Continue until the rice has absorbed nearly all the liquid. The rice is done when it is creamy, but al dente.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a separate skillet and saute the shrimp for a minute or two. Season with salt and pepper and remove.  Add the shrimp and peas to the rice. Cook for a minute or two, stirring.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Sauteed Shrimp With Red Pepper and Garlic  Total time: 1 hour refrigeration, 6 minutes cooking</p>
        <p>2 pounds medium-size shrimp  2 tablespoons coarse sea salt  2 tablespoons olive oil  2 cloves garlic, minced (green part removed)  1 teaspoon hot pepper flakes (or more, to taste)  1 lemon, quartered.</p>
        <p>1. Peel the shrimp and put them in a bowl of salted water and ice cubes so they are covered. Refrigerate for an hour and drain. Pat them dry with paper towels.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Saute the garlic until it is lightly browned. Add the shrimp and the pepper flakes and saute for three to four minutes or until the shrimp are opaque. Do not overcook or they will be tough and mealy. Correct seasoning and serve with lemon quarters.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This is good with rice.</p>
        <p>Shrimp With Tomatoes, Basil and Feta Cheese  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons olive oil  1 medium onion, chopped  2 cloves garlic, minced (green part removed)  1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, or a 1-pound can peeled  Italian plum tomatoes, chopped  1 cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>1/2 cup basil leaves, snipped fine  1 tablespoon mint, chopped fine  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  Cayenne pepper to taste  2 pounds medium-size shrimp, peeled</p>
        <p>1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled  Mint sprigs to garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet and soften the onion with the garlic. Add the tomatoes, wine, basil, mint, salt, pepper and Cayenne. Simmer for 20 minutes, covered, over medium heat.</p>
        <p>2. Add the shrimp and the feta and simmer over medium heat for five to six minutes, or until the shrimp are cooked through but are not overdone. Then garnish the dish with mint and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This summertime Greek dish is especially good when served with orzo or rice.</p>
