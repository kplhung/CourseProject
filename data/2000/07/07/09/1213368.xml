        <p>Despite his dignified pose and his made-to-order double-breasted suits, Warren Christopher goes virtually unnoticed as he makes his way these days, always unescorted, to the offices of Democratic governors, members of Congress and well-known party members no longer in government. Discretion is what Christopher is about: in his meetings with very important Democrats, aides know to leave the room, and the conversations are off the record. No tape recorder. No entourage. No small talk. Christopher, who is 74, has devoted much of his career to ticklish sub rosa missions. He negotiated the release of American hostages from Iran in 1981. He headed the commission that recommended sweeping changes in the Los Angeles Police Department after the beating of Rodney King. As President Clinton's secretary of state, he drew up a plan for sending American troops into the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Now Vice President Al Gore has dispatched Christopher on what is, in its way, one of the most challenging assignments he has ever taken on: to sort through the weakest Democratic field in modern memory and find the few men or women who could be a next vice president of the United States -- in short, to create the List. Because there is a lack of obvious candidates, Christopher's task is a far more formidable one than he faced eight years ago, when he oversaw Clinton's search for those who might make a vice president. Of course, that means Gore's ultimate choice is harder than Clinton's was. And yet there may be no more consequential decision for Gore: after what seem like interminable reinventions and remakes, the vice president is still struggling to ignite his campaign. It may be that the only way Gore can win in November is if he successfully reintroduces himself at the party's convention in Los Angeles next month. That can only happen if he picks the right running mate.</p>
        <p>Which is who, exactly? Or, first off, what? That's what Christopher wants to know. When he is face to face with prospects, or those suggesting prospects, Christopher's routine is that of the efficient and meticulous lawyer he is. He pulls out a three-ring leather binder and runs down a neatly typed list of questions: What running mate would have the most impact in your state? What type of person do you think the vice president should look for in a running mate? What qualities should that person have? Who might you recommend? How important would it be to pick a woman? Or a minority? What about someone who has never held public office?</p>
        <p>Christopher takes copious notes as his interviewee rattles on about the virtues of assorted prospects (or subtly tries to sell him- or herself). He may make monosyllabic utterances here or there, but he betrays no hint of what he is thinking. He tries not even to smile. If the interviewee is lucky, the big question comes about a half-hour into the meeting. Usually the subject is broached in a manner that could not be more understated: If the vice president wanted to consider you further, what would your reaction be? On occasion, he'll put it directly: How about you?</p>
        <p>While Christopher would not discuss the specifics of how he is drawing up the List, he did recently break his long-held silence about his role and speak to me about how he did it eight years ago -- and his method has not really changed. ''I didn't think I had to ask everyone that question,'' he said, referring to the big one. ''But there were some people who I'd like to know how they react to that question.''</p>
        <p>Christopher insists that when he asks people whether they want to be considered, it is not a throwaway question. ''I don't think I asked that question simply to try to assuage egos or to make people feel good,'' he said. ''It is unfortunate to give people false expectations.''</p>
        <p>It is a long way from identifying prospects to finding the right match. Gore's presence on the ticket eight years ago did not, by itself, win Clinton the White House. But it helped resurrect a presidential nominee who, before the Gore announcement, was stuck in the polls behind President Bush -- and in some surveys, was even trailing Ross Perot. The tableau of Clinton and Gore and their families standing side by side outside the governor's mansion in Little Rock signaled to the country that this ticket was young and vibrant -- and not wedded to the timeworn tradition that a running mate's sole value is someone who can balance the ticket geographically.</p>
        <p>Gore could use that kind of magic. But even were he to dare go for a spine-tingling choice, the problem he faces is that there is a dearth of spine-tingling choices. Republicans eagerly reel off a host of governors and up-and-comers in Congress with compelling biographies, from Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma to Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska to Representative John Kasich of Ohio to Elizabeth Dole. Ask Democrats their favorites, and there is, almost always, a moment of silence. Then they end up resurrecting the names of people who have been passed over before. One close friend of Gore's, a figure in Democratic politics for decades, is downright unsettled. ''Names come up that may be sound but there are no home runs in the crowd. Who is out there who would lead people to say, 'Al Gore strikes a home run'? For the life of me, I can't imagine who it is.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore disputes that there is no future Al Gore. ''There are quite a number of people out there who are at least as ready for the job as I was eight years ago,'' he told me recently. But then, conceding that the next vice president might take some molding, he went on to say, ''The question is how you grow into the job.''</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, when Christopher began his talent search for Clinton, job-ready talent abounded: Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. And there was a centrist, international-minded Southern senator named Gore. His name first made Christopher's V.P. list in April 1992. Clinton was in Tallahassee for a campaign event at Florida A&amp;M (students there questioned his explanations for his experimentation with marijuana and his Vietnam draft status), and at his hotel there one morning he met secretly with Christopher and Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, for a vice-presidential brainstorming session. Clinton's closest aide, Bruce Lindsey, wandered in and out as Clinton and company tossed out names and came up with a list of 38, including 15 that were designated high priority. (Gore was on the prime list from the start.) It was at that meeting that Clinton first emphasized the importance of not being locked in to traditional concerns about ticket balancing, as Michael Dukakis had in picking Senator Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier, when the campaign boasted about a Boston-Austin axis. (A lot of good it did: Dukakis lost Texas.)</p>
        <p>After the Florida meeting, Christopher dispatched a team of lawyers to help prepare preliminary dossiers on the backgrounds of each of the 38 contenders. The only one he did not meet with was the prospect who was the most intriguing: Colin Powell, who at that time had not yet let on that he was a Republican. That delicate task went to Powell's friend, Vernon Jordan.</p>
        <p>When Christopher first interviewed Gore in late May 1992 at the United Methodist Building in Washington, across the street from the Supreme Court, Gore, then a senator, was putting the final touches on his book ''Earth in the Balance.'' Discussing that meeting with Gore, Christopher says he was ''impressed by his intellectual equipment and his high personal standards.'' Others probably would not have been intrigued if Gore showed them corrections he'd made on the galleys, but Christopher was. And he says he appreciated, too, that Gore did not immediately jump at the possibility of being vice president.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a feigned disinterest,'' Christopher says. ''It was simply, he said, that it 'would be a very serious subject for me, and if the governor wants me to think about it seriously, I will.' I was impressed.''</p>
        <p>At that session, Gore, responding to Christopher's usual query, suggested others who might be tapped as Clinton's running mate. Gore says some of those same names are on his list today. He would not name names, however, explaining, ''It's too radioactive right now.''</p>
        <p>After that initial meeting, Christopher reported back to Clinton verbally, to avoid leaving a paper trail. In his understated way, he was glowing, but he prefaced his comments by saying, ''You know, Governor, this has to be your decision. But I had a good session with him.''</p>
        <p>In the first week of June, Clinton narrowed the list to a handful, and, as part of that process, Christopher asked contenders if they were willing to complete a long questionnaire and undergo an analysis of their financial affairs -- including tax returns -- and medical records.</p>
        <p>The one person who made the final short-list but did not want to undergo that personal vetting was Mario Cuomo, who expressed his concerns in a prickly telephone conversation with Christopher. ''He felt that he had been adequately vetted by his running for office in New York,'' Christopher says. In what sounds like a stinging condemnation from someone as mannerly as Christopher, he adds, ''It was a somewhat difficult telephone call.'' (Christopher said that Cuomo supporters later asked that he be reconsidered, but it was too late; Cuomo insists that he never wanted in the job.)</p>
        <p>Gore expressed no such qualms when Christopher tracked him down in Rio, where he was attending an environmental conference. There was one proviso: Gore asked for 24 hours to think over whether he wanted to be a finalist. Some Clinton advisers wondered whether Gore -- who long nursed presidential ambitions of his own -- was playing too hard-to-get. Christopher, having seen people make wrongheaded decisions when they were abroad, approved of his prudence.</p>
        <p>Gore, of course, did not change his mind. He allowed his name to be put forth, as did the four others on the list: Senator Bob Graham of Florida, Senator Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Clinton met secretly with each of these contenders, mostly at the Capital Hilton, a few blocks from the White House. On June 30, Gore was spirited through a back door for what had been planned as an hourlong session, the length allotted for all the finalists. Clinton and Gore started talking at 10 p.m. and were still chatting well past 1 a.m. They got so comfortable that eventually they both stretched out on the floor, their backs against two couches as they faced one another.</p>
        <p>The next morning, Clinton kept his counsel, leaving even Christopher sniffing for clues. But judging by the length of the meeting, he figured Gore had shot to the top of Clinton's mental list, or close to it. Gore had no doubt. Asked last month when he knew the job was his, he replied, ''That night -- if I wanted it.''</p>
        <p>A little more than a week later, the Clintons and Gores introduced themselves to the nation in Little Rock, the most enduring scene of the 1992 campaign. And one that Gore desperately wants to recreate.</p>
        <p>Ask Gore how he will pick a suitable partner, and he provides a response that makes the process sound so utterly logical -- and so easy. ''There is one criterion that overshadows all the others by far,'' he says, ''and that is, Who has the clear ability to become president on a moment's notice should that need ever arise?''</p>
        <p>There is a great deal beyond that one criterion, as Gore well knows -- there is the whole equation of pluses and minuses that is any politician's life, and another equation of costs and benefits that a choice might bring to a presidential ticket. Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois is probably the favorite of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate, and he is a skilled politician who could help Gore carry his must-win state. But Gore has a decent shot at Illinois anyway. Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, is a time-tested politician who is popular with labor and could help carry a vitally important state. But he is the ultimate Washington insider -- and what he really wants is to win back the House so he can be speaker. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts may be closest to the Gore model: he has an impressive biography and he is agile on the stump. But the last place Gore needs help is the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Few of those most widely discussed would bring to Gore something Gore brought to Clinton in 1992: a sense of flair and the future. Voters back then could instantly envision Gore running for president in eight years. Many of the current prospects will be well into their 60's and may seem too old to run in 2008. Gore is now 52. But eight years hence, Graham will be 72; Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, 71; Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, 75; and Gephardt, 67. There are appealing prospects in their late 40's, but they are virtually unknown nationally: Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>A close Gore aide was mulling the choices -- or lack thereof -- one recent night when he came up with the only combination that sounded imaginative, and familiar. ''Could we pick Clinton?'' he asks. (The answer: the Constitution does not prevent a president from being elected vice president.)</p>
        <p>Part of the quandary is that there is no one who solves all of Gore's needs. He wants someone to zip up his persona. But after eight years in Clinton's shadow, he does not want someone with so much zip that the person will overshadow him. He wants a combative partisan who can fearlessly run down Bush in the campaign. But he wants someone who, as vice president, would not make waves or be a threat. He wants someone who can help him carry a battleground state. But he does not want to be accused of picking someone for purely political reasons. He wants someone no one is thinking of to provide some electricity at the convention. But he does not want someone who is so untested that he or she falls flat off the political stage.</p>
        <p>That leaves Gore searching for, well, another Gore. Bill Daley, in an interview just before he was named Gore's campaign chairman, said two of his choices would be Clinton appointees: Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary, and Bill Richardson, the energy secretary. (That was before anyone knew Richardson would have to answer for sky-high gas prices as well as for the disappearance of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons lab.) Daley also mentioned the former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell, and his successor, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</p>
        <p>The only relatively young, attractive prospect that Daley or anyone talks about is Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, who is 44. But he has the misfortune of seeming like a young Gore clone. They are both sons of senators; they both attended the same Washington prep school. Moreover, Bayh falls into the uninspired category of ''safe choice.''</p>
        <p>There just are not that many young Democrats ready for the national stage. The Republicans don't have that problem, thanks in large part to Ronald Reagan. His presidency spurred Republicans to enter politics; it was something of a cause. Many of those Republicans have moved up the ladder to become governors and people on Bush's prospect list. But a Democratic farm team never materialized during the Reagan years -- or the Clinton years. Clinton has so dominated the national stage that there has been little room for anyone to emerge, especially with Congress under Republican rule.</p>
        <p>''I was inspired to get into this business because of the role models there were,'' says Leon Panetta, the former California congressman who was a chief of staff for Clinton. ''They're missing now. That's one of the problems Al Gore is having in looking for someone.''</p>
        <p>Another consideration is that when it comes time for Gore to announce his choice -- probably just before the Democratic convention in mid-August -- Bush will have already made his pick at the Republican convention. So if Bush picks a woman, for example, Gore may feel compelled to as well. The nightmare scenario in the vice president's camp is that Bush, with more choices, will pick such an attention-grabber as his No. 2 that Gore will be especially hard pressed to come up with someone dynamic.</p>
        <p>Gore insists that he's not interested in springing a splashy surprise. That may be because he really doesn't think it matters -- or because there are no splashy candidates and he is trying to lower expectations. ''I don't think the drama has more than transitory value,'' he says. ''It needs to feel right.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not there are captivating democratic prospects out there, there does seem to be no shortage of those who think they would make the ideal running mate. There are no manuals on how to be picked as a potential vice president. The only accepted rule is: don't appear overeager.</p>
        <p>Then there is Senator Graham. Asked why he would be a sound choice, he replied that the answer ''requires one to put their self-effacement on the shelf'' -- which he proceeded to do. ''I have served as governor of the fourth largest state,'' he said. ''And service as governor has been, in the last third of the 20th century, a significant preparation for being president. Witness Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and now Bill Clinton. And now, I have served 14 years in the U.S. Senate, which has broadened my experience. Secondly, I have developed knowledge of the personalities that one deals with in the Congress and would deal with in the executive branch.''</p>
        <p>Others, too, it appears, have shelved self-effacement. Gore campaign aides say they have been struck by the overt efforts by Senator Kerry and Secretary of Energy Richardson to win Gore over. Even prospects who insist that they are not interested happily make a case for their candidacies. Gov. Gray Davis of California says he promised his state's voters that he would stay put. But the famously ''gray'' governor, whose favorite joke is that he has given charisma lessons to the vice president, sounds suspiciously as if he is putting his name forward when he counsels: ''America is not looking for a rock star or a Hollywood figure. They want a solid, tested leader.''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut is only too happy to dispel any concern that as an Orthodox Jew he would not be able to function as vice president on the Sabbath. ''The bottom line,'' he says, ''is I've never been stopped from official responsibilities by my religion, and I'm sure I never would, whatever office I'm in.''</p>
        <p>Prospects are most skittish when asked about their sessions with Christopher. For many, it is the most high-stakes job interview of their career. The etiquette changes with each prospect. Some who have met with Christopher went out of their way not to look as though they were maneuvering for the job and made certain not to tear down rivals. Others happily trumpeted themselves. A few even tore into the credentials of others.</p>
        <p>Durbin devoted much of his session to talking up other names. ''I mentioned if I were to buy futures in a political candidate,'' he recalls, ''I'd buy Evan Bayh.'' (What he may really be thinking is: I'm gracious enough to tout others. So pick me!)</p>
        <p>For all his nonchalance about his interview with Christopher, Lieberman was grateful to learn that the length of his 40-minute session was about average. ''I'm glad to hear he wasn't meeting with anybody for longer,'' he told me, only half joking.</p>
        <p>So what is Gore to do? he needs someone with whom, most of all, he is comfortable, or as Christopher put it, ''Chemistry weighs very heavily.'' The last thing voters want to see is an awkward Al Gore standing beside an awkward running mate. He should take a lesson from Clinton and not worry so much about geographic balance. John Kennedy's pick of Lyndon Johnson in 1960 was the last time a running mate delivered a big state (Texas) -- and a victory in November.</p>
        <p>Gore was not ready to talk in any kind of detail about his choices or his way of arriving at them. What he did seem eager to do was convey that he was relaxed about the process. At the conclusion of our interview, Gore had a question for me. ''How old are you?'' he asked. ''Older than 35?''</p>
        <p>When I told him I pass the Constitutional threshold for the vice presidency, he said, ''Pretty dramatic, don't you think?''</p>
        <p>Yes, a dramatically colossal mistake.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' the vice president said, ''could you explain that to Warren Christopher?''</p>
