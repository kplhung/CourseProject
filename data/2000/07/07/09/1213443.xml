        <p>You're on vacation. Your stress is disappearing but your brain is vegetating. You long for intellectual meat with a spicy sauce. Try a language book.</p>
        <p>''You've Got Ketchup on Your Muumuu,'' by Eugene Ehrlich (Henry Holt, $24), is an etymologist's breezy look at foreign words that have been gulped down by English speakers.</p>
        <p>Ketchup, to begin: this word, meaning ''a condiment of pureed tomatoes, onions, vinegar, etc.,'' is from the Chinese kejap or ke-tsiap, ''fish sauce,'' made of brine of pickled fish. The author notes the variant spelling, catsup, which is what Del Monte labels used to say; my own research shows that since 1988 the Del Monte marketers have fallen into step with Heinz and Hunt's in calling their thick, red stuff ketchup.</p>
        <p>Muumuu was adopted into English from the Hawaiian in the 1920's and is ''the name of a dress, literally, a 'cutoff,' so-called because it has no yoke, the usual top section from which the rest of the dress hangs.'' That fashion definition leaves me a little confused (it's a colorful, loose-fitting variation of the missionaries' Mother Hubbard dress), and I would not hyphenate so called because it is not used here as a compound adjective, but Ehrlich's etymology is sound.</p>
        <p>Most of the borrowings are familiar: the Tagalog boondocks, the Sanskrit guru, the Chinook high muck-a-muck. The German Pickelhaube, however, was new to me. Haube is ''helmet,'' and Pickel has a sense of ''pick ax''; a Pickelhaube is ''a German army spiked helmet of a type worn before and during World War I.'' There's a word to spring on some unsuspecting historian.</p>
        <p>''Word Court,'' by Barbara Wallraff (Harcourt, $24, and whatever became of Brace? I'd like to see a firm of castaway founders, like Brace, Roebuck, Pearce, Fenner &amp; Beane.): Here is a usage guide in question-answer form by the Atlantic magazine columnist and longtime line editor. (A ''line editor'' is a copy editor with a lust to rewrite. Most writers resent line editors because they show us to be sloppy and lazy.)</p>
        <p>Try and or try to? Wallraff advises against the colloquial try and in formal writing and goes on to explain the informal variant as an example of hendiadys, ''a device used as a poetic ornament in Greek and Latin.'' An example is nice and warm to express nicely warm. Try to keep that straight.</p>
        <p>''Gravitas is a word that pundits such as William Safire and William F. Buckley love to use,'' notes a questioner irritated by his inability to find this weighty word for ''solemnity, high seriousness'' in his limited dictionary. Ms. Wallraff responds: ''You're quite right that it is unkind of authors to use unfamiliar words that leave their readers guessing. But aren't you glad that it's not only people with rings in their bellybuttons and skateboards under their toes who are giving us words for the dictionary makers to include in their next editions?'' (Yes, some dictionaries treat bellybutton as one word, but belly laugh, belly flop and belly dance as two. I prefer to keep them all separate until Big Bellyup Day, when we will squeeze them all together at once.)</p>
        <p>For linguistic heavy hitters, M.I.T. Press offers ''Lingua ex Machina,'' subtitled ''Reconciling Darwin and Chomsky with the Human Brain,'' a cross-discipline debate by the neurophysiologist William Calvin and the linguist Derek Bickerton ($26.95). They try to (not try and) resolve ''the apparent paradox that has hag-ridden the human sciences for centuries: that we were produced by the same forces as other species, yet behave so differently from other species.'' Great archaic word, hag-ridden; means ''afflicted by nightmares.''</p>
        <p>Jacques Barzun's ''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life'' (Harper Collins, $36) is cultural history with an attitude: my nonagenarian mentor condemns the severe effects of anything-goes linguistics on education and derides the loosey-goosey notion that ''no native speaker can ever make a mistake.'' The legendary Columbia professor emeritus has turned out a tour d'horizon that is at once a tour de force.</p>
        <p>Euphemism Watch</p>
        <p>In Shakespeare's time, they were called gravediggers. Then they got organized, raised prices and named themselves undertakers. When that acquired a too-gloomy connotation, they changed it to morticians. But now that caretakers have given way to caregivers, and even sharing has been overtaken by caring as the most pious participle, we have -- trumpeted in a reverential, hushed ta-dah! -- the deathcare industry.</p>
        <p>The other major euphemism to burst forth this year is the diplomatic replacement for rogue state. The earliest use I can find of this phrase was in a 1983 Wall Street Journal story noting that smokestack industries have ''won Ohio a largely deserved reputation as a rogue state on the environment.'' Two years later, the columnist William Pfaff first applied it in its current sense: ''The Soviet Union had deliberately isolated itself. Its role was that of a rogue state, a revolutionary power that challenged all the others.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, the phrase has been applied to states like Libya, Iran, Iraq, Serbia, Sudan, Syria and North Korea that supported or condoned the presence of terrorists. Last month, however, on National Public Radio's ''Diane Rehm Show,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright revealed an official smoothing-over: ''We are now calling these states states of concern.'' Asked about this new locution, state spokesman Richard Boucher said of Iraq, a hard-core rogue state in the earlier formulation, that it had become ''a state previously known as rogue.''</p>
        <p>Problem solved; worry removed. Of course, if one of those states of concern gets hold of a nuclear or biological missile, it could be a bonanza for the deathcare industry.</p>
