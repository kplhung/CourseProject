        <p>DAY and night, the plaintive sound of flamenco echoes in the narrow streets of Lavapies, the Gypsy quarter of Madrid. Behind heavy wooden doors and in smoky bars, the flamencos, as the Spanish call those who revel in the ancient Andalusian music and dance, prepare for performances or simply indulge in their art form. In a sense, this is their district, a working-class neighborhood where students of flamenco from all over the world have long come to learn from the masters.</p>
        <p>Martin Santangelo, 38, a born and bred New Yorker, became one of them when he arrived here in 1987 to study flamenco. But he went further than most. In 1993, he established Noche Flamenca, his own company, and married the dancer Soledad Barrio, who became its star attraction. Blossoming, the troupe has gone on to win avid fans in Japan and Egypt and in cities all over the United States.</p>
        <p>''They're brilliant,'' says George C. Wolfe, the artistic director of the Joseph Papp Public Theater, who presented the company at his theater twice last year. ''Soledad is a once-in-a-lifetime performer who combines overwhelming physicality and spirituality.'' Now that Mr. Santangelo and Ms. Barrio have a 5-year-old daughter, Gabriela, she travels with them, often appearing onstage at the end of performances. Before anything else, the troupe is a family.</p>
        <p>Late in May, in the same studios in Lavapies where he first studied flamenco, Mr. Santangelo rehearsed his six dancers and five musicians in preparation for their American tour, which began with three weeks in California and continues at the 180-seat Cornelia Connelly Theater in the East Village from Wednesday through Aug. 13.</p>
        <p>The company will present three new works by Mr. Santangelo, ''A Nuestro Son,''  ''La Plaza'' and a joyful alegrias, plus a full complement of classic flamenco. After the New York engagement, it will be at Wolf Trap in Vienna, Va., Jacob's Pillow in Becket, Mass. and the Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, Ill. until the end of August.</p>
        <p>From the time it developed in southern Spain in the 15th century, flamenco has cast its spell on foreigners with its celebration of nature, the emotions and the erotic. Mr. Santangelo was not immune. ''Oddly enough,'' he says, ''I grew up with flamenco. Flamenco artists regularly stayed with my family in Greenwich Village.'' They went to visit his Argentine mother, Luly Santangelo, a dancer with Alwin Nikolais who now produces Noche Flamenca, and his father, Ed Goldin, a sculptor and scientist.</p>
        <p>After studying acting at New York University, Mr. Santangelo moved to San Francisco to join the theater group El Teatro Campesino. One night, an actor scheduled to dance flamenco failed to show. Mr. Santangelo filled in.</p>
        <p>''I realized that's all I really wanted to do,'' he says. He set off for Madrid and a rigorous apprenticeship. If he hadn't suffered a severe back injury in 1996 while performing in Julie Taymor's ''Juan Darien'' at Lincoln Center, he'd still be dancing regularly. ''My theatrical experience makes me a better director,'' he says.</p>
        <p>There's no air conditioning in the windowless studio where Noche Flamenca rehearses this hot afternoon, but no one expects bright, modern dance studios in Madrid. Lighted by a dull fluorescent ceiling lamp, the one large room is quite sufficient. Flamenco comes across best in intimate situations. Above the wall-length mirror someone has hung two big black and red fans so that they frame a reproduction of ''Las Meninas,'' Velazquez's painting depicting the court of Philip IV. Near the changing area, set off by a pink flowered curtain, a small photo display shows pictures of famous flamenco dancers -- the most dashing, Joaquin Cortes, early in his career.</p>
        <p>In these photographs, Mr. Cortes  bears little resemblance to his picture on the posters, currently plastered on street corners all over town, hyping his show ''Soul'' at the Coliseum Theater. The posters show him glowering, his long hair in disarray and ostentatiously sexy; he looks like a cross between Michael Jackson and Antonio Banderas. Mr. Cortes, now 30, transforms the flamenco artist into a pop star. His style, called ''flamenco fusion,'' often incorporates rock music, strobe lights, pounding percussion and contemporary dance styles. Nothing could be further from Mr. Santangelo's aesthetic. ''We don't use tricks,'' he says. ''You can borrow elements from other artistic languages, but you shouldn't try to speak in those languages.''</p>
        <p>Still a lithe dancer, Mr. Santangelo, his Yankees cap askew, starts rehearsal by clapping his hands in a fast rhythm picked up by the dancers Eva Martin and Alejandra Ramirez. Ms. Barrio, dressed in a plain navy blue sweatshirt and long black shirt, sits absolutely still in a folding chair in the center of the studio, ready for the dramatic dance of loneliness called ''Solea.'' The percussionist Jose Antonio Galicia beats softly on the cajon, a wooden box with the range of a complete drum set.</p>
        <p>WITHIN moments, the two guitarists, Arcadio Marin and Jose Valle ''Chuscales'' join in. Tension builds slowly, erupting only when the singer, Silverio Heredia, gray-haired and bearded, suddenly lets out a long anguished cry. Ms. Barrio rises like a flame, summoned to her feet by his words.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heredia sings of the mysterious nature of love -- its glorious, unexpected arrival and devastating, unexpected departure. Like an animal preparing to fight, she draws up her small compact torso while coiling and uncoiling her hands sinuously at her sides. Then, as if struck by lightning, she stamps her feet once, twice, three times before surging into a wild frenzy of movement, her skirt twirling around her hips, her hair whipping across her tormented face. The strumming accelerates; the singer's voice grows husky, until, as suddenly as she began, Ms. Barrio stops and gazes steadily outward.</p>
        <p>The musicians put down their instruments. ''That's good,'' Mr. Santangelo reassures Ms. Barrio, who looks displeased. Unconvinced, she returns to her original position. They take it again from the beginning. For months, every day, for more than eight hours, he rehearses his company before it goes on tour, which usually means out of the country. Today, flamenco companies do much better abroad than at home. ''Spain is notorious for underrating its own artists until they make a name somewhere else,'' Mr. Santangelo says.</p>
        <p>To him, this is just another fact of life. ''Good flamenco survives,'' he says. ''Its heritage is boundless. When I want something new, I go back. Recently I discovered some beautiful medieval songs. Everyone thought they were new compositions. Others dream of Broadway; I'd like to do an even smaller show, something more austere.''</p>
        <p>Turning to watch Ms. Barrio, he says, ''Flamenco doesn't need extras to blow your mind.''</p>
