        <p>Is there light at the end of the interest rate tunnel? Wall Street seemed to think so last week.</p>
        <p>The stock market rose moderately after reports showed a slowing of the economy, providing evidence that the Federal Reserve's aggressive credit tightening was having an impact. The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999 to keep inflation in check.</p>
        <p>Central bank policy makers meet again on Aug. 22, but many analysts believe they will leave rates unchanged because of weak economic data. Last week, reports showed a slowdown in manufacturing and job growth, as well as sluggish retail sales.</p>
        <p>Rate-sensitive stocks rose, including J.P. Morgan and First Union. But other stocks fell after some warned that corporate earnings would not meet expectations. Losers included technology companies like I.B.M.</p>
        <p>As the economy slows down, we're going to see continued disappointments in earnings, said Larry Rice, chief investment officer for Josephthal &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at 10,635.98, up 188.09, while the Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,023.20, up 57.09.</p>
