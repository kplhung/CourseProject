        <p>WEIRD AL YANKOVIC has two potential problems when it comes to his image, and being taken seriously as a rock star. One, of course, is the ''Weird'' part of his moniker. The second is that he likes to play polkas on his accordion.</p>

        <p>WEIRD AL YANKOVIC has two potential problems when it comes to his image, and being taken seriously as a rock star. One, of course, is the ''Weird'' part of his moniker. The second is that he likes to play polkas on his accordion.</p>
        <p>But guess what? He doesn't want to be taken seriously.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yankovic, an incisive satirist, is one of the most versatile and talented rock stars on the road. While many would not consider putting him in the same category of the artists he parodies, the fact is he can sing like Kurt Cobain, dance like Michael Jackson, play accordion like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar and write as wryly as Barenaked Ladies.</p>
        <p>And those costume changes? He puts Diana Ross to shame.</p>
        <p>''I have so much fun doing this,'' said Mr. Yankovic, who is deep into his current ''Running With Scissors'' tour. ''But this is not a one-man show. My band has a great deal to do with our success.''</p>
        <p>His band is an outstanding group of virtuoso players who add much to the show's theatrics, and is an organic part of the music's genesis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yankovic is the Robin Williams of rock -- a manic pop-culture sponge who delivers the funny goods. (He also writes humorous original material.) And his live show, which he is bringing to Stanhope next Saturday, is a crazy patchwork of first-rate song parodies, hysterical video clips (played during costume changes, including some of Weird Al inserting himself in celebrity interviews), and tireless theatrical production numbers. There is not a lazy moment.</p>
        <p>''I wish I could clone myself sometimes,'' he said. ''There is so much I like to do.''</p>
        <p>That includes directing ingenious videos for himself as well as a wide variety of bands like Jon Spencer Blues Band, Hanson and the Black Crowes.</p>
        <p>From pop-rock to hardcore and rap to folk, Mr. Yankovic captures the spirit of the genre.</p>
        <p>''No act or song is above being parodied,'' he said. And not only does he sound just like the artists he's parodying, he looks like them as well.</p>
        <p>How does he account for his longevity in a field that is populated by one-hit wonders? ''I've just been lucky, and the timing's been good,'' he said. ''I have a knack for it, and I've had good breaks.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why I've lasted longer than some of the people I spoofed.''</p>
        <p>One reason he has found long-term success is his attention to detail. ''We analyze every note of the song we're parodying,'' he said. The frustration he sometimes finds is in having to be current.</p>
        <p>So, what is spoofable today? ''Just look at the Top 10,'' he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>Although he would like people to respect the quality of his work, he can understand why he isn't taken as seriously as his musicianship and talent would dictate. After all, his albums are named ''Dare to be Stupid, ''Even Worse,'' ''Alapalooza,'' ''Bad Hair Day'' and ''Running With Scissors.''</p>
        <p>His parodies range from the alternative -- Offspring's ''Pretty Fly for a White Guy'' (Yankovic's: ''Pretty Fly for a Rabbi''), to hip-hop -- Gangsta's Paradise,'' which he sends up as ''Amish Paradise,'' complete with wild Coolio-style braids.</p>
        <p>And costumes? There's the obese suit and face putty for ''Fat,'' the take-off of Michael Jackson's ''Bad'' (''For the video, I thought how funny would it be to have an 800-pound Michael Jackson trying to get through the subway turnstile'') and the yellow vinyl suits for ''Dare to Be Stupid.''</p>
        <p>For sheer silliness there is ''The Toppings Will Go On,'' a pizza-delivery-themed takeoff of ''My Heart Will Go On,'' or as he refers to it, ''that annoying song from 'Titanic,' '' But for pure brilliance, there's the ''Star Wars'' suite: ''The Saga Begins'' (an ''American Pie'' parody) and ''Yoda'' (sung to the melody of ''Lola'').</p>
        <p>No one is spared, from Madonna to Nine Inch Nails, with Alanis Morrisette and Menudo thrown in for good measure.</p>
        <p>And now, maybe there's an Oscar in his future. (He's already won a Grammy, but they've since dropped his category.) His latest song ''Polkamon,'' is being played over the closing credits for ''Pokemon 2000: The Movie,'' which is opening next week.</p>
        <p>His appeal ranges from his ''severely cultish'' audience members, or Al-coholics, to elementary school kids and their great-grandparents. Many will tell you that this is the third, fourth, fifth time they've caught Mr. Yankovic's show. Many first-timers are pleasantly surprised by this self-described ''wacky guy'' who puts on one of the most entertaining concerts to be seen.</p>
        <p>WEIRD AL YANKOVIC  Waterloo Village, 525 Waterloo Road, Stanhope.  Next Saturday at 8 p.m.  (973) 347-0900.</p>
