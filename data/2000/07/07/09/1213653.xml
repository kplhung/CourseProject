        <p>After an absence of more than 20 years, the Columbus Day Parade in White Plains will return Sept. 23. Mayor Joseph M. Delfino used to attend the parade and wanted to bring it back; no one, he said, could remember why the event had been discontinued. Sponsored by businesses and organizations, including the Sons of Italy, the parade will celebrate the discovery of America and Italian-American culture. The parade is being held before the official Oct. 9 holiday because its rebirth came on short notice and other events were already planned for that day. The two-mile parade route is scheduled to begin at the intersection of Bryant and Mamaroneck Avenues and end downtown on Main Street.</p>
