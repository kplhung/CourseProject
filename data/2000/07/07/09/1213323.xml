        <p>MAP  No More Missing Links</p>
        <p>Finding an errant golf shot among the gorse and pot bunkers at most Scottish links courses is tough enough; finding the courses themselves shouldn't be as difficult. And it isn't, now that the Scottish Tourist Board has come up with a free map locating more than 300 golf courses in Scotland.</p>
        <p>The full-color folding map is useful just as a motorist's guide to Scotland, but it also includes postal and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, amenities, approximate greens fees and thumbnail descriptions of all the courses, along with information on golf passes that could save a player money. For the Golf Scotland map, call the tourist board at (44-8705) 511 511.</p>
        <p>BICYCLE  Power to the Pedals</p>
        <p>Lee Iacocca, the retired automobile executive, gave the world the Mustang and the minivan. Now he's focusing on a more modest development: the E-Bike, which can be rented in Palm Springs, Calif., at the two Marriott hotels and the Hyatt Grand Champions. A 24-volt rechargeable battery system powers the bike when riders tire. It can reach 30 miles an hour, and has a range of 20 miles. Rates are $50 a day or $10 an hour; call (800) 417-3529 for Palm Springs information.</p>
        <p>BOOKS  Reading List</p>
        <p>Longitude Books, a source for travel books and maps, is now online. The service recommends reading lists for destinations worldwide, and the books can be ordered from Longitude. For information, visit www.longitudebooks.com, which includes a search engine that looks up books by subject or author.</p>
