        <p>For Avram J. Bennett, 72, chairman, president and owner of McClelland &amp; Stewart, the Canadian publishing company, finding a successor was a matter of national pride requiring a radical solution.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1906, McClelland &amp; Stewart has nurtured writers like Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje and Farley Mowat, gaining iconic status in a country fiercely protective of its cultural independence.</p>
        <p>With his six children choosing other careers -- and nationalist legislation ruling out sale to a foreign buyer -- Mr. Bennett, known as Avie,  donated 75 percent of McClelland &amp; Stewart late last month to his alma mater, the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>''What better way can there be to safeguard a great Canadian institution, a vital part of Canada's cultural heritage, than by giving it to the careful stewardship of another great Canadian institution?'' he asked last week in announcing  the donation. Random House of Canada, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann of Germany, will buy the remaining 25 percent.</p>
