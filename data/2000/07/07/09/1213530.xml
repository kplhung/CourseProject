        <p>A comparison of the potential hazards of one million picocuries of tritium per liter of ground water at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and maximum acceptable contamination levels of toxic chemicals in Suffolk drinking water can provide some perspective on environmental priorities [''Lab to Pump Tritium From Groundwater,'' July 2].</p>
        <p>The 2000 quality report of the Suffolk County Water Authority lists maximum contamination levels for several herbicides and pesticides and for volatile organic compounds, ranging from about 2 to about 50 micrograms per liter.</p>
        <p>If we take a maximum molecular weight of these compounds of 500, drinking a liter of water a day introduces 6,000 trillion toxic molecules into our bodies. The number of potentially toxic chemical species generated per day from decay of 1 million picocuries of tritium can be shown to be less than one-tenth of this number, closer to one-hundredth.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that direct damage by radiation to genetic material is small compared to damage done by reactive chemical species produced by radiation.</p>
        <p>The range of the electron released in tritium decay is so short that it may rarely reach DNA in the cell nucleus. It would have been prudent to spend a few hundred thousand dollars to determine the mutagenic effect of low-level tritium radiation before spending millions on a cleanup.</p>
        <p>The conclusion that chemical mutation can dwarf the effects of radiation from radioactive decay was pointed out by Prof. Sewell Wright at the University of Chicago 50 years ago. Wright, a Distinguished Professor of genetics, had cages full of mutant animals to prove his point.</p>
        <p>The Water Authority shows pesticide levels as high as 91 micrograms a liter in samples of drinking water. Acceptable levels for tritium in drinking water are very low and inconsistent with levels set for other potentially toxic materials. It appears that those concerned with tritium have missed the forest for the trees.</p>
        <p>If the news media could present the facts to the people, millions could be saved. The politicians responsible for the costly cleanup at Brookhaven, which reduces funds for basic research, have thrown the baby out with the bath water.</p>
