        <p>SUMMER on the boardwalk at Seaside Heights: Ecstatic squeals pierce the night as riders are spun, hurled and whisked aloft on amusement rides along Casino Pier. Fried onions perfume the air. Hordes of revelers parade the planks while a mishmash of signs tempt their craws. CORN! STEAK! BEER! scream the signs. CLAMS! DOGS! FRIES!</p>
        <p>But really, only one food truly says summer. And sooner or later, like ships to the beacon, like moths to the flame, customers succumb to the call of ice cream. But not just any ice cream. This is Seaside Heights, after all, where the cool lick of choice is Kohr's frozen custard.</p>
        <p>The story of the charming blue-and-white custard stands perched on this city's boardwalk could be subtitled ''How the Jersey Shore Changed the Face of American Dessert.'' But no historian would dare tackle it without a gallon of rum raisin at his side. Yes, it is a great story, if only you can keep it straight. Parsing the truth is like keeping track of the various incarnations of Ray's Pizza places in Manhattan: a delicious headache.</p>
        <p>There are actually three companies with the Kohr name selling custard along the Jersey Shore. Two of them reside on the Seaside Heights boardwalk: Original Kohr's and Kohr's Frozen Custard Inc. They sell three main products: hard ice cream, soft-serve and frozen yogurt. (All but the yogurt use a family recipe.) A third company, Kohr Brothers, based in Charlottesville, Va., operates 40 shops in 10 states, 11 at the Jersey Shore. They sell  strictly soft-serve custard, using their family recipe.</p>
        <p>Climb up all three family trees and you reach a dairy farm in York County, Pa., at the turn of the last century. Here lived four Kohr brothers: Archie, Morgan, Clair and  Elton. According to Jane N. Kohr, executive vice president of Kohr Brothers, life changed forever for all four when Archie Kohr, the eldest and a schoolteacher, bought a commercial ice cream maker from a local company and whipped up a batch so unpalatable that he redesigned the machine. ''He was a bit of tinkerer,'' said Mrs. Kohr,  whose husband, Randolph, president of Kohr Brothers, is Archie's son by his second marriage. ''Inventions run in the family. That's just the way these men are.''</p>
        <p>In time, Archie struck gold. His new machine spewed forth a stream of soft ice cream. His recipe is still proprietary, but the company will allow that his secret ingredient was whole eggs. In France and England, a custard is not a custard without milk or cream, sugar, flavorings and egg yolks. While eggs impart a richer flavor, most  American ice creams omit them entirely because they are costly and require special handling in production. Mr. Kohr probably didn't know it, but he was following an example set by Thomas Jefferson, who  brought this so-called ''French-style'' ice cream to the Americas.</p>
        <p>Encouraged by relatives, goes the Kohr Brothers story, Archie and his brothers hauled their apparatus by train to Coney Island in 1919, assembled ingredients from local merchants, backed the machine into  an alley and started selling. In a weekend they sold more than 18,000 nickel cones. ''They were completely unprepared for what happened,'' said Mrs. Kohr. ''The police had to be called in to control the crowds.'' Though the boardwalk teemed with other ice cream vendors, people flocked to the Kohrs.</p>
        <p>The rest was history. Sort of. According to Kohr Brothers, Archie went on to buy the patent for the original machine, to patent his own device and to design still more variations. With his brothers' help, they say, Archie racked up 48 stores along the East Coast from Boston to Florida, effectively bringing soft-serve custard to the world.</p>
        <p>Not so, say the Seaside and Point Pleasant Kohrs. They say it was Elton D. Kohr, the youngest brother, who actually concocted the  recipe, designed and patented the critical ice cream maker, and brought his brothers into the business. Elton's grandson Greg Kohr, of Original Kohr's at Seaside Heights, said his grandfather severed ties with his brothers at some point, opened his own stands in Seaside Heights, Asbury Park, Atlantic City, Point Pleasant  and Seaside Heights, and sold custard at state fairs when the summer season dried up. Elton's descendants still fire up barrel-sized ice cream makers or ''batch machines'', which they say Elton invented, though usually to make hard ice cream. ''I have documents from my grandfather's business that have his name on the patent,'' said Greg Kohr, 42.</p>
        <p>Kohr Brothers contends that Elton, the youngest of the family, would have been too young to pull off such a string of accomplishments in the time before frozen custard made its Coney Island debut in 1919.</p>
        <p>Archie Kohr died in 1960 at age 68. His family, and the families of his other two brothers, remain active in the Kohr Brothers enterprise to this day. In the mid-1990's, the chain stood at six stores before shareholders began aggressively marketing the frozen custard concept.</p>
        <p>They expect to have as many as 600 stores in the nation in the next five years. Ocean City is their biggest hub on the Jersey Shore, with four stores along the boardwalk. But Kohr Brothers shops can be found in such land-locked places as the Deptford and Bridgewater Commons malls. Several years ago, said Jane Kohr, Kohr Brothers agreed to allow Elton's heirs to keep the classic blue lettering that spells out the name KOHR'S on their stands.</p>
        <p>As for Elton, he lived into his 80's and worked the stands he owned with his family. Kohrses grew up napping among cone boxes as infants, playing in empty ones as toddlers and learning to stack them as teenagers. Family members recall Elton slicing California oranges for the family's signature drink: ice and freshly squeezed orange juice, whipped to a frothy head. ''He was a mild-mannered man,'' said one Kohr relative. ''You couldn't find a better man.'' He died a decade ago, said Greg Kohr, but as long as he was able, he would dress in jacket  and tie, leave his home in Asbury Park and head to the boardwalk to taste each of the family concoctions. Not to cloud his palate, he used a different spoon for each taste.</p>
        <p>At Elston's behest, on his death, the business called Kohr's was further split between the families of his son, Elton Jr., and his daughter, Miriam. Ms. Kohr, now 76, operates three Kohr's Frozen Custard locations: two at Seaside Heights and one on the Point Pleasant boardwalk, with the help of her husband and her grandson, Bruce Kohr.</p>
        <p>Betty Kohr, 70, wife of Elton Jr., runs three Original Kohr's on the Seaside Heights boardwalk with her son Greg Kohr, 42.</p>
        <p>Three companies, three different yet similar names. Got it?</p>
        <p>The six stands are all that remain of Elton's custard legacy. Though somewhat less glitzy than the Kohr Brothers franchises, they are in their own way triumphs of regional Pop Art: stark white against the  Jersey sky, their facades glow with that stylized blue logo and images of squeezed oranges, fountain drinks and cones filled with creamy swirls. And there is something equally artistic about the ice cream itself: twists shot through with ribbons of color. When a Kohr's employee hands off a cone, first-time customers are likely to sigh. Or, as one mother was heard telling a child in a stroller one weekday: ''Look, how pretty!''</p>
        <p>Should you order a triple scoop of the ''hand-dipped,'' (hard) variety -- banana fudge nut, butter pecan and chocolate-chip mint, say -- and ask for it in a cup at Original Kohr's, you'll get your goodies in a green-and-white paper cup that dates the dynasty from 1919. Meanwhile, just a few steps away, Kohr's Frozen Custard proclaims that it's been in business ''Since 1923,'' the date, said family members, when Elton came to Seaside. Such discrepancies may be spotted by diehard fans, but they surely don't mull them over for long.</p>
        <p>No one goes to the beach to contemplate history.</p>
        <p>Customers swear by the Kohr product they know best. And the pleasure they take in recalling the ice cream seems forever bound to time and place. ''Any time anyone talks about the shore, they go, 'You know  Kohr's? You ever had a Kohr's?' '' said Bruce Kohr, Elton's great-grandson. ''And everyone else'll say, 'I had an ice cream  there! I had an ice cream there!' ''</p>
        <p>Bruce Kohr typically works 16-hour days behind the counter at Kohr's Frozen Custard. Even at age 24, he has met countless customers who feel privileged to share their shore stories with a Kohr, any Kohr. One by one they stand before the light of the custard palace, place their orders, and summon their memories.</p>
        <p>''I used to work here once,'' they say. ''We used to come here when we were little,'' they tell their children. And when the order comes, they shell out cash, snatch some  napkins, and say goodbye. They take their cones and disappear into the boardwalk night.</p>
