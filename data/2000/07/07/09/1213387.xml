        <p>BERNARD F. CURRY JR. of Scarsdale loves a good party. The chairman of CurryCorp Auto Group recently celebrated his 80th birthday with 80 -- the number was no coincidence -- family members and friends at the restaurant Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The guests included former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a personal friend of Mr. Curry's son-in-law, William O'Shaughnessy, owner of WVOX and WRTN radio stations in New Rochelle and something of a celebrity in his own right. Among those extending birthday wishes were Andrew P. O'Rourke, former county executive and now judge of the New York State Court of Claims, and Sirio Maccione, owner of Le Cirque, and his wife, Egidiana, who were in the pleasant position of being party guests at their own establishment. And from Madison Avenue came a hand-delivered note from Archbishop Edward M. Egan, the first official letter he had written as archbishop of New York.</p>
        <p>But fun and celebrities are something that Mr. Curry can dispense with in a minute when he has to; in fact, he is an admitted workaholic. At 80, he still goes in every day to his office on Central Avenue, across the street from his flagship dealership, Curry Chevrolet. His company, which includes eight dealerships in Yorktown and Scarsdale and one in Atlanta, had sales of $280 million last year, selling 10,500 cars and trucks. It is one of the last remaining independent, privately owned auto groups in the United States, he said.</p>
        <p>Ask about his success, and the answer is almost terse.</p>
        <p>''Hard work,'' he said. ''Just a lot of hard work. I'm up every day at 6 a.m. and make the one-minute commute from my house and go to my office. I don't know what else I would do with my time.''</p>
        <p>The automobile business is part of Mr. Curry's pedigree. He was born in Washington Heights, where his father, Bernard F. Curry, owned a dealership. In 1928, when he was 8, the family moved to the Tudor-style house on Inverness Road in Edgemont that he still lives in. Sundays, he recalled, everyone would get into the car and go for a drive on the Bronx River Parkway.</p>
        <p>By the late 1930's, weekends also meant visits from a customer who had become a family friend: ''My father and I played golf with Babe Ruth. That was kind of neat.''</p>
        <p>From the time Bernard F. Curry Jr. was old enough to work, he did, beginning as a mechanic's helper. After high school he went to Dartmouth, where he majored in economics; during summer and winter breaks, he could be found working at one of the dealerships his father opened in Westchester.</p>
        <p>''I always assumed I'd go into the family business,'' he said. He began selling in 1949 and in 1955 he opened a dealership of his own, Curry Chevrolet on Central Avenue. He sold coupes and sedans that retailed new for about $1,200.</p>
        <p>By 1980, the company had expanded to include Honda vehicles as well as Chevrolets. ''The Americans were building cars that just did not step to it,'' he said. ''But the Japanese were doing a bang-up job.'' American cars, however, have now improved, he conceded: he drives a 1994 eight-cylinder Cadillac Brougham.</p>
        <p>When he wasn't working, Mr. Curry played golf almost obsessively and became a member of Winged Foot Golf Club of Mamaroneck. He learned to ski and bought a home in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he still skis and does skeet shooting. He also became a licensed jet pilot, flying his own private plane until 10 years ago, when deteriorating eyesight grounded him.</p>
        <p>''If I couldn't do something well, I didn't want to do it,'' he said. ''If I wanted something, I dogged it to death till I got it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry, who is divorced, raised six children: Nancy Curry O'Shaughnessy of New Rochelle, Robin Bernacchia of Yonkers, Leigh Young of Mount Kisco, Diane Trimper of Palm Beach, Fla., Barbara Curry James of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, and Bernard Curry III of Rye.</p>
        <p>At the birthday celebration, they exuded the same kind of physically fit, sun-tanned self-confidence as their father, and they spoke of him with obvious pride. ''He taught us to ski, swim, to do anything; he was very strict, but loving,'' Ms. Bernacchia said.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Shaughnessy added: ''He is a great golfer, skier, businessman. At business, it was all business, no fooling around. He taught us, Don't expect anything. You have to work for everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Curry himself, however, he was clearly enjoying the party, the lobster salad, the fillet of sea bass, the rack of lamb, the hot chocolate souffle and the dark chocolate birthday cake, the vintage wines and the Champagne toasts raised in his honor. He liked going from table to table, greeting friends, family and business associates. But when people asked him, ''How are you doing?'' he merely laughed and replied, ''I'm still above ground, so that's pretty good.''</p>
