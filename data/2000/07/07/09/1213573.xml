        <p>THE SETTING -- A quiet corner of a busy harbor, just south of Governors Island. On Monday, 30 intrepid souls plunged into the murky waters there, not only to escape the heat but also to make an ecopolitical point. The Swim-In, organized by the Working Waterfront Association and Swim the Apple, two groups that advocate greater use of the city's waterways,  was staged to prove that the harbor can be swum without fear of undue goo or exotic infections, and to promote the building of a swimming beach on Governors Island.</p>
        <p>As ships from foreign lands glided silently past in preparation for OpSail, swimmers dove from the tugboat Bertha, surrounded by their own little flotilla of Coast Guard and police vessels that hovered nervously during the hourlong swim.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- ''It's probably the second-worst day of the decade to do this,'' said Adam Brown, president of the Working Waterfront Association, as ships and dinghies of every description arrived for the Fourth of July festivities (which would have been the worst day). ''But it's a great day for a swim.''</p>
        <p>The 30 lucky bathers -- Mr. Brown said four times as many had wanted to take part, but nervous Coast Guard officers had limited the number -- whooped and heehawed as they dove into the water, which was a gentle 70 degrees at the surface but much colder a few feet down.</p>
        <p>At first, some swimmers were squeamish about entering waters historically known for toxic chemicals, and even corpses (''floaters''). But the water is much cleaner than in years past, and once the swimmers entered it, enthusiasm reigned.</p>
        <p>''Now this is great swimming,'' said Steve Wolf, a Brooklyn resident.  ''It figures that a simple swim would become political. But this is New York, and if I'm being used as a political tool, I'm a happy tool.''</p>
        <p>Other happy tools were Erik Baard and Robert Roberg, members of Swim the Apple, who often ignore city health regulations that prohibit entering a river. ''We call it stealth swimming,'' Mr. Roberg said.</p>
        <p>On this day, Mr. Baard took his swimming freedom further, removing his bathing suit underwater, just feet from chuckling marine policemen. ''Naked Flying Dutchman off the port side!'' he shouted.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Erik!'' someone shouted back. ''That water's not as murky as you think.'' Mr. Baard scrambled back into his swimsuit.</p>
        <p>On the way back to shore, people pondered what they had done. John Rice said the harbor was ''more aqueous than I thought.''</p>
        <p>''I expected bisque, or chowder, but it was a broth,'' Mr. Rice said.</p>
        <p>Still, he felt a little sticky. ''I don't know,'' he said. ''Maybe I should cancel that chemical peel at the spa.''</p>
