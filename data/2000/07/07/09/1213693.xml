        <p>Defying the Vatican and right-wing political groups, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully in a gay pride parade through central Rome today.</p>
        <p>The parade was one of the last and most contested events of the weeklong World Pride Roma 2000, an international gay festival that was timed to coincide with a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church and that the Vatican fiercely opposed. As it turned out, however, the parade was calm, peaceful and, according to some participants, a little duller than recent gay pride parades in New York, Paris and London.</p>
        <p>Police officers had braced themselves for possible violence after Forza Nuova, a neo-Fascist group, vowed to stage a counterdemonstration and to prevent gay marchers from approaching the Colosseum. But Forza Nuova canceled its plans this week, citing the death of the 13-year-old daughter of a leader of the group. Many center-left politicians marched in the parade, and so did a few center-right politicians.</p>
        <p>The city of Rome, which had approved the parade three years ago, withdrew its support after the Vatican made its opposition known. City officials had said marchers would not be given permission to march around the Colosseum. But late in the week, Rome officials and parade organizers reached a compromise on the parade route, agreeing that the marchers would file past the Colosseum but not circle it entirely.</p>
        <p>''I was expecting more disturbances -- this is much calmer than gay pride parades in New York,'' Michael Lavelle, 48, a telecommunications manager from New York City, said as he marched back to Circus Maximus, Rome's oldest sports arena, which has been the headquarters of the World Pride event. Mr. Lavelle, who was in a group of 150 New Yorkers, said he and others had decided to come to Rome ''once we heard there was a problem with the church.''</p>
        <p>Parts of today's parade, which included many of the sights and sounds that the Vatican dreaded -- drag queens, scantily clad male gladiators, topless women and outrageous floats -- were broadcast live by Italian television, along with panels of commentators fiercely arguing the church's position and that of gay rights advocates.</p>
        <p>But some marchers said the Rome parade was bland compared with other gay pride events. ''Paris was a lot more fun -- there was more music, more dancing,'' said a Belgian who would give his name only as Patrick and who said he had taken part in gay pride parades in France, the Netherlands and Germany this year. ''I am a little disappointed. I guess that is because this is Rome and the pope has a lot of power.''</p>
        <p>The gay rights movement in Italy -- a country that never had anti-homosexual legislation, even under Mussolini -- has never been as powerful as it was in the United States or Britain and Germany, and the World Pride festival and the controversy around it brought new attention to gay rights issues in Italy.</p>
        <p>By the standards of Italian society, which tends to be permissive as long as people keep their activities private, the sight of so many gay marchers was startling.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the Vatican should have tried to prevent this,'' said Marina Fidanza, 65, a grandmother who watched from a park above the Colosseum. ''I am a Catholic, but how can you stop it. This is Rome after all.'' She was watching, as she put it, to ''get a sense of what all this fuss is about.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''But this whole showing off of sexual orientation seems a bit much to me.''</p>
