        <p>Marni Ruth Runyon and Russell Lee Kriegel were married last Monday by Rabbi Robert Scheinberg at the Forsgate Country Club in Monroe Township, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kriegel, 32, is an assistant research scientist in the child psychiatry department of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan. She is a daughter of Carol and Stanley Runyon of East Brunswick, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kriegel, 34, is a senior architect for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in Manhattan. He is the son of Lillian and Roland Kriegel of Bridgewater, N.J.</p>
        <p>The couple, who graduated from Cornell University and later lived within two blocks of each other in Hoboken, N.J., did not meet until 1994, when both were invited to a going-away party in Manhattan for a co-worker of Ms. Runyon's. The two then shared a cab on the ride back to Hoboken.</p>
