        <p>IN the late morning of July 15, the ship known as the Freedom Schooner Amistad will sail into its home port in New Haven harbor. Thousands of people are expected to welcome her. During the ship's initial nine-day trip, many people will have a chance to step on board the replica of a ship where in 1839 53 Africans, destined for slavery in Cuba, revolted and took over the ship.</p>
        <p>The story of their odyssey to Connecticut and eventual return to Africa has become an inspiring saga of the triumph of the human spirit and of interracial cooperation.</p>
        <p>New Haven was central to the story, so it was only natural for the city to want to be the ship's home port. ''The community that embraced the stolen captives from Sierra Leone was from New Haven,'' said Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ''They housed them. They defended them, and they provided the resources to support the efforts going to the Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano said although the ship will not spend many days actually at berth in New Haven, ''the Amistad will still be the centerpiece for the development of the waterfront, because it's a vessel, but also because it's a powerful and unique New Haven story that has national significance.''</p>
        <p>To accommodate the ship and its visitors, a handicapped-accessible floating dock was built and electrical capacity was expanded on the pier.</p>
        <p>Mayor DeStefano said the long-term plan is to fill in a portion of the harbor by the pier, move the Yale boathouse to the pier, and permanently berth the Amistad there with support facilities, including displays and educational materials, and commercial and retail activities as well. South of the pier, the plan is to enhance the open space along the waterfront. The city has applied to the State Department of Environmental Protection for construction permits.</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, New Haven has generated a cottage industry of Amistad affiliations. But before 1989, the Amistad was hardly a household word. Will Mebane of Hamden, a vice president of Amistad America, the nonprofit corporation responsible for building the ship, said, ''When I came to Connecticut 20 years ago, I'm embarrassed to say I'd never heard of the Amistad.'' Since learning about it shortly after his arrival, Mr. Mebane said he has tried to be ''one of the keepers of the flame'' of the Amistad story in New Haven.</p>
        <p>The local group that was most responsible for expanding awareness of the ship -- and the struggle it exemplified -- was the Amistad Committee. The group was founded in 1988 when the pastors of two of New Haven's Congregational churches -- Center Church on the Green and Dixwell United Church of Christ -- decided they wanted to raise awareness of the Amistad and its importance, continuing the legacy their churches had begun in 1839 in fighting to free the captives. The group took the same name as the original group of abolitionists who defended the Amistad Africans and began organizing events to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the uprising.</p>
        <p>Al Marder of New Haven, the president of the committee, said he learned about the Amistad as a child. He said the committee operated on two tracks: creating a permanent memorial to the heroes of the Amistad revolt, and educating both children and adults about its lessons -- the humanity of all people, the importance of standing up for justice, the victories that could be won through interracial cooperation.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the statue of the leader of the revolt, Sengbe Pieh -- known by his Spanish name Cinque -- was dedicated in front of New Haven City Hall. Mr. Marder said the committee  raised some of the money for the statue by putting collection jars in houses of worship, businesses and schools all over New Haven.</p>
        <p>The committee also produced a curriculum and a video about the incident.</p>
        <p>After the dedication of the statue, four groups came together to push for building a replica of the Amistad: Amistad Affiliates, which was the first group organized specifically to promote a replica; the Connecticut Afro-American Historical Society; Mystic Seaport and the Amistad Committee. They joined to form Amistad America. With the support of then-Governor Lowell Weicker and State Representative William Dyson, a Democrat of New Haven, the state offered $2.5 million in bonding to build the ship if the new organization raised $700,000 in private funding.</p>
        <p>The next project the Amistad Committee helped birth was the Connecticut Freedom Trail. With more than 80 sites around the state, it tells the story of the struggle against slavery and for equality. ''The Amistad story dominates the Freedom Trail,'' Mr. Marder said.</p>
        <p>The Amistad also forged a relationship with Sound School, a public high school on New Haven's waterfront that teaches academic subjects through hands-on projects, such as boat-building. A collaboration begun in 1998 between the school and Mystic Seaport enabled several students to spend up to nine weeks working on the Amistad at the seaport's shipyard.</p>
        <p>It was an unforgettable experience, said Mike Smith and Stacey Burwell, two students who just graduated.</p>
        <p>''We got to work side by side with the experts,'' Ms. Burwell said. ''We sanded a lot, did rigging work, hammering, sawing. I learned what it's  like to have an actual job, where you work for eight hours a day, and you have the experience of working with other people, getting along.''</p>
        <p>They were also two of many students at the Sound School who built  the Margru, the captain's boat on the Amistad. It was named after one of the four children aboard the original Amistad. Margru returned to Sierra Leone in 1841, but she came back to the United States to attend college, went back to Africa and raised a family, and her son returned to New Haven to attend Yale Divinity School.</p>
        <p>Ken Donovan, a shipwright and instructor at the school, said his students became very involved in the project. ''This was the first time in 20  years of teaching here that I had 100 percent attendance and 100 percent  participation.''</p>
        <p>He said two positions on the crew of the Amistad have been endowed for Sound School students, who will fill them on a rotating basis. The ship will visit Connecticut cities, including Middletown, Hartford, Bridgeport and New London, for the first year, then head up and down the East Coast and to the Great Lakes. Other plans include trips to Cuba, where the Amistad voyage originated, and to Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>The newest connection between the city and the Amistad story is the new state charter school, the Amistad Academy. It opened as a middle  school for fifth and sixth graders in 1999, with plans to expand through  eighth grade. The school's executive director, Dacia Toll, leads the 84  students each morning in a chant that promotes the school's values: respect, enthusiasm, achievement, citizenship and hard work. One of the aspects of ''hard work'' is the school's longer day, more than nine hours, and longer academic year at 195 days.</p>
        <p>The arrival of the Amistad on Saturday will include three days of celebrations, including luncheons and dinners and an all-day festival at Long Wharf on Saturday. Sandwiched between performances by the New Haven Symphony and Melba Moore on the Green Saturday evening, Harry Belafonte will receive a lifetime award from the Amistad Committee and Amistad America.</p>
