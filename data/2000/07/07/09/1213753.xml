        <p>As soon as Chuck Knoblauch motored around first base and then ducked his left shoulder slightly while passing Todd Zeile, Lee Mazzilli moved out of the coach's box and started pointing and screaming. Mazzilli told the umpire Robb Cook that Zeile had obstructed Knoblauch, and Cook instantly waved his arms and made that exact call.</p>
        <p>It no longer mattered that a diving Jay Payton had scooped up Knoblauch's liner in shallow center field and had thrown him out at second base. Once Cook ruled that Zeile had interfered with Knoblauch, Knoblauch was permitted to stay planted on second and he quickly scored the Yankees' first run.</p>
        <p>Of course, that call caused Mets Manager Bobby Valentine to burst out of the first-base dugout like a desperate fan trying to shuttle between two games in two stadiums on the same hectic day. The first game of yesterday's doubleheader was one pitch old and there was already a delay and already a controversy, with Valentine having a featured speaking role before he was ejected.</p>
        <p>''It was a delayed call,'' Valentine said. ''I thought Lee did a very good job of coaxing a young umpire into a bad call.''</p>
        <p>But Mazzilli refused to take credit for his important contribution to the Yankees' 4-2 victory over the Mets and said: ''I don't think I coaxed the umpire by any means. I just said and called what I thought I saw.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was four steps past first when he first encountered Zeile, who was 25 feet off the base and to the left of the baseline. It did not seem as if Knoblauch slowed down upon passing Zeile and television replays indicated that the players never made contact. Still, Cook, a first-year umpire, reacted after Mazzilli's plea, even as Knoblauch headed toward the dugout. Then Valentine had a strong reaction.</p>
        <p>Valentine shouted at Cook and the other three umpires and kept pointing to Knoblauch's footprints to show how he had traveled unimpeded. After Valentine was booted from the game, he walked beside Knoblauch's footprints and asked the umpires to study the evidence. But they did not budge.</p>
        <p>With his hands in his pockets and his face flushed, Valentine spent four minutes badgering the umpires as Mets fans howled. Valentine finally trudged to the clubhouse and the Mets protested on the basis of the umpires misinterpreting the rule.</p>
        <p>''His steps were marked clearly in the dirt,'' Valentine said. ''There was straight steps from first base going around a straight path to where he went to slide. If you're obstructed, you're going to have a step that's out of stride if there's no contact. It's easily seen.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch said that he had to take a ''wider route'' because of where Zeile was standing. But Zeile said that he was at least 12 feet out of the basepath and was shocked that Knoblauch ran past his right shoulder instead of taking an inside route.</p>
        <p>''The path was so wide,'' Zeile said. ''If I had obstructed his path, he didn't alter his path.''</p>
        <p>But Dana DeMuth, the crew chief, said: ''If he makes the runner alter his course, that's obstruction. There doesn't have to be intent.''</p>
        <p>Three innings later, there was more controversy when Knoblauch and Zeile were involved in another obstruction play. Zeile was on first with two outs when Payton hit a slow grounder to second and Knoblauch charged forward to corral it.</p>
        <p>As Knoblauch readied to field the ball, he seemingly braced for an impact with Zeile and the ball slithered by him. Zeile collided with Knoblauch after the grounder was past him, knocking him to the ground and sending his glove flying. Even though the runner has to give the fielder room to make a play, Zeile did not hit Knoblauch while he could still make a play and Knoblauch seemed to do more to initiate the contact.</p>
        <p>Still, Mark Carlson, the second-base umpire and one of three rookies on the four-man crew, pumped his fist to call Zeile out for obstruction. A player could go a full season without being involved in an obstruction play, but Zeile and Knoblauch were involved in two in four innings.</p>
        <p>''The obstruction was made on Knoblauch's play with Zeile,'' Valentine said, referring to the infield collision. ''The ball was already by Knoblauch, and he then interfered with the runner. When the ball is by Knoblauch, he can't interfere with my runner.''</p>
        <p>DeMuth has 16 years of experience. But Carlson became a National League ump last Aug. 1, and Cook and Rob Drake -- who umpired third base -- are fill-ins. It was an inexperienced quartet for such a momentous series, and the two calls against the Mets helped doom them.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if that was it,'' Valentine said. ''Either one of them changes the game pretty dramatically, I think.''</p>
