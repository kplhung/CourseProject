        <p>The Democrats yearn to be manly.</p>
        <p>First Al Gore had his alpha coaching. Then Richard Gephardt gave lawmakers warrior lessons, screening clips from the movie ''Gladiator'' at the Capitol before the recent Medicare clash with Republicans.</p>
        <p>The House leader might want to show his gang the ''X-Men'' movie, about superhero mutants who cleverly change color and appearance.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' very own Mutant Master is getting ready to show off his latest metamorphosis at the Los Angeles convention. Mr. Gore must reintroduce himself to an electorate already suspicious of his serial reintroductions. It's tricky, because the question is the answer. Who is Al Gore? Al Gore is the man who keeps remaking Al Gore.</p>
        <p>The reinventor of government can't stop reinventing. But the national stage is not the place to figure out who you are. Consider Hillary with her 83 hairdos.</p>
        <p>The vice president's story arc doesn't exactly track. First, he goes on a monthlong ''We're Fat And Happy and Let's Keep the Prosperity Going Tour,'' trying to get credit for something he actually deserves some credit for. Then, on Friday, at the very end, he retools himself as champion of the little guy, bashing big business -- drug companies.</p>
        <p>The Fiery Populist went after the pharmaceutical front group, Citizens for Better Medicare. Oops. Turns out Mr. Gore's message guru, Carter Eskew (who made a fortune on ads for Big Tobacco), pitched the group to handle its TV advertising before he joined the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Democrats watch Mr. Gore flopping and yearn for consistency.</p>
        <p>''I don't care if he says he's an Italian Communist,'' says one. ''I just want him to get something he's comfortable with and believes in, that doesn't come from focus groups, and stop hand-wringing.''</p>
        <p>The truth about political commitment is that people only get excited about a cause or candidate that stays the same today and tomorrow and the day after.</p>
        <p>''Gore struggles to get into the place he wants to be,'' says the California Democratic strategist Bill Carrick, ''while Bush is this Southern-fried-Tom-Dewey-stay-out-of-traffic-don't-say-anything-controversial-run-for-an-hour-in-the-middle-of-the-day-and-I-have-to-get-to-the-ranch-by-the-weekend.''</p>
        <p>Democrats find themselves in a topsy-turvy world where their issues and their candidates at the Congressional level are stronger than their presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>The governor and the vice president seem frozen in a high school tableau of the guy in the back of the room throwing spitballs (as W. used to do at baseball owners' meetings) and the guy up in front turning in the guy in back for throwing spitballs.</p>
        <p>Given the choice between the pious smarty-pants and the amiable idler, Americans may prefer the latter -- unless the debates show that his idling has left him grossly unprepared.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's biggest problem is that people don't like to like him, even when they like him. He comes across as a man who calculates every gesture. He even checked with Mr. Eskew to see if it would look bad if he baby-sat for his grandson instead of joining his wife and daughter at the Million Mom March.</p>
        <p>People do like to like W., even when they don't like him. This allows the Texan to behave opportunistically, without seeming as smarmy as his rival. W. gets to toady to the right wing while proclaiming his moderation.</p>
        <p>How amazing that Mr. Gore can't simply body surf the rising economic tide. Writing about the demand for luxury goods, The Washington Post reports that orders for yacht charters are up 400 percent. There's a huge back order on Patek Philippe women's bracelet watches, selling for $6,250, and men's gold calendar watches, selling for $26,500.</p>
        <p>Yet even Bill Clinton can only muster this about his beloved protege: ''It's still more likely than not that he will win.''</p>
        <p>Former President George Bush told The Times's Frank Bruni on Friday that he thinks his son will prevail, not necessarily because of his charms, but for the same reason the father lost to Mr. Clinton. ''I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The clenched vice president should heed the classy ex-president: Americans enjoy change from time to time. Not moment to moment.</p>
