        <p>The Rev. Richard L. Lacy says he has spent the last 12 years waiting for the city to keep its word.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacey said that during a tour of Dubos Point, a wildlife habitat between Somerville Basin and Jamaica Bay, in Arverne, Queens, in 1988, Parks Department officials promised to clean and restore it and to make it a place where people, as well as animals, could exist. Officials even promised a nature trail, he said.</p>
        <p>But, local residents say, the wildlife sanctuary is little more than a dumping ground for discarded tires, construction debris and household waste. They also say the area is the primary breeding ground for the area's mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>For 10 years, the city chapter of the Audubon Society sporadically maintained Dubos Point, which is city-owned park land, on a volunteer basis.</p>
        <p>Sean Andrews, the executive director of the Audubon Society, said a lack of funds and of a full-time staff prevented the volunteer work from being adequate, and the society did not renew its agreement with the Parks Department to maintain the area last year. Residents say that cleanup work by the Parks Department, which took over the task this year, was ineffective.</p>
        <p>''It's worse now,'' said Mr. Lacey.</p>
        <p>''People are angry, and they have every right to be,'' said Jonathan Gaska, the district manager of Community Board 12. ''It isn't until recently that Parks has taken the bull by the horns here.''</p>
        <p>But Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, disagrees that his agency was ineffective in its work at the site.</p>
        <p>''We have been making efforts to clean it up,'' said Mr. Stern. ''There's a real physical problem here. Each time the tide ebbs and flows, it leaves trash that washes up from the bay. Even though there are no humans on it, the area is constantly being littered.''</p>
        <p>In response to residents' complaints and because of concern about  the West Nile virus, Mr. Stern said the department removed more than 80 tires and many truckloads of of debris along the Dubos Point shoreline in February.</p>
        <p>But workers disturbed some of the area's environmentally protected habitat, which resulted in a notice of violation from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>''This is a case of no good deed goes unpunished,'' Mr. Stern said, explaining that no more debris will be collected until the environmental issue is resolved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern, who was commissioner in 1988, said he was surprised to hear that residents were promised a nature trail and other amenities then.  ''No one ever told me that,'' he said. ''Normally, a wildlife sanctuary is not a shoreline park for local residents.''</p>
