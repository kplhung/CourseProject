        <p>WHEN Gurney's Inn emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy a year ago, ending five difficult years, 82-year-old Nick Monte led the family and senior employees in an impromptu celebration. The proud hotelier, who had always done things his own way, was already planning his next big move.</p>
        <p>This month Gurney's is announcing an $8 million renovation that has just been approved by the time-share co-op's board. The new look will recall the traditional New England seashore resort. ''It has kind of a retro, nostalgia feel,'' said Robert J. DiLeonardo, the Rhode Island designer commissioned by the Montes. ''You feel you're coming to a place where you'll be comfortable right away.''</p>
        <p>The renovation -- Mr. Monte suggests ''renaissance,'' the way a maitre d' might propose a delightfully assertive pinot grigio -- will focus on the lobby, opening up the dark check-in area with an ocean view. The project will also upgrade the driveway, reformat the dining rooms to provide more conference space and spruce up the residential rooms with new furniture and wallpaper.</p>
        <p>''Visitors will see the ocean the minute they walk in,'' Mr. Monte declared with pride. ''After all, that's why they're here -- for the ocean.'' In fact, visitors have always come to Gurney's for more than the waters.</p>
        <p>''Gurney's is undoubtably the best known Long Island resort,'' said David Lee, 72, former chairman and president of the Long Island Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''One big reason is Nick himself. When Nick likes you, he throws his arms around you like the Godfather and kind of takes you in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee remembers the effort it took to establish the Inn as Mr. Monte's kind of place. ''Casual as Montauk is, Nick wanted to preserve a little formality in the dining room,'' he said. ''He made sure his staff was well-trained. And he asked that gentlemen wear jackets. If you arrived without one, as I sometimes did, Nick would suggest that one of the many jackets he just happened to have available might fit you. And somehow it always did.''</p>
        <p>The Inn has changed with the times. Today it emphasizes the healthful benefits of a spa that specializes in salt-water therapies. Lectures by wellness gurus draw crowds. The facilities are marketed as a site for conferences and retreats. Last month, for the second year, MTV held its annual meeting at the resort, its on-air personalities spilling at sundown onto the streets of Montauk, where ice-cream eating tourists and surfboard-toting locals gaped in surprise.</p>
        <p>Other recent corporate clients include Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the Swedish Mission to the United Nations and Deutsche Bank. Next month, Hillary Rodham Clinton is due for a day. (Unlike many spas, Gurney's welcomes day visitors, including senatorial candidates.)</p>
        <p>Long a prime spot for weddings, Gurney's suffered a drop in its bridal business during the bankruptcy. But it has rebounded, and this year the Inn could play host to 45 weddings, according to Ingrid Lemme, the marketing director.</p>
        <p>The biggest change, though, has been the transition to a time-share operation.</p>
        <p>''It was a difficult conversion,'' said Paul Monte, 42, Nick Monte's nephew and an East End restaurant and pub owner who assumed the titles of president and general manager during the reorganization. (Nick kept the title Keeper of the Inn.)</p>
        <p>''New York State, which regulates the process, is resistant to the time-share concept,'' Paul Monte said. ''So we had to answer a lot of questions from the attorney general. We also had to get the word out quickly about our new structure. We invested between $18 million and $20 million in advertising and marketing.''</p>
        <p>The amount, Paul Monte reflected, represented about half the total amount spent on advertising and marketing since the family bought the Inn in 1956. While costly, the investment raised occupancy from about 65 percent to about 72 percent year round, and close to 100 percent during the summer.</p>
        <p>The improved occupancy rates helped lift the Inn out of bankruptcy, he said. It also helped that the family had become more cost conscious. ''We hired a comptroller and started paying much more attention to what we were spending,'' said Lola Monte, who shares the title Keeper of the Inn with Nick, her husband.</p>
        <p>Gurney's did not hold back on advertising, however. ''Mr. Monte believes you advertise in good times, and advertise even more when business falls off,'' Ms. Lemme said.</p>
        <p>Advertising indeed continued, including efforts aimed overseas. Gurney's is especially well known in Germany, due to several quirks of fate. In the 1950's one of Mr. Monte's first employees, a German refugee named Gisela Waterman, used her European connections to promote Gurney's in German magazines. The Inn also got a lucky break when a guest who stayed in the 1960's, the Swiss poet Max Frisch, wrote a book called ''Montauk'' that was set at the Inn. The book remains in print.</p>
        <p>''Every year, there's a stream of young people speaking German, wanting to see the places Frish wrote about,'' Ms. Lemme said.</p>
        <p>A far greater number, however, are drawn by the spa, an indoor seawater facility. As a young restaurateur in Brooklyn, Nick Monte took a daily two-mile walk to the St. George Hotel, where swam in the pool in water drawn from the East River. After he and his first wife vacationed at Gurney's in the late 1940's, they set their minds on purchasing the resort. An indoor seawater spa similar to St. George's would, they decided, turn the small inn into an international attraction.</p>
        <p>Maude Gurney was of a mind to sell, and did, for $200,000. The inn then consisted of two dozen rooms fronting the Atlantic. While tourism today is Montauk's main industry, in those days the region boasted only some inns and few other lodgings.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Gurney was a conservative lady,'' Mr. Monte recalled in an interview in his home, a mile from the Inn. ''There was no drinking, no loving, no nothing. I realized I had to start building my own crowd. But I didn't want to lose the old crowd before new people starting coming. I kept them for a while, but as things changed, they found somewhere else, I guess.''</p>
        <p>Many others found the Brooklyn newcomers a breath of fresh air. ''People in town seek them out,'' said Marilyn Behan, executive director of the Montauk Chamber of Commerce. ''We marry our children there, have Communion dinners and graduation dinners there, and they're always hospitable. They remember things like anniversary dates. They've brought the spa world to Montauk, but they've never grown too big for Montauk.''</p>
        <p>A firm believer in the healing properties of the ocean, Nick Monte drinks an ounce of seawater daily, a habit he considers restorative. Recently he directed an employee to bring a water sample to a local laboratory for testing. ''I'm convinced seawater is the healthiest thing you can put in your body,'' he exclaimed with passion. ''My next project is bottling this stuff and selling it.''</p>
        <p>Of course, in a sense that's what Gurney's has always done.</p>
