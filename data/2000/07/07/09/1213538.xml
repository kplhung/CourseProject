        <p>Melanie Anne Simpson, the daughter of Brenda L. Simpson and the Rev. Dane A. Simpson of Jonesboro, Ga., was married yesterday to Andrew Lawson Wright, a son of Dr. Gwendolyn Nowlan and Dr. Craig M. Wright, both of New Haven. Canon Petero R. N. Sabune performed the ceremony at St. James' Episcopal Church in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride, 25, is the advertising manager for the asset management division of Citigroup, the New York financial services company. She graduated cum laude from the University of Mississippi, where for a year she was the editor of The Daily Mississippian. Her father, a Baptist minister, was formerly associated with the Edgewater Baptist Church in New Orleans. Her mother is a senior financial services analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 26, is an associate at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, the New York law firm. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University, where for a year he was the president of The Harvard Crimson. He received his law degree from the University of Chicago. His mother is a professor of library science at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. His father is a professor of music at Yale there. The bridegroom is a stepson of Sherry L. Dominick and of Robert A. Nowlan Jr.</p>
        <p>The couple met in August 1995 at Kennedy Airport, as they were leaving for Poland and Israel on a two-week trip for college newspaper editors sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League.</p>
        <p>''Melanie and I made this instant connection as friends,'' Mr. Wright recalled. ''I had absolutely no intentions beyond that, although everyone else seemed to sense that there was something more going on.''</p>
        <p>After the trip, the two remained in touch, and the next year they began dating, albeit from a distance.</p>
        <p>''Our phone bills were outrageous,'' the bride said.</p>
        <p>In October 1998, Mr. Wright planned to propose during a vacation trip the couple were taking to Vancouver. But before they could board the airplane at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, the ring box he was carrying in his pocket set off the metal detector. The security guard required him to take out the box.</p>
        <p>By the time the two reached the gate, Mr. Wright, who figured that by now Ms. Simpson knew what was in the box (she didn't), decided he had to act. The bride recalled being stunned as the bridegroom knelt and proposed before the many onlookers at the gate.</p>
        <p>Although the couple had talked about marriage, she remembered having thought he wouldn't propose until Christmas at least, and more likely after his graduation from law school the following spring.</p>
        <p>''There's sort of a poetic symmetry to it, I suppose,'' Mr. Wright said, considering that the couple had also met in an airport. ''But it was completely unintentional.''</p>
