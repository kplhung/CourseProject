      <abstract>
        <p>C Webster Wheelock letter responds to July 3 article about pressure on sixth-grade students to prepare for college; foresees higher incidence of stress-related problems in midlife for sixth graders who are overly concerned about college admission</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We can make a prediction about the sixth graders who already worry about college admission (front page, July 3): There will be, as compared with their less motivated peers, a higher incidence of stress-related problems in midlife and more conservatism about the social-welfare programs of the future. But they will also have the satisfaction of finding and keeping high-paying work, and that of passing to their offspring the values of determination and discipline that made their success possible.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We can make a prediction about the sixth graders who already worry about college admission (front page, July 3): There will be, as compared with their less motivated peers, a higher incidence of stress-related problems in midlife and more conservatism about the social-welfare programs of the future. But they will also have the satisfaction of finding and keeping high-paying work, and that of passing to their offspring the values of determination and discipline that made their success possible.</p>
        <p>If these people are willing to accept the trade-off of greater stress for greater success, our society should not maintain a soft-headed attitude that would prevent their trying. We can no longer accept mediocrity as the price to be paid for our schoolchildren's comfortable self-regard, not if we want to survive global competition.</p>
