        <p>INVESTORS who thought they could lessen their risk by diversifying overseas found little solace last quarter in international equity funds, many of which underperformed their domestic counterparts.</p>
        <p>The funds fell by an average of 6.28 percent for the period, according to Morningstar Inc., compared with a decline of 2.91 percent for all stock funds in the United States.</p>
        <p>A big reason was the 180-degree reversal of fortune for once-hot technology stocks. Many of last year's stellar funds became this year's laggards by loading up on high-priced foreign Internet and telecommunications stocks that took a downturn during a highly volatile period. Plenty of domestic funds did the same, of course, but the problem was compounded for foreign funds by adverse currency movements, particularly the euro's slide, that further eroded their dollar-denominated returns.</p>
        <p>But a few international funds managed to beat the trend, mainly by resisting dot-com temptations and sticking with undervalued old-economy companies on the rebound. Among them were Pilgrim International Value and Longleaf Partners International, which invested primarily in middle- and large-cap stocks in Europe and Japan, and RS Contrarian, which invested heavily in energy stocks largely in Canada.</p>
        <p>''We're really looking through the trash that everyone else has thrown out, trying to find undervalued companies run by people with integrity,'' said Andrew McDermott, who helps run the Longleaf fund along with O. Mason Hawkins of Southeastern Asset Management in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott and Mr. Hawkins, along with Charles Brandes, lead manager of Pilgrim International and Andrew Pilara, a co-manager of RS Contrarian, recently shared some of their stock-picking and investment approaches for the quarter. They also discussed their market outlooks for the remainder of the year.</p>
        <p>No Nets, but Safety</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandes, 57, who runs Brandes Investment Partners of San Diego,  submanager for Pilgrim International, says countries and industry sectors do not matter when he chooses stocks for the $758 million fund. ''Our secret is to buy good companies at bargain prices, no matter where they happen to be,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That approach brought Pilgrim International a return of 7.46 percent in the second quarter and 28.23 percent for the last 12 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandes said he is a student of the Benjamin Graham-David Dodd value approach to investing, detailed in the 1930's: to buy stocks that trade at below-market ratios of price to earnings but that are poised to climb.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Brandes, that means holding very few technology shares, which account for just 1.8 percent of the fund's assets. Instead, the bulk of the portfolio last quarter was in financial services, consumer staples, durable goods and industrial cyclicals, mainly in Europe with smaller portions in Latin America, Japan and elsewhere on the Pacific Rim.</p>
        <p>The biggest contributors to his fund's performance, according to Mr. Brandes, included Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment maker; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan; and National Power, the British electric utility. All three had good cash flow, and their stock prices posted double-digit percentage gains in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Currency Risk, Canceled</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott, 31, and Mr. Hawkins, 52, echoed many of Mr. Brandes's views on value. The bargain-hunting style, out of fashion in 1999, helped the $300 million Longleaf International fund gain 10.11 percent for the quarter, second best among international stock funds, and 14.05 percent for the last 12 months. But the Longleaf fund mixes in some growth companies, too.</p>
        <p>''We don't think we can separate value from growth,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''We care more about what value will build'' in a company.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDermott added: ''We don't have a quarterly strategy, and we don't have an asset allocation strategy based on geography. We're strictly bottom-up.''</p>
        <p>The fund's currency-hedging strategy also helped. The managers match the expected foreign-currency earnings of their holdings with short positions in those currencies, cushioning the fund from exchange-rate fluctuations. ''It's one of the reasons our funds held up in the second quarter,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''We don't take foreign-currency risks.''</p>
        <p>It is also why the fund avoids investing in Latin America or other emerging markets, where most currencies are too volatile to hedge easily. The portfolio is concentrated instead in Europe and Japan, and focuses on services, financial stocks, retailers and industrial cyclicals.</p>
        <p>Among the fund's top performers, according to Mr. McDermott, were Diageo, the giant British food and spirits company; Safeway P.L.C., the British supermarket chain; and Sampo Insurance of Finland.</p>
        <p>Diageo, whose many brands include Burger King, Haagen-Dazs, Guinness and Johnnie Walker, ''was selling at the cheapest price in its history,'' Mr. McDermott noted.</p>
        <p>Back in Favor</p>
        <p>Mr. Pilara, 58, found a few low-priced gems last year for the $100 million RS Contrarian, run by Robertson Stephens of San Francisco,  and much of the payoff came during the last quarter. As energy costs have risen sharply in the United States in recent months, so have the fortunes of many oil and gas companies whose shares he accumulated.</p>
        <p>''What's bad for the consumer is good for us,'' said Mr. Pilara, who joined the fund's founder, Paul Stephens, two years ago when the fund was mired in losses. Since then, Mr. Pilara has helped revamp the fund's investment strategy by reducing its  heavy concentration in beaten-down industries like metals mining.</p>
        <p>Now, about 45 percent of assets are in energy, with the remainder scattered in basic materials, communications, industrial cyclicals, technology and elsewhere. Most of the holdings are in Canada and the United States, Mr. Pilara said.</p>
        <p>The fund suffered along with other contrarian funds in the glory years of the bull market, but it is starting to see daylight again, gaining 10.22 percent in the second quarter, the best of any international stock fund tracked by Morningstar. It gained 15.46 percent over the last year.</p>
        <p>Among its top performers last quarter, according to Mr. Pilara, were EOG Resources of Houston; Ivanhoe Energy of Bakersfield, Calif.; and Anderson Exploration and Encal Energy, both of Calgary, Alberta. All are involved in the production of natural gas, which has soared in price recently, tripling on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the past year. ''Everyone is talking about gasoline, but we think there's a bigger problem with natural gas,'' he said, referring to the sharp rise in its price.</p>
        <p>Though the energy stocks don't quite fit the fund's out-of-favor criteria, Mr. Pilara said he had no plans to sell them.</p>
        <p>''We are a contrarian fund,'' he said, ''and we're looking for some more straw hats in the winter.''</p>
