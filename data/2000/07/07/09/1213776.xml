        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES, by Moses Isegawa. (Knopf, $26.) This panoramic first novel about the stormy postcolonial history of Uganda covers 30 years of baleful activity as experienced by three generations of a single family.</p>
        <p>THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF: The Stories of Russell Banks. (HarperCollins, $27.50.) An outstanding regional realist's relentless anatomy, in 31 stories, of contemporary life, chiefly in bleak sections of the northeastern United States.</p>
        <p>BEE SEASON, by Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling bee champ.</p>
        <p>THE CHIEF: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, by David Nasaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) An absorbing, scholarly biography showing Hearst as a larger, more talented, more generous and less dangerous figure than looms (with the help of ''Citizen Kane'') in legend.</p>
        <p>FLUDD, by Hilary Mantel. (Owl/Holt, paper, $13.) First published in Britain in 1989, this novel of clerical life, suitably adjusted to modern times, concerns a Roman Catholic parish in a grim industrial town where things are so far gone that supernatural intervention is no surprise; the intervener, however, is no angel.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>LIVING TO TELL, by Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $24.) A whole family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this novel of wry, obsessive self-observation, beginning with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother in a drunken car crash.</p>
        <p>THE MARRIED MAN, by Edmund White. (Knopf, $25.) Mortality and forgiveness are still White's indispensable themes in this spare, resonant novel about a gay union that works both with and against the cliches of marriage.</p>
        <p>PLOWING THE DARK, by Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.</p>
        <p>PONTIUS PILATE, by Ann Wroe. (Random House, $26.95.) A historian reconstructs the ambience in which the prefect of Judea spent his days, developing an absorbing, if speculative, biography of the Roman who judged Jesus.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES, by Moses Isegawa. (Knopf, $26.) This panoramic first novel about the stormy postcolonial history of Uganda covers 30 years of baleful activity as experienced by three generations of a single family.</p>
        <p>THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF: The Stories of Russell Banks. (HarperCollins, $27.50.) An outstanding regional realist's relentless anatomy, in 31 stories, of contemporary life, chiefly in bleak sections of the northeastern United States.</p>
        <p>BEE SEASON, by Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling bee champ.</p>
        <p>THE CHIEF: The Life of William Randolph Hearst, by David Nasaw. (Houghton Mifflin, $35.) An absorbing, scholarly biography showing Hearst as a larger, more talented, more generous and less dangerous figure than looms (with the help of ''Citizen Kane'') in legend.</p>
        <p>FLUDD, by Hilary Mantel. (Owl/Holt, paper, $13.) First published in Britain in 1989, this novel of clerical life, suitably adjusted to modern times, concerns a Roman Catholic parish in a grim industrial town where things are so far gone that supernatural intervention is no surprise; the intervener, however, is no angel.</p>
        <p>JIM THE BOY, by Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.</p>
        <p>LIVING TO TELL, by Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $24.) A whole family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this novel of wry, obsessive self-observation, beginning with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother in a drunken car crash.</p>
        <p>THE MARRIED MAN, by Edmund White. (Knopf, $25.) Mortality and forgiveness are still White's indispensable themes in this spare, resonant novel about a gay union that works both with and against the cliches of marriage.</p>
        <p>PLOWING THE DARK, by Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.</p>
        <p>PONTIUS PILATE, by Ann Wroe. (Random House, $26.95.) A historian reconstructs the ambience in which the prefect of Judea spent his days, developing an absorbing, if speculative, biography of the Roman who judged Jesus.</p>
