        <p>One thing 13-year-old Zach Romash likes about summer is that his back isn't aching all the time. During the school year, when he carries more than 20 pounds of books and binders home in his backpack each day, he feels the pain.</p>

        <p>One thing 13-year-old Zach Romash likes about summer is that his back isn't aching all the time. During the school year, when he carries more than 20 pounds of books and binders home in his backpack each day, he feels the pain.</p>
        <p>''It's really heavy and your shoulders really ache,'' said the 100-pound student, who start eighth grade here in the fall. ''When you get home and take it off, it's a relief.''</p>
        <p>The problem usually occurs among middle school students who have not developed the physique to match the heft of their book bags.</p>
        <p>Now parents and administrators alike are trying to address the issue of those aching backs as textbooks get heavier and students often find themselves lugging a quarter of their weight or more.</p>
        <p>Some districts are providing second copies of books, while others are giving parents the option of buying extra copies for use at home. Still other schools are trying to grant more access to lockers during the day so that students are carrying fewer books through the halls.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Michael DiLillo, executive director of field sales for Follett Educational Services, which sells books, software and other materials to more than 100,000 schools nationwide, said that in the last year there has been an increase in the number of school districts inquiring about buying second sets of the used books.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming more and more prevalent,'' Mr. DiLillo said.</p>
        <p>Mel Katz, principal of the Glenfield Middle School in Montclair, which has about 700 students, said, ''I think this is an ongoing problem,'' adding that the administration had been working with parents and teacher to solve the backpack strain.</p>
        <p>''The students have also been working on solutions,'' Mr. Katz said. ''Many of the kids are now using small suitcases with wheels.''</p>
        <p>Leslie Turbeville, assistant principal of John Witherspoon Middle School in Princeton, which runs from grade six through eight, said: ''The books are heavy, there's no doubt about it. We have sixth-grade kids who are only 60 pounds. You can see they are leaning forward to walk. We are trying to be sensitive to this issue.''</p>
        <p>A few years ago, the school administrators there also ordered duplicate sets of certain books. In addition, Mr. Turbeville asked teachers to consider having students copy problems or questions from textbooks to avoid the strain.</p>
        <p>At Collingswood Middle School the principal, Alan Gansert, said he had also looked for ways to alleviate the problem. For instance, Mr. Gansert said that students were now allowed more access to their lockers, and teachers were encouraged to post projects and due dates in the teachers' room so they could space out projects and avoid having students hauling home several volumes of books each day.</p>
        <p>And no, it does not seem to be a case of, ''Why, when I was in school we'd carry home several volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica through 10 miles in the snow and  . . . ''</p>
        <p>To be sure, orthopedic surgeons plan to study the effects of the ubiquitous backpack on back pain and children's gaits this fall. Dr. William G. Mackenzie, a children's orthopedist at A. I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., will examine about  1,000 children during an 18-month period.</p>
        <p>''We don't think backpacks cause scoliosis,'' said Dr. Mackenzie. But he added that the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons was hearing more complaints of back pain from middle-school and high-school students.</p>
        <p>Nor do these appear to be iolated instances. At Benjamin Franklin Middle School in Teaneck, several students have brought notes from doctors to school about experiencing back pain, and the school has purchased duplicate books for them to keep at home, said the principal, Robert Onorato.</p>
        <p>Not only are books getting larger, Mr. Onorato said, but students are carrying large notebooks and organizers that weigh down the packs. And students in a hurry -- which is not uncommon -- often throw everything into their backpacks, and take more home than they need, he said. ''We're trying to teach them some organization,'' Mr. Onorato said.</p>
        <p>During the winter and again this summer, parents of students at Haddonfield Middle School received notices advising them that they could buy used textbooks for their homes, with prices ranging from $7.65 for a spelling book to $43.56 for the eighth-grade social studies book.</p>
        <p>In February, the Parent Teacher Association in Haddonfield, which organized the program with the principal, Michael Klaszky, ordered 75 books for 30 families. This summer, 219 books were ordered for 75 families, and more orders will be taken in the fall.</p>
        <p>''Some people said I'm buying them so I don't have to run to school every night when my kids forget their books,'' said Kathy Widerman of the P.T.A., who collected the book orders.</p>
        <p>Mimi Yurkow, a mother of a Haddonfield Middle School student who walks almost a mile to school, said she planned to order the books. Some days, Mrs. Yurkow said, she would drive to school to pick up the backpack from her son and have him walk home for the execise.</p>
        <p>''When they drop the pack it falls with this resounding thud,'' she said. ''These kids are small and they're carrying 20 pounds of books. It has been an issue here.''</p>
        <p>In any event, technology may soon unburden America's youth, administrators say, as more families get home computers.</p>
        <p>''If we can get a computer in every home, a lot of assignments can be done on the Internet,'' said Mr. Gansert.</p>
        <p>In an age when software is available to dissect frogs on the computer, it is likely that more and more work will be done on line, meaning fewer books will have to be dragged home.</p>
        <p>''When I taught in 1972, I was the only teacher with a calculator and it cost $70,'' he said. ''Now, it's $9.''</p>
