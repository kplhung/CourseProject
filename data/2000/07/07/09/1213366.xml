        <p>Ask a baseball pitcher why so many home runs are hit these days and you will hear an impassioned speech from a member of an oppressed minority. You will hear how umpires are calling a fist-size strike zone (They're sticking it to us!), architects are designing ballparks that couldn't hold a Crackerjack box (It's a travesty!), the mounds are lower (They won't give us any edge!) and, of course, the baseball is different -- smoother, denser, more slippery, improperly cared for by umpires who should be more diligent about rubbing them with Delaware River mud (We're throwing golf balls out there!).</p>
        <p>Ask an infielder, an outfielder or any player except a pitcher about the inordinate increase in home runs and a royal smirk often precedes the response. (The answers are pretty obvious, aren't they?) You are informed the hitters are stronger than they used to be (That's a weight belt hanging in my locker, and it protects against hernias -- you didn't know that, did you?), train daily (I am a machine!) and capitalize on modern technology (We study videotape between at-bats and recognize the weaknesses in all pitchers).</p>
        <p>These conflicting views on the home run explosion underscore the hard, immutable boundary that exists between the two sides. It cuts deeper than you think. Hitters and pitchers on opposing teams are, of course, natural adversaries. But even among players on the same club, there is a breach that goes mostly unnoticed by the outside world. The social dynamic of all teams breaks down along certain lines -- Christian players pray before games, Latinos are drawn together by a common language, on the Yankees all the guys from Texas are friends -- but no division is more powerful than the one between pitchers and everybody else. Simply put, they are members of different tribes, and their separate allegiances are reflected in how they think, how they work, how they spend their free time and, ultimately, how they play the game.</p>
        <p>The players themselves, all of them, acknowledge the split, and offer pop-psychological theories. ''It's the difference between left-brained and right-brained people,'' says Phil Garner, a former infielder who now manages the Detroit Tigers. ''Pitchers are more esoteric, thinkers, artsy-craftsy type guys -- they're the sculptors, we're the hammer-and-nail guys.'' Tom Glavine, the Atlanta pitcher, says, through a jesting smile, that hitters ''are intimidated by our intelligence and our perspective on the game.''</p>
        <p>In the best of circumstances, these differences are fodder for clubhouse gags, a running dogs-versus-cats debate. But they can be the source of real conflict, particularly in an era when pitchers, even good ones, are getting pounded and their roles are becoming ever more compartmentalized. Increasingly, it's a hitter's game, not just on the field but off.</p>
        <p>The Good Life:  Why Pitchers Are Better Golfers</p>
        <p>Pitchers and hitters start out the same. In Little League and right on through college, the best players usually pitch and then play shortstop when they're not on the mound. It's not really until the minor leagues that the responsibilities of pitchers and everybody else diverge -- position players must take the field every day and push through the grueling season. Relievers are segregated in the bullpen, getting the call when needed, and the starters grow accustomed to playing only one out of five games, at most. The rhythms of the jobs lead to entirely different lifestyles. Take a head count in the hotel bar at last call, and chances are the majority of ballplayers will be pitchers. The Toronto left-hander (and ex-Yankee) David Wells takes full advantage of his schedule and makes no secret of the fact that he likes to go drinking and stay out late. His old manager with Detroit, Sparky Anderson, had a standing arrangement with Wells; out of every five days, the left-hander owed the team two -- the day he was pitching and the one before. Other than that, Wells was free to pursue his own passions. No manager would ever allow a second baseman or a catcher to get away with this.</p>
        <p>Merv Rettenmund had a long career as an outfielder, including some years with the Orioles, before becoming a hitting coach. ''We had pitchers in Baltimore -- I'm not going to name them -- but let's just say that the first couple of days after they pitched, they were under the weather,'' Rettenmund says. ''And a position player can't be like that. You have to grind it, day in and day out.''</p>
        <p>When Davey Johnson managed the Mets in the late 1980's, he was particularly sensitive to the influence that pitchers had on their other teammates. Johnson would take Howard Johnson and Lenny Dykstra aside and suggest that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to go out after games with Ron Darling or Bob Ojeda. It's a standing joke in baseball circles that position players cannot keep up with pitchers. Garner says that in his playing days with Pittsburgh, he sometimes went to dinner after night games with the pitchers Don Robinson and Jim Rooker, but then inevitably had to leave them behind. ''I had to shut it down,'' Garner says. ''They didn't have to. They could stay out and do what they wanted to. Pitchers can afford to push it a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the bar scene isn't exactly what it used to be. Nowadays, some pitchers turn in early -- so they can make their tee times. On any given club, it's a sure bet that the best golfers are pitchers. While everyday players think of life on the road almost entirely in terms of airports, hotels and stadiums, many pitchers can recite a list of the best golf courses in every big-league city. Atlanta's famed starting rotation, anchored by Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, is renowned for its obsession with golf. They play all season long -- the only good excuse for missing it is if you have to pitch that day. On their days off, a lot of starting pitchers have to show up only 90 minutes before a game, and they're usually the first to duck out after the game.</p>
        <p>Even when they're in the clubhouse together, position players and pitchers tend to stick to their own kind. Walk through the deep blue door of the Yankees' clubhouse and you will see five short rows of lockers. To your right, the pitcher David Cone sits at the end of one of those rows, which is occupied almost entirely by pitchers; only the center fielder Bernie Williams is in their midst. On the other side, to your far left, the shortstop Derek Jeter's locker sits in a row of a half-dozen that include those of two outfielders, a catcher, a third baseman and one pitcher, Ramiro Mendoza. It just so happens that the two interlopers, Williams and Mendoza, are the most introverted members of the team. And the bridge game that's often going on -- it's a non-pitchers' affair. Nobody enforces this clubhouse social order; it just seems to occur naturally.</p>
        <p>Because of their looser schedule, pitchers are less affected by the day-to-day conformity of the clubhouse and can get away more easily with strange, even freakish behavior. Take, for example, Fritz Peterson and Mike Kekich, who were Yankee teammates back in 1973. In one of the more memorable off-the-field scandals of baseball history, Peterson and Kekich essentially swapped their lives -- wives, kids, dogs, the works. It's no coincidence that the first tell-all books that pierced the veil of clubhouse confidentiality -- Jim Brosnan's ''Long Season'' and Jim Bouton's ''Ball Four'' -- were written by pitchers. They simply had more time to observe and reflect on their teammates and take notes. Even the behavior of a guy like John Rocker can be understood, partly, in light of his role as a relief pitcher; his hyper antics wouldn't be possible if he were a position player. He wouldn't be able to charge onto the field and rile the crowd if he actually had to play all nine innings. And the fact that he spends most of the game marooned out in the bullpen could only have heightened his sense of isolation in the aftermath of his disastrous Sports Illustrated interview.</p>
        <p>The Blame Game:  Can't Somebody Here Throw a Strike?</p>
        <p>When they take the field together, pitchers and the rest of their teammates bury their differences. Or at least they try to. Inevitably, there is second-guessing. Glavine says he will see a teammate swing at and miss a hittable pitch -- the type of pitch Glavine couldn't get away with -- and he will wonder, for an instant, ''Why couldn't he hit that?'' Similarly, Paul O'Neill, standing in right field, gets impatient when he watches a pitcher struggle with his control. ''It looks so easy from out there,'' O'Neill says. ''That's the first thing they tell you in Little League -- everything starts with throwing the ball over the plate.''</p>
        <p>More intense conflict arises when the opposing pitcher hits a batter or aggressively throws inside. With a few notable exceptions, like Pedro Martinez of the Red Sox, pitchers have lost the battle for the inside half of the strike zone. Hitters are more sensitive than ever about being brushed back or struck by a pitch. There is a very simple code that governs how a pitcher is supposed to react when one of his own teammates is hit -- he is supposed to drill one of the other team's hitters with a fastball aimed at the backside. If a pitcher fails to retaliate, clubhouse friction is inevitable. Two years ago, in a game against Seattle, Yankee hitters were repeatedly hit or brushed back, and the left-hander Andy Pettitte didn't respond. There was so much tension that a team meeting was called the next day. According to David Cone, the most divisive issue between pitchers and hitters is the intimidation factor. ''If there's no retaliation or sense of protection, or disagreement about what needs to be done, that's a major problem.''</p>
        <p>The flip side of this is that hitters are infuriated when one of their own pitchers instigates a bean-ball war purely out of personal frustration. While with the Baltimore Orioles two years ago, Armando Benitez allowed a pivotal home run against the Yankees and then on the very next pitch drilled Tino Martinez. A nasty brawl ensued, which was not surprising. What was surprising was that while blows were being exchanged, some Orioles players were actually apologizing to the Yankees on the field about what Benitez had done.</p>
        <p>Whose Team Is It Anyway?  Why Catchers End Up on Top</p>
        <p>On the day they're scheduled to start, pitchers get a lot of leeway from their teammates. Among other privileges, they often get to pick the clubhouse music, which some take to extremes; Wells, for one, blasted Metallica in the Yankees' clubhouse, placing the speakers on the chair in front of his locker. Teammates tolerate the noise, in recognition of the fact that on his day, the starting pitcher is the most important player on the team.</p>
        <p>This selfishness, however, is not supposed to spill over onto the field. Earlier in his career, the Dodgers' Kevin Brown reacted furiously whenever something went wrong, stomping around the mound if an infielder misplayed a grounder or if he allowed a cheap hit. After a poor outing, he'd often tear up the clubhouse. As dominant as Brown could be on the mound -- and former teammates in Texas and Baltimore were awed by his talent -- many couldn't stand playing with him, believing he was embarrassing them with his antics, that he was violating an unwritten code by openly demonstrating his unhappiness over their performance.</p>
        <p>Because their roles are inherently part time, pitchers are rarely named captain, or assume much of a leadership position. A team leader ''has to be a guy who is in the heat every day,'' says Rettenmund. ''He's one of the guys who's going to fail a lot and help everybody else deal with that. If you have a pitcher who's a team leader, it's not a healthy situation.''</p>
        <p>Even Cone, who along with Glavine and Maddux is one of the few pitchers with the authority to speak for the team, agrees: ''Position players are better suited to be a captain. It's got to be someone who's in there every day.''</p>
        <p>Most pitchers, in fact, have to be very careful about what they say. Early in 1996, when the Orioles were playing poorly, the pitcher Mike Mussina sharply criticized the team's performance. The next day, Ripken beckoned Mussina to shortstop during batting practice and, as Ripken practiced fielding grounders, he suggested it was a bad idea for Mussina to speak in this way for two reasons -- team conflicts should be kept private, and Mussina is not a position player. Pitchers are on-field leaders when they pitch, controlling all that goes on; when they don't pitch, which is most of the time, they are mere cheerleaders.</p>
        <p>For these reasons, few pitchers graduate into the managerial ranks. The conventional wisdom is that ex-pitchers will have trouble gaining the respect of their everyday players. A handful are successful: Larry Dierker has managed the Houston Astros to division titles the last three years. More typical is the case of the former pitcher Phil Regan, who lasted just one year as the Orioles' manager, in 1995. When he ripped them in team meetings, some veterans used to flash double-L finger signs to each other: Little League.</p>
        <p>When ex-hitters become managers, some, like Lou Piniella of Seattle, never develop an understanding for pitchers. Piniella has been able to channel the manic competitiveness of his playing days into the dugout, barking at umpires, screaming at his coaches, demanding accountability for mistakes and sometimes just plain bullying his players. Hitters like Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez have responded to his intensity. Pitchers have not. Piniella ''is the manager who hates pitchers,'' says Jeff Nelson, a Yankees reliever who used to pitch for Seattle. ''It's not hard to understand why that is.''</p>
        <p>Piniella was a great hitter for 18 seasons; his professional responsibility was to loathe pitchers. How could he just shut that off?</p>
        <p>''He just doesn't have patience,'' Nelson says. ''He doesn't understand pitchers. He tells you, 'Throw the ball over the plate.' You feel like saying: 'Is that what I'm supposed to do? I didn't know that. I thought I was supposed to come out here and walk everyone.' ''</p>
        <p>Ted Williams, the Hall of Fame slugger, briefly managed the Washington Senators but was never much of a success, in part because he just couldn't handle a pitching staff. His theory was that his pitchers should throw sliders, because that was the pitch that gave him the most trouble when he was a player. So the Senators unloaded one of their best starters, Joe Coleman, because he didn't throw sliders, and Coleman went on to have several good seasons for Detroit. As a manager, Pete Rose had similar problems relating to pitchers, although at least he knew enough not to meddle too much. When Jim Kaat was hired as the pitching coach for the Cincinnati Reds, Rose was blunt, Kaat recalls: ''He told me: 'I don't know anything about pitching. I know about hitting. You take care of the pitching.' ''</p>
        <p>The gulf between pitchers and position players is part of the reason so many managers are ex-catchers -- they can deal with both sides. They are everyday players, but they are heavily invested in the fate of the pitchers. They can tolerate their idiosyncrasies. Over the last four years, just five managers have taken their teams to the World Series; four of them were catchers at least part of their careers: Joe Torre, Bobby Cox of Atlanta, Bruce Bochy of San Diego and Jim Leyland of Florida. ''Catchers have to have empathy for pitchers,'' Cone says. ''They have no choice.''</p>
        <p>Nothing to Lose:  A Pitcher Declares War</p>
        <p>Doug Brocail is not your ordinary pitcher. The Tigers right-hander is an elephantine presence in the clubhouse, 6-foot-5 and 230 pounds, a thicket of brown hair surrounding his mouth, in the style of Civil War officers. Brocail practices his craft with a linebacker's intensity, screaming into his glove when he makes a mistake, stamping his cleats on the mound. Brocail has had some good seasons and some bad seasons, but with each passing year, he and his fellow pitchers are losing ground in their fight against hitters.</p>
        <p>Brocail confesses, with a smile, to impure thoughts when teammates go through offensive droughts. ''You sit there and think, 'Put me in there, I can hit.' ''And Brocail especially does not like it when the sacrosanct turf of pitchers is trespassed by anyone else, even the team's catchers. During pregame pitchers' meetings, Brocail will look over at the catcher Brad Ausmus and wonder silently: What is he doing here? Shouldn't he be with the hitters?</p>
        <p>Sitting in the Tigers' clubhouse, Brocail reaches into a dark corner of his locker and pulls out his protective cup, which is wrapped with white medical tape. Brocail used red and black markers to draw the face of a warrior on the tape. Above the warrior's face, Brocail wrote a two-word phrase. The second word is HITTERS. The first word is profane. ''See?'' Brocail said. ''That's just the way it is.''</p>
