        <p>GENERATIONS of New Jerseyans shopped the Bamberger's store at the corner of Market and Halsey Streets in Newark for clothing, accessories and household goods. The throngs of shoppers have long since departed for the suburbs but the store, later named Macy's and closed in 1992, has gained an unexpected new life.</p>
        <p>Rows of computers and telecommunications equipment now fill the floors that once displayed women's dresses and men's suits. The building has been transformed into a high-technology center, the physical repository of the machines that support the rapid growth of the Internet.</p>
        <p>It is just one example of how old industrial and retail properties, formerly considered unrentable white elephants, have suddenly become highly attractive to Web hosting and communications companies who need sites to expand -- and need them now.</p>
        <p>The old buildings have what the Internet companies need: sturdy floors and high ceilings to accommodate heavy, delicate equipment; abundant electrical power to keep the machines humming and easy access to the optical-fiber cables that are the highways of the Internet. In the case of the old industrial buildings, proximity to the high-volume fiber cables has come because the cables have been installed along established railroad lines.</p>
        <p>As a result of this newfound desirability of certain types of industrial buildings, old factories in Jersey City, a sprawling and underutilized marine terminal and an old tire factory in Brooklyn, and various locations in New Jersey's Meadowlands are all being promoted as technology centers.</p>
        <p>Even buildings that were at the heart of old telecommunications technology, such as AT&amp;T's onetime manual switching center at 32 Avenue of the Americas, at Walker Street, are  being adapted to new technology. The building has been purchased by the Rudin family, which is adapting it for use by companies like MCI WorldCom and Qwest.</p>
        <p>While a new generation of equipment will be installed upstairs at the old switching center, the landmarked lobby will retain the 1932 murals and the declaration that ''Telephone wires and radio unite to make neighbors of nations.''</p>
        <p>What is happening in the New York area is being replicated around the country and around the world. Everything is driven by time because new-economy companies believe that the ones who grab market share first will dominate their sectors.</p>
        <p>''Telecommunications and the Internet are closely related, they go hand in hand,'' said Goodwin Gaw, the chairman of Global Gateway, a company that is building a network of servers and telecommunications equipment in the western United States and Asia. ''Our customers like to be there before the wave.''</p>
        <p>Global Gateway is one of two companies being backed by $1.25 billion from Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds to build a global Internet communications network. The other is MetroNexis, which is responsible for the eastern United States and Europe. MetroNexis recently agreed to purchase the 1.1-million-square-foot former American Can factory at 50 Dey Street in Jersey City.</p>
        <p>For companies building the networks of computers, cable and software that undergirds the Internet, ''speed to market is the name of the game, and the space has to be available now,'' said Mark A. Teitelbaum, a partner in Argent Ventures, a New York real estate investment company. ''Anything that will not be ready for 18 months is a non-starter.''</p>
        <p>Argent has been acquiring property, including buildings in Weehawken and Jersey City and an old shopping mall in Miami, all for use as technology centers for Internet companies. ''We have acquired between 6 and 7 million square feet of property in the last 12 months,'' said Andrew S. Penson, another Argent partner. ''But that is like 10 years in Internet time.''</p>
        <p>He said that when Argent acquired the long-empty 300,000-square-foot building at 300 Boulevard East in Weehawken, Exodus Communications agreed to lease 230,000 square feet even before the purchase had closed. When Argent acquired the old Muller Noodle factory at 180 Baldwin Street in Jersey City, all 300,000 square feet were leased by AboveNet Communications, an affiliate of Metromedia Fiber Network, within two months of closing.</p>
        <p>Now Argent is waiting for a self-storage tenant to move out of the adjacent 80,000-square-foot building at 190 Baldwin so that it can move in technology tenants, Mr. Penson said. A little more than a year ago, previous owners of 190 Baldwin were trying to market the property to printers being forced out of Manhattan by rising rents. The possibility of attracting telecommunications or Internet-based tenants was not part of the discussion.</p>
        <p>THE million-square-foot Omni Mall on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami had one particularly significant advantage, Mr. Penson said. It was empty. He said the site could be a gateway to planned underwater communications links to Central and South America.</p>
        <p>The increase in marketability of older buildings suitable for use by Internet infrastructure companies has come suddenly.  ''Nobody knew anything about this until about a year ago,'' said John Peters, a former broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield who now runs his own company, Technology Real Estate. ''Now it is the 'in' thing for everybody.''</p>
        <p>Real estate executives said the scramble for growth by telecommunications and Internet-related companies made them relatively unconcerned about the cost of space. A good example, said Mr. Peters, is the old Port Authority inland warehouse at 111 Eighth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, he said, the owner, Taconic Investment Partners, was happy to sign leases in the mid $20's per square foot annually. The most recent lease, to Broadlink Communications, was at $55 a square foot, he said.</p>
        <p>''Telecommunications has become the most profitable sector in real estate,'' said Sean Brady, a broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''There are buildings in Jersey City that were bought for $5 a square foot that are renting space for $30 a square foot'' annually. He said there is scarcely an industrial building in Jersey City, even such unlikely candidates as two abandoned former cold storage warehouses, that have not been studied as a possible data center and telecommunications locations.</p>
        <p>For high-technology companies, which make their money transmitting and processing information, the cost of the real estate they occupy is not much more than a decimal point in their financial calculations. According to a recent report by the Lehman Brothers investment company, Internet hosting companies average $3,000 a square foot in annual revenues.</p>
        <p>The high-technology boom, ironically, is rehabilitating buildings that had been dismissed as obsolete, because of their size, ceiling height or amount of room for parking. But a facility that might be obsolete for warehousing and distribution could work well for Web hosting and telecommunications.</p>
        <p>''We have old buildings that are coming back to life,'' said Richard Marchisio, managing director of Grubb &amp; Ellis of New Jersey. ''This is a whole new sector of real estate that did not exist previously.''</p>
        <p>An established infrastructure, particularly railroad lines, is helping old, previously industrialized areas of the region. The reason is that many of the telecommunications companies have used railroad rights of way  to install fiber cables.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps the most important requirement for a telecom hotel is a nearby fiber-optic network,'' Grubb &amp; Ellis said in a recent market report. ''This is the gold beneath the streets, the lifeline for an obsolete industrial building. Much of the fiber-optic networks run along existing rail rights of way in urban areas.''</p>
        <p>In Newark, it noted, the old Bamberger's-Macy's building is near fiber lines, making it attractive to such companies as Qwest Communications, MCI WorldCom and Level 3 Communications.</p>
        <p>The success of that location has prompted some brokers, and some owners and prospective tenants, to look at the old, and long abandoned, retail buildings that line Broad Street, once Newark's prime shopping location. But if the buildings, which include the old Hahne's and S. Klein stores, are to be converted into technology centers, the change may run afoul of the city's efforts to revive the area as a SoHo-like village of  residences, shops and restaurants.</p>
        <p>There is little on the outside of the Bamberger's building to indicate that there is something approaching $1 billion worth of equipment inside. The tenants like that just fine because the last thing they want is to attract attention to themselves and their delicate equipment and vulnerable fiber links.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the building looks abandoned, except for some stores on the ground level and an underground parking operation.</p>
        <p>If the Hahne's or S. Klein stores were to be occupied by Internet and telecommunications companies, they would look abandoned as well. As such they could be an eyesore in an area the city wants to see redeveloped in conjunction with its sparkling new Performing Arts Center, which is on the other side of Military Park from the old stores.</p>
        <p>The New Newark Foundation owns or controls 2 million square feet of space in an eight-block area north of Broad Street, which is wired with fiber. The foundation is charged with developing a plan that will draw people to an area that is largely unpopulated outside business hours.</p>
        <p>But James Schmidt, the executive director of the foundation, said that technology companies have been inquiring about taking space in the old stores, which have been closed and boarded up since the mid-1980's. ''We have had expressions of interest from computer-related companies and telcos for the Hahne's and S. Klein buildings as well as inquiries for offices for dot-com people interested in moving here from New York and Jersey City,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the current plan is to convert the Hahne's store into residences, although he conceded that the building's 80,000-square-foot floors raised questions whether there would be enough light and air for the interior spaces. ''The most desirable outcome for the Hahne's building would be residential,'' he said, ''because it would provide 24-hour activity and more street life.''</p>
        <p>He said the foundation would be soliciting bids for the redevelopment of the buildings within a few weeks to determine whether expressions of interest are going to be backed by financial commitments.</p>
        <p>Bush Terminal in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn is a 5-million-square-foot complex of buildings that have sat underutilized on the waterfront since the 1960's, when containerized ocean shipping replaced labor-intensive methods of loading and unloading ships.</p>
        <p>But the sturdy old buildings that date to the early part of the 20th century are capable of supporting heavy loads, have high ceilings and have ample room for the powerful air-conditioning systems that Internet and telecommunications companies require.</p>
        <p>In addition, there is space nearby to place the diesel-powered electrical generators that these companies insist on as insurance against what they see as an increasingly unreliable power supply. There is below-ground space available to store fuel to power the diesel motors in quantities intended to keep the place running for three days without an outside utility. The streets between the buildings were long ago decommissioned by the city, so cables can be installed without seeking official permission, and seven-foot-high tunnels further connect the 12 buildings in the complex.</p>
        <p>Bush Terminal was also called Industry City because it was one of the first industrial parks in the nation. Industry has gone elsewhere, but the current owner, a private partnership named Industry City Associates, and the brokers who represent them are trying to convert it to a technology campus. This includes cutting vertical shafts called risers in the buildings, so that each tenant will have multiple connections to power and telecommunications cables.</p>
        <p>The city has assisted the transformation process by designating the area as a technology zone similar to the Plug 'n' Go program that attracted dot-com and other computer-based companies to lower Manhattan. The six-story, 100,000-square-foot building at 269 37th Street is being developed as the Brooklyn Information Technology Center -- pronounced ''Bit-sy.''</p>
        <p>Fledgling companies will be able starting Sept. 1 to rent prebuilt space that is wired for fiber-optic connections to each desk. Richard T. Kennedy, a senior director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, said a new lobby and elevators were being added to the structure, which now has only manually operated freight elevators. Annual rents, at $19 a square foot plus electricity, are way below the level commanded in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''This is the people building,'' said Mr. Kennedy, who added that the center will have affiliations with local educational institutions such as Polytechnic University and the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Two other buildings in the complex will largely be devoted to electronic machinery. One early tenant is WinStar Wireless, which is said to be the first Web-hosting company to locate in the city outside Manhattan. The company signed a lease for 80,620 square feet in Telecom Center I, in part to take advantage of the 12-story building's direct, line-of-sight connection to lower Manhattan and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Another tenant is World Link, which is in the process of installing switching equipment in the building.</p>
        <p>The decision to start converting Bush Terminal to a telecommunications center was made last year after observing the growth of the industry in Manhattan, said  Bruce B. Federman, a partner in Industry City Associates.</p>
        <p>''We decided to get into the telecom game in 1999 after watching it become very successful in Manhattan, and started wondering where it would land in the outer boroughs and New Jersey,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the terminal is near two fiber lines, making it possible to position the buildings as a location for high-technology companies.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER Brooklyn entrant into the tech-center business is the 750,000-square-foot factory building at 470 Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights. The building is vacant and is undergoing a $72 million redevelopment to erase its industrial past and to wire it for the future, said Gary Kamenetsky, a broker with Insignia/ ESG, a real estate services company based in New York.</p>
        <p>It is being developed by the Carlyle Group, which Mr. Kamenetsky described as a $14 billion investment fund based in Washington.</p>
        <p>He said the building is near the tracks of the Long Island Rail Road and a Bell Atlantic central office, giving it access to fiber-optic lines, and will be wired for electric power to provide 100 watts per square foot, compared with 4 or 5 watts a square foot in the typical office building. He said that the conversion work was under way and that the building would be ready for tenants on Sept. 1.</p>
        <p>The building at 32 Avenue of the Americas was never a factory, but its floors have ceiling heights ranging from 14 to 19 feet. In the days before air-conditioning, the volume was needed to circulate air past the more than 5,000 people who worked there making connections for long-distance calls, said John J. Gilbert, executive vice president of Rudin Management.</p>
        <p>''This building was the original telco hotel,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''In the 40's and 50's, if you made a call from Omaha, Neb., to Atlanta, Ga., it came through this building. There were 3,000 circuits connecting 360 cities.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's Long Lines division once occupied most of the structure, but the restructured company had no future need for all 1.2 million square feet. The company has consolidated into 400,000 square feet on the lower floors, and sold the building to Rudin last December.</p>
        <p>Rudin is rebuilding the remaining space to accommodate the new telco tenants, including the powerful air-conditioning systems they require and the dry fire-suppression systems needed to protect expensive equipment. Backup generators are being installed on building setbacks and on the 15th floor, which has been set aside as a mechanical floor. Two 150-foot towers are being installed on the roof to permit wireless communications.</p>
        <p>The building is being designed so that each tenant has a mechanical condominium. ''Each tenant has their own generators and fuel tank and controls,'' Mr. Gilbert said. ''They do not have to rely on shared building systems.''</p>
