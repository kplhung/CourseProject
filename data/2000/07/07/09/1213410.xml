        <p>SKELETONS!'' takes a lighthearted approach.</p>
        <p>In the exhibition, at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich through Oct. 29, there are skeletons that are simply Halloween scary as well as ones that are stunning ivory-colored lacy frameworks set against a charcoal background.</p>
        <p>Beauty aside, the focus of the show is on support structures crafted on ingenious architectural and engineering principles. Skeleton design is shown to have adapted to ways of life in the animal kingdom, to serve purposes of protection and movement from place to place as well as support. And they create clues to life on earth today as well as millions of years ago.</p>
        <p>More than 100 animal and human skeletons are displayed, ''borrowed from the museum's wonderful collection which sits in storage most of the time,'' said Lisette Henrey, the museum's associate curator of education, adding that ''the idea for an exhibition has been floating around for a while.''</p>
        <p>Not all of those showcased are the same: Vertebrates have bony internal skeletons known as endoskeletons (inside the body). Humans are among those with a spine and four legs.</p>
        <p>Other animals, like mollusks and arthropods with shells around them, animals with many jointed legs including lobsters, spiders and other creepy crawlers have exoskeletons. (Their outside protection is also their skeleton.) The exhibition, which is divided into three sections, places an emphasis on adaptation. Support, movement and protection all ''apply to endoskeletons and exoskeletons,'' Ms. Henrey said. ''They just do it in different ways.''</p>
        <p>Viewers are invited to take a close look at skeletons and their bones. Humans have about 200 bones held together at joints, in essence the framework that supports the body and creates its shape. The addition of muscles, connected by tendons, creates flexible motors that move the skeleton into action.</p>
        <p>A tongue-in-cheek centerpiece called ''The Bones Family at Home'' features a plexiglass-enclosed house with two human skeletons. One is shown riding an exercise bicycle while watching television (conveying the need to exercise to maintain a healthy skeleton).</p>
        <p>''If you don't exercise, you lose bone mass,'' Ms. Henrey said. The other, older, skeleton, with osteoporosis, has had a hip and knee surgically replaced with titanium and plastic implants. A series of X-rays from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx shows the repair and growth of bones after a break.</p>
        <p>Although all vertebrate skeletons are composed of a head, spinal cord and four limbs, variations exist.</p>
        <p>''Animals that fly have wings in place of front legs,'' Ms. Henrey said. ''And animals that swim have paddle-shaped limbs. A sloth, which eats leaves from trees, has hooked claws like a clothes hanger to latch onto branches, and snakes, whose ancestors had them, have no legs, but instead an extremely long, flexible backbone for sinuous slithering.''</p>
        <p>Skulls, too, have adapted for different ways of eating, for animals that are predators and those that are prey. Animals that hunt, like a mountain lion, have eyes that face front, but the bison, a grazing animal, has eyes on each side, for a much wider field of vision. Lions and sharks have sharp canine teeth for grabbing prey in flight. But a warthog has flat teeth for grinding tough plants. And some vertebrates with long, light, fast-moving legs (like the fox, mouse deer, jackrabbit and ostrich), are specialists in speed to escape predators -- or to catch up with a potential meal.</p>
        <p>A final stop reveals a cast of the skeleton Lucy, the first pre-human ancestor to walk on two feet. She was discovered in 1974 by the paleontologist Donald Johanson in Ethiopia, where she lived more than three million years ago. ''Skeletons are an introduction to our body,'' Ms. Henrey said. ''They tell us a lot about how we function and about the past. What's left behind and fossilized is the skeleton. It's our window into the past.''</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum of Arts and Science, 1 Museum Drive in Greenwich, is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday, 1 to 5 p.m. The number to call for more information is (203) 869-0376.</p>
