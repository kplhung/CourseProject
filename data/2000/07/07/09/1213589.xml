        <p>Plans under way for two residential towers designed by the architect Richard Meier have so upset Greenwich Village residents that a move is afoot to extend the local historic district to the Hudson River to prevent further such developments.</p>
        <p>The proposal seeks to create an expanded district covering about 300 buildings between Canal and 14th Streets on a stretch of waterfront. Although the plan dates to 1986, the announcement last month that Mr. Meier, who developed the Westbeth artists' complex in the 1960's, was returning to the area has created a sense of urgency among community groups.</p>
        <p>Ground was broken for the towers several weeks ago, and developers are eyeing other sites along this section of waterfront. The towers, sheathed in clear glass and painted aluminum, would rise 17 stories at the corner of Perry and West Streets. Mr. Meier calls the design minimalist. Apartments on the highest floors, expected to fetch upward of $8 million, would offer panoramic views of the river. The ground floor of one tower would hold a cafe developed by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Meier's contribution to Westbeth is very important and appreciated,'' said Katy Bordonaro, a chairwoman of the Greenwich Village Community Task Force, an advocacy group. ''However, people throughout the community are dismayed by his desire to put up so much glass and metal in this very 19th-century-feeling area.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier, who lived on Perry Street in the 1950's, disagreed with her contention. ''There is no uniform scale and no uniform materials,'' he said. ''It varies from every kind of commercial use and every scale of residential use.''</p>
        <p>The Landmarks Preservation Commission seems to agree. Despite many requests from Community Board 2, it never held a hearing on the plan, which did not require any special city approval to move forward. ''We didn't think that the buildings merited landmark status,'' Katy McNab, a spokeswoman for the commission, said of the area in which the towers are being built.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bordonaro and other preservationists are determined to press ahead with an expanded district. They recently began a campaign that included slide-show presentations, and they are installing plaques to commemorate historic sites throughout the proposed district. The first plaque was posted on Weehawken Street, a quiet alley off Christopher Street that is considered among the area's oldest streets.</p>
        <p>But landmark designations take time. ''This West Village area is very vulnerable,'' said Kimberly S. Kearns, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, ''especially with the wonderful new Hudson River park that is being built.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier agrees, albeit from a different perspective. ''When I began Westbeth, that was as far west as anyone thought of going,'' he said. ''If you walk around today, it's totally transformed. This project is just the beginning.''</p>
