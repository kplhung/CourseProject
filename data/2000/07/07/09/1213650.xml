        <p>There's no excuse for no Shakespeare this summer. He's here, there and everywhere on local stages.</p>

(A review is on Page 11.) The festival will also be presenting ''The Taming of the Shrew'' July 19 through Aug. 27. Box office: (845) 265-9575.</p>
        <p>Those who like their ''Shrews'' fast paced and modern can check out a 90-minute production by Trinity Repertory Company. The performance, which is free, begins at 6:30 tonight at Onatru Farm, 99 Elmwood Road in South Salem; family picnicking begins at 5 p.m. The production is presented by the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts and the town of Lewisboro's Department of Parks and Recreation. For information, call the Parks Department: (914) 232-6166.</p>
        <p>Fleetwood Stage has also taken its Shakespeare outdoors, to the great lawn at Wildcliff, overlooking Long Island Sound. Free performances of the ''The Comedy of Errors,'' directed by Lewis Arlt, are scheduled Thursdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., through July 30, at 44 Wildcliff Drive in New Rochelle, adjacent to Hudson Park. There is early admission for picnickers. No reservations are taken; each night 350 people will be admitted, first come first served. Information on Shakespeare on the Sound: (914) 654-8533.</p>
        <p>There was a time when Shakespeare wasn't Shakespeare, but just one more aspiring playwright. And there are a lot of those today. The Schoolhouse Playwrights Workshop in Croton Falls offers a taste of its members' work in ''Summer Shorts,'' a 90-minute marathon. The final performance is at 4 p.m. today; tickets, $10. Reservations  and directions: (914) 277-8477.</p>
        <p>Want to be on stage rather than just watch from beyond the footlights. Fleetwood State has scheduled a A general audition for next season Aug. 8 from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., at the theater on the New Rochelle waterfront. Those wishing to audition should prepare one three-minute monologue, and bring a resume with an 8-by-10 photo attached. Plays that the nonprofit professional theater is considering for next season include ''A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking,'' ''Joe Egg,'' and ''Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill.'' For directions, call (914)-654-8533.</p>

Auditions for next season's productions are now scheduled for Aug. 5 rather than Aug. 8. Information: (914) 654-8533.</p>
