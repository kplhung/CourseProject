        <p>THE new design for Columbus Center raises an important issue for the future of the New York skyline. What is consensus? Is consensus essential for good architecture or does architecture do best without it? Who should speak for the public if not the architect, who is hired for his professional and artistic capacity to interpret a time and place?</p>
        <p>Columbus Center's architect is David Childs, of the New York office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, a firm that has long represented the center of gravity in American architecture. Mr. Childs's new design differs substantially from one prepared by him for the same site 12 years ago. There is more than one way to interpret this difference: public opinion could be changing; Mr. Childs could be changing his aesthetic; or the difference could mean less than meets the eye.</p>
        <p>The 1988 design was a more or less literal homage to Irwin Chanin, architect of the Century and the Majestic apartment buildings on Central Park West. From these twin-towered Art Deco landmarks, Mr. Childs adapted horizontal fins, cubical geometry, masonry walls, symmetrical massing and other identifiable Deco motifs, but enlarged them in a composition three times the scale.</p>
        <p>In the new version, the Deco references are largely confined to the crowns of the two towers: three-story, illuminated lanterns trimmed with rows of vertical steel blades. At the base, a broken colonnade of stone veneer also weighs down the design. In general, however, the new plan advances the concept of abstracted classicism that informed Chanin's design. Period details have given way to crisp geometric solids. The towers have been tweaked into trapezoids. Pearlescent glass has replaced unconvincing cast stone. Setbacks are composed in an assymmetrical, crystalline silhouette.</p>
        <p>I find the new version vastly superior, judged not by some abstract set of values, but by the terms that the 1988 version set forth. Fidelity to history, sensitivity to context: this is roughly how those terms can be summarized. The old version expressed them by mimicking the Century, the Majestic and other twin-towered apartment buildings along Central Park West. The new design gets closer to the ideas beneath their skins. The trapezoidal shape of the towers is more contextual. Instead of simply reproducing the external appearance of buildings located some blocks away, the building now extrudes the geometry of its location into three dimensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Childs intended to take the concept of geometric abstraction even further and prepared a set of models, drawings and computer renderings to that end. He was overruled in November by Joseph B. Rose, the chairman of the City Planning Commission, who had convened a small advisory group to review the design. In what has to be regarded as a preview of the design review panel Mr. Rose has proposed to set up under his management, Mr. Childs was subjected to a costly procedure that ended only when he threatened to take his name off the project. Eventually, much of his design was restored. The Deco hats, alas, remain.</p>
        <p>Ostensibly, the revisions supervised by Mr. Rose were intended to make the design acceptable to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He is considered a traditionalist, and it could be that his brand of traditionalism is shared by most New Yorkers. But what about those of us who believe that tradition goes deeper than period motif?</p>
        <p>Context is a matter of time as well as place, and history deals with the present as well as the past. In the 1980's, postmodern architecture was making its mark on the skyline. The AT&amp;T headquarters, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, was completed in 1983. A movement that had begun two decades earlier with the work of Robert Venturi entered the phase of large-scale commercial building. Mr. Childs's 1988 design was thus a polemical statement. It announced that architects would no longer respect the modernist taboo against the use of period styles. It also stated that corporate clients were eager to support this determination.</p>
        <p>The polemic argued for the value of popular appeal. The public, it was said, was tired of tall glass boxes. And it was tired of seeing familiar streetscapes blown away to make room for them. Modern architecture, it was said, had been unconscionably indifferent to popular taste. Postmodern architecture offered to redress these grievances. It would accommodate the public's desire for the familiar and restore the traditions that prevailed before the tall glass boxes came stalking into town. This was the context in which the 1988 design materialized.</p>
        <p>Not long after, however, the context began to change. Many New Yorkers woke up to the fact that the level of the city's architecture had declined catastrophically in the last 30 years. They saw for themselves that modern architecture cannot be reduced to tall glass boxes and bleak housing projects. It also includes work by Wright, van der Rohe, Saarinen, Roche, Bunshaft, Harrison and others that established New York as the world's most architecturally progressive city. With reason, they began to suspect a correlation between the lack of comparable work today and the postmodern hokum about tradition, context and popular appeal.</p>
        <p>It turns out, for example, that the public likes to be wowed. This is what some people have taken to calling the Bilbao effect, after the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, designed by Frank Gehry. People enjoy the unfamiliar as much in architecture as they do in movies, painting, music, photography, literature and other art forms. Consensus be damned before the fact. Let the applause come later. Or let the brickbats fly, if you prefer.</p>
        <p>The new design for Columbus Center is not Bilbao, needless to say. I doubt even Frank Gehry would want to wrap Columbus Circle in titanium ribbons. But Bilbao is part of the context in which the new design has taken shape. So are the LVMH Tower, the Rose Space Center and the Austrian Cultural Institute now nearing completion on East 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>These three buildings, strikingly different in appearance, share some common features. They are glass. The transparency makes the floors as prominent as the walls. They are formally abstract. They enrich their immediate surroundings by playing off them. They reveal urban relationships that had not yet been articulated. They embody what Eliot meant when he said that historical awareness depends on knowing not just the presence but also the pastness of the past.</p>
        <p>We should conclude from this that postmodern architects stated good goals for architecture but were unable to achieve them. Without those Deco hats, Columbus Center would attain its ambitions, too. Even in its compromised state, the new design moves toward a deeper grasp of history. And it will remain a useful focus for the public debate through which history unfolds.</p>
        <p>DEBATE would be welcome now over the metal and glass screen that will veil the Jazz at Lincoln Center complex to be located in the upper floors of Columbus Center's arc-shaped base. Designed by the artist Jamie Carpenter, the screen would diminish the public presence of the complex -- the most civic-spirited of Columbus Center's six tenants. It would also flatten the extension of the axis from Central Park South. As Joyce Purnick observed in her Metro Matters column in The New York Times a few weeks ago, Columbus Center offers an opportunity to create the effect of opening up 59th Street. Eliminating the screen would enhance that effect.</p>
        <p>This is apparently an issue on which Mr. Childs and Rafael Vinoly, the jazz complex's architect, have not seen eye to eye. Others have seen racial implications in the screening of a space dedicated to this prototypical African-American art form behind a reflective facade. This is not, in any case, an issue that ought to be resolved by the intervention of so-called public art like Mr. Carpenter's. Must we have yet another case in which public art provides a fig leaf to cover failures of the social and architectural imaginations? Debate on the value of public art is also long overdue.</p>
        <p>It's the lack of that debate -- the fear of conflict -- that has been so crippling for New York architecture. There was far more contention when architecture was going up in the postwar decades and the lines weren't drawn between high-brow and popular taste. Some smart people hated the Guggenheim. Some uncultivated people loved it. Ditto the T.W.A. Pavilion, the United Nations headquarters and Lever House. There wasn't this horror of being disliked, this philistine appeal to the public's fear of change. The consensus that architecture enjoyed in the 1950's and 60's was this: it was healthy for people to disagree about it. The real cause for worry arrived when ideas got drowned out by the baby chatter of postmodern public relations.</p>
        <p>The issue of consensus is turning out to be far more complex than the postmodernists ever imagined. It has shifted the terms of architecture from the objective to the subjective realm. The consequences have barely begun to make themselves felt. Indeed, its rupture with historical precedent is scarcely appreciated. Authority in architecture has now passed in part from its traditional external sources -- religion, social hierarchy, history or technology -- toward the psychological landscape where moods, tastes, memories and atmospheres are formed.</p>
        <p>We're long accustomed to locating literature, music, painting and movies in this interior realm. Even architecture is not a stranger to it. Domestic architecture -- Frank Lloyd Wright, Arts and Crafts, the Aesthetic Movement -- took up residence there in the late 19th century. Mr. Venturi placed civic buildings there, even if his postmodern followers couldn't figure out how he did it. But until we get our architecture through neural implants, the outer world will not abandon its claims on this public art form.</p>
        <p>Even without the implants, neural architecture has entered into the way buildings are perceived. This was the idea explored by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien in their design for the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif., completed in 1995. Built for the neuroscientist Gerald Edelman, the institute was partly inspired by Dr. Edelman's theory that the brain's architecture is shaped by our experiences. Tell me what you like, and I will tell you how you're wired. One neural structure does not fit all. We don't attach the same meanings, values and associations to the same images and shapes. And it's not hard wiring we're talking about. Art can recombine the circuits.</p>
        <p>The new design for Columbus Center will bring more than a physical change in the cityscape, in other words. It signifies a restructuring of perception. Context includes the psyche. It is not limited to what's ''out there.'' This porosity of the line between subjective and objective is the beauty part of architecture today. Interiority has got hold of an art form long governed by externals. What we call consensus amounts to a continual testing of the interior and its claims.</p>
