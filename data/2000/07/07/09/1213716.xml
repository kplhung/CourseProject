        <p>The grand coincidence was the source of countless double takes. With tens of thousands of people lining the shores of Narragansett Bay on Sunday to watch the outgoing Tall Ships parade of sail, an inbound, 110-foot catamaran called Club Med weaved its way through a huge spectator fleet.</p>
        <p>Between blinks one could take in the classic spoon-bowed Canadian schooner Bluenose as well as the French-built Club Med, a relatively spindly wing-masted multihull replete with a powder-blue paint job dashed with colorful fish and a matching quartet of gaudy, bikini-clad maidens -- a pair for each bow.</p>

        <p>The grand coincidence was the source of countless double takes. With tens of thousands of people lining the shores of Narragansett Bay on Sunday to watch the outgoing Tall Ships parade of sail, an inbound, 110-foot catamaran called Club Med weaved its way through a huge spectator fleet.</p>
        <p>Between blinks one could take in the classic spoon-bowed Canadian schooner Bluenose as well as the French-built Club Med, a relatively spindly wing-masted multihull replete with a powder-blue paint job dashed with colorful fish and a matching quartet of gaudy, bikini-clad maidens -- a pair for each bow.</p>
        <p>The two ships passing in the day were not only of separate eras. They appeared to be from different planets.</p>
        <p>Like Star Trek's Spock, the next afternoon I was beamed aboard Club Med with a handful of other journalists and a short guest list that included the 1992 America's Cup winner, Bill Koch, and the New York Yacht Club commodore, George Isdale Jr., for a remarkable daysail in Rhode Island Sound.</p>
        <p>My experience with big multihulls is limited, though in the mid-80's I did cross the Atlantic with the legendary British sailor Robin Knox-Johnston aboard his 60-foot cat British Airways, a hulking craft the French yachting press derisively nicknamed ''the truck of the seas.'' While the knot-meter sometimes hovered in the low- to mid-20's on the passage, it was inadequate preparation for a spin on Club Med.</p>
        <p>If British Airways was a pickup, Club Med is a Ferrari. Launched less than two months ago, the boat has already claimed the title as the world's quickest oceangoing sailboat, having set the record last month for the fastest 24-hour run: a purposeful 625.7 miles, an average speed over 26 knots, on a trip from Spain to the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>''After the fact, it's easy to say that it was easy,'' said Club Med's skipper, Grant Dalton, a New Zealander who has spent about half his 42 years racing sailboats around the world. ''But actually, it was easy.''</p>
        <p>Dalton is new to large catamarans but he says he is hooked, and soon after his 14-man international crew had hoisted the main and set a small jib, it was apparent why. Reaching across the entrance to the bay in about 18 knots of southerly breeze, with a blurred seascape rapidly receding beneath the net trampolines laced between the hulls and with the entire boat emitting a low, eerie hum, Dalton soon had Club Med piercing the light chop at a windswept 31 knots.</p>
        <p>''You never get sick of going over 30,'' he shouted. ''I haven't yet, anyway.''</p>
        <p>Still, for the most part, Club Med's pro crew effected a stoic nonchalance to the proceedings. But we whooping 30-knot rookies, tilting unsteadily to windward in the bursts of acceleration, were beside ourselves. Dooie Isdale's grin resembled the one he sported while dancing with the Kiwi actress Lucy Lawless -- better known as Xena, the Warrior Princess -- at a party during last spring's America's Cup regatta in New Zealand.</p>
        <p>One does not exact such speed without a price, however. In Club Med's case, however, that means keeping the boat as light as possible. Asked to describe the freeze-dried chow consumed on distance races, Nicolas Pichelin, a French crew member, called it ''disgusting.'' And his British mate Ed Danby's reply to a query about onboard creature comforts was equally pointed: ''nonexistent.''</p>
        <p>Misery loves company, of course, and in the months ahead the Club Med crew will have a slew of fellow offshore sailors with whom to commiserate, for the boat's ultimate mission is to win the Race, the round-the-world jaunt that begins Dec. 31 from Barcelona, Spain. American Steve Fossett's Play Station and Englishman Pete Goss's Team Phillips are both entered, and another Yank, Cam Lewis, is still seeking funds for his Team Adventure syndicate. Lewis is building a sister ship to Club Med.</p>
        <p>Dalton believes the victorious crew will circle the planet in 62 days. ''I think you'll need to get on a 675-mile-a-day pace,'' he said. ''And I think we're capable of that.''</p>
        <p>In the Southern Ocean, Club Med's solid 480-square-foot wing mast -- an area equal in size to the entire sail plans of many midsize cruising boats -- could prove troublesome. After all, even with all sail doused, the mast presents a considerable amount of windage aloft.</p>
        <p>''That's a static load, and if we get 75 knots, we're tumbleweed,'' Dalton said.</p>
        <p>To combat such a dire capsize circumstance, he said Club Med is equipped with substantial water-ballast tanks in each bow. ''If we get into a survival situation, we'll flood the tanks, sink the boat low into the water, and hang on,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But on an afternoon off Newport, life-and-death storms were the last things on anyone's mind.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that these boats are 20 percent or more faster than any boats that have ever been built,'' Dalton said.</p>
        <p>Having proved his point, he swung the wheel and pointed his thoroughbred toward the barn.</p>
