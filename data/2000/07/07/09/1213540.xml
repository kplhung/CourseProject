        <p>Jennifer Lynn Brackett was married yesterday afternoon to Maurice Stuart Lathers Jr. at Bent of the River, an Audubon Society nature preserve in Southbury, Conn. The Rev. Walter Pittman, a United Church of Christ minister, performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brackett, 31, is keeping her name. She is a family nurse practitioner at the Hill Health Center in New Haven. She graduated from Colby College and holds two master's degrees, one in public health from Boston University and the other in nursing from the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions. She is a daughter of Nancy Brackett and Dr. John W. Brackett of Southbury, Conn. Her father retired as the director of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lathers, 36, is known as Stuart. He owns an architectural firm in New Haven. He graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and received his master's degree in architecture from Yale. His mother, Mary June Lathers, lives in Birmingham, Mich., where she is an administrative assistant at Nantucket Capital, a money management firm. His father, Mr. Lathers Sr. of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., retired as a service-support manager for General Motors' Saturn division in Troy, Mich., and is now a vice president at Engineering Analysis, an automotive consulting firm in Bingham Farms, Mich.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brackett and Mr. Lathers met in 1993 while working on construction of the New Haven Rowing Club boathouse in Oxford, Conn., which the bridegroom designed and the bride, a member, helped to build. The couple now compete together in the club's sculling events.</p>
