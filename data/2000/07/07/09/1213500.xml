        <p>The Powerpuff Girls may be the hottest thing in cartoon tie-in merchandising -- the T-shirts, the plush toys, the key chains. But three other supergirls, who were saving the world before Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup burst on the scene, are making a bid for attention in toy stores. And they don't have a curfew. Living Toyz has just released an ElectraWoman action figure from ''ElectraWoman and DynaGirl,'' the 1976 Saturday morning cult favorite from the ''H. R. Pufnstuf'' producers Sid and Marty Krofft. 'I went into Toys 'R' Us in Santa Monica,'' Marty Krofft said, ''and the guy who runs the action figure department said he'd never seen so many adults come into the department alone.''</p>
        <p>Even after Alicia Silverstone's disastrous turn as Batgirl in 1997's ''Batman and Robin,'' there are two new 12-inch action figures of the curvy crime fighter: Hasbro's black-uniformed version from ''Batman: The Animated Series,'' and a 70's-style gray-and-blue model that's as voluptuous as Batman is buff. It's a Warner Brothers Studio Store exclusive. Even Barbie has thrown her magic lasso into the ring. The world's best-selling doll is now available dressed as Wonder Woman. Mattel merged the two icons for a collectors' edition doll for $50 (bullet-deflecting bracelets included).</p>
