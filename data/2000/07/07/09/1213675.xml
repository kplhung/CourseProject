        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>This is an objection to your ''Fair'' rating of Cortina Ristorante on June 11. I, members of my family and assorted friends and acquaintances have been patrons of Cortina several times a month for almost three years, and on all our visits we have unanimously enjoyed the ambience, service, food and music.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>This is an objection to your ''Fair'' rating of Cortina Ristorante on June 11. I, members of my family and assorted friends and acquaintances have been patrons of Cortina several times a month for almost three years, and on all our visits we have unanimously enjoyed the ambience, service, food and music.</p>
        <p>The premises have been tastefully redecorated by the owner, Ms. Damao, and the decor is of the highest quality.</p>
        <p>Without exception, the attitude and service of the servers has always been courteous and dedicated without being obtrusive and every meal served to me or others in my presence has, also without exception, been thoroughly enjoyed to the last morsel.</p>
        <p>Until your review, all other descriptions of Cortina's food and service contained only superlatives. Your ''Fair'' review is unfair and should be disregarded by patrons who will continue to savor their dining experience at Cortina.</p>
