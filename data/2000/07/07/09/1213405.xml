        <p>WILLIAM HELMREICH, 54, a sociologist from Great Neck, thrives on controversy. The first of his 10 books was about the Black Panthers. The next delved into the insular ultra-Orthodox yeshiva world and another explored stereotypes of different nationalities. As co-director of the City College of New York Center for Mediation and Conflict Resolution, he makes his living bringing diverse groups together: Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, blacks and Jews, high school students and teachers.</p>
        <p>So when the Orthodox Caucus, a national leadership group based in Cedarhurst that addresses challenges facing the Jewish community, approached him to form a mediation program, he readily agreed. The goal: to help Jews get along with other Jews. First, they would work together on outreach projects, like cleaning up an old synagogue on the Lower East Side. Once they got to know and trust each other, they could discuss religious differences.</p>
        <p>In the workplace, Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews are always meeting. But at the social level, interaction doesn't really happen, Dr. Helmreich said. Each denomination feels passionately about its Judaism but observes it differently. Strictly Orthodox Jews hold the 613 God-given commandments as an inviolable part of their daily lives, viewing the more progressive Reform and Conservative traditions as diluted and less authentic.</p>
        <p>For evidence of negative stereotyping among Jewish subgroups, Dr. Helmreich said he didn't have to look farther than his own village, where Temple Beth El, a Reform congregation, and the Great Neck Synagogue, an Orthodox congregation, are nearby. ''People at Temple Beth El,'' he said, ''have complained that some of the Orthodox are hypocritical, that they park their cars on the Sabbath in the Beth El lot and walk to the Great Neck Synagogue, which is a block away. They've complained that the Orthodox make fun of their temple as they walk by, loudly proclaiming it to be a church.''</p>
        <p>''On the other side, Temple Beth El kids make fun of kids with yarmulkes as they walk by,'' he said. ''This used to be the case when kids lived in non-Jewish neighborhoods, but in Great Neck? Between Jews?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Helmreich added that people complain that they are not able to form friendships with neighbors of different denominations, that conflicts persist between the congregations' rabbis and that the divisiveness has caused problems with the community-wide Israel Bonds dinner and a Yom Hashoa commemoration.</p>
        <p>But a forum on domestic violence sponsored by the Women's Tefila Group of the Great Neck Synagogue held in May brought together Jews from across the religious spectrum.  And Marc Schneier, rabbi of the Hampton Synagogue in Westhampton Beach, an Orthodox congregation with a significant Reform membership, and president of the North American Board of Rabbis, said that nationally, interdenominational activity is increasing.</p>
        <p>''I am filled with buoyant optimism,'' Rabbi Schneier said. ''There are some in the Jewish community who very much want to maintain a divisiveness or polarization for their own agenda. I don't believe that's how rabbis feel, I don't believe that's how lay people feel, I don't believe that's how people feel in the pews. We find that there is a concerted effort made in terms of rabbis acknowledging that there are these issues that transcend our religious, theological and ideological differences and that we have to work towards common cause.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Helmreich stressed that the same tension exists in other Jewish communities. In Israel, where the battle is even more pronounced, youths on the fringe of highly observant Orthodox Jewish groups were suspected in the torching of a Conservative synagogue in Jerusalem in June. Even the Synagogue Council of America, a national organization, disbanded several years ago because the clergy couldn't get along.</p>
        <p>''Jews are 2 percent of the population in this country,'' Dr. Helmreich said. ''As a group that's so small and that continues to assimilate, we simply can't afford to fight with each other. It's very destructive. And if we really want to stop it we can.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Helmreich culled representatives from Great Neck's major Jewish congregations to work together on communal projects for his case study. Rabbis, however, weren't invited. The idea was to prove that the issues that united the group -- Israel, anti-Semitism, human justice and a concern for Jewish identity -- were greater than those that divided them.</p>
        <p>''We felt that if they got to know each other, they might actually get to like each other,'' he said, planning to use the program as a model to form study groups nationwide that could discuss religion without rancor. ''Nobody in the group was here to try to convert someone to their point of view.''</p>
        <p>So on a recent Sunday, Dr. Helmreich and 14 middle-aged participants met at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Northport, an impartial setting where the nature of their Judaism would not be an issue, together visiting mostly non-Jewish patients.</p>
        <p>There was no palpable tension as the group toured the hospital's Little White Chapel with its revolving (yes, literally revolving) Jewish, Catholic and Protestant altars and non-denominational stained-glass windows.  Later, they gathered in a room to chat.</p>
        <p>''While I'm Reform, I don't walk around every day thinking these people are Orthodox or Catholic or Muslim,'' said Paul Schwartz, 52, creative director of an advertising agency. ''Why does it matter what kind of Jew we are to go to a V.A. hospital? But I'm realizing now that I myself have been walking around with stereotypes.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was that they were visiting a V.A. hospital, said Simi Atkins, a neutralizing activity that made the participants acutely aware that they were all simply Americans reaching out to other Americans.</p>
        <p>''I had no idea who these people were,'' said Mrs. Atkins, a teacher who comes from one of the founding families of Temple Israel of Great Neck, a Conservative congregation. ''What their religion was didn't really matter to me. And why should it matter?''</p>
        <p>But Martin Sokol, 62, a leather manufacturer, thought that while their humanity united them, different ways of observing Judaism and their political ideas would always keep them apart.</p>
        <p>Though he did not originally come from an Orthodox background, Mr. Sokol said he tended to socialize only with those of the same level of Orthodoxy he now practices and a schism exists even within his own family.</p>
        <p>As a young refugee from Hungary, Vera Bernstein, 52, recalled hearing comments about ''those people.'' She said: ''In Great Neck, in my real estate work, I hear it all the time: 'Oh, the Orthodox.' And rather than meeting or exploring contacts with other people, they'll say ''They're not the kind of people you want to be with.'' Mrs. Bernstein is Orthodox.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Perrell, 57, an active member of Temple Isaiah, a Reform congregation that meets weekly in a church, was upset that some might not consider his daughter Jewish because her mother was not. He attributed some of the problem to the largely Jewish makeup of Great Neck. ''We're sort of a ghetto,'' he said. ''But we have ghettoes within and it doesn't make a lot of sense. And we should be able to do more.''</p>
        <p>By addressing stereotyping and getting along well, Arden Smith, 48, a podiatrist and a Conservative Jew, felt they could do just that. But Judy Rosenzweig, 52, who is Reform and a preschool teacher, wasn't so sure.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately we all know that in our community there are some who don't want these barriers broken down, the things that Orthodox and Reform say about each other,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sokol thought the differences in religious practice were the sticking point. But Mrs. Rosenzweig had trouble with the idea of a level of observance, and wondered just whose standards Mr. Sokol was applying.</p>
        <p>''I know that we will never be the same,'' she said. ''But I think it's so important to accept, to say, 'all right, you live your life and you want to observe it your way,' that's fine. But don't demean how someone else does it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Helmreich stepped in whenever tempers began to flare. And it was clear that the main schism pitted the Orthodox against the Conservative and Reform.</p>
        <p>''The Orthodox are never going to validate the others,'' said Bob Atkins, 63, a lawyer and a convert to Conservative Judaism. ''But I think we can learn to avoid the denigrating, looking-down comments. There should be recognition of the varieties of Judaism and that they're all valid. People want to preserve the distinctions, but it's like Howard Johnson's. There are 28 varieties, but it's all ice cream.''</p>
