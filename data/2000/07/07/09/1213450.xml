        <p>IN the dark ages of the 1950's and 60's, a package sent to sleep-away camp was filled with salami and rye, red licorice and dot candy and stationery and stamps to encourage the detested chore of letters home.</p>

        <p>IN the dark ages of the 1950's and 60's, a package sent to sleep-away camp was filled with salami and rye, red licorice and dot candy and stationery and stamps to encourage the detested chore of letters home.</p>
        <p>Now food is forbidden, daily letters are not required and an entire industry has sprung up to fill camp packages with only the coolest stuff and to pack and send them on predetermined dates so all a busy parent has to do is pay the bill.</p>
        <p>Bonnie Ernst, the owner of Scarsdale Childs Play, the sine qua non for camp packages in a county where satisfied children are the sine qua non, has a ledger of clients who don't bother to come into the store. They tell her how much to spend and when to ship. Some of their packages are already wrapped and ready to go, with contents recorded so there's no repetition.</p>
        <p>This railroad-flat of a store, toys piled from floor to ceiling, is still a scrum of mothers, many in tennis clothes, rummaging for the newest new thing. Sure, there are old standbys, like Mad Libs, jacks and lanyard string. And items that have been popular for a few years, like milky pens and battery-operated fans. But nobody wants to send what they sent last year.</p>
        <p>So, shoppers gravitate toward Polaroid's new I-Zone camera, which takes pictures in the form of little stickers. Or My Ultra Secret Stuff Journal, which can only be read under the glow of a black-light pen.</p>
        <p>Or the remote-controlled Whoopee cushion, as advertised on Howard Stern, which promises ''new louder realistic'' you-know-what's ''up to 50 feet and through walls.'' Or the Icky Yicky Ball, a rubbery brain in a net bag.</p>
        <p>Or Nyoshoes, best described as thong underwear for the feet. Or Bunk Junk, a canvas holder for bite plates or eyeglasses, which hangs on the rail of a cot.</p>
        <p>One of the alarming developments, to this childless codger who loved sleepaway camp more than anything, are the commercial items that we used to make for ourselves. Does anyone remember the Cootie Catcher, made of paper folded into a series of triangles? They sell them now, ready made. What about Spaldeens, which girls used to play My Name Is Alice and boys used for stickball? Now the balls are packaged with a book of instructions for games I assumed were coded in the genes.</p>
        <p>How about the tatty pillow cases and T-shirts that we autographed at summer's end to a torrent of goodbye tears? Well, now they are sold for that purpose, smartly packaged in tubes, marking pen included. Or there's a stuffed fabric pizza, pen also included, which comes in a regulation pizza box. Ms. Ernst attributes this development to the cost of designer linens and clothing. There'd be hell to pay for ruining them.</p>
        <p>Even letters home are now all but written for you, thanks to fill-in-the-blank postcards: ''Dear ----------------, Greetings! Camp is --------------------. The coolest thing we've done so far is ------------------ . Say hi to -------------- for me. Bye, ------ --------.'' Theoni Katis, the owner of Tra La La in Irvington, says these are especially popular with noncommunicative boys.</p>
        <p>Boys and girls alike are clamoring for something that neither Scarsdale Childs  Play or Tra La La carries: ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' by J. K. Rowling.  The wildly popular book, in an incomprehensible publishing decision, was to go on sale July 8, and not a moment sooner. As camp buses pulled away from loading points in Westchester and elsewhere last month, children could be heard shouting from windows, ''Remember to send Harry Four,'' as the latest issue in the series is known.</p>
        <p>The Larchmont Store spent the early days of July preparing as if for D-Day. It is a 50's throwback if there ever was one with toys, notions, housewares, clothing and books all in one place (''Just no feed and grain,'' says the owner, Eric Nussbaum). Mr. Nussbaum had hundreds of orders for the book, listed on a clipboard, camp addresses included.</p>
        <p>''It will be the biggest thing to go off to camp for us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Today, the books are on their way, headed to Camp Tamakwa, Point O Pines, Watitoh and Winaukee. Mr. Nussbaum swore no copies would leave ahead of schedule, not even to his 13-year-old daughter, Sarah, at Camp Wah-Nee in Torrington, Conn.</p>
        <p>''To your own daughter, you wouldn't send it early?'' asked his wife, Fredda Cohen. ''This mother would.''</p>
