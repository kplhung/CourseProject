        <p>THE French director Francois Ozon has made thrillers about homicidal house guests and high school killers. In satire, he's explored the lighter sides of cannibalism, sadomasochism and incest. But his latest film tackles the horrors of la vie a deux. ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' is his screen adaptation of a play written by the German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder at the age of 19 -- an utterly disillusioned teenage vision of a couple's intimate life.</p>
        <p>''Water Drops'' will begin its New York run on Wednesday. (''Criminal Lovers,'' Mr. Ozon's previous film, opens July 21.) This chamber piece for four players is set in Germany during the 1970's. One evening, Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), an insurance salesman and aging Lothario, brings the 19-year-old Franz (Malik Zidi) back to his apartment and seduces him. Six months later their relationship has calcified: Leopold ceaselessly bickers and complains, while sensitive, intellectual Franz is meekly loving. When Franz's ex-fiancee (Ludivine Sagnier) and Leopold's former girlfriend (Anna Thomson) show up at their apartment, the older man's frightful egotism and sexual charisma spark a lot of black humor and a few grim consequences.</p>

        <p>THE French director Francois Ozon has made thrillers about homicidal house guests and high school killers. In satire, he's explored the lighter sides of cannibalism, sadomasochism and incest. But his latest film tackles the horrors of la vie a deux. ''Water Drops on Burning Rocks'' is his screen adaptation of a play written by the German auteur Rainer Werner Fassbinder at the age of 19 -- an utterly disillusioned teenage vision of a couple's intimate life.</p>
        <p>''Water Drops'' will begin its New York run on Wednesday. (''Criminal Lovers,'' Mr. Ozon's previous film, opens July 21.) This chamber piece for four players is set in Germany during the 1970's. One evening, Leopold (Bernard Giraudeau), an insurance salesman and aging Lothario, brings the 19-year-old Franz (Malik Zidi) back to his apartment and seduces him. Six months later their relationship has calcified: Leopold ceaselessly bickers and complains, while sensitive, intellectual Franz is meekly loving. When Franz's ex-fiancee (Ludivine Sagnier) and Leopold's former girlfriend (Anna Thomson) show up at their apartment, the older man's frightful egotism and sexual charisma spark a lot of black humor and a few grim consequences.</p>
        <p>''At 19, Fassbinder had already formed his view of the world and human relationships -- already, he didn't believe in love,'' Mr. Ozon said over coffee one recent morning in SoHo. ''He never staged or filmed that play, but the seeds of all his later works are in it. Perhaps it was just too personal. When I presented 'Water Drops' at the Berlin International Film Festival in February, members of Fassbinder's circle were in the audience; they told me that in his youth he resembled Franz, but when he got older, he became Leopold.''</p>
        <p>Fassbinder died in 1982 at the age of 36, leaving behind more than 40 films that dissect and demystify every aspect of postwar German society, from transsexual love and the aspirations of anarchists to the workings of major corporations. At 32, Mr. Ozon's career has made a quick start. Three years ago, his short film, ''See the Sea'' -- a taut psychological drama about a new mother whose vacation house on a beautiful island is suddenly invaded by a sullen hitchhiker -- earned its writer and director comparisons to Chabrol and Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>In ''Sitcom,'' a comedy and Mr. Ozon's first feature, a typical bourgeois French household dissolves into a den of perversion when a pet white rat unleashes the family members' pent-up libidos.</p>
        <p>''Criminal Lovers'' was loosely inspired by a murder that took place in the French provinces. ''A few years ago, an adolescent boy and girl killed a fellow student,'' Mr. Ozon said. ''They were great admirers of Oliver Stone's film 'Natural Born Killers.' And they wanted to commit a senseless crime. I didn't want to present a realist version of these events, to offer psychological or social explanations, but rather to tie them to something deeper and more symbolic, like a fairy tale.''</p>
        <p>In fact, that film's style gradually shifts from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' to ''Hansel and Gretel,'' as Alice (Natacha Regnier) and Luc (Jeremie Renier) kill Said (Salim Kechiouche), an Arab classmate, then take refuge in the forest.</p>
        <p>Alice, who incites her boyfriend to murder, takes her cues not from Hollywood but from the poetry of that troubled French teenager Arthur Rimbaud. ''In real life, the girl wrote very beautiful poems,'' Mr. Ozon said. ''Excerpts from her diary were published in the press. She wrote of her desire for this Arab boy, and how she had to kill him because she wanted him so much. It reminded me of Jean Genet. At the same time, it was frightening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozon remains fascinated by adolescence. ''It's virgin territory,'' he said. ''A blank page. Anything can happen.'' He grew up in Paris (where he still lives), the oldest child in a family of bourgeois intellectuals, and describes his own youth as ''turbulent.'' ''I was in revolt against my parents,'' he said, ''at once very aggressive and introverted. My Catholic education had given me a taste for sin.''</p>
        <p>His earliest films starred his siblings and were shot with his father's Super-8 movie camera. By the time he graduated from Femis, the prestigious, state-run French film school, he had made more than 40 shorts on film and video.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ozon's boyish charm seems purely Parisian, but his outre and somber preoccupations have made him something of an anomaly among French directors of his generation. ''Intimate dramas inspired by the Nouvelle Vague and set in Parisian apartments are not his thing,'' said Olivier Delbosc, whose company, Fidelite Productions, has produced or co-produced all of Mr. Ozon's features. ''And he loves to work very fast,'' Mr. Delbosc added. ''He's like a bulldozer; we just follow along with him.''</p>
        <p>A bulldozer with a light touch, however. ''Francois is very playful, very joyful to work with,'' said Malik Zidi, who plays Franz in ''Water Drops.''  ''He's both intellectual and childlike. Fassbinder's text is very heavy. But on the set, Francois made it seem fresh and almost buoyant.''</p>
        <p>Too young to have seen Fassbinder's films when they first opened, Mr. Ozon discovered the German director's work retrospectively. ''Fassbinder spoke of Germany in a way that no other filmmaker has spoken of his country, of its wounds and hurt,'' he said. ''And I'm attracted to his way of working so quickly, his cinematic bulimia, using a small band of the faithful, and with or without money. Of course, there was a dark side to his method. Sometimes when he was broke, he'd ask his actresses to work as prostitutes.''</p>
        <p>WITH its deadpan humor, single setting and claustrophobic focus on a few characters, ''Water Drops'' recalls the style of such Fassbinder classics as ''The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant.'' At the same time, Mr. Ozon's version is distinctively French, far more tightly controlled and lighter than the original, closer to farce than tragedy. He also moved the play's setting up to the 1970's. ''Fassbinder wrote it in the early 60's, but he was so far ahead of his time,'' Mr. Ozon said. ''The men's homosexuality is not an issue. They're a couple like any other.''</p>
        <p>That period is also linked to Mr. Ozon's childhood memories of Germany. ''We went there almost every year to visit friends of my father's,'' he said. ''The daily life fascinated me, the beer and sandwiches, the cleanliness and the colors, which were so sad. The country was still in the midst of postwar reconstruction. People worked a lot. They were still caught in the guilt of what had happened.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Ozon, the ravages of German history lie behind Fassbinder's ruthless portraits of sexual opportunism and failed intimacy. ''Fassbinder often repeated that there was no such thing as a marginal existence,'' he said. ''In 'Fox and His Friends,' for example, he showed a homosexual milieu in 1970's Germany as a culture entirely apart, yet reproducing the same traps as classic heterosexual society. It's fascinating, and also deeply disturbing. Because when you're on the margins, you can imagine for yourself a certain liberty. But he showed that it wasn't so.''</p>
