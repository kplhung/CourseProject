        <p>''Fund-Raising Plan Angers Free-Thinking Park Activists'' (June 18) raises a fundamental issue regarding the care of parks. In an era of diminishing support for the city's public green spaces, what are citizens to do? Since 1970, the number of paid Parks Department staff in New York has decreased by 70 percent, according to Partnerships for Parks. Watchdog organizations like the City Parks Council have fought a noble rear-guard action, but the facts indicate a long-term trend that transcends politics and administrations.</p>
        <p>Some volunteer organizations like the East Village Parks Conservancy, faced with the deterioration of their parks, have partnered with the city and developed a model approach that has nothing to do with privatization. Rather it fosters a sense of ownership, commitment and pride.</p>

        <p>Without this kind of activism in the face of municipal neglect, the few open spaces that shade and protect the marches and protests of other  activists would surely disappear.</p>
        <p>Allen Ginsberg was an activist in the truest sense. He got things done!</p>
