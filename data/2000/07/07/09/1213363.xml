        <p>It's barbecue season again, and with shrinks across the nation lemming their way to vacation, the traditional celebrations of American familial ambivalence over a piece of roasted meat are once again set to spin out of control.</p>
        <p>Take the Reltnee family, a Hollywood cliche. There's Dad Reltnee in the backyard, smothered in loud Hawaiian shirt or hilarious apron, possible funny toque atop, brandishing the newfangled long-handled fork with built-in thermometer or wrasslin' with the coals; daughters Kitteny and Bronwyn shooting baskets in the driveway; son Diderot thumbing his way through a Game Boy; and Mom, eternal Mom, entering the yard with plates of sliced tomatoes up and down her arms.</p>

        <p>It's barbecue season again, and with shrinks across the nation lemming their way to vacation, the traditional celebrations of American familial ambivalence over a piece of roasted meat are once again set to spin out of control.</p>
        <p>Take the Reltnee family, a Hollywood cliche. There's Dad Reltnee in the backyard, smothered in loud Hawaiian shirt or hilarious apron, possible funny toque atop, brandishing the newfangled long-handled fork with built-in thermometer or wrasslin' with the coals; daughters Kitteny and Bronwyn shooting baskets in the driveway; son Diderot thumbing his way through a Game Boy; and Mom, eternal Mom, entering the yard with plates of sliced tomatoes up and down her arms.</p>
        <p>The lighting of the coals -- don't never spray them with lighter fluid, Diderot, or boom! -- begins about 11; half a Boston butt, marinated overnight in a rub of cumin, cayenne and paprika, goes in at 11:45; friends bearing gifts -- an ''authentic'' sauce sampler from Memphis, a case of commemorative Britney Spears-shaped beers -- arrive at 12; coolers, brews and syrupy juices flow at 12:01.</p>
        <p>Every subject in the world is ripe for discussion, and for once, sports and the market don't dominate. Barbecuing does! Everyone has his chance to advise, prod, exaggerate, tell the barbecue equivalent of fish stories about legendary Q's (as insiders call them, reduced from BBQ, itself reduced) they've been to or heard about. Naturally, someone brings up Kansas City and Arthur Bryant's, Calvin Trillin is invoked and a reasoned debate breaks out between the vinegar-based enthusiasts of western North Carolina and the tomato-based fanatics from the East. New Mexicans and Texans are dismissed as beef wimps, but the couple who've been to Hawaii and witnessed a whole hog wrapped in banana leaves and buried in hot coals for a luau are greeted with awe and reverence.</p>
        <p>By 4 the Boston butt -- the meatier half of the pork shoulder -- comes out, lacquered black and glistening with all the bastings. Now Mom gets to strut, applying the condiments she's so justly famous for -- not just the tomatoes, but her slaw and potato salad too. Bees and ants head for the sticky shoulder, but the Reltnees welcome them! The conviviality goes on at least till twilight, the memory at least forever.</p>
        <p>Thank you Mr. Mayer, Mr. Goldwyn, Mr. Zanuck.</p>
        <p>But what about the imagined barbecues of Mr. Albee, of Strindberg and Francis Bacon, of that obstreperous British poet, Philip Larkin, whose feelings about family eloquently inform ''This Be the Verse,'' in which he explains how they mess you up, your mum and dad:</p>
        <p>They may not mean to, but they do.</p>
        <p>They fill you up with the faults they had</p>
        <p>And add some extra, just for you.</p>
        <p>But, he continues, they were messed up in their turn:</p>
        <p>By fools in old-style hats and coats,</p>
        <p>Who half the time were soppy-stern</p>
        <p>And half at one another's throats.</p>
        <p>Man hands on misery to man.</p>
        <p>It deepens like a coastal shelf.</p>
        <p>Get out as early as you can,</p>
        <p>And don't have any kids yourself.</p>
        <p>Whew. Any Q for these misfits? They may not have family or friends, or, if they do, they may not want to spend hours divining the ingredients of God's Favorite Goo. Or maybe they just can't stand all that cheer and garrulity.</p>
        <p>Well, take heart; there is Q for Larkinites, too, and it's called water-smoking. It's delightfully misanthropic, or can be, and is absolutely delicious -- better than dry-smoking, usually.</p>
        <p>I'm terminally fed up with ''world championship'' BBQ that turns out to be a pungently sweet or fiery sauce masking dried-out ribs and briskets -- virtually impossible with water-smoking. The Reltnees were performing no disservice by dry-smoking their pork shoulder: because the fat content is so high, the slow cooking dissolves it and the shoulder becomes self-basting. But dry-smoking turns leaner cuts and all poultry, game, fish and veg into wizened old men bent over with canes. Water-smoking baptizes them into juicy infancy.</p>
        <p>And the process positively discourages socializing! There's nothing to do during water-smoking except watch a four-foot-high blue-steel cylinder sit there. You might baste two or three times, or replace the wood chips, or refill the water pan, but that's it. Because the timing's crucial, a meat thermometer's essential.</p>
        <p>Only five years ago, few smokers were available to the public, but with the surge in Q's popularity, all sorts in all price ranges are on the market today -- from around $90 for the blue-steel cylinder to gleaming stainless-steel units big as small apartments for $7,000.</p>
        <p>For water-smoking, the heat source of choice is electricity rather than charcoal or gas because the temperature needs to stay relatively constant at around 200 degrees, and charcoal and gas fluctuate too much. Since a pan of hot water is suspended above the heat source, the food in a water-smoker is constantly moistened -- not by steam, because the water never boils (or it shouldn't) -- but by the humidity generated, with juicy, juicy results.</p>
        <p>Woods used must be hard -- soft woods like pine burn a nasty pitch and smell worse than Chinese herbs. Wood chips perform best. Choicest are hickory (most popular), mesquite (trendiest), oak (very big in England), pecan (subtlest), almond (most rarefied -- purportedly Alice Waters's favorite) and various fruit woods like cherry and apple (slightly sweet, but not icky sweet).</p>
        <p>Here's what will happen: the turkey will come out looking food-stylized and unreal: your guests will think you're serving them a theatrical prop. It'll have unbelievably varnished, tight brown skin -- but the insides will burst with smoky wetness. If you believe nothing else I've written or will ever write -- and why should you? -- believe in the brilliant appearance, texture and flavor of this bird.</p>
        <p>The Boston butt pork shoulder will surprise you -- it won't be falling off the bone like traditional BBQ-ed pork, but it will be succulent and spicy and smoky, almost rare; again, you will never have had a pork roast like it. The salmon, too, will open your eyes. I wish I could promise the same thing about the roasted onions, which I haven't quite figured out; I also tried water-smoking apples and pears, which seemed like a good idea, but a couple of former BBQ judges who happened by for dinner asked the most devastating of all cooking questions: ''Why?''</p>
        <p>In truth, you don't have to be pathological or Philip Larkin to enjoy water-smoking -- but it's fair to say, it is the only Q he'd approve of.</p>
        <p>Here's the technique basic to all water-smoking:</p>
        <p>1. You may marinate or dry-rub the food the night before -- or an hour before.</p>
        <p>2. An hour or more before smoking, soak wood chips in water and bring the food to room temperature.</p>
        <p>3. When ready to cook, plug in the electric smoker (if you prefer charcoal, fend for yourself), place the chips between the electric coils and suspend the water pan above on the supports provided. Fill with hot water or hot wine, beer, etc. (Cold liquid just prolongs the cooking time.)</p>
        <p>4. Brush your food with whatever liquid you've chosen.</p>
        <p>5. Place the grids above the water pan, put the food on the grill, put the top on the smoker.</p>
        <p>6. If smoking food for more than 2 hours -- the turkey and pork below, for instance -- you should baste and check the water and wood.</p>
        <p>Water-Smoked Turkey For Philip Larkin  1 12-pound turkey (see note)</p>
        <p>1/2 pound butter  1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  1 tablespoon soy sauce  3 cloves of garlic, chopped salt and pepper  1 cup water.</p>
        <p>1. Boil all the ingredients except the turkey. Brush the mixture on the turkey before, halfway through and at the end of smoking.</p>
        <p>2. Water-smoke for 4 to 5 hours. When the meat thermometer reads 160 degrees, take the turkey out. It can rest for as much as an hour before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>NOTE: Water-smokers are available from Barbeques Galore at www.bbqgalore-online.com or (800) 752-3085.</p>
        <p>Roasted Onions  6 large Vidalia or Spanish onions</p>
        <p>3/4 cup melted butter  Salt and pepper  2 teaspoons thyme.</p>
        <p>1. Peel and core onions.</p>
        <p>2. Baste the outside with butter. Fill cores with seasonings and butter.</p>
        <p>3. Brush tops with melted butter. Wrap one-third the way up in foil to hold them together, and smoke for 45 minutes to an hour.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Get Down, Mr. Brown  According to the colorful book ''Smoke and Spice,'' by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison, ''Mr. Brown'' is a Southern expression for the dark, outside part of BBQ pork. The rub here, modified from their book, can be applied the night before -- or an hour before.</p>
        <p>1 6-to-7 1/2-pound Boston-butt portion of the pork shoulder  2 tablespoons mustard  2 tablespoons cumin  2 tablespoons paprika dolce  1 tablespoon salt  2/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper  2 tablespoons sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Smear the meat with the mustard.</p>
        <p>2. Mix the other ingredients and press evenly into the meat.</p>
        <p>3. Water-smoke for 3 to 4 hours. When the temperature reads 170, take the meat out.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Smoky Outdoor Salmon  This rub, adapted from Cook's Illustrated magazine, can be applied the night before or an hour before too, and is excellent for all sorts of oily fish, like bluefish and mackerel. It becomes crisp and delicious, and outside of eating it raw on the bone, I can't think of an easier preparation.</p>
        <p>12  1/2-pound salmon fillets, skin intact</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fennel seeds</p>
        <p>1/4 cup coriander seeds</p>
        <p>1/4 cup white (or any color) peppercorns  10 whole cloves.</p>
        <p>1. Grind all the ingredients, except the fish, in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle and rub the mixture onto the nonskin surface of the fillets.</p>
        <p>2. Water-smoke for an hour.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
