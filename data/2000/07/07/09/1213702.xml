        <p>As it enters the new millennium with restored can-do bravado, New York City has cut crime, welfare and taxes and added jobs and surpluses. New office towers are rising. City leaders are dreaming again, planning for a new stock exchange site, a new Pennsylvania Station, baseball stadiums, a train to the plane, even a Second Avenue subway.</p>
        <p>More than ever, it seems, this thriving city is a great place to live -- if only you could live here.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers are suffering in the grip of the worst housing shortage in decades, with soaring prices to match. That verdict is virtually unanimous among business and real estate executives, experts in academia, community leaders, planners, politicians and housing advocates.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has tried to move recently knows the problem firsthand. This is the reality of today's market:</p>
        <p>*Across the city, one in four households spends more than half its income on rent, the Census Bureau says. Vacancy rates are negligible. Adjusted for inflation, median renter income has increased 3 percent since 1975, while median rent has increased 33 percent. Middle-class people say they feel priced out of the market.</p>
        <p>*At the high end, the average cost of Manhattan co-ops and condominiums south of Harlem has broken the $700,000 barrier. Multimillion-dollar deals raise few eyebrows.</p>
        <p>*Overcrowding abounds, with families doubled up and immigrants squirreled away in illegal dwellings carved out of attics, basements and garages. The stock of rentals for less than $500 a month has shrunk by 55 percent in eight years.</p>
        <p>*At the lower rungs, the inflation-adjusted value of welfare's housing allowance has fallen more than half since 1975. The waiting list for public housing has 130,000 families; the list for rent vouchers has 215,000. On a typical night, shelters take in nearly 5,000 families and 7,000 single people.</p>
        <p>*Though demand for housing is rising, driven by population growth, especially immigration, and by more jobs, supply is not keeping pace. From 1981 to 1999, the city grew by 350,000 people but added only 42,000 rental apartments. The era of major construction is over: there is no recent parallel to Lefrak City or MetLife's Parkchester and Stuyvesant Town. From the modern peak of 60,000 new dwellings in 1963, annual production has slowed to a trickle. ''We celebrated when we passed the 10,000-unit mark last year, but in truth we should be building 30,000 or 40,000,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.</p>
        <p>Although nearly everyone agrees New York has a housing problem, there is no consensus on what to do. ''The real question is, what is the remedy?'' said Peter D. Salins, who has written and lectured extensively on housing. He has likened the apartment shortage to ''a vast game of musical chairs.''</p>
        <p>Edward S. Hochman, chairman of the city's Rent Guidelines Board, said, ''It's grim out there.'' At a recent meeting, the board heard the voices behind the statistics.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that rent was one week's salary, but I'm now dipping into my third week,'' said Vincenza Furst, 63, a working mother in a $1,200-a-month Greenwich Village apartment. ''I was born and bred here, I was married here and I raised my son here, but I may not be able to die here.''</p>
        <p>Today's shortage is a slow-motion crisis that has been long in the making and getting worse, two new reports conclude.</p>
        <p>The Coalition for the Homeless has issued ''Housing a Growing City: New York's Bust in Boom Times'' by Patrick Markee. The other study, ''Homeward Bound: A 21st Century Affordable Housing Agenda for New York,'' is being prepared for the Century Foundation and City University Graduate Center by Martha E. Stark of Baruch College and Doug Turetsky of United Neighborhood Houses.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' the coalition says, ''New York City enters the new century without a plan to house the next generation of New Yorkers.''</p>
        <p>For all the pessimism, ideas abound. Those who have them tend to fall into two camps: those who say government should step in, and those who say it is already meddling too much.</p>
        <p>Government Is the Problem</p>
        <p>Free-market proponents like Mr. Salins say New York's complicated rent laws are a root cause and should be abolished, a proposal that tenants' groups oppose.</p>
        <p>Other experts focus on cutting building costs. Or they call for streamlining the maze of municipal codes and the cumbersome approval process. Some hope for philanthropic help.</p>
        <p>New York's regulations are often called the nation's most complex. ''You've got to make it easier to build stuff,'' said Howard A. Husock, a housing expert at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. These critics call for simplifying rules on zoning, building, the environment, landmarks and access for the disabled and land review procedures that facilitate not-in-my-backyard resistance. They look approvingly to New Jersey, which has encouraged rehabilitation of old housing, exempting it from new-construction codes.</p>
        <p>Construction costs here are also the highest. ''My members will build if they can make a profit,'' said Mr. Spinola, the real estate board president. One academic study made 65 proposals to combat corruption, union rules and restrictive codes.</p>
        <p>Many experts insist that the city simply needs to find new places and ways to build, developing industrial zones, for example, allowing higher-density construction and redeveloping brown fields -- land that is polluted, but not with toxic waste -- the long-ignored waterfront, neglected neighborhoods and urban areas outside the city.</p>
        <p>''The entire middle class does not have to live in Manhattan south of 96th Street,'' said Michael H. Schill, director of New York University's real estate and urban policy center.</p>
        <p>Government Is the Solution</p>
        <p>But for all the talk of streamlining government and freeing up the market, many say the toughest hurdle to adequate housing is simply lack of money -- government money. They call for a broad thrust by government, through renewed construction, grants, vouchers, loans and tax breaks, like the deals made for corporate headquarters and the $255 million awarded to relocate the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Even some free-market advocates like Arthur Zabarkes, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, say government aid, like tax breaks, is vital. ''Without public help, I don't think it can be done,'' he said. Joseph Strasburg, president of the landlords' Rent Stabilization Association, said, ''Somebody has got to make up the difference between housing costs and what some people can afford.''</p>
        <p>Failing to relieve the shortage would be a strategic mistake, many experts say. ''There's no question that the long-term success of the city and this region would be seriously hampered,'' said H. Claude Shostal, president of the nonprofit Regional Plan Association. After polling major companies, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said last fall, ''The scarcity of housing and the high price is driving employers away and keeping new employers from coming.''</p>
        <p>The president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, Robert R. Kiley, said, ''Businesses eager to locate or expand here often go elsewhere and cite the lack of affordable housing.'' His group has become the city's largest builder of such dwellings.</p>
        <p>The city is bumping up against its debt limit and has rival needs like the schools, but housing advocates have their eyes on surpluses at every level. New York would get $337 million if the Federal Housing Administration devoted its $5 billion surplus to new housing, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development says.</p>
        <p>The Community Service Society wants to revive the pledge of Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to use hundreds of millions of dollars in Battery Park City revenues for housing.</p>
        <p>City and suburban officials have joined tenants to lobby Albany for more housing. The Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, have called for a trust fund. Others urge pension fund investments and help from giant foundations like Ford and Rockefeller.</p>
        <p>There is no question that government has cut back drastically. Spending by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has been down for years. New York State sponsored 125,000 middle-income Mitchell-Lama apartments through the 1970's, including Co-op City in the Bronx, but none since. Nor has the City Housing Authority built major new projects.</p>
        <p>It is a far cry from the 1980's, when legions of homeless people and the hulks of abandoned buildings intruded on the city's conscience, and housing took center stage. Mayor Koch and Governor Cuomo responded with a $5 billion program that provided tens of thousands of apartments.</p>
        <p>Then social issues fell out of favor. The public often equated housing programs with  ''dynamited high-rise hellholes,'' although New York has well-run public housing that has never needed demolition, said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition.</p>
        <p>''The housing crisis is in a new phase,'' said Jenny Laurie, director of the nonprofit Metropolitan Council on Housing. ''Wealthy people are gobbling up apartments, driving rents and prices sky-high. Middle- and low-income tenants are left to battle over the scarce crumbs.''</p>
        <p>Some say opinions seem to be shifting again. Working with Habitat for Humanity, the Rev. Dr. Thomas K. Tewell of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church said that the lack of housing ''is something that I believe breaks the heart of God.'' Archdeacon Michael S. Kendall, the housing chairman of the Commission of Religious Leaders of New York City, said the mayor and the governor had been receptive.</p>
        <p>And despite past retrenchment, many modest programs survive. ''The city and state have really come around in the last two years,'' said Donald A. Capoccia, a builder and a founder of the nonprofit New York State Association for Affordable Housing. But he conceded that the efforts were making only dents in the huge need.</p>
        <p>Recalling New York's responses to past housing challenges, Lewis Rudin, a developer for 53 years and chairman of the Association for a Better New York, said, ''We just need some enlightened, forward-looking political leadership.''</p>
        <p>It is a point the governor's housing commissioner, Joseph B. Lynch, would not dispute. ''Government,'' he said, ''may never again have the opportunity to address the housing crisis as effectively as it can in this era of economic expansion, record surpluses and unprecedented prosperity -- all of which, ironically, have contributed to the overheated housing market.''</p>
