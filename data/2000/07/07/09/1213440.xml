        <p>On my first summer job I learned to cheat.

        <p>On my first summer job I learned to cheat. I was working in one of those cute, old-timey ice cream shops where the sundaes are decorated with toothpick flags and the staff sings ''Happy Birthday'' to the customers.

        <p>Like millions of other American teenagers, I was doing what was expected of me that summer: preparing myself for the world of work by holding down a minimum-wage job that conveyed no special skills or knowledge but did breed a certain early cynicism. Like prom night and graduation, a summer job was a rite of passage in my town. Whether or not we needed the money or felt we had better uses for our time than topping off radiators at the mini-lube or repainting the foul lines on the city tennis courts, we teenagers labored straight through to Labor Day, emerging strengthened and toughened at summer's end.</p>
        <p>That was two decades ago, another time. These days, according to several recent reports, the summer-job tradition is in decline. Fewer and fewer kids, the experts tell us, are showing an interest in whiling away their holidays folding boxes and weed-whipping cracked sidewalks.</p>
        <p>What's more, the once-popular government programs that subsidized such jobs are drying up, the victims of a prosperous economy and a shrinking pool of applicants. A troubling development? Perhaps. Then again, if my own experience means anything, maybe not.</p>
        <p>Summer jobs are supposed to build character in teenagers -- the question is, What sort of character? A lot of the jobs, let's face it, are pure make-work: clearing dead-end trails through national forests, planting violets around school flagpoles. They're the sort of duties assigned to prison inmates and pensioners in the Soviet Union, and what they mainly teach is the necessity of appearing busy for the boss while doing something that no one really needs done. At the end of the week there's a paycheck, small but helpful, which you promptly pump into the gas tank of your car or blow on Christina Aguilera tickets. The jobs are entitlement programs, basically, or political schemes to keep rambunctious kids out of the way of adults and off the streets.</p>
        <p>Not that learning to look busy isn't valuable. One of my own summer jobs was moving books between two floors of a college library. My supervisor was barely in his 20's, a member of one of those upbeat New Age movements that preach prosperity through optimism. He called me and my coworkers his ''team'' and referred to our simple duties as ''the mission.'' What he failed to notice, though, in his zeal to convert us to his beliefs, was that, after only four weeks on the job, we'd finished moving every single book. There was no more to do, and two more months to do it. The team made a decision then: say nothing. The job was so easy and the pay so generous that we agreed to keep a good thing going. We emptied half of the shelves that we'd just filled, carried the books downstairs, and started over.</p>
        <p>Better training for corporate life would be hard to find. In that sense, the library job fulfilled its promise. I not only learned to work, I also learned when not to work. I learned to protect my friends and even my boss, who might have been laid off had someone realized that he'd fulfilled his objective prematurely. These lessons have come in handy ever since. In office after office, I've seen the price paid by those who complete assignments early, only to be handed yet more work in a continual, exhausting spiral that ends in hospitalization or unemployment. Such eager beavers tend to burn out early, perhaps because they never had summer jobs that taught them how to conserve their vital energy.</p>
        <p>The kids who are eschewing summer work in favor of more broadening pursuits like travel, athletics and daily moviegoing may find themselves at a disadvantage someday. There's so much they won't know. Like when to steal. I learned to steal while working at a gas station. I resisted at first, but my manager pushed hard, and since he was the nephew of the proprietor, I found him persuasive. The guy stole everything, from cans of Dr. Pepper to tanks of gas, explaining that they belonged not to the station but to a multinational oil company. What's more, he said, if I tattled to his uncle he'd blame me for the thefts. I'd lose my job.</p>
        <p>Summer work is important. Hop to it, kids. There are some things you just can't learn in school.</p>
