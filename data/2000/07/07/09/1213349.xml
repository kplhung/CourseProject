        <p>WERE it not for the events surrounding the 250th anniversary of Bach's death and for the recent, seemingly spontaneous surge of interest in Shostakovich's music, this would be Kurt Weill's year: not only the 50th anniversary of his death but also the centennial of his birth. As it is, plenty of Weill's often uncategorizable works have found their way into concert programs in New York and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But while a new recording of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets has appeared from Deutsche Grammophon to general acclaim, to say nothing of Teldec's huge project presenting all of Bach's music in a single box, it is taking longer for examples of Weill's art to be released on record this year. That dearth makes what is out even more noteworthy. Weill specialists will be particularly interested in an imminent ''Burgschaft,'' recorded live by EMI last year at Spoleto Festival U.S.A., conducted by Julius Rudel.

        <p>WERE it not for the events surrounding the 250th anniversary of Bach's death and for the recent, seemingly spontaneous surge of interest in Shostakovich's music, this would be Kurt Weill's year: not only the 50th anniversary of his death but also the centennial of his birth. As it is, plenty of Weill's often uncategorizable works have found their way into concert programs in New York and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But while a new recording of Shostakovich's 15 string quartets has appeared from Deutsche Grammophon to general acclaim, to say nothing of Teldec's huge project presenting all of Bach's music in a single box, it is taking longer for examples of Weill's art to be released on record this year. That dearth makes what is out even more noteworthy. Weill specialists will be particularly interested in an imminent ''Burgschaft,'' recorded live by EMI last year at Spoleto Festival U.S.A., conducted by Julius Rudel. Mainstream listeners may be more engaged by a new version of ''Die Dreigroschenoper,'' featuring the Frankfurt-based Ensemble Modern and a motley collection of soloists on RCA Victor.</p>
        <p>Weill and the polemical playwright Bertolt Brecht wrote ''Die Dreigroschenoper'' in 1928, basing their effort largely on John Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' a ballad opera of 1728. Most Americans know the work best in Marc Blitzstein's lively but hardly literal English adaptation, as ''The Threepenny Opera.''</p>
        <p>Like the original Berlin production (shut down by the Nazis in 1933), Blitzstein's translation enjoyed enormous success, running at the Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village from 1954 to 1961. What's more, the New York cast -- headed by Lotte Lenya, Weill's widow and a veteran of the initial German staging as well as a 1931 film of the show, directed by G. W. Pabst -- recorded an album that has become a touchstone (now on Polydor). Yet the Blitzstein edition, despite its considerable charms, bears an ersatz taint.</p>
        <p>Determining what constitutes an authentic ''Dreigroschenoper'' is, to be sure, no easy task. Weill and Brecht never sanctioned a complete version of the work, which Brecht often tinkered with over the years. He revised the libretto for a collection of his complete works in 1931, for example, to heighten the Marxist elements. And Weill's full score, which never entirely corresponded with his original piano-vocal score, was published only in 1972.</p>
        <p>What has come down intact is recordings, each staking its own claims. A collection of excerpts recorded in the late 1920's and originally issued by Telefunken remained available until the end of the 78 era and can now be heard on CD (Capriccio). And Lenya participated in a relatively complete German-language recording in 1958 (now on Sony Classical). More recently, John Mauceri conducted a performance for Decca /London's Entartete Musik series with the express purpose of recapturing the work's Weimar-era spirit.</p>
        <p>Now the RCA set (Red Seal 74321-66133-2; two CD's) brings a recording based on newly published scholarship of Stephen Hinton and Edward Harsh, which tries to reconcile Brecht's 1928 libretto with original stage scripts and band parts. But as Mr. Hinton points out in detailed notes accompanying this issue, ''the work is not synonymous with the event.'' In other words, no version of ''Die Dreigroschenoper,'' however authoritative, is likely to replicate exactly what audiences heard at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm on the night of the work's premiere.</p>
        <p>What makes this version compelling is not so much the welcome scholarship as the freewheeling spirit that pervades the performance. For that, listeners should thank H. K. Gruber, the Austrian composer and gleeful avant-gardist, who here not only conducts the Ensemble Modern but also sings the important role of J. J. Peachum. Mr. Gruber makes a wheezy, insinuating Peachum, infusing such familiar tunes as the ''Morning Hymn,'' the ''Why-Can't-They Song'' and the ''Song of the Insufficiency of Human Striving'' with matchless color.</p>
        <p>Some will take exception to hearing Nina Hagen, an eccentric German pop star, as Peachum's demanding wife. But by portraying Mrs. Peachum with unrelenting shrillness, Ms. Hagen relegates someone like the mezzo-soprano Helga Dernesch, in Mr. Mauceri's set, to plummy oblivion. Certainly unforgettable is Ms. Hagen's screechy take on ''The Ballad of the Prisoner of Sexuality'' (a song cut from the first production of ''Die Dreigroschenoper'' but included here because of its long association with the show).</p>
        <p>Prettier voices surface for Polly Peachum, Lucy Brown and Jenny, the role once taken by Lenya. All make favorable impressions, but listeners should note that things have changed since Mrs. Weill's day: ''Pirate Jenny,'' which Lenya took for her own in decades past, has lately been restored to Polly, for whom it was written. Here, Sona MacDonald lends the ballad bite and tenderness in a performance more varied and less mannered than Ute Lemper's for Mr. Mauceri. Memories of Lenya (as a soprano or, later, an alto), of course, remain indelible.</p>
        <p>For many, a ''Dreigroschenoper'' is only as good as its Macheath, and those so disposed will be especially pleased by the smooth crooning of Max Raabe, a popular German big-band leader, who has the measure of this seductive cad. In the ''Pimp's Ballad'' and the ''Ballad of Living in Style,'' Mr. Raabe is all coy charm, but he adopts a less flip tone for the ''Call From the Grave,'' a kind of ghoulish patter song. Mr. Raabe doubles as the Ballad Singer here and thus also delivers ''Moritat,'' the most famous of ''Dreigroschenoper'' songs.</p>
        <p>BUT what contributes most to making this version memorable is the playing of the Ensemble Modern. A chamber orchestra highly regarded for its recordings of music by John Adams and Steve Reich, the group displays a gratifying combination of idiomatic fervor and flawless musicianship in Weill. These virtues get a broader showcase with the inclusion of several orchestral interludes. Listen to the Hawaiian guitar in the ''Canon Song for Orchestra,'' for instance, or the mournful saxophones in ''The Love Song for Orchestra'' to hear just how superb these players are.</p>
        <p>With this ''Dreigroschenoper,'' Mr. Gruber and his colleagues give music lovers something special. They pull back the curtain of history to reveal an era when artistic possibilities seemed limitless, when two gifted men could produce a show, based on one 200 years earlier, that poked fun at convention but never erased sympathy for its protagonists. This recording lets us back into that world, to linger over a slinky clarinet line, an ironic shout and some clangorous percussion. It is a wonderful feeling.</p>
