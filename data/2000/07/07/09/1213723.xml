        <p>Teresa Weatherspoon stutter-stepped around two defenders and raced up the court, leaving the ferocious Debbie Black fuming behind in the trail of smoke.</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon easily found her teammate Tari Phillips slicing to the basket and when Phillips's layup dropped, giving her Liberty a safe 8-point lead over the visiting Miami Sol, Weatherspoon stretched her arms to the Madison Square Garden crowd and circled like an airplane coming in for a landing.</p>
        <p>Vintage Weatherspoon, a Women's National Basketball Association All-Star for the second straight season.</p>
        <p>On the night she was named the Eastern Conference's starting point guard for the July 17 All-Star Game, she gave her teammates the lift they needed when their energy level had plummeted, the fatigue of playing six games in nine nights gripping their legs. Her sixth assist of the night punctuated the Liberty's 11-point run with five minutes left in the game and propelled New York to a 63-51 triumph, its third straight victory.</p>
        <p>The streak put the Liberty (9-8) one game over .500 for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>''Everybody fought through being tired tonight,'' Weatherspoon said. ''We knew it was important to get going in the second half of the season and turn everything around.''</p>
        <p>Weatherspoon scored just 4 points, but she held Miami's leading scorer, Sheri Sam, to 7 points and threw off the pesky Black, who, at 5 feet 3 inches throws daggers with her eyes and body.</p>
        <p>While none of the Sol scored in double figures, the Liberty drew from the offense of Tamika Whitmore, who matched her career high with 17 points in her third start this season, and Vickie Johnson, who scored 7 of her 14 points down the stretch.</p>
        <p>But during the last seven minutes of the game, Weatherspoon was more than steady; she was exciting. ''It's such a simple little play,'' her teammate Sue Wicks said about the bounce pass to Phillips on the fast break. ''But it really got the crowd going and us going as well. We could get a little surge of energy.''</p>
        <p>After last night's game, Weatherspoon sat in front of her locker, her shoulder wrapped in a pack of ice. Her aching shoulder was the product of fighting through screens and denying Black any satisfaction.</p>
        <p>''I needed to find that juice again,'' Weatherspoon said. ''My teammates depend on me for that energy, to trash talk, to do what they expect of me.''</p>
        <p>The two-time defensive player of the year did that.</p>
        <p>''T-Spoon played tremendous defense tonight,'' Coach Richie Adubato said. ''She kept on coming. In the last four games, her intensity level has been back up to what it has been in the past.''</p>
        <p>While Weatherspoon was named an Eastern Conference starter in the  W.N.B.A. All-Star Game, the fans also voted in Wicks, the team's seventh-leading scorer. Wicks had 4 rebounds and 6 points, but pulled down one of the most important rebounds of the game with 3 minutes 33 seconds to play. She immediately dished out to Johnson, waiting beyond the arc, and Johnson sunk a 3-pointer as well as Miami, extending the Liberty's lead to 12 points.</p>
        <p>The first half was not as comfortable for New York, which took a 31-27 lead into the locker room. What the Liberty did, storming back on to the court to start the second half, however, defined the game. As well as one player.</p>
        <p>On the Liberty's first possession in the second half, Whitmore spun right, then left and calmly deposited a soft hook into the basket as if she were mailing an envelope. A minute later, she barreled into the lane on a fast break and finished with a clean, confident bank shot. That was the first of 6 unanswered points, as New York extended its lead to 11 points, its largest of the night.</p>
        <p>But the Sol came back , and former Liberty guard Kisha Ford hit two foul shots to cut the deficit to 2 points with 8:27 left to play. The New York players, who arrived in Manhattan just 5 hours before game time following their return from Friday night's triumph in Minnesota, were fighting the fatigue.</p>
        <p>Crystal Robinson played in pain most of the night, grimacing from her right shoulder sprain that had kept her out of Friday night's victory.</p>
        <p>Becky Hammon still had a groin pull that was bothering her.</p>
        <p>Phillips scored only 10 points after notching her eighth double-double Friday. The Liberty needed more than another body, and Weatherspoon stepped in at the right time.</p>
