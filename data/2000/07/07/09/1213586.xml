        <p>French, American and Pan-Latin From 14th Street to 19th Street</p>
        <p>BAMBOU  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 358-0012; 243 East 14th Street, between Second and Third Avenues; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards; dinner only.</p>
        <p>There is something otherwordly about Bambou. The food is careful, contemporary Caribbean and the lounge is cozy, filled with plants and plump sofas that make it as intimate as a private parlor. Appetizers include pumpkin ravioli with a coulis of spinach; crab cake over avocado butter, chive oil and balsamic molasses syrup; and steamed mussels floating in a special broth. Entrees include smoked pork chop, beet and watercress salad with beer-and-honey sauce; and grilled jerk-seasoned breast of chicken with avocado, rice and peas (Review: 10/11/96).</p>

        <p>BLUE WATER GRILL  *  [Rating: one star]  (212) 675-9500; 31 Union Square West, at 16th Street; $$; smoking on lower level; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>You get your money's worth here.  The menu lists all sorts of seafood in all sorts of styles, from straightforward fish house fare like steamed clams and fried calamari to elaborate dishes like porcini-crusted yellowfin tuna, portobello mushrooms, roast tomato and basil couscous in a shallot port wine sauce. Appetizers include lobster bisque; spicy tuna sushi roll; and crispy Point Judith calamari. Main dishes include five-spice Atlantic salmon with tempura rock shrimp, black rice and mandarin orange vinaigrette; ginger-soy lacquered Chilean sea bass, Chinese broccoli, sticky rice and wasabi vinaigrette; and blackened swordfish with sweet potato-crab meat hash  (Review: 8/9/96).</p>
        <p>CHICAMA  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 505-2233; 35 East 18th Street, at Broadway; $$$; smoking section; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This restaurant, which takes its name from a Peruvian coastal town, serves a splashy pan-Latin food that matches a raucous party mood. Starters include oven-baked empanada filled with spinach and smoked corn, with wild mushroom ceviche; grilled octopus with black olive sauce and quinoa with bacon; and Peruvian duck ceviche, marinated in orange and lime, with spicy duck liver spread and walnut-raisin crisp. Dinner entrees include roast suckling pig, with sour orange-garlic mojo, white rice, black beans and sweet plantains; and adobo-rubbed Argentine rib eye steak, with corn pudding, sliced tomatoes, oregano vinaigrette, sprinkled with Cabrales cheese. (Review: 4/12/00).</p>
        <p>MESA GRILL  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 807-7400; 102 Fifth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>If any restaurant has a right to slow down and show signs of fatigue, it's Mesa Grill, an instant hit on opening its doors in 1991 and still a downtown favorite. Under Bobby Flay, the chef, Mesa Grill is still alive and kicking. Appetizers include roasted cauliflower-green chili soup with goat cheese and blue corn taquito; spicy tuna tartare on a crisp hominy cake with avocado-red onion relish and hot sauce; and crispy blue-corn soft-shell crab salad with black pepper, ginger and lime sauce.  Entrees include Yucatan style halibut and littleneck clam pan roast with a green chili-coconut milk broth and caramelized onions; spice-crusted Black Angus sirloin with house  steak sauce and a double-baked horseradish potato with green onions and creme fraiche; and New Mexican spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chili sauce and sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter (Review: 5/24/00).</p>
        <p>TOCQUEVILLE  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 647-1515; 15 East 15th Street, between Fifth Avenue and Union Square West; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>In a small, trapezoidal room off Union Square, this French restaurant is a quiet haven of good taste, food and service. Appetizers include shucked Kumamoto oysters mignonette; creamless puree of white bean soup; and warm asparagus salad, brown butter and morels. Entrees include Taylor Bay scallop, mussel and cockle fricassee, with angel hair pasta, white wine and olive broth; sauteed fillet of steelhead salmon, sauteed apples, celeriac and wilted watercress, with horseradish beurre fondue; and pan roasted country chicken breast, ragout of baby artichokes, mushrooms and fingerling potatoes (Review: 5/3/00).</p>
        <p>VERBENA  **  [Rating: two stars]  (212) 260-5454; 54 Irving Place, between 17th and 18th Streets; $$$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The room is elegant and beautifully lighted. The food, by Diane Forley,  chef and owner, is original American fare. Starters include duck confit ravioli with mushrooms and goat cheese; mission figs with prosciutto and grated Roquefort; and foie gras terrine with melon chutney and brioche toast. Main dishes include halibut with artichokes, sun-dried tomatoes and parmesan broth; Maine lobster with fava bean polenta, baby zucchini and chamomile butter; and baby rack of lamb with green split pea mash and braised endive and rosemary (Review: 11/25/94; New York Today: April 1998).</p>
