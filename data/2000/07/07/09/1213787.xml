        <p>Becoming Madame Mao</p>
        <p>By Anchee Min.</p>
        <p>337 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company. $25.</p>
        <p>No other woman has come as close to running modern China as Jiang Qing, the late wife of Chairman Mao Zedong, and no other woman in 20th-century China had such an extraordinary rise and fall as Jiang. In the late 1970's, she went from being one of the most powerful figures in her country to a convict who would live the rest of her days in prison, reviled by the Chinese people.</p>
        <p>In ''Becoming Madame Mao,'' Anchee Min takes what is known of Jiang Qing's life and spins a tantalizing tale of how this second-rate actress was abandoned by her parents, swung from one romance to another and finally journeyed to Mao's Communist base in central China and sang her way into his heart.</p>
        <p>In prose that is simple, searing, poetic and also at times overdramatic, Min tries to give a fuller portrait of a woman many people today think of as profoundly sinister and fantastically ambitious. The result is a disturbing but appealing book: it paints a sympathetic picture of someone who persecuted countless innocent people to death, yet Jiang has become such a caricature of evil that it is interesting to see her sketched as a human being and introduced in a vaguely positive light.</p>
        <p>Min's second novel -- she also wrote the well-received autobiography ''Red Azalea'' -- opens a few moments before Madame Mao takes her own life in prison. Jiang Ching, as Min renders her name, is talking to her daughter, a soft-minded, trembly woman whom Jiang sees as her saddest failing in life.</p>
        <p>The novel then reels back to Jiang's earliest memory, her first brush with pain at 4 years old, when her mother takes a long white cloth and begins wrapping Jiang's tiny feet around and around. ''The mother doesn't tell her that by the time her feet are released they will look like triangle-shaped rice cakes with toenails curled under the sole,'' the narrator says, adding that Jiang smiles after her feet are wrapped up and calls them ''elephant legs.'' Then the pain comes and, in her first act of defiance, Jiang rips off the ''smelly binding strips'' and throws them in front of her mother.</p>
        <p>Yunhe (Jiang Ching's name as a child) has a grim upbringing, as Min recounts it -- and the tale seems mostly embroidered history rather than fabricated from whole cloth. She watches as her mother is beaten by her father, and in the end she is raised by her grandfather. He does something that shapes the delicate Yunhe for the rest of her life: he introduces the girl to traditional Chinese operas. She dreams about the characters in the ancient tales, the rebellions, the women who fight fiercely for their happiness and get it. She decides that she will become an opera actress and live a heroine's life onstage. Yunhe then antagonizes her grandfather by running away to join a theater troupe, and wins modest acclaim when the leading lady becomes ill and she takes over the role because she is the only other actress who has memorized all the lines.</p>
        <p>Yunhe suffers through her first marriage, with a husband who makes her feel like ''an animal on a slaughtering table''; she gets divorced and then falls in love with her first Communist, joins the party and cheats on her husband. In Shanghai before the revolution, she is detained, thrown into prison and is released only after she signs a document denouncing Communism. It is an act that comes to haunt her later on, as Min tells us in a flash-forward that tries to link Jiang's earlier and later lives. It is precisely such moments in the book, however, where the events of that life seem to be put together like beads on a string rather than synthesized into a complete picture. Sometimes it's hard to grasp her transformation from confused actress to ambitious manipulator.</p>
        <p>Jiang first encounters Mao when she travels to Yenan, where the Communists are building a new base. She writes an article that criticizes bourgeois art and attracts his attention; ultimately he falls in love with this beautiful and flirtatious young woman, and over the objections of other Communists, he marries her.</p>
        <p>The Communists triumph and Mao becomes China's chairman. Mao and Jiang move together into the Forbidden City, where Mao can't get used to the modern toilets and Jiang, increasingly isolated both from his world of politics and from ordinary people, feels as though she is ''left alone with all these treasures.'' She slowly seeps into a kind of madness, takes morphine and begins to spy on Mao, who sleeps around with different mistresses and contracts syphilis. As Mao begins to realize that ''running a country is not like winning a guerrilla war,'' he starts to withdraw, and their relations become icy. When she finally sees him on one occasion, ''his face is a smeared drawing -- there aren't any clear lines.''</p>
        <p>During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang earned her nickname, the White-Boned Demon, taking glory in wiping out her enemies, sending her former critics to their deaths. While Min shows this side of Jiang, she often eclipses extraordinary historical events -- such as the Great Leap Forward, which caused famines that left some 30 million people dead from starvation -- by keeping the soap opera of Jiang's life in the foreground.</p>
        <p>MANY historians have written about how Jiang supported Mao and his Cultural Revolution by building her own cultural bureaucracy, which shaped the nation's propaganda with revolutionary operas, films and plays. In her novel, Min tries to depict the historical backdrop through shifting narration that maneuvers between Jiang's perspective and a more all-knowing narrator. But Min also takes a liberal interpretation of certain key incidents. For instance, in recounting the death in 1971 of Lin Biao, Mao's defense minister and chosen successor, she relies on an account, now discredited, that suggests that Mao had him murdered as he left a dinner party. Lin's demise remains a puzzle, but the more accepted view today is that he died in an airplane crash as he tried to escape after being caught in a coup attempt.</p>
        <p>Readers who remember the hundreds of thousands of people who died during the Cultural Revolution may wince at ''Becoming Madame Mao,'' seeing it as the moral equivalent of a sympathetic portrayal of Hitler. But then again, this is a novel, not a historical assessment. And what renders it compelling and penetrating is precisely its empathy for a woman normally thought of as inhumanly evil.</p>
