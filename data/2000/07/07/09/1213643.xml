        <p>Two County Jail correction officers, Bradley Belcher and Yvette Washington, have pleaded guilty to narcotics charges in Federal District Court in White Plains. They were arrested in April on complaints that both officers received bribes in exchange for delivering contraband, including alcohol and what was claimed to be heroin, to a federal inmate housed at the jail. According to the complaints, the officers received cash ranging from $150 to $300. The officers supervised between 75 and 100 federal inmates. The charges were brought after a 13-month joint investigation by, among others, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Westchester County District Attorney's Office. The complaints charged that a federal inmate cooperating with law enforcement officers helped arrange meetings between the correction officers and a person outside the jail who was purportedly the inmate's relative but who in reality was an undercover agent.</p>
