        <p>The Name of</p>
        <p>the World</p>
        <p>By Denis Johnson.</p>
        <p>129 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $22.</p>
        <p>The jacket of Denis Johnson's new novel displays what might be a road or a set of railroad tracks disappearing into a whited-out middle distance. The road out of town has always been a major element in Johnson's work. His characters -- often drifters, self-educated intellectual outlaws, vagabond poets -- take their places beside the Old Highway in the dew-scented dawn or the early morning rain. Down the road ahead they find runic messages, brief encounters charged with elusive significance, random violence, masked providence. ''The Name of the World'' is, in some ways, a departure for Johnson in that its protagonist is a relatively solid citizen. Circumstance, however, has rendered him just one more uncertain counter in life's brutal Snakes and Ladders. He becomes yet another traveler on the American Road, that eternally recurring model for life, celebrated, lyricized and deplored by so many American authors in the years since World War II.</p>
        <p>The narrative line of a novel can be usefully compared to vehicles of locomotion. An American novel of the Road School is a Chevy on the freeway out of San Berdoo, the lounge on some surviving cross-country train, a pink-and-fuchsia bumper car in a weirdly lighted fun house. Driving, or simply carried along, is a point-of-view character, often paralyzed before the prospect of action but equipped with a sensibility that turns cleareyed witness into poetry. ''The Name of the World'' is a novel of that nature.</p>
        <p>Riding the narrative line here is a character called Michael Reed. Reed is a former high school teacher who once found himself working for a right-wing Oklahoma senator in Washington. Now he's an adjunct professor of history at a Middle Western university. Informing his situation and crippling his will is the trauma of a tragedy he suffered a few years before. His much-beloved wife and daughter perished in a road accident, and he's already having trouble bringing their features to his recollection. Only the ache of lost love remains; childless and mostly celibate, he lives out the terms of his university appointment.</p>
        <p>One evening Michael goes to a dinner party honoring a distinguished visitor to campus. Colleagues have arranged the invitation; since Michael's appointment ends in a year there's hope he will cultivate the acquaintance of a foundation director with a possible job offer. At the party, Reed makes the meet that's meant to advance his fortunes. He also casts an eye on two interesting women. One is Heidi Franklin, an art historian whom he observes to be as homely as himself and whom he resolves to later hit upon. The other, whose name escapes him, is a cellist, an impertinent young smarty-pants who gets attractively tipsy. She's a redhead with big blue eyes, and, revealed by her daring matching blue dress, her ivory shoulders flush enticingly.</p>
        <p>Down the road of academia goes Mike Reed's observant sensibility. He has lunch with Dr. Stein, the foundation director, and learns there's no appointment for him. But the lunch reminds him of the sad ending to Stein's marriage. Under the eyes of the entire campus, the doctor's beautiful wife has been stolen by an arrogant (and commercially copped out) Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist.</p>
        <p>As things proceed, Heidi the art historian is forgotten. In the fine arts department, Reed rather blunders into an exhibition of performance art. The young cellist, whose name turns out to be Flower Cannon, is shaving her private parts, an unaccompanied solo. Flower occurs in various roles throughout the novel; she's a kind of good bad girl, the archetypal ambiguous female of desire. When Reed goes gambling on one of the Midwest's dry riverboats, he recognizes Flower under her working moniker of O. O. O'Malley. She's improbably believable, one of the book's finer creations.</p>
        <p>As we bump along the track in Johnson's sometimes incongruously coupled boxcars, we're riding through a spare landscape, scenery to which the much-misapplied term ''minimalist'' can pretty accurately apply. Transitions are rocky and the view can be dim. At other times, Johnson's unique lyricism lights up his book's interior world. The conversation between two bootblacks, the cool rap of a casino bus driver, suddenly impart a jazzy sophistication to the narrative.</p>
        <p>In the blackjack parlor, Reed picks up with a thug called Vince. He finds himself ''vomiting up . . . cruel vulgarities'' to match his drinking buddy's coarse routine. ''Vince got louder as he drank another round, and then another. I didn't know what he was saying. I listened while peering mainly at his eyebrows. Every now and then I answered. It was the kind of barroom conversation in which two people talk at cross-purposes until, sometimes anyway, one punches the other one.'' The scene has a dreary authenticity that triggers grim recognition.</p>
        <p>At times, a character's speculation comes forth in passages that, for good or ill, might have been written by Jack Kerouac himself. Here, Reed listens to a church choir:</p>
        <p>''I didn't think often about that which people called God, but for some time now I'd certainly hated it, this killer, this perpetrator, in whose blank silver eyes nobody was too insignificant, too unremarkable, too innocent and small to be overlooked in the parceling out of tragedy. I'd felt this all-powerful thing as a darkness and weight. Now it had vanished. A tight winding of chains had burst. Someone had unstuck my eyes. A huge ringing in my head had stopped. This is what the grand and lovely multitude of singers did to me.''</p>
        <p>Other passages remind us that Denis Johnson is an accomplished poet as well as a novelist. His specialty is the fashioning of a delirious, headlong poetry on the gritty realities of American hard times. Rough-edged at times in this novel, it still casts a native spell:</p>
        <p>''I got it into gear and onto the Old Highway and drove east, running away from the sunlit rim of the plains. I wasn't traveling fast, not at first, but the rows of cultivation whipped quickly by, and in the dizzying exactness of their changing perspective they turned and opened and closed again as I shot down the middle of the fields. I accelerated but I still felt as if I had stepped wrong and was plunging backward. Like the rider on an amusement, I had that strange satisfaction that it was all designed to be scary, to be fun, and would soon be over. I wondered if that meant I was going to die. . . . The sun had set but the fields were soaked with light in the dusk. I wanted to stagger to the shore of this mindless iridescence and throw into it my most beloved thing, my very favorite thing. When I'd worn myself out going too fast, I pulled into the roadside weeds. I stopped the car in the middle of the round shimmering table of the earth. Meanwhile the dusk wouldn't die.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Kerouac, Johnson is no stranger to irony. In his early novel ''Angels'' he provided us with one inimitable conceit: the notion of Wallace Stevens's line from ''Sunday Morning,'' ''Death is the mother of beauty,'' inscribed over the gas chamber in the New Mexico state penitentiary. Eros and Thanatos on death row? It's a cruel and bitter joke but, when you think about it, neither flip nor irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''The Name of the World'' extends its narrative line from a ragged Middle Western campus to the graffiti-webbed tunnels of Amtrak to the islands of the Aegean. It closes at the borders of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, as Mike Reed (like Denis Johnson) covers Operation Desert Storm. The world rushing by is sometimes imperfectly realized, sometimes bleak, occasionally luminous. Still, there's no doubt about the power of this writer's vision.</p>
