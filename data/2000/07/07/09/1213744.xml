        <p>Under a nearly cloudless sky, a blue Pontiac Grand Am with a Yankees pennant, carrying William Kotoff and his wife, Letty, pulled into a Shea Stadium parking lot before yesterday's first game. A few paces behind them, a silver two-door sedan with a Mets cap in the back and Letty Kotoff's parents, Richie and Toni Bujan, in the front seat, slid into a nearby parking space.</p>
        <p>The gloves were off and family niceties were set aside.</p>
        <p>''It's her choice; it's her husband's choice,'' Mr. Bujan, a gray-haired Met fan from Sayreville, N.J., said of his daughter's team, while resting on the side of his car. ''He's my son-in-law, and I am stuck with him.''</p>
        <p>As they sat on their cars, drinking beer and eating hot dogs and potato salad, his son-in-law, William Kotoff, seemed a little more typical of the split families who came to the first of two Mets-Yankees games yesterday.</p>
        <p>''For as long as I can remember, there has been a rivalry,'' Mr. Kotoff said. ''We hate each other on the field, but off the field, we love each other.''</p>
        <p>For many of those gathered, the interleague game pitted friend against friend, father against son and husband against wife. But as city officials worried about logistics and security, many families and groups of friends used yesterday as a chance -- never mind the bickering, goading and bragging that goes along with a strong rivalry -- to come together in some meaningful ways.</p>
        <p>Angelo Figueroa Sr., 40, and his son, Angelo Jr., 11, hardly ever go to baseball games. But yesterday, they were in field-level seats at Shea, watching as the Yankees beat the Mets, 4-2. The father grew up in Queens, so it comes as little surprise that he roots for the Mets. The son was attracted to the Yankees, who have been winning for most of his life.</p>
        <p>''I grew up a Mets fan, but I let him make his own choices,'' Mr. Figueroa said knowingly, glancing at his son, who was wearing a Yankees cap and jersey. ''Look what happened.''</p>
        <p>''Our relationship is better because we are both huge baseball fans,'' a woman from a split family, who declined to give her name, said. It seemed to be a common theme throughout the day, with many saying that their love of the game overrode their dislike for the other team's followers.</p>
        <p>Phil Calise, 18, a Met fan, took his 11-year-old sister, Danielle, a Yankees fan, to the game at Shea. ''My grandparents got mad at me,'' Danielle, who lives with her brother in Jackson, N.J., complained, recalling a recent breakfast. Mr. Calise said his sister was only a Yankees fan because she thought Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop, was cute. ''Hot,'' Danielle corrected him.</p>
        <p>The day did have its odd moments. One of those came during the first game, when Ronald Witenburg, of Chelsea, and his son, Marc, stepped up to a souvenir stand as if they were at the wrong stadium, complaining that Shea officials were not selling any Yankees merchandise.</p>
        <p>Michael Byrne, 28, and Mike Postilio, 25, with a Mets jacket around his waist, have been best friends since they were barely big enough to get their hands around a baseball.</p>
        <p>They were neighbors on Long Island, where their parents still live, but when it came to sports, they occupied different worlds.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like our relationship depends on how your team is doing,'' Mr. Byrne said, adjusting his Yankees cap. ''You're always friends, but there's a much higher chance for an argument when the Yankees are in first place and the Mets are going down the tank and vice versa. The fuses get much shorter.''</p>
        <p>Their comments were a mirror of the reception the teams' buses got when they arrived at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' bus arrived to the boos of Met fans. As the bus carrying the Mets arrived, Yankees' fans lined the streets booing and chanting: ''Go back home -- to Queens.''</p>
        <p>Yankee Stadium seemed a more hostile place to Met fans than Shea did to Yankees partisans, even before the Yankees took a commanding 4-2 lead that they never surrendered.</p>
        <p>''I don't give no one trouble up here. We're civilized. We're human beings around here,'' said Mets fan Michael Miller, 23, of Queens. ''But in the Bronx,'' he said, reliving his last trip, where he was insulted and harassed, ''they're animals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller's cousin, Yankees fan Stanley Zileo, agreed.</p>
        <p>'Yeah, baby, and we're proud of it,'' Mr. Zileo said.</p>
