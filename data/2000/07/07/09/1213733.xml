        <p>The Clinton administration will postpone the first federal execution since 1963. A convicted murderer, Juan Raul Garza, is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, but the White House, citing concerns about the fairness of the death penalty and the absence of clemency procedures, is awaiting Justice Department regulations on how inmates on death row should seek clemency.</p>
        <p>The regulations should be completed within a couple of weeks, said a Justice Department spokesman. They will provide for the lawyers of those sentenced to death to make oral presentations before a clemency panel.</p>
