        <p>A LONG ISLAND radio feud spilled into public view recently over the promotion of yesterday's concert by Blue Oyster Cult and Zebra.</p>
        <p>WBAB-FM (102.3), the Babylon-based rock station, can claim historic franchise to the two bands. Besides playing their music, Bob Buchmann, who had been a morning disk jockey for 20 years and was vice president of programming, helped secure Zebra's recording contract with Atlantic.</p>
        <p>But WBAB was not involved in the promotion of the concert. Mr. Buchmann left the station last November after it hired Kim Guthrie, a former newswoman from Iowa, as general manager.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchmann is now at WAXQ, which won the bid to sponsor the show at the Vanderbilt in Plainview.  WBAB refused to co-promote the concert.</p>
        <p>''It's silly, crazy, it's just ludicrous to think we should promote that show,'' Ms. Guthrie said. ''No radio station would advertise a concert sponsored by a competing radio station.''</p>
        <p>That is not true, said Dave Glicker, director of Strong Island Events, a promotion company affiliated with WLIR and the Vanderbilt.</p>
        <p>''A good radio station will always service their listeners and never turn down money,'' Mr. Glicker said.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Buchmann left WBAB, WAXQ has, in the latest Arbitron ratings, virtually tied with WBAB (new ratings will be released in mid-July) and has beat WBAB among men between 25 and 54. But the most recent Arbitron trends, which are far from official, appear to predict a strong rise for WBAB.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchmann, 43, who grew up in Bay Shore and Dix Hills, lives in Smithtown with his wife and two children. After graduating from Ithaca College (majoring in communications), the aspiring disk jockey, who idolized radio personalities like Don Imus and Dan Ingram, returned to Long Island and landed his first radio job at WRCN.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Buchmann arrived at WBAB in 1979, the station had a meager 1.1-share rating, and within the year, the 3,000-watt station (it is now 6,000, compared with WAXQ's 50,000) beat the Long Island station WLIR and the Manhattan station WPLJ.</p>
        <p>In 1998 Cox Radio, based in Atlanta, bought WBAB from Chancellor Broadcasting (the station had been bought eight times before 1998).</p>
        <p>''That's when the storm clouds started rolling in,'' Mr. Buchmann said.</p>
        <p>In June 1998, Ms. Guthrie was brought in for her first job as general manager.</p>
        <p>After a year of conflicts, Mr. Buchmann decided to leave. ''Late in the summer of '99, I took a look at the ratings,'' he said. ''We were flying as high as you can fly, making a ton of money, we were at our peak. I said to myself, 'Go out while you are on top.' ''</p>
        <p>Kim Guthrie, 38, had arrived from KSTP-FM in Minneapolis, where she was general sales manager. Her boss there, Ginny Morris, said, that while ''Kim doesn't suffer fools easily'' or ''have tolerance for those who don't share her vision,'' she was ''very smart and did a remarkable job.'' She said Ms. Guthrie was well-liked by her staff, although not always by her peers.</p>
        <p>A former WBAB employee, Conrad Trautmann, an engineer who left for Westwood One Radio Network, said, ''Of all the general managers I've worked for she would rank No. 1.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guthrie was determined to improve WBAB and shake up the status quo. ''She did some things wrong,'' said Mr. Glicker. ''When you come in town from out of town, you've got to make some friends and be diplomatic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchmann said, ''It was my feeling that she was planning on making the station her own.'' Ms. Guthrie was the first WBAB general manager who was not from Long Island.</p>
        <p>In October 1999, Mr. Buchmann left for WAXQ, which covers a large metropolitan area including most of Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guthrie, who moved her husband and three daughters to St. James, questions whether Mr. Buchmann can serve 18 counties without Long Island suffering. ''You can't,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Buchmann, she said: ''We wanted him to stay. He chose to leave Long Island radio. We anticipated quite a backlash. Do you know how many calls there were? Zero.''</p>
        <p>Judy Dillon, who was Mr. Buchmann's assistant at WBAB and has since followed him to WAXQ, said: ''That's a downright lie. I was the one who answered the phone and took all the e-mails and read the letters. There were hundreds of calls, letters and e-mails. A lot of people were very upset about him leaving. And many of those people have followed him to Q.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guthrie wondered, ''Did he really think 250,000 listeners would leave with him?'' In the period after Mr. Buchmann departure, WBAB's December ratings dropped to 3.3. It has since risen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guthrie eventually decided to clean house, a move many new managers make. Some former employees said they did not like the way she did that.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dillon said Ms. Guthrie had become ''arbitrary'' and ''deceitful.'' But former employees, like Mr. Trautmann and Stephanie Hansen of KSTP, say that is not the Kim Guthrie they know.</p>
        <p>Eric Wellman, WBAB's former operations manager said: ''Things were going well, and suddenly, out of the clear blue, she called four of us into her office and fired us. We were asked to leave immediately because we would ruin the morale of the other workers. Believe me, their morale was already ruined.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Guthrie said: ''I'm not hated here. I'm one of the guys.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wellman, who says he learned radio from Mr. Buchmann, is now an assistant program director and music director at WAXQ.</p>
        <p>Two other people fired in what Mr. Wellman referred to as a ''bloodbath'' were Gerry Martire, a popular disk jockey who had been at the station for 18 years, and Steve Morris, the promotions director who had been at the station for 11 years.</p>
        <p>''There were people there who just weren't good,'' Ms. Guthrie said. ''I had to clean house.</p>
        <p>''Am I demanding? Yes. Do I have high standards? Yes. Have I gotten great results? Yes. Does it go over well? Maybe not.</p>
        <p>''I had a big job ahead of me. I had to move a heritage station forward.''</p>
        <p>One thing she did was cut advertising to make more time for music.</p>
        <p>''People listen to radio for the music, not the D.J.'s,'' she said. ''WBAB is now in the best shape its ever been, we are at our all-time highest billing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchmann credited her for ''doing a wonderful job with advertising billing.'' Many radio stations, however, are currently enjoying a peak period.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the zingers just keep on coming. ''Listen,'' Ms. Guthrie said, ''I've always taken the high road about this, but one man does not make a radio station. An ex-morning show host doesn't make a radio station.''</p>
        <p>''I couldn't agree more,'' Mr. Buchmann said. ''It's the listeners that makes the radio station, and that's our formula for success.''</p>
