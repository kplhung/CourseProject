        <p>Dwight Gooden, a familiar name but a wholly unexpected hero of the day, was asked between games of the most novel baseball doubleheader in nearly a century how he liked the idea of playing two games in two ballparks in two New York boroughs on the same day.</p>

        <p>Dwight Gooden, a familiar name but a wholly unexpected hero of the day, was asked between games of the most novel baseball doubleheader in nearly a century how he liked the idea of playing two games in two ballparks in two New York boroughs on the same day.</p>
        <p>''Me, personally, I like it,'' Gooden, the former Met who is the Yankees' newest pitcher, said yesterday. ''I'm a fan of the game. I know some of the players probably don't like it as much. But those players haven't been sitting home for three and a half weeks either, so for me, if we were playing three or four games today, I'd be O.K. with that.''</p>
        <p>So, obviously, would New York baseball fans, 109,986 of whom attended the doubleheader. Most of the fans saw only one of the games, either the one in the afternoon at Shea Stadium in Queens or the one at night at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. Many more would have liked to have seen both games, and some would have been in baseball heaven if a third game could have been thrown in.</p>
        <p>But Ebbets Field no longer stands in Brooklyn and the Polo Grounds disappeared from Upper Manhattan long ago. You would have to look deep into baseball's past, to 1903, to find a similar doubleheader, when the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Superbas played in the morning in Brooklyn and in the afternoon in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was a festive day in New York, tarnished for Mets fans by the outcome of the games, a pair of 4-2 Yankees victories, and by the Roger Clemens pitch in the second inning of the second game that hit Mike Piazza, the Mets' best player, on the head and knocked him out of the game. The Mets said he had a slight concussion.</p>
        <p>The Mets, led by Manager Bobby Valentine, were livid over the Clemens pitch. ''I've seen him hit guys in the head before,'' an angry but measured Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, on the other hand, acted surprised that anyone would think Clemens hit Piazza deliberately. ''Mike hasn't had a hit in the series,'' the Yankees' manager said. ''We're not about to stir it up.''</p>
        <p>Clemens himself denied that he hit Piazza purposely. ''Mike has hit me well,'' he said. ''That's not the way I wanted to get him out.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees won the game at the Mets' park first. Gooden, who had been discarded earlier this season by the Houston Astros and then by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, pitched a strong five innings, getting the victory in his first game in six years at Shea Stadium, the site he called home for 11 years.</p>
        <p>When the 3-hour-16-minute game ended at 4:37 p.m., those fans among the 54,165 at Shea who were fortunate to have tickets for both games began their journey to the Bronx, where 55,821 saw another Yankees victory.</p>
        <p>Officials of both clubs said the number of ticket-holders for both games had to be fewer than some had estimated -- one estimate said a third -- because both games had been sold out before the doubleheader was created because of a rainout at Yankee Stadium on June 11.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had also defeated the Mets less than 18 hours earlier, in the series opener Friday night at Shea. And the Mets encountered further difficulties yesterday.</p>
        <p>On the very first play of the afternoon game, Valentine was ejected by the umpire Robb Cook after a dispute over a base-running play.</p>
        <p>Then, in the second inning of the game at Yankee Stadium, the Mets' Piazza was forced from the game.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won the first game after breaking a 2-2 tie on a home run by Tino Martinez in the sixth inning.  A reliever was already warming up to replace Gooden when Martinez homered. Gooden allowed the Mets only six hits, one walk and two runs, and three relievers shut out the Mets the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>Then it was off to the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The two-game fans chose different means of transportation to travel what by automobile is the 10-mile distance between the ballparks. Some who chose to drive encountered a traffic backup on the Grand Central Parkway about 5:30 p.m. because a cab had broken down just before La Guardia Airport. Another backup occurred at the tollbooths at the end of the Triborough Bridge leading to the Major Deegan Expressway, the most direct way to Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>One driver opted to avoid the toll backup and took the Manhattan ramp instead, he said, then had some difficulty getting to the Macombs Dam Bridge leading to the Stadium. He stopped, however, and found helpful pedestrians on 155th Street near Eighth Avenue who steered him in the right direction. He arrived for the night game two hours ahead of time.</p>
        <p>Other fans took -- what else? -- the subway as their link to the games of the Subway Series. Riding the No. 7 train from Willets Point to Grand Central Terminal, then changing to the No. 4 train to Yankee Stadium, these fans were jammed into the subway cars but encountered no problems other than some sweat.</p>
        <p>Fans of the two teams spent much of their two-train ride needling each other good-naturedly. Obviously, Yankees fans had the upper hand.</p>
        <p>''It is pretty incredible,'' Mark Mazzara, 27, a Mets fan from Bayside, Queens, said on the platform of the No. 7 train after watching the first game and before attending the second. ''It's great for New York, and it's great for baseball.''</p>
        <p>A little more than an hour after they boarded the train across from Shea, the fans arrived for the second half of their scintillating day.</p>
        <p>Both teams traveled in buses with police escorts. The Yankees' ride took only 14 minutes, aided by police who stopped traffic.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have a car on the road,'' Andy Pettitte, a Yankees pitcher, said. ''We had a presidential escort today.''</p>
