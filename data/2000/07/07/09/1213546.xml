        <p>DO not be put off by how eye-glazingly abstruse the subject sounds: A bill making its way through Congress to change how government-sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are regulated could, if enacted, have some profound effects on the portfolios of millions of ordinary investors.</p>
        <p>Never mind the legislative details. The Main Street bottom line is this: The agencies' bonds may stop being regarded as an almost perfect equivalent to ultrasafe Treasury bonds at a time when the supply of real McCoy Treasuries is contracting sharply. Such a change would be hugely disruptive to bond mutual funds.</p>
        <p>More than one-fifth of all assets in government bond funds -- $26.5 billion worth -- are actually Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt, according to the most recent data from Morningstar Inc. Taxable bond funds keep one-eighth of their assets, or $65.5 billion, in these issues; pension funds and 401(k) plans also hold big chunks. The two agencies' total outstanding debt of $908 billion has always been treated as if it were entirely risk-free, since the Treasury was sure to prevent any default.</p>
        <p>Now Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, is pushing a bill to put much more distance between the agencies and the taxpayer. While it would not push the agencies entirely from under the government's wing -- they would keep their exemptions from taxes and security registration rules, for example -- the bill would call into question the implicit government guarantee of their bonds that Wall Street has always believed in. Without their special status embodied in current law, the bonds may suddenly be off limits to many current holders.</p>
        <p>Under current regulations, for example, banks can hold unlimited amounts of the bonds. Government figures cited by Mr. Baker show that more than 4,000 banking institutions have more money invested in them than they have capital -- a concentration that would be considered unacceptably risky if not for the agencies' unimpeachable credit. No administration could permit a default, the thinking has always been, if so many banks would be imperiled.</p>
        <p>But the bill calls on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board to study banks' agency bond holdings, which totaled $210 billion in mid-1999, and to consider imposing limits. If the banks are forced to reduce their holdings, or merely to stop being active buyers, the bottom could fall out of the agency bond market. Others, like money market funds, that may hold only the safest, most liquid securities may also have to sell.</p>
        <p>If the selling trend develops, the ripple effects may be broad. Banks and other holders forced to dump the bonds may have to scramble to find enough Treasury securities to replace them, heating up demand in an already tightening market. Meanwhile, as agency bonds lose favor and their yields rise, they may crowd out high-quality corporate issues or depress their prices.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Baker acknowledged that changes caused by his bill, if imposed abruptly, could be disruptive; he said he would recommend they be phased in over several years.</p>
        <p>THE bill would also repeal the Treasury's authority to buy up to $2.25 billion in agency debt. This liquidity facility, as it is known, was meant to ensure that the agencies could obtain funds in a crunch. It has never been used, and may no longer be enough to matter much in a crisis, but its symbolic importance is great.</p>
        <p>The agencies' top-of-the-scale credit ratings would not immediately be threatened by the bill, according to officials at the two big credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's. And Mr. Baker said he believed that if the agencies remained well managed, their ratings would stay high. Nonetheless, the door to a future downgrade would be opened.</p>
        <p>Stanislas Rouyer, a senior analyst at Moody's, pointed out that the agencies' standing grew out of the deep and intertwined relationships with the government that the bill is intended to curtail. And Michael DeStefano, who follows the agencies for Standard &amp; Poor's, said any signal from Congress that it intended to expose the agencies to more market discipline could erode their special status in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>A change in the agencies' credit ratings ''would roil the whole fixed-income market,'' said Scott Mather, an executive vice president of Pacific Investment Management, a money management firm. ''There'd be so many portfolio readjustments,'' Mr. Mather added. ''There are a lot of high-quality funds that just own agency debt.''</p>
        <p>But even if the bill passes, Mr. Mather said, a downgrade for the agencies is very unlikely. ''They are just too big and too important to have that happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Jeffers, a Fannie Mae spokesman, is concerned that the bill jeopardizes the agencies' ability to raise capital cheaply and to pass along savings to consumers through affordable mortgages.</p>
        <p>''We don't think it makes any sense to isolate one of the many tools Congress gave us,'' he said, ''because if you do, you are quietly or unintentionally unraveling the whole mechanism.''</p>
        <p>Still, the markets are sensitive to every twist and turn in the legislation's progress. In March, when Treasury Under Secretary Gary  Gensler lent support at a subcommittee hearing to some aspects of the legislation, including repeal of the liquidity facility, prices fell sharply.</p>
        <p>The bill remains a long way from becoming law. Representative Baker expects it to be approved by the subcommittee he heads before the end of the current term. But he does not see it moving much further until after the election decides which party will control the next Congress.</p>
        <p>The hearings on the bill, however, have put the agencies' status in play, and have aired concerns that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have grown too big and too concerned with profits, rather than fulfilling a public mandate to keep home mortgage money plentiful and affordable.</p>
        <p>''I think the real goal is just to have Fannie and Freddie come to the negotiating table,'' said Casey Colton, a bond fund manager at American Century Investments. ''There is some concern that the agencies believe that their mission is almost a manifest destiny to control a huge portion of the market.''</p>
