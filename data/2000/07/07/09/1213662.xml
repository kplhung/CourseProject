        <p>Orchestra and gigantic sax are coming to the music pier in Ocean City tonight at 8 for a concert with the Ocean City Pops. The group is an all-saxophone sextet that plays a variety of styles.</p>
        <p>According to the group's Web site, the monster sax will be making a homecoming of sorts. The horn is said to have been found abandoned in a building in Newark in the 1960's; workers rescued it just before tearing the building down. Don Stevens, the orchestra's founder, acquired the instrument from a man in Kentucky in 1989.</p>
