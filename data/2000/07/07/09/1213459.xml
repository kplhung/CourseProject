        <p>BORDERING the train tracks near Bronxville station, La Frontiera has set up its frontier in the space last occupied by Marichu. But unlike its predecessor, which dished up Basque and Spanish food, this newcomer offers Italian fare.</p>
        <p>The long bar is a popular stopping off place for commuters. But in a village with an embarrassment of restaurants, convenience is not the only reason for coming to this restaurant. This charmer can also cook.</p>
        <p>Judging from our sampling, pasta is the strength of Jose Avelar, the chef. The various farinaceous shapes came cooked to the right texture, and the combinations were classic and outstanding.</p>
        <p>Thick, heavier pastas, like spaghetti alla chitarra, perciatelli or bucatini, even old-fashioned spaghetti, are increasingly rare on menus. These pastas require attention: they need longer cooking time and, once done, tend to over cook quickly. But many are included on Mr. Avelar's menu, and not one arrived mushy.</p>
        <p>Tossed with crumbles of excellent fennel sausage, square-edged spaghetti alla chitarra delivered a luxury of flavors. And although pappardelle are usually paired with game meats -- and thus more appropriate for cool weather -- on one recent hot and humid evening we jumped at the chance to have these broad pasta ribbons sauced with chunky, savory boar stew and suffered not a moment of regret. The dish was exceptional.</p>
        <p>But other pasta offerings had their moments as well. Deliciously briny and fresh, tagliatelli frutti di mare came stocked with scallops, tiny clams and shrimps. Also enjoyable was fusilli bosciola, thick with mushrooms, sage and bits of pancetta. Even simple-sounding angel-hair pasta with tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil (al pomodoro) or with seafood came packed with favor. Along the same lines, properly creamy risotto, also with seafood, was equally pleasing.</p>
        <p>For a first course, a half portion of pasta served nicely, but a few appetizers were noteworthy as well. If available, grab a bowl of hefty, tender New Zealand mussels in white wine and garlic sauce. Meaty and rare beef Carpaccio, with chopped arugula and shavings of Parmesan, was both mouth filling and light. But with so many superior dishes to choose from, why bother with good but standard clams oreganato and poorly drained and slightly bitter broccoli rape?</p>
        <p>Entrees other than pasta brought mixed results. Almost as rich as lobster, six huge, gorgeous butterflied shrimp bore just a hint of smoke from their quick turn on a charcoal grill. A special of St. Peter's fish (John Dory) came with capers and perhaps a little too much butter. But a flood of marechiara sauce took some of the character away from a lovely piece of clean red snapper, and thick slices of pork loin proved a tad dry. Serious over cooking turned calf's liver into leather. A plate of vegetables -- carrot, squash, broccoli and tasty quartered roasted potato -- arrived to be shared family style.</p>
        <p>Patrons spending calories on pasta can save a few on desserts. For diners bent on having a sweet ending, rich, dense, chocolate roulade or a platter of cut fresh fruit should do the trick. Somewhat dry ricotta and mascarpone cheesecake, homey and sweet raspberry mousse cake and very wet tiramisu may be skipped.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner averages $36 without drinks, tax and tip. La Frontiera is near the movie theater.</p>
        <p>La Frontiera  104 Kraft Avenue, Bronxville.  961-2338.  VERY GOOD</p>
        <p>ATMOSPHERE -- Soft lighting, flowers and rough timbering give this small, neat storefront a romantic cast. Seating is intimate at the long banquette facing the handsome bar. More tables fill the roomier back dining area. Very good, friendly service.  SMOKING -- None permitted.
