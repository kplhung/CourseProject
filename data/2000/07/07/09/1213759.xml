        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I can relate to most of the things in ''Even for Sixth Graders, College Looms'' (front page, July 3), like the stress. But some I can't, like the fear of violence. I have never been afraid that a student is going to bring a gun to school because all of my schools have always seemed so safe.</p>
        <p>I think there is much more stress in sixth grade because the work is harder, my body is changing and we are not the oldest students in the school anymore. Also, since I have always been a good student, my expectations are high, and I feel bad when I do not meet them.</p>

        <p>I have never thought about college because I'm not even 13 yet, but maybe I should start thinking about it. If I had to choose a college today, I would choose one that had a good reputation academically and also had good sports teams. In a way I am scared of seventh grade, but I'm also kind of looking forward to it.</p>
