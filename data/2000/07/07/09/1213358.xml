        <p>To the Editor: Having just returned from Istria and a two-week stay in Motovun, we were delighted to find Daniel Lewis's ''Adriatic Pleasures in Abundance'' (May 21). After discovering Istria nearly 30 years ago, we have returned often to hike, listen to nightingales and cuckoos, sample truffles and fine wines.</p>
        <p>We would add the town of Porec (known as Colonia Julia Parentinum in Roman times) to the list of places to explore along the western shore. The ecclesiastical buildings known as the Euphrasius Basilica are among the best preserved examples of early Byzantine architecture in the world. In warm weather, concerts of early music bring the basilica courtyard to life.</p>

        <p>Just around the corner, where the stone-paved Decumanus (the main east-to-west street) meets the Cardo (the north-to-south artery), is our favorite restaurant, Cardo, with a large terrace overlooking fragments of Roman ruins and Venetian Gothic windows.</p>
