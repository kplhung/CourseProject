        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest Peter Smith's letter on the Ruskins and the play ''The Countess'' [''A Tragedy, at Heart,'' June 25]. As the actor happily engaged in playing one of John Ruskin's parents, I have to reply to his charge, ''What the play does not (cannot?) do, though, is show us that . . . John himself was a much more thoroughly abused victim -- of his one-of-a-kind upbringing by two loving, tough, generous, selfish, indulgent, demanding, all-too-imperfect parents.'' It is to the playwright Gregory Murphy's credit that all of the play's characters are dimensional, which is what makes them so much fun to play. I don't know where Mr. Smith was during the play's final scene, but without revealing the final moments, this scene makes it abundantly clear that John Ruskin is, ultimately, indeed victimized by -- well, you must see or read the play to find out.</p>
