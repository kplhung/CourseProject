        <p>IT has taken only a coat of paint to transform one of the city's most unusual landmarks, the 155th Street Viaduct, which connects St. Nicholas Place with the Macombs Dam Bridge. Although the elevated roadway has been much damaged by later changes, the soft buff color on the lacy 1893 structure has recaptured much of the sophisticated elegance of what had been a gritty metal hulk.</p>
        <p>In 1815 Robert Macomb, a miller, built a dam and bridge across the Harlem River near what is now 155th Street, charging a toll for travel from Manhattan to the Bronx.  Other, more sophisticated bridges followed, and in the mid-1880's a series of public improvements transformed the entire area.</p>
        <p>The Harlem River itself was widened and cut through to the Hudson, as the Harlem Ship Canal was built from 1888 to 1895, becoming a boon to waterborne traffic. The new waterway required more modern bridges, and the present Macombs Dam Bridge was completed in 1895, its 415-foot-long swing span designed by the engineer Alfred P. Boller with intricate iron fencing, gas lights and four distinctive control houses.</p>
        <p>Boller also designed a 1,600-foot-long viaduct rising from the Manhattan end of the new bridge to meet the intersection of 155th Street and St. Nicholas Place in Manhattan, 110 feet above the level of the river. Neighborhood boosters had long complained that the high plateau was inaccessible from surrounding areas. In 1890 Scientific American had lamented that horse-drawn vehicles had to make substantial detours: ''To draw a load up the hill a team has to be taken a mile or more to the south.''</p>
        <p>And although the elevated train running up Eighth Avenue stopped at 155th Street, before the building of the viaduct commuters returning home by the El had to descend to the street and then climb the equivalent of eight stories to their homes.</p>
        <p>The new roadway was lionized by The New York Times as ''A Street Built in Mid-Air -- New York's Wonderful Viaduct.'' The 155th Street Viaduct ran above the elevated line, connected to it by lacy stairways designed by Hecla Iron Works in Brooklyn; that firm later designed the above-ground iron and glass kiosks for the first subway line.</p>
        <p>At either end, rock-faced abutments of granite and limestone were fitted with decorative stairways and special faceted lanterns. According to research by Jay Shockley at the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the western terminus was marked by a pink granite fountain, the gift of the late businessman and philanthropist John Hooper.</p>
        <p>The fountain had a 28-foot-high column topped with a weather vane and a lantern; on one side was a wide watering trough for horses, on the other separate drinking places for dogs and humans.</p>
        <p>Although almost an industrial structure, the viaduct was as carefully and comprehensively designed as a park boulevard.  Special viewing platforms extended out at the center, although it appears that pedestrians could not glimpse much more than left field in the Polo Grounds just to the north, where the New York Giants played from 1891 to 1957.</p>
        <p>AFTER the $700,000 viaduct opened in October 1893, the journal Engineering News praised it as a ''thoughtful creation combining fitness, stability and beauty.'' Lawson Fuller, a neighborhood hotel owner and real estate investor who lived at 155th and Amsterdam, probably drove down the viaduct when the new 415-foot-long bridge opened in 1895. Fuller, a carriage enthusiast, wanted to be the first to cross -- but a bicyclist sneaked in ahead of him.</p>
        <p>The bridge and two related works put the viaduct at the center of a suite of road works unsurpassed in turn-of-the-century New York. These included the 1898 Harlem Speedway (running from the west end of the viaduct up what is now the Harlem River Drive) and the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, designed in 1891 and built in stages.</p>
        <p>Although the Harlem River Drive was later threaded under the 155th Street Viaduct, the elevated structure survived without major changes until the 1960's, when most of the railings and lampposts were replaced with modern equivalents, or simply removed.</p>
        <p>Now there are only a few fragments of the railings, and the surface of the viaduct looks like any other urban highway, although the pronounced drop and the city views are dramatic. Anyone with vertigo should definitely not look over'' the edge of the viaduct to gaze at 155th Street far below, according to the Web site ''Forgotten New York'' (www.forgotten-ny.com), run by Kevin Walsh, a New York enthusiast.</p>
        <p>And it is underneath where this work is still its most majestic. At the intersection of 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, the view west is dramatic: an airy network of rivet-spotted columns and skinny crossbars marching away into the huge, rocky stone abutment leading up to St. Nicholas Place.</p>
        <p>But over time this Erector set-like framework became cloaked in dirt, and last year the New York City Department of Transportation began a comprehensive renovation of  both the 155th Street Viaduct and the Macombs Dam Bridge.</p>
        <p>ONE of the first things done was to paint the supports the original color, a light yellowy buff, a startling change even for motorists whizzing past on the Harlem River Drive. Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the department, said that the $160 million project would be finished in 2003 and would include the restoration of the pedestrian elements like the stairs. The structure was designated a landmark in 1992.</p>
        <p>The Hecla-designed stairway railings are lying in a rusty heap on the Bronx side of the bridge. Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, said that the stairways at the center of the structure were too deteriorated to save and that they would have to be completely rebuilt. She also said that the Hooper Fountain, which has been disassembled, would be restored and placed in a slightly different location.</p>
        <p>The 155th Street Viaduct is far from the standard high-style landmark -- making its optimistic mixture of engineering and beauty all the more inspiring.</p>
