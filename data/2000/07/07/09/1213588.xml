        <p>WHEN a political party that has been in control for many decades is beaten at the polls, it's a good sign that voters are clamoring for sweeping change -- and an indication of how much things already have changed.</p>
        <p>That is the case in Mexico, where last week Vicente Fox Quesada became president-elect, ending 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. Though Mexico is in far better shape than it was a decade ago, let alone two decades ago, it is still a developing country.</p>
        <p>Investors charged in after the vote, pushing the Bolsa index up more than 6 percent for the week.</p>
        <p>Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, president of the Latin America Enterprise fund, a Miami-based private equity fund with about $450 million under management, took time last week to talk about the effect of the election on Mexico's market outlook. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. Isn't the economy that Mr. Fox will inherit from the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo, in pretty good shape?</p>
        <p>A. Zedillo is leaving him in a good position in terms of foreign trade. Exports are running between $160 billion and $170 billion annually, due mostly to increased trade due to the North American Free Trade Agreement and not to the recent rise in oil prices. As recently as 1995, following the peso crisis, Mexican exports were about $80 billion a year. External debt has evaporated as a macroeconomic issue; it is about $160 billion today, roughly what it was in 1995. And the budget deficit is totally under control. However, unemployment is a problem.</p>
        <p>Q. Is the new president likely to take steps to push down the unemployment rate?</p>
        <p>A. Due to a lack of flexibility in the budget, he doesn't have much room to maneuver. After paying for a number of fixed costs, like debt service and education expenditures, only 7 percent to 10 percent of the budget is left over for discretionary spending.</p>
        <p>Q. What sorts of problems does Mr. Fox want, or need, to tackle?</p>
        <p>A. So far he has talked about focusing on corruption and on drugs, which are important. He faces big problems in dealing with safety issues, especially in Mexico City. And the banking system is still decimated. In Mexico, credit is scarce for midsize companies and not there at all for little companies. He also faces challenges from the unions, which are controlled by the PRI.</p>
        <p>Q. What are the prospects for privatization?</p>
        <p>A. The biggest opportunity is in privatizing the electric utility industry, which is a $70 billion to $80 billion business, half in power generation and half in distribution. The major impediment to change there is the union. It is totally opposed to privatization.</p>
        <p>Q. Because of his years at Coca-Cola and his positive attitude about foreign investment, doesn't Mr. Fox run the risk of criticism from Mexican nationalists?</p>
        <p>A. What Fox has to do, and what he talked about in his campaign, is show he has a high priority for social welfare programs. That means better schools, security for people, rural investment and roads. If he does that, the private investment from the U.S. and elsewhere will be more digestible to the people. There has to be a social dimension to his program. But he won't have the money to pay for it unless he privatizes the electric utility industry.</p>
        <p>Q. Your fund invests in privately held companies. How is the money divided?</p>
        <p>A. About 10 percent is in manufacturing; between 40 percent and 50 percent is in various types of services, from funeral homes to telephones; and the balance is in an assortment of things, from financial companies to Internet companies. Roughly 25 percent of the money in the fund is invested in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Q. Individual investors who have bet on Mexico and Latin America have not been well rewarded for some time. Is there reason to expect higher returns?</p>
        <p>A. Currently, valuations in Latin America are reasonably low relative to prospective earnings growth, and that applies with some force in Mexico. With its finances in pretty good shape, if Mexico grows 5.5 percent in 2000, its market should do pretty well over the balance of the year. For example, Cemex and Telefonos de Mexico will respond to faster growth in Mexico.</p>
