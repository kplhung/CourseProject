        <p>Claire McCardell and B. H. Wragge, who popularized the shirtdress in the 1930's, had it exactly right: women want comfortable summer fashion. Even the couture-clad Duchess of Windsor turned to Wragge, the New York men's shirtmaker who opened a women's business based on shirtwaists, for easy hot-weather styles. Today's woman has rediscovered the practical shirtdress in silk and cotton, and even beaded sparklers for evening, bottom right. In the 60's, the shirtdress was cut as a loose chemise, followed by the wrap style of the 70's. And for the summer of 2000, this American classic is back.</p>
