        <p>WHEN Odetta, the unofficial queen of American folk music, last released a blues album 38 years ago folk purists wagged their admonishing fingers at her for betraying them.</p>
        <p>''Blues Everywhere I Go,'' her latest blues album, proves once again that Odetta's talent transcends any one style.</p>
        <p>''Back then there were people who wanted to make sure that the music stayed where it was,'' said the 70-year-old singer, who performs an outdoors blues concert from 4 to 6 p.m. on Saturday at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield. ''But I'm not a purist in any way, shape or form.''</p>
        <p>Odetta may be a folk icon, but her music includes the blues, jazz, spirituals, Appalachian songs and English folk songs. ''Blues Everywhere I Go,'' her 27th solo album, pays homage to the great blueswomen of the 20's and 30's: Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Victoria Spivey, Sippie Wallace and Memphis Minnie. ''T.B. Blues,'' ''Unemployment Blues,''  ''Rich Man's Blues,'' ''WPA Blues,'' and ''Please Send Me Someone To Love,'' a duet with Dr. John, are among the recording's dozen songs.</p>
        <p>''One of the many reasons I wanted to do the blues album is that I get pretty fed up with stereotyping of our black community as being represented by prurient sex or 'I'm gonna shoot you or I'm gonna cut you','' she said in a phone conversation from her home in New York. ''There was blues in the 20's and 30's that dealt with society's foot stepping on our throats.''</p>
        <p>That oppression, Odetta continued, included sending black soldiers to Europe during World War I and II and their returning to segregation and unemployment.</p>
        <p>This kind of social protest has long been evident in Odetta's vast song repertory. The seeds of social conscience were planted during her childhood in Los Angeles. ''They didn't have signs for black and whites, but you knew where you could and couldn't go,'' she said. ''There were no signs, but there was attitude.''</p>
        <p>Odetta left home at 18 to perform in the chorus of a national tour of ''Finian's Rainbow,'' a musical, appropriately enough, about prejudice. She then settled in San Francisco where she learned to play the guitar and began performing in the folk clubs. She worked across town from a young, aspiring performer named Maya Angelou. ''I was playing the Tin Angel and Maya was at the Purple Onion,'' said Odetta, who has remained friends with the poet. ''She's done pretty good since then.''</p>
        <p>So has Odetta. Her reputation is that of a singer of uncompromising integrity as a result of performances at the Newport Festival, at Carnegie Hall and for President John F. Kennedy on the nationally televised program, ''Dinner With the President.'' She marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma and she sang at the 1963 March on Washington. Odetta was also an influence on Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin and younger singer-songwriters including Tracy Chapman.</p>
        <p>Odetta still acts when afforded the opportunity (''I'm a big ham,'' she said with a laugh).</p>
        <p>Her film credits include Tony Richardson's ''Sanctuary'' (1960) with Yves Montand and Lee Remick. And on television she appeared with Cicely Tyson in ''The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.'' She has also appeared with the Stratford Shakespeare Company in Ontario and at the Neptune Theater in Halifax.</p>
        <p>Odetta's folk identity, however, remains. Since the social injustices that primed her singing career 50 years ago show no signs of relenting, she still has plenty to sing about.</p>
        <p>''The song is the result of something,'' she said. ''I'm infuriated. Does it take 41 bullets to kill someone? I'm infuriated that a cop has a license to kill an innocent person and that a jury lets him get away with it.''</p>
        <p>The worst thing that could happen to Odetta's career, it would seem, would be to have a perfect world. ''Then I'd have nothing to sing about,'' she laughed.</p>
        <p>That wouldn't be so perfect.</p>
        <p>Odetta performs out of doors on Saturday from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, 258 Main Street, Ridgefield. Tickets are $15 and $20. The number to call for ticket information is (203)  438-4519.</p>
