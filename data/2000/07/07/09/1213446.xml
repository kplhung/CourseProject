        <p>POTENTIAL buyers usually aren't shy about flushing the toilets, running the faucets, counting the closets and opening and closing the windows and doors. And after that, in most cases, they go out and hire a professional house inspector to pick up where they left off.</p>
        <p>What happens, though, when a buyer is buying a potential house -- one that hasn't even been built yet -- or recently completed new construction?</p>
        <p>'' 'New construction' doesn't mean 'without flaws,' '' said Kenneth T. Austin, president of HouseMaster, a nationwide home-inspection company based in Bound Brook, N.J. ''Many times there are flaws in the construction of new homes, some of which can be serious and expensive.''</p>
        <p>Among the problems Mr. Austin's inspectors have found in new homes are: damaged or improperly installed fixtures; water penetration caused by improper grading of the soil where it meets the foundation; foundation cracking caused by improper backfilling of soil around the house; improper deck supports; improperly wired electrical receptacles; disconnected heating and air-conditioning ducts; unlabeled electrical panels; and even nonfunctioning light switches and electrical outlets.</p>
        <p>''Most new-home buyers don't see the need for a home inspection,'' Mr. Austin said, adding that while construction codes are designed to ensure that new construction is completed in accordance with a set of minimum standards, the code-enforcement inspectors can't catch everything and aren't even looking for problems of an aesthetic nature.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Austin said, if the grading of the soil against the foundation slopes away from the house -- as it should, to prevent water from pooling along the foundation wall -- the building inspector will typically be satisfied. However, he said, if the soil has not been tamped down properly, there is a possibility that after a period of time the soil will settle, thereby creating a slope toward the house and the possibility of future seepage.</p>
        <p>Another thing that would probably not be noted by a building inspector would be sloppily mitered joints on woodwork around doors and windows, an aesthetic eyesore rather than a structural problem.</p>
        <p>''Buying a new house gives people a false sense of security,'' Mr. Austin said. ''They end up looking at the whole process through rose-colored glasses.''</p>
        <p>Paul Gallo, a Manhattan registered architect, agreed.</p>
        <p>''When you're thinking about buying a newly constructed house you shouldn't be bashful,'' Mr. Gallo said. ''You have to get inside and slam some doors, make some noise and jump up and down on the floors.  You have to get physical.''</p>
        <p>He said that one of the biggest problems that new houses have -- despite the fact that they may meet the minimum requirements of the building codes -- is that the floors and walls are not necessarily as solid and soundproof as those in older construction.</p>
        <p>''The first thing to do when you walk into a new house is test its bounce factor,'' Mr. Gallo said, explaining that he encourages clients to jump up and down in the middle of the room to get a feel for how much the floor gives under such punishment. ''If you have kids with you, send them upstairs and have someone go up and play with them,'' he said.  ''That will give you some idea of the soundproofing and some idea of what it's going to be like living in the house.''</p>
        <p>Another thing that prospective purchasers of new construction can do is to turn on the heating and air-conditioning system to determine whether it has any annoying quirks.  ''If the ductwork thumps every time the air-conditioning comes on, that's going to drive you crazy after a few weeks,'' he said, adding that it is also wise to run the dishwasher and washing machine to determine whether the water pipes bang when the machines cycle on and off.</p>
        <p>''These things may not be deal-breakers, but you're really doing yourself a favor by having a checklist of things that should be corrected before you agree to buy the house,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Robert Tierman, a real estate lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., said that people buying a new house can exercise the greatest degree of control if they buy early enough in the process to dictate the material and construction methods that will be used.</p>
        <p>''Builders like to maximize their flexibility,'' Mr. Tierman said, explaining that if a builder's contract specifies only ''a fully-equipped bathroom,'' that allows the builder to decide what type and grade fixtures to install. ''If you'll be satisfied with the fixtures the builder installs you'll have no problem,'' he said. ''But if you want Kohler plumbing fixtures, you better make sure you specify Kohler fixtures in the contract.''</p>
        <p>In fact, buyers who are negotiating a construction contract might want to include a provision that will allow home-inspection firms like HouseMaster to make periodic inspections during construction.</p>
        <p>''We recommend a three-stage inspection,'' said Mr. Austin, the company's president. The first inspection, he said, would be conducted after the foundation and rough framing is complete. The second would be after all heating, cooling, electrical equipment and plumbing have been installed. And the third would be after construction has been completed.</p>
        <p>''We're there to look for errors in workmanship,'' he said, adding that a staged inspection -- which costs about $250 for each of the three inspections -- is not intended to second-guess the architect, the builder or the building inspector, but to ensure that the buyer is getting the quality of workmanship being paid  for.</p>
        <p>But won't a builder bristle at having someone else inspect his handiwork?</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Mr. Austin said.  ''But you have to hang tough. People have to realize that the greatest power they have is the power to walk away from the deal.''</p>
        <p>John G. Hall, a Staten Island real estate lawyer and former chairman of the New York State Bar Association's Real Property Section, said that in many new-home sales the buyer bases the decision on a model home constructed by the builder.</p>
        <p>''If the house you are buying is based on a model, as opposed to a set of plans and specifications, you want to make sure that you will be getting what you think you'll be getting,'' Mr. Hall said. For example, he said, a builder who installs high-quality fixtures in the model could install less-expensive fixtures in the houses built for sale -- if the contract permits.</p>
        <p>Even room sizes in models can be deceiving. ''I can tell you that I have seen some builders use scaled-down furniture in their models so that the rooms would look larger,'' Mr. Hall said, explaining that while such practices are not engaged in by reputable builders, buyers should leave nothing to chance.</p>
        <p>''Builders' contracts are usually very onerous,'' Mr. Hall said. ''If I were buying a new house today, and I wasn't a lawyer myself, the first thing I'd do would be to hire one.''</p>
