        <p>THE last time I had set foot in the Beirut airport, exactly 15 years before, a hijacked Trans World Airlines jet sat on the runway. A United States Navy diver had been murdered and thrown from the plane, and 39 Americans would be held hostage for 17 days before being freed in Damascus.</p>
        <p>In the filthy shambles of the terminal, pistol-waving hijackers wearing hoods made from airline pillowcases held a news conference that turned into a near riot when television cameramen climbed on the table that the hijackers had carefully laid out with Lebanese dishes. The windows in the control tower were still shattered from the time a few years earlier when they were shot out by the man known as ''Hamzi the Hijacker,'' who was working on his ninth plane.</p>
        <p>The airport was convenient for hijackers in those days. When they were done, all they had to do was to cross the tarmac to go home, melting into into the surrounding Shiite Muslim shantytowns.</p>
        <p>Now, when I returned in the early summer of 2000, the terminal was new and clean, partly lined with gleaming tile. An efficient line processed visas, where once a grimy customs inspector whispered to me, ''Be careful, my friend, you are in the Orient now.'' Outside, instead of the chaos I used to know, was an orderly taxi line with a no-haggling fixed price. A smooth new highway, swooping through tunnels and overpasses, had replaced the old rutted road studded with militia checkpoints.</p>
        <p>We drove past gleaming new high-rises and glittery restaurants to the Phoenecia, a huge and gaudy palace right on the Green Line, the no-man's land that once divided the city. The hotel district was one of the first and fiercest battlegrounds of the 25-year civil war that made a Lebanon a synonym for brutal anarchy in the 1970's and 80's, and next door the battered, shell-holed hulk of the Holiday Inn still loomed.</p>
        <p>Just to travel across the city back then was to risk your life. Snipers were dug into the broken buildings on each side: as the war wound on they became skilled, hitting people in the head more often.</p>
        <p>Christian right and Muslim left were the working cliches for the journalists, but the reality was much more complex. Christians killed each other to eliminate rivals, and alliances shifted bloodily on the Muslim side. Even a traffic accident could set off a gun battle that quickly spread through a wide area and lasted for hours. All the militias had their own jails. Piles of rotting garbage, occasionally set afire, lined the streets.</p>
        <p>Ordinary Lebanese hunkered down through artillery barrages, power outages and water shortages, siege and invasion, somehow maintaining the extravagant style that is their endearing hallmark. There are no real statistics here, but it is generally estimated that 150,000 people died and 17,000 are still missing.</p>
        <p>The morning after I arrived I walked around the streets I used to know. There were no gunmen and no garbage. A McDonald's stood at the corner where the Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson was kidnapped in 1985; it had valet parking for the Range Rovers. It was eerie at first to walk on the streets where 15 years before you could not go, in the city center that had been the heart of the Green Line, where I once met a gunmen who been in position so long he had planted a garden.</p>
        <p>The old buildings, Ottoman and French Colonial, have now been meticulously restored into one of the most gorgeous downtowns anywhere.</p>
        <p>What happened, I wondered. Could these people have all suddenly come to their senses?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately not.</p>
        <p>''What you see, it's all a facade, a fake veneer,'' grumbled a veteran Lebanese journalist, launching into an hourlong tirade against government corruption and inefficiency, an economic crisis spinning out of control and Syrian domination -- after, of course, making sure that his name would not be used.</p>
        <p>The new highway and the luxury hotels skirt and conceal the slums and squatters in much of the city. Even in the flashy stores on Rue Verdon -- Gucci, Versace, Valentino -- business is down. The rebuilding was almost entirely the single-minded effort of Rafik Hariri, prime minister from 1992 to 1998; his enemies are now in power and cutting off his permits.</p>
        <p>Over and over, old friends and new acquaintances, using phrases like ''rotten'' and ''crooked,'' told me that, fundamentally, nothing has changed in Lebanon; that politics and economics remain, as one put it,  ''parasitical, feudal and entirely rapacious.''</p>
        <p>But of course some things have changed in the decade since the war ended. By 1990, the paroxysm of violence that had torn Lebanon since the mid-1970's had turned on itself, so badly that many Lebanese were desperate to restore an ordinary sense of business and life. So they welcomed the calm that Syrian control brought them.</p>
        <p>Today, most visibly, the presence of armed militias in which gunmen ruled has been ended, and that is no small thing.  (They are officially disarmed except for Hezbollah in the South, although much of the weaponry is just hidden away.) The remaining Palestinians are disenfranchised, confined to their camps. The ability of the Maronite Catholic elite to either dominate the country or to establish an autonomous entity has been ended. Perhaps most important for the future is the rise of the Shiite Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, to power and respectability. Politically, Syria calls all the shots now.</p>
        <p>But what has not changed is the strict division along religious lines that defines -- and essentially undermines -- Lebanon as a country.</p>
        <p>WHEN Lebanon was formed in 1943 out of a French mandate granted after World War I, power was apportioned by religion, mainly to protect the Maronites; they were to hold the Presidency, with other offices apportioned to Sunni Moslems, Shites, Druse and 13 smaller sects.</p>
        <p>And that has always been the paradox of Lebanon: What has enabled its people to survive and even prosper through unbelievably difficult times, like the civil war, are the tight bonds of family, village, clan and religion. But the same narrow loyalties prevent a national social contract.</p>
        <p>The headquarters for the small band of foreign journalists throughout those war years was the shabby, beloved Commodore Hotel, presided over by its suave, impeccably-dressed manager, Fouad Saleh, who could accomplish anything. The parrot at the bar imitated incoming shellfire, Fat Tommy the cat slept wedged in the warmth between the Associated Press and Reuters news wires, and the telexes, magically, always worked. Guests checking in were asked, ''Shelling side or sniper side?''</p>
        <p>One night during the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982, a desperately needed truckload of bottled water materialized, bribed through Israeli lines near the airport. ''You see, we are really all Levantine together,'' smiled the man from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine next to me at the bar.</p>
        <p>But in the final five years of the war, when  erstwhile allies turned on each other in a frenzy -- Shiites against Palestinians, Hezbollah against its Shiite rival Amal, Christians against Christians, the Lebanese army against Christians -- the Commodore was destroyed in street fighting between the Druze and a Sunni militia, the Murabitoun.  A Druse gunman carried off the parrot to an unknown fate.</p>
        <p>Now the Commodore has been rebuilt as a fancy Meridien, with a Benihana Japanese steakhouse. Just off the lobby is a place called the ''News Bar,'' with a carpet embroidered to imitate newspaper front pages.  When I looked in the other day, it was empty.</p>
        <p>Fouad Saleh died a few years back, I was told, and, because of his mixed marriage, neither the Muslim nor the Christian cemetery would accept his body. Fouad, the ultimate fixer, had been beaten at last by Lebanon.</p>
