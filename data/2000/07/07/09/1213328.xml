        <p>EVERY summer, as sure as the rain in Spain, American college students flood Europe's cities for study and a taste of the old world.</p>
        <p>But this year, a strong dollar means that even more students -- and a wider range of them -- are jetting abroad for the summer. With recent exchange rates in many countries better for Americans than they have been in more than a decade, students are realizing their dollars will go further, and colleges and groups that sponsor study abroad say they are seeing double-digit increases in the number of students traveling, especially to Europe.</p>
        <p>Mary Dwyer, president of IES, a 50-year-old organization that runs programs for private and public colleges, said college students realize that ''part of the experience is traveling around once you're there, going to dinner and museums, and they realize that they can afford more of that with the currency exchanges now than they could a few years ago.''</p>
        <p>Many students now track prices abroad on the Web, she said. ''These are very intelligent, discerning consumers.''</p>
        <p>The euro has declined since it was introduced in January 1999, to a low of 88.5 cents to the dollar in May. (It was 95 cents in early July.) As a result, colleges and groups can offer lower prices on trips abroad, and out-of-pocket costs have gone down.</p>
        <p>Enrollment in IES's summer programs is up 32 percent to 277 students this year. The Institute of International Education, which tracks overall patterns in study abroad, says enrollment was up 10 percent for the period from the fall of 1998 through the summer of 1999. Todd Davis, who tracks the numbers for the Institute, estimates that about 40,000 college students will be abroad this summer, 25,000 of them in Europe.</p>
        <p>The increase in summer enrollment is particularly striking among public university students, who tend to be more price-conscious. For example, during the regular school year, 15 percent of the students who go abroad with IES are enrolled in public universities; in summer, that number jumps to 85 percent.</p>
        <p>That may change, though. ''Our students have always gone during the summer because it's all they could afford,'' said Diane Pecknold, who runs study-abroad programs for the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''Now, they can afford to go for the semester.''</p>
        <p>A favorable exchange rate is not the only reason behind the increase. A strong economy in this country helps, too, as does a new notion of a well-rounded education.</p>
        <p>''Included in that definition is a sojourn abroad, especially since the end of the Cold War,'' said Mr. Davis.</p>
        <p>For the year overall, he said, 64 percent of students traveling will go to Europe, 6  percent to Asia. The biggest increases in recent years are in Latin America, which now draws 16 percent of those studying abroad.</p>
        <p>As for whether a strong dollar is keeping foreign students from traveling to this country, Mr. Davis said apparently not. While those numbers dropped during the Asian currency crisis that began in 1997, they have now begun to rebound.</p>
