        <p>J.J. Licari and Joe Licari, Bellmore, N.Y., March 18, 2000</p>
        <p>J.J. Licari: My dad and I are identical. The way we speak, the way we gesture -- it's a little freaky sometimes. I think every generation gets a little better. You have good values, take them for what they are worth, change them when you should. At first my parents were like, ''Of course you have to go to college.'' But I want to be an actor. My dad wanted me to have more of a secure life than he did. He's such a hard worker, seeing me being lackadaisical about everything was hard. But the college thing wore off. You know what they say now? Just take acting classes; what are you waiting for? The only thing I can say is I wanted to relax in my youth a little more. This was my first real feel of getting my photograph taken. I was thinking the same thing I'm always thinking: that I want to be a star. Except it was more intense. It felt a little for real for the first time. I was thinking, Hey, hey, finally I'm starting.</p>

        <p>Joe Licari: I hoped J.J. wouldn't do what I did -- not go to school. But he wants to act. In the beginning, it was hard. Still, if you're not happy, what's the point? Little by little, I let it go. I don't think he's ever going to work a 9-to-5 job. Maybe it's because he's seen me work 9 to 5 all my life to support the family. Or is it just because kids are spoiled? At the mirror a weird thing happened. It was the first time I thought about him being 21. And I looked in the mirror and saw me. I was looking in the mirror and seeing me like when I was a kid. It was a reflection of me, young. I blazed off into my youth.</p>
