        <p>THE New Jersey Symphony Orchestra's first Amadeus Festival was spread among several locales, some less than satisfactory. Since the advent of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, however, the festival's all-Mozart concerts are performed in Prudential Hall and in Princeton's Richardson Auditorium, with a lecture in the Newark Museum.</p>
        <p>Improved surroundings, plus well-conceived programming and lively pre-performance talks, are bringing a substantial audience to the three-week event, which has begun to draw the beautiful people of concert and chamber music. This fourth festival, for instance, features a roster of the pianists Misha and Cipa Dichter, Ruth Laredo and Vladimir Feltsman, and the violinist Pamela Frank.</p>

        <p>THE New Jersey Symphony Orchestra's first Amadeus Festival was spread among several locales, some less than satisfactory. Since the advent of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, however, the festival's all-Mozart concerts are performed in Prudential Hall and in Princeton's Richardson Auditorium, with a lecture in the Newark Museum.</p>
        <p>Improved surroundings, plus well-conceived programming and lively pre-performance talks, are bringing a substantial audience to the three-week event, which has begun to draw the beautiful people of concert and chamber music. This fourth festival, for instance, features a roster of the pianists Misha and Cipa Dichter, Ruth Laredo and Vladimir Feltsman, and the violinist Pamela Frank.</p>
        <p>Zdenek Macal, the orchestra's music director, continues his project of conducting Mozart's 41 symphonies in approximately reverse order: by this year he has progressed backward from the final ''Jupiter'' to Nos. 13, 14 and 15. But Mr. Macal is not so attached to this format that he can't see the value of performing mature works, so the festival concludes with a favorite: No. 38, the ''Prague.''</p>
        <p>Amadeus opens, typically, with a high-energy lecture-demonstration. This year Peter Schickele, in character as the well-known professor who uncovers the hilariously zany works of P. D. Q. Bach, should get things off to a very silly start with a Mozart-related program called ''A Little Nightmare Music.'' (No, the title is not a riff on the Stephen Sondheim show -- it's from Mozart's ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.'')</p>
        <p>In Mr. Schickele's annual P. D. Q. Bach Carnegie Hall concerts, he often conducts a bizarre little band called the New York Pickup Orchestra, whose members include the likes of a bargain-counter tenor and a bass drum slapped with a dead fish. On Tuesday, he leads the New Jersey Symphony, explaining -- or apologizing -- as he goes along.</p>
        <p>His Flute Concerto, to be performed with the orchestra's Kathleen Nester as soloist, was commissioned in 1991 for the bicentenary of Mozart's death. Like a number of Mr. Schickele's more serious compositions, it is earmarked by musical playfulness.</p>
        <p>''The slow movement is exactly the slow movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 1, from when he was 8 years old,'' Mr. Schickele said. ''It's played with Mozart's original instrumentation, but the woodwinds weave an elegaic line around the music.</p>
        <p>''It's something like painting over old photographs,'' he added, before quickly making clear that his own composed line was not an attempt to improve on Mozart.</p>
        <p>''Overture to the Civilian Barber'' was part of an opera Mr. Schickele composed at 18 (before P. D. Q. materialized), when a friend in his hometown of Fargo, N.D., was running for mayor. (He lost.) It is on Tuesday's program because Mr. Schickele decided, looking back, that the piece sounds more like Mozart than Rossini.</p>
        <p>''Nightmare Music'' is P. D. Q. Bach's one-act account of how Mozart died. In this concert version, Mr. Schickele, who sings the role of Salieri, will tell the story in advance: the slapstick plot has to do with clumsy P. D. Q. jostling Salieri's elbow, causing poison to drop into the wrong person's drink.</p>
        <p>Following those antics, the weekend program gets down to business with the real ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,'' before focusing on double and triple piano concertos. Misha and Cipa Dichter, who often perform together as well as separately, have great respect for the four-hand repertory. Mrs. Dichter once described it as ''the ugly duckling of chamber music'' and said, ''Misha and I spend hundreds of hours putting it together.''</p>
        <p>Mozart composed a triple concerto for three of his pupils, which the Dichters are to perform with Peggy DeArmond-Rogers, the orchestra's usual pianist, after the Dichters play the much better Concerto in E flat for Two Pianos. This concert ends with the light, short Symphony No. 14.</p>
        <p>This year's prelude talks seem particularly well thought out. The first is an overview of the concerts by the pianist Jeffrey Swann, and the second, by Dr. Lillian Robbins, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University's Newark campus, is about the prodigal mind. The festival's final weekend is preceded by some sort of ''Mozart-era Jeopardy'' discussion, where members of the audience will be invited to challenge or match wits with a panel of, if not experts, at least gamesmen.</p>
        <p>The lecture at the Newark Museum is by Gordon Shaw, author of ''Keeping Mozart in Mind'' (Academic Press, 1999), about the enhancing effect of musical study on the brain. His other publications are in neuroscience and elementary particle physics. Two finalists in one of the orchestra's Young Artist Auditions will also perform Mozart's elegant two-piano sonata, his only finished work in that form.</p>
        <p>The chamber music program next week features Ms. Laredo with orchestra members, who include the recently appointed concertmaster, Eric Wyrick. Ms. Frank is the violin soloist in the next orchestral program, with the appealing ''Turkish'' concerto, and in the final concert Mr. Feltsman performs the meaty C minor Piano Concerto K.491.</p>
