        <p>The 92-mile-an-hour fastball hit the NY on the front of Mike Piazza's batting helmet, making an ugly sound and causing Piazza to tumble to the dirt like a mannequin. Piazza could not avoid Roger Clemens's pitch, and he lay motionless at Yankee Stadium with his eyes staring into the black sky. It was a vacant look.</p>
        <p>Piazza's eyes remained blank for several seconds as trainers and his manager, Bobby Valentine, scampered out of the third-base dugout to check on the most valuable Met. Clemens had his hands on his knees while boos floated around the stadium.</p>
        <p>After about two minutes, Piazza was helped to his feet. He looked groggy as he walked gingerly to the dugout and then to the clubhouse to get examined. The Mets were not groggy. They were just angry, angry at Clemens for throwing inside at Lenny Harris and Derek Bell in the first inning and then for hitting Piazza in a dangerous spot in the second.</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, the Mets were worried about Piazza after he sustained a concussion, his second in less than six weeks. Piazza never lost consciousness and he was taken to a hospital for precautionary X-rays. But one Met official said it was doubtful that Piazza would play in tonight's series finale at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>''He busted him right in his face, man,'' Harris said. ''For a guy with the experience he has, a pitcher with great control, that's not good for the game. If you want to hit someone, you hit him from the head down, not in the face. The guy's got a bright career ahead of him and a ball hits him in his face, it could end his career.''</p>
        <p>Todd Pratt initially spoke slowly, but the more he talked about seeing the Mets' best player flat on his back, the more perturbed he became.</p>
        <p>''There's no words for it,'' Pratt said. ''It's one of the worst things I've ever seen in baseball. If he meant it or not, it didn't look good. I lost a lot of respect for Roger Clemens.''</p>
        <p>If Piazza's headaches do not subside, it is possible that he could miss Tuesday's All-Star Game in Atlanta. Seattle's Alex Rodriguez was scheduled to start at shortstop for the American League, but he also sustained a concussion on Friday and is not expected to play in the game now.</p>
        <p>Still, General Manager Steve Phillips tried to preach optimism about the dazed Piazza.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure tomorrow's out for him,'' Phillips said. ''We'll evaluate it as we go. This is less of an issue than when he got in the backswing in L.A. That's a good sign.''</p>
        <p>As several Mets stood along the railing in the dugout, they surely felt that Clemens's pitch was intentional. Piazza clubbed a grand slam off Clemens when the Mets routed the Yankees, 12-2, on June 9, and he is  7 for 12 with three homers against Clemens in his career.</p>
        <p>But Piazza did not get the chance to improve those statistics because he was on his back after two pitches. Valentine, Pratt and Todd Zeile mentioned Piazza's tremendous success against Clemens as a reason his frightening fastball was suspicious to them.</p>
        <p>''We thought that what he did was wrong,'' Zeile said. ''Not necessarily that he wanted to hit Mike in the head, but he wanted to hit him.''</p>
        <p>Every time something happens to Piazza, from being hit by foul tips, backswings or fastballs, the Mets inhale and hope he is fine. Piazza is batting .354 with 24 homers and 72 runs batted in, but it has been a treacherous season. That is something Piazza understands as a catcher and a high-profile player.</p>
        <p>''You're always going to have in the back of your mind that it's possible'' to have a serious injury, Piazza said last month. ''It's like driving a car. You know you're a good driver, but in the back of your mind, you know there's always some wacko who could come up and nail you. That doesn't mean you're not going to drive.''</p>
        <p>Piazza's first concussion came on May 31 when he was hit by the backswing of the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield, but he returned three days later. He missed five games with an injured right elbow and right wrist two months ago and did not start a game last week because he was struck on the left elbow by the backswing of the Marlins' Preston Wilson.</p>
        <p>If Piazza cannot play tonight, the Mets will use Pratt, who is 0 for his last 27, at catcher. After Piazza fell to the dirt and stared absently into the sky, some Mets switched their eyes from their injured teammate to the mound.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to me like if Clemens was concerned, he should have walked up to Mike and asked him if he was all right,'' Harris said. ''He just stood there. That was bad.''</p>
