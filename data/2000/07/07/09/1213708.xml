        <p>An off-duty police detective fired a single shot from his fifth-floor apartment window at a gunman who was confronting another man in the street and who had ignored the detective's order to drop the gun, officials said.</p>
        <p>The detective, Robert Lopez, was suspended for discharging his firearm in a reckless manner, the police said.</p>
        <p>Because the incident occurred at the officer's apartment building, the police would not provide the address.</p>
        <p>Detective Lopez said he saw a group of men in front of his building late Friday night, one of them with a gun, the police said. The detective yelled from the window, ordering the man to drop the weapon, the police said.</p>
        <p>When the man refused to drop the gun, Detective Lopez fired a single shot, dispersing the group, the police said.</p>
        <p>One of the men, Andre Tull, 25, of 2304 Sedgwick Avenue, was arrested a few blocks away and charged with possession of a weapon and menacing, although no gun was found, the police said.</p>
        <p>Detective Lopez is assigned to the 106th Precinct detective squad, which covers Ozone Park and Howard Beach, Queens.</p>
