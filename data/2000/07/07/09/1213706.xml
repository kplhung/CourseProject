        <p>In the first week of his first Tour de France, Fred Rodriguez was happy to be a team worker, leading out successful sprints for Mapei colleagues and hoping that his own turn for an exploit would come sooner or later. It came sooner.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Californian joined a 17-man breakaway early today in the eighth of 21 stages, stayed with the survivors as constant attacks whittled the group away and then crossed the line with a fine fourth-place finish in the 171-rider field. That elevated him into 11th place over all in the race.</p>
        <p>''I felt strong and tried to hold the group together for a sprint finish because I was one of the fastest guys there,'' Rodriguez said. ''It didn't happen, but I'm happy.''</p>
        <p>The reason it did not happen at the end of the 203.5-kilometer (126-mile) rolling ride from Limoges to Villeneuve-sur-Lot in southwestern France was Erik Dekker, a Dutchman with Rabobank and his country's time trial champion in 1997. He showed that ability to ride alone strongly when he bolted away from 10 fellow travelers with 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) to go and held them off by 52 seconds.</p>
        <p>On a cool, sunny day and before big crowds, Dekker was timed in 4 hours 22 minutes 14 seconds, a speed of 46 kilometers an hour (28 m.p.h.). Xavier Jan, a Frenchman with Francaise des Jeux, was second, with Vicente Garcia-Acosta, a Spaniard with Banesto, third, 56 seconds behind the winner, and Rodriguez fourth, two more seconds behind.</p>
        <p>Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom, finished in the main pack 5:42 behind Dekker and retained the yellow jersey of the overall leader since Dekker started in the nether regions of the standing based on total time. Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole, remained in second place over all, 12 seconds behind, with Marc Wauters, a Belgian with Rabobank, third, 1:17 behind.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez is easy to pick out among the Tour riders since he wears the red, white and blue, star-spangled jersey of the American professional champion, an honor he won in Philadelphia last month. In addition, he has been sporting an Old Glory do-rag on his head lately.</p>
        <p>Despite fine results this season, Rodriguez said in a recent interview that he understood his subsidiary role in the Tour as the leadout man for Tom Steels, Mapei's star sprinter and the winner of two stages.</p>
        <p>''I came here to help Tom, and those goals I think I've achieved,'' he said. ''I'm one of his main leadout guys, Stefano Zanini and myself.'' After Rodriguez goes as hard as he can in the last half-mile, Zanini, an Italian who is riding in the slipstream behind him, takes over as a pilot fish for Steels to protect him from both the wind and rivals.</p>
        <p>''Personal goals, I'm still pretty open-minded,'' Rodriguez continued. ''Things happen, especially in the Tour de France. It's such intense racing. There are a lot more flat stages that might suit me,'' he added presciently. ''I'm just waiting to see what time gives me.''</p>
        <p>Last year, it gave him little -- and Rodriguez had himself to blame.</p>
        <p>His future with Mapei looked dubious after the 1999 season, when he recorded only three minor victories and displeased management with his lackadaisical behavior.</p>
        <p>''Last year I had growing pains,'' he said. ''My first year in Europe, away from my family, my girlfriend, living in a foreign country, a foreign culture. Figuring out where I belonged took a while. There were times when I went home and took a little too much time off.''</p>
        <p>He paused and admitted it flatly: ''I took advantage of that time off'' -- at his home in Emeryville, Calif.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the year I thought it over. After re-evaluating my whole year and knowing where my mistakes were and where my strengths were, I just came into 2000 saying, 'This is my year. I either figure out where I belong or I have to quit.'</p>
        <p>''That's the way I put it to myself: I either make a difference this year or I don't belong here.''</p>
        <p>With seven victories this year, he has made a difference. In addition to the United States champion's jersey, he won a daily stage in the Four Days of Dunkirk race in France this spring and then another stage and the points jersey in the Tour of Switzerland last month.</p>
        <p>Although he now ranks highest among Mapei's riders in the overall standing, the American is unlikely to remain there in the mountains.</p>
        <p>''I can climb decently when I need to,'' he said, ''but in my first Tour I'm going to take it step by step.''</p>
