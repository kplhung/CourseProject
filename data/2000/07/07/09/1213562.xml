        <p>MUTUAL fund investors received a painful reminder last quarter that there is a third way.</p>
        <p>In the long-running debate between fund managers who search for cheap stocks and those who chase the fastest-growing companies, neither side had reason to cheer. The growth funds that dominated for most of the long bull market for stocks flamed out, but their value-seeking counterparts did not exactly soar from their ash piles. A checking account turned out to be a better place to stash cash than either broad category of stock fund.</p>
        <p>In a quarter when the average fund that invests in large growth companies was down 5.2 percent, the typical large value fund was was off 1.9 percent. As a group, value funds outperformed the overall market for a change, but that was no cause for celebration.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they're breaking out the Champagne and saying, 'We're doing better than growth,' '' said A. Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc. ''They outperformed on a relative basis. The question is, will value outperform on an absolute basis sufficiently well to make it attractive? They're not going to get new assets off these numbers.''</p>
        <p>Still, he noted, a few value-oriented fund managers, including Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company and Wanger Asset Management, agreed to be acquired in the last few weeks, signaling that some big fund companies saw growth prospects in value.</p>
        <p>Among investors, there were long faces all around as the average United States diversified stock fund lost 3.1 percent of its value in the second quarter after gaining more than 7 percent in the first quarter. For the six months, the average stock fund was up 3.7 percent, a pace that is substantially off the historical return of large stocks, 11 percent or so annually since 1926. And it pales in comparison with the 19 percent annualized gain that the average stock fund has racked up during the last five years.</p>
        <p>Many funds that have led the pack for years stumbled during the quarter, as technology stocks fell back to earth. Several funds that had annualized gains of more than 35 percent over the last five years lost more than 10 percent in the quarter, including Fidelity New Millennium, RS Emerging Growth and Janus Twenty.</p>
        <p>The biggest losers among large funds were those with the heaviest concentrations of technology stocks, especially shares of Internet-based start-ups. Putnam OTC Emerging Growth, which raised its technology position to 70 percent in 1999 and rose 125 percent that year, lost 21.2 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Two of the three worst-performing stock funds in the quarter had the word ''Internet'' in their names. The fund at the bottom of the list was the Jacob Internet fund, managed since its December introduction by Ryan Jacob, who previously managed the quarter's third-worst performer, the Kinetics Internet fund. Mr. Jacobs's new fund lost about 37 percent of its value in the quarter and is down slightly more for the year.</p>
        <p>Staying far away from Internet companies and most technology stocks was the key to success for many of the best-performing funds. The biggest gains were in funds that focus on the riskiest or most conservative of sectors. The 11 stock funds that gained more than 20 percent in the quarter specialize in health care stocks, especially biotechnology, or natural resources.</p>
        <p>The favored sectors of 1999, technology and telecommunications, fell to the bottom of the rankings last quarter. Funds that specialized in them lost more than 11 percent, on average. Between those extremes were financial funds, which were down 1.5 percent for the quarter, and utilities funds, which lost 5.2 percent.</p>
        <p>For the Longleaf funds, managed by Southeastern Asset Management of Memphis, an aversion to hot, new things and an unswerving devotion to classic value investing paid off after a long wait.</p>
        <p>''We have not changed the way we do things for the 26 years that we've operated,'' said O. Mason Hawkins, a co-manager of the $3.2 billion Longleaf Partners fund, which gained more than 8 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Helped by buyouts of two companies it owned, Nabisco Holdings and the Pioneer Group, Longleaf Partners gained almost 10 percent in the quarter, ending a string of three losing quarters and making it the top performer among mid-capitalization value funds. Mr. Hawkins described the rebound as an inevitable market recognition of the bargains in the portfolio.</p>
        <p>The biggest contribution came from its No. 1 holding, Waste Management, the garbage-hauling company. With new management tackling the company's accounting and computer problems, Mr. Hawkins said, the stock rose 39 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Still, the turnaround in the performance of Longleaf's funds has not drawn a swarm of investors into the classic value fold. ''We have not had net inflows of any significant amounts in our four funds,'' including the flagship fund that reopened to new investors in February, Mr. Hawkins said with a shrug. But he doesn't rule out the possibility that his second-quarter performance will eventually attract new cash. ''It always seems that investment flows follow performance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In past quarters, of course, some investors left value funds like Longleaf's and chased the fast performance gains logged by growth funds like those managed by Janus Capital in Denver. But the flow has not reversed as once-hot funds have absorbed investment losses in recent months.</p>
        <p>The stronger showing by value funds ''gives some substance to the value people who have this price discipline,'' Mr. Lipper said. But, he said, he doubts that value funds will continue to outperform simply because they own cheap stocks.</p>
        <p>''Things are not cheap enough yet to bring out the arbitragers and the raiders on any sort of mass basis,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Having money spread around the world only compounded the woes of fund investors last quarter. Every foreign stock fund category was a loser.</p>
        <p>International stock funds lost 6.3 percent,  on average, breaking a string of six quarterly gains. As a group, their return over the past year of 25.8 percent, on average, was still better than the 19.2 percent for the typical diversified domestic stock fund.</p>
        <p>Several international funds hung on to 12-month gains of more than 100 percent even though they dropped 13 percent or more last quarter. Among them were Driehaus European Opportunity, BlackRock International Small Cap Equity institutional shares and T. Rowe Price International Discovery. Janus Overseas, with more than $10 billion in assets and an annual return of more than 30 percent for five years, dropped 11.4 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Some of the best-performing international funds in the quarter were more conservative portfolios that specialize in finding undervalued companies or in buying stocks related to gold or other precious metals. Many of the worst-performing international stock funds specialize in companies in Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries. Among international stock funds with at least $1 billion in assets, the worst return was a 18.9 percent loss from Putnam International New Opportunities.</p>
        <p>Europe was the least inhospitable region. Funds that specialize in European stocks lost 5.9 percent, on average, but managed to post a 37.5 percent gain over the past year. Diversified emerging-markets funds dropped 11.7 percent, while Japanese-stock funds lost 11 percent and funds that buy Latin American stocks lost 6.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Among bond funds, emerging markets were the worst place to be. The typical emerging-markets bond portfolio lost 1.2 percent. Most other categories of bond funds had positive returns, one exception being high-yield -- or junk -- bond funds, which lost 0.7 percent.</p>
        <p>''Most bond funds are showing positive numbers but not great positive numbers,'' Mr. Lipper said. As interest rates rose, he said, investors worried about the credit quality of bonds in riskier portfolios, especially those backed by mortgages.</p>
        <p>Although some convertible bond funds had 12-month gains of 25 to 40 percent through June 30, many of those suffered losses in the quarter. One standout for the quarter, however, was the $81 million Victory Convertible Securities fund, which  gained 5.7 percent, and 15.6 percent in the last year.</p>
        <p>Several of the worst-performing bond funds in the quarter and almost all of the worst performers over the last year fell in the high-yield category. The PaineWebber High-Income fund lost more than 10 percent last quarter and almost 16 percent over the last 12 months.</p>
        <p>Municipal bond funds cooled a bit after a hot first quarter, gaining just 1.1 percent, on average. The best recent returns among big muni funds were from the $1.50 billion Vanguard California Insured Long-Term Tax-Exempt and the $1.39 billion Vanguard California Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt, both of which gained 1.8 percent in the quarter.</p>
