        <p>BRUCE D. HOELZEN hasn't given up completely on mutual funds. He still has a few Fidelity index funds, but he has sworn off actively managed funds.  These days, Mr. Hoelzen has four money managers buying individual stocks for him, overseen by his own investment consultant.</p>
        <p>''It's like cruise control on your car,'' said Mr. Hoelzen, 45, a marketing consultant in Atlanta. ''You can drive if you want, or you can put it on 70 and just sit there.'' Usually, he said, he prefers to just sit there and leave it to the professionals.</p>
        <p>Meet the managed account, which many people view as the latest threat to the 76-year-old mutual fund industry. It used to be that only a privileged few could afford their own money manager, but in the last few years assets in privately managed accounts have swelled. Credit, in part, a bull market that has more than doubled the number of millionaire households since 1983, to five million.</p>
        <p>''Our biggest growth area is the managed account area,'' said John F. Sharry, president of the private-client group at Phoenix Investment Partners, which manages $66 billion in mutual funds and private and institutional accounts. Households with $1 million to $5 million to invest are the fastest-growing group he tracks.</p>
        <p>Not that you have to be a millionaire to qualify for a managed account. Today, private portfolio managers serve investors with as little as $50,000, but typically look for at least $100,000 in investable assets. One reason is that technology now allows a single investment professional to manage, in some cases, tens of thousands of individual accounts.</p>
        <p>These managed accounts, known in the industry as ''wraps,'' because  the various fees are combined, reached $451.9 billion in assets at the end of March, up from $160.7 billion at the end of 1996, according to Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm. One type is the mutual fund wrap, in which a consultant advises clients on how best to spread their investments across a slate of funds. But such accounts make up only about a quarter of the wrap market. Privately managed securities accounts, also known as consultant wraps, make up 58 percent of the wrap market, or $262 billion.</p>
        <p>That figure, of course, is well behind the $7 trillion in mutual funds. But consultant wraps are seen as enough of a draw to the fund industry's richest clients that many fund companies are joining the business by offering the services of their top investment managers through managed-account programs run by third parties. In return, the fund companies receive a portion of the annual fee, averaging 2.25 percent, charged by wrap accounts. (By comparison, the average annual fee charged by mutual funds is 1.60 percent.)</p>
        <p>''I think in five years every major mutual fund company will also have a line of individually managed accounts,'' said Leonard A. Reinhart, chairman of the Lockwood Financial Group, a consulting firm, at a recent industry briefing.</p>
        <p>Most consultant wraps work like this: Clients visit an investment adviser, whether a big broker like Salomon Smith Barney or a small independent. With the guidance of an investment consultant, clients then pick among scores of investment managers from different firms. Usually clients spread their money into several accounts and asset classes and then leave much of the monitoring and managing to the consultants.</p>
        <p>Generally, the average wrap investor has a net worth of about $1 million and invests in a mix of accounts for diversification. At most big brokerage firms, minimums don't come much lower than $100,000. But a new batch of Internet-based financial companies, like WrapManager.com and PrivateAccounts.com, are offering lower minimums and lower fees for private accounts, though usually without the additional advice of investment consultants.</p>
        <p>All of the programs allow investors to make direct investments in stocks, in contrast to mutual funds. This lets clients avoid particular stocks that they may already hold in other accounts. In the case of Mr. Hoelzen, a client of Phoenix Investment Partners, he alerted his consultant that he had worked for 12 years at I.B.M. and already had a big position in the stock.</p>
        <p>But the chief consideration for many clients, including Mr. Hoelzen, is taxes, or how best to avoid them. One drawback of mutual funds cited by managed-account boosters is that investors sometimes foot tax bills that are instigated by others. For instance, if a hot-performing fund suffers withdrawals, investors who stay are stuck with a larger tax burden as the fund sells assets to meet redemptions. Another problem is that investors may buy into funds that turn out to be tax traps, because they already have large taxable capital gains on the books.</p>
        <p>Such issues do not affect managed accounts; wrap clients can also take defensive measures, like selling losing positions in one account to offset gains in others, thus reducing tax bills. About 10 percent to 15 percent of Merrill Lynch managed-account clients order their money managers to take tax-related actions during the year, said Alan Sislen, an executive at Merrill who oversees its separate-accounts program.</p>
        <p>''We really believe that clients have the best chance of success if they go into these very disciplined programs,'' Mr. Sislen said. They certainly work for Merrill -- its private account business has more than doubled, to $52.6 billion at the end of March from $27.3 billion at the end of 1998. By comparison, the firm's fund unit has suffered nearly $2.8 billion in net withdrawals in just the first four months of this year.</p>
        <p>Fund companies including Invesco, Munder Capital and Navellier already offer the services of their managers through separate account programs, and recently MFS Investments, Oppenheimer and Pilgrim Baxter announced plans to enter the business.</p>
        <p>But some of the largest fund companies are noncommittal. While Fidelity's brokerage unit offers separate account services, its vaunted fund management team does not participate. A company spokesman said Fidelity had no plans to introduce any such services. Likewise, Janus Capital, one of the industry's hottest money management firms,  does not offer its management talent through separate account programs. Nor does the Vanguard Group.</p>
        <p>''We believe that you don't need separate accounts to get diversification and tax efficiency,'' says Joel M. Dickson, a tax expert at Vanguard. The firm's five tax-efficient funds, Mr. Dickson says, are an alternative for clients sensitive to tax needs.</p>
        <p>BUT for Mr. Hoelzen, easy tax management is one of the best benefits of his managed accounts. While he says he generally doesn't think much about his accounts, he pays more attention in December.</p>
        <p>''Typically, at the end of the year I'll ask them to sell every loss position that's over $50,'' he says. ''You have considerable control over your taxation, so I never get those checks with a huge capital gains distribution.''</p>
