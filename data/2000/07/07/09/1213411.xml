        <p>KEEPING a low profile comes naturally to Ananta P. Mukherjee, the owner of Colonial Wines and Liquors on Main Street, which he bought in 1997. Both by temperament and by life experience, Mr. Mukherjee, who is known as Tony, has relied more on hard work than on stirring the pot.</p>
        <p>But all that changed when Mr. Mukherjee, who is 57 and a native of Calcutta, recently petitioned the Chamber of Commerce and the Port Washington Police Department to correct a situation that he says is hurting his business: a forbidding No Parking sign in front of his store.</p>
        <p>The parking ban, he says, hampers the drivers who deliver his stock 10 times a week. Customers are sometimes unable to pick up large orders without getting tickets.</p>
        <p>Many neighboring storekeepers have the same complaint, but none have been as determined as Mr. Mukherjee to change the status quo.</p>
        <p>Unlike many immigrants, who may come from societies where aggressive action is frowned upon, or who may avoid public discourse because they are embarrassed by their imperfect English, Mr. Mukherjee -- perhaps emboldened by the maelstrom of political activity characteristic of Long Island -- comes to his current mission from a background of trailblazing action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukherjee first demonstrated a flair for independence when he graduated from high school and left his parents and seven siblings in Calcutta to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering in Manchester, England.</p>
        <p>Although his family was accomplished -- two brothers are lawyers and another a plastic surgeon, his four sisters graduated from college and his father and paternal grandfather were renowned lawyers -- he thought a degree from an English school ''would help me fulfill my childhood dream of going abroad and pursuing my ambitions.''</p>
        <p>After paying his own way through school and graduating, he looked for jobs in England, but a petroleum crisis and widespread job layoffs made prospects there grim. He sought the help of the United Nations, which referred him to the International Committee for European Migration to Latin America. Within months, he was working for General Motors in Sao Paolo, Brazil.</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Shiuli, who is also from Calcutta, had three children, but when their eldest, a boy, was on the threshold of college, Mr. Mukherjee decided that colleges in Brazil were not for his children, and he sent his son to Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
        <p>''I wanted my children to have the kind of opportunities to prosper that are only offered by the American dream,'' he said. ''I knew that they would grow in America's increasingly diverse society and that being U.S. citizens, along with their ability to speak different languages, would open many doors to them in this global world.'' The Mukherjee children speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Bengali.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukherjee's aspirations derive in large part from early experiences. Born in 1943, during one of India's worst famines, he remembers vividly the tales his family told of the conflict between Britain and Japan, and of having to flee Japanese bombing raids in Calcutta to a village in what is now Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>''My father always believed in the concept of simple living and high thinking,'' he said. ''And my wife and I also believe that it is better to live modestly and put a greater emphasis on education and the preservation of our cultural heritage.''</p>
        <p>After their son began studying in Texas, the Mukherjees moved to New York, living first in Huntington, then in Texas, and finally moving to Port Washington. Mr. Mukherjee had done well in Brazil, but ''I spent a lot of my savings trying to make a life here,'' he said. ''It wasn't easy, but I never experienced any discrimination, thank God.''</p>
        <p>''I went to the library every day,'' he said, ''looking in the newspapers for jobs. I calculated my family's needs, but I was already in my 50's and it was difficult. I saw that jobs like working in a newsstand or gas station or repairing cars wouldn't earn me enough money to educate my children. When I saw an ad for a liquor store that I could afford, I bought it.''</p>
        <p>His travels in Brazil and Europe for General Motors had given him the opportunity to visit several wine regions. ''I've always been interested in wines,'' he said, adding that he drinks two glasses of wine each night (and runs four miles every day), ''so learning about other kinds of liquors was interesting to me too.''</p>
        <p>The Mukherjees, who are Hindu, have permanent resident status. After five years' residence in the United States, they will be eligible to apply for citizenship.</p>
        <p>Learning about parking bans has also been instructive. When the response to his complaints to the Chamber of Commerce and the police department proved less than encouraging, Mr. Mukherjee wrote a letter to his community newspaper, suggesting that the shopkeepers ''work out a series of compromises'' with officials.</p>
        <p>When the letter initially yielded no response other than encouraging words from neighbors, he circulated a petition that he plans to present to May Newburger, the Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukherjee has rallied like-minded neighboring storekeepers, including Linda Yau, the owner of the Lucky Star Chinese takeout restaurant, and Kenny Louie, the owner of Hime, a Japanese restaurant, who said: ''There's no reason trucks can't park in front for 5 or 10 minutes. It makes sense.''</p>
        <p>The police chief, William J. Kilfoil, while acknowledging ''there's definitely a problem,'' explained that when people park in the heavily trafficked area in front of Mr. Mukherjee's store, ''traffic backs up eastbound and parking there creates a dangerous situation for motorists and pedestrians, the worse stop on Main Street.''</p>
        <p>''We do the best we can, but there's no easy solution,'' added Chief Kilfoil, who once walked patrol on Main Street. ''Maybe this can be worked out with the town, but sometimes delivery people just have to use hand trucks like they do in the City. If someone's parking there, we'll tell them to move. But if they don't, it's a $25 ticket.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mukherjee's efforts may soon pay off. In the words of Warren Schein, the president of the Chamber of Commerce for nine years, ''We have to help each other so the community is a better place to live.''</p>
        <p>To that end Mr. Schein, who is also the deputy commissioner of parks and recreation for the Town of North Hempstead, which runs the Port Washington Parking District, said he had proposed a ''red meter zone'' to allow commercial vehicles to park for deliveries from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I've seen this in Great Neck and Glen Cove and the Hamptons, and it works,'' Mr. Schein said. ''This would make it easier for storekeepers to do business, for shoppers to avoid double-parking and having to drive around double-parked trucks, and for truck drivers who won't have to hunt for spots.''</p>
        <p>The plan is subject to town board approval, ''but I'm sure it will be approved,'' Mr. Schein said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime Mr. Mukherjee continues to collect signatures on his petition and to deliver to customers who tell him they do not have the time or patience to find a parking spot near his store. And he and his wife continue to work hard to support their children.</p>
        <p>Their elder son, Shoummo, a graduate of Hofstra University, now works in the financial department of Citibank. Their daughter, Shilpi, studies computer graphics at SUNY Stony Brook. Their younger son, Sergio, a recent graduate of Schreiber High School in Port Washington, will attend Cornell University in the fall.</p>
        <p>As for his foray into community politics, Mr. Mukherjee said: ''Apathy is the great enemy of our society. I believe in the American way of life, being thankful for every freedom, and also having the right and the privilege of trying to redress a grievance.''</p>
        <p>A Diverse Island</p>
        <p>Articles in this series are looking beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native-born Long Islanders. Future articles will examine immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric. Previous articles examined the lives and aspirations of Muslims on the Island, a Korean entrepreneur and her American-raised son, and a Colombian landscaping entrepreneur.</p>
