      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Dave Matthews Band is a bona fide music phenomenon, with a fan base that has been consistently growing to the point where they now sell out multiple stadium performances. Taking on a Deadhead quality as far as cultish devotion, the band fuses rock and jazz with folk, blues and country roots, and has become a grass roots favorite with countless fan clubs, Internet fan sites and bootleg albums.</p>
        <p>Touring incessantly and fronted by the rich, edgy (and sometimes unintelligible) vocals of Mr. Matthews, one of rock's most commanding vocalists, the Dave Matthews Band has released high-quality albums that feature percolating beats, rigorous guitarwork, gorgeous melodies and an imposing horn section.</p>

        <p>When the band plays its sold-out concerts at Giants Stadium on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night, expect music from all their albums -- 1994's ''Under the Table and Dreaming,'' 1996's ''Crash,'' and 1998's ''Before These Crowded Streets.'' But don't expect anything to sound like their two live discs, released last year -- ''Listener Supported'' and ''Live at Luther College.'' They never play anything the same way twice.</p>
