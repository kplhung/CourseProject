        <p>I scratched my head a little when I first saw ''The Lyricist Lounge Show,'' the half-hour hip-hop comedy show that had its premeiredebuted on MTV earlier this year and began its second season on June 20.</p>
        <p>In one sketch from the show's first episode, the rapper Mos Def plays a man about to jump off a building's ledge before a policeman, played by Wordsworth, the show's resident rapper-comedian, climbs out the window and begins talking him back inside.

        <p>I scratched my head a little when I first saw ''The Lyricist Lounge Show,'' the half-hour hip-hop comedy show that had its premeiredebuted on MTV earlier this year and began its second season on June 20.</p>
        <p>In one sketch from the show's first episode, the rapper Mos Def plays a man about to jump off a building's ledge before a policeman, played by Wordsworth, the show's resident rapper-comedian, climbs out the window and begins talking him back inside. It's a familiar television scenario in every way except for the hip-hop beat that suddenly kicks in.</p>
        <p>''Look, life ain't perfect,'' the policeman says, or rather, raps.</p>
        <p>''Don't try to convince me!'' the jumper replies. ''You don't know what it's like trying to be a thespian.''</p>
        <p>''A lesbian?''</p>
        <p>''I said a thespian! Don't stress me, friend.! All I ever wanted to do was act. I went on a thousand auditions. They ain't never called me back!''</p>
        <p>(Eventually the policeman coaxes Mos Def off the ledge by telling him that ''Lyricist Lounge'' auditions will begin any minute.)</p>
        <p>In sketches from the show's second season, a wrongly convicted prisoner (played by Ceelo, a guest performer) raps his way all the way to the electric chair, ''Big-Daddy Edison'' introduces his bodyguard, 'H-Deuce-O,'' to a class of rapt students, a mother (Healther McDonald) sings the praises of cybersex to her son and friends, and quiz show contestants (Wordsworth and Master Fuol) compete in a raplike series of hints and guesses for a grand prize of $25, in check form.</p>
        <p>Is this the same Lyricist Lounge that has been putting on underground hip-hop concerts in New York City and around the country for nine years now? The same Lyricist Lounge that introduced to the world raw talents like the Notorious B.I.G., Foxy Brown, Mobb Deep, Rah Digga, even Mos Def?</p>
        <p>Actually, it is. The show was created and developed, with the help of MTV, by the four young entrepreneurs of MIC Media (average age: 26), who started Lyricist Lounge as a hip-hop open mic in a loft on Orchard Street, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in 1991. Since those days the concept has been expanded into a record label, a national tour, and now a television show.</p>
        <p>So why does the show resemble a raunchy version of ''Rowan &amp; Martin's Laugh-In'' or ''Hee Haw'' far more than a Busta Rhymes video?</p>
        <p>''Hip-hop tends to take itself very seriously most of the time, but with the show we're trying to give artists a chance to be silly,'' says Jacob Septimus, a MIC Media partner, at a sushi lunch recently in midtown Manhattan. ''And hip-hop's really about sampling every part of pop culture. You can see the show as coming out of street culture, but it's also from musicals, like 'Guys and Dolls.' It's really a street musical.''</p>
        <p>Anthony Marshall, a founding member, adds: ''It reminds me of Carol Burnett, when I was younger,'' adds Anthony Marshall, a founding member. ''It would go from a musical aspect to a comedy aspect. But in terms of hip-hop, this kind of thing hasn't been done before.''</p>
        <p>It hasn't been done exactly like this, true, but the show has earned comparisons to ''In Living Colour'' for its irreverent, urban approach and multiethnic cast.</p>
        <p>''We even had meetings specifically to figure out how to avoid people saying it's like 'In Living Colour,' '' Mr. Septimus says. ''But it's inevitable when you do a variety show, especially an urban variety show, that people are going to compare it. There's nothing else to compare it to.''</p>
        <p>Except, perhaps, to another version of itself. MIC Media is already planning the next step in the evolution of Lyricist Lounge, and it will involve nationwide open-mic centers linked by the Internet.</p>
        <p>''It's just the next level,'' says Mr. Marshall. ''That's what we gotta do.''</p>
