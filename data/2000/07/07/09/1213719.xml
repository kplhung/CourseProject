        <p>Steve Flesch and Brian Henninger liked their positions, but Tiger Woods did not like his.</p>
        <p>After today's third round of the Advil Western Open, Woods, the world's No. 1 player, was missing from a tightly bunched leader board. It will take a comeback of major proportions for Woods, the defending champion, to win at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club for the third time in four years. Plagued by putting problems, Woods was six strokes off the lead, tied for 23rd place and clearly not playing his best.</p>
        <p>So, if Woods does not win, who will?</p>
        <p>That question remained wide open heading into a final round that will be highly competitive and unpredictable.</p>
        <p>Flesch had three bogeys on his last seven holes and shot a 68 and Henninger bogeyed the 18th hole to finish his third-round 70.They shared the lead at 13 under par (203), but 16 players were bunched between 13 under and 9 under. Lee Janzen, a two-time United States Open winner, was alone in third place at 204 after a six-under 66.</p>
        <p>Nick Price, Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry were tied at 11 under par. Robert Allenby and Shigeki Maruyama were 10 under, while eight players were at nine under -- Stephen Ames, Stuart Appleby, Mike Brisky, Bill Glasson, Steve Lowery, Carl Paulson, David Toms and Mark Wiebe.</p>
        <p>With Woods struggling, by his standards, the contenders sensed an opportunity to capitalize.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wants to win,'' said Janzen, who has won just once, at the 1998 United States Open, in the last five years. ''It seems like we're playing for fewer spots the way Tiger has played. Maybe that's why guys are playing better this week.</p>
        <p>''If I can play aggressively tomorrow, even with mistakes, I'd be happy with the same score. If you're going to keep up, you have to make birdies. So you might as well fire at the pin.''</p>
        <p>Three players equaled the course record (63) during the first two rounds, but the greens were firmer today, and scoring became more difficult. Perry shot 68, Furyk shot 69, and Price shot 70. Meanwhile, several players hurt themselves with poor rounds, like Fred Couples (73) and Franklin Langham (74), who were tied at 208.</p>
        <p>As for Woods, he shot a third-round 70 that was unusually inconsistent. Woods bogeyed two par-5 holes today -- No. 9 and No. 15, and he continued to miss putts that prevented him from building momentum. Afterward he said he was frustrated about his inability to make putts.</p>
        <p>''I need a Seeing Eye dog out there,'' said Woods, playing his last tournament before the British Open later this month. ''I'm putting so bad, it's a joke. I need to play well tomorrow, at least, so going to the British I have something to take away from this tournament.</p>
        <p>''If I play well, I have a chance of winning. If I don't play well, I'm so far behind, I have no chance.''</p>
        <p>While the huge gallery following Woods did not have much to cheer about, there was plenty of action around the course.</p>
        <p>Flesch, 33, a left-hander looking for his first PGA Tour victory, stormed into the picture with an eagle at No. 5, which moved him to 10 under par.</p>
        <p>Flesch is often called the best player on tour who has never won. He has eight top-10 finishes this year, tied for third on tour behind Woods (10) and Jesper Parnevik (9). Sunday could finally be Flesch's turn to break through, and he ended the day on a high note, when his 12-foot birdie putt at No. 18 hung on the lip for three seconds, then fell into the cup.</p>
        <p>''I think I'm ready to win, but I can't force it,'' Flesch said. ''I didn't really hit the ball that well today, but I was able to shoot a good score. Usually in every tournament, you have at least one day when you don't hit the ball that well. So I was happy to get through today.''</p>
        <p>With so many players in contention, the leaders will spend as much time reading the scoreboard Sunday as they will reading putts.</p>
        <p>''Somebody's going to break out of the pack and throw up a good score, and the other guys are going to have to chase him,'' Furyk said. ''I'm going to have to shoot at least 66 if I want a chance to win.''</p>
        <p>So unlike the United States Open last month, where Woods was the lone player to finish under par, Sunday's final round will bring out the birdies.</p>
        <p>It was nearly impossible to predict a winner. But at least nobody would win by 15 strokes.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a shootout, which everyone wants, I suppose,'' Price said. ''Nobody's going to run away with this one.''</p>
