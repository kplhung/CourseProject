        <p>Life was anything but tranquil at the Tiemann Oasis last week.</p>
        <p>After 17 years of serving up roti, burritos and social activism, the owner of the tiny Middle Eastern and Mexican restaurant has lost his lease and his doors are padlocked. Many residents are angry because the owner, Saad Kadhim, and his restaurant have been neighborhood fixtures. But his landlord, the board of 40 Tiemann Place, a co-operative next door, said he routinely paid his rent late and left a longstanding debt unpaid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kadhim, 48, was told in March that his lease would not be renewed, and he was ordered to close his business by June 30. While he tried to negotiate with the co-op board, his unhappy patrons held nightly ''percussion protests,'' banging pots and using maracas and chanting, ''No lease, no peace,'' to no avail.</p>
        <p>''It's devastating to me,'' said Mr. Kadhim, a native Iraqi who opened the Oasis 20 years ago. ''I don't even want to believe it. This is my home. I love these people.''</p>
        <p>They loved him back. Customers called Mr. Kadhim a neighborhood hero. A gregarious, scruffy-headed activist, he is popular for running informal rent clinics in the restaurant and offering a carefree hangout.</p>
        <p>''He was the glue of the community,'' said Lisa Arkis, a musician and a 10-year resident. ''He brought everyone together in a wildly unique way. We have no place now.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kadhim the good neighbor was also a difficult tenant, according to Kathryn Graybill, a former member of the co-op board. Besides paying his $1,085 monthly rent late on occasion, she said he owed $5,000 stemming from the time he sublet the Oasis to a friend who defaulted on the lease. The debt remains.</p>
        <p>''He has not behaved like a hero to this building,'' Ms. Graybill said. ''We're just not working well together, and it's time our paths diverged.''</p>
        <p>Alan Freedman, the board's lawyer, said: ''This is merely a case of a person's lease being expired. That's an everyday thing here.''</p>
