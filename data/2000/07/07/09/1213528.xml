        <p>It was instructional to read that the big developers' group -- we call it the Association to Blacktop Long Island -- has brought its campaign as far as East Hampton.</p>
        <p>Desmond Ryan's letter [''Anti-Ross School Cartoon Picked the Wrong Target,'' July 2] on the opposition by the Pine Barrens Society and by me to the 50-building, 484,000-square-foot expansion of the Ross School entirely misses the point.</p>
        <p>Our cartoon and radio satire focuses not on children but on the so-called grown-ups who have declared that they are bulldozing the Pine Barrens in a state-designated Special Groundwater Protection Area to teach children environmental appreciation (in the words of their environmental impact statement).</p>
        <p>We have not apologized for our reaction to this preposterous premise or to the biggest development ever proposed on the South Fork. It is the Ross School and the development-at-any-cost crowd that should apologize.</p>
