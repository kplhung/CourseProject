        <p>With her bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr and her master's in art history from Columbia, Starr Figura may not seem at first glance like someone who would be a diehard union supporter.</p>
        <p>But 10 weeks into the strike at the Museum of Modern Art, Ms. Figura, an assistant curator in the prints and illustrations department, said that she was ready to spend another 10 weeks picketing if that was what it took to ensure that her health coverage would not be cut.</p>
        <p>''The museum's behavior over the last several months is the definition of bad-faith bargaining,'' Ms. Figura said while picketing alongside a dozen other strikers. ''They haven't negotiated with us at all. Unfortunately, what the strike has demonstrated is the museum doesn't have a lot of respect for its junior staff.''</p>
        <p>Although the dispute involves assistant curators, librarians, archivists and many other workers not fitting labor's traditional blue-collar mold, the strike has turned into a classic labor showdown, albeit with some highbrow grace notes. (In a bow to the museum's many foreign visitors, the union's fliers are translated into French, Italian, Spanish and German.)</p>
        <p>Each side ridicules the other, accusing the other of bargaining in bad faith, and neither side gives any indication of blinking. Management is subtly pressuring strikers to abandon the union and return to work.  Eager not to be outmaneuvered, the union, Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers, has its own pressure tactics, including putting up picket lines with the hope of slowing, and maybe even stopping, the Modern's ambitious $650 million expansion project.</p>
        <p>By several measures, the strike does not appear to be going well for the union. As of last week, according to the museum, more than half of the 250 employees in the bargaining unit had crossed the picket line.</p>
        <p>''This says the union doesn't have the support of the bargaining unit in its role as bargaining representative,'' said Robert Batterman, a lawyer with Proskauer Rose and the museum's chief negotiator. ''They are not doing what a majority thinks should be done.''</p>
        <p>In another setback to the union, attendance has not lagged, museum officials say, notwithstanding the dozen or so strikers who stand out front each day, urging tourists not to visit and clanging metal rods against police barricades. Accusing museum officials of lying, many union members say they are sure attendance is down.</p>
        <p>By some other measures, the strike appears to be going well. Those picketing out front vow that they are in for the long haul. Pressures from the workers, who are represented by the Auto Workers' white-collar branch, have led the museum to cancel its free summer jazz concerts and to postpone several movie screenings and a fund-raiser starring the singer Sheryl Crow.</p>
        <p>Other New York unions have pledged support, but a major question is whether construction unions will honor the picket line later this month when work on the museum's expansion is scheduled to begin.</p>
        <p>The union's leaders are constantly mapping strategies to squeeze more of the museum's pressure points. One such strategy was apparent in a letter, written at the Auto Workers' request, that James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, sent to Goldman Sachs, asserting that the investment bank was promoting unfair working conditions by underwriting $250 million in bonds for the Modern's expansion. Mr. Hoffa wrote that the union was reviewing its accounts with Goldman Sachs, including several billion dollars in Teamster pension funds that the bank manages.</p>
        <p>The museum and union remain divided on several basic issues, including pay, health coverage and job security. But after 10 weeks, an unspoken obstacle is greatly impeding a settlement -- the growing hostility and distrust felt by both sides. The two sides are so divided, showing so little room for flexibility, that a federal mediator has not called them together for face-to-face talks since the strike began April 28.</p>
        <p>Museum officials defend their pay scale as comparable to that at other art museums. Union members say that is not good enough, considering how rich and prestigious the Modern is and considering that the museum has collected more than $100 million for its expansion.</p>
        <p>The workers' pay averages $28,000 a year, ranging from $17,000 for bookshop workers to more than $50,000 for some associate curators. Those at both ends of the scale assert  that they are underpaid.</p>
        <p>Ms. Figura said, ''I've been working here seven years, and I make just $39,000. We stay late many nights and come in many weekends to work on exhibitions, and we are never paid overtime. Because we're professionals and dedicated, they expect us to help subsidize the museum through our low salaries.''</p>
        <p>Sheila Ubilla, who was promoted last March after spending four years earning $17,000 a year at the museum's design store, had different complaints about pay. ''This is New York City, and it's hard to pay your rent when you're making $17,000 a year,'' said Ms. Ubilla, who is a junior at Hunter College.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman, the museum lawyer, defended the $17,000 annual pay for bookstore and visitors' services jobs, saying workers who hold those jobs are not career professionals, but usually recent college graduates who leave for other opportunities after a year or two. He said the $8.50 an hour the bookstore workers earned was comparable to what many New York bookstores paid, but he said the Modern provided far better vacation and health benefits.</p>
        <p>Management has offered a 3 percent raise each year for three years, while the union demanded 5 percent in the first year and 4 percent in the second and third years. The union wants the museum's $17,000 minimum salary to rise immediately to $20,000.</p>
        <p>Health coverage is one of the most hotly contested issues. The museum has told the union that if it insisted on exercising the right to bargain over changes in the health plan, then the museum would want to push the union's members out of the health plan they now share with management personnel.</p>
        <p>Union officials say the museum is maneuvering to push the workers into a worse health plan, which might mean higher premiums and deductibles. Museum officials insist they have no such strategy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batterman insisted that the main obstacle to a settlement was the union's demand that all newly hired workers be required to join the union or, if they choose not to join, to pay union dues. That arrangement is known as an agency shop. Throughout the museum union's 30-year history, its administrative and professional workers have not had to join the union or pay dues. When the union went on strike in April, about 90 of the 250 workers in the bargaining unit were not in the union.</p>
        <p>Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, said an agency shop was needed to strengthen a historically weak union. But Mr. Batterman asserted that the agency shop demands were prolonging the strike and were designed largely to increase the union leaders' power.</p>
        <p>''There has always been a meaningful number of people in this bargaining unit who do not buy into this concept,'' Mr. Batterman said. ''That's why they're not out there on the picket line.''</p>
        <p>Many union members defend the agency shop demand and assert that management's hard line on that issue and health coverage is a pretext for seeking to break the union -- something Mr. Batterman angrily denies. He said the museum had good relations with its six other unions.</p>
