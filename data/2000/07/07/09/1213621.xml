        <p>When Queen Elizabeth II knighted Sean Connery in his hometown, Edinburgh, the actor called the occasion ''one of the proudest days of my life.'' Shame on him. Didn't Mr. Connery know that for James Bond, the legendary superspy he portrayed in seven movies, the prospect of a knighthood was as horrifying as that of a vodka martini stirred, not shaken?</p>
        <p>In ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1965), the last James Bond novel written by the character's creator, Ian Fleming, Bond is recommended for a knighthood -- specifically, the Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George (K.C.M.G.) -- but declines the honor.</p>
        <p>''He had never been a public figure,'' Fleming wrote, ''and he did not wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters after one's name, or before it. But there was one thing above all he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To become a public person, a person, in the snobbish world of England, of any country, who would be called upon to open things, lay foundation stones, make after-dinner speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits.''</p>
        <p>So in a telegram to M., the head of the British Secret Service, Bond writes, ''EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS FEEL AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW COMMA SIR COMMA THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR INDULGENCE.''</p>
        <p>007, being a Scottish spy, also had a Scottish reason for spurning a knighthood. In a sentence that he ultimately strikes from his telegram, Bond says: ''MY PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE DONT WANT TO PAY MORE AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.''</p>
        <p>Bond, presumably, has helped make Mr. Connery so wealthy that he no longer has to worry about such things.</p>
