        <p>Leaders of the Episcopal Church and the nation's largest Lutheran denomination said that their historic alliance, which was concluded today at the Episcopalians' 73rd general convention, begins an era of ecumenical outreach that could lead them to engage other churches in similar efforts of sharing resources and personnel.</p>

        <p>Leaders of the Episcopal Church and the nation's largest Lutheran denomination said that their historic alliance, which was concluded today at the Episcopalians' 73rd general convention, begins an era of ecumenical outreach that could lead them to engage other churches in similar efforts of sharing resources and personnel.</p>
        <p>But the leaders also conceded that the alliance, ''Called to Common Mission,'' could play a significant role in helping the churches stem steady declines in membership caused by aging congregations, the appeal of new large churches and the feeling by some that their church no longer serves their needs.</p>
        <p>The falloff has been especially acute in the Episcopal Church, which in 1998, the last year for which statistics are available, had 2.3 million baptized members, about a third fewer than the 3.6 million in its peak year, 1965. Its partner in the alliance, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, has suffered a milder decline, to 5.1 million in 1998 from 5.2 million in 1987, the year that three Lutheran denominations merged to form the current church.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say the motivation to be enthusiastic about full communion is because of some numerical measure,'' said Rustin Kimsey, a retired Episcopal bishop from The Dalles, Ore., referring to the accord. ''But it will help. We're already strong because of the conversations we've had with the Lutherans. There is always strength in numbers.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Lowell G. Almen of Chicago, secretary of the Lutheran denomination, also dismissed any suggestion that the alliance was spurred by falling membership. But he said the alliance could, at the least, help stabilize membership and perhaps, help the churches grow.</p>
        <p>''The more primary question is greater effectiveness and witness to the Gospel,'' Mr. Almen said of the collaboration. ''But it may well result in growth and care for God's people throughout our communities.''</p>
        <p>The alliance between the two churches followed approval by the Lutherans three years ago, the Episcopal House of Bishops on Friday and today's vote by the Episcopal House of Deputies, which was overwhelming, 190 to 23.</p>
        <p>It was intended as a way to improve the economies of scale for both denominations. In addition to recognizing similar theologies and liturgies, the alliance provides a way for each church to offer the other its resources in areas of need and to work together on outreach programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Almen said that would be most apparent in communities, as well as on college campuses, where one church might have limited personnel or a lack of facilities.</p>
        <p>For Episcopalians, the issue of membership is crucial. The Rev. David Perry of Manhattan, deputy for ecumenical relations, said one of the problems the Episcopal Church had encountered was how to retain young people as members.</p>
        <p>''There is the issue of how we have been committed to young people,'' Mr. Perry said. ''We have not always provided a continuous environment for them after Sunday school. When they reach their 20's and 30's, they don't come to church. They may wander back later, but we have not created the atmosphere for them to stay.''</p>
        <p>A small but growing number of parishes are beginning to address the problem by tailoring services to appeal to young adults. Some are even using rock music.</p>
        <p>Another problem has been the growing appeal of large churches, which draw thousands of people to Sunday services. These churches, which tend to attract Christians of all denominations, have played at least  some role in the declining memberships of the Episcopalians and Lutherans, although not enough yet, leaders of both churches said, to be of major concern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Almen said: ''The whole phenomenon of megachurches, from every church leader I've dealt with, in one sense rejoices. Yet they also wonder about the long-term impact of nurturing and grounding people in the faith of the church.''</p>
        <p>But he and his Episcopal colleagues agreed that the alliance would be a major step toward enhancing the religious experience of church members and by the new collaboration, attracting others in their communities to join them.</p>
        <p>''We have a new energy and enthusiasm,'' Bishop Kimsey said of the alliance with the Lutherans. ''The Episcopal Church has broken open to some new ways to look at other communions and ecumenical possibilities by this.''</p>
        <p>''And there is always,'' he added, ''strength in numbers.''</p>
