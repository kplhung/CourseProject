        <p>ON the night that Vicente Fox Quesada wrested control of the Mexican presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, the  jubilant victor rushed out to celebrate with throngs of supporters who had gathered at the monument of the Angel of Independence in the capital.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of miles away in a rural village in the eastern state of Veracruz, a small group of potato farmers gathered around a black-and-white television set to watch grainy images of the celebration. Sometimes it was hard for them to hear Mr. Fox above the chants from the crowd around him. But what the crowd had to say came through loud and clear. ''Vicente no nos falles,'' the televised crowd blared.</p>
        <p>''Vicente, don't fail us.''</p>
        <p>The words stirred the farmers in Veracruz, and they picked up the chant. That simple plea, said one  farmer, summed up the deep sense of betrayal people have long felt toward their government and their desperation for change. But there was also an edgy challenge in the plea.</p>
        <p>Mexicans will no longer hand over their votes and expect little in return, the farmers said. And what they most expect from Mr. Fox are programs and reforms that will help the nation's new democracy expand beyond elections.</p>
        <p>At the moment of their greatest expectation, however, some voters do not quite realize that the new president's powers have also been radically reshaped --  in some ways weakened -- by some of the same currents that carried him to victory. He is not part of the one-party apparatus that for 71 years monopolized power in Mexico but so often failed its people.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Fox has made a lot of promises to the people, that he would move the country forward,'' said Alvaro Gonzalez Arenas, 24. ''We have put our faith in him; faith that we are finally going to be free of corruption and that we will be able to live with dignity.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the first step in the development of a democracy -- free and fair elections -- was accomplished here last Sunday in contests that displayed an extraordinary level of civility and respect.</p>
        <p>But democracy, as shown from Central America to the former Soviet Union, requires more than fair elections. Those in power must prove able to work in cooperation with their opponents. In Mr. Fox's case, only then can he take on Mexico's urgent tasks: creating a credible justice system that protects civilians from crime and corruption, and anti-poverty programs to lift the poor; and opening education and employment opportunities to the best and the brightest, rather than the best and most well-connected. Such goals are extraordinarily complex, of course, and have been set before.</p>
        <p>''People have felt so betrayed by promises from candidates that were never intended to be fulfilled and they not only stopped believing in the government, but they stopped believing in themselves,'' said Julio Faesler, a congressman and member of Mr. Fox's National Action Party. ''It took a great leap of faith, and a lot of internal courage for people to trust in something other than the PRI. And living up to that confidence will not be easy.''</p>
        <p>Showing that he plans to work hard to fulfill his campaign promises, Mr. Fox has barely taken a moment to rest since his victory. But when he assumes power on Dec. 1, some analysts say he will be in a weaker position than his PRI predecessors. He will not have the support of the vast PRI machinery -- its political bosses, its labor union and farmers' cooperative leaders and the directors of the wealthiest social welfare programs. These were an important part of the muscle that could support, and often impose, the will of a PRI president.</p>
        <p>And, unlike all PRI presidents until the midterm elections in 1997, Mr. Fox will not be able to count on  enough votes in Congress to override his opposition. He will have to reach for support across party lines.</p>
        <p>''He has to be a statesman and a mobilizer and an organizer of the Mexican people,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, an expert on Latin American politics and a professor of law at Harvard University. ''If he fails to do that, he will allow the powerful organized interests to strike back at him, and to limit the margin of innovation for his government, and to create the stage on which a new opposition to his government can arise.''</p>
        <p>During his campaign, Mr. Fox was brash and prone to hurling insults, and he paid a price: he could not  establish partnerships with logical allies, particularly the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Mangabeira said those are mostly ''superficial weaknesses,'' because Mr. Fox was elected president by a decisive margin in the midst of a national feeling of rebirth. The challenge will be whether he can  turn the enthusiasm into bold political practice.</p>
        <p>One political analyst, Federico Estevez of the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, said Mr. Fox is uniquely well suited for the challenges ahead -- primarily because he is much more a pragmatist than an ideologue. For example, he is a devout Catholic who  has said he personally opposes abortion but has also said he would consider signing legislation to legalize the procedure if he thought it reflected the will of most Mexicans.</p>
        <p>AND even though the president-elect could not win over all of the Mexican left, he was able to lure several strategists from the main leftist party to his campaign. In choosing his cabinet, Mr. Fox plans to enlist international headhunting firms, and he has promised to make his government one that reflects the range of Mexico's political parties and regions.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Fox, who once managed the sale of Coca-Cola across Latin America, has used his marketing experience to promote his image and ideas. ''He is a magnificent salesman,'' Mr. Estevez said. ''And on top of that, he knows how to inspire people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox has already signaled that he may use the first months of his administration to push for approval of some of his most controversial proposals. Last week, he announced plans to rebuild the nation's federal law enforcement system. And he said he would travel to the United States to press for a less restricted flow of Mexican workers across the border.</p>
        <p>''He announces his plans ahead of time,'' said Mr. Estevez, ''something that shows he's already treating the public to the kind of transparent agenda they expect of him, and one that they would have never gotten before under the PRI.''</p>
        <p>Even one of Mr. Fox's closest campaign advisers worried, though, about whether public expectations had been set too high. ''Feelings of optimism are volatile,''  Adolfo Aguilar Zinser wrote in a column in the newspaper Reforma. ''If they do not turn into concrete efforts, they turn bitter and dissipate.</p>
        <p>''For us to accomplish our goals,'' he added, ''it will be necessary to transform our political culture, to respect plurality and to build, among ourselves, bridges and more bridges.''</p>
