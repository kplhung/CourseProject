        <p>THE owners of a six-bedroom, three-bath split-level in Jericho on which Barbara Goldberg, a broker with the Prudential Long Island Realty agency in Syosset held an open house a week ago, had one stipulation when they listed it with her for $729,000: a prospective buyer had to agree that the closing would take place only after the sellers themselves had found another home to buy.</p>
        <p>''These are people who want to downsize, but they also have to find the house they want,'' said Mrs. Goldberg, adding that 19 prospects attended the open house, three of whom seemed ''very interested.''</p>
        <p>''If a buyer can't wait, the deal could fall apart,'' she said, ''but I have 27 years of experience in real estate sales and I will make a great effort to find these sellers the right house.''</p>
        <p>Similar contingency clauses have become routine in a market where there are still many more buyers than sellers. Bidding wars, with buyers competing against each other and offering more than the asking price, have also been common.</p>
        <p>However, indications now are that higher interest rates and a throttling back of the stock market are finally having some ripple effects on the local housing market. The number of listings is on the increase over all and although there are still plenty of buyers, brokers say they are not so quick to make an offer as earlier in the year. Listing prices, however, show no signs of coming down.</p>
        <p>According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which has about 1,000 member offices in Nassau and Suffolk, the number of houses on the market in Nassau increased to 3,468 in May from 2,782 in January, and in Suffolk to 5,378 from 4,644.  In January, the median contract price of a house in Nassau was $234,000 and in May it was $254,500, rising from $225,000 a year earlier. In Suffolk, the January figure was $173,000 and in May it was $180,000. A year earlier, it was $167,000.</p>
        <p>''What's happening in the market currently is that the listing inventory is picking up tremendously and buyers are slimming down, and we are starting to enter a transition period between a seller's and a buyer's market,'' said Fern Karhu, the manager at Prudential's Syosset office, which covers Syosset, Woodbury, Jericho and other areas of Nassau's North Shore. Her office took in 14 listings in June 1999, she said, while last month, it took in 27.</p>
        <p>''In January, February, March of this year,'' she went on to say, ''it was almost like a fire sale. People were paying top dollar, going over list price and making fast decisions. but now they are getting more skeptical.''</p>
        <p>Elaine Nolan, a broker with offices in Hempstead, said she was also seeing a noticeable slowdown in the pace of sales.  ''Listing prices aren't coming down, but it's been very quiet,'' she said. ''I used to get action on a house in two weeks, and now it takes me one to two months because buyers are more confident that they can find exactly what they are looking for.''</p>
        <p>Jan Kalman, a Woodmere broker. said: ''I wouldn't call this a hot market anymore.  Sellers still want high prices, but I now have 30 office exclusives instead of the 20 I had in May because the houses haven't sold.''</p>
        <p>Pat Levitt, a vice president of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island and a co-owner with her husband, Mac, of Century 21 Mac Levitt, which has offices in Oceanside, Freeport and Baldwin, attributes the rising number of listings to sellers who feel they want to take advantage of the high prices friends and neighbors are getting. ''Many people have decided the market is so good that now is the time to sell their homes,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And that may be one of the reasons behind changing market conditions, according to Jay Helsinger, owner of Custom South Shore Real Estate in Merrick. ''There is just so much a sponge can hold,'' he said. ''We've reached the maximum level and now people want max plus, and it's not going to be because as you reach the top, fewer and fewer people will be willing to pay top dollar.''</p>
        <p>Still, according to Joseph E. Mottola, the chief executive of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, the market is entering a much healthier phase than the one it has been in. ''The frenzy is missing,'' he said. ''The buyers are out there in strength, but homes are staying on the market a little longer and they are not always meeting the listing price. The snap sale is happening much less frequently.''</p>
        <p>THIS is a positive trend, Mr. Mottola said, ''because it creates more balance in the marketplace.'' He added: ''There are people who want to move up, but they are not going to put their house on the market until they find something, so everything is clogged in the pipeline. As the market slows down a little and more inventory comes in, it will be good for buyers and it will be good for sellers because it makes buying possible for more people.''</p>
        <p>While some brokers say that the market is cooling a bit, individual buyers will not necessarily find their own experience reflective of that perception. When Derek and Debbie Schoenhofen went to an open house in New Hyde Park last month, they found a bidding war that pushed offers past the $275,000 asking price.</p>
        <p>''The broker got 15 offers and the house, which needed at least $60,000 worth of work,  went for $15,000 more than its asking price,'' said Mr. Schoenhofen, an analyst for an investment firm in Manhattan. His wife is an accountant for a real estate agency. ''We called the day after the open house, but it was already gone,'' Mr. Schoenhofen added.</p>
        <p>The couple, who have been renting an apartment in Mineola, saw another house, this one in Williston Park, with a $259,000 asking price. They quickly made a $235,000 offer, which the owner has accepted.</p>
        <p>This house also needs a lot of work, but Mr. Schoenhofen was able to offer the amount he did because he intends to do much of it himself, he said.</p>
        <p>''In a nutshell, what buyers are facing is a great deal of competition, and you can't wait a couple of months to make a decision,'' he said. ''You have to tell the person tomorrow if you want the house or not, because it will be gone next week.''</p>
        <p>Evelyn Atanas, the owner of Atanas Realty in Williston Park, who showed the Schoenhofens their house, said that although she was taking more listings -- which, she said, would make it a little easier for buyers -- many potential sellers were still holding off because of fears that they, in turn, would not be able to find a house that suited them.</p>
        <p>''People realize they can get good prices, but unless they plan to move away, where are they going to go?'' she said.</p>
        <p>In that respect, Alison and Robert Gregory are fortunate. They do not have to worry about finding another house on Long Island because they are moving to Fort Meyers, Fla. Mr. Gregory has retired from his mechanic's job and one of their two children is going off to college, so they put their three-bedroom colonial in Williston Park on the market. ''We felt we couldn't afford to retire on Long Island, and so we decided, 'Let's get out now,' '' Mrs. Gregory said.</p>
        <p>They tried unsuccessfully to sell the home on their own, but after listing it with Ms. Atanas the house was in contract within two days. The Gregorys accepted $302,000, which was $8,000 below their asking price, ''but we did well,'' Mrs. Gregory said.</p>
        <p>Other sellers find themselves in a quandary, especially if an offer comes quickly.  Camille Pisciotto, owner of Great Neck Realty, Better Homes and Gardens, said she had been running up against the phenomenon of sellers pulling out of a deal even though a buyer was willing to meet their price because they could not find the right house to buy. ''I have three sellers in my office right now who changed their minds,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It used to be considered prudent to sell and then find another house,'' said Wayne McCann, owner of the Harmonious Homes agency in Sea Cliff. ''It's still the prudent thing to do, but a lot of sellers are pulling back when they find a buyer. Timing is one of the most frustrating and tension-causing aspects of buying and selling right now.''</p>
        <p>Katy Anastasio, a Huntington real estate broker, said that she still lacked houses to show. ''There is still more demand than supply and the majority of my listings sell in one to two weeks, although there do appear to be fewer lookers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A four-bedroom house priced at $500,000 in Fort Salonga on which she held an open house in March had 35 people looking and found a buyer in 20 minutes. An almost identical house in the same area, also priced at $500,000, had only 25 people show up for an open house held last month, but it found a buyer the same day. ''I didn't get 35, but all I need is one buyer,'' Ms. Anastasio said.</p>
        <p>''This is still not a situation where houses are coming on the market and not getting sold right away,'' said Dorothy Waxman, the manager of the Century 21 Laffey-Sandsport agency in Port Washington. ''Because of the location, the good schools and the transportation, Port Washington is the last to suffer when there is a downturn in the market,'' she said. ''I have so many buyers who will jump on something decent when it gets listed and we still don't have enough houses to meet the pent-up demand that exists.''</p>
        <p>Caution, rather than slowdown, is perhaps the best way to describe today's market, said Stuart Epstein, owner of Devlin McNiff Real Estate in East Hampton.</p>
        <p>With prices up 15 percent to 20 percent in the last 12 months, ''buyers are saying, 'I no longer will pay what's being asked of us;  let's take time out and make sure this is economically justifiable,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>The downturn in the stock market ''has made people reflect about the entire economic picture,'' he went on to say, adding:  ''It reminds them that what goes up can also come down. No one wants to be the last man in the bubble and buy property at the highest price.''</p>
        <p>But all this still must be taken in the context of a market that is still very robust, he added. ''The intrinsics here are still very powerful. The market is still great.''</p>
