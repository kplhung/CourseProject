        <p>ON a recent evening at the Surflight Theater in Beach Haven Steve McCoy was about to make his entrance in the musical ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' when a bug flew down his throat.</p>
        <p>''For my whole first scene I coughed and coughed and couldn't speak,'' Mr. McCoy said. ''I could actually feel the little legs in the back of my throat and everyone thought, 'Oh my God! What's wrong with him?' ''</p>

        <p>ON a recent evening at the Surflight Theater in Beach Haven Steve McCoy was about to make his entrance in the musical ''Meet Me in St. Louis'' when a bug flew down his throat.</p>
        <p>''For my whole first scene I coughed and coughed and couldn't speak,'' Mr. McCoy said. ''I could actually feel the little legs in the back of my throat and everyone thought, 'Oh my God! What's wrong with him?' ''</p>
        <p>That is just one of the many perils of summer theater. Even more troubling are the financial risks. Most summer stock theaters around the country have had to close. But the Surflight, New Jersey's last summer stock theater, now in its 51st season, sails on with its sprightly crew of Equity and other professional actors, talented young directors, set and costume designers, musicians, interns, apprentices and executive officers who keep the 450-seat theater afloat.</p>
        <p>This season the Surflight has taken on ''Titantic,'' becoming one of the first theaters to produce the show since it closed on Broadway. Scott Schwartz, who will be co-directing his first Broadway show next season, ''Jane Eyre,'' agreed to direct ''Titanic'' at the Surflight.</p>
        <p>''I thought that's crazy,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''It was a crazed idea to try to do this massive show in two weeks at the Surflight that on Broadway had a huge cast, huge technical demands and problems. A cast of 41 is big even for Broadway. But the idea appealed to me.'' The show opened last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Taking chances is nothing new at the Surflight. The theater was started in 1950 by Joseph P. Hayes, a performer of boundless energy, with profits he made from a small investment in ''Kiss Me Kate'' in 1948. People say Joe Hayes always made sure everyone got a seat, even if it was in the patio, and that he was always pushing Pepsi-Cola. The actress Joan Crawford, a member of the Pepsi board, heard about it and sent him an autographed photo that still hangs in the theater.</p>
        <p>First the Surflight was in a tent, but the tent kept blowing into the bay. Then it was next to a bowling alley, but the pins drowned out the actors. In 1953, it was moved to an old garage, where the theater has stayed put for 35 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hayes died in 1976. His friend and business partner, T. Scott Henderson, a local banker, took over as producer. He had helped Mr. Hayes start the theater's Show Place Ice Cream Parlour, with its singing waiters, theatrically named ice-cream concoctions and receipts that have helped the theater break even. Mr. Henderson went on to extend the season and to start the Joseph P. Hayes Foundation to support the theater's interns. In 1987 he converted the landmark building next door into a theater and moved out of the garage.</p>
        <p>In 1997, Mr. Henderson hired Steve Steiner, a Broadway actor, as the company's artistic director and Mr. Steiner's wife, Gail, as production manager. Last year, the Surflight received its first Equity contract. Now, Equity actors work side by side with student interns, volunteer apprentices and local residents. Close proximity to New York and the promise of artistic freedom has drawn many rising directors, choreographers and set designers to the theater. Ticket sales have been going up steadily, though each season is a struggle to make ends meet. But the Surflight Theater is propelled by dreams.</p>
        <p>''Steve is passionate about the theater, and Scott saved it single-handedly'' said James Brennan, an actor and director. He started his career in 1966 as an apprentice at the Surflight. ''It's very important when you are just starting out to have somebody there who feels that passionately,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''When we were at Surflight we had Joe Hayes, He just gave everybody that deep-rooted appreciation of theater that really propelled us through life.''</p>
        <p>While vacationers cavort at the beach, Surflighters labor with love from 9:30 a.m. until late at night, rehearsing and performing a new play every two weeks and a new children's play every week. Last week ''Titanic'' opened. The play before that was ''Meet Me in St. Louis.'' Coming up will be ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat,'' ''The Sound of Music,'' ''West Side Story,'' ''Victor/Victoria,'' ''Babes in Arms'' and ''Present Laughter.'' While Mr. Henderson wanted to produce the crowd-pleasing, ''Grease'' for a third season, Mr. Steiner wanted to try something that might be new to Surflight audiences, like Noel Coward.</p>
        <p>Both men agree that the Surflight Theater should become nonprofit. ''It's very difficult for theater to survive anymore as a profit-making situation and nonprofit has so many advantages,'' he said. ''In our particular case the reason we survive is the ice cream parlor.''</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon, Mr. Henderson was making sure the Show Place ice cream order had arrived; his wife, Jane, was in the box office; Mr. Steiner was with the piano tuner; Gail Steiner was on the phone discussing a coming production and blowing up balloons for the ''Meet Me in Saint Louis'' finale. Rob Wolin, who designed the ''Titantic'' set, was designing a villa for the Von Trapps; Nicole Zachowski, an intern from Turnersville, was on stage rehearsing her role as Kate Mullins in ''Titanic.'' The children's theater music director, David Milnes, was getting ready for ''Peter Pan'' after helping with the ''Titanic'' rehearsal. ''It's work but when you're doing something that makes kids laugh you love it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kneeland Whiting, a retired Beach Haven resident, had also been rehearsing his role as a wealthy businessman aboard the Titanic. Mr. Whiting's grandfather, Samuel Ward Stanton, a marine artist, lost his life on the ship. The Titanic is many things to many people. For the Surflight Theater it is another chance to make dreams come true.</p>
