        <p>New York Yankees shaky pitching staff has stabilized in series against New York Mets (M)</p>

        <p>Manager Joe Torre went to the mound to summon relievers six times on Thursday night, the eve of the series with the Mets. The Yankees' pitching staff was in jeopardy of crumbling, but instead of falling apart against the Mets, it has stabilized.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez pitched eight innings on Friday night, providing rest for most of the bullpen; Dwight Gooden threw five solid innings in a the first game of yesterday's day-night doubleheader; and Roger Clemens was solid for seven and a third innings in the nightcap. The Yankees won all three games.</p>
        <p>''It makes such a big difference when your pitching comes around,'' said Andy Pettitte, who is scheduled to start the fourth and final game of the series today.</p>
        <p>Ed Yarnall lasted only two batters into the second inning on Thursday, and the Yankees used six relievers in the 13-9 victory against Baltimore. Among them were Mike Stanton, who threw three and two-thirds innings; Jason Grimsley, who threw for the second consecutive day; Jeff Nelson, who pitched in the eighth; and Mariano Rivera, who pitched the ninth.</p>
        <p>Hernandez required only 103 pitches to throw eight innings Friday, and only Rivera was needed, to pitch the ninth inning for his 19th save. Nelson, Grimsley and Stanton were rested for their stints yesterday, and were effective.</p>
        <p>Torre said Gooden would probably pitch one of the Yankees' first five games after the All-Star Game break. Hernandez is expected to pitch the Yankees' first game after the break, on July 13, and Clemens, Pettitte, David Cone and, presumably, Gooden will follow.</p>
        <p>To make room for Gooden on their 25-man roster, the Yankees sent the right-hander Ben Ford to Class AAA Columbus.</p>
