        <p>''IT was the right thing to do,'' said the concerned hostess at the new Georgica Grill in East Hampton. We had requested a doggie bag for our leftover pasta; instead it had inadvertently been thrown out. ''It happens,'' we said. ''Forget it.'' But she insisted on giving us a freshly made portion of the outstanding fettuccine with shrimp and broccoli.</p>
        <p>That isn't the only ''right thing'' being done at this hospitable spot at 47 Montauk Highway (631-329-9821), just west of the village. In an area where $50 to $100 dinners have become the norm, the Georgica Grill consistently serves tasty, substantial meals for two to four patrons in that same price range. Solid, straightforward choices abound, only 2 of 14 entrees exceed $18, pastas cost as little as $10, there's a three-course $20 fixed-price weekend menu and wine starts at $4 a glass and $11 a bottle.</p>

        <p>''IT was the right thing to do,'' said the concerned hostess at the new Georgica Grill in East Hampton. We had requested a doggie bag for our leftover pasta; instead it had inadvertently been thrown out. ''It happens,'' we said. ''Forget it.'' But she insisted on giving us a freshly made portion of the outstanding fettuccine with shrimp and broccoli.</p>
        <p>That isn't the only ''right thing'' being done at this hospitable spot at 47 Montauk Highway (631-329-9821), just west of the village. In an area where $50 to $100 dinners have become the norm, the Georgica Grill consistently serves tasty, substantial meals for two to four patrons in that same price range. Solid, straightforward choices abound, only 2 of 14 entrees exceed $18, pastas cost as little as $10, there's a three-course $20 fixed-price weekend menu and wine starts at $4 a glass and $11 a bottle.</p>
        <p>Michael Cinanni, the Culinary Institute of America-trained chef and co-owner (his wife is the hostess), along with Dan Erwin, his Johnson and Wales-schooled chef de cuisine, are turning out well-prepared, up-to-the minute, international selections:  quesadillas, pastas and pizzas as well as Asian, Southwestern and barbecue dishes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cinanni, who worked at such  Hamptons' hot spots as 75 Main in Southampton, and his partner, Jed Schutz, have brightened the stand-alone restaurant, which previously housed Zizzi Balooba. The prominent, colorful ceramic tile columns remain, as does the undulating coopper-topped bar, but the walls and floor have been lightened and the work of local artists is now displayed on those walls. (A planting or display outside the large picture would be a good idea as would more fabric to absorb sound at this low-ceilinged, hard-surfaced, noisy-when-full spot.)</p>
        <p>It also should be noted that, with few exceptions, the staff here has accomplished something that continues to evade servers at many of those $50 to $100 a person palaces.  They always seem to know who ordered what, even when the person who delivers the food isn't the one who took the order.</p>
        <p>Georgica Grill is not for diners who want to impress others with the prestige, glamour and cachet of their favorite restaurants. Rather, it is an eatery for both hometowners and tourists seeking value and flavor.  Two starters to satisfy a table of four are typical: an eight-piece pizza-size dish of duck quesadillas ($8) and the house pizza ($10). The quesadillas are filled with plenty of tender, juicy, minced duck, ancho chili, melted Monterey jack and cheddar cheeses that are topped with jalapeno rounds and specks of scallions and red, yellow and green peppers. The pizza is the ''ultra thin'' crusted variety that the menu promises (it benefits from a shake or two of salt). A top pick is a dish of four grilled jumbo shrimp ($9), with a garlicky marinade-glaze sprinkled with a tomato and corn confetti, presented on a bed of greens and accompanied by cilantro aioli. Also notable is the portobello cap ($8) with melted feta cheese enriching its spinach and crab crown.</p>
        <p>A too-cold terrine of grilled vegetables and goat cheese ($7) yielded but faint flavors and a Caesar salad ($7) was routine, but a big bowl of beef barley soup of the day ($4), while not heavy or thick, made a homey mellow impression.</p>
        <p>Meticulously cooked, moist salmon, with a delicate potato and Dijon crust ($18) resting on seasoned, sauteed spinach, was a winner, as was the lively, tasty shrimp, broccoli, sun-dried tomato, garlic and oil fettuccine ($15) with a remarkable number of tiny shrimp. Even lighter is the non-traditional spin given to feathery Singapore noodles ($17) laced with julienne vegetables, shrimp, chicken chunks and a squirt of chili oil in a ginger broth. Purists who expect the noodles to be lightly bathed in curry and the ingredients (including pork) to be minced or finely cubed might be disappointed with this version.</p>
        <p>Eleven golden-crusted, medium-size sea scallops ($18), encircling julienne vegetables in a subtle orange-ginger sauce, are rewarding, as was the thin-sliced, medium-rare, boneless loin of lamb on a bed of tangy tarragon-mint sauce and escorted by airy, though rich mashed potatoes and gently cooked crisp green beans and carrots. Those same plate-mates also came with another less noteworthy entree from the price-fixed menu. Billed as boneless pousson, with caramelized applies, it was an ordinary whole baby chicken with bones and sauteed apples.</p>
        <p>The sliced, grilled, steak sandwich, presented medium rare on a large soft roll containing caramelized onions and melted Monterey cheese with tomato, onion and a mound of fries, is a better bet.</p>
        <p>Best bets at meal's end include a small, but potent, flourless chocolate indulgence care ($5) that's gooey, fudgey and presented with whipped cream and raspberry coulis; creme brulee ($4) boasting rich custard and a crisp, sugary surface; an exemplary chocolate mousse ($4), with just a hint of amaretto; and a lighter-than-air Key lime pie ($5) that will appeal to patrons who enjoy lemon chiffon and lemon mousse more than lovers of the tangy conventional type.</p>
