        <p>The Slice Menace</p>
        <p>Q.: Pizzerias generally display their cooked pies on the counter for as long as it takes to sell them, reheating the pizza one slice at a time until it finally disappears and a fresh one takes its place. Is this healthy?</p>
        <p>A.: ''This is the most common health violation among pizza restaurants,'' said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the Health Department. ''Pizza should be kept at 140 degrees, and before it is re-served it should be reheated to 165 degrees. It should not be sitting out on a counter for more than two hours.''</p>

        <p>The Slice Menace</p>
        <p>Q.: Pizzerias generally display their cooked pies on the counter for as long as it takes to sell them, reheating the pizza one slice at a time until it finally disappears and a fresh one takes its place. Is this healthy?</p>
        <p>A.: ''This is the most common health violation among pizza restaurants,'' said Sandra Mullin, a spokeswoman for the Health Department. ''Pizza should be kept at 140 degrees, and before it is re-served it should be reheated to 165 degrees. It should not be sitting out on a counter for more than two hours.''</p>
        <p>After two hours, bacterial contamination of meats and cheeses is possible, Ms. Mullin said, and consumption of a tainted slice could result in intestinal illnesses, stomach flu and diarrhea, though these afflictions would probably last no more than 24 hours.</p>
        <p>What about the dusty pies sitting in those middle-of-nowhere, open-all-night pizza joints out where the buses don't run? ''If it sits for over two hours, it should be thrown out,'' Ms. Mullin said. ''Pizzeria operators know the requirements, and they have all taken the food protection safety course. They know that when we do an inspection, we come in with thermometers and check the actual temperature.'' Summer should not present any additional health issues, Ms. Mullin said, but if windows and screens are up or doors are left open, flies can bring contamination into the restaurant. Bon appetit!</p>
        <p>Courthouse Security</p>
        <p>Q.: Recently my daughter was taking photos of the downtown courthouses for a school project. When she tried to photograph the United States Court House at 40 Centre Street, however, a United States marshal told her photographs of the building are forbidden. Is it actually illegal?</p>
        <p>A.: No. But since the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, security guards and law enforcement officers at Federal buildings in New York  have been required to prevent the building's security arrangements and equipment from being photographed, according to Renee Miscione, a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration. Since security measures are concentrated at the building's entrances and exits, guards can apply the restriction to just about anyone.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes they will just approach someone when they see a camera,'' Ms. Miscione said. ''We know these are public buildings, but it's a balancing act.''</p>
        <p>The restrictions apply to both the interior and exterior of Federal buildings, and include film and videotape as well as still photographs, Ms. Miscione said. Apart from post office buildings and parking garages, the Federal Government owns, operates and manages 13 office buildings and courthouses in the city. These include, in addition to the United States Court House, offices at 26 Federal Plaza and 290 Broadway, and the Custom House at 1 Bowling Green.</p>
        <p>John A. Schmaltz, assistant chief of United States marshals for the Southern District of New York, said marshals at the United States Court House have been on high alert since the two trials, in 1994 and 1997, of the conspirators in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The trial of six men for the 1998 bombings of two United States Embassies in East Africa, to begin next year, is cause for further concern, he said.</p>
        <p>Wings Over Manhattan</p>
        <p>Q.: When was the first airplane flight over Manhattan?</p>
        <p>A.: On Oct. 4, 1909, when Wilbur Wright flew from Governors Island up the Hudson to Grants Tomb and back, in an airplane outfitted with a red canoe for emergency water landings. The flight took 33 minutes.</p>
