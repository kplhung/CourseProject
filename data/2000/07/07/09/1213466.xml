        <p>It has been 10 months since Governor Whitman dropped out of the Senate race. But watching her in action these days, it is hard to escape the feeling that she's still running for something.</p>
        <p>So far this year she has gone on trade missions to Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and Korea -- the kind of high-profile jaunts elected officials often take to appear statesmanlike and position themselves for political appointment.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mrs. Whitman has appeared as a guest on several nationally televised programs: including ABC's ''This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts'' and MSNBC's political program ''Hardball'' with Chris Matthews. (Mr. Matthews fawns over Mrs. Whitman so much that her appearances would be more aptly entitled ''Warm and Fuzzy Softball.'')</p>
        <p>Some of the governor's staff members have been quietly pointing out what a valuable asset Mrs. Whitman might be to the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, George W. Bush -- either as a vice presidential running mate or, should he win the White House, as a high-ranking member of his administration.</p>
        <p>The governor has publicly tried to douse any speculation about a vice presidential run, saying that her support of abortion rights makes it unlikely that the right wing of the Republican Party would tolerate her on the ticket. And her communications director, Pete McDonough, insists that Governor Whitman's eyes are focused solely on issues within the state's borders.</p>
        <p>''Right now, it's all just an idle parlor game played by people who don't know anything,'' Mr. McDonough said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But with Mr. Bush leading in the polls and the Republican Convention later this month in Philadelphia, just an hour from the governor's day job, Mrs. Whitman's name is being uttered in a lot of parlors. And most of the people talking about a George W. administration as if it were a rotisserie baseball league know that the realities of New Jersey politics mean that Mrs. Whitman's biggest accomplishments as governor are almost certainly behind her.</p>
        <p>Given Mrs. Whitman's performance in office, most of the speculation centers on several cabinet posts.</p>
        <p>For instance, she is credited with improving the state's business climate, and might make a logical choice to head the Commerce Department. The governor's environmental record may be a matter of debate among some New Jerseyans, but it is stronger than that of most of her Republican peers, so the Environmental Protection Agency would be a possibility. And as an outdoors enthusiast who won financing for her open space preservation plan, Mrs. Whitman's resume might also qualify her for the Department of Interior, which oversees the nation's parks and land-management policy.</p>
        <p>But among New Jersey's power players -- Republican fund-raisers and donors -- word is that Mrs. Whitman's real goal is a diplomatic post. After nearly seven years in the nation's most powerful governor's office, many money people among the state's Republicans say she is interested in the less grueling schedule of an ambassador.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman once lived in England, and is fluent in the native tongue. She also studied in France, and while it is unclear whether she is a fan of Jerry Lewis movies, Mrs. Whitman has a proven record as an irrepressible Alpine skier.</p>
        <p>''An ambassadorship would allow her to stay involved in policy,'' said one fund-raiser, who asked not to be identified, ''but without being under the day-to-day microscope of a cabinet official.''</p>
        <p>Inside the State House these days, there is a vaguely valedictory air. After signing the state budget a week ago, Mrs. Whitman was asked to list her priorities for the next six months. The governor hesitated, mentioned how gratified she was that the Legislature approved virtually all of her initiatives, and said she did not really have any other major plans.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the reason the administration got so much of what it wanted was because its goals were not particularly ambitious. With New Jersey raking in high tax receipts and a windfall from a settlement with tobacco companies, a first-term governor might have seized the moment to tackle some of the state's more intractable issues: overhauling the property tax system by encouraging regionalization; a more ambitious program to help troubled inner cities or combat suburban sprawl; a H.M.O. regulation reform.</p>
        <p>A fiscal conservative -- like, say, Bill Clinton -- might have even used the surplus to pay down the state's mounting debt.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Whitman chose a path with far less resistance: a few minor tax cuts, a plan to help low-income families afford health insurance, more aid to municipalities and open space. The state also agreed to borrow billions to renovate schools and repair roads and bridges. Not bad for someone entering the lame duck phase of her tenure, but hardly the stuff of which political reputations are made.</p>
        <p>With the two Republican leaders of the Legislature jousting to succeed Mrs. Whitman as governor, her remaining 18 months in office are likely to offer even fewer opportunities for bold action. So could anyone blame Mrs. Whitman if her thoughts wandered to Washington?</p>
        <p>''I just asked her about all the speculation and she said she just wants to be the best governor she can be,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''If George Bush were to offer something, she'd give it consideration. But she doesn't have her sights set on anything.''</p>
        <p>Sounds like a diplomat already.</p>
