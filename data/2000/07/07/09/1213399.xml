        <p>Donald Baechler  Glenn Horowitz Bookseller, 87 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To July 19. (631) 324-5511.</p>
        <p>Donald Baechler's assertive paintings, which make the commonplace seem special, have been receiving international attention since the early 80's. Rendered as flat, cartoonlike depictions, images might be heads in a crowd, a simplified house, or, in the case of this new group of canvases, flowers that seem borrowed from fabric patterns.</p>
        <p>In each instance, the floral image is boldly presented against a canvas collaged with frayed patches and marked with evidence of life's ordinariness, especially accidents like coffee spills, drips and the circular stains left by a cup. Applied with a subtle elegance, this treatment has the effect of elevating the casual and informal. A gentle irony seems present, too, in the way traditionally disregarded experiences are offered for reconsideration.</p>
        <p>In addition to recalling the repeats in textile designs, ''Uniform and the Occupation'' and several other simplified flower examples suggest the schematized language of scientific symbols.</p>
        <p>Cartoonlike characteristics can make a work appear very accessible and light. There is considerable opportunity here, however, to speculate about broader meanings, like the anti-traditionalism implied by surface ripples and irregularities; the deprivation suggested by unraveling cloth patches, and, in ''That Same Damn Flower,'' the beauty built over a background imbedded with a discarded undergarment.</p>
        <p>The paintings appear to address the processing of leftover experiences and thoughts, even the obsessiveness involved with recollections of a printed pattern.</p>
        <p>'American Impressionism'</p>
        <p>Guild Hall Museum, 158 Main Street, East Hampton. To July 30. (631) 324-0806.</p>
        <p>During the next two years, a group of 52 paintings from the Smithsonian American Art Museum will be touring the country. Guild Hall is the first of the five stops for this collection, which has a much broader date range, the 1860's through the 1920's, than its title infers.</p>
        <p>Painted in 1866, Whistler's veiled, atmospheric view of Valparaiso Harbor is included to point to his role as a precursor for later misty canvases like those by Homer Dodge Martin and Dwight Tryon hanging nearby.  In another gallery, an 1873 portrait of a Spanish dancer by Mary Cassatt reveals the dark shadow tones that she and other American artists would soon abandon after exposure to French Impressionism.</p>
        <p>Vibrant, shimmering canvases by Willard Metcalf and Theodore Robinson represent the dedicated American artists who participated in the art colony at Giverny, Monet's village in France. Working with a pure, prismatic palette and applying color in small, individual strokes that could retain and convey characteristics of colored light, the American Impressionists absorbed and interpreted the new ideas and laid the foundation for many subsequent stylistic explorations in this country.  Childe Hassam's very successful coastal New England view, ''Celia Thaxter in Her Garden,'' captures the optical qualities of a sun-drenched scene and has an all-over tonality that looks quite modern.</p>
        <p>There are frequent reminders of the way the Smithsonian's selections stretch to allow consideration of a number of different directions, which were regarded as innovative at various points during the exhibition's broad time period. Impressionism's direct observation of nature is here, but so, too, are several works featuring allegorical and mythological themes. The casual, slice-of-life compositions typical of Impressionism's swift recordings of color and light at a given moment dominate the galleries, but several tautly constructed pieces also stand out.</p>
        <p>While the expected examples of  artists' responding to the spirit and mood of their local settings are in ample supply, there are some outstanding works that refer to this country's fondness for things Asian.  Hassam's ''Tanagra,'' depicting a contemplative woman in a Manhattan room decorated in a Japanese motif, is particularly memorable.</p>
        <p>A tendency towards softness unifies all aspects of the exhibition. Atmospheric studies fit nicely into the theme, and here too, the variety of offerings reveal different motivations, ranging from the scientific examination of weather phenomena to attempts to evoke the mesmerizing qualities of reverie.</p>
        <p>'Asian Identities'  Hofstra Museum, Hofstra University, Hempstead. To Aug. 3. (516) 463-5672.</p>
        <p>Using modern variations on traditional Oriental calligraphy as a common denominator, ''Asian Identities: East and West'' examines recent work by eight artists whose abstract paintings explore new applications of gestural lines.  Some of the artists have an Asian heritage, and some do not. Selections were made by a private group that organizes touring exhibitions.</p>
        <p>The show tackles a big idea, but, unfortunately, it is developed in a small and unsatisfying way. One problem is the inclusion of work that merges thick, weighty texture with calligraphy, a step that cancels the expressive potential of both.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, a good proportion of the artists warrant attention. Heung Mo Kim's mural-scaled ''Soulscape'' is a memorable apocalyptic painting that blends structural forms with churning elements to make a convincing metaphor for worldly chaos.  A quiet, pale piece by Barbara Bartholomew is impressive, too, for the way it builds on the concept of sequence, developing each unit as an evocative field offering variations of gentle, muted nuances.</p>
        <p>Joe Haroutuian's tighter approach creates energetic, interlocking schemes from dry-brushed color to produce powerful paintings that have a mesmerizing intricacy.  Many of Chi Watts's canvases are notable, too, for the way they enlarge brushstrokes, emphasizing their diagonal sweep and giving them a signlike assertiveness.</p>
        <p>With complex dark markings that can take on the appearance of vines, lacy twigs or swiftly moving amoebalike shapes, Hisako Kobayashi's work comes closest to suggesting aspects of nature.  The main thrust, however, comes from the way separate surface sections are given an intense luminosity, often with an added silvery coating.</p>
