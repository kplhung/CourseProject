      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>ELECTRONIC music: such a good idea, and such a mess. And such an ideal opportunity for the world of postwar composition, dominated, as it was, by theorists: you could talk all you wanted about this stuff because the technology for realizing it was years away.</p>
        <p>These are thoughts occasioned by trawling through the recent three-disc collection ''Ohm'' (Ellipsis Arts CD 3670), mysteriously subtitled ''The Early Gurus of Electronic Music,'' and covering the years 1948 to 1980 (although to be precise, two pieces predate those years). I don't know about gurus, but the whole crowd is here for all to hear: Cage, Luening, Varese, Dockstader, Stockhausen, Oliveros, Subotnick, Riley, Xenakis, Young, Parmegiani, Lucier and Eno, just to name a few. There are a couple of omissions (full disclosure: I am thanked in the liner notes because I brought the producers together with Tangerine Dream, the German electronic rock group from the 1970's, which wound up denying them permission to use a track), but overall, this is a fine presentation.</p>

        <p>ELECTRONIC music: such a good idea, and such a mess. And such an ideal opportunity for the world of postwar composition, dominated, as it was, by theorists: you could talk all you wanted about this stuff because the technology for realizing it was years away.</p>
        <p>These are thoughts occasioned by trawling through the recent three-disc collection ''Ohm'' (Ellipsis Arts CD 3670), mysteriously subtitled ''The Early Gurus of Electronic Music,'' and covering the years 1948 to 1980 (although to be precise, two pieces predate those years). I don't know about gurus, but the whole crowd is here for all to hear: Cage, Luening, Varese, Dockstader, Stockhausen, Oliveros, Subotnick, Riley, Xenakis, Young, Parmegiani, Lucier and Eno, just to name a few. There are a couple of omissions (full disclosure: I am thanked in the liner notes because I brought the producers together with Tangerine Dream, the German electronic rock group from the 1970's, which wound up denying them permission to use a track), but overall, this is a fine presentation.</p>
        <p>Listening to it, though, is another matter. Two technological developments determined the earliest attempts in this genre: tape recording, invented in Germany during the Second World War, and computing, which was in its infancy during the period covered here. Tape recording made the manipulation of sounds far easier: you could record at varied speeds, cut the tape and re-splice it in any way you wanted and play it forward or backward.</p>
        <p>Thus some of the earliest recordings here, like Pierre Schaeffer's ''Etude aux Chemins de Fer,'' which uses train sounds as its source material, or Hugh Le Caine's ''Dripsody,'' based on the sound of a water drop. But of course there were those who felt that ''real'' sounds were an impediment to the pure abstraction that the medium demanded, and these were the poor souls who had to coax sounds out of early signal-generators and try to sequence them using huge, slow, expensive computers.</p>
        <p>One of my earliest memories of electronic music, in fact, was a television show on which Otto Luening and Vladimir Ussachevsky, who ran the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center, appeared. Luening carefully explained how he was setting up what we were going to hear, twisting knobs and throwing switches as he talked, and finally, after all was ready, he said ''And now. . . .'' Nothing happened. Not as unusual an occurrence as you might think; just ask anyone whose work is represented in this collection. No matter which school you belonged to, assembling a composition could take months while you set up equipment, edited tapes and layered sounds in what was a primitive form of multitracking.</p>
        <p>If the early works here share a fault, it is one they share with most non-electronic composition of the time: over-abstraction. There were those who tried to apply Webern's theories to electronics, with results like Milton Babbitt's ''Philomel,'' in which a soprano, both taped and live, does her atonal best over similarly random-seeming electronic sounds. There were mystics like Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose pieces are often the end-product of meditation and theorizing.</p>
        <p>But there were always others alongside the electronic establishment: Oskar Sala, who invented a giant keyboard instrument called the Trautonium; Louis and Bebe Barron, Hollywood pioneers who did the soundtrack to ''Forbidden Planet,'' the first all-electronic film score; Raymond Scott, an eccentric inventor and composer who gave Robert Moog, the inventor of the synthesizer that bears his name, his first job. By putting their work before the public, usually through film or television, they helped keep this music from being the exclusive property of academics.</p>
        <p>The second half of the 1960's brought forth a new generation with access to improving technology and a sense of rebelliousness toward the pioneers. Divesting themselves of theory in favor of an attitude of just letting it happen, working with synthesizers made by Mr. Moog and Donald Buchla capable of performing live in real time, composers like Morton Subotnick and Terry Riley made breakthroughs with the public. It snapped up recordings of Mr. Subotnick's ''Silver Apples of the Moon'' and Mr. Riley's ''Rainbow in Curved Air.''</p>
        <p>Nor was ''serious'' composition the only place where the anything-goes philosophy was taking over. Holger Czukay, a student of Stockhausen, wound up in Can, a Cologne-based rock group, with very serious ideas about music.</p>
        <p>The reason the compilers stopped in 1980 was that around then the division between pop and non-pop got too blurred. By 1980, electronics were just another tool, a flavoring, epitomized by Brian Eno's role in the British band Roxy Music, in which he manipulated sounds electronically rather than simply being a ''keyboard player.'' Mr. Eno left the group in 1973 to stake out a musical turf between pop and non-pop, a realm he would share with an increasing number of others. In Detroit, young black men like Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson were experimenting with pure electronic dance music, while in Munich, Giorgio Moroder was making similar discoveries and applying them to Donna Summer's disco records. Synthesizers were now small and cheap enough that the early 1980's saw dozens of British and American bands using them, often with no other instrumentation.</p>
        <p>''Ohm'' shows how we got to a place in which anyone with a computer can be a composer, $200 will get you a keyboard instrument of greater sophistication than anything anyone was working with on these tracks and music without electronics is as exotic as music with it once was. Not everything is presented at full length, although enough is given so you can decide if you want to hear more.</p>
        <p>And it's not all pleasant listening -- the La Monte Young track can be painful, especially when listened to through headphones, since it's intended to be heard in a room in which the listener can move around. But especially with the more technically sophisticated compositions on Discs 2 and 3, it's like listening to field recordings of a future that came and went without our realizing it.</p>
