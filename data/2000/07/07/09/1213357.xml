        <p>To the Editor: Certainly the pros and cons of privatization of the British Rail network discussed in ''Service Slips, Fares Baffle on British Trains'' (Correspondent's Report, May 28) can be argued from political and economic standpoints. As someone involved before and after privatization, I too have my views. A few facts will show why overseas tourists in the hundreds of thousands use the British Rail network and why Britain's railways are in a period of strong growth:</p>
        <p>Passenger numbers are up 30 percent in four years, and are now at a billion journeys a year.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Certainly the pros and cons of privatization of the British Rail network discussed in ''Service Slips, Fares Baffle on British Trains'' (Correspondent's Report, May 28) can be argued from political and economic standpoints. As someone involved before and after privatization, I too have my views. A few facts will show why overseas tourists in the hundreds of thousands use the British Rail network and why Britain's railways are in a period of strong growth:</p>
        <p>Passenger numbers are up 30 percent in four years, and are now at a billion journeys a year.</p>
        <p>Ninety-two percent of trains were within 10 minutes of scheduled arrival time for long distance, and within five minutes for local trains.</p>
        <p>Seventy-six percent of the British market is satisfied with the rail journey, according to an April 2000 survey of 19,962 passengers.</p>
        <p>Many of the travel options mentioned by Alan Cowell in his article are not meant for overseas visitors. He also mentions the simple answer: the unrestricted, economical BritRail Pass.</p>
        <p>The variety of passes offered only to non-British residents simplifies travel planning. With a BritRail Pass you can book seats in advance or simply board the train and take a seat. The toll-free number in the United States is (877) 677-1066.</p>
