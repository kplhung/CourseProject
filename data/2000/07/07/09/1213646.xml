        <p>There's a right price for every stock, and Andy Borowitz of White Plains knows what it is: $35.</p>
        <p>Actually, if that was all that Mr. Borowitz knew, and was prepared to tell, there would be no need to buy his book ''The Trillionaire Next Door: The Greedy Investor's Guide to Day Trading,'' published last month by HarperBusiness.</p>

        <p>There's a right price for every stock, and Andy Borowitz of White Plains knows what it is: $35.</p>
        <p>Actually, if that was all that Mr. Borowitz knew, and was prepared to tell, there would be no need to buy his book ''The Trillionaire Next Door: The Greedy Investor's Guide to Day Trading,'' published last month by HarperBusiness.</p>
        <p>But -- tongue firmly wedged in cheek -- the writer shares his expertise in picking stocks and timing the market, as well as his thoughts on good nutrition for day traders. (Tic Tacs are essential. Fat is good, especially in the form of pizza.)</p>
        <p>The book also wrestles with a tough question: if Mr. Borowitz, who helped create the television series ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,'' actually made a trillion dollars as a day trader, why does he need to sell this book at $20 a pop? There is an answer.</p>
        <p>There is also, by the way, a Web site, www.sexytrillionaire.com.</p>
