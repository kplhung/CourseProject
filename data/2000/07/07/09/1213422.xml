        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter Applebome's gentle examination of his musical journey from Great Neck to Chappaqua by way of Ypsilanti and the South [''A Southern Throb in a Northern Heart,'' June 25], in which he contracted an inextinguishable taste for ''real'' country music along the way, struck a 12-string chord with me. My formative years in Tidewater Virginia listening to Hank Snow, Lefty Frizzell, Webb Pierce, Mel Tillis and Porter Wagoner prepared me not at all for my high school years in Fairfield County, Conn., where my incomprehensible musical tastes evoked wonder and even pity from my peers.</p>
        <p>However, when I moved to Phoenix after law school in New York, I fit right in again -- this time with George Jones, Ray Price, Buck Owens and the very early (and crew-cut) Waylon Jennings, whose Friday night gigs at Wild Bill's were don't-miss. And, of course, there was Johnny Cash, whose four-note range never dimmed his appeal, no matter how many songs he recorded with it.</p>

        <p>Peter Applebome's gentle examination of his musical journey from Great Neck to Chappaqua by way of Ypsilanti and the South [''A Southern Throb in a Northern Heart,'' June 25], in which he contracted an inextinguishable taste for ''real'' country music along the way, struck a 12-string chord with me.

        <p>Today, as Mr. Applebome's article shows, it's O.K. for an Easterner to come out of his country closet. If you live in my area (the Washington suburbs), for example, every Saturday afternoon you can join Eddie Stubbs's three-hour trip down some of country music's mossiest and most nostalgic byways on WAMU and never have to look over your shoulder to check who's watching you listen.</p>
