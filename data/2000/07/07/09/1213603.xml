        <p>FOR shoe seismologists, the fourth-floor women's shoe department at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is a prime place to detect early tremors.</p>
        <p>To please its demanding, moneyed clientele, Saks specializes in delivering the newest, comeliest creations from Spain and Italy before other retailers do. But while the department is nearly always chock-full of well-pedicured women, they are arguably not its most ardent clientele.</p>
        <p>The capacious salon is an important hunting ground for trend-spotters -- the stylists from mass-market shoe designers who need to know what will soon be the retail rage from Denver to Dubuque.</p>
        <p>And last February, Saks sent off powerful shock waves. The store's shelves were stocked with purple paisley-print wooden wedges, tiger-striped thongs in neon jungle greens and gold-mesh pumps with laminated gold heels. Imagine the types of shoes that Jerry Garcia might have designed in the throes of a Grateful Dead concert and you get the idea.</p>
        <p>Within months, shoes at other retailers and on feet everywhere were equally dazzling. The chunky black pump that had been the standby for everything from pants suits to summer minis was looking a little too chunky. Instead, cool mavens were wearing  gingham print open-toed pumps in the office, multicolored embroidered and beaded slides or suede moccasin-sneaker hybrids in the park and on the street, and python-print sandals with dizzying come-hither heels as soon as the sun went down.</p>
        <p>This sensory attack was not just the fashion indulgence of a few wayward designers; it was a coordinated industry assault from merchants like Bloomingdale's and design houses like Steve Madden and Via Spiga. Despite the overall boom in consumer spending, shoe sales have grown at a minuscule 1.8 percent a year for the last decade, according to Footwear Market Insights, an industry research organization based in Nashville. That is in keeping with historical growth going back to the 1940's, but disappointing in comparison with the 1980's, when, fueled by the athletic craze, shoe consumption jumped about 6 percent a year.</p>
        <p>So the footwear industry had to tackle a problem that now and then plagues consumer industries from clothes to cars: When cash registers stop ringing, how do you entice consumers to go out and buy more?</p>
        <p>The answer, in a word, was revolution, not evolution.</p>
        <p>Inspired by current psychedelic  clothing styles and able to exploit new technologies that easily allow  fancy embellishments like beading, shoemakers are dreaming up fantasy styles that have never been seen before. And they hope that their exotic new confections will re-ignite consumer interest with a passion.</p>
        <p>The changes affect women's fashion shoes at all price levels. Some children's shoes and even some men's footwear, usually very conservative, are getting an infusion of shade and attitude, too. (Even the staid Brooks Brothers is selling slide-on sneakers in nubuck for men with style acumen.)</p>
        <p>''The industry has been in a rut,'' sighed Fawn Evenson, president of the Footwear Industries of America, a trade group. ''All that you see out there is a desperate attempt to change that.''</p>
        <p>Going for a bit of brightness and whimsy sounds obvious enough -- even Apple Computer scored big when it thought to market its wares in shades brighter than beige -- but it also carries risk. Business history is replete with newfangled fashions and products that consumers refused to buy (remember the maxi-skirt?), and retailers and manufacturers alike must walk a fine line between attracting and alienating customers.</p>
        <p>For the shoe industry, the move is a surprisingly bold experiment. Over most of the last decade, women seemed to want to buy only one thing: black. Or, more specifically,  Ms. Evenson said, ''black-leather, square-toed, fat-heeled.''</p>
        <p>About 362 million pairs of women's dress and casual shoes were sold at retail last year, according to Footwear Market Insights, and roughly 85 percent of them were black or brown, according to Mike Kormos, the organization's president.</p>
        <p>Bill Boettge, president of the National Shoe Retailers Association, the trade group of the independent retailers, agreed. ''We got into a black key that was just incredible,'' Mr. Boettge said. ''The first five colors were black, black, black, black and black.''</p>
        <p>That preference struck fear into the hearts of manufacturers and retailers alike: The more that footwear became separated from the rest of fashion, the less likely that women would feel compelled to refill their shoe closets with any frequency.  ''You can't keep selling black dumb shoes, when women already have seven pairs in their closet,'' Ms. Evenson said.</p>
        <p>So now the bet is whether season-shifting colors and the latest decorations can bring out the average shopper's inner Imelda Marcos.</p>
        <p>The Fashion Connection</p>
        <p>Changing fashions, of course, got shoe designers into the color bind in the first place. For a long time, many American women obeyed the fashion dictum to coordinate the color of their shoes with that of their clothing. A turquoise sundress required turquoise slingbacks, and a red suit called for power red pumps.</p>
        <p>But sometime in the 1990's, the New York-centric affinity for black and neutral outfits became the uniform for women elsewhere. Some trace the trend to the rise of the designer Kenneth Cole, whose pared-back urbanite look has been a major influence for the last five years. Whatever the reason, black, once strictly for winter and evening wear, suddenly became ubiquitous. Even in the South, the signature, post-Memorial day white pumps went the way of hand-churned ice cream.</p>
        <p>But what sartorial caprice can take away, it can return as well. And lately the neutral-shade monopoly has been overthrown. Janet Moran, vice president and divisional merchandise manager for shoes at Saks, thinks she can place her finger on the  moment when things went wild. ''It goes back to the Gucci runway collection for the spring, 1999,'' she said. ''Tom Ford did the beaded jeans and Hawaiian prints. He did it at his level and then everyone followed.''</p>
        <p>By this year, ready-to-wear collections were ablaze in colors (magenta, mandarin, lime), patterns, embellishments (beads, feather, embroidery) and novelty materials (both real and faux python and crocodile).</p>
        <p>With their pent-up creative juices suddenly freed, the most influential shoe designers ferociously began offering their own interpretations of the season's biggest trends. There was color -- as in suede moccasins by J. P. Todd in a power-pastel rainbow of lilac, burnt orange and lemon frappe. There was decoration, as in Dolce &amp; Gabbana's romantic-as-a-spring-picnic-in-the-Tuscan-hills slides, in white satin, embroidered with strawberries on the vine. (The seeds and leaves on the strawberries are actually tiny black and green beads.) And there was novelty, most influentially represented by the understated round-toe 1940's-style dance pumps in ostrich by Prada.</p>
        <p>''Designers wanted to do something pretty and this year it was quite fun,'' said Stuart Weitzman, whose privately owned label is a department store mainstay.</p>
        <p>Department stores, which increasingly rely on shoes and accessories as a profit center, have followed the designers' leads and bet big on out-there offerings. Nordstrom, which specializes in carrying a particularly large shoe selection, estimates that it had three times more color on its sales floor this spring than a year ago.</p>
        <p>Technological Triumph</p>
        <p>Fashion is not the only influence on shoe offerings. Some of this year's most whimsical creations would not have been available in the mass market if not for new technologies.</p>
        <p>New techniques let shoemakers enamel heels in the same durable paints that carmakers like Mercedes-Benz use to coat their vehicles. Titanium fillers allow heels to be sculpted into the most improbable shapes and heights, while sustaining strength. One of Mr. Weitzman's popular evening designs has the foot-coddling portion of the shoe perched on a rhinestone-studded, pyramid heel that narrows to a tiny pinpoint beneath the foot.</p>
        <p>''It is like an optical illusion,'' he said. ''We definitely could not have made that five years ago.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, decorations like multithread embroidery had to be done mostly by skilled artisans, meaning that the process was impractical for shoes priced below $100.</p>
        <p>Now there are all sorts of automated machines that make these embellishments doable at $70 retail, not $250. And because the new machines, unlike artisans, will work in any country, they let manufacturers shift even more production to places like China, where the remainder of the labor can be done at much lower cost.</p>
        <p>Because the savings in labor costs are mostly passed on to the consumer, profit margins are no greater on these shoes than on unadorned Mary Janes. Companies stand to make big money only on big volume.</p>
        <p>Still, the advantage of the machines is not only that they can spangle and bead clothing and footwear, but that they are also doing a really good job of it. The factories, for example, work with the same nylon cord used by commercial fisherman to catch 60-pound tuna. That solves one age-old footwear problem: decorations can now be fastened to stay on past the first week of wear.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is improved leather imprinting that makes crocodile and python skins real enough to fool a taxidermist.</p>
        <p>Technology has also aided in making the mass market as swiftly fashion-responsive as the upper echelons of the shoe business have long been, but in a way that dismays high-end shoemakers: it also greatly speeds the copying of their designs.</p>
        <p>Trend-spotters for an American  design house shopping in Paris ''can take a digitized picture of a shoe they like, and it can be beamed to a factory in China within an hour,'' said Mr. Boettge, of the shoe retailer association.</p>
        <p>''The factory can then make a sample, send it by FedEx back to the company's office in Boston within 36 to 48 hours,'' he added. ''They can then decide to put it into production for the U.S. market, with a total turnaround of less than two months.''</p>
        <p>This season, there are plenty of examples that prove his point. ''We've had two shoes from Prada, one in silk linen, the other denim-colored, that we copied for the U.S. market,'' said Alan Abbott, director of sales and marketing at Majilite, a leading fabric provider for shoes and handbags, based in Lowell, Mass. ''It takes no longer than two months. Leathers can be done in two weeks. We are extremely proficient.''</p>
        <p>The Marketplace Test</p>
        <p>So with the shoe industry casting out new lines, the question is: Are women responding to the bait? Retailers say their gamble has been rewarded. ''Our customers have strongly embraced'' the new patterns, said Jack Minuk, Nordstrom's vice president for shoes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moran at Saks agreed, adding that sales in her shoe departments were ''outpacing sales in the rest of the store.''</p>
        <p>NPD, a market research firm based in Port Washington, N.Y., that tracks shoe sales in department stores only, says that in the first quarter of this year, women's shoe sales rose 10 percent, even as the sales percentage of black shoes declined by a little under a point. Meanwhile, the number of pairs sold with animal print patterns increased sixfold and the number with platform heels rose 70 percent, NPD said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Boettge, who represents the independent shoe sellers, says he is disappointed. ''It has helped, but it hasn't ignited the market,'' he said. ''People are buying, but they are not throwing out their old wardrobe.''</p>
        <p>Which is why merchants expect that next season will be even wilder: thigh-high red python boots, open-backed slides for winter and platform heels towering above 6 inches. Dream on, shoe designers, dream on.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about new designs in the women's shoe industry misspelled the brand name of suede moccasins that were listed as an example of the trends. It is J. P. Tod's, not Todd.</p>
