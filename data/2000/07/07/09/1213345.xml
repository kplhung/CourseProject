        <p>THE ruling images in the works that the Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus presented in New York from 1987 to 1991 were surprising. Dancers ducked as others threw bricks at them (the power of instinct); women in swinging hammocks swiped at men carrying eggs on trays (the fragility of male-female relations). The norm consisted of flying bodies, hairsbreadth timing, confrontational games and erotic aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>''Now, I don't need to throw a brick to show how intense instinct can be,'' the 37-year-old choreographer said. ''I'm more involved with text, with psychological intuition. What has changed in my work is that I'm more interested in the inner state of something.''</p>

        <p>THE ruling images in the works that the Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus presented in New York from 1987 to 1991 were surprising. Dancers ducked as others threw bricks at them (the power of instinct); women in swinging hammocks swiped at men carrying eggs on trays (the fragility of male-female relations). The norm consisted of flying bodies, hairsbreadth timing, confrontational games and erotic aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>''Now, I don't need to throw a brick to show how intense instinct can be,'' the 37-year-old choreographer said. ''I'm more involved with text, with psychological intuition. What has changed in my work is that I'm more interested in the inner state of something.''</p>
        <p>When Lincoln Center Festival 2000 presents his company, Ultima Vez, on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday at La Guardia High School, Mr. Vandekeybus suggests, his New York premiere, a collaboration with the American art-rock composer David Byrne, will differ from the pieces seen nine years ago.</p>
        <p>The title, ''In Spite of Wishing and Wanting,'' invites as many meanings as ever. ''My titles are never closed,'' Mr. Vandekeybus (pronounced van-de-KAY-bus) said in an interview. ''They are like a harbor for different fish to come in.'' If the same high energy is present in Ultima Vez, there is a new interest in the fantastic. A film within the piece is inspired by the magic realism of the Argentine writer Julio Cortazar, who died in 1984.</p>
        <p>The all-male cast includes a blind performer, Said Gharbi, a Moroccan who lives in Belgium. ''He is not portrayed as a blind person,'' Mr. Vandekeybus said. ''But his movement is different from the others, and he is an incredibly strong character. I started working with blind people because my movement language was getting so physical that I needed to work with the senses.''</p>
        <p>Amid the explosion of experimental dance and theater in Belgium in the 1980's, Mr. Vandekeybus's work stood apart for its raw quality. But like Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker and Jan Fabre, he used repetition within form that generated content about social alienation.</p>
        <p>Born in the small Flemish town of Herenthout, 20 miles from Antwerp, Mr. Vandekeybus accompanied his father, a veterinarian, on his rounds: ''I saw dramatic things, especially with farmers who were in a state of urgency, facing a problem they could not solve.'' While studying psychology at the University of Leuven for two years, he became involved in experimental theater. A mentor, Paul Peyskens (''A very interesting person, undervalued'') cast him in ''Don Carlos.'' The choreographer recalled: ''We had to know the text but we could do it out of order. I liked to open with the last act. Then the others had to react.''</p>
        <p>His current impulses are similar. ''Texts and actors that everybody knows often paralyze me,'' he wrote in a program note. ''It is as if they are overflowing with meaning and I cannot add anything to them.''</p>
        <p>After touring in an eight-hour production with Mr. Fabre, Mr. Vandekeybus turned to what he calls research into the reality of movement. The brick-throwing episode of ''What the Body Does Not Remember,'' his first piece, exemplified this exploration of ''the necessity for movement,'' as he termed it.</p>
        <p>''One of the biggest influences on that piece,'' he said, ''was the workshop I did with a 5-year-old boy.'' In fact, Mr. Vandekeybus had the child move in with him for three weeks, an experience that he connected to the themes of ''What the Body Does Not Remember.'' These were ''instinct, purity and complexity of free imagination,'' qualities he found in the boy, who is now a pilot. The boy's parents (the father is a psychiatrist) agreed to the experiment. ''I recall all this now that I have a 5-year-old child,'' Mr. Vandekeybus said.</p>
        <p>''In Spite of Wishing and Wanting'' has a different springboard. ''The whole piece is about how it is impossible to explain your deepest wish or desire,'' he said. ''It is dangerous to explain it -- it becomes an intellectual statement. But in dreams and sleep, your deepest wishes and fears can be expressed.''</p>
        <p>That is why the dancers often assume sleeping positions, even when they are standing up (head resting on elbow). ''They sleep in the air and wake up as they hit the floor,'' he said. ''This idea created a great deal of movement material.'' Similarly, a series of precise thrusts and parries resulted in a ''talking hands'' section through which partners attempt to communicate ''from one body to another,'' as the choreographer put it.</p>
        <p>''What do you really wish?'' Mr. Vandekeybus added rhetorically. ''It's beautiful to have this passion of wanting something. I don't like people without passion, who don't believe in things and have only scientific explanations. I believe in magic things, in energy.''</p>
