        <p>There is something about the celebration of Founders Day that showers luck on the Marymount School, the independent Catholic academy for girls across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue, which is about to renovate a six-story 100-year-old town house it acquired at 2 East 82nd Street.</p>
        <p>On Founders Day two years ago, at a time when the school, which occupies three combined town houses between 83rd and 84th Streets, was formulating a strategic plan for its future, including the possible purchase of a new building, a family approached Sister Kathleen Fagan, the headmistress, with an offer of a long-term, low-interest loan.</p>

        <p>There is something about the celebration of Founders Day that showers luck on the Marymount School, the independent Catholic academy for girls across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue, which is about to renovate a six-story 100-year-old town house it acquired at 2 East 82nd Street.</p>
        <p>On Founders Day two years ago, at a time when the school, which occupies three combined town houses between 83rd and 84th Streets, was formulating a strategic plan for its future, including the possible purchase of a new building, a family approached Sister Kathleen Fagan, the headmistress, with an offer of a long-term, low-interest loan.</p>
        <p>A committee of trustees, faculty, parents, students and alumnae had already decided that the school's enrollment should be increased, from about 425 to 500, and that its science, technology and cultural facilities should be expanded. The school had been searching for new premises in the neighborhood. The loan offer ''enabled us to look with more enthusiasm,'' said Sister Kathleen, who declined to identify the benefactors.</p>
        <p>Last year, again on Founders Day, Feb. 2, luck struck once more at an alumnae party. ''During dinner, Beth Werwaiss, president of the alumnae association, mentioned to me that the school, which had been searching for a site, was stepping up its efforts,'' said Marilyn Corradini, a Stribling &amp; Associates broker and a classmate of Mrs. Werwaiss in the class of 1961.</p>
        <p>''The next night, late in the office,'' Ms. Corradini said, ''my associate got a call about this magnificent Beaux-Arts mansion on 82nd Street. I immediately made an appointment to see it the next morning and called Beth.''</p>
        <p>''By Friday,'' Sister Kathleen recalled, ''the admissions director and I went in with the trustees and we fell in love with it.'' Ms. Corradini, who became Marymount's broker in the deal, said: ''It was meant to happen. The Beaux-Arts interior by design was an exact complement to the mansions on Fifth.''</p>
        <p>Six months of negotiations with the owner, the developer Peter S. Kalikow, ensued before the sale was completed. Mr. Kalikow had bought the town house intending to convert it into a garage entrance for the co-op tower he put up at 1001 Fifth Avenue, a plan that was eventually abandoned.</p>
        <p>The new building will house the middle school, grades four through seven. ''We realized we could build a special program for girls at a time when they often lose their feisty spirit,'' Sister Kathleen said.</p>
        <p>The school bought the property for $9.5 million. Renovations, to begin this month, are to cost $7 million. Opening is scheduled for August of next year.</p>
        <p>''We will be able to save the beautiful large rooms that run up the front of the building and that have lots of wood paneling, ornamental plaster moldings and fireplaces,'' said Samuel G. White, a partner in the architectural firm of Buttrick White &amp; Burtis, which is designing the renovation. In the middle of the building, a rickety turn-of-the-century elevator will be replaced with a modern one with access for people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>''In the rear,'' Mr. White said,  ''where there are few significant architectural features, we will put in specialty classrooms, a technology center, science lab and art studio, so you will have this nice foil of contemporary juxtaposed with traditional.''</p>
