        <p>During a recent pit party, spectators came down to the track to talk with the drivers and crews. Jeff Karns of Gales Ferry signed autographs for young fans before getting behind the wheel for his race.</p>
        <p>Karns, who when not racing, is co-owner of a garage in Groton. He began racing there seven years ago, at age 17. To help defray the costs of competition, which runs from April until the first week in September, he has enlisted 19 sponsors, including the New London Police Department, which brings troubled teenagers to the track to cheer for him.</p>
