        <p>Five years ago, J. K. Rowling, a struggling, single mother in Edinburgh, completed a children's novel, written mostly in coffee shops. Today  ''Harry Potter'' is the biggest publishing phenomenon in history.</p>
        <p>''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and two sequels, all about an orphaned boy with wizard powers, have sold nearly 21 million copies. The fourth book -- ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' -- is being published with the kind of hoopla reserved for the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The book was published yesterday, when a record first printing of 3.8 million copies went on sale in the United States. Scholastic Inc., released the book at 12:01 a.m., and bookstores around the nation gave midnight ''Harry Potter'' parties, with clerks dressed as wizards and witches.</p>
        <p>''People have been excited about this for months,'' said Barbara Theroux, owner of the Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont.</p>
        <p>Despite the extraordinary secrecy with which the book was published, newspapers report that several lucky children in Virginia received early copies. An 8-year-old girl in Fairfax got one from a clerk who apparently didn't realize the book was embargoed, and a Richmond Wal-Mart store mistakenly sold 20 copies before the book was pulled from the shelves.</p>
        <p>To the delight of Scholastic and Warner Brothers, which owns the movie rights, Ms. Rowling has promised three more ''Harry Potter'' books before the series concludes.</p>
