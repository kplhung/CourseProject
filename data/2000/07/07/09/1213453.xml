        <p>THE last time we visited the American Clock and Watch Museum and the New England Carousel Museum in Bristol, we couldn't find a good quality place to have lunch, so we settled for a McChain. This trip, a year later, we discovered Confetti, a fortuitous choice that is actually next door in Plainville.</p>
        <p>There is nothing high falutin' about Confetti, which was named for the cabaret that is the subject of a Toulouse-Lautrec poster (there's a copy near the door).</p>
        <p>This Confetti's Mediterranean menu seemed well-suited to a warm summer day. In cooler weather, we would have had lunch on the flower-edged terrace, with its jaunty green umbrellas, but it was humid enough for us to appreciate the air-conditioning instead.</p>
        <p>Although Mediterranean-accented, most portions are American style, i.e. gargantuan. An appetizer of golden sesame-crusted cauliflower was so large we couldn't do justice to the entree. For lunch, diners will do just fine ordering one of the homey soups that change daily, like the hearty chicken barley, rife with carrots and onions, followed by an appetizer such as the sesame seed-sprinkled, crisp-fried, large cauliflower flowerets. Such a twosome, rounded off with one of the desserts made on the premises -- like the mammoth serving of pistachio cake (as light and feathery as mother might have made, with a back-to-childhood fluffy, sweet frosting) -- can send you happily on your way.</p>
        <p>Similar largesse is evident at dinner, so the same rule might apply: two starters and dessert or entree and dessert. (A small green salad with grape tomatoes in balsamic vinaigrette came with our entrees.)</p>
        <p>Baked portobello mushroom restored our faith in this once-novel, now cliched, appetizer. In Confetti's version, two huge caps were topped with melted Gorgonzola cheese, served on a bed of varied greens; it was delicious. Then came manicotti francesca: three large crepes filled with ricotta, topped with melted mozzarella and a sprinkle of coarsely grated Parmesan, graced by a fresh-tasting marinara sauce.</p>
        <p>Another entree that hit the spot was the Grecian lamb shank (two shanks served at dinner, one at lunch), reasonably tender, served with tomato, rice and a hint of garlic. Grilled salmon portobello (with baby greens and roasted mushrooms in a balsamic reduction), and linguine with clam sauce (with fresh shucked clams, minced mushroom bits, garlic, basil and sun-dried tomatoes) were also satisfying main courses.</p>
        <p>As for dessert: we were partial to mousse madness, a duo of darker and lighter firm chocolate mousse in a chocolate crust, as well as the old-fashioned pistachio cake, but skip the canister-whipped cream that adorned each. Forget also the clunky, chunky bread pudding.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses each, cost $45.35, before drinks, tax or tip. With most dinner entrees in the $15-$16 range, Confetti offers excellent value. A small but carefully selected wine list, mostly from California, begins at $20. A couple of offbeat microbrewery ales are on tap.</p>
        <p>While nothing we tried at Confetti was in the remarkable category, the restaurant offers real value and family-friendly atmosphere.</p>
        <p>A La Carte</p>
        <p>Ever alert for cozy tea shops, in Stonington we found the YELLOW HOUSE COFFEE AND TEA ROOM (149 Water Street; 860-535-4986), a spot with just six tables. Its specialty is coffee, but it also serves tea (made with bags, but never mind). Have a cup of java and lemon teacake or sour cream coffee cake with walnuts.</p>
        <p>Authentic French pastry shops are hard to come by in Connecticut. That's what makes PATISSERIE MIRABELLE (165 Boston Post Road, Old Saybrook; 860-395-1189) a welcome treat. In minuscule space, the chef-owner, Francois Trawalter, formerly of Vong in New York, turns out marvels such as Paris-Brest, peach danish, Linzertorte and pear almond tart with an apricot glaze.</p>
