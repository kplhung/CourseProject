        <p>Frustrated that a gas station and convenience store near Van Cortlandt Park has become a hangout for rowdy teenagers, neighbors are asking the Getty Corporation to shut it until a more responsive operator is found.</p>
        <p>At the root of the problem, community leaders say, is the frequent sale of beer to minors, who spend time in a dark area near the station, at 260th Street and Broadway, in North Riverdale, drinking, playing loud music and spraying graffiti.</p>
        <p>Officers from the 50th Precinct arrested the station's operator, Ziad Alzubi, on May 29 for selling alcohol to minors, said Detective Luis Rodriguez of the precinct's community-affairs unit. Several summonses were also issued for sales in January, Detective Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>Neighbors in this otherwise quiet community in the northwest reaches of the borough say the problem has continued despite the arrest and are now asking that something more substantial be done.</p>
        <p>''This has been an eyesore and a real trouble spot for the community,'' said Laura Spalter, the president of the Riverdale Community Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alzubi said he was being unfairly blamed for events beyond his control. The community group and the police are making him a scapegoat, he said.</p>
        <p>''I work hard, I pay taxes, I own a business,'' he said. ''I cannot be responsible for graffiti and the behavior of the local kids.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alzubi said he had never knowingly sold alcohol to minors.</p>
        <p>Community leaders said Mr. Albuzi had created his own problems.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spalter contacted Getty, which leases the station to Mr. Alzubi, in June, asking for action against him.</p>
        <p>Victor Mangal, Getty's sales manager for the Bronx, said this week that Getty had been cooperating with the community to find a solution. ''I spoke at length with Mr. Alzubi, and I think that he has a good understanding of what needs to be done,'' Mr. Mangal said, adding ''We would only evict him as a last resort.''</p>
