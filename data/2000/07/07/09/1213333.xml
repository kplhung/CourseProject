        <p>I DID have a favorite Beatle (Paul, strictly for his looks). If pressed, I would name a favorite character on ''Friends'' (Phoebe, for her self-esteem). But choosing a favorite Satellite Sister is impossible.</p>
        <p>I identify with Liz because she quit her big, important corporate job on her 40th birthday and went out in search of something new. With Julie because she's an adventurer, living in Bangkok now and signing up for all kinds of projects even though, as she says, ''I know eight words in Thai.'' With Monica because she's single and devoted to her ''small but needy'' dog. With Sheila because she lives in Greenwich Village, the center of my emotional universe, and once let herself get into a teeny bit of trouble with credit card debt. And with Lian because she's completely overcommitted but, when she grabs a free hour, spends it having an all-Lancome beauty makeover.</p>
        <p>These are actually the Dolan sisters, originally from a big middle-class family in Fairfield, Conn. But once they grew up they moved to various parts of the country, and since April they have been WNYC Radio's rising stars. Their taped hourlong talk show is so highly thought of that it was given the celebrity time slot on WNYC-FM: 11 a.m. on Saturdays in New York, right after ''Car Talk,'' public radio's ratings champion. (On WNYC-AM, the show goes on at 1 p.m.) ''Satellite Sisters'' has included segments on breast self-examination, home ownership and a troublesome gravy boat. It sometimes tests guests' compatibility with their hosts based on the answers to the questions ''Do you lie to your doctor?'' (perhaps about how many glasses of wine you have daily) and ''Do you remember where you were when you heard about the death of Princess Diana?'' Last month the show went national.</p>
        <p>Let me take back the ''talk show'' part. The Dolans, ages 35 to 44 (Julie turns 45 this month), have been saying for months now that what they do instead is conversation radio. Which must mean that the sisters don't think very highly of talk radio.</p>
        <p>''It's frequently primarily structured around confrontation, and kind of staged,'' says Liz. ''Real life and real conversation don't actually unfold that way.''</p>
        <p>What the Satellite Sisters do on the air is get together for a big sisterly conference call. Liz is usually in New York (although she divides her time between Manhattan and Portland, Ore.), Lian is in Pasadena, Calif., and Julie comes in via satellite from Bangkok (thus the show's name). The other two sisters -- Monica in Portland and Sheila in New York -- are sometimes also on the line, depending on their schedules. The show does have guests (an expert on home ownership and credit from Fannie Mae in Washington, a sympathetic dermatologist, a friend suffering from post-partum everything), but the exchanges are often among the siblings themselves. There is a lot of laughing.</p>
        <p>''It's original, a real breath of fresh air,'' says their executive producer, Marjorie Kalins. ''It was probably a gutsy move on our part to do this.''</p>
        <p>The show's conceit, she explains, is that it's the Dolans' Saturday morning catch-up-on-things telephone call. ''What the sisters try to do is to bring a certain approach to life,'' she continues. ''It's about the support that you get through life with.'' Which means that when Julie is talking about transporting the gravy boat -- which she uses only once a year, at Thanksgiving -- during the move to Thailand, she's really talking about all the angst involved in making such a huge change. And, as the sisters and their fans point out, this is the way most people talk with their friends and families about the difficult chapters in their lives. They tell the funny version. And it helps.</p>
        <p>''They are connecting with our listeners in very powerful and strong ways,'' says Laura Walker, WNYC's president. ''They talk about what's really important -- choices and transitions.''</p>
        <p>Of the show, she says: ''It sounds different. It is different.''</p>
        <p>That's something Ms. Walker recognized right away when she first got a call about the idea two years ago. That was not long after Liz had given up her job as vice president for global marketing at Nike and was looking for something new and interesting (but less life-engulfing) to do. Her siblings shared that point of view.</p>
        <p>''We all wanted to still live our own lives,'' says Julie, who had just made a job change as well, one that gave her more free time. ''I had two requirements. I didn't want to have to travel and I didn't want to get dressed up.''</p>
        <p>During a weekend together at a mud-bath spa in California, the sisters started talking about their goals. At some point Julie's husband suggested they come up with something they could do as a group, since the women clearly loved spending time together. Pretty soon they had a single sheet of paper outlining the idea. Then Liz picked up the phone and called Ms. Walker, who had been working at Children's Television Workshop when Liz was handling a Nike tie-in there. (''I think I was the only person she knew in radio,'' Ms. Walker says. Absolutely true, say the Dolans.)</p>
        <p>Liz's ''Remember me?'' call turned into what the sisters imagined would be a 15-minute meeting. Liz, Julie and Lian sat down with Ms. Walker in the lobby bar of the  Hilton in San Francisco. When they got up two hours later, they'd been invited to do a pilot. Their timing was good, because WNYC was re-evaluating its weekend schedule and Ms. Walker was particularly interested in getting more women's voices on radio. The next thing you know, ''Satellite Sisters'' had producers. They taped the first segments in August and September 1998 and spent the next year-and-a-half doing ''a lot of massaging'' to the concept.</p>
        <p>At one point they wondered if this idea of having every sister in a different city was such a great one. But when they did test segments in which they were together in one room, the sisters found they relied too much on body language. The physical separation made for better radio.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago they were all together for the first time in a year, in New York for a ''creative summit,'' a development meeting about future shows. Seated around a table in a 24th-floor conference room, they talked and laughed in much the same way they do on the air. Lian referred to ''trying to squeeze in this radio show around preschool.'' Sheila mentioned that her 17-year-old daughter had seen ''The Vagina Monologues'' three times. The group declared themselves major radio fans, with particular affection for Don Imus, contemporary music and public radio of all kinds.</p>
        <p>Encouraged to characterize one another in the most oversimplified ways possible, they described Julie as ''the conservative, classic one'' (she's also the oldest, a former academic, married, with two teenage sons); Liz, ''the bossy one'' and ''the successful one'' (she's the second oldest and single); Monica, the nurturer (she is, in fact, a nurse and single); Sheila, ''the renegade'' and ''the independent one'' (she started and still runs a public elementary school on Hudson Street, is divorced but romantically attached and has a teenage daughter); and Lian as ''sassy, the smart one'' (she's the youngest, a writer, married, with two boys).</p>
        <p>Listeners, however, are more likely to think of each sister in terms of particular segments or passing comments. After recent shows, Lian may be remembered as the one who was having her house remodeled, Sheila as the dermaholic (the one who owns entirely too many skin care products), Liz as the one who announced ''I have an animal in my attic'' and so on.</p>
        <p>While they were in town they planned to do some quintessentially New York things together but hadn't decided what. Julie was hoping to reacquaint herself with American culture; having been in Bangkok for a while now, she drew a complete blank when people made references to ''The Sopranos'' and ''Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire.'' And they planned to go to Liz's Upper West Side apartment on Saturday morning to listen to their radio show all together for the first time.</p>
        <p>THEN it's back to what is now their regular routine of e-mail and telephone communication, including the real (off the air) weekly conference call. The call is now regularly scheduled when it's 6 a.m. for Julie, 4 p.m. for Lian and 7 p.m. for Liz. ''We had tried it originally with Julie on the midnight shift,'' says Liz. But there was some question as to whether Julie was actually awake during the call.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Ms. Kalins feels confident that all of America is ready for ''Satellite Sisters.''</p>
        <p>''We are hitting a nerve or a pulse point or whatever, and about 25 percent of our responses come from men,'' she says. The show is ''about life -- in the same way that 'Car Talk' is not just about cars.''</p>
