        <p>You often hear that a player has the advantage of the two bishops, but what of the poor knights? No one ever brags about them.

        <p>But when they obtain conditions favorable to their strengths, they can be  mighty soldiers. They are not long-distance fighters, yet close to the enemy lines, they can be devastating.</p>

        <p>You often hear that a player has the advantage of the two bishops, but what of the poor knights? No one ever brags about them. When they do triumph, they are never singled out for their trenchant performance, but are treated as though they were merely  anonymous workhorses during the campaign.</p>
        <p>But when they obtain conditions favorable to their strengths, they can be  mighty soldiers. They are not long-distance fighters, yet close to the enemy lines, they can be devastating.</p>
        <p>That was seen in the decisive game between Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and Aleksandr Grischuk of Russia in the Olympic Capital Young Masters Tournament in Lausanne, Switzerland, May 30 to June 4. Ponomariov, a former youngest grandmaster, was the favorite in the knockout event, but was upset by Grischuk, not yet 17, and his trusty steeds.</p>
        <p>The Scotch Game, appearing after 4 Nd4, quickly takes over the pawn center, but the classical opinion has been that it fails to suppress quick black development.</p>
        <p>Grischuk has a penchant for the unusual 7 . . . b6!? in place of the routine 7 . . . O-O or 7 . . . Ne5. Whether it is better or not, he just plays it better than his opponents.</p>
        <p>After 8 . . . Bb7, the most aggressive line might be 9 f4 O-O-O 10 Qd2 d5 11 e5 Qh4 12 Bd3 Kb8 13 b4 Bd4 14 cd g6 15 Na3 Nf5 16 Nc2 Qe7 17 Rab1, as in a D. Pedersen-J. Christensen game at Aarhus 1993. Ponomariov's 9 Nb3 is tame.</p>
        <p>After 10 . . . bc, there was no point in 11 Bd5 because 11 . . . Nd5 12 ed Ba6 13 Re1 O-O 14 Bc5 Nd3 15 Bd4 Qf5 is strong for Black.</p>
        <p>After 13 Bc5, Ponomariov has won the bishop pair, but his pawn center is gone.</p>
        <p>After 15 . . . Nd5, it was clear that  Black's knights were happily active.</p>
        <p>Ponomariov's 16 g3 stemmed a knight invasion with 16 . . . Nf4, but it constituted a weakening of the h1/a8 diagonal of the enemy bishop. After 16  . . . Qg6, 17 f4?!, planning to retake the h1/a8 diagonal after a knight retreat with 18 Bf3, would be sharply countered by 17 . . . c5!? 18 Qb3 Rab8 19 Be5 de 20 fe Ne3 21 Rf2 Bf3 22 Qa4 Be2 23 Re2 Qd3! with decisive advantage for Grischuk.</p>
        <p>After 17 Kh1, Grischuk moved to penetrate to the e3 square with 17 . . . Ng4! If 18 fg, then 18 . . . Nc3 19 Bf3 Nd1 20 Bb7 Qd3 wins for him.</p>
        <p>After 21 . . . f4!, Ponomariov could not defend by 22 gf Nf4 23 Be4 because 23 . . . d5 24 fg Re4 25 Na5 Re2! 26 Qe2 d4! 27 Qf3 Bf3 28 Rf3 Qg5 29 Nb3 Qd5 30 Nd4 Ne2 is crushing.</p>
        <p>Also, 22 Kg2 was hopeless against 22  . . . Nh2! 23 Bh2 fg 24 Bh7 Kh8 25 Bg3 Nf4 26 Kf2 Qh3 27 Rg1 Bf3! 28 Kf3 Nd3 29 Bf5 Rf5mate. Ponamariov could not answer 22 . . . Nde3 by 23 Ne3 fe 24 Qd1 Nf2 25 Rf2 ef 26 Qb3 Kh8 27 Qb7 because 27 . . . Re1 wins.</p>
        <p>But the knight-for-rook endgame he found himself in after 32 . . . de was quite hopeless.</p>
        <p>Ponamariov lingered until 46 . . .  Ra4 persuaded him to quit wasting his time.</p>
