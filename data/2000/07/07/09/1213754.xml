        <p>If it had been Chuck Knoblauch's choice, he would have been on the No. 7 train out of Shea Stadium yesterday afternoon with me and the rest of the city's more social baseball fans.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees and the Mets, those pampered wimps, rode the bus, with a full police escort.</p>
        <p>''I rode the No. 7 train out Friday night,'' Knoblauch said after his role in a pair of weird obstruction plays with Todd Zeile helped position the Yankees to a 4-2 victory in the Queens portion of the day-night doubleheader and before the Yankees won again by 4-2 in the Bronx. ''Nobody bothered me.''</p>
        <p>Nobody threatened him. Nobody teased him about his throwing mechanics. He signed autographs, as he often does when he rides the No. 4 train to and from Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''I like the silver trains better than the red ones,'' he decided.</p>
        <p>Silver or red, it was a much better day to be on the rails than on the roadway. When the doors swung open on the No. 7 line, the best air-conditioning there is blew through the car and brought a refreshing rush that felt like September. It was that kind of day around New York City, when its major league baseball teams were playing day and night, in Queens and the Bronx, and if you closed your eyes, took in the breeze, you could feel the energy of a late-season race.</p>
        <p>Even with no direct line and having to connect via Manhattan, the train was the way to beat the traffic, to feel the buzz, to hear the fans delight in bargain midtown parking rates and plan a dinner stop on the East Side between games.</p>
        <p>That's what I did, dinner excluded, driving into Midtown yesterday morning, parking the car, buying three tokens and riding the local out to Shea. I love taking subways to ballgames, always have, from the time my father took me to Yankee Stadium for the first time. It was a long ride, with a change of lines, from Saratoga Avenue in Brooklyn on up into the South Bronx. But at least the train kept moving, and you could study the faces of the other fans and not worry about timing your exit out of the park.</p>
        <p>This may be a symptom of middle age, but these days, just the thought of a game-day traffic jam, to or from, is enough to keep me home.</p>
        <p>Even with the police escort, the managers and some of the players were pretty cranky about having to move the bats and balls. Bobby Valentine, in fact, foresaw only one potential upside from the first doubleheader in different stadiums in 97 years.</p>
        <p>''Joe will probably have to shave three times,'' he said. ''I'll only have to shave once.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he could think of any positives, Joe Torre quickly answered, ''No.''</p>
        <p>The good news is that at least he remembered that the manager and the players get paid a few nickels to be inconvenienced. The fans pay for the privilege of following them around.</p>
        <p>''The only thing is that more fans will get to see the games than if we played in one place,'' Torre said. ''That's good. That's an up side. This is a city it works in.''</p>
        <p>Since interleague play began, Torre has hardly been its most sanguine supporter. It could be that a man who works for George Steinbrenner would prefer to not have to deal with the crosstown rival. More likely it's the veteran journeyman in this Brooklyn native who knows that Baltimore at Philadelphia does not exactly cause traffic delays along Interstate 95.</p>
        <p>That opens another argument, for if the Mets and Yankees were of the combined quality of the Orioles and Phillies, forget Doc Gooden's five gutsy innings that earned him the victory and another start. Tom Seaver coming out of retirement would not have sold out either site.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch may have big trouble with his arm but he knows how to get around with his legs. He navigated the base paths yesterday afternoon as he does the subway, twice becoming entangled with Zeile and twice getting the benefit of the call.</p>
        <p>Lee Mazzilli helped the first time, reminding the young first-base umpire, Robb Cook, of what he had just seen -- Knoblauch having to navigate his way around Zeile on the way to being thrown out at second on a leadoff hit in the first. Valentine saw something else, and it was the color of the train Knoblauch likes least. The Yankees scored two runs and Valentine was ejected, so he didn't get to argue the next call against Zeile, for knocking over Knoblauch on his way to second base on a ground ball hit by Jay Payton.</p>
        <p>''Strange occurrences,'' Knoblauch said, as he slipped his bag over his shoulder on his way to the bus, saying, yes, he'd prefer the train.</p>
        <p>The obstruction calls gave people something for people talk about, at least until Game 2 in the Bronx. And that is the point of all this, to keep them talking about a regular season that stretches across six months. There are worse workplace abuses than doubleheaders that force players to hit and run.</p>
