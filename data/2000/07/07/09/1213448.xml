        <p>WHAT, exactly, is ''Ancestral Voices?''</p>
        <p>A family story, the subtitle reads. The five actors are all carrying their scripts, say the stage directions. Thus it has been called a reading, a staged reading, a hybrid, a radio drama, a concert performance, even a fluke.</p>
        <p>Ask the man who wrote it, A. R. Gurney, one of Connecticut's major playwrights, and he says simply, ''I think it's a play.''</p>
        <p>''Yes, it definitely is a play,'' adds David Saint, who is directing ''Ancestral Voices,'' which is to run with two different casts for two weeks, tomorrow through July 22, at the Westport Country Playhouse.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take a theater know-it-all to put it together.</p>
        <p>''Ancestral Voices'' is ''Love Letters'' plus three.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gurney's well-known two-character play, which began its professional life at the Long Wharf in New Haven, has been crisscrossing the country for 13 years, with innumerable dream pairings (Elaine Stritch and Jason Robards) as well as seemingly unlikely ones (Whoopi Goldberg and Timothy Dalton). And there's no let-up; Joan Collins and Stacey Keach are on tour.</p>
        <p>Which means that, play or no play, ''Love Letters'' is an annuity for Mr. Gurney -- not to mention a handy stopover of a week or so -- for actors who don't have to memorize a word. And the starrier the casts, the bigger the audiences; some people have seen ''Love Letters'' over and over.</p>
        <p>But this one requires real acting, said the playwright of ''Ancestral Voices.'' And direction, too.</p>
        <p>One recalls that John Tillinger -- who was billed as the director of ''Love Letters'' at Long Wharf, Off Broadway and on Broadway -- conceded that there wasn't much to direct. Actually, he said, there wasn't anything to direct.</p>
        <p>Two actors enter, holding scripts (their letters). They sit at a table. They do not get up. They do not look at each other. They read. They wear what they wear. And there is no set.</p>
        <p>But ''Ancestral Voices'' is not only another story, but also a real job for a director. ''There's more than you would think,'' Mr. Saint said. ''This one is more complex. It's like orchestrating a chamber piece, a tone poem. You have to be sure everyone is in the right world; they can't appear too strident. And there are costumes and a painterly set as well as light and sound cues.''</p>
        <p>The actors remain seated, however. ''Ancestral Voices'' can be played in anger; it is not a happy story, but rather an ambiguous one. Eddie, the narrator, is the grown-up grandson, looking back at the time his grandmother left his grandfather for another man. That was not done in a Protestant family in Buffalo in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>''This started to be a play,'' Eddie begins, ''but it went too many places for the stage.'' He adds: ''So it tried to be a book, but people kept wanting to talk.''</p>
        <p>That is Mr. Gurney's dead-on scripted account of how ''Ancestral Voices'' evolved. Nobody wanted to publish it, after he wrote it as a book, he said. Then he read a piece of it at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, ''and the audience seemed interested,'' Mr. Gurney said, ''and people asked what comes next, and I thought, this works!'' And squeezing it in, Mr. Gurney said, at Lincoln Center on  dark nights at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater worked.</p>
        <p>Besides Eddie, the characters in ''Ancestral Voices'' are his mother Jane, his father Harvey as well as his grandmother and grandfather.</p>
        <p>''Shock waves reverberate throughout three generations,'' said Mr. Saint, who directed ''Ancestral Voices'' for a four-week run in May at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, N.J., where he is the artistic director.</p>
        <p>Can Mr. Gurney's troubled autobiographically-rooted story with its time leaps and 40 location shifts work as a full-out play?</p>
        <p>That would diminish its allure for actors on the run. ''They are used to, and they like, readings,'' Mr. Saint said. ''Besides, the audience's imagination is its essential theatrical component. You have to dignify the audience, bestow upon them respect for their inteligence,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In a search for the label that people seem to need for such a work, story theater came up, but of course, that was already taken by the improvisational theater group of the 60's. ''It's like storytelling,'' Mr. Saint went on, ''but it is a play about the struggle to hold onto cherished traditions'' -- a classic Gurney theme -- ''and the iconoclast within, wanting to bash them.''</p>
        <p>''And there are all these wonderful actors,'' Mr. Saint said. At Lincoln Center, among others there were Irene Worth, Blythe Danner, Elizabeth Wilson and Philip Bosco in rotating casts.</p>
        <p>During New Jersey's first week of ''Ancestral Voices,'' George Grizzard and Frances Sternhagen did not wield the box office power that is their rightful claim at this stage of their illustrious careers.</p>
        <p>But at Westport, Mr. Gurney's theater piece -- and there's the indisputable answer to what ''Ancestral Voices'' is -- might as well be called the Paul Newman-Joanne Woodward show.</p>
        <p>The star couple are appearing with Swoosie Kurtz, James Naughton and Paul Rudd, during the second week of performances.</p>
        <p>When a would-be ticket buyer called the box office about ticket availability, the answer was ''completely, totally, utterly sold out.'' The caller was further informed that all tickets for that week were gone 10 hours after sales began. But a fair number were still available for the first week, he added.</p>
        <p>So, see Frank Converse, Jane Curtin, Neil Patrick Harris, Fritz Weaver and Elizabeth Wilson during the first week. They read, they act, they live.</p>
        <p>They go on, like Mr. Gurney, even though he's already won two Lortel awards for lifetime achievement in the theater.</p>
