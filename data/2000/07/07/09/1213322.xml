        <p>ONE hazy afternoon last August my wife, Phillis, and I retraced the entire route of the Lewis and Clark expedition in half an hour. Our trip began and ended in the vast, semicircular hall of photomurals in the Museum of Westward Expansion, at the foot of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis. Here, on the west bank of the Mississippi, just a few miles downriver from the expedition's winter camp of 1803-4, we gazed up at the snow-capped Rockies, as glimpsed by the explorers for the first time; traveled mile upon mile on the upper Missouri River; and stood atop Lemhi Pass, on the Continental Divide, where Meriwether Lewis realized what a huge tract of wilderness still lay between him and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>Inspired by this spectacular virtual odyssey -- and by the approach of the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase completed by President Jefferson in 1803 -- we decided to strike out in the footsteps of Meriwether Lewis's Corps of Discovery, commissioned by Jefferson to find the most ''practicable water communication across this continent.''</p>
        <p>Our plan was to visit some of the lesser-known, out-of-the-way sites on the Lewis and Clark Trail, and to see for ourselves how much of the country along the expedition's route still looked more or less as it had when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark described it in their journals.</p>
        <p>The next morning, we began our seven-day journey to the Pacific, more than 2,000 miles away. We would stay in motels, and travel by car, mainly on Interstates to save time to explore the sites we wanted to visit, most of which were half a day's drive apart. Our route would take us across some of the most varied topography in the West: from the Great Plains, across the Rockies and on to the Columbia River basin and the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Our first discovery came the following afternoon at Lewis and Clark State Park at Blue Lake, Iowa, about 400 miles from St. Louis. Blue Lake is a cut-off oxbow in the original course of the Missouri River.  Stranded about four miles east of the present-day Missouri, much of which has been dredged and straightened, this stretch of water hasn't changed appreciably since the Corps of Discovery traveled up it in August of 1804.</p>
        <p>During the first leg of their trip on the big river, the explorers relied on two flat-bottomed pirogues and a one-masted keelboat that they sailed, poled and sometimes hauled up the current by main force. We finished our nature hike at the park's 55-foot-long made-to-scale replica of the keelboat, named Discovery, which was used by Ken Burns in his 1997 documentary, ''Lewis and Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery,'' and now floats in Blue Lake.</p>
        <p>We spent that night in Fargo, N.D., a good jumping-off place for the northern plains. Late the following morning, after a four-hour drive through high, rolling prarie, we arrived at the Knife River Indian Villages of the National Park Service, near Stanton, N.D. Perched on an airy plateau on the high plains above the Missouri, some 60 miles north of Bismarck, the site is only a few miles upriver from the 1804-5 winter camp of the corps. For centuries, Indian traders from throughout the northern plains convened at Knife River each summer to barter for local flint, prized for arrowheads and cutting tools. Seeking information about the unknown territory they were about to penetrate, Lewis and Clark conferred here with the Hidatsa residents who lived in large earthen lodges, similar to the one recreated by the Park Service at Knife River. About 40 feet in diameter and 20 feet high, the structure feels otherworldly, from the bleached buffalo skulls resting on its roof to the exotic scent of its cottonwood support beams. In  such a dwelling, Meriwether Lewis administered a potion made from a snake's rattles to the Shoshone captive Sacagawea, to ease her labor during the birth of her son, who would accompany her to the Pacific and back with the corps.</p>
        <p>Outside, we admired a garden patterned after those where the Hidatsas and their Mandan neighbors grew nine varieties of corn. Down at the river, the remoteness was nearly palpable. Some of the exposed buffalo bones in the bluff above us might have dated from the winter of 1804-1805. The only sounds were the swift-running Missouri and the prairie wind.</p>
        <p>Still looking for out-of-the-way places, we spent part of the second afternoon and evening and most of the third day of our trip making the 700-mile trek from Knife River to Montana's Great Falls, near Ryan Dam on the upper Missouri. The suspension footbridge to the island just below the dam bounced, swayed and vibrated under our hiking boots as we made our way across it, with the river rushing along far below. Spray from the falls gusted into our faces. We had to shout to make ourselves heard over the thundering cataract, which Lewis called ''the grandest sight I ever beheld.''</p>
        <p>Though diminished by hydroelectric projects, the falls is still an impressive sight. We ambled down to the foot of the island, where the dizzying current roared by on each side. Members of the corps took nearly a month to portage around them, encountering grizzly bears, hail that knocked them off their feet, and heat so intense that they repeatedly fainted. On this fiercely hot late-summer afternoon, we were amused to note that the big fish finning in the deep green pool just below the falls were not the cutthroat trout discovered here by the corps, and later named Salmo clarkii, for William Clark, but European carp, transplanted to the Missouri many decades later.</p>
        <p>Lemhi Pass, on the Idaho-Montana border, is accessible only by miles of steep gravel roads through private and National Forest land. Driving under the Bar Double T ranch gate earlier that morning -- our fourth -- then stopping to let a dozen range cattle saunter across the lane, Phillis and I had both experienced the sense that we were entering a much earlier part of the last century. As we crept up a series of steep switchbacks, a bull elk, with five points on each side of his massive antlers, stepped out of the lodgepole pines near the top of the pass. A minute later a low-slung badger ran across the road. A golden eagle circling high over the ridge dipped down to take a look at him, then soared off in search of smaller prey.</p>
        <p>Lewis called the rill that rises in the Sacagawea campground ''the most distant fountain of the waters of the mighty Missouri.'' Though he miscalculated by a watershed or two, Phillis and I saw exactly what he had seen in 1805 -- not the hoped-for headwaters of the Columbia River, but range after range of ''high mountains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow.''</p>
        <p>With winter just around the corner, it must have been an unsettling vista. The explorers took it in stride, however. They scouted up Sacagawea's Shoshone relatives, purchased horses and proceeded on toward the Bitterroots and Lolo Pass -- the most harrowing part of their journey to the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Phillis and I reached Lolo Pass the next day. ''Winding Road Next 77 Miles,'' the sign at the top of the pass read; this turned out to be a striking instance of Western understatement. Route 12, the two-lane highway from the Travelers' Rest campsite in Montana to Lowell, Idaho, was the most scenic mountain highway, and the steepest, we'd ever driven. Little wonder that the explorers' horses lost their footing and tumbled down these mountainsides while the men, wandering in September blizzards, lost their way. To fend off starvation, they ate two of their colts.</p>
        <p>A few miles across the Idaho line, we turned north onto a logging road, drove up to a Forest Service trailhead, then hiked the remaining mile or so to the ridge-top route of the corps. Here, in the most remote territory we'd explored since leaving St. Louis, we saw a Clark's nutcracker,  a Steller's jay and a mule deer --- new to science when named by the explorers for its comically long, mule-like ears.</p>
        <p>Back on Route 12, we stopped beside the Lochsa River to watch the most skillful angler on the water that afternoon: a diving osprey that nabbed a foot-long cutthroat out of the rushing river.</p>
        <p>Rivers structured our itinerary, as they did that of the corps. On the sixth afternoon of our trip, in the arid rain shadow of eastern Oregon, we reached the great Columbia River.  Two hundred years ago, the Columbia abounded with rapids that the local Indian population thought were unnavigable -- until the Corps of Discovery proved otherwise. But today the biggest river in the northwestern United States is broken not by Class V whitewater, but by hydroelectric dams backing up huge impoundments as placid as Vermont mill ponds.</p>
        <p>For a glimpse of what the Columbia once was, we left Oregon's Interstate 84, just below the looming hydro project at The Dalles, drove across a high, bright orange suspension bridge on Route 197, and parked in a pull-off on the Washington side of the river. Not far below the nearby dam, a young man was spin-casting the rapids.</p>
        <p>When Lewis and Clark passed through The Dalles in the fall of 1805, this stretch of the Columbia was the salmon capital of the world. Today, as we watched from atop the riverbank, the angler below us hooked a hard-fighting steelhead trout, which jumped twice before he brought it to the net and released it.</p>
        <p>The next day -- our last -- we pushed on for the Pacific. ''Ocian in view! O! the joy,'' William Clark wrote in his journal on Nov. 7, 1805, near the mouth of the Columbia. But that winter the corps camped several miles inland, near the present site of Astoria, Ore.; and by early January, Sacagawea still hadn't seen the ocean. When a whale washed up onto a nearby beach, Clark wrote that ''she observed that she had traveled a long way with us to see the great waters and that now that [a] monstrous fish was also to be seen, she thought it very hard she could not be permitted to see either.''</p>
        <p>Good-natured William Clark took Sacagawea to view the ocean; but on this last evening of our trip, it appeared as though Phillis and I might not see the Pacific ourselves. Although we were standing on Cannon Beach, listening to the nearby breakers, we couldn't see them because of a thick layer of fog. With less than two hours of daylight left, we sat down on a Ponderosa drift log, hoping that the visibility would clear.  Like Sacagawea, we wanted very much to see ''the great waters.''</p>
        <p>Just at sunset, we did. A breeze came up, and the fog began to tatter apart. A patch of deep-green water, crested by white, appeared. Then another. ''The grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed,'' Clark wrote. ''Inoumerable rocks of emence Sise out at a great distance from the Shore and against which the Seas brak with great force gives this Coast a most romantic appearance.''</p>
        <p>To us, it looked exactly the way  William Clark had described it nearly 200 years ago, a few weeks before the Corps of Discovery started the long trek east to report their wonderful discoveries to Thomas Jefferson.</p>

        <p>Resources</p>
        <p>Before striking out, Lewis and Clark fans may want to consult, as we did, Stephen E. Ambrose's ''Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West'' (Simon &amp; Schuster); ''The Journals of Lewis and Clark,'' edited by Bernard DeVoto (Houghton Mifflin); and Dayton Duncan's lively travelogue ''Out West: American Journey Along the Lewis and Clark Trail'' (Penguin). Besides our trusty Rand McNally, we found the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail map, with 80 points of interest, indispensable. It is available at the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, 1709 Jackson Street, Omaha, Neb. 68102; (402) 221-3478.</p>
