        <p>As president of the 1,450-member American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (Asaps), the leading organization of surgeons who specialize in cosmetic surgery and who are certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, I want to commend Anne Jarrell for her article ''Doctors Who Love Publicity.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As president of the 1,450-member American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (Asaps), the leading organization of surgeons who specialize in cosmetic surgery and who are certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, I want to commend Anne Jarrell for her article ''Doctors Who Love Publicity.''</p>
        <p>The Asaps Code of Ethics states clearly that no member shall give anything of value to a representative of the media in anticipation of or in return for professional publicity unless the fact of compensation is made known in such publicity.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, people interpret the mention of a physician in the media as an endorsement, and the media often lead readers/viewers to conclude that these procedures are safe no matter who is wielding the instrument.</p>
        <p>Prospective patients should check credentials, making sure that their doctors have the training for the procedure they are considering and that any facility in which surgery is performed is accredited.</p>
