        <p>JOSEPHINE BOJNOWSKI, 83, surveys her small but cheerful apartment at Lockwood Lodge, an assisted living center associated with Ashlar of Newtown, and smiles at the place she has called home for the past year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bojnowski, a former teacher and reading supervisor for the Newington school system, lived alone in a single-family house after her husband died but she could no longer manage after breaking her leg.  ''There were too many stairs,'' she said. ''I needed a place that served food and provided assistance.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bojnowski reflects a growing number of elderly Americans who need help with some of the activities of daily living but otherwise want to retain their independence.</p>
        <p>Assisted living is the fastest growing residential alternative for elderly people with incomes high enough to support the monthly fees, averaging $2,500 or more, since Medicare does not cover assisted-living expenses.</p>
        <p>Assisted living is defined as a living arrangement in which residents buy or rent their own apartment, where they live independently with medical and housekeeping assistance. They receive three meals a day in a common dining room and share many common areas with other residents. There also is a nurse on call 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>The adoption of assisted living regulations by the Connecticut Legislature in November 1994 paved the way for growth, according to industry officials. Since the regulations were adopted, 70 assisted-living service centers have been licensed in the state.</p>
        <p>Colonel John Kulp, 86, who retired from the United States Army, chose Lockwood Lodge because of its attractive ambience, services and proximity to his daughter in Redding.</p>
        <p>''It's bigger than Thoreau's cabin at Walden Pond,'' he said about his one-bedroom apartment. ''I would rather be climbing the Alps, or out running around, but I decided to move here when I began to have trouble with my vision. I need someone to look out for me as I get more absent-minded.''</p>
        <p>With the explosion of new centers, many still under construction, have come vacancies, particularly at some of the older complexes and at those with studio apartments. No longer is a waiting list the rule at most centers. This is due in part to the newness of the industry in Connecticut and a lack of awareness about it by the consumer, industry officials said.</p>
        <p>But Chris Carter, the executive director of the Connecticut Assisted Living Association, disputes the notion that assisted-living centers in the state are overbuilt. CALA was founded in June 1995 and offers education, training and information to raise the level of awareness about assisted living, in addition to fostering ethical standards and serving as a legislative ally.</p>
        <p>''Connecticut has 175,000 residents over the age of 75,'' he said. ''It's our belief that 50,000 of these individuals need assistance with daily living, of which 20,000 have an annual income of more than $25,000, making them eligible for assisted living.</p>
        <p>''Connecticut has 70 assisted living sites with a total of 4,000 units,'' he continued. ''The market is not overbuilt. With education, all the units will find themselves in demand.''</p>
        <p>The Greens at Canondale in Wilton opened two years ago and has full occupancy. Its monthly fees range from $3,750 to $5,850. A certain number of units are designated for people with lower incomes.</p>
        <p>''We have residents who have been here since we opened,'' said Sandra Sajec, executive director at the Greens. ''This is their home. We haven't lost too many.''</p>
        <p>By and large, residents must foot the bill for assisted living without Medicare reimbursement. But long-term care insurance is a growing commodity, offered by private insurers such as General Electric, John Hancock and Travelers. Some companies are even offering long-term care insurance for their employees' parents, according to Tim Hodges, vice president of marketing for Kensington Green of Southbury.</p>
        <p>Kensington Green is a 120-unit facility that will emphasize a healthy life style, focusing on diet, exercise and social relationships. It will have 24 separate apartments for people living with Alzheimer's disease. The facility is scheduled to open in March 2001.</p>
        <p>''We did a market feasibility study to find out the demand and determined it was there,'' Mr. Hodges said.</p>
        <p>The average age of assisted living residents is 84-85, and their average stay is two years, according to Mr. Carter. He said residents either die or require greater care at a nursing home.</p>
        <p>Ginny Carroll, the Lockwood Lodge marketing director, said there is an industry-wide problem of people waiting until they are physically incapacitated before looking into assisted living, which is geared to people who enjoy relatively good health.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to get people to think about assisted living before a crisis occurs,'' said Tony Copeland, a spokesman for the AARP, ''so they can take the time they need to find a facility, research it and make sure it meets their needs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carroll also mentioned an unanticipated phenomenon.</p>
        <p>''We're finding the demand to be different than we expected,'' she said. ''Through our studies, we expected more people to want studio apartments, due to the economics. We're finding people don't want to give up their space. They want to bring their memories. One-bedroom apartments are much more popular than studios.''</p>
        <p>Mark Ryan, secretary of the state for the Office of Policy and Management, said the state has been studying assisted living with interest, in an effort to deal with an aging population whose ranks are expected to surge over the next 30 years with the graying of the baby boomers.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Ryan, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages of elderly residents in the nation.</p>
        <p>The statistics are dramatic, with 34 million Americans 65 or older, up from 20 million in 1970, and the numbers are expected to swell to 70 million by 2030, according to AARP statistics.</p>
        <p>The number of elderly residents in Connecticut is proportionately higher. Nationwide, the percentage of people 65 or over is 12 percent, compared with 14.3 percent in Connecticut, according to 1990 state and federal census reports. By 2030, 20 percent of the national population will be over 65 and Mr. Ryan said Connecticut's population is expected to be elderly about 10 years sooner.</p>
        <p>''We're making major investments in assisted living,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We believe there is a good chunk of people in nursing homes who are poor but could manage well with assisted living, while improving their independence, respect and dignity.''</p>
        <p>The Office of Policy and Management and other state agencies are planning a pilot program with 300 assisted-living beds in five or six urban and lower-middle-class suburban communities for people living on Medicaid. A bill is pending in the state legislature that would allow assisted living to be layered into existing congregate care housing for the elderly, based on the belief it will provide a less costly and more desirable alternative to nursing homes for low-income elderly residents, according to Mr. Ryan. If the bill passes, some or all of the costs could be covered by Medicare.</p>
        <p>Martha Meng, a lawyer with Murtha, Cullina LLP of Hartford and New Haven, was part of a working group convened in 1991 by the Department of Health to write regulations for assisted living. The group completed the task in November 1994.</p>
        <p>''The assisted-living services agency is the licensed entity and must provide services within a managed residential agency that is registered with the state but is not itself licensed,'' she said. ''The managed residential agency is the platform, or physical plant for the services that must be provided to qualify as assisted living.''</p>
        <p>Services include three meals a day, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, access to health care, 24-hour security and staff availability, an emergency call system, medication management, social and recreational activities; and assistance, as needed, with eating, bathing, dressing, and mobility.</p>
        <p>Assisted living is as popular with baby boom children as it is with their older parents.</p>
        <p>Diane Mauriello of Newtown and her husband have school-age children living at home and they also have primary responsibility for their aging parents. Ms. Mauriello's father-in-law had a stroke last year and had to move to a nursing home in Southbury. Her mother-in-law, Cara Mauriello, 82, is frail, but not incapacitated. Although she does not need a nursing home, she can no longer live alone.</p>
        <p>''She was depressed and was not eating,'' Ms. Mauriello said of her mother-in-law. ''She didn't like living alone and needed companionship.''</p>
        <p>Since moving to Lockwood Lodge, she has blossomed, Ms. Mauriello said. ''She looks good, is well cared for 24 hours a day and never lonely. My husband and I were able to go on a cruise and leave her. We wouldn't have been able to do that before.''</p>
        <p>Darlene O'Connor, director of integrated care for the Connecticut Department of Social Services, offered the following advice for anyone considering assisted living for themselves or a loved one: ''Make sure you know what you are purchasing now and down the road, when you need more support. What conditions can the facility handle? What happens when your assets are gone?''</p>
