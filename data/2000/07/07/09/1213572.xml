        <p>THRONGS of drivers, including some never before behind the wheel, are lining up here to test three new cars that arrived late last month amid a promotional blitz comparable to a new-product introduction by Detroit.</p>

        <p>THRONGS of drivers, including some never before behind the wheel, are lining up here to test three new cars that arrived late last month amid a promotional blitz comparable to a new-product introduction by Detroit.</p>
        <p>These vehicles, unavailable in dealer showrooms, do come with a price: the $41 cost of admission to the Magic Kingdom at Disneyland. The fresh body styles are replacing what might be called a classic, a vaguely Ferrari-like roadster that puttered around the ''freeways'' of the Autopia attraction unchanged for 30 years.</p>
        <p>The three new models -- one is like a mini-S.U.V., another vaguely resembles a Volkswagen Beetle and the third is a Euro-styled sports car -- are part of a remake of the Tomorrowland attraction, sponsored for the first time by Chevron, the oil company, which joins a long list of corporate sponsors at Disneyland. For Chevron, the Autopia alliance was a natural extension of its own marketing efforts; its television ads feature animated talking cars.</p>
        <p>With freeway driving no longer a novelty, especially in Southern California, Autopia is now intended as a ride through an automotive fantasy world; statues in the ''park'' are representations of historic autos.</p>
        <p>The fanciful body styles of the new cars are supposed to convey distinct personalities, said Chevron's manager of brand strategy, Glenn R. Weckerlin. ''They are unique and Disneyesque, not ones you'd necessarily see on the road.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the two-seaters posed some design challenges. Besides size constraints for the seat and headrest, the shell had to fit over the old car's chassis, whose design had been perfected over 13 years of trial and error. ''We finally figured out how to build an Autopia car to last forever,'' said Bob Gurr, the original designer. ''We didn't want to mess with it.''</p>
        <p>Since the cars accommodate both children and adults, the designer of the new models, Jason Hulst, had to wrestle with proportions to get the right sense of scale. ''It's hard to make a car look good when a child is in it,'' Mr. Gurr said. Just as real-world car design is intended to convey a buyer's personality, the Autopia cars are also less serious and more image-conscious.</p>
        <p>Although Disneyland is an icon of American culture, Detroit is not about to mimic these designs, said Gaylord F. Eckles, an industrial design instructor at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. And he had a suggestion of his own: ''If Disney can do animatronic figures, why not have the cars really animated with moving lips?''</p>
        <p>He did like the color-shifting paint of the sports car, a special effect first used in 1996 on a limited-edition Ford Mustang Cobra.</p>
