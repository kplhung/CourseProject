        <p>''My boyfriend just wants sex,'' ''The Naked Truth,'' and ''Oral sex.'' And underneath: ''Talk about it.''</p>
        <p>These and similar messages have sprung up in recent months on billboards along South Africa's main highways, on trains, near schools and in cities and rural areas as part of a campaign to encourage young people to talk freely about sex and the risks of teenage pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
        <p>The erotic and hard-hitting phrases are part of a down-to-earth campaign aimed at reducing by one-half the rate of infection from H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in South Africa in five years.</p>
        <p>The 4.2 million H.I.V.-infected people in South Africa represent the largest such group in the world.</p>
        <p>More than one-third of pregnant women in some countries in Africa are H.I.V.-infected, and the rates are nearly as high among students in some universities.</p>
        <p>The messages tackle once-taboo subjects like masturbation, orgasms, foreplay and homosexuality as part of a campaign known as Love Life.</p>
        <p>Love Life's spokeswoman, Judi Nwokedi, described her organization's campaign as the boldest sex education campaign ever conducted in South Africa at a news conference sponsored by the American Medical Association today, the eve of the 13th International Conference on AIDS, which will be held here.</p>
        <p>The messages are also delivered on radio, television and in supplements in the nation's newspapers through funding from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation of Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
        <p>In addition to a media blitz, volunteers for Love Life visit sports facilities at schools and in communities to provide information to young South Africans.</p>
        <p>The campaign considers its main audience to be people ages 12 to 17. But Love Life also produces and sponsors a television series that encourages children 6 years old and older to talk to adults about things like sex.</p>
        <p>The organization also runs the Love Train, which travels the country's rails displaying South Africa's largest billboard. At various train stops, crowds write messages and graffiti on the cars.</p>
        <p>The train arrives in Durban today for the AIDS meeting.</p>
        <p>Love Life also uses the train to educate groups of schoolchildren about sex and AIDS.</p>
        <p>After listening to youths complain that existing public health campaigns were too negative, Love Life spent two years developing its campaign to change perceptions and behavior that increase risk for pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and AIDS.</p>
        <p>''Disease-driven and negative campaigns tend to ignore sexual desire and sex as a part of daily life,'' Ms. Nwokedi said.</p>
        <p>The program began last September with a larger aim than just giving information. Ms. Nwokedi said her group wanted ''a positive thrust, vibrancy, excellent marketing and boldness to get to the core of sexual issues.''</p>
        <p>Today's youth are image conscious, Ms. Nwokedi said. They also have more choices, and Love Life hopes to foster positive self-images and responsibility among the young people of South Africa, she said.</p>
