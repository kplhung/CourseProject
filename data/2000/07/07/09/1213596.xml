        <p>BRIDGE games. Elvis Presley. Iranian hostages.</p>
        <p>Those are some of the topics on the mind of H. Rodgin Cohen, a leading banking lawyer who on July 1 became chairman of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the New York law firm. For more than 30 years, Mr. Cohen, 56, has been a sought-after counselor to chief executives of the industry's largest institutions, including the Bank of New York, First Union and Societe Generale, advising on 10 of the 15 largest bank mergers in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Along with his reputation as an expert in banking arcana (he once wrote an article titled ''Interstate Banking: Myth and Reality''), he is a man of eclectic personal tastes. How many other lawyers can boast of spending weeknights as a high school student at the home of his chemistry teacher perfecting his bridge game? And few, to be sure, can rattle off the answer to almost any question about 1950's rock 'n' roll.</p>
        <p>Such interests give him an added dimension. But it is his skill as an attentive counselor who not only understands the law, but also how it is best applied in both business and politics, that holds sway with clients.</p>
        <p>Consider the 1993 acquisition of the Dreyfus Corporation, a mutual fund company, by the Mellon Financial Corporation. Martin G. McGuinn, chief executive of Mellon, said executives were worried that regulators would not allow the bank to buy a fund company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen came up with a structural solution that allowed the deal to be reviewed by the Comptroller of the Currency, instead of the Federal Reserve Board, which was expected to be less flexible, Mr. McGuinn said. It was approved.</p>
        <p>Tony Terracciano, who retired as president of First Union in 1997 and spent more than three decades at banks like Chase Manhattan and Mellon, described Mr. Cohen this way: ''I used to call him my legal St. Christopher medal,'' referring to the patron saint of travelers. Mr. Cohen is best in a crisis, able to synthesize information quickly and come up with a reasoned response, Mr. Terracciano said.</p>
        <p>Once, he said, he reached Mr. Cohen in a Manhattan cab by cell phone and asked a complex question. By the time Mr. Cohen reached his destination, he had consulted with an associate and then given Mr. Terracciano the answer.</p>
        <p>In late 1980, Mr. Cohen handled one of his most complex matters as part of a team representing several banks in the exchange of billions of dollars' worth of frozen Iranian assets for American hostages held in Iran. The lawyers met in Midtown Manhattan for weeks to overcome the practical and legal obstacles of such an exchange. ''It made you feel like you had a purpose in life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now, as Sullivan's new chairman, he faces a new set of challenges. To help stem the flow of young lawyers seduced by dot-com riches, Mr. Cohen has weekly lunches with handfuls of associates. The firm has also hired a consultant who interviews law school students about why they are, or are not, interested in joining the firm.  ''You don't panic over someone going out to make $10 million by age 30,'' he said. ''You can't compete with that. What you are trying to deal with is people on the margin.''</p>
        <p>Sullivan, which has 525 lawyers, is also responding to the trends of globalization and technology. Like many other New York-centered law firms, it is opening a Silicon Valley branch. The firm has also recently expanded its offices in Europe.</p>
        <p>With clients like Disney, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell remains one of the most profitable firms in the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen has spent nearly his whole career there. He was born in Charleston, W. Va., in 1944, the elder of two brothers and the son of a pharmacist who owned a small chain of drugstores. He did not stay long. His parents sent him to Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts for preparatory school, which is where he learned to play bridge. In the early 1960's, he headed to Harvard University, where he studied history and, in 1968, graduated from the law school.</p>
        <p>He had not planned on becoming a lawyer, he said, but chose law school to continue his liberal arts education. In fact, he had considered becoming a disc jockey or a veterinarian, but neither career seemed promising. He once flirted with the idea of writing, pitching a story idea to an editor friend at The New Yorker in the early 1970's. Her response was polite but blunt, he said: ''Stick to law.''</p>
        <p>That he did. He worked two years as an Army staff lawyer at Fort Monmouth, N.J., trying to disqualify military contractors that failed to deliver on orders. Then, in 1970, he joined Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</p>
        <p>He was asked to join the firm's banking practice, which then lacked glamour. Mr. Cohen changed all that. He has long represented the New York Clearing House Association of major New York banks, making him a weekly visitor to legislators and regulators in Washington.</p>
        <p>More recently, he has been a top adviser in the industry's consolidation wave, including the mergers of Chemical and Chase Manhattan, Wells Fargo and Norwest, and First Union and Corestates. Mr. Cohen's prowess is not unrivaled, however. He is often across the table from Edward Herlihy of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz,  who is also a well-regarded banking lawyer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen still expects to spend most of his time with his clients, devoting about 25 percent of his long day to managing the firm. That leaves him only limited time with his family. He has been married to his wife, Barbara, a former newspaper reporter, since 1969; they have a teenage daughter and a young son.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen joked that his constituents closest to home were often the hardest to please. Neither of his children, he said, really understands all the fuss over 1950's music. ''They don't think it's that sophisticated,'' he said. Folk singers get a lot more air time in his house these days, except when the kids are gone. ''Then I get on the treadmill and turn up the jukebox,'' he said.</p>
