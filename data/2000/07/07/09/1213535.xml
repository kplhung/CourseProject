        <p>Truth, Justice and the Commercial Way</p>
        <p>Supershilling superheroes are being tapped to sell everything from fashion clothes to French fizzy water. A vintage black-and-white shot of Superman is part of a television montage ad for Tommy Hilfiger Men -- but don't blink, it goes by faster than a speeding bullet. A live-action Batman (played by Bruce Thomas, not Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Adam West) appears in a series of television commercials for OnStar, a car dashboard computer system. Catwoman would have been a natural choice; instead, cartoon versions of Batman and Superman appear with white milk mustaches in recent print ads for the popular ''Got milk?'' campaign. Neither, though, is as refreshing (or as ubiquitous) as ads of the Human Torch reaching off a man's T-shirt toward a bottle of Perrier. This member of the Fantastic Four appears on bus shelters across town and as giveaway Max Racks postcard/stickers.</p>
