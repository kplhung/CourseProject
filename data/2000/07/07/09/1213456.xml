        <p>LAST Tuesday, as thousands of Westchester residents headed south to watch Operation Sail 2000, John P. Banning Jr. drove north to Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banning had a duty to perform here. For a span of 118 years, Mr. Banning and his father and his grandfather have been reciting the Declaration of Independence on the Fourth of July on the village green in front of St. Paul's Church National Historic Site.</p>
        <p>Even in years when the town did not put on a ceremony, Mr. Banning said, his father would appear at the church, sometimes in a heavy rain, to read the Declaration.</p>
        <p>This year Mr. Banning, an art dealer who was born in Mount Vernon and now lives in Manhattan, stood on a flag-draped dais with the mayor and other town officials. He read from a tattered 1879 history book, which was passed on from his grandfather, who died in 1924. Scrawled on the book's back page was a note from his grandmother urging her son to continue the tradition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Banning, who is 61, has a 34-year-old son who is expected to continue the readings after he dies, he said.</p>
        <p>''It's what the Fourth of July is supposed to be about, not just fireworks,'' said Phyllis Kirshner, a school secretary who left Mount Vernon for Chappaqua three decades ago after her children were born. ''I'm glad my daughter saw it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Like a number of other former Mount Vernon residents gathered here last Tuesday, Ms. Kirshner returns every year for the town's traditional ceremony, complete with a flag presentation by veterans, speeches and a band playing anthems and Sousa marches.</p>
        <p>''We have a cast of faithfuls,'' said Leslie Alpert, co-chairwoman of the town's Independence Day committee. ''Their allegiance is here in Mount Vernon.''</p>
        <p>About 250 people attended the ceremony on the tree-shaded village green, many of them elderly.</p>
        <p>Sitting on folding chairs in front of the stone church, which was completed in 1787, it was easy to feel a part of history.</p>
        <p>John Wright, a resident dressed in a tricorn hat and breeches -- the authentic dress of a Continental Army sergeant, he explained -- added to the illusion.</p>
        <p>After the Star Spangled Banner had been sung, a group of veterans, police officers and firefighters marched onto the green to present their flags and a wreath.</p>
        <p>''It's beyond Norman Rockwell,''  Mr. Banning said, gazing admiringly at the procession.</p>
        <p>Then came the speeches. Dr. Larry H. Spruill, the Mount Vernon city historian, gave the keynote address. In a booming, oratorical style, he reminded his listeners of Mount Vernon's importance in the Colonial period.</p>
        <p>In the Revolutionary War, Mount Vernon -- then part of the town of Eastchester -- was the northern limit of British control. The church was used as a British army hospital.</p>
        <p>''Before there was an Atlanta there was a town of Eastchester,''  Mr. Spruill said. ''Before Phoenix and Salt Lake City, we were here.''</p>
