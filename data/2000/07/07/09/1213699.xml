        <p>Garbage Disposals' Hum Added to City Sounds</p>

        <p>Keep fingers and spoons clear and the water running, hit the switch and listen to the sweet rumbling of peelings, cores and antiquated leftovers swirling down the drain.

        <p>Garbage Disposals' Hum Added to City Sounds</p>
        <p>Slowly but surely, the grinding whir of garbage disposals is joining the symphonic, electronic noise of New York City's kitchens.</p>
        <p>Keep fingers and spoons clear and the water running, hit the switch and listen to the sweet rumbling of peelings, cores and antiquated leftovers swirling down the drain. It's a daily ritual for people in 80 to 90 percent of the custom kitchens in the Southeast, Midwest and West, and just over half the custom kitchens in the Northeast, according to the National Kitchen and Bath Association.</p>
        <p>But until 1997, when the City Council lifted its 26-year ban on garbage disposals, the kitchen-sink route to oblivion was not an option for most of New York City.</p>
        <p>In the last several years, disposal sales have been brisk but uneven. ''Contractors as well as homeowners are catching on, but it's a slow process, because people are not that familiar with them so much,'' said Joe Jones, an assistant manager with Davis &amp; Warshow Inc., a plumbing supply company. He estimates that his store, at 701 Seventh Avenue, sells several a week. ''It hasn't hit like wildfire yet.''</p>
        <p>He said he suspected that people were not yet using their disposals, which sell for $150 to $300, to their full potential. ''It takes time to get used to throwing your food down the sink as opposed to in a waste receptacle,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Scott, sales manager for the newly offered Chelsea Mercantile condominiums at Seventh Avenue and 24th Street, said the developer's decision to include garbage disposals in the building's renovated kitchens made her job easier. ''I have one personally,'' she said. ''If you're cooking, peeling, or cleaning plates, you just don't accumulate as much garbage.'' And less garbage means less odor and less vermin, she added.</p>
        <p>Racial Arithmetic And Long Division</p>
        <p>The latest skirmish in the 15-year legal battle over desegregation in Englewood, N.J., took place recently in the state's second-highest court, the Appellate Division of Superior Court.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the Englewood Board of Education had asked the Department of Education to merge with Tenafly and Englewood Cliffs in the mid-1980's. Englewood now argues that almost 100 percent of the students at Englewood's Dwight Morrow High School are black or Hispanic; that almost 100 percent of those at Tenafly High School, 2.4 miles away, are white or Asian; and that white students in Englewood Cliffs who would be assigned to Dwight Morrow avoid going there by attending private schools.</p>
        <p>These circumstances ''amount to a fundamental violation of New Jersey's constitutional principles and precedents'' and only mandatory regionalization -- combining the districts -- has a reasonable chance of success, according to court papers filed by Englewood. It accuses the State Education Department, which refused to order a  desegregation in 1997, of acting arbitrarily.</p>
        <p>James Rothschild, a lawyer for the Tenafly Board of Education, argued against regionalization.</p>
        <p>''We pointed out that the state board had before it a 35-year history that voluntary magnet school type of remedies work, and that involuntary court orders did not work,'' he said. Mandatory desegregation in Plainfield and Englewood elementary schools in the 1960's did not work well, he argued, but Montclair, which created magnet schools, had achieved a racial balance. ''Tenafly is doing very well,'' he said, adding that combining it would be a mistake.</p>
        <p>The appeal was heard on May 9.</p>
