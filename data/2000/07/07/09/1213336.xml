        <p>THE composers, visionaries, theorists, tinkerers and crackpots who invented electronic music were making it, at first, largely for themselves. Working as a research-and-development corps at a peculiar intersection of science and aesthetics, they spun off a few practical applications, like sound effects for movies and funny noises for commercials. But they did their more serious work for those few listeners who'd go to concerts where the only thing to look at was a loudspeaker.</p>
        <p>They probably never imagined that by the end of the 20th century, thousands of people would regularly turn out to hear electronic music in special environments, through sound systems specifically designed for it. Those places are called clubs, and electronic music lives in them quite comfortably.</p>
        <p>It's a long way from the labs of electronic music's pioneers. But as soon as sound-shaping technology approached the threshold of convenience, popular music took the paradigms of electronic composition and ran with them. Sounds and strategems that once seemed impossibly futuristic -- atonality, synthetic timbres, superhuman agility, jump-cut juxtapositions -- are now taken for granted by anyone who tunes in a Top 40 radio station.</p>
        <p>While the bulk of electronic popular music aims for dance-floor functionality, there's no scarcity of musicians concocting sound for sound's sake. It might be the razzle-dazzle, hands-on vinyl manipulation of turntablists like the X-ecutioners (who perform on Saturday as part of the Lincoln Center Festival's Electronic Evolution series) or the shape-shifting, hyperlinked soundscapes created by the three disk jockeys in We (which performs Saturday at Creative Time's ''Remix'' series at the Anchorage under the Brooklyn Bridge) or the quiet, slithery, ominous ambient music of Micro  storia or the giddy, haywire-robot antics of Autechre. Distinguished composers in universities and government-sponsored institutions have now been surrounded, and often outmatched, by geeks with laptops and disk jockeys applying quick hands to eclectic collections.</p>
        <p>There was no sudden turnaround, no revolution. Instead, electronic noises and their implications spread by osmosis. Musicians discovered new toys, manufacturers kept updating their gadgets and producers devised tactics to harness them. Before long, listeners took for granted the electronic timbres that once seemed unearthly. Now, oscillators and microchips serenade us day and night, from touch-tone phones to cash machines to car alarms. Popular music, awash in electronic tones and digital control, merely reflects everyday reality.</p>
        <p>In some ways, rock and electronic music were always fellow travelers. As documented on the ''Ohm'' boxed set, a survey of early electronic composers, electronic music surged in the 1950's alongside rock 'n' roll, after decades of sporadic activity including the invention of electronic instruments like the theremin. Rock, like electronic music, relied on instruments that plugged in. And in reaching for a radio audience and hit records, rock quickly grew used to being disembodied. What counted, increasingly, was what jumped out of the speakers. It didn't take rock producers long to realize that recordings didn't have to be souvenirs of performances; they could be tweaked, spliced, gimmicked, overdubbed. They could be, in a word, unnatural, as unnatural as the artificial tones of electronic music.</p>
        <p>Explicitly or not, rockers came around to the same ways of thinking that electronic composers were using. They started to hear music as signals and processing, as textures distributed over time. Electronic sounds weren't so alien to rock musicians; anyone who has plugged an instrument into an amplifier has heard the harsh beauty of electricity going astray, and rockers soon came to love distortion and feedback. Still, it would take Jimi Hendrix to completely reimagine the electric guitar as a source of pure electronic signals: controlled or chaotic, abstract or as visceral as the blues.</p>
        <p>Les Paul, toying with multitrack tape and speed manipulation, unleashed the possibilities not just of improving music in the mix, but of treating every sound, regardless of its origins, as a variable that could be manipulated. Whether or not producers were aware of Pierre Schaeffer's late-1940's work with noises on bits of tape, multitrack recording and ever-improving studio equipment made every song a potential exercise in musique concrete, turning recorded sound into something never heard in real time. (It was an insight music producers shared with the pragmatic collagists who made radio advertisements, splicing and echoing their way to maximum impact or annoyance.)</p>
        <p>While rock and rollers were using tape trickery for novelties -- early pop sampling, for instance, in Dickie Goodman's ''flying saucer'' comedy singles, with a deadpan interviewer answered by snippets of current hits -- academic composers and eccentric souls were devising all sorts of precedents. ''Ohm'' shows them coming up with, and then leaving by the wayside, techniques of cutting, mixing, sampling, looping, layering and sequencing that would soon become commonplace in rock.</p>
        <p>Rockers followed paths that more solemn electronic composers puritanically disdained. They liked tonal harmony as much as they liked abstract noise and saw no sin in combining the two. They didn't consider a steady beat, even a simple 4/4 beat, to be automatically trivial. They were also happy to let machines be mechanical: that is, to repeat tasks like any other piece of automation. First with short patterns -- melodies, rhythms, samples -- and then with longer and longer ones as machine memories improved, they built old-fashioned song forms or harnessed the hypnotic power of repetition. (Of course, repetition can also be abused. Far too many electronica albums, whether they're uptempo dance music or ''hearts of space'' ambient music, end up more numbing than incantatory.)</p>
        <p>Self-consciously artistic rock musicians, like Frank Zappa and the Beatles, picked up ideas from the electronic avant-garde in the psychedelic 1960's, and they put in long studio hours to come up with determinedly avant efforts like the Beatles'  ''Revolution No. 9.'' Others waited until synthetic sounds were available, thanks to inventors like Robert Moog, at the touch of a familiar-looking keyboard. By the early 1970's, rock had its own avant theorist in the person of Brian Eno, who combined some of the aleatoric and all-sound-can-be-music thinking of John Cage with the lessons of 20th-century visual artists and his own healthy intuitions.</p>
        <p>''Machine Soul: An Odyssey Into Electronic Dance Music,'' a two-CD set compiled by Rhino Records, shows how musical ideas and updated gizmos have leapfrogged each other since 1977, when Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder unveiled ''I Feel Love.'' It's a shame the set doesn't go back two more decades, when synthesizers and sequencers (the electronic equivalents of player-piano rolls) had already escaped ivy towers and recording studios to provide swoops, drones, blips and pulsations for various pop projects. By deliberately limiting itself to dance music, the set also avoids the thickets and tangents of electronic music that's not so singleminded: ambient, illbient, trip-hop, minimal techno, psychedelic trance, improvisation and other left-field subgenres. But ''Machine Soul'' shows how fast electronic timbres and metronomic drum patterns infiltrated pop. At first, synthetic sounds are treated as alien and impersonal; they lead to lyrics about outer space and robots. But by the early 1980's, musicians and listeners both hear electronic sounds as just another tone color. (Around the same time, another electronic marvel was being domesticated: PC's were beginning to appear on desktops.)</p>
        <p>On ''Machine Soul,'' the old synthesizers have the out-of-tune jolt of barely controlled analog equipment. The tones are at once corny and defiant, crude like a beginning guitarist, until reverb and digital synthesis smooth them out. Yet electronic popular music keeps going back to the jolt: in hip-hop drumbeats sampled from scratchy LP's, in bursts of static or distortion, in whole pieces -- by the likes of Pan Sonic -- made from the sounds of malfunctioning equipment. Technology, even as it multiplies possibilities, can't clean up rock's vandalistic impulses.</p>
        <p>Rock brought something even more valuable to the electronic sphere: it removed the hermetic aspect of the music. Although there were some improvising musicians (notably Musica Elettronica Viva) among the electronic pioneers, most of the music was finished in the recording studio, to be quietly appreciated during playback. Rock (and dance music and hip-hop) pushed the music into a public role by taking it to the party. To rock ears, the music invites participation. In a club, the inhuman electronic beat is completed by a dancing body, and the arty electronic abstraction becomes the atmosphere of a chill-out room.</p>
        <p>When rock annexed electronic music from its pioneers, in some ways it reinvented the wheel. But by hurling the music into the mass media and into the marketplace, it rolled that wheel into a whole new arena, where strange, improbable combinations are being hooked up right now.</p>
