        <p>SPEAKING to several hundred students in the high school auditorium here, Eric, 23, could have passed for a senior himself. Except he was wearing a tan prison uniform and is serving seven years in the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility for vehicular homicide.</p>
        <p>''I never thought it would happen to me, but here I am,'' said Eric, who became an alcoholic in college and killed two friends while driving drunk. ''It's not too late for you.''</p>
        <p>He and three other inmates -- who gave their first names only -- addressed students last month under Project Pride (Promoting Responsibility in Drug Education), a Department of Corrections program that sends inmates into schools to explain how drugs and alcohol led them to prison.</p>
        <p>Since September 1998, about 35,000 students at 165 schools have heard the message, said Christine Laquidara, director of educational services for corrections. By contrast, Scared Straight sessions, in existence since 1976, have dwindled to three in the last six months. Ms. Laquidara said 15 more had been approved.</p>
        <p>Lateesha Askew, a 19-year-old senior, was one of about a half-dozen students who said she preferred a less-intimidating approach than Scared Straight.</p>
        <p>''To get to somebody, I don't think you have to scream and holler,'' Lateesha said. ''I think just talking and working everything out will work the best.''</p>
        <p>Jason, a 25-year-old inmate serving 10 years for armed robbery, said Scared Straight had not helped him when he went through at age 13. ''They were old guys; I was a young kid,'' Jason said. ''I didn't relate, but hopefully the kids will relate to us.''</p>
        <p>But proponents of Scared Straight insist it has more of an effect.</p>
        <p>''Bringing the prisoners to the high school is not as frightening an experience as students going into a prison,'' said Kim Steiner-Out, co-chairwoman of the Lifers' Civilian Advisory Board. ''That's what prison is about.''</p>
        <p>And Mark Redguard, 35, a lawyer from East Orange who went through Scared Straight at age 15, said the experience remained ''embedded'' in memory.</p>
        <p>''I noticed the bars got shut and there was nothing but concrete and metal all around,'' Mr. Redguard said. ''I saw prisoners moving in handcuffs. I imagined what it would be like to be in here for good. People may not come to visit you. It's like you're absent from everybody's mind.''</p>
