        <p>For the last 12 years, George Washington High School's baseball team, the Trojans, has been consistently ranked among the best in the nation. It has produced dozens of minor- and major-league ballplayers, including Manny Ramirez, now an outfielder for the Cleveland Indians.</p>

        <p>For the last 12 years, George Washington High School's baseball team, the Trojans, has been consistently ranked among the best in the nation. It has produced dozens of minor- and major-league ballplayers, including Manny Ramirez, now an outfielder for the Cleveland Indians.</p>
        <p>In those same 12 years, the team has held batting practice on the school's field in Washington Heights only two or three times, said Steve Mandl, the school's athletic director and head baseball coach. The artificial turf is battered and torn, the backstop is small, and when batters hit homers, the balls often fly off the side of a cliff at the edge of the field.</p>
        <p>But the field is about to get a $2 million overhaul.</p>
        <p>Washington is one of dozens of city schools whose athletic fields, gymnasiums and swimming pools are to be renovated in the next few years with financial support from a new organization called Take the Field, a public-private partnership created to support struggling athletic programs in the city's public schools.</p>
        <p>To begin the effort, ground will be broken tomorrow for construction at Washington. The organization, in concert with the city, hopes to provide at least $17 million for capital improvements at high schools throughout the city.</p>
        <p>The group hopes to help those schools with the most pressing needs and the most committed sports programs -- schools that are making strides despite financial obstacles.</p>
        <p>The conditions at many schools were stunningly poor, said Richard A. Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly and a founder of the organization. ''I met with a captain of a girls' softball team in Beach Channel, Queens, which had one cracked helmet for the whole team,'' he said. ''The uniform she was wearing was seven years old and had been passed down from student to student each year. This was a pretty aggressive team and their uniforms got torn sometimes, so each student had sewed it up on their own.''</p>
        <p>So far, Take the Field has selected seven schools to receive financing this year: George Washington and Seward Park High School in Manhattan; William C. Bryant High School and Far Rockaway High School in Queens; South Bronx High School in the Bronx; Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn; and Port Richmond High School on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said school districts across the country were increasingly taking support from private donors who want to improve sports programs. ''Our public funds are able to go further with the help of the private groups that get involved,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ever since the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's, a shortage of money to maintain school sports facilities has led to widespread deterioration, making it all but impossible for many students to participate in teams or even basic recreation.</p>
        <p>That shortage of financing led to the formation of the program by its three founders: Mr. Kahan; Preston Robert Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corporation and part owner of the New York Giants; and Tony Kiser, president of the William and Mary Greve Foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tisch said the project was modeled after the Center for Arts Education. The nonprofit group has raised $23.1 million from the private and public sectors since 1996 to encourage the teaching of the arts, and is led by Mr. Tisch's daughter, Laurie Tisch Sussman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tisch said his daughter telephoned him after reading about the dearth of money for sports programs and said, ''Do you want to do for sports education what I've done for arts education?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tisch, Mr. Kahan and Mr. Kiser approached City Hall after joining forces at a meeting called by Rudy Crew, who was then schools chancellor. City officials were receptive. ''It seemed to us they were all very anxious to do something and were looking for a vehicle that could address the issues efficiently,'' Mr. Kahan said.</p>
        <p>Under the plan they worked out,  Take the Field would contribute $1 for every $3 the city gave. So far, the city has pledged $10.8 million, with another $3 million earmarked for the project over the next two years. Take the Field expects to raise an additional $3.6 million from private sources this year. The Tisch Foundation, the William and Mary Greve Foundation and the Hecksher Foundation for Children have already committed a total of $1.7 million.</p>
        <p>At Washington, Mr. Mandl said the renovation of the field would help not only the winning baseball team, but the soccer, football and track programs as well. ''I can't wait,'' he said. ''I'm hoping that they'll put light up around the new field, which will have natural grass instead of turf, and that'll be incredible.''</p>
