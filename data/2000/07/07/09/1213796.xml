        <p>The Mystified Magistrate</p>
        <p>And Other Tales.</p>
        <p>By the Marquis de Sade.</p>
        <p>Arcade, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Reading the Marquis de Sade requires stamina. Like his heroine, Justine, we must persevere through innumerable humiliations, rapes and beatings -- all told in slow-motion detail. Then de Sade invariably subjects us to long-winded and spirited defenses of the vices he's just described. His inexhaustible imagination never flags, nor does he ever cease to delight in demolishing modesty and decency at every turn. Thus the tameness of this collection -- which is made up of stories that are being published in English for the first time, in a limber translation by Richard Seaver -- comes as a surprise. Sade serves up a colorful buffet in this novella and 12 stories: an adulterous wife who favors gymnastic threesomes; Father Gabriel, a ''real stud,'' who gives the impression that ''the task of repopulating the entire earth could be left entirely in his capable hands''; and a priest who teaches the mystery of consubstantiality by having his young charges fornicate so they grasp how two can become one. Unlike de Sade's novels, these ribald tales are more apt to elicit a snicker than a shudder. Some even end on decidedly conventional notes. In one, a promiscuous lesbian, Augustine de Villeblanche, abandons her previous habits to become the ''most chaste and virtuous of wives.'' These short narratives sometimes offer half-hearted morals but for the most part they're merely diverting. An exception is the tiresome title novella. This satirical tale is Sade's revenge on the judges who kept him imprisoned for 27 years. It undoubtedly brought Sade satisfaction when he wrote it in the Bastille in 1787, but its wickedness quickly grows stale.</p>
