Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman grace boxes of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese. Barbie is dressing like Wonder Woman.

A Spiderman movie is spinning into production for a Thanksgiving 2001 release. And a half-dozen more secret-identities-and-groovy-gadgets flicks are in development. Whassup?

        <p>Getting Their Tights in a Twist</p>
        <p>Not since Batman and Robin swapped their long underwear for rubber fetish gear have superheroes gotten such a makeover. In ''X-Men,'' a live-action movie based on the enduring Stan Lee comics, the director Bryan Singer (''The Usual Suspects'') has traded the Marvel mutants' signature yellow-and-midnight-blue skintight costumes for retro-futuristic black leather uniforms. ''My fear,'' he said, ''was that if you went with a variety of colors, what exudes character on the comic page would look absurd on the big screen.'' The new uniforms, created by the costume designer Louise Mingenbach, hark to the X-Men's 1960's origins, Mr. Singer said, but are hip enough for ''Matrix'' audiences. In the film, the hirsute Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) spots the sleek leather outfit he's expected to wear and says, ''You actually go out in these things?'' All but rolling his eye, Cyclops (James Marsden) retorts, ''What would you prefer, yellow Spandex?''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the wheelchair-bound Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) has upped his style quotient, too. The leader of the X-Men wears Richard Tyler suits. But like his mutant followers, the clothes are a bit out of the ordinary. Mr. Stewart could not keep the suits after the movie.</p>
        <p>''They're tailored for someone sitting down,'' Mr. Singer explained.</p>
