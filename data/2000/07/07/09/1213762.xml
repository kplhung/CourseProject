        <p>The day began with Mets and Yankees fans cheering together for Dwight Gooden at Shea Stadium but culminated with the Mets' best player lying dazed on the ground of Yankee Stadium, his teammates shouting furiously at one Yankee in particular.</p>
        <p>This one-day, crosstown ride through history was supposed to be about MetroCards and the E-ZPass, but after Roger Clemens beaned Mike Piazza in the second inning last night, it become something ugly. For the first time, there is real anger in the inter league rivalry between the Yankees and the Mets.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch whacked a three-run homer that was nearly caught as the Yankees beat the Mets, 4-2, in the second game to sweep the day-night doubleheader. The final game will be played at Shea tonight, and the Yankees have a chance to take all four games in this series and extend a winning streak that has reached five.</p>
        <p>But the Mets are simmering. Piazza was found to have a concussion after having X-rays, will most likely not play tonight and may not be able to play in the All-Star Game on Tuesday, and some of the Mets -- notably Manager Bobby Valentine -- are convinced Clemens hit Piazza intentionally.</p>
        <p>''We've handed his lunch to him every time we've played him, so the first hitter he throws at his head, the third hitter he throws at his head, and the fourth hitter he hits him in the head,'' Valentine said. ''My player who had pretty good success against that pitcher got hit in the head.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said: ''I didn't hit Mike on purpose. I was going to pitch him inside. That was my game plan going in.''</p>
        <p>Valentine: ''I've seen him try to hit guys in the head before.''</p>
        <p>The hostility began with what might have been a misunderstanding in the very first inning. Clemens whipped a fastball past the Mets' Lenny Harris to open the game and received the ball back from catcher Chris Turner. Clemens turned his back toward the plate, and suddenly the umpires were asking for the ball, and it was thrown out of play.</p>
        <p>Many pitchers do not like it when hitters ask for a ball change in the middle of an at-bat, and Clemens may have thought that the Mets' leadoff hitter had done just that. In fact, the Hall of Fame had requested the baseball used with the game's first pitch, and the umpires had forgotten to retrieve it immediately. Regardless, Clemens fired his next pitch, a fastball, in the vicinity of Harris's head, the hitter ducking backward. To the Mets, it appeared to be an overt attempt to intimidate them.</p>
        <p>Piazza led off the second against Clemens. Both are destined for the Hall of Fame, but Piazza dominated Clemens in previous encounters: 7 hits in 12 at-bats, including three home runs. ''Everybody knows Mike's had success against me, obviously,'' Clemens said. ''I wanted to pitch him inside.''</p>
        <p>Clemens threw a fastball inside that Piazza watched -- strike one -- and threw another fastball, 92 miles an hour. Piazza realized the ball was coming at him and began ducking, but it hit him solidly on the helmet, just above the bill. He fell onto his back, eyes closed and then open, his expression blank.</p>
        <p>There was a rush from the Mets dugout, and as Piazza was being tended to, Valentine walked back and forth, glancing in the direction of Clemens. John Stearns, the Mets' bench coach, was more obvious, yelling and holding up two fingers: twice they thought Clemens aimed fastballs at their hitters. Clemens squatted in front of the mound, looking down. ''I was shaken after I hit him,'' he said. ''That was not the way I wanted to get him out.''</p>
        <p>Mike Hampton, who will pitch tonight for the Mets, said: ''If Mike doesn't duck, it hits him right between the eyes. That would be death. I think Roger is enough of a man to admit he made a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre defended Clemens, saying he has encouraged him to pitch inside. ''To hit somebody in the head -- we don't do that,'' Torre said. ''Why? Mike hadn't had a hit in the series, and we're not going to stir that up.''</p>
        <p>Piazza eventually rose, woozy, and walked off unsteadily, replaced by a pinch-runner. When play resumed, Valentine and the Mets' Derek Bell and perhaps others screamed profanities at Clemens. The Mets players stood at the railing at the front of the dugout, poised, just in case. Retaliation seemed inevitable.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez led off the bottom of the second against Glendon Rusch, and with his second pitch to Martinez, Rusch hit him on the backside with a fastball. Message sent. Martinez glanced at Rusch, flipped his bat away and jogged to first, while 55,821 roared.</p>
        <p>Doug Eddings, the plate umpire, warned both teams against further brushbacks. Valentine argued more, again making the point that Clemens had thrown two brushback pitches, while Rusch had hit one batter. Later, Clemens threw inside to Bell. ''Sounds like three for one to me,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>The Mets scored twice in the fifth on two-out singles by Bell and Edgardo Alfonzo. David Justice and Shane Spencer singled to open the bottom of the fifth, however, and advanced on Turner's bunt. Scott Brosius punched a single through the infield to score Justice, Spencer advancing to third.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch then smashed a liner toward left, where Harris -- a utilityman who plays many positions -- ran back toward the wall, jumped and reached up, Knoblauch's liner hitting in his glove, for an instant.</p>
        <p>But Harris's arm hit the top of the wall, and the ball fell on the other side of the fence, a three-run homer. ''All those ghosts in left field, maybe they pulled the ball out of my glove,'' he said. ''I thought I had it. Unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Clemens pitched into the eighth, throwing well, and Mariano Rivera recorded his second save of the day. There were no more incidents, which does not guarantee bad blood won't rise again today. ''I hope not,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Hampton said: ''I don't think it'll carry over. I won't initiate anything.''</p>
