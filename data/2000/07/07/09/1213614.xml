        <p>New York's summer nightmare begins on a steamy evening when a few million people suddenly switch on their air-conditioners, in effect blowing the fuse for a wired city. The dimming of lights on the Upper East Side last month was a reminder that it can happen, as it did last July when northern Manhattan suffered a 19-hour blackout. Consolidated Edison has said the city's newly fortified neighborhood power grids are ready for soaring temperatures and power use. Still, there are reasons to worry about how the nationwide experiment with utility deregulation will affect the reliability and cost of power in a city that thrives on electricity.</p>
        <p>Deregulation, which promised more competition, more alternative power sources and lower costs to consumers, appears to be playing transitional tricks in a few areas around the country, including New York City. As part of its restructuring in the last few years, Con Edison has been shedding power plants and moving steadily into the business of distributing power. That means Con Ed must now turn around and buy power to distribute, a cost that it then passes along to its customers.</p>
        <p>Energy prices this summer are rising for several reasons, including higher costs for the fuel used to generate power. The inevitable spike in temperatures will also bring a spike in demand for electricity. Then there is the city's booming economy, which encourages people to buy more gadgets and appliances -- which are simply plucked out of their boxes and plugged into the walls without advance notice to the utility. Under deregulation, competition from other power sources was supposed to provide price relief. But alternative power sources are not readily available for most city residents.</p>
        <p>New York's City Council will begin hearings next week on concerns that Con Ed's 2.8 million city customers could see energy costs go up 30 percent this summer, an increase Mayor Rudolph Giuliani labeled ''outrageous.'' The mayor has advised the company to cut into its sizable profits rather than raise rates. On a larger scale, the hearings should determine whether the new Con Ed has begun favoring its shareholders over its city customers.</p>
        <p>Most experts suggest that the power squeeze in the city will continue for several summers, until new plants are built or alternative power sources become available. Gov. George Pataki, the Legislature and the state's Public Service Commission should recognize that deregulation is still in its early stages and needs more oversight if such a daring experiment is to succeed in providing reliable, environmentally sound and affordable wattage, especially in an overheated New York City.</p>
