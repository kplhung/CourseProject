        <p>IF hotels can have astrological signs, then Mount Juliet must surely be a Gemini.</p>
        <p>Arrive through the main gate on the outskirts of Thomastown, County Kilkenny, and you're deep in Arcadia, driving through fields picturesquely dotted with sheep and catching glimpses, as the lane bends in and out of the woods, of an imposing Georgian manor house where you'll be encouraged to masquerade as a member of the Anglo-Irish gentry. Arrive through the rear gate, as my husband and I did after a day of backroads rambling on the way down from Dublin, and you might think you'd been transported to an upscale retirement colony in the Carolinas: the landscape is all glossy green golf course, punctuated by clusters of town houses and little placards advertising wonderful opportunities for the construction of lavish dream homes. You might as well be at Hilton Head.</p>
        <p>As the resolutely nonathletic wife of a golf-obsessed husband, I've come to accept the inevitable. To him, there's no such thing as too much golf. To me, a good golf course is one that allows me my own space, preferably enough to pretend I'm somewhere else entirely.</p>
        <p>So it wasn't until we rounded a hill and the golf course development dropped from view that my panic subsided. On one side of Mount Juliet's 1,500-acre estate, within the shelter of the great gray stone house and its gardens, I was safely deposited in a fantasy of 18th-century languor. Back there, just out of sight, were the heated swimming pool and the reflexology treatments, the sauna and the steam room, and the 18 holes of championship fairways, greens and sand traps designed by Jack Nicklaus. Still, I had the feeling that even after 20-plus years of marital travel negotiation (one Scottish golf outing equals two castle visits; two days of ruins in Evora pay off two tee times in the Algarve), Mount Juliet was going to provide an interesting lesson in compromise.</p>
        <p>The first compromise had already happened -- trading off the possibility of sun and mild weather for the certainty of serenity and lower prices. Arriving in Ireland at the end of March got us out into the countryside when the earliest spring flowers were in blossom and the yearly migration of tour buses had yet to begin in earnest. Although the weather wasn't exactly balmy, the blustery gray sky only made the yellow of the forsythia seem brighter, and the 50-ish temperatures encouraged both outdoor activity and restorative retreats to the nearest pub.</p>
        <p>Once settled behind a whiskey or a Guinness, we also had the cheering prospect of contemplating our own cleverness: Mount Juliet (which bills itself as ''Ireland's finest sporting estate'') offers a ''midweek break'' package all year, but from November through March, the rates are significantly lower. For $200 a person for two nights (at $1.21 to the punt), we had secured a vast room overlooking the grassy courtyard of the mansion, a full Irish breakfast both mornings (meaning that lunch was going to be pretty much optional) and an evening meal in the formal dining room, where the set-price menu normally costs $42 each.</p>
        <p>In summer, I suspect that the majority of visitors to Mount Juliet have American accents, but at this season our fellow guests were mostly Irish. There were enough of them so the place didn't feel like a haunted house -- but not so many that a peacefully proprietary feeling couldn't be indulged.</p>
        <p>Given our unpromising introduction, I found it remarkably easy to feel proprietary about Mount Juliet House. Laid out in a U-shape with immensely high ceilings and rooms that seem, even on a dark day, to be filled with light, it was built in the mid-18th century by the Earl of Carrick and named for his wife. Inhabited by generations of hunters and horse breeders, it's a stately old pile that manages to exude an unfussy sense of comfort.</p>
        <p>THERE'S some chintz and color-coordinated plaid in the bedrooms and a lot of well-aged furniture throughout, but, unlike some fancy country house hotels, Mount Juliet isn't accessorized to the hilt. In the almost aggressively decoration-free drawing room, the main attractions are a coal fire and a bay window that looks out across the gently sloping valley of the River Nore. In other words, Mount Juliet is a hotel utterly unlike the one we once stayed at in Wales, where the staff seemed always to be lurking in the next room, ready to rush in and plump up the cushions or tidy the still-life arrangement of the coffee table as soon as we removed ourselves from the sofa.</p>
        <p>Mount Juliet's relaxed style also held true in our private quarters, named for Lady Mary, a 16th-century granddaughter of the eighth Earl of Ormonde, whose descendants (like so many people in these parts) lost their land to a follower of Thomas Cromwell. Decorated in pale shades of salmon and teal blue, it had more than enough space for a huge bed, a pair of armchairs, a desk, a full-length tilting mirror, a couple of hefty chests (one hiding a television) and a low table with plates, linen napkins, knives and a bowl of fruit.  The bathroom was dim but spacious, equipped with a phone and a bidet, yet not as lavishly stocked with toiletries as one might expect.</p>
        <p>The only thing hanging on the wall in the bedroom was a charmingly bad poem celebrating the virtues of Mount Juliet in the season of our visit, when</p>
        <p>clumps of daffodils converge</p>
        <p>as old friends, nodding their heads and</p>
        <p>looking around like early arrivals at a party</p>
        <p>to celebrate the birth of spring.</p>
        <p>If I wanted to have a party here, I'd forget about the daffodil fields and book the serenely grand Lady Helen Dining Room, where dinner and breakfast are served and where elaborate plasterwork medallions festoon the pastel-colored walls and ceiling. But I'd also think about hiring a caterer, since the food on our visit wasn't quite up to the elegant surroundings.</p>
        <p>Breakfast -- cereal, croissants and pastries, fresh orange juice and the usual array of eggs, black and white puddings and sausages -- was first rate. But dinner, chosen from a menu of three appetizers, three main courses and three desserts, with coffee, was strangely uneven. The starters (leek and potato soup, smoked salmon, chicken Caesar salad) were predictable but quite good. And  the desserts (sticky toffee pudding, something called bread and butter pudding, various farmhouse cheeses) even better. Midway through the meal, however, we hit a rough patch: my roast pork was dry, and my husband's duck sat on top of a risotto that could have passed for scalliony oatmeal. Even odder, the chef had inserted black pudding into such unlikely items as dinner rolls and mashed potatoes. The wine list was extensive and expensive. (We respectfully noted the presence of a 1982 Chateau Mouton Rothschild at $2,180, and hurried along to one of the cheaper offerings, a $52 St.-Estephe.)</p>
        <p>Given all this, a thrifty midweek-package diner might want to decline paying extra for a second evening meal, especially since John and Sally McKenna's excellent ''Bridgestone Irish Food Guide'' includes tempting entries for nearby Graiguenama nagh and Kilkenny. We would have done just that if the lure of a long hot bath and a late-afternoon nap hadn't proved irresistible.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to another area of compromise: hanging around Mount Juliet versus exploring the surrounding countryside. In addition to golf, there is riding, shooting, fishing, even a cricket ground. But on the morning when my husband played his 18 holes, I chose a less strenuous option -- a leisurely walk along a riding trail that runs across the river to the Ballylinch Stud Farm, where Mount Juliet's most famous racehorse, the Tetrarch, is buried and where the lower pastures were almost bursting with mares and newborn foals.</p>
        <p>I'd intended to be out for just an hour or so, but the whole morning passed as I made my way along the fence rails. Wandering through the woods and out into the upper pastures, I came upon a collection of pregnant mares waiting out their time, eager for commiseration.</p>
        <p>Farther along, at the crest of a hill with a view down the valley to the main house, was a romantically derelict cemetery. The Earls of Carrick sold Mount Juliet to the McCalmonts in 1914, but members of the family are still buried in this lovely, lonely place. Walking up and back, I met only two other people. The only sound was the thud of hooves on new grass and the cawing of crows in the trees.</p>
        <p>BACK in the region where the only sound was the thwack of golf clubs and some sotto voce cursing, my husband reported on his round. He described the par 72, 7,112-yard course as sufficiently but not overly challenging. The open parkland layout is much more forgiving than the links courses at Ballybunion (where, two summers ago, he cheerfully played the back nine in a near-typhoon) and Lahinch (where he encountered moving hazards that turned out to be goats). The off-season greens fee for a midweek outing was $48, leaving enough cash to pay for an afternoon tour of Kilkenny Castle in the medieval town of Kilkenny, half an hour's drive away.</p>
        <p>Even closer are the medieval ruins of Jerpoint Abbey (some of whose lands are now part of the Mount Juliet estate), the antiques shops of nearby Thomastown and the craft studios in and around the village of Bennettsbridge, halfway back to Kilkenny. There, it's possible to find stylish sweaters, fancy leather bags and handblown glassware, as well as discounted pottery at the Nicholas Mosse factory store.</p>
        <p>Mapping out the next day's agenda, we resumed a long-running discussion that will be familiar to many other travelers -- the relative merits of shopping and golf as competitive sports. Miraculously, on this occasion the golfer and the shopper agreed to a truce.</p>
        <p>But where to celebrate? In the clubhouse bar or in the Tetrarch, a lounge at gracious old Mount Juliet House? In a spirit of fairness, we decided to do both.</p>
        <p>Mount Juliet Estate, Thomastown, County Kilkenny, (353-56) 73000, fax (353-56) 73019, (800) 525-4800 for United States reservations; www .mountjuliet.ie.
