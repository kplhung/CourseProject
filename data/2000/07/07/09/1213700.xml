        <p>Vice President Al Gore today denounced the ''do-nothing-for-people Congress'' and challenged Gov. George W. Bush to ''make one phone call'' to instruct Republican leaders to pass major pieces of stalled legislation.</p>
        <p>Setting out the themes he will strike in a seven-state campaign swing next week, Mr. Gore in an interview tried to tie Mr. Bush tightly to the Republican-controlled Congress and to the legislative stalemate on an array of issues.</p>
        <p>''Now is the moment when those of us who want to lead this country must stand up and be counted,'' Mr. Gore said. ''People deserve to know where we stand on the key issues now being blocked by the Republican leadership of Congress at the behest of the special interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore went on to name four issues that Congressional Democrats hope to ride hard to regain control of the House: an increase in the minimum wage, cleanup of toxic waste sites, a prescription drug benefit and regulation of health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>''My opponent has spoken in very general terms about the kind of candidate he will be, but he has been completely silent on these key issues,'' Mr. Gore said in a phone call from Air Force Two.</p>
        <p>''The question,'' he said, ''is whether or not George Bush will call the Republican leadership and tell them to pass a real patients' bill of rights. Many moderate Republicans want that. Independent voters want it. Democrats certainly want it. The special interests and the G.O.P. leaders in Congress do not. We are just one phone call away from giving the medical decisions back to the doctors.''</p>
        <p>He denounced Republican versions of a prescription drug benefit and managed care regulations as special-interest measures ''backed by tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions'' from industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore plans to ride the same theme all next week -- just as Congress returns to Washington -- in an attempt to get voters to view Mr. Bush, the Republican Congress and the Republicans' large campaign contributors as one big triangle.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor has managed to distance himself from the Congress by running as a ''compassionate conservative.'' That implicitly sets Mr. Bush apart from the conservatives former Speaker Newt Gingrich brought into the majority in 1994.</p>
        <p>And in some cases it is easier to run against the Republicans in Congress than against Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor, for example, has put forward his own plan for cleaning up the abandoned factories and junkyards in cities that are known as brownfields. But Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississippi, made a written pledge to block such a bill this year unless it is part of a more thorough overhaul of the Superfund law.</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush could call Senator Lott and fix this with one telephone conversation,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides called Mr. Gore's demand that the Texas governor step into the legislative debate a sign of the Democrat's own weaknesses.</p>
        <p>''This is an amazing display of a lack of leadership for the sitting vice president to call on the governor of Texas to pass legislation his administration has failed to get done,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's new tack builds upon the ideas he began airing several weeks ago when he started asking ''whose side are you on'' and depicting Mr. Bush and the Republicans in Congress as siding with powerful business interests over consumers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore today kept hammering away at his refrain of just one phone call. Turning to a prescription drug benefit, he said, ''If Governor Bush is willing to stand up to the big drug companies all he has to do is make one phone call and tell the leadership to pass this legislation and America's seniors will be able to get help.'' Mr. Gore said that as president he would veto the Republicans' version of a prescription drug bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have sharp philosophical differences on some of these issues. While Mr. Gore wants an expansive new prescription drug benefit added into Medicare, Mr. Bush generally supports the concept of the House Republicans. They recently passed a bill that would give subsidies and incentives to private insurers to offer prescription drug policies to the elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and the Democrats back a $1 increase in the minimum wage across two years. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush favored an increase in the minimum wage but wanted states to have the right to opt out of it if they thought the wage increase would slow job creation.</p>
        <p>Managed care legislation has been stalled in Congress because of differences between the Senate and the House, which defied its leadership and passed a more expansive bill favored by Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore backs the more wide-ranging version. Mr. Bartlett said Mr. Bush wants more people covered than the Senate does but differs somewhat with the House provisions on a right to sue companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides circulated a long list of campaign contributions to Republicans, noting that business groups opposed to a minimum wage increase had given $2.6 million to Republican Congressional candidates and party committees for the 1998 Congressional campaign. They also highlighted donations from the insurance industry, saying Republican committees and candidates had taken more than $8.6 million in contributions from ''anti-patients' bill of rights forces'' since 1997.</p>
