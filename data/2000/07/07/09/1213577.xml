        <p>IT is the 10th anniversary of Dances for Wave Hill. The series consists of new works celebrating  Wave Hill's public garden. On performance evenings, the audience moves to several sites, and can relax on the grounds of Wave Hill during performances. (Blankets and  lightweight chairs are allowed, but picnics are not permitted.)</p>
        <p>Performances feature the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company, a member of which is shown. The company, founded in 1982 by Nai-Ni Chen, a Taiwanese-born choreographer, will do a new dance, ''Liang-Ye'' (''Two Perspectives''). The work is performed by nine dancers who are accompanied by Korean percussion instruments.</p>
