        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The July 3 front-page article about the stress of sixth grade made me feel, at best, old-fashioned or, at worst, unfit to be a mother. My daughter will enter sixth grade this fall, and I have goals for her: to be active, spend time outdoors, get plenty of sleep, do well in school and enjoy her friends. I want her to continue in the art and music programs at her school, not to pad a resume but because she enjoys them. I hope she attends a college that suits her needs and finds a career that will challenge her and make her happy.</p>

        <p>I know I was raised in a different era, but somehow I managed to put myself through medical school, have a successful career and support a family. I'm glad I didn't waste my preadolescence studying for the SAT and aiming for a goal that I was too young to understand.</p>
