        <p>Soon after Hyperion, his 155-foot sailing yacht, was launched in 1998, Jim Clark discovered something unexpected: it wasn't really big enough.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon, and probably other companies yet unheard of, has commissioned a new yacht from the Royal Huisman shipyard in the Netherlands, a 292-foot three-masted schooner to be named Athena and launched in 2004.</p>
        <p>Although Hyperion is the world's largest sloop, or single-masted sailboat, sailboats are never as roomy for their length as motor yachts, which are wider and higher above the waterline. ''I've already tried to take two or three couples on Hyperion and you just can't do it,'' said Mr. Clark, who is worth $1.8 billion by the latest Forbes estimate. A swift sailboat that could sleep four other couples in suitably grand  style required close to 300 feet.</p>
        <p>That length will make Athena the largest sailing pleasure craft ever built, longer than 99 percent of the great clipper ships (like the Cutty Sark: 280 feet) that once ruled the seas.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clark already has other boats in mind: possibly a motor yacht, large enough to land his helicopter; possibly a recreation of a J-Boat, the sleek racer built by men with names like Vanderbilt and Sopwith in a previous gilded age.</p>
        <p>''I like sailing boats, and I have a policy that I get to spend as much on myself as I give away,'' said Mr. Clark, who would not directly comment on the cost. ''Since I've given away $150 million, I have a long way to go.''</p>
