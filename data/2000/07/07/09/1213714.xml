        <p>As we pulled out of the Springs Country Store, a weathered cedar bungalow with white trim and inviting wooden armchairs on the porch, Captain David Blinken was clearly stoked.

        <p>''Look at this guy, where's he going?'' Blinken said indignantly, as an innocent motorist inched up to a stop sign. Blinken's thick, elastic features changed, and his gray eyes lit up as we passed a mound of dirt on a lawn.</p>

        <p>As we pulled out of the Springs Country Store, a weathered cedar bungalow with white trim and inviting wooden armchairs on the porch, Captain David Blinken was clearly stoked. Gnawing on the chocolate-filled croissant in his left hand, the forest green Jeep Wrangler towing his 16-foot flats boat wallowing left and right, he kept up a running commentary on the wonders he beheld.</p>
        <p>''Look at this guy, where's he going?'' Blinken said indignantly, as an innocent motorist inched up to a stop sign. Blinken's thick, elastic features changed, and his gray eyes lit up as we passed a mound of dirt on a lawn.</p>
        <p>''Wow. Nice pile of gravel, huh?'' He jerked the wheel to the right. ''Hey, that traffic cone should be further out, what's up with these guys? Pass me my Yoo-Hoo. Hey -- who's got my Yoo-Hoo?''</p>
        <p>Blinken's enthusiasm was disarming and touching. And on this day in late June, it was explicable. For Blinken, a hawk-eyed 39-year-old who operates under the banner of North Flats Guiding, specializes in casting flies to visible striped bass and bluefish up on the shallow flats. For 11 gray and drizzly days, he had barely seen the sun and thus had been operating rather like the art connoisseur turned loose in the Louvre wearing a blindfold.</p>
        <p>But today, today was going to be different.</p>
        <p>Soon Blinken was push-poling us along a flat in Napeague Bay. I pointed out a deer grazing on shore, but it turned out to be a copper-colored boulder transformed by the lingering fog. It was 10:30 a.m. and still no sun. We cast blindly, sliding over water that moved along on an outgoing tide.</p>
        <p>But we caught only sea robins. These monstrous, blunt-headed creatures, so named because their pectoral fins are as large and as pliant as wings, ought to be emblazoned on the mud flaps of pickup trucks. But they're in business to survive, not to win beauty pageants, and at that they are expert. You can always count on nature to expose the flaws in man's aesthetics.</p>
        <p>At noon, as we met up with Glyn Vincent and Eugene Gearty for lunch near the Acabonack harbor inlet, momentary islands of blue appeared high in the pale sky and, pointing to a disc that resembled a communion wafer overhead, Blinken eagerly predicted, ''There's our missing sun. We'll be in business soon.''</p>
        <p>Sure enough, by the time we finished our tuna fish sandwiches, and a discussion of contemporary fly-reel engineering so boring that I considered calling 911, the overcast was visibly dissipating and the intense sunlight hurt our eyes.</p>
        <p>Gradually, the flats lit up from within. Every shell and pebble became visible, and the light reflecting off the sandy bottom turned the water the color of diluted honey. We began to see the pale, wavering gray shapes of striped bass as they leisurely cruised the flats.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, a fish would list sideways, probably to rid itself of sea lice acquired in the ocean, and for a moment its silver flank gleamed bright as a flashbulb going off underwater. We never even started the motor. The bass were all over the place, right in front of us.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, my boatmate Richard Franklin had landed and released a ''keeper,'' a stout striper of about eight pounds. But even when the fish are plentiful on the flats, their vulnerability makes them unpredictable and acutely wary. Their disposition, combined with the need to make quick, accurate casts and a seductive retrieve, guarantee most anglers a modest success ratio. If you bat .250 on the flats, you're a hall of famer.</p>
        <p>Half an hour and two bass later, Blinken abruptly declared: ''The fish aren't on this fly. It's way too big and bright.''</p>
        <p>Many saltwater fly fishers refuse to believe that fly selection can be critical to success, but I've learned from Blinken over the years that bass, if not blues, can be just as finicky as streambred trout. He clipped off the fly, a slender, glittery imitation of the bait fish commonly known as the sand eel, and replaced it with a more discreet morsel: a small crab imitation of his own invention, tied with feathers of muted earth tones. Just why these hefty fish would choose the equivalent of a sauteed mushroom cap over a big fat steak is puzzling, but they routinely do so.</p>
        <p>The greatest tonic for bad luck is high skill, and soon we were catching bass left and right. At one point, a school of four-pound bluefish appeared, advancing directly toward the boat in a symmetrical squadron. Unlike sea robins, these predators are gorgeous as well as efficient, their iridescent sides alight with tones of pale yellow and sea blue.</p>
        <p>As soon as Blinken dropped the fly near them, a bluefish bolted over to seize it. Unlike bass, which are bullish when hooked, bluefish race for the security of deep water, much like bonefish. This one severed the monofilament leader.</p>
        <p>And when our highlight reel of a day ended, we celebrated with an angler's feast of venison steaks, grilled bluefish, and a libation that most certainly was not Yoo-Hoo.</p>
