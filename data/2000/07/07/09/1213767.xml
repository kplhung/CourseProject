        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article last Sunday on the Battle of White Plains [''Uncovering the Mystery of a Childhood Treasure''] is a timely reminder that the 225th anniversary of the battle will occur on Oct. 25, 2001. The map, however, contains an inaccuracy that leaves a false impression.</p>
        <p>The opposing armies were both approximately 13,000 men strong on Oct. 28, 1776. The 1,600 shown on your map as the size of the Colonial Army approximates the number of Washington's troops that were on Chatterton Hill, where the major engagement took place. The remainder of his forces were on other hills in a large semicircle under the word ''Plains'' on your map. Chatterton Hill was the right flank of the Colonial Army.</p>
        <p>Troops from the left flank of the British Army were sent against Chatterton Hill, and up to 7,000 British and Hessian soldiers, including artillery, participated in the attack on Chatterton Hill. The forces were far from even, but the terrain was in the Colonials' favor.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, the Kensico Reservoir, which shows on your map to the north of White Plains, was not there at the time of the battle.</p>
