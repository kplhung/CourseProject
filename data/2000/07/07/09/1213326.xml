        <p>U.S. Lines Redux</p>
        <p>Q. I recently saw an advertisement for United States Lines. Is this a rebirth of the old cruise line of the S.S. United States and the America? -- Jan Heck, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. The United States Lines is returning to the high seas, but it is not the line you remember. The name was acquired by the American Classic Voyages Company, a holding company with a collection of passenger lines: American Hawaii Cruises, the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, Delta Queen Coastal Voyages and now, United States Lines. It operates from the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans.</p>

        <p>U.S. Lines Redux</p>
        <p>Q. I recently saw an advertisement for United States Lines. Is this a rebirth of the old cruise line of the S.S. United States and the America? -- Jan Heck, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. The United States Lines is returning to the high seas, but it is not the line you remember. The name was acquired by the American Classic Voyages Company, a holding company with a collection of passenger lines: American Hawaii Cruises, the Delta Queen Steamboat Company, Delta Queen Coastal Voyages and now, United States Lines. It operates from the Robin Street Wharf in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>In a phone interview, Roderick K. McLeod, the chief executive officer, said American Classic had acquired the rights to the name from an heir of a former director of the old line, which last carried passengers in 1969. It became a cargo business, then went bankrupt in the 80's.</p>
        <p>For the new line, American Classic has contracted for the first new oceangoing passenger ships to be built in the United States in 45 years. These 72,000-ton vessels, to carry 1,920 passengers each, are being built at Ingalls Shipbuilding Yard in Pascagoula, Miss., and are expected to sail in 2003 and 2004, Mr. McLeod said.</p>
        <p>The company has also acquired the 1,212-passenger Nieuw Amsterdam from Holland America; after some refitting, it will be used for weekly seven-day cruises among the Hawaiian Islands, starting Dec. 9. The ship has been renamed the Patriot, and will fly the American flag and have an American crew. When ready, the two new ships will also be used in Hawaii, the company says.</p>
        <p>The Patriot will differ from other liners mainly in its American ambience, Mr. McLeod said. ''Some of it will be in the food,'' he said. ''A lot of it will be related to the staff.''</p>
        <p>Among the changes on the ship is the removal of the casino, since Hawaii does not allow gambling; replacing it is a Hawaiian cultural center. The old United States Lines will be evoked in the names of lounges -- No. 1 Broadway, the old line's address, and Digby's Bar, after the old telephone exchange of its headquarters. The ship has two outdoor pools, and children's activity centers.</p>
        <p>The Hawaiian cruises on the Patriot will leave Honolulu on Saturday and dock at Nawiliwili, Kahului, Hilo and Kona, then return to Honolulu. Rates are $1,599 to $4,249 a person, double occupancy. Reservations and information: (877) 330-6871, and www.unitedstateslines.com.</p>
        <p>World War I Sites</p>
        <p>Q. Are there travel agencies specializing in tours of World War I battlefields in France? I am particularly interested in Verdun. -- Jack R. Siegelbaum, Ridgewood, N.J.</p>
        <p>A. Most American military tour specialists seem to deal with the Civil War or World War II. But a Virginia company, Military Historical Tours, has several tours that may interest you.</p>
        <p>According to Patrick Mooney, the company's executive vice president, there will be four to six World War I tours next year, including a two-week general overview in September 2001 that visits Verdun.</p>
        <p>This year, the company has a Western Front Battlefields tour from Aug. 16 to 25. It doesn't go to Verdun but does visit the Marne, the Somme, Flanders and Ypres Salient. The cost is $2,495 a person, including round-trip air fare from Newark, hotels, buses and at least two meals a day.</p>
        <p>Contact Military Historical Tours, 4600 Duke Street, Suite 420, Alexandria, Va. 22304; (800) 722-9501, fax (703) 212-8567; www.miltours.com.</p>
        <p>An American specialist in World War II trips, Valor Tours of Sausalito, Calif., also represents a big British battlefield tour operator, Holts Tours, which has several World War I tours each year. This year's Verdun tour, Sept. 14 to 17, is booked, but another is planned for June 2001. Details will be available in late October, Holts says.</p>
        <p>Other Holts tours this year include Four Days in Ypres, Aug. 17 to 20, from $595 a person, double occupancy; A Weekend on the Somme, Sept. 9 and 10, from $250 a person; and Armistice, Nov. 10 to 12, including a memorial service and poppy parade in Ypres, from $400 (prices include transportation from London and back, hotel and half board).</p>
        <p>To find out more, contact Valor Tours, 10 Liberty Ship Way, Sausalito, Calif. 94965; (800) 842-4504, fax (415) 332-6971, or go to Holts's Web site, www.battletours.co.uk.</p>
        <p>Another British operator, Midas Tours, Post Office Box 376, West Byfleet KT14 7FB, has a walking tour of Verdun Sept. 1 to 4. This will explore the terrain of the pivotal battle partly on foot, with walks of about eight and four miles on two of the days. It starts and ends in London and costs $600, including lodging and two meals a day. Call (44-1932) 407-000, fax (44-1932) 405-000 or see www.midastours.co.uk.</p>
        <p>Church Music in Rome</p>
        <p>Q. In Rome, my wife and I will visit many churches, which we know can seem like silent museums. Are there any where music can be heard? -- Edward Kemp, Setauket, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. While it is true -- if surprising -- that Rome does not have a big reputation for church music, many Masses are celebrated with music. Here are a few churches with music at Sunday Masses (and sometimes at weekday Masses, too):</p>
        <p>Chiesa Sant'Ignazio di Loyola, Piazza Sant'Ignazio 1; (39-06) 679-4506; at 10 and 11:30 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Chiesa Gesu e Maria, Via del Corso 45, (39-06) 361-3717; 10 a.m. in Latin, and 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Chiesa San Paolo Entro le Mura, Via Nazionale, (39-06) 488-3339; 8:30 and 10:30 a.m., and in Spanish with guitars at 1 p.m.</p>
        <p>Chiesa di Santa Maria del Popolo, Piazza del Popolo 12, (39-06) 361-0836; at 8, 9, 10 and 11 a.m. and noon.</p>
        <p>Basilica di Sant'Eustachio, Piazza Sant'Eustachio, (39-06) 329-1889; at noon and 7 p.m. At the 7 p.m. Mass on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, nuns play guitars, and on Thursday and Saturday there is organ music.</p>
        <p>On the first and third Sundays of each month this year, except August, the Benedictine monks of St. Anselmo are offering free classical music concerts before Latin vespers at the Abbey of the Aventine, Piazza Cavalieri di Malta 5; (39-06) 579-1319. The concerts are at 6 p.m., with vespers at 7:15.</p>
        <p>To find out about church concerts that are part of the Vatican Jubilee celebrations, call (39-06) 6988-7248, or see www.jubil2000.org. Concerts are also listed in Wanted in Rome, an English publication sold at newsstands (about $1.50), and its Web site, www.wantedinrome.com.</p>
