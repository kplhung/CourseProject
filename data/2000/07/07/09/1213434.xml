        <p>HE tells them his name is Crazy  Chris  these cocky teenagers who have been brought to East Jersey State Prison and stand sullenly on the auditorium stage -- and, he adds, he is serving double life for murder.</p>
        <p>His sleeves are cut off raggedly at the shoulders, an effect that makes his muscular, tattooed arms look as big as weathered tree limbs; and his craggy, bewhiskered face, battered and scarred by fists and time, is menacing, as he brings it to within inches of one of the shiny young faces.</p>
        <p>''End up here,'' he snarls, ''we'll eat you alive.''</p>
        <p>This is a scene from ''Scared Straight! 99,'' a sequel to the 1979 documentary -- which received an Oscar  and an Emmy and drew widespread attention to the program.</p>
        <p>In what is known formally as the Juvenile Awareness Program, inmates serving life sentences describe the realities of prison life to ''at-risk'' youths, using abusive language and intimidation from the beginning. The goal is to break through the defenses of even the most incorrigible youths and get them  thinking about changing their behavior before they, too, end up in the yard.</p>
        <p>At a viewing of ''Scared Straight! 99'' at the prison last July, Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune praised the program before an audience of judges, probation officers, social workers and the lifers themselves. He said its ''impact can't ever be measured.''</p>
        <p>But by December the program had been scaled back, the rules for allowing youths to attend sessions stiffened and control transferred from the Lifers' Group at the prison to corrections headquarters in West Trenton. After almost 25 years without incident, Scared Straight, as the program had come to be known, seemed to be in trouble.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious to me that they're trying to curtail it and make it fade away,'' said Alan August, a retired corrections lieutenant who helped to found the Scared Straight program in 1976 with a group of inmates serving life terms.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. August publicly voiced his concerns about the program, and almost immediately social workers, counselors and other proponents bombarded the department with letters seeking a reprieve.</p>
        <p>Despite the cutback in the schedule, corrections officials denied Scared Straight was being de-emphasized. Yet Mary Ellen Bolton, the department's chief of staff, said several months ago in a letter to the Lifers' Civilian Advisory Board, ''Research has shown that scare tactics, in and of themselves, are not effective in preventing antisocial behavior.</p>
        <p>And in an interview last July -- even before he began to re-evaluate Scared Straight, -- Mr. Terhune seemed lukewarm about the program. Instead, he praised Project Pride (Promoting Responsibility in Drug Education), which he started in early 1998, not long after after becoming commissioner.</p>
        <p>The new program sends inmates from minimum-security prisons into schools to talk about drug and alcohol problems that got them into trouble, Mr. Terhune said. And, he added, they made their point without intimidation.</p>
        <p>''They've had 50,000 students go through there in 20 years,'' he said more recently about the Scared Straight program during an interview in his office. ''Project Pride, which started in the fall of 1998 -- we've already done 32,000 students in a little over a year and a half. So if you look at it, particularly in terms of volume, we're able to reach more students in a much shorter period of time.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. August said he had no gripe with the new program, but added, ''I cannot understand why you don't keep both programs.</p>
        <p>''You need more programs for kids, not less,'' he added. ''I don't see why he is promoting Project Pride, which is a good program, and slowly destroying Scared Straight.''</p>
        <p>ELIJAH ACCOO was only 9 years old when he broke his teacher's leg.</p>
        <p>His distraught mother, Candy Graham, did not know what to do. No teacher or counselor seemed to help. She finally turned to Sheri Bouldin, a probation officer who grew up in the project in Long Branch where Ms. Graham lived with her son. Since 1994, Ms. Bouldin had taken hundreds of troubled youths through Scared Straight. Although Elijah seemed a little young, Ms. Bouldin agreed to try to get him in.</p>
        <p>The day Elijah went into East Jersey State Prison, he remembered it was Crazy Chris who sidled up to him. ''You're the one that broke the teacher's leg,'' he said. ''That was my mother.''</p>
        <p>''I was scared,'' Elijah recalled recently as he sat with his mother in the kitchen of their Long Branch home.</p>
        <p>But what viewers of the ''Scared Straight'' documentaries have never seen are the follow-up sessions at which the inmates talk civilly with the youngsters, one on one, with counselors by their side.</p>
        <p>Elijah, who will be 12 in August, went for follow-up once a month for nine months and became friendly with an inmate named Akbar, whose given name before he turned to Islam was Kevin Stout, of Plainfield. Before the first visit, Akbar talked by phone with Ms. Graham and knew the boy had a serious discipline problem. Among the things he had done was urinate on a student's leg and push a heavy desk against a teacher's leg, causing a hairline fracture.</p>
        <p>Elijah took to Akbar -- who was serving 25 years to life for felony murder and armed robbery -- almost at once because, he said,  the convicted killer was ''kind'' and ''calm.'' Ms. Graham, a single parent, said Akbar became a father figure to Elijah. He reviewed his report card, showed interest in his athletic ability, like being able to do back flips, and constantly urged him to succeed in school and life. When Elijah began slipping back, Ms. Graham would have Akbar call to get him on track. Akbar would often check on the youth's progress, even when Elijah was visiting a cousin in Niagara Falls.</p>
        <p>''He said like, 'Don't smoke, don't drop out of school,' '' Elijah recalled. ''He said don't end up like him. Don't hang around with the wrong people. Don't do drugs.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Graham, who described Akbar as ''a good man,'' is convinced he saved her son's life. Ms. Bouldin agrees. ''He went from this bundle of badness into this pleasant kid,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Elijah visited the prison regularly, long after his scheduled sessions ended. His last trip was December, before Mr. Terhune limited the program to youths specifically referred by family court, probation departments and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p>Nor has Elijah been able to speak with Akbar since Ms. Graham, a nurse's aide, became incapacitated by asthma and has been unable to afford a phone. Elijah said he missed his talks with with Akbar.</p>
        <p>That Akbar was a convicted murderer did not trouble Elijah in the least. ''I see the kind part of him,'' he said, ''the nice part of him, like the part of him that can help me.''</p>
        <p>As for what the relationship gave Akbar, Elijah said: ''Something good too. Not only will he tell me stuff like 'Don't be bad,' but I'll tell him stuff like 'Don't be bad,' because if he acts up I can't visit, if he gets locked down.''</p>
        <p>In September, after the screening of ''Scared Straight! 99,'' at East Jersey State, which premiered on MTV last August, Mr. Terhune called for an evaluation.</p>
        <p>The word came down the chain of command to Lt. Randy Sandkuhl of the Corrections Department, a liaison to the Lifers' Group, not to schedule any more Scared Straight sessions or even nonconfrontational visits by high school and college students.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the last half-year there have been only three Scared Straight sessions and none of the simple educational visits, according to officials of the Civilian Advisory Board, a group that helps the inmates raise money for the program.</p>
        <p>Still, corrections officials insist that not only has the Scared Straight program not been phased out, it has been expanded.</p>
        <p>And by their definition, it has.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terhune explained that the Juvenile Awareness Program -- or Scared Straight, as it came to be known -- was once the only program the department offered, and that the newer one had been added under its umbrella as well as tours for students to all correctional facilities.</p>
        <p>''Everyone wants to establish this is a Hatfield vs. McCoy,'' he said. ''That's not the way it is. It's a three-part program that we offer to the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Terhune, a former Teaneck police lieutenant and Bergen County sheriff who majored in psychology at Rutgers and got a master's from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that when he took office he concluded that ''that type of negative program'' was not for every school group. He decided to limit access to it.</p>
        <p>In addition, all the programs would be coordinated by the Correction Department's office of educational services in West Trenton.</p>
        <p>''The Scared Straight program is, in essence, to the best of my knowledge, the same as it has been, given the different inmates in there, but now it's one of the three that are available,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Yet under the new program, inmates are sent into schools almost every day, while the Lifers' Group, which in the past had five sessions a week, has had only three in a half-year.</p>
        <p>''Oh yeah,'' Mr. Terhune said. ''The frequency of Scared Straight has dramatically been reduced, comparatively speaking. But that's not a fair way to pose the question, I don't think, because the only thing you had here back then was Scared Straight.''</p>
        <p>To Arnold Shapiro, the producer of ''Scared Straight,'' Mr. Terhune is making a big mistake.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what his college degree is in, but I suspect it's not in child psychology or juvenile behavior,'' Mr. Shapiro said in a telephone interview from California. ''If the dozens of youth counselors, judges and other trained professionals who send kids to this program month after month, year after year want to keep it going, there must be some validity.''</p>
        <p>Bob Schoka, a social worker, took students from Meridian Academy, an alternative school for behavioral problems in Colts Neck, to ''Scared Straight'' for about five years. He those students would be excluded today under the new guidelines.</p>
        <p>''As a preventive, you want to head them off from ending up in court,'' said Mr. Schoka. ''As counselors, we see kids on a regular basis who we know could benefit from the program. Now they're taking it from out of our hands.''</p>
        <p>Yet not everyone is in agreement about the usefulness of the program. James O. Finckenauer, a professor at the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University Newark, thinks Scared Straight not only has little effect on deterring juvenile crime but may even cause more harm.</p>
        <p>''Not only did I find it didn't work,'' Dr. Finckenauer said, ''it looked like something counterproductive was going on there, that kids going there were more delinquent than those in my control group.''</p>
        <p>He said he came to this conclusion after conducting a study for the Department of Corrections in 1980 and then helping to write a 20-year retrospective, ''Scared Straight: The Panacea Phenomenon Revisited,'' (Waveland Press, Prospect Heights, Ill, 1999). In preparing the book, he said he surveyed studies of similar programs in the United States and abroad, including Norway, which modeled its program on Scared Straight.</p>
        <p>Of course, supporters of Scared Straight dismiss Dr. Finkenauer's findings. Instead, they point to those of Sidney Langer, a sociologist at Kean University, which came out shortly after Dr. Finkenauer's first study. Dr. Langer indicated that the program did have a long-term effect in deterring crime.</p>
        <p>Competing studies aside, Mr. Terhune said he had approved about a half-dozen requests from agencies seeking to send youths into Scared Straight -- though the inmates said they had never received them. Moreover, he would not say if the program was being de-emphasized, and seemed agitated when asked about it.</p>
        <p>''I'm not admitting or denying anything because I don't think I have to admit or deny anything,'' he said. ''I mean clearly, I have decisions to make. Clearly, I think Project Pride is an appropriate program for mainstream students in high schools today. At the same time, I don't think the negative yelling and screaming in Scared Straight is appropriate for mainstream high school students, plain and simple.''</p>
        <p>One recent morning, four inmates from the Lifers' Group sat gloomily in a room at the prison going over what happened.</p>
        <p>''We feel kind of bad because we're no longer allowed do what we used to do,'' said Calvin Bass, 31, of Newark, the group's president. ''And for no apparent reason.''</p>
        <p>Harun Abdul Shahid, 35, of Newark the treasurer of the group, said there had never been any mishaps -- ''24 years without incident.''</p>
        <p>Simply to join the Lifers' Group, they said, an inmate had to go before a screening committee and convince members that he has changed. Drugs are taboo, and sex offenders are not welcome.</p>
        <p>''We never professed that we can change all the kids and that we have all the solutions to the problems,'' Mr. Bass said. ''We're no angels. But by the same token, we use our own life experience, which was bad, to try to encourage another kid to not make the same mistakes we made.''</p>
        <p>As Akbar, the group's vice president, put it: ''The first thing I'm telling children when we get on the stage is, 'I've got to be the biggest fool up there.' Why? Because 23 years ago they brought me through the Scared Straight Program.''</p>
        <p>Like the others, he says that by working with young people he feels he is paying society back for his crimes.</p>
        <p>He said that after checking with Elijah's teachers, he spent more time and effort with him because of his age, emphasizing  putting school before sports and hobbies like playing the drums.</p>
        <p>''It was a hard-fought battle because of the situation he was in, the area in which he lives, his environment,'' he said. ''I became attached to him somewhat, but I had to detach myself from him because of the multitude of children that we deal with.''</p>
        <p>Crazy Chris, or 63-year-old Chris DeLuise, from New York City, as his prison forms say, who has been in the program the longest, since 1981, observed: ''A lot of them want to be your friend and that ain't what this is about. You don't want them looking up to you. You've got to be careful with that.''</p>
        <p>They can't always be sure what effect  they have had, but are delighted years later when they get a letter or a visit.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this, for a lot of us, is where we'll die,'' Mr. Bass said. ''When they gave us life, they gave us life. We took that bitterness and turned it around into a good cause.''</p>
        <p>And what had they gotten out of it?</p>
        <p>Crazy Chris answered with one word: ''Peace.''</p>
