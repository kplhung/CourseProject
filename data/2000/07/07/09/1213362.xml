        <p>To the Editor: Two days before  the Practical Traveler column  on airport improvements appeared (''Making Airports More Tolerable,'' May 21), I was stuck at O'Hare for seven hours, thanks partly to the weather, partly to United.</p>
        <p>To kill time, my sons and I wandered around a lot, in and out of food courts, etc. And the big news is not that Wolfgang Puck has another of his la-de-dah places in the United Terminal; it is that the Billy Goat Tavern is there! In the unlikely case that anyone is unfamiliar with it, the Billy Goat is a legendary joint down below Michigan Avenue, by the Wrigley Building and across from the Tribune. It has classic greasy food, and is best known for the reply of  the boss, Sam Sianis, to endless requests for french fries: ''Cheeps, no fries.''</p>

        <p>For many years, before the beginning of the opening day game at Wrigley Field, someone would open a door along the first base line and a goat would wander out into right field. The goat was a metaphorical descendant of a goat that was refused admission to the World Series in 1945 even though Mr. Sianis's uncle, William, had a ticket for it.</p>
