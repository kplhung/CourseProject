        <p>HEATHER AND JAMES WESTRIN of Lansing, Mich., looked forward to driving to Traverse City, Mich., for a long Fourth of July weekend. But as gasoline prices soared, the prospect of paying $2 or more a gallon for the 350-mile round trip lost its appeal. ''It's too much to pay,'' said Mrs. Westrin, a travel agent.</p>
        <p>Noble Small and his wife, Skip, a retired couple living in Ardmore, Okla., look forward to jumping into their Dodge pickup every August and pulling a trailer to California, then heading back home by way of Colorado. But they will omit California from their itinerary next month. For after estimating the cost of gasoline, Mr. Small, who before retiring owned a wholesale oil company, calculated that by taking the shorter trip they could save as much as $400.</p>
        <p>In a summer in which 121.9 million American adults planned to take vacations, according to survey results released May 10 by the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America and the AAA, the Westrins and the Smalls do not represent most adult Americans. But they are representative of an apparently large segment who are canceling or shortening their summer vacations because of gasoline prices that are sky-high.</p>
        <p>The $1.54 average cost of a gallon of gasoline in March was the highest since July 1981, when it was $1.38, according to the AAA. But by mid-June, after weeks of increases, the average price had risen to $1.65, up from $1 a gallon much of last summer.</p>
        <p>At about the same time, regular unleaded gasoline rose above $2 a gallon in parts of Kansas, Michigan and Missouri, and into the $1.90's in Wisconsin and Illinois. In Chicago it climbed as high as $2.33. South Dakotans were paying almost $1.90 for unleaded regular in late June, and $2.03 for premium. Premium gasoline also topped $2 a gallon in Connecticut and Hawaii.</p>
        <p>Resistance to rising gas prices should come as no surprise. In the joint Travel Industry Association-AAA survey, conducted in April when gasoline prices were rising but not yet out of sight, 46 percent of respondents (56.1 million adults) said that they would consider canceling summer travel plans if gas prices rose to $2 a gallon.</p>
        <p>In a speech to the National Press Club on June 22, William S. Norman, the president of the Travel Industry Association, said that although travelers were worried about rising gas prices, the ''average American family traveling by auto will spend only about five percent of its total vacation budget on gasoline.'' With the average length of a pleasure trip by car about 700 miles round trip, he said, the difference in fuel cost is about $13 -- about the cost of a large pizza at Domino's.</p>
        <p>But motorists do not necessarily make such comparisons. ''Gas prices tend to be a psychological barrier,'' said Jerry Cheske, who has monitored fuel prices for the AAA for 27 years.</p>
        <p>A random sampling of desinations, including the Six Flags theme parks, the Jersey Shore and the nation's two most popular tourist sites, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., found no appreciable falloff in visitors. Yet there are many indications that, like Noble and Skip Small, lots of travelers are economizing.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had people tell us they won't be driving this summer, but plenty of them have said they're going to downsize,'' said John A. Craig, the owner of Pathfinder Travel Service in Olathe, Kan. ''They say they don't plan to stay as long or go as far.''</p>
        <p>Aileen Vining, a travel agent in Joplin, Mo., said: ''If there are only two or at the most three people traveling together, they'll give a lot of thought to flying, because gas prices are so high around here. But if it's a family of four or more, they'll likely drive or stay home, because there aren't many air-fare bargains this summer.''</p>
        <p>Not only are there few air-fare bargains; air fares have risen each of the past three months, jumping nearly 16 percent in June. Fuel prices played a big part, according to the Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade organization. It noted that aviation fuel skyrocketed to 77 cents a gallon in the first quarter of this year from 44 cents over the same period last year, and is likely to remain high for much of the rest of 2000. To offset that, seven major airlines imposed a $30 surtax in May on domestic round-trip tickets.</p>
        <p>Priceline.com recently added gasoline to its growing list of items for which members can ''name your own price,'' and other Internet companies are said to be working on plans that they say will lower fuel costs for drivers. In the meantime, analysts at Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, J. P. Morgan and Banc of America Securities have warned that even increased oil output by the major producers is not likely to return gasoline prices to anywhere near normal before the end of summer.</p>
