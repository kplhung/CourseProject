      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Bless Jim Lehrer. He's hard-working, diligent, productive, questioning, sometimes droll. In addition to his duties as a television journalist, he has a fiction habit that has produced several down-home comic novels, a Beltway thriller, a high-concept political campaign caper, a C.I.A. confection and now, in his 12th, THE SPECIAL PRISONER (Random House, $23.95), a serious and well-researched moral inquiry. Is homicide ever justifiable? In the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, John Quincy Watson, the 71-year-old retired Methodist bishop of San Antonio, recognizes the eyes of ''the Hyena'' -- the man who, half a century earlier, had tortured him in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. Watson follows the man, whose name on the airline manifest is Tashimoto, on the next flight to San Diego, finds his hotel and knocks on the door of room 1808. In alternating chapters the reader learns about Watson's brief, youthful service as a pilot during World War II and his harrowing experiences as a P.O.W., his postwar marriage to the nurse who accepted what torture had done to his ''basic equipment,'' his religious vocation and sustaining friendship with a few fellow survivors of that terrible camp. Those episodes are woven around the hotel room confrontation, the death of Bill Joe Tashimoto and the eventual murder trial. Before Watson is judged, the reader is asked to consider issues of wartime behavior, survivor's guilt, peacetime resolution and the notion of self-defense. Lehrer's research shows. There are even explicit bibliographic references to the important texts about Japanese war crimes, background surely for the carefully plotted set pieces. ''The Special Prisoner'' feels more like a study for the heir to the ''well-made play'' -- the well-made-for-television movie. Lehrer's book is worthy and wanting at the same time.</p>
