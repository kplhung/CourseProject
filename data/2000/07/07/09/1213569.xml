        <p>Catherine Peter Yatrakis was married on Thursday evening to Alistair Evelpidis Economakis at St. Panteleimon Greek Orthodox Church in Skiros on the Greek island of Skiros.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Economakis, 28, is a daughter of Kathyrn and Peter D. Yatrakis of Brooklyn. Mr. Economakis, 29, is a son of Tara and Alexander E. Economakis of Hook, England.</p>
        <p>The bride is a manager for the Granite International Management Corporation, a real estate company in Brooklyn of which her father is president. Previously, she worked as the vice president for marketing of the Yanni International Management Corporation in Bloomington, Minn., which represents Yanni, the musical entertainer.</p>
        <p>The bride's mother is the dean of academic affairs at Columbia College in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom received a bachelor's degree in marine biology and environmental science from Boston University, from which he also received a master's degree and a Ph.D. in biology. He is now developing plans for a national aquarium in Greece.</p>
        <p>His father retired as the president of Aeco Maritime, a former shipping concern based in Athens. The bridegroom's mother is a hypnotherapist at the Hampshire Clinic in Basingstoke, England.</p>
        <p>Although their fathers were friends and classmates at Columbia and the couple had met before, they did not begin dating until 1998, after their families spent that New Year's holiday together in Culebra, P.R.</p>
