        <p>Word just came down that they're abolishing Titles &amp; Subheads as a stand-alone department. Surprise, surprise. The e-mail blames ''escalating decay of the standard author-publisher interface model.'' Translation: spoiled-brat writers nowadays design the jackets, pick the typefaces and cram their own titles down the publisher's throat. Think a pro like me would ever have come up with ''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius''? That's what happens when the authors get it locked into their contracts that they call the shots. Pure ego if you ask me. I'm the guy who changed ''Dollar Bills All Over My Lawn'' to ''The Millionaire Next Door.'' Made the guy a fortune. And suddenly I'm a superannuated hack cleaning out his desk.</p>
        <p>It was all so different when I started out in the title game, way back. The legendary Eberhard Faber, a k a Mr. All Quiet on the Western Front (he'd threatened to quit if they went ahead with Remarque's own title, ''Ouch, I'm Shot''), came up with that immortal in two minutes flat. Old E.F. made Titles &amp; Subheads a calling, not just a job. Hit title after hit title. He'd just changed ''A Bad Day for Fishing'' to ''The Old Man and the Sea'' when I came aboard. Ironically, E.F. quit to go Hollywood right around then. Yep, ''All About Eve'' was his. It had been ''Jerks of Old Broadway,'' you know.</p>

        <p>Cub title writers in those days always got assigned to Celebrity Bios because no real skill was required. The name was the only game in that category back then: ''I'm Sir Cedric Hardwicke,'' ''They Call Us the Harmonica Rascals,'' ''The Lupe Velez Story.'' It was yours truly, all false modesty aside, who more or less revolutionized the genre. One day they gave me the autobio of that singer with the Glenn Miller Orchestra, the late Tex Beneke. I dash off ''Tex Beneke,'' subhead it ''Singer &amp; Sax Player With the Glenn Miller Orchestra,'' then put the slip in the pneumatic tube and sit back waiting for lunch hour. But thinking Tex Beneke had got me humming that damn hit song he sang, and -- wham! -- I had it. Spent the rest of the day trying to decide whether the title should be ''Pardon Me, Boy'' or just ''Chattanooga Choo-Choo.'' Can't even remember now which one I used. Point being, I'd invented the Celebrity Bio Hook-and-Trigger. That autobio rocketed up the best-seller list, and so did every other one that used the Hook-and-Trigger. Hook on to a best-selling song if it's a singer, the title of a movie if it's an actor, and so forth, and you trigger an emotional tide that washes 'em right up to the cash register. A career idea.</p>
        <p>The summit was the big Michael Caine autobio a few years back. ''Michael Caine Here'' just sounded lame. Simultaneously hooking-and-triggering a movie and a song, I retitled it ''What's It All About, Alfie?'' Pow! Michael sent me some smoked salmon -- well, the department. But it was the same thing, because by then I was the department. A few thousand titles later, of course, my personal brainstorm had flattened out into a mindless universal formula. Which was why Ben Kingsley's bio bombed a few years back. ''Gandhi.'' Total confusion, 96-percent returns.</p>
        <p>Celebrity Bios had become only a part of my job by then, and far from the most challenging. They'd bring all the toughies by my cubicle, regardless of category. I was the one who turned around ''Possessed by Love,'' which just lay there, to ''By Love Possessed.'' Jumble the word order, oldest titler's trick there is. Remember ''Peyton Place''? My 11th-hour substitute for ''That Darned Tramp.'' It took a special kind of gift to know when to get all fancy with a book title and when to play it dead straight. Don't ask why I knew ''Sunrise at Campobello'' was better than ''Call the Doctor,'' any more than why ''The Day Lincoln Was Shot'' was going to work and ''Maniacs, Murder and Mourning'' wasn't. Authors as a rule just don't have an ear for boffo titles. I remember spending hours on the phone, talking Rachel Carson down from calling her book ''Dead Birds and Bug Spray.'' Norman Podhoretz was going to title his first memoir ''Climbing the Ivory Tower: The Forging of an Intellectual Career'' before I told him: ''No, Norm. You're strictly a 'Making It' kind of guy.''</p>
        <p>And I was strictly the kind who always believed that cruising the spines, as we pros called it -- browsing the bookstore shelves -- ought to be a voyage of intrigue. Part info, part imagery, part magic; and not like shopping for a can of stewed tomatoes. All that's old hat now, with so much highfalutin chin music scrambling book buyers' minds, slowing them down, clogging the aisles. The days of Titles &amp; Subheads and hopeless idealists like me are over. I've had offers to do some consulting on Internet start-up names. Candy from babies by comparison. Bafflegab-dot-com. Internet names don't even have to make sense. I'll get to use quince and brummagem and all those portmanteau words I could never work into a book title. (Hey, how about portmanteau-dot-com?) So the professional title writers fade away and the know-it-all authors take over. So, let the lunatics run the asylum.</p>
        <p>''A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.'' PS: That isn't a title, it's a blurb. Not that anybody knows the difference anymore.</p>
