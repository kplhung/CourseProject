        <p>TUCKED all the way in the back of the top floor at Bergdorf Goodman, behind the pillows and the coffee tables, the Manon chocolates and the tins of caviar, is a book-filled nook titled Jane Stubbs. And tucked behind the stacks of rare and vintage books is a woman tucked behind an enormous shirt and thick glasses, with the milky complexion of an attic-dwelling bookworm who seems perennially startled at the notion of visitors. One shopper, surveying the mounds of books jumbled on tables and ladders and chairs, spotted her and asked, ''Do you ever look through them?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stubbs, 42, peered at her nervously. ''Oh, goodness, it's what I do all the time,'' she answered in her soft-spoken Southern drawl. ''It's my life's mission to uncover the flotsam and jetsam of the publishing world and force people to have libraries of same. It tickles me so much.''</p>

        <p>TUCKED all the way in the back of the top floor at Bergdorf Goodman, behind the pillows and the coffee tables, the Manon chocolates and the tins of caviar, is a book-filled nook titled Jane Stubbs. And tucked behind the stacks of rare and vintage books is a woman tucked behind an enormous shirt and thick glasses, with the milky complexion of an attic-dwelling bookworm who seems perennially startled at the notion of visitors. One shopper, surveying the mounds of books jumbled on tables and ladders and chairs, spotted her and asked, ''Do you ever look through them?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stubbs, 42, peered at her nervously. ''Oh, goodness, it's what I do all the time,'' she answered in her soft-spoken Southern drawl. ''It's my life's mission to uncover the flotsam and jetsam of the publishing world and force people to have libraries of same. It tickles me so much.''</p>
        <p>Which would explain why this is the place to find books like ''Candy Hits'' by ZaSu Pitts, billed on its cover as ''The famous star's own candy recipes.'' Or Edith Head's ''How to Dress for Success,'' with the subtitle: ''In business, in love, in society, in marriage, in school, in old age, for your husband, for your children.''</p>
        <p>Book-savvy New Yorkers know Ms. Stubbs from her previous business, Stubbs Books and Prints, which she owned with her former husband, John Stubbs. The store, which closed in 1997 after the couple's marriage ended, specialized in architectural books and prints, though, as time went on, its inventory had started to include Ms. Stubb's ''flotsam and jetsam.'' As she said, ''I'd go to book fairs and think, If I see one more copy of 'The History of American Houses' I'll die. I looked for books that amused me and started selling them.''</p>
        <p>Granted, it's somewhat surprising to find someone like Ms. Stubbs on the premises with Prada, but many department stores have been searching out attractions and novelties to compete with the boom of downtown boutiques that entice customers with everything from D.J.'s to computerized dogs roaming the racks.</p>
        <p>At Bergdorf, vintage books aren't that odd an offering; the store already sells vintage hotel silver and tea-themed merchandise, all of which qualify as one-of-a-kind gifts. Ms. Stubbs's boutique has also proved popular with the store's bridal registry.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Manville, the buyer for Bergdorf's decorative home department, says that the store's next Christmas catalog will feature a ''well-rounded library'' assembled by Ms. Stubbs that will include ''75 linear feet of vintage cloth and leather volumes, first and later editions covering art, fashion, travel, gardening, food and wine, poetry, literature and reference.'' That comes to about 750 books. Price tag? $30,000.</p>
        <p>Well, style-challenged men and women aren't above seeking the counsel of a personal shopper when they need guidance getting dressed. Why not have someone who can fashionably outfit the life of the mind?</p>
        <p>''I interview people and find out their interests,'' Ms. Stubbs explained, settling at a table in the store's employee's cafeteria. ''I recently did a little project for Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Berge, for their house in Tangier. There were books on Morocco, fun guest room things. I'm not a good houseguest myself. I hate the idea of waking up at 3 a.m. and the panic of not finding anything to read.'' She ran her hand through her bluntly chopped hair. ''A lot of this business has come from my own neurosis. I traveled around with two big bags of books for so long it was ridiculous. I'm trying to be braver.''</p>
        <p>One of Ms. Stubbs's favorite projects was creating a library for Greg Jordan, a decorator based in Manhattan. ''He wanted books on revolution,'' she said, ''so I started with revolution in thought -- classical ideas, political thought and philosophy and ended with modern-day armed revolutions, which included biographies and decorative arts of an era under that umbrella. I was given a deadline of six weeks to fill 150 feet. It was hard but a great success.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stubbs finds her merchandise at book fairs, flea markets, sometimes even on the Internet, though there is nothing else about her that seems remotely contemporary. She seems to have stepped out of a story by Flannery O'Connor.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Natchez, Miss., she described her mother, with a demure smile, as ''absolutely barking, howling mad.''</p>
        <p>''My earliest memories are of going to country auctions with her,'' she continued. ''She had a little antique shop she ran from time to time, unless she couldn't get out of her bed. We lived in a very beautiful house and she had a remarkable eye.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stubbs's father died when she was 12. ''My mother had her pilot's license, and she flew me to summer camp in her little airplane,'' she recalled. ''I got to steer. It was so dramatic. But then she forgot about me. I stayed with the owner of the camp for three days after it ended. She was off somewhere -- what could you do?'' She sighed. ''She was a combination of highs and lows. At that early age I learned that everything had a price.''</p>
        <p>Her favorite escape was reading. ''It's all I've ever really done,'' she said. ''I came to New York in 1981 with a suitcase and 13 boxes of books.'' She planned to attend film school, but instead married John Stubbs, a distant cousin, and their business began.</p>
        <p>Between the store's demise and her reincarnation at Bergdorf, which started last December, Ms. Stubbs mounted exhibitions for the Municipal Arts Society. ''I had a little sinking spell, and then I bounced up,'' she said with a shy smile. ''It was hard to turn 40, have my husband leave me for a younger person and have my business close. But they all were the best possible things. I never would have had the courage to go out on my own.''</p>
        <p>We returned to the book nook so she could help me assemble a theoretical collection. Though her custom-made libraries are ordered by the linear foot, individual books here sell mostly in the $75-to-$300 range -- which is why I was sticking to the theoretical.</p>
        <p>''I tell people to choose what reflects their interests,'' Ms. Stubbs said. ''It's crazy to have just what is considered to be classic literature if it has nothing to do with people's interests. You have to make a library a living thing. One of the goals is to have it in place, then add to and subtract from it as the household grows and acquires new interests. I'm as fond as the next person of beautiful bindings, but it's boring to have pristine fancy bindings of books that never leave the shelf.''</p>
        <p>I told her that I liked reading cookbooks, biographies, especially about show business, and anything about behavior, past and present.</p>
        <p>In an instant there was a pile before me:</p>
        <p>''How to Do It, or the Lively Art of Entertaining'' by Elsa Maxwell was first. I paged through and read, ''In someone else's house, above all leave the furniture alone.''</p>
        <p>Then there was ''Our Favourite Dish: The Theatre Recipe Book,'' a compilation of 250 recipes contributed by members of the ''British Theatrical Profession''. One look at Adele Dixon's ''Stuffed Rashers of Bacon'' convinced me to put it right down.</p>
        <p>I loved the idea of staying in bed with ''The Heart Has Its Reasons: The Memoirs of the Duchess of Windsor,'' and I also loved ''The Working Girl Must Eat,'' whose cover read: ''This cookbook, with its menus, recipes and instructions for almost a hundred easy-to-get dinners, was written especially for this girl and the thousands like her who hold down jobs and also do some housekeeping. Open it anywhere and see why she is still smiling when dinner is on the table.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Stubbs also suggested ''The Top Drawer: Random Recollections by One Who Was Born in It.'' Published in 1928, its author remains anonymous. Then she found ''Reno,'' a novel about divorce by Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr., and ''The Title Market,'' a novel by Emily Post, about the fine art of marrying a man with a title.</p>
        <p>She had read all these books and described each one lovingly. I asked what she was reading now.</p>
        <p>''Curious Punishments of Bygone Days,'' by Alice Earle, she said promptly. ''It's a history of public punishment in America. I'm in the dunking chapter now. I was reading it while I had a pedicure yesterday.'' She sighed. ''It just gives me so much pleasure.''</p>
        <p>It probably doesn't even occur to her to shop at places like Barnes &amp; Noble, much less worry about them as competition.</p>
        <p>She shook her head. ''With my kind of quirky things, nobody else has exactly the same stuff.'' Her smile seemed both content and conspiratorial. ''To be very special, or very weird,'' she said, ''can save you.''</p>
