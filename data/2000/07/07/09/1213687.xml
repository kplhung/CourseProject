        <p>With the failure today of the Pentagon's antimissile test, the Clinton administration has reaped all of the diplomatic disadvantages of its program to build a national missile defense and none of the potential rewards.</p>
        <p>The program has led to an arms stalemate with Moscow. It has strained relations with Bejing. And it has raised alarms in Western Europe, where American allies fear the antimissile program could spur a new arms race and reflects a penchant to go it alone on security policy.</p>
        <p>The administration had been hoping the test would demonstrate that a new defensive system was virtually at hand and give it more negotiating leverage with the Russians, who  have been adamantly opposed to the antimissile plan. Now, as the Clinton administration's days wind down, it has little to show for its efforts.</p>
        <p>One reason the administration pursued missile defense was to protect Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, against charges that the Clinton administration was soft on defense. Even those political gains have been dissipated. Republican supporters of missile defense are likely to criticize the Clinton administration's management of the antimissile program.</p>
        <p>All military programs suffer setbacks from time to time, andthe test failure today does not mean that a missile shield can never be constructed. The failure occurred when the kill vehicle that was supposed to slam into a dummy warhead failed to separate from its booster. So the ability of the kill vehicle to intercept the warhead -- the key capability that was to be assessed -- was never actually put to the test.</p>
        <p>Still, after all the months of preparation, the failure was an unqualified embarrassment for the Pentagon and suggested that it had been in too much of a rush to build a defense.</p>
        <p>The failure also raised questions about the Clinton administration's diplomacy, which seems to be out of sync with the United States' technological capabilities. For almost a year, the administration has been in the odd position of lobbying Russia, China and Western Europe to acquiesce in the Pentagon's antimissile plans before that program has even gotten off the ground.</p>
        <p>Even before it can demonstrate the feasibility of its new antimissile technology, for example, the Clinton administration has demanded that Moscow agree to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a move that is needed so that the Pentagon can legally begin construction of a new battle-management radar system in Alaska and the deployment of 100 interceptors there.</p>
        <p>That American demand has become a major obstacle in the quest to negotiate a third strategic arms reduction treaty with the Russians that would make deeper cuts in strategic nuclear arms. The Russians have proposed that a Start III accord reduce strategic warheads to a level of 1,500, while the United States has insisted on 2,000 to 2,500 warheads.</p>
        <p>But a Start III accord is not possible while the two sides are at loggerheads over missile defenses. Washington has continued to press for a compromise, and before today's test, the Clinton administration had calculated that a success might soften Moscow. If the test worked, Washington would be to able to tell the Russians that the momentum toward a missile shield was all but unstoppable and that they would be wise to negotiate a broad understanding on defensive and offensive systems before President Clinton's term ran out. If the Russians failed to amend the ABM accord during Mr. Clinton's term, a future administration might simply abandon the agreement -- or so the argument went.</p>
        <p>The test failure, however, undercut that diplomatic strategy. Emboldened by the test failure, Russia reaffirmed its opposition to the missile defense plan today.</p>
        <p>''In its current technical form, the national missile defense system, which is being tested, cannot guarantee the protection of U.S. territory,'' said Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's strategic missile force. ''Even the first trials, which began with a failure, are an attempt by the U.S. military to defy the world community.''</p>
        <p>Still, there may be a silver lining in the dark cloud for President Clinton. He has faced the difficult decision of whether to move ahead with an antimissile program in the face of Russian opposition and concerns that it would violate the ABM treaty. Now, he has a justification to leave that  decision to a future administration.</p>
        <p>And the test failure may also lead to some rethinking of the potential missile threat from third world states and how to deal with it. One reason the administration has wanted to move quickly with the system and the diplomacy to allow it is the intelligence assessments about the evolving missile threat.</p>
        <p>The only country that has the potential over the next several years to field an ocean-spanning missile that could strike the United States with a nuclear payload is North Korea, which intelligence estimates say could have such a weapon by 2005. And North Korea cannot do so as long as its observes a moratorium on missile flight tests, a ban it has recently agreed to extend.</p>
        <p>Still, advocates of missile defense have argued that North Korea might break out of that accord and build a rudimentary intercontinental-range missile in a matter of months. Even though the United States has more than 6,000 nuclear warheads, the proponents of a national missile defense insist that might not be sufficient to deter an attack.</p>
        <p>With the test failure, however, the Pentagon's goal to deploy a limited defense by 2005 is likely to slip. And some military experts have already said that goal is too optimistic.</p>
        <p>Missile defense advocates may not like the idea of relying on deterrence, but the test results today indicate that the United States has no choice but to depend on it for years to come.</p>
