        <p>IMAGINE being a man of the 90's and not having a single pair of khaki Dockers in your closet. Mazda found itself similarly naked in recent years; without a sport utility vehicle, it was missing out on the hottest auto fashion trend of the decade.</p>

        <p>IMAGINE being a man of the 90's and not having a single pair of khaki Dockers in your closet. Mazda found itself similarly naked in recent years; without a sport utility vehicle, it was missing out on the hottest auto fashion trend of the decade.</p>
        <p>Mazda had, in fact, offered a sport utility, the Navajo, but dropped it in 1994. At a time when buyers were clamoring for four doors, the Navajo came with only two. In fact, it was essentially a two-door Ford Explorer.</p>
        <p>Next month, Mazda will offer another S.U.V. with some Ford chromosomes, and this one may have a brighter future. The 2001 Tribute is similar in many respects to the new Ford Escape, with which it shares best-in-class potential in a booming segment of the car market.</p>
        <p>Sales of small sport utilities, or ''cute utes,'' have more than doubled in the last four years, and further growth is expected both in the United States and overseas. The Honda CR-V currently leads the pack in sales, followed by the Toyota RAV4.</p>
        <p>While both Ford and Mazda recognized that they needed a small sport utility, they initially went their separate ways. Ford looked at borrowing the underlying body structure of the Contour and Mystique sedans; Mazda considered the platform of the MPV minivan and the 626 sedan.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the two brands -- Mazda is controlled by the Ford Motor Company -- came together to develop an entirely new platform. While Mazda staff members took the lead role in development, and the two vehicles were largely designed and engineered in Japan, they are built at a Ford plant near Kansas City, Mo. Annual capacity is a formidable 250,000 Tributes and Escapes, with Mazda taking about 40,000 for the American market; it will also build a right-hand-drive version in Japan. Ford will split the rest of the production between the United States and 167 overseas markets.</p>
        <p>Aimed at young singles, couples and small families on budgets, the Tribute, along with the Escape, leads the pack, at least for now, in size, refinement and practicality. The four-door, five-passenger Tribute is smaller than the former Navajo and current Explorer but almost a half-foot longer than the current Jeep Cherokee.</p>
        <p>The Tribute and Escape are the first of a new wave of cute utes that are slightly larger and more substantial. The next RAV4, due this fall, is larger than the vehicle it replaces; the next-generation CR-V will bulk up; and even the Cherokee will grow when it is redesigned as a 2002 model.</p>
        <p>The Escape looks a little like a shrunken Explorer, and it has the same outdoorsy style. Mazda aims for a more elegant appearance; in fashion terms, the Tribute is gray flannel trousers while the Escape, with its rugged-looking front fascia and plastic lower-body trim, would be blue jeans. None of the exterior pieces are shared except for the roof, windshield and side door glass.</p>
        <p>It's the same story inside; the two vehicles share few visible components. The Tribute's dashboard and radio are similar to those in the Mazda MPV minivan; the Escape has black-on-white gauges like some Explorers. In keeping with its refined image, the Tribute test vehicle, a top-line ES, came with leather seats, a six-way power driver's seat and an excellent optional sound system: a 190-watt, 7-speaker radio with cassette player and six-CD changer.</p>
        <p>Despite their compact dimensions, the Tribute and Escape are roomy. Ford and Mazda say the pair have the most space in their class. My passengers certainly had plenty of headroom and sufficient legroom.</p>
        <p>Though it's no Expedition, the Tribute can carry a respectable amount of cargo; there is 33 cubic feet behind the back seat, which folds for more space. The cargo bay is tall enough to carry bicycles upright. The large rear opening and low vehicle height make it easy to load bulky items, like the fully assembled computer desk I hauled in the Tribute. The temporary spare tire is hidden beneath the cargo floor.</p>
        <p>The Tribute has a new one-piece unit body, a carlike design with several advantages over S.U.V.'s built with truck components. Getting in and out is easy, thanks to a low floor height, generous door openings and beefy grab handles. Since the Tribute weighs less than truck-style utilities, its handling and fuel economy are more like a car's. The base DX model has a 2-liter, 130-horsepower 4-cylinder that comes only with a five-speed stick shift. With front-wheel drive, it has a fuel-economy rating of up to 28 miles per gallon.</p>
        <p>The ES and the medium-trim LX have a 3-liter, 200-horsepower V-6, which is paired only with a four-speed automatic transmission. This engine, one of the few V-6's offered in small S.U.V.'s, achieves 18 m.p.g. in the city and 24 on the highway, with or without four-wheel drive. With the optional towing package, the V-6 can haul up to 3,500 pounds.</p>
        <p>I didn't tow anything, but the gold ES was plenty quick accelerating from stoplights and passing on the freeway. Equipped with a four-wheel independent suspension -- most S.U.V.'s still use relatively unsophisticated live axles -- the Tribute maneuvers like a car, and it rides smoothly. It hugged corners competently at higher speeds than I expected, yet kept passengers upright and comfortable without much body roll. But more sound-deadening material would have been nice; a trucklike abundance of road noise came through the floor.</p>
        <p>Aside from its styling and interior appointments, the Tribute rides and handles slightly differently than the Escape. Mazda advertising has positioned the Tribute as a sport utility with a sports car soul. Commercials show a Tribute driving a slalom course around black Miata roadsters. The Tribute does have slightly tighter handling and steering than the Escape, but the differences are quite subtle.</p>
        <p>All three trim levels can be equipped with a new on-demand four-wheel-drive system, giving the Tribute more grip on muddy, rutted roads or snowy pavement. In normal conditions, the vehicle operates in front-wheel drive. When the system detects a loss of traction, the system hydraulically and seamlessly transfers up to half of the power to the rear wheels. A dashboard switch allows the driver to lock the system in four-wheel drive on slippery roads. There is not a  low gear range for extreme conditions.</p>
        <p>The Tribute's safety features include standard dual front air bags and new child-seat latches that will be required by law next year. Side air bags and antilock brakes come as a $495 option package.</p>
        <p>The Tribute starts at $17,520, about $600 less than the base Escape. The LX starts at $19,655, about $1,680 less than the comparable Escape. Fully equipped models run around $25,000. Mazda has kept its prices below Ford's in an attempt to lure potential buyers into showrooms that had been devoid of sport utilities. Now Mazda has the goods, they're stylish and fit nicely, and they're priced to sell.</p>
