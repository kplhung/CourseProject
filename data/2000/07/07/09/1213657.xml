        <p>A COUPLE of weekends ago, Low Rider magazine's ''Boulevard'' tour set down at Old Bridge Raceway near Englishtown, N.J. There, owners showed off their sporty compact cars, customized in color schemes that ran from bright yellows and greens to lilacs, aubergines and salmons.</p>
        <p>But the color coordination sometimes went beyond the body panels, dashboards, seats, engines and hoses. On some cars, even the tire treads got into the act.</p>
        <p>Now everyday car owners, not just car enthusiasts, can take the color-coordination process one step further, too. Rick Shafer, marketing manager for BFGoodrich's passenger performance tires, is the executive behind the colorful Scorcher T/A, which combines ''red-hot looks,'' he said, with ''unmatched performance capabilities.'' The tires are priced at $193 to $325 each, depending on the size.</p>
        <p>Last year, BFGoodrich, a part of Michelin North America, introduced the Scorcher T/A with a choice of red, blue or yellow bands in the tread. (The colors are not on the sidewall.) Now, when buyers go online to www.bfgoodrichtires.com, they can choose two tones, from a palette of eight, and decide where they want each applied in the tread. The choices are blue, light green, orange, orchid, purple, red, teal and yellow.</p>
        <p>The company says many buyers leave their tires turned outward when they park their cars, just so passers-by can see the distinctive stripes.</p>
        <p>Ordering the tires takes about five minutes; delivery, to the local tire store or the buyer's home, takes four to six weeks -- a wait that the company hopes to shorten to as little as two weeks.</p>
        <p>''It is the ultimate finishing touch for anyone who wants to bring a unique look to their vehicle,'' Mr. Shafer said.</p>
        <p>And a long way from whitewalls.</p>
