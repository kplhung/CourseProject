        <p>THE ESSENTIAL WILLIAM H. WHYTE</p>
        <p>Edited by Albert LaFarge.</p>
        <p>Fordham University,</p>
        <p>cloth, $39.95; paper, $19.95.</p>
        <p>In the 1950's, the sociologist William H. Whyte (1917-99) discovered that the average businessman's greatest aspiration was to move to the suburbs and lose himself within a big corporation's multitudes of middle management. Whyte labeled this type the ''Organization Man,'' and warned that the collective influence of millions of such organization men would transform society, replacing the rugged individualism of the American Dream with a new ethic of conformity. ''The Essential William H. Whyte,'' edited by Albert LaFarge, once Whyte's editor, contains an excerpt from Whyte's book ''The Organization Man'' (1956), as well as a number of the Fortune magazine articles in which he developed this thesis. Whyte concluded that ''the peace of mind offered by organization remains a surrender,'' and that the sought-after contentment comes at the price of an individual's creativity. Whyte advocated the efficiency of small business during a time of big business triumphalism. He warned against suburban sprawl. And he celebrated the excitement and energy of urban life while an enormous exodus from the cities was taking place. But, perhaps more important, Whyte provided a general blueprint for the study of change. He engaged in good research. He advanced moderate, nonutopian suggestions. And he succumbed to neither romantic illusions about the past nor fatalistic visions of the future. Reading ''The Essential William H. Whyte'' restores faith that change can be understood, and that the ever-quickening pace of change can, sometimes, even be directed or controlled.</p>
