        <p>Racing for only the third time in the United States, the Irish distance horse Elhayq outran eight rivals yesterday to win the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont Park by two and three-quarter lengths.</p>
        <p>Elhayq, a 5-year-old bay owned by the Shadwell Stable and trained by Kieran McLaughlin, stalked the leaders until they reached the homestretch and then flew to the front and finished far ahead of Yankee Dollar, who saved second place by a neck over Carpenter's Halo. The favorite, Drama Critic, finished fifth, less than a length in front of the second favorite, Epistolaire.</p>

        <p>Racing for only the third time in the United States, the Irish distance horse Elhayq outran eight rivals yesterday to win the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont Park by two and three-quarter lengths.</p>
        <p>Elhayq, a 5-year-old bay owned by the Shadwell Stable and trained by Kieran McLaughlin, stalked the leaders until they reached the homestretch and then flew to the front and finished far ahead of Yankee Dollar, who saved second place by a neck over Carpenter's Halo. The favorite, Drama Critic, finished fifth, less than a length in front of the second favorite, Epistolaire.</p>
        <p>Elhayq ran the mile and three-eighths on the grass in 2:13 4/5 under Shaun Bridgmohan, returned $32 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000. McLaughlin said he was considering the Sword Dancer at Saratoga on Aug. 12 for his next start.</p>
        <p>''He did have a perfect trip,'' McLaughlin said. ''Shaun sat in behind horses and rode a perfect trip. I think the key was the Lasix. I didn't know he was a bleeder. He bled once in Europe. So we put him on Lasix for his next start, and now he's 2 for 2 on Lasix. He definitely wants to run all day.''</p>
        <p>Bridgmohan agreed that the trip was carefree, and added: We ducked in behind the speeds turning for home, and then he just exploded. He really accelerated in midstretch, and I knew no one was going to catch him.</p>
        <p>Mike Smith, who replaced Jerry Bailey as the rider on Drama Critic because Bailey dealt with kidney stones all week, said: ''Everything was fine until we kicked for home. He just wasn't there. I know he's a much better horse than that.''</p>
        <p>Mark Hennig, who trains Drama Critic, reported that the horse ''jumped something into the first turn and after that lost his confidence.''</p>
