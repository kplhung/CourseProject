        <p>THOUGH ''The Perfect Storm'' is just now swamping theaters near you, a still more awesome, irresistible, force of nature threatens movie audiences not just this summer, but every summer. With monsoon-like predictability, the fierce winds, towering waves and torrential rains of movie hype roll in from California every year at about this time.</p>
        <p>Ever since those legendary days, a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, when ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'' showed the film industry a bold, new way to convince kids to see films over and over again during the summer, hype has become its own industry. Those colossal promotional campaigns that studios create to sell their films include the repetitive cover stories in glossy  magazines, newspaper and television coverage (including the E! cable channel, the last letter in hype) and blanket advertising.</p>
        <p>Studios usually spend one and a half times the production budget of a movie on publicity, and with the average summer picture costing close $70,000,000, that's real money.</p>
        <p>Since 1975, the year in which ''Jaws'' ate the box office, the number of summer releases has grown enormously, and the studios have had to become more savvy about luring moviegoers into the theaters. Today, hype can even be subtle, for hype. This usually occurs toward the end of the summer, as it did with last year's ''The Sixth Sense.'' The trailers for that spare tale didn't give away the surprise ending, and ''I see dead people'' became part of the cultural landscape.</p>
        <p>''The Blair Witch Project,'' which cost under $50,000 to make, was hustled via a constantly evolving Internet campaign. Artisan, the releasing studio, ingeniously saw that the Web could be used to speak directly to an audience that is resistant to standard forms of hype. Instead, they employed what could only be called e-hype, and spent a ton doing so.</p>
        <p>Mostly, however, subtlety is something summer moviegoers have to do without. Relief, such as it is, generally comes from the opposite direction, when a movie reaches such a peak of awfulness as to become the Bummer of the Summer. It's the picture for which the hype is so incessant that you feel beaten into attending. These are the films that almost everybody goes to and no one seems to like. The stench of stale air conditioning lends itself to the depression that settles in as the picture starts. Play some of these titles over in your mind as a kind of refresher course: ''Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace''; ''Batman''; ''Armageddon''; ''Batman Forever''; ''Mission Impossible''; ''Lethal Weapons 2-4''; ''Batman and Robin''; ''Con Air''; ''The Wild, Wild West.'' Perhaps that dull ache at the temples you felt sitting through these films is now returning -- a final gift from ''Twister.''.</p>
        <p>The observant can spot the telltale signs, the subtle warnings of a high level of movie awfulness: constant, incomprehensible action in the trailers; actors in independent films appearing in movies whose latte budgets probably exceed the entire budget of, say, ''Rushmore''; anything ''based upon'' a comic book character; magazine articles entirely about a movie's ''dazzling'' special effects.</p>
        <p>On occasion, something special comes along, something like ''Battlefield Earth,'' a picture that extends the boundaries of the horrible in such significant fashion that the title should be added to the synonyms for bad in the Oxford English Dictionary. Such cathartic experiences, movies that bring the few members of the audiences together, are, however, few and far between.</p>
        <p>The other contender for the Bummer title this summer, though admittedly coming in a poor second to ''Battlefield Earth,'' is ''Mission: Impossible 2,'' which continues the tradition established by the first one, a movie that still has people scratching their heads in puzzlement. ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' is vying for the title, too, and there are those who may even place ''Perfect Storm,'' with its emphasis on the world's deadliest water park special effects in lieu of characterization, in this category.</p>
        <p>THIS summer may be the first in three years in which attendance and box office figures started out a little down from the previous year. Then the five-day Fourth of July weekend came along with a slate of movies including ''Perfect Storm'' and ''Patriot,'' which made the summer of 2000 competitive with previous years.</p>
        <p>So the hype is with us and working its magic, and the nation is where it should be, in its seats, feet sticking to soda spilled on the floor, looking up at Hollywood's big, bright vision of the world. There is something reassuring about it all -- finding cool refuge in the dog days, watching the bad movies the hucksters have been ballyhooing for months.</p>
