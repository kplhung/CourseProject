        <p>IF any old master exudes a singular detachment from the world, both this one and the next, surely it is Vermeer: not for him were great tableaus inspired by the Bible or Greek mythology, or portraits of monarchs or emperors, or even oils of the powerful Dutch burghers of his day. Rather, to judge by his 30 or so surviving paintings, Vermeer preferred to express his fascination with color and light in domestic scenes of extraordinary intimacy, with at most a letter, being read or written, suggesting a world beyond the window.</p>
        <p>In other words, it would take a mighty dose of imagination to turn Johannes Vermeer into the stuff of dramatic opera.</p>
        <p>Peter Greenaway, the experimental British movie director, and Louis Andriessen, the Minimalist Dutch composer, have taken up the challenge. Focusing on two weeks in May 1672 when Vermeer made a rare trip away from his home in Delft to The Hague, they surmise that he was kept abreast of family news by letters from his wife, mother-in-law and model. They also presume that, while in The Hague, he sensed the crisis gripping the Dutch Republic as it prepared to breach the country's dikes to hold off invasion by France. By confronting Vermeer's domestic tranquility with the turbulence of his times, then, Mr. Greenaway and Mr. Andriessen found something to work with.</p>
        <p>The resulting 100-minute opera, ''Writing to Vermeer,'' first presented by the Netherlands Opera in Amsterdam's Muziektheater in December, will have its American premiere at the New York State Theater on Tuesday when it opens Lincoln Center Festival 2000. The festival, now in its fifth year, will offer 108 performances of 29 musical, theatrical, dance and other events through July 30, including three additional performances of ''Writing to Vermeer'' on July 13, 14 and 15. A separate program, Peter Greenaway on Screen, is also showing a handful of his best-known movies, including ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' through Wednesday at Makor on West 67th Street.</p>
        <p>The new opera, which might be called a work for music, screen and water, is above all a feast for the eyes, no novelty perhaps for Mr. Greenaway, whose recent movies include such visual fantasies as ''Prospero's Books,''  ''The Pillow Book'' and ''8 1/2 Women.'' Indeed, in 1994, in his first operatic collaboration with Mr. Andriessen, ''Rosa: A Horse Drama'' (renamed ''Rosa: The Death of a Composer'' in a recent recording released by Nonesuch Records), Mr. Greenaway concocted an equally bizarre stage-and-screen spectacle around the story of a composer of music for Westerns who falls in love with his horse.</p>
        <p>''Writing to Vermeer,'' which was generally well received by Dutch and other European critics, also began with a visual inspiration, specifically when Mr. Greenaway, known for his fascination with the 17th century, visited the Vermeer retrospective in The Hague in 1996. Once again intrigued by the beguiling and timeless mood of the paintings, he came up with the idea for a musical stage work built around 18 fictional letters -- six from each of the women in the artist's life -- sent to Vermeer during his brief absence from home, a work initially conceived as ''an opera without drama,'' a chamber piece on the same scale as the paintings.</p>
        <p>''I then suggested that it might be possible to make the piece more large-scale while still retaining a sense of intimacy,'' Mr. Andriessen, 61, explained in the production's program notes. ''We could provide 'windows' that break into the domesticity and serenity of Vermeer's home life and thus allow the viewer to see what was really going on in the world at the time.''</p>
        <p>FOR the Dutch, at least, 1672 was a tumultuous year. A century of prosperity had enabled the United Provinces, as the Dutch republic was then known, to shake off Spanish rule and emerge as an international naval and trading power. But the republic's elder statesman, Johan de Witt, and his brother, Cornelius, had just been lynched by a mob in The Hague for trying to negotiate peace with the French invaders. And if the breaching of the dikes seemed like a military stroke of genius, it brought on economic disaster. For many historians, 1672 marked the end of the Dutch Golden Age.</p>
        <p>To add still more drama, the opera uses large screens, placed behind and at times on the stage, to remind viewers of traumatic moments from earlier years, notably the crash of the speculative tulip market, the gunpowder explosion that destroyed a good part of Delft and religious riots in many Dutch cities. Just as the ''windows'' bring in a world far more disturbing than anything that the painter chose to record, the staging and music of ''Writing to Vermeer'' provide the drama absent in the libretto.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenaway's fascination with blood, apparent in ''Rosa: A Horse Drama'' and its grisly abattoir scenes, now leads him to cover performers with the blood of the De Witt brothers. Saskia Boddeke, who directed the production with Mr. Greenaway and did much of the actual staging, in turn displays a typical Dutch interest in water and dikes: she places the sloping stage above a pool of water, water runs down the stage and it also buckets down from above.</p>
        <p>There are more domestic liquids, too: the ink of the letters to Vermeer (they frequently appear on screen as they are being written); the varnish accidentally drunk by one of Vermeer's 10 children; and the milk poured by a kitchen maid in a momentary tableau vivant of ''The Milkmaid,'' one of Vermeer's most loved paintings (and naturally, many of the costumes designed by Emi Wada that also mirror Vermeer oils). Put differently, a lot of visual distraction is cooked up onstage.</p>
        <p>As in Amsterdam, Catherina Bolnes, Vermeer's doting wife, will be sung in New York by Susan Narucki; Maria Thins, his mother-in-law, by Susan Bickley; and Saskia de Vries, his model, by Barbara Hannigan. The Asko and Schonberg Ensembles, two Dutch contemporary music groups, will be conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw, himself chief conductor of the Schonberg Ensemble.</p>
        <p>The libretto, written in English and presented in New York with English supertitles, is divided into six scenes (without intermission) and comprises nothing more than the six letters sung by each of the three soprano leads, along with a few asides by two children onstage and a six-woman chorus in the orchestra pit. No male voices are heard and Vermeer himself replies to none of the letters.</p>
        <p>The letters, chatty in tone, offer news, gossip and loving doses of nostalgia for the absent painter. The biggest development is perhaps word that Saskia (herself a character invented by Mr. Greenaway) has been summoned home by her father, who wants to see her married, so her letters are sent from Dordrecht. Writing from Delft, Catherina jokes saucily about Saskia's ''kissable lips'' (''And I know you have thought the same''), but also reports with alarm that ''Cornelia has swallowed varnish.'' Maria, Vermeer's mother-in-law, flirts and flatters (''You see, no sooner you are away than we want you back'').</p>
        <p>With images of familiar Vermeer paintings appearing on screens, the letters also include such pointed references to Vermeer the artist as: ''The way you narrow your eyes when you stare so hard into the light'' (Catherina) and ''You paint us all writing so often -- we get into the habit and cannot stop'' (Maria) and ''I sit here in the sunlight from the window'' (Saskia).</p>
        <p>''The letters have been conceived to infer the possibility of a supposed domestic idyll,'' Mr. Greenaway writes in the program. ''In the later Vermeers, from the evidence of the paintings to be used in the opera, the women sit and talk, play music, weigh pearls, try on a pearly necklace, pour milk, crochet lace, write and read letters. They are treated with dignity. There is no adverse critical perspective, no attempt to sexually objectify the women, no attempt to titillate the women for the male gaze.''</p>
        <p>To the central trio of women, Ms. Boddeke has added a dozen more, both to people the stage and to respond as a choreographic ensemble to the disturbing news reaching the household. More puzzlingly, she has also created three versions of Catherina, Maria and Saskia, all dressed alike, although only one of each sings. But since all the singers wear hidden head-microphones, the result is that the audience cannot always identify which character is actually singing on a crowded stage.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't my idea,'' Mr. Andriessen said, ''and I don't really like it. But Saskia wanted to have the singers running around the stage, so you needed the head mikes. It also made it easier to integrate the pre-recorded music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andriessen has incorporated excerpts of electronic music composed and prerecorded by Michael van der Aa to symbolize moments when the real world disrupts the ''domestic idyll.'' While Stravinskian undertones typical of Mr. Andriessen's work often surface, his own score for ''Writing to Vermeer'' is also full of conscious references to other composers: he said he borrowed some musical structures from John Cage's ''Six Melodies'' for violin and piano and his ''Sixteen Dances'' and he adopted some melodies from a work by the 17th-century Dutch composer Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck.</p>
        <p>There are also hidden influences. ''Although I do not think it is audibly perceptible from the music,'' Mr. Andriessen said, ''I did often think about Ravel when I was writing this opera. He is the best example if you are striving to dress simple ideas in a beautiful and refined way. But by far the most important motivation for writing the music in the way I did was my love for Vermeer's paintings. That is what it is all about, and -- if you do your very best -- then perhaps you can succeed in creating something, albeit an approximation, that is just as beautiful as the paintings.''</p>
        <p>Yet, no doubt frustratingly for Mr. Andriessen, critical reaction to ''Writing to Vermeer'' to date has tended to depend on whether the reviewer loves or hates Mr. Greenaway's work. Just as Mr. Greenaway's movies provoke sharply contradictory responses, the opera drew sharp criticism from some European critics, notably Andrew Clark of The Financial Times of London, who complained about ''voices disembodied by amplification.''</p>
        <p>''On top of that,'' he wrote, ''Greenaway can't resist illustrating every line of text with repetitive film footage and choreographic routines, all thrown together in a sprawling jumble. There's no sense of individual character, no development from one scene to the next. What 'Writing to Vermeer' amounts to is a very expensive and very tedious charade.''</p>
        <p>Still, Dutch newspaper critics did single out Mr. Andriessen's ''tender and quite lyrical music,'' as Erik Voermans put it in Parool. In general, they also praised the production, with Kasper Jansen in NRC Handelsblad speaking of its ''extraordinarily beautiful and occasional images of old Dutch life.'' Roland DeBeer, in Volkskrant, described the music as ''masterful'' but noted that ''for spectators without a diploma in art history, it was hard to identify all the various characters as they danced, sat down, read and wrote, hunted around, blew out candles and played the harpsichord.''</p>
        <p>And for some British critics, everything seemed quite perfect. ''Greenaway creates continuous magic on the operatic stage,'' Adrian Mourby wrote in The Independent of London. And in The Guardian, Andrew Clements, who loved ''Rosa: A Horse Drama,'' considered the new opera ''a far more substantial achievement.'' And he added: ''What is most impressive is the perfect integration of all the elements in the work: how Greenaway has been able to carry over so much of his cinematic technique into his stage pictures; how Andriessen's music fleshes out the characterizations; and how everything is superbly realized in the theater.''</p>
        <p>The result is to throw light, albeit speculative light, on the mysterious figure of Vermeer. From his paintings, it is hard to get a sense of the man, yet here he is brought to life by the women who knew and loved him. There is no social or political reference in his work, yet this opera argues persuasively that he painted his ''domestic idylls'' as a response to agitated times. In fact, in the end, he does not have to appear onstage: he is ever present anyway.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 16, 2000, Sunday  An article on July 9 about Peter Greenaway's opera ''Writing to Vermeer'' at Lincoln Center Festival 2000 misidentified the singer in the role of Maria Thins, Vermeer's mother-in-law. It is Kathryn Harries, not Susan Bickley. A music listing misidentified the director of the production. It is directed by Saskia Boddeke and Mr. Greenaway, not Robert Wilson.</p>
