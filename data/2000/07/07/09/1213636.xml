        <p>More worker-starved businesses are finding that the best way to attract qualified employees is to let them stay home.</p>
        <p>The ability to telecommute -- whether from a home office or the kitchen -- is a key perk that helps companies recruit new employees and retain existing staff. At least that was the view of 62 percent of the 200 human resource professionals surveyed recently by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the outplacement firm.</p>
        <p>Eighty percent of the executives said that the current labor market was difficult, but that they still managed to find workers. Ten percent said the situation was severe, leaving them at risk of turning away business, while 5 percent said conditions were the worst they had ever seen. Only 5 percent said they had an easier time finding workers than they did a year ago.</p>
        <p>More than 19.6 million people reported working as telecommuters in 1999, according to the International Telework Association and Council, an industry group in Washington. The number is expected to grow this year.</p>
        <p>John A. Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger, Gray, said the labor shortage was ''clearly the single biggest issue for most employers today,'' which is why workplace trends like telecommuting, along with more unusual perks like pet insurance and employee nap rooms, have flourished in recent years.</p>
