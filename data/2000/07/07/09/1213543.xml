It's the return of the superhero. Holy do-gooders in tights -- or leather.</p>
        <p>What Are Friends For?</p>
        <p>It's Superspoof! An unauthorized parody of the popular ''Whassup?'' Budweiser ads has been flying around the Internet like Wonder Woman's invisible plane. Footage from the fondly remembered 1973 cartoon series ''Super Friends,'' which featured members of the Justice League and two shape-shifting kids, has been married to the beer soundtrack. We discover that Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Superman and Wonder Woman are not as busy as they used to be. So just what are those superheroes doing in the Hall of Justice these days? ''Watching the game. Having a Bud.'' The sendup can be found at www.adcritic.com/content/cartoon-network-true-wazzup.html.</p>
