        <p>WHEN Luz Albino's landlord decided to raise the rent on her Yonkers apartment to $700 a month from $650 last year, it was too much for Ms. Albino, a single mother, to manage.</p>
        <p>As a new employee of the county's Department of Social Services who had recently moved off public assistance, Ms. Albino's salary of about $25,000 a year could barely meet her expenses, let alone manage a rent increase.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albino had even been withholding rent because of disputes with the landlord about repairs to the apartment and was facing eviction.</p>
        <p>Enter the Bridge Fund of Westchester. The nonprofit organization, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and is based here, works to prevent homelessness by offering modest loans to people to keep them in current housing.</p>
        <p>''Prevention is the best cure,'' said Stanley Schear, the organization's executive director. ''We provide a service to people in crisis. And people in crisis are the least likely to know about their entitlements, like senior citizen exemptions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shear added: ''We're saving tax money, which conservatives like, and we're stopping human suffering, which liberals like. Our average loan per client is $1,100 to $1,200, with a ceiling of $2,000. If the county has to pay for shelter, it's $3,000 per month.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albino, the mother of a 17-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, had been referred to the Bridge Fund by the employee assistance program at her job. She has been working with counselors there to handle her budget and make better choices.</p>
        <p>''I needed to find another apartment, and I had no money,'' she said. ''I needed the security deposit and my first month's rent. The Bridge Fund helped me.''</p>
        <p>In addition to a loan, the Bridge Fund put her in touch with an organization that provided her with Christmas presents last December. Her new one-bedroom apartment is more affordable at $600.</p>
        <p>During nine years on welfare, Ms. Albino had lived in some of the county's homeless shelters and transitional housing. She found that the loss of affordable day care for her son once she was off public assistance, combined with other expenses, made her budget a challenge. ''I had to start from scratch,'' she said. ''I needed furniture, pots and pans, as well as shoes and clothes for work. There were a lot of expenses.''</p>
        <p>The Bridge Fund also steers people to other government agencies and nonprofit groups for assistance, like emergency shelter grants. No one can walk into the Bridge Fund's office unless there is a referral from a social worker, elected official or other  professional. Most clients come from the county's urban areas, although there are a few from the smaller villages and hamlets in the north.</p>
        <p>Veronica Parks, the executive director, said that while most clients have different problems, they share some things.</p>
        <p>Typically, a client is a working single parent, whose income often means a choice between paying Westchester's high rents and other expenses.</p>
        <p>Currently, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $1,190 a month, which means that people should earn $20.63 an hour to be able to afford it.</p>
        <p>''These are people who are living paycheck to paycheck,'' Ms. Parks said. ''If the brakes fail on the car, or they have a medical emergency, or they have a day-care issue and can't get to work, there's a crisis. They usually have no reserves.''</p>
        <p>When the program started, there were more than 4,400 homeless people in the county; as of May, there were 2,887. Now recognized as a model for preventing homelessness, the Bridge Fund idea has been adopted by organizations in Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>In the past decade, the Bridge Fund has provided assistance to more than 3,200 people.</p>
        <p>Begun in 1990 by Nan and Oscar Pollock, with the Rev. Peter Larom, who was then  rector at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains, the organization adopted the mission of preventing homelessness by offering short-term, modest loans to keep people in their homes. Last year, the fund provided $324,604, which represented 232 loans and grants to about 665 people.</p>
        <p>''Once the Bridge Fund starts working with a client, the government agencies respond better,'' said Chuck Schorr Lesnick, a community builder for HUD in New York City. ''It's a wonderful program, where there's a sense of shared responsibility. A high percentage of their clients pay the loans back.''</p>
