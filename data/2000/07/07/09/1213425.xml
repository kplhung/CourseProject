        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anyone who knows us -- or has heard our first single, ''Hillbilly Shoes,'' which is about knowing people rather than judging them -- knows that the last thing we do is define people we don't know by stereotype, appearance or especially where they're from. Having grown up playing music in a lot of barrooms, we've seen a lot of life and we've learned that snap judgments based on those things are too easy and often wrong.</p>
        <p>For Neil Strauss to say that we don't like his kind shows him to be the very kind of person he says we are. We're about real life, hard work, having fun when it's all said and done and, most important, standing up for what you believe in, especially respecting others.</p>

        <p>Life's short. We don't preach. We don't judge. Nor we do we like being judged on a bias by someone who's never hung out with us. We'd probably like Neil Strauss, if he were man enough to come out on the bus with us. And you know what? He might even have a good time.</p>
        <p>EDDIE MONTGOMERY and TROY GENTRY  Lexington, Ky.</p>
