        <p>IT'S perhaps an understatement to say that the films of Peter Greenaway are not fashionable at the moment. The 1980's were the director's moment in the art-film spotlight -- specifically, the period bounded by ''The Draughtsman's Contract'' (1982), whose Restoration-era cruelty was interpreted as a sneak attack on Thatcherite England, and ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'' (1989), which summed up the whole glittery decade as a Jacobean revenge melodrama set in a swank restaurant.</p>
        <p>The 1990's, by contrast, were a hard slog. Starting with 1991's ''Prospero's Books'' -- a fantasia on Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' that featured Sir John Gielgud in the title role -- Mr. Greenaway's work became increasingly dense, allusive and verbose. While his fellow British filmmakers were turning to the au courant flash of ''Trainspotting'' or the improvised social realism of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, he was creating savagely baroque tableaus that enraged the few audiences that saw them. ''The Baby of Macon'' (1993) was passed over for a United States release after repelling European moviegoers with an excruciating 10-minute, one-take scene in which the character played by Julia Ormond is graphically gang raped. His most recent film, ''8 1/2 Women,'' was booed at Cannes in 1999 and earned largely negative reviews during its theatrical release last month in this country. It's a mark of how low Mr. Greenaway's stock as a filmmaker has fallen that ''Writing to Vermeer,'' a new opera on which he has collaborated with the composer Louis Andriessen and the co-director Saskia Boddeke, is receiving a high-profile staging this month at the 2,700-seat New York State Theater as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, while the related series ''Peter Greenaway on Film'' is playing for eight days (through Wednesday) at the nearby Makor screening room -- which seats 72.</p>

        <p>The 1990's, by contrast, were a hard slog. Starting with 1991's ''Prospero's Books'' -- a fantasia on Shakespeare's ''Tempest'' that featured Sir John Gielgud in the title role -- Mr. Greenaway's work became increasingly dense, allusive and verbose.

''The Baby of Macon'' (1993) was passed over for a United States release after repelling European moviegoers with an excruciating 10-minute, one-take scene in which the character played by Julia Ormond is graphically gang raped. His most recent film, ''8 1/2 Women,'' was booed at Cannes in 1999 and earned largely negative reviews during its theatrical release last month in this country. It's a mark of how low Mr. Greenaway's stock as a filmmaker has fallen that ''Writing to Vermeer,'' a new opera on which he has collaborated with the composer Louis Andriessen and the co-director Saskia Boddeke, is receiving a high-profile staging this month at the 2,700-seat New York State Theater as part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, while the related series ''Peter Greenaway on Film'' is playing for eight days (through Wednesday) at the nearby Makor screening room -- which seats 72.</p>
        <p>That may be the number of people left willing to experience films so intellectually demanding and so resolutely not ''nice.'' Yet let it be said that this series -- despite at least two major omissions -- makes a case for the director as one of the most distinctive, and, yes, rewarding minds working in film. It shows how his filmography divides neatly into three chronological categories. And, by offering the long arc of a career, it suggests that Peter Greenaway may finally be coming to terms with himself, as both man and misanthrope.</p>
        <p>To moviegoers accustomed to the art-terrorism of ''The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' the most eye-opening entry in the series may be the evening of Greenaway's early short films. Made under the auspices of the British Film Institute while the nascent director was working by day in the government's Central Office of Information, compiling film footage on aspects of British industry and agriculture for classroom use, the shorts are droll avant-garde pseudo-documentaries. ''Windows'' (1974) juxtaposes images of a bucolic countryside with voice-over statistics about window-accident fatalities; the soundtrack to ''Water Wrackets'' (1978) describes a fantastical alternate-history saga of conquest, lake-building and decline over soothing shots of flowing brooks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenaway's private obsessions reappear throughout the shorts, making them, in a sense, pearls on a single strand. Numbers, birds and shaggy-dog anecdotes of miscommunication keep popping up, as well as fictitious characters like the disreputable owl-keeper Van Hoyten and the heroic short-story writer and ornithologist Tulse Luper. Above all, these films betray the filmmaker's original calling as a painter: of ''A Walk Through H'' (1978), which lays a Phillip Glass score and a nattering audio track about an unfathomable journey over 92 abstract ''maps,'' Greenaway has said ''the paintings came first, the film second.''</p>
        <p>The real shock, given the movies to come, is how funny these shorts are -- they bristle with deadpan wit and Carrollian wordplay. The approach reached its zenith in Greenaway's first feature in 1980, ''The Falls,'' which is, sadly, not a part of the Makor series (as with ''Baby of Macon,'' import VHS copies may be found in adventurous video stores). A nearly three-hour faux documentary concerning 92 selected survivors of a vague ecological catastrophe (described only as the ''Violent Unknown Event''), ''The Falls'' is a work of staggering imagination, and it both serves as a Baedeker to the director's playful fetishes (birds, Tulse Luper and water imagery are present) and suggests what might happen if Borges, Brian Eno and the Monty Python gang collaborated on a BBC project.</p>
        <p>''The Falls'' was Mr. Greenaway's farewell to his early style. In 1982, he took a sharp turn into deceptively conventional narrative with ''The Draughtsman's Contract,'' and was rewarded with the critical hosannas that often come to an ''overnight discovery.'' The tale of a 17th-century artist (portrayed by Anthony Higgins) hired by the wife (Janet Suzman) of a wealthy businessman to draw pictures of their estate, it touches on the director's interests in art and landscape design. For the first time, however, Mr. Greenaway delves into the social and sexual cruelties that have been his hobbyhorse ever since. The artist agrees to the job in exchange for sexual favors from the wife, but his control erodes when the businessman's body is found and the nobility begins to circle in for the kill. It's ''Blow-Up'' in perukes, to be sure, but the delicately nasty vision of class warfare -- Merchant-Ivory with barely sheathed claws -- made ''Contract'' an exemplary film for its time. It holds up as an arch, intriguing puzzle-piece.</p>
        <p>Some of the old obsessions resurfaced in Mr. Greenaway's next two features, but a chill was beginning to set in. ''A Zed and Two Noughts'' (1985) was an inquisition into grief, decay and the number two, as twin zoologists (brothers Brian and Eric Deacon) cope with their wives' deaths in an auto accident by creating time-lapse films of decomposing organisms from apples to zebras. Van Hoyten reappears from the short films (now played by Joss Ackland and trafficking in illegal animal corpses), but the earlier sense of play has been replaced by a clinical remove -- it's the first of the director's films to feature thoroughly unerotic full-frontal nudity. ''Drowning by Numbers'' (1988), on the other hand, may be the most emotionally warm item in Mr. Greenaway's catalog. This may be surprising when you consider that it's about a trio of husband-murdering women (all named Cissy Colpitts and played by Joan Plowright, Juliet Stevenson and Joely Richardson), but the country setting and a wearily wise take on the gender wars (Mr. Greenaway's view: men don't stand a chance) make ''Numbers'' the director's equivalent of a pastoral.</p>
        <p>Then came ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.'' Sex, bad behavior and haute-cuisine cannibalism guaranteed a ratings battle and the concomitant box-office stampede, and the film remains Greenaway's commercial peak (not to mention a high point in his collaboration with the cinematographer Sacha Vierny). It also marked the divide where his movies increasingly became staged tableaus -- outrageously detailed productions that pass before the audience's eyes as if unfurled from a rolling scrim. ''Cook'' remains essential viewing for its sets and costumes, for the elemental simplicity of its revenge plot, and above all for Michael Gambon's ferociously vulgar performance as the despicable Albert Spica -- but it led Mr. Greenaway directly into the cul-de-sac of his work in the 90's.</p>
        <p>This was the period in which his career expanded to stage productions (his first musical work, ''Rosa: A Horse Opera'' was mounted in 1994) and high-concept museum and citywide installations; the films look cluttered and secondary in comparison. Thankfully, the twittering, impenetrable ''Prospero's Books'' (1991) is not part of the Makor series; less felicitously, ''Baby of Macon'' (1993) is missing as well. Taking the form of a 12th-century passion play staged for the decadent 17th-century court of the Medicis -- with the walls between ''play'' and ''reality'' constantly breaking down -- ''Macon'' is both the twee ultimate example of Mr. Greenaway's new Baroque cinema and an unstinting assault on the complacency of audiences conditioned to the ''realistic'' Hollywood violence of Quentin Tarantino and Jerry Bruckheimer. Featuring nervy (and nude) performances by Ms. Ormond and Ralph Fiennes, the film is consciously fake in everything but its blistering anger; that it provoked anger in audiences is very probably what Greenaway intended.</p>
        <p>Instead, the series skips ahead to 1996's rather silly ''The Pillow Book,'' in which a Japanese supermodel (Vivian Wu) avenges her father by writing a diary on the body of her lover (Ewan McGregor), and in which Greenaway's taste for multiple images finally collapses into sensory overload. But the Makor screenings also give New York audiences a second chance to see ''8 1/2 Women'' -- and in this perspective, at least, the film stands out as something resembling a return to form.</p>
        <p>Like ''Drowning by Numbers,'' it's about the roles men force women into; unlike that film, ''Women'' is told from the man's point of view. Or men's: in the film, a jaded son (Matthew Delamere) coaxes his grieving widower father (John Standing) into creating a harem of women who fit various male fantasies, but their control over the situation quickly devolves, if it ever even existed. The film, typically, is as sexy as bread-mold; still, reviewers who compared ''8 1/2 Women'' to Fellini's ''8 1/2'' and found it lacking missed the point: Greenaway is interested in the booby-trapped space between desire and realization -- between head and hand -- and he probes that gulf with self-awareness and welcome humor. ''People do fantasize,'' he has said in defense of the film, ''but the fantasies are faulty, and there are problems and considerable male anxiety. The women tend to take the male dreams to a point of exhaustion.''</p>
        <p>THE Makor series stops at ''8 1/2 Women,'' but Mr. Greenaway's next project will continue to reach back, this time enlarging the imaginary territories of his earliest works. ''Tulse Luper's Suitcase'' (subtitled ''The Private History of Uranium 1928-1989'') will involve two four-hour films, 92 characters, multiple CD-ROMs and a 52-part television series. It will entail a Web site which is already up and running at www.tulseluper.net, and on which, during a recent online chat, Mr. Greenaway hinted that the new project would revisit many of the characters and topics of ''The Falls.'' It all sounds ridiculously ambitious, but perhaps the director will finally realize the monomaniacal multimedia vision he had in mind when he told a reporter from The London Independent last year, ''I see cinema being replaced by 360-degree theme parks.''</p>
        <p>Pretentious? Arrogant? Lord, yes. In truth, this filmmaker's love of high-art cross-referencing and distaste for anything even approaching sentiment combine to create an aesthetic pitched at a level that perhaps only dogs and charter subscribers to the Brooklyn Academy of Music can hear. Yet so utterly at home is Peter Greenaway in his pretensions that the ball is effectively lobbed back into our court, forcing us to either pierce his films' surface fripperies or walk away in bafflement and disgust. Either reaction may sit well with a director who once commented, ''I often thought it was very arrogant to suppose you could make a film for anybody but yourself.'' In an industry in which shameless pandering is the norm, such blithe elitism remains ennobling, self-defeating, unfashionable -- and not a little revolutionary.</p>
