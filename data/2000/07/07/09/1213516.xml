        <p>Recent rise in gasoline prices makes its worthwhile for taxpayers who deduct business mileage to consider relative advantages of taking standard rate allowed by IRS or calculating actual expense; standard-rate deduction requires only that taxpayer keep track of mileage, but same taxpayer may save more by taking trouble to calculate actual expense; photo (M)</p>

        <p>DESPITE recent signs of easing, high prices at the gas pump continue to stir political debate. They may also change the calculus for another, more personal question: Which method should taxpayers use when figuring deductions for business mileage: the standard rate or the actual-expense version?</p>
        <p>It is a decision that should be revisited whenever any of the relevant elements change, experts say. For the self-employed, the choice is especially important, though even employees who are reimbursed for their mileage can deduct expenses in excess of the reimbursement.</p>
        <p>Business mileage refers to any driving done for work other than commuting to and from the office -- trips to see clients, to courthouses or to meetings, for example.</p>
        <p>For years, the standard mileage rate --  the business expense allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for each mile driven for business -- has generally ticked up steadily but slowly, mirroring cost-of-living adjustments. The rate is a calculation of the average driver's auto-related expenses, including lease payments, depreciation, interest payments, insurance, gasoline, repairs and maintenance costs. The rationale is that while gas prices and other expenses may fluctuate, they have a relatively small impact on the overall cost of driving.</p>
        <p>That does not mean, however, that the standard mileage rate reflects the cost of driving for any individual driver. People who live in large cities, for example, spend more on insurance, while those who finance expensive cars pay more interest. And as gasoline prices climbed this year, Midwesterners paid higher prices than others. But everyone who chooses this method of accounting gets the same standard rate, though some small items, like parking and tolls, can be deducted separately.</p>
        <p>When the I.R.S. lowered the standard mileage rate last year, from 32.5 cents a mile to 31 cents as of April 1, it was a blow to those who thought the rate was already too low. And with pump prices up markedly since then, the actual-expense method bears extra consideration.</p>
        <p>''We calculate it both ways for our clients, and 99 percent of the time the actual expense provides a better tax deduction than the mileage rate they give you,'' said Howard Leitner, a partner at the accounting firm Leitner, Zander, Sniderman &amp; Company in Los Angeles. ''With rising gas prices, if you were on the border of whether you should take actual or standard, it will push you over to the actual-expense side.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the main benefit of using the standard rate is its simplicity. A taxpayer need keep records only of the miles driven for business in a given year.</p>
        <p>But when should savings trump ease? The only way to know the difference between the standard rate and actual expenses is to run the numbers. The calculation will include the number of business miles driven in a year and the amount spent on gasoline and other allowable costs for the portion of driving that relates to business.</p>
        <p>The standard rate is based on average car expenses, with an estimate for gasoline costs based on prices in the previous year -- currently, about $1.50 a gallon. This hardly does justice to prices spiking upward of $2.50 a gallon, as they did recently in many Midwestern cities. For a car that gets 20 miles to the gallon, a $1-a-gallon jump in gas prices means an increase of 5 cents a mile.</p>
        <p>''You could look at it as the I.R.S. cheating you by 5 cents a mile,'' said Gordon Klein, a tax lawyer and a lecturer at the Anderson School at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''It could add up.''</p>
        <p>For people who barely use their cars for business or who have extremely low car expenses, the extra effort of collecting receipts and calculating expenses will generally not produce enough savings to justify the work. Similarly, employees whose companies reimburse their business mileage may not receive a big benefit, because they can deduct only the actual expenses above the amount they are reimbursed. Most employers pay for mileage at the I.R.S. standard rate. In addition, the I.R.S. does not let employees claim the interest portion of car payments as an auto expense, so their allowable ''actual expenses'' will be lower than those for the self-employed.</p>
        <p>ACCOUNTANTS say the differences in savings tend to be biggest for people who are self-employed or who lease cars, or both.</p>
        <p>''If you're self-employed, it's a real issue because you're not getting anything if you don't take it on your tax return,'' said David Green, a partner in the personal financial services practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles. When they itemize, the self-employed may claim the interest portion of their car payments as an expense, along with all other annual costs of driving for business.</p>
        <p>Say a self-employed woman has a $35,000 car that is used 50 percent of the time for business. She can deduct actual expenses totaling 50 percent of her gasoline, insurance, interest and maintenance expenses.</p>
        <p>The car was financed at an interest rate of 8.49 percent, is driven a total of 12,000 miles in a year and gets 25 miles to the gallon in a metropolitan area where gasoline costs $1.75 a gallon.</p>
        <p>The business half of the expenses includes $750 for insurance, $1,374 for interest, $420 for gasoline and $250 for maintenance. The I.R.S. also considers depreciation an expense, though it is capped for all cars, no matter their cost, and is set at a different amount for each subsequent year of use.</p>
        <p>For cars first used for business in 1999, the cap that year was $3,060. (The cap for cars first used in 2000 has not yet been set.) In the example, that means a maximum of $1,530 (or 50 percent of $3,060) could be included as an expense. In this case, the driver would be allowed $1,530 for depreciation, bringing her total allowable expenses to $4,324.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the standard mileage rate of 31 cents a mile would let her deduct only $1,860.</p>
        <p>The gap between the calculations, of course, grows as fuel efficiency drops or as the price of gasoline jumps. Say the car in the example was a gas-guzzler, getting 15 miles to the gallon in a city where gas prices have risen to $2.50 a gallon. The vehicle's annual fuel costs would jump to $1,000, from $420, and total expenses would rise to $4,904, from $4,324. But the standard mileage rate would still allow for just $1,860.</p>
        <p>Big differences are also seen in the computations for leased cars. While there are no interest expenses or depreciation involved, lease payments may be included in the actual-expense calculation. So if that same gas-guzzler were leased, with annual payments of $3,800, the total actual expenses would be $5,800.</p>
        <p>If doing the extra math makes sense, remember that choosing the actual-expense method the first year a car is used for business obligates you to continue with it as long as you have that car. (If you choose the standard rate the first year, you may be able to switch to actual expenses in later years.)</p>
        <p>True, itemizing expenses can be an ordeal. But the tax savings gained through using the actual-expense method may, among other things, be one small way to feel better about the pain at the pump.</p>
        <p>One Way to Save: Burn Less Fuel</p>
        <p>CAN'T itemize business driving expenses to get back more of the high cost of gasoline from the tax collector? There are other ways to keep high pump prices from stinging quite so much.</p>
        <p>* Stick to the speed limit. Fuel efficiency drops markedly at high speeds, even for high-performance cars.</p>
        <p>* Switch to regular. Many drivers buy premium who do not need it. High-compression, high-horsepower engines must have the extra octane; for the rest, regular gas is just as good. The difference can be $3 or more for each fill-up.</p>
        <p>* Service the car. Changing the oil often -- say, every 3,000 miles -- and keeping the tires fully inflated will improve gas mileage.</p>
        <p>* Empty the trunk. Keep the spare, the jack and the emergency kit, of course, but that sack of sand for winter traction and the golf clubs you use twice a year can go, lightening the load on the engine.</p>
        <p>* Roll up the windows. At highway speeds, it generally takes less energy to run the air-conditioner than to fight the aerodynamic drag caused by open windows. (Around town, the opposite is true.)</p>
        <p>* Turn off the engine. Idling for longer than two or three minutes burns more fuel than restarting a typical car.</p>
        <p>* Cadge a lift. ''Hey, that's a beaut you've got in the driveway, Phil. Bet she rides great. What say we tool on down to the squash courts together in your car?''</p>
