        <p>The 71st Major League Baseball All-Star Game will be played Tuesday night at Turner Field in Atlanta. Through the years, the All-Star Game has been the vehicle for some of baseball's legendary accomplishments. Here is a highly eclectic lineup card of stellar highlights.</p>
        <p>All-Star Fever</p>
        <p>The first All-Star Game was staged in 1933, at Comiskey Park, in conjunction with Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition. The idea came from Arch Ward, sports editor of The Chicago Tribune.</p>
        <p>Ward persuaded the league owners to a game between stars from the American and National Leagues. Ward's proposal was for a one-time event, but the All-Star Game proved so popular, it has been played every year since -- except in 1945, when it was called off because of travel restrictions during World War II. (There were two All-Star Games from 1959 to 1962, to benefit the players' pension fund.)</p>
        <p>At the inaugural All-Star Game in 1933, Babe Ruth slammed the first home run in its history, a two-run shot off Wild Bill Hallahan to help the Americans capture a 4-2 victory over the Nationals.</p>
        <p>King Carl and Dr. K</p>
        <p>In 1934, at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants used his dazzling screwball to strike out five future Hall of Famers in a row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.</p>
        <p>In the 1984 game, Hubbell threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Candlestick Park in San Francisco to mark the 50th anniversary of his achievement. Then Hubbell watched as Fernando Valenzuela and 19-year-old Dwight Gooden, the youngest All-Star in the game's history, combined to break his record with six consecutive whiffs.</p>
        <p>All-Star Injuries</p>
        <p>St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Dizzy Dean sustained a broken toe when he was hit by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Earl Averill in the third inning of the 1937 game at Griffith Stadium in Washington.</p>
        <p>Dean, who at 26 had already won 134 career games and was on his way to another outstanding season in 1937, tried to come back too soon. He altered his delivery to favor the injury and ruined his arm. The next season, Dean was traded to the Chicago Cubs and his brief but brilliant career was never the same.</p>
        <p>In 1950, in the first All-Star Game to be broadcast on television, Boston's Ted Williams hurt his left elbow in the first inning while making a catch against the left-field wall at Comiskey Park. Williams, who stayed in the game and contributed a run-scoring single in the fifth inning, did not know that the elbow was broken until the following day. He was lost until the end of the season, as Boston finished four games back.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's Harmon Killebrew became another All-Star Game casualty in 1968 at Houston's Astrodome, in the first indoor contest and the first played on artificial turf. Killebrew, stretching for a throw at first base, tore a hamstring and missed two months.</p>
        <p>McCarthy Proves a Point</p>
        <p>American soldiers fighting the war in Europe followed the 1943 game by listening to the game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia on shortwave radio. An outfielder named DiMaggio was the hitting star, but the DiMaggio was Pittsburgh's Vince, who singled, tripled and homered.</p>
        <p>The American League pocketed its eighth victory in 11 games, despite having no Yankees in the lineup. Yankees Manager Joe McCarthy, defying critics who suggested the Junior Circuit could not win without his Yankees, refused to play any of his six players selected to the team. It was the only time in All-Star Game history that no Yankee got into the game.</p>
        <p>Williams Had a Blast</p>
        <p>The 1946 game at Boston's Fenway Park fittingly turned into the Ted Williams Show. Williams returned to baseball after three years at war in spectacular fashion. The Splendid Splinter set All-Star Game records with four hits, including two home runs, four runs scored and five runs batted in.</p>
        <p>The eighth-inning confrontation between Williams and Pittsburgh pitcher Rip Sewell would become one of the most unforgettable moments in All-Star Game memory. Sewell was the master of the ''eephus pitch,'' a high-arcing blooper pitch. When Sewell lobbed his infamous eephus, Williams blasted a three-run home run over the right-field wall, the first homer hit off the looping pitch. The Americans defeated the Nationals, 12-0, in the most lopsided shutout in All-Star Game competition.</p>
        <p>Legendary Winners</p>
        <p>Dean Stone of the Washington Senators and Stu Miller of the San Francisco Giants were winning pitchers overshadowed by circumstance.</p>
        <p>In 1954, Stone entered the game in the eighth inning in relief of Bob Keegan with two out and Red Schoendienst on third base. Before Stone's first delivery, Schoendienst attempted to steal home and was tagged out. When Larry Doby tied the game in the bottom of the inning with a homer and Nellie Fox drove in the game's final two runs with a bases-loaded single, Stone became the winning pitcher without throwing a pitch.</p>
        <p>According to legend, Miller was blown off the mound by the wind during one of the 1961 games at blustery Candlestick Park. The N.L. was leading, 3-2, with one out in the ninth and Miller pitching to Rocky Colavito with two men on base. When he took his set position, a fierce gust of wind blasted the 165-pound Miller, causing a slight wobble. The umpire called a balk to advance the runners, and the A.L. tied the score. When the N.L. won in the 10th, Miller was the winning pitcher, but the next day, ''Miller Blown Off Mound'' was the headline. ''I wasn't blown off that mound,'' Miller said. ''I just waved a little.''</p>
        <p>Vote Early and Often</p>
        <p>Fans selected the eight starting position players from 1947 to 1957. But partisan voting in 1957 brought about the demise of elected All-Star teams. Cincinnati fans stuffed the ballot boxes full of Reds and had apparently elected a starting squad of George Crowe at first base, Johnny Temple at second, Don Hoak at third, Roy McMillan at shortstop, Frank Robinson in left field, Gus Bell in center, Wally Post in right and Ed Bailey as catcher.</p>
        <p>Before the results were announced, Commissioner Ford Frick declared that Crowe, Bell and Post were disqualified as starters, selecting Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron in their place.</p>
        <p>This ballot stuffing by Cincinnati fans resulted in players, coaches and managers making the All-Star Game choices from 1958 to 1969.</p>
        <p>In 1970, the new commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, ruled that the selection of starting lineups be returned to the fans. But the flawed balloting system, sponsored by Gillette, named only six players at each position. Al Kaline, Detroit's perennial All-Star, was not listed on the ballot. Atlanta's Rico Carty, who sported a gaudy .428 batting average at the break, and California's Alex Johnson, the eventual A.L. batting champion, were not listed either.</p>
        <p>The game, played at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, which had opened only two weeks earlier, was the site for a stunning ending. The N.L. scored three runs in the ninth inning to tie the score. In the 12th, the Reds' Pete Rose thundered head-on into Cleveland catcher Ray Fosse and sent him crashing backward as Rose crossed the plate with the winning run. Fans would later vote Rose as the starter at five different positions, an All-Star Game record.</p>
        <p>Golden Anniversary</p>
        <p>In 1983, the Midsummer Classic returned to Comiskey Park, which was the site of the first All-Star Game 50 years earlier. In the third inning, Fred Lynn of the California Angels hit a grand slam off the Giants' Atlee Hammaker. It was Lynn's fourth All-Star home run and the first grand slam in All-Star history. Lynn's clout punctuated a seven-run inning as the A.L. coasted to a 13-3 victory and ended its embarrassing 11-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Bo Knows All-Star Games</p>
        <p>Bo Jackson of the Kansas City Royals received the most valuable player trophy in the 1989 game -- the first played with the designated hitter -- as he led the Americans to their first repeat victory in 31 years.</p>
        <p>Jackson, playing left field and batting leadoff for the first time in his brief major league career, blasted a 448-foot home run over the center-field fence at Anaheim Stadium off starter Rick Reuschel. The next batter, Wade Boggs, also homered, the first time in All-Star history that the first two batters in a game had homered. Nolan Ryan, at 42, became the oldest All-Star winning pitcher.</p>
        <p>The following year, Jackson, who also played running back for the Los Angeles Raiders, was named to the Pro Bowl, becoming the only athlete chosen to play in both the All-Star Game and the Pro Bowl.</p>
