        <p>Outsider art is folk, self-taught, naive or visionary, sometimes driven by psychological necessity. Many outsider artists are associated with rural areas, but several live and work in New York. Here are seven of them.</p>

        <p>Outsider art is folk, self-taught, naive or visionary, sometimes driven by psychological necessity. Many outsider artists are associated with rural areas, but several live and work in New York. Here are seven of them.</p>
        <p>CARLA CUBIT  Attorney Street, Lower East Side</p>
        <p>She speaks in a barely audible whisper, but her bold mixed-media sculptures, built with found objects, fairly shout. ''Some of it I have to buy, some of it my friends give me, some of it is recycled,'' she said of her materials. Ms. Cubit, 33, who was homeless for a year, found her creative calling through arts groups she encountered in shelters. She sees art as a way to distract herself. It allows her, she said, to ''concentrate on something else besides my life.''</p>
        <p>MICHAEL MADORE  Clinton Street, Cobble Hill, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>His family moved around a lot when he was a child. ''I started drawing little maps when I was 8 or 9,'' said Mr. Madore, 45, ''as a way to control places I was living in.'' He is still using art, he said, ''to organize my manic thoughts.'' He paints busy, colorful, mazelike pieces that he calls ''nervous.''</p>
        <p>JOSE ROSADO  Grand Concourse, Tremont, the Bronx</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosado, 43, has no formal art training, but he has been drawing since he was a child. ''When I was in school,'' he said, ''every kid was playing in the yard except me. I was sitting and drawing. That's what I like to do.'' His work is largely New York scenes: streets, bridges and skylines.</p>
        <p>IONEL TALPAZAN  West 135th Street, Harlem</p>
        <p>Since Ionel Talpazan, 44, emigrated to the United States from Romania in 1987, he has been making drawings, paintings and sculptures of unidentified flying objects. He said his artwork was based on an incident from his boyhood in Romania: he saw a blue flying saucer hovering in the sky.</p>
        <p>PHILIP TRAVERS  Upper West Side</p>
        <p>He has been fascinated by Egyptians for two decades. In 1983, said Mr. Travers, 86, he began studying with an artist, who told him to ''interact with Egyptians, rather than be an Egyptologist.'' King Tutankhamen became a theme in his color-pencil series, as did Alice in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat and Alfred Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>MELVIN WAY  Fort Washington Avenue, Washington Heights</p>
        <p>When Melvin Way, 46, was growing up, he played percussion and woodwind instruments; these days, his music is drawing. His intricate creations, like ''Untitled,'' (above), which he describes as ''microns'' or ''what can't be seen,'' are diagrams and patterns that often include chemical equations and scientific structures. He says one work demonstrates ''the prevention of cancer.''</p>
        <p>MALCAH ZELDIS  North Moore Street, TriBeCa</p>
        <p>The walls in Malcah Zeldis's apartment are crowded with framed paintings whose subjects include her wedding, Nazi Germany and the shooting death of Amadou Diallo. Ms. Zeldis, 68, began painting regularly 40 years ago, when her children were often out of the house for the whole day, and she was ''relatively free.'' That period, she said, was an ''incredible transformation for me. Everything I had ever seen became a subject for me.''</p>
