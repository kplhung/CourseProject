        <p>On the first day that they pitched on the same day against each other's team since they opposed each other in the 1986 World Series, Dwight Gooden returned to Shea Stadium yesterday afternoon and helped create a festive mood and Roger Clemens pitched at Yankee Stadium last night and created an ugly atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The contrast added spice to an already unusual split-borough doubleheader. Unfortunately for the Mets, they were losers on all counts.</p>
        <p>With Gooden pitching five surprisingly effective innings in his first game at his old home in six years, the Yankees won the Queens part of the doubleheader, 4-2.</p>
        <p>In the Bronx about four hours later, Clemens hit Mike Piazza, the Mets' No. 1 player, in the head in the second inning, knocking him down and out of the game with a slight concussion. The Yankees went on to win that game, too, also by 4-2.</p>
        <p>Clemens' 92 mile-an-hour fastball generated a palpable tension on the field, bringing all of the Mets to the top step of their third base dugout and stirring instant ill feeling between the teams. Afterward, the Mets expressed outrage over the pitch. Manager Bobby Valentine left no doubt that he believed Clemens hit Piazza purposely.</p>
        <p>''I think it was bull,'' he said. ''I think it was terrible. I hope someday he'll pitch in a National League park where we play against him.'' Pitchers have to bat in games played in N.L. parks.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, was aghast that anyone would think Clemens hit Piazza deliberately. ''I'd be dumbfounded if I'm sitting here,'' Torre said, ''and I know that Roger's throwing at somebody's head on purpose.''</p>
        <p>Clemens predictably professed innocence. Citing Piazza's good record against him (7 hits, including 3 home runs, in 12 at-bats), he said, ''That wasn't the way I wanted to get him out.'' He said he planned to pitch Piazza in, explaining that the pitch ''was supposed to be in and I wanted it belt high.''</p>
        <p>The Mets retaliated but relatively tamely. With his second pitch of the Yankees' half of the second, Glendon Rusch hit Tino Martinez on the beefiest part of his body, his rear end. No fight ensued, but the umpires warned both teams not to let it happen again, and it didn't as tempers cooled and the tension dissipated until after the game when it flared in words.</p>
        <p>The scene, witnessed by 55,821 fans at Yankee Stadium, was in marked contrast to the afternoon at Shea. There, before 54,165 fans, Gooden was celebrated by Yankees and Mets faithful alike. He was a fallen hero returned.</p>
        <p>''The key today,'' a still-excited Gooden said, ''was going down to the bullpen to warm up 30 minutes earlier to get the emotional stuff out of the way. The last couple days, it was more than I could imagine. Sitting home for three and a half weeks with no job, just waiting for the phone to ring, I just wanted to hear something. Now, getting the opportunity to wear a Yankee uniform and come back and pitch at Shea Stadium, it's just been overwhelming for myself. When I took the mound, I still had so many feelings about being out on that mound again and pitching against the Mets.''</p>
        <p>It was confusing, to say the least. The Yankees were playing the Mets at their park, and the pitcher who is one of the great players in Mets history was pitching for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Gooden was in that position because the Tampa Bay Devil Rays had released him May 25 and he had no assurance of getting another job. But he called the Yankees, and in the benevolent compassion that George Steinbrenner often shows for former employees, they signed him to a minor league contract.</p>
        <p>Four weeks later, the Yankees, frustrated over the failure of three rookies, summoned Gooden for an emotionally charged start.</p>
        <p>Gooden gave up two runs and six hits, walking one and striking out one. Billy Connors, the Yankees' minor league pitching guru, had said before the game he thought Gooden had ''about 90 pitches in him,'' and Gooden departed having thrown 77.</p>
        <p>The pitch that stung the most, however, was the bloop double Derek Bell hit in the fifth inning that tied the game, 2-2. In their younger days in Tampa, Fla., Gooden said, Bell was like a little brother to him.</p>
        <p>''He grew up in the house right next to me,'' said Gooden, 4 years older than Bell. ''I try not to make eye contact with him or pay any attention. Once he comes in to the box, he's just another hitter. When you face a guy like that, he's probably trying to take you deep.''</p>
        <p>Gooden jammed Bell, but Bell managed to bloop the ball beyond the reaching grasp of Chuck Knoblauch, who raced into short center field trying to catch the ball. After walking Edgardo Alfonzo, Gooden preserved the tie by retiring Piazza on a fly to deep center.</p>
        <p>''That's not a good feeling,'' Gooden said of his confrontation with Piazza, ''because you're thinking a decent day can be destroyed with one pitch. That was a situation where I had to feel this is my game right here. My game's on the line. All I had left was what I gave him.''</p>
        <p>Gooden did not hit Piazza in the head. He didn't have to; he was that effective for his part of the game.</p>
        <p>''The main thing was, I was consistent with throwing strikes,''he said, ''getting ahead of the hitters more often than I did earlier in the year. Earlier in the season, I was struggling with the command of my pitches, falling behind hitters ball one, ball two. That really set the table for me getting in trouble.''</p>
        <p>The trouble yesterday did not start until later, when Clemens punctuated the eagerly awaited doubleheader by nearly puncturing Piazza's head.</p>
