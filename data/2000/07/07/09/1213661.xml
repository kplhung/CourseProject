        <p>Late last month, First Union Corporation announced the closing of the Money Store, which offered secondary mortgages to people with bad credit. That has meant that more than 330 New Jersey employees are now out of a job. One of the three Money Store processing sites outside of its headquarters in Sacramento, Calif, was in Warren, with 140 employees, and another loan-processing office in Pennington with 190 employees, was also closed as was a sales office in Eatontown with around three employees.</p>
