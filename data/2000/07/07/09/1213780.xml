        <p>The Greatest Threat</p>
        <p>Iraq, Weapons of Mass Destruction,</p>
        <p>and the Crisis of Global Security.</p>
        <p>By Richard Butler.</p>
        <p>262 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>PublicAffairs. $26.</p>
        <p>Richard Butler now calls it a ''poisoned chalice.'' But in the beginning it was a job and a challenge like no other: to complete the disarmament of Saddam Hussein, one of the most menacing rulers in a century of tyrants. Butler assumed this task in 1997, more than six years after the Iraqis had been driven from Kuwait in the Persian Gulf war and nearly seven years after crippling sanctions had been imposed on the Iraqis. Yet Saddam seemed as determined as ever to cling to the most terrible weapons on earth -- biological toxins, chemical gases and the nuclear bomb.</p>
        <p>Butler seemed made for the job. He was a tough, plain-spoken Australian with a career in disarmament. Only a year earlier, as Australia's ambassador to the United Nations, he had outsmarted India to save the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty from premature death in an international conference. Perhaps it was because of these attributes that the Iraqis turned on him with a particular vehemence, employing all manner of diplomatic maneuvers and enlisting Baghdad's allies -- the Russians, the Chinese and, from time to time, the French -- to make his job unbearable. That, at least, is the story Butler tells in ''The Greatest Threat,'' his account of his two years as executive director of the United Nations Special Commission -- or Unscom, as the world came to know it.</p>
        <p>It is a story rich in vivid detail. Butler not only reveals the increasingly sham activities that passed for arms inspection before all pretense of monitoring Iraq ended with American and British bombing in December 1998; he also chronicles his run-ins with Iraqi officials, particularly Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, who repeatedly made an issue of Butler's rough, outspoken manner. By early 1999, his relations with Secretary General Kofi Annan all but ruptured, Butler saw little left to do except bide his time until his contract expired and he could leave the United Nations for a berth as diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he wrote this book.</p>
        <p>Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who created Unscom and served as its first executive chairman from 1991 to 1997, has yet to write his book about Iraq. So it cannot be known for certain whether Ekeus -- who once described his encounters with the Iraqi government as voyages into ''The Arabian Nights'' -- bailed out only because the Swedish government wanted to send him to Washington as its ambassador. Was he also eager to leave because he knew that the Iraqis, having been forced to declare huge stocks of lethal arms they earlier denied having, had decided they had had enough of the game of search and destroy? Whatever the case, it seems clear today that his successor was given command of a sinking ship.</p>
        <p>Butler stood out for his impatience with diplomatic dissimulation, a frank style that may have owed something to his working-class Australian background. The son of a landscape gardener and World War II veteran, he grew up in Bondi, near Sydney, and developed a fierce loyalty to the Australian Labor Party. He received his first lessons in international affairs at Bondi Beach, Australia's most famous surf, where he played with children whose parents had escaped Nazi terror. By the time he graduated from the University of Sydney in 1964, he had decided on a career in international relations and was soon sent to the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. After serving in several other diplomatic posts, including the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, he became Australia's first ambassador for disarmament.</p>
        <p>''The Greatest Threat'' does not rewrite the history of the world's relations with Saddam Hussein. Yet the book fills in many important gaps, identifying members of the Secretary General's entourage who struck Butler as being more concerned about respecting Iraqi sensitivities than about holding Saddam to his promises to disarm. He reserves special contempt for Staffan de Mistura, a senior United Natons official who flabbergasted Security Council members and journalists by claiming that Saddam's ostentatious palaces were much admired by Iraqis, who expected their leader to live in such splendor. Unscom inspectors thought some of these buildings were obvious hiding places for arms or for arms research facilities. But when they suggested kicking down the doors, they were haughtily dismissed as cowboys by United Nations officials who preferred a more genteel approach. ''The leadership of the U.N. had become a facilitator of Iraqi concealment,'' Butler concluded.</p>
        <p>Some arms control experts will fault Butler for glossing over the Clinton administration's role in the failure of Unscom. Although the administration banged the drums for tough controls on Iraq throughout the mid-90's, it fell all but silent by late 1997, when Butler needed support most. Security Council solidarity crumbled, and Iraq, with Russian and French support, moved into the vacuum. In late 1998 and early 1999, American officials leaked information about the use of Unscom by the United States as a cover to conduct spying of its own. This was exactly what Saddam Hussein was waiting to hear. Butler maintains that the sharing of intelligence with the United States and other countries predated his arrival at Unscom, and Ekeus attests to that. But this does not undo the damage done to Unscom's reputation.</p>
        <p>Butler's experience in Iraq has made him deeply pessimistic. ''When a determined criminal flouts international law under the principle of state sovereignty,'' he writes, ''the world system, as currently constituted, appears unable or unwilling to stop him.'' His book is a primer on the difficulties of enforcing any international arms control agreement when a country believes it is not in the national interest to comply. It doesn't have to be Iraq. It could be France or, for that matter, the United States.</p>
        <p>In his final chapter, Butler expresses concern about Washington's abandonment of leadership in international arms control. For the moment, the politics of an election year have removed Iraq, and indeed most arms control issues besides antimissile defense, from public debate. Washington is not pressing Saddam Hussein to allow the newly established arms inspection team to resume work in Iraq. The United States, Butler argues, must reclaim the leadership in disarmament that it had after World War II. In the meantime, he reminds us, ''No one is watching Saddam Hussein.''</p>
