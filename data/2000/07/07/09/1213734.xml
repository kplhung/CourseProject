        <p>Marion Kirby, a Rye resident who is 107 years old, will preside over 150 members of her very extended family Saturday at a reunion of eight generations of the Kirby clan. The event, which is expected to draw Kirbys-by-birth and Kirbys-by-marriage from across the country, will take place at the Rye Recreation Center, not far from the house in which Mrs. Kirby still lives. It was organized by Thomas J. Maloney Jr., one of Mrs. Kirby's grandsons, Elaine Taylor O'Neill, one of her nieces, both of Rye; and Kirby Scollon, a nephew who lives in New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>The Kirby family came directly to Rye when it emigrated from Ireland in the 1840's, Mr. Scollon explained.</p>

        <p>The Kirby family came directly to Rye when it emigrated from Ireland in the 1840's, Mr. Scollon explained.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen Kirbys still live in Rye, but as the family grew, others moved elsewhere. ''Marion is the last of her generation,'' Mrs. O'Neill said. ''My generation is dying off, too. So we hope that this gathering will give the younger ones, the children, a chance to really get to know each other better.''</p>
