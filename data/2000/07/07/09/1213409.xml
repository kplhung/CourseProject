        <p>IN the Hamptons, the right of public access to ocean beaches is rooted in a Colonial patent that recalls a time when certain shore fronts were thoroughfares for livestock.</p>
        <p>The beaches remain open to everyone, but getting to them can be difficult. Long stretches are lined with private property, and most town and village beaches and parking areas give preference to or only allow residents.</p>
        <p>This pattern, typical of many coastal communities, was to have undergone a sea change on the Westhampton barrier island, which stretches 15 miles from Shinnecock Inlet to Moriches Inlet, because of a publicly financed project estimated to cost nearly $100 million.</p>
        <p>But four years after the Army Corps of Engineers completed the construction phase of the vast beach and dune restoration on the western end of the island, requirements for public access to the ocean have been only partly implemented, or even flouted.</p>
        <p>Most notably, six public stairways in West Hampton Dunes that cross the reconstructed dune and lead to the beach are unmarked and in some cases hidden among the dozens of private ramps to new homes.</p>
        <p>Signs prominently posted near the six right-of-ways also prohibit parking except with permits available only to village residents. And there is no room for vehicles to pull over and discharge passengers near the stairways along two-lane Dune Road, which is heavily patrolled by village constables.</p>
        <p>The mayor of West Hampton Dunes, Gary Vegliante, said the 1.8-mile-long village was ''very much in favor of public access'' to the ocean and encouraged use of the public walkovers, which he said ''are being as used as much as they can be.''</p>
        <p>''You don't need a permit,'' he said. ''Just obey the law, don't drink, don't litter and don't bother the birds.'' The area is a habitat for the piping plover, an endangered species whose seasonal nesting areas are marked by string fences.</p>
        <p>But because the access stairways are unmarked and in areas with no public parking, they appear to be largely unnoticed and very lightly used. Many beach-goers who do use them appear to be owners, renters or visitors at nearby summer houses.</p>
        <p>Asked why the six access points were not marked, Mayor Vegliante said, ''We had signs up last year but they blew down or they fell down.'' He said the village was making new signs, and had repeatedly urged the Army Corps, which built the public walkovers, to assist in erecting signs.</p>
        <p>Clifford S. Jones, the Army Corps manager for the project, agreed that the access points were obscured. ''A lot of people are under the impression that everything out in the Hamptons is private,'' he said. ''We have some work to do in making the public access more visible.''</p>
        <p>New York State, which had insisted on public access, appears now to be less involved. Scott Trent, a spokesman for the New York Department of State, said the department's role applied to ''construction of the access ramps.''</p>
        <p>''The department ultimately fulfilled its obligation,'' he said. ''Beyond that, the issue of signage and parking was not something the department was party to.''</p>
        <p>The requirement for the six public access stairways was part of a 1994 Federal court settlement of a $200 million damage suit brought by property owners west of beach-protection groins built by the Army Corps in the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>The groins -- rocky fingers projecting seaward that were designed to trap sand and reverse severe erosion caused by a 1962 storm -- were to have extended the length of the island, but ended instead with a 15th groin at what is now the eastern boundary of West Hampton Dunes.</p>
        <p>The groins were blamed for erosion that destroyed more than 100 summer houses in the village and for eventually leading to a half-mile-wide breach in the island in 1992.</p>
        <p>The Army Corps closed the breach in an $8.8 million emergency project in 1993. Under the settlement, the corps also tapered the two westernmost groins, built a new groin between them and rebuilt the dune and beaches west of the 15th groin as part of a $17 million project completed in 1996. The project also involves beach maintenance over 30 years at a cost estimated at up to $70 million.</p>
        <p>The project literally recreated property in West Hampton Dunes that had been washed away. More than 200 summer homes, most built recently and more expensive than the homes they replaced, now line the ocean and bay side of village.</p>
        <p>The 1994 court agreement required, in turn, that there be ''conveniently located public access ways'' and affirmed ''the right of access to the restored beach by all members of the public.''</p>
        <p>It also required ''informative signage which, at a minimum, clearly indicates that public access ways are available for public use without charge.'' No such signs are posted.</p>
        <p>While the agreement did not require public parking at the access points, it called for ''pull-off areas'' of specific dimensions. But no such pull-off areas are provided.</p>
        <p>A provision that ''no residency restrictions will be imposed'' on parking at Cupsogue County Park, a Suffolk County beach just west of the village, appears to be in force. During the summer, the park charges $5 a day for holders of a county residency card, and $8 for others, meeting a requirement in the settlement that fees for nonresidents be ''on par with the charge for local residents.''</p>
        <p>Similar requirements were imposed for Pikes Beach, a Southampton Town-owned beach within the Village of West Hampton Dunes. The village was an unincorporated area before creation of the village in 1994.</p>
        <p>Allyn Jackson, the superintendent of parks, recreation and human services for Southampton, said the town was currently completing a 65-car paved lot at Pikes Beach. He said the lot would be ready for use by next season. Asked who would be permitted to use it, Mr. Jackson said that since the lot was not yet completed ''this is a non-issue right now.''</p>
        <p>''Our first priority is going to be to the residents, and perhaps to people who have bought a full-season beach permit,'' he said, referring to a town permit that costs $100. ''But the dailies, there might not be enough room for them quite yet.''</p>
        <p>Exclusion of nonresidents or charging them far higher fees for parking would appear to be contrary to the court settlement.</p>
        <p>Parts of the Westhampton barrier island are in the Quogue and Westhampton Beach. Both villages and other areas of the island owned by Southampton Town benefited from the original Army Corps groin project, which built up beaches within the groin field.</p>
        <p>Neither village offers public access to ocean beaches. Town parking lots are open to nonresidents for a $10 daily fee, but the sale of daily passes may be suspended when the lots near capacity on crowded days. There are also a few areas with unrestricted free parking near beach access points.</p>
