        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The cover article ''A Day in the Life of Newark Airport'' (July 2) neglects to report on the airport's onerous impact on New Jerseyans living under a cloud of noise pollution. Noise may be ameliorated in a number of ways. First, the Port Authority should support ocean routes, which would reduce or eliminate aircraft noise for over one million citizens. Additionally, two readily available funding sources for noise mitigation have been completely ignored by the Port Authority. These are the Federal Aviation Administration's Part 150 program and the $3 airport passenger facility charge, both of which finance an array of noise reduction strategies at airport facilities across the nation -- with the notable exception of Newark.</p>

        <p>The airport's continued growth and economic success must be shared as a neighborhood benefit through the development of credible noise abatement programs directed at improving the quality of daily life of New Jersey's residents.</p>
