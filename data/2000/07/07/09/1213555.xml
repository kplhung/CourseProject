        <p>LITTLE did I realize the price to be paid that fall when my neighbors told me the dying maple tree edging our property line would be cut down. All I could think of was the sunshine that would bathe the garden borders I had been trying to create. But then, the following spring, I realized that the gift of sunshine had led to the loss of privacy between our small lots.</p>
        <p>To recapture some feeling of our own space, my husband replaced the four-foot wire fence with a wooden lattice fence six feet tall, as high as allowed in our community. That helped, but not enough. So I turned to giant perennials, plants that would form a wall of greenery and soar above the fence with colorful flowers.  I reasoned that they would be a stopgap while I decided on an appropriate tree for the area.</p>

        <p>LITTLE did I realize the price to be paid that fall when my neighbors told me the dying maple tree edging our property line would be cut down. All I could think of was the sunshine that would bathe the garden borders I had been trying to create. But then, the following spring, I realized that the gift of sunshine had led to the loss of privacy between our small lots.</p>
        <p>To recapture some feeling of our own space, my husband replaced the four-foot wire fence with a wooden lattice fence six feet tall, as high as allowed in our community. That helped, but not enough. So I turned to giant perennials, plants that would form a wall of greenery and soar above the fence with colorful flowers.  I reasoned that they would be a stopgap while I decided on an appropriate tree for the area.</p>
        <p>To add a bit of flair, I chose little-known flowers. To guard against gaps in my privacy screen, I made sure the plants were all easy-care natives. This unusual, relatively inexpensive planting -- perennials cost much less than trees or shrubs -- has been so successful that I've never changed it. Indeed, I've added perennial screens in several other areas.</p>
        <p>Two Joe-Pye weed cultivars (in the Eupatorium genus) are essential components of these screens. Magnets for bees and butterflies, both feature flower clusters that form huge umbrellas crowning each seven- to eight-foot plant for at least four midsummer weeks. Gateway is doused with rosy purple, and Bartered Bride is covered with white. When their flowers are cut for arrangements (in the early morning to beat the insect rush), new blossoms take their place in about three weeks.</p>
        <p>The stalks can be cut back in late spring to hold the final size of the plants to five feet. I do this to get a layered look: stalks nearest to the front of the border are cut, and those in back reach their full height.</p>
        <p>These are supposed to be moisture-loving plants. Yet, to my great delight, they performed splendidly (although with a shorter bloom period) in last year's severe drought.</p>
        <p>Adding three more giant perennials, I can decorate my privacy screens with uninterrupted color through summer and often into fall. They are tough prairie plants, ones that can take both drought and deluge in their stride.</p>
        <p>The first to bloom, usually by late June, is the regal Queen-of-the-Prairie (Filipendula rubra Venusta).  This magnificent plant bears cotton candy plumes of pink flowers for two to three weeks and grows to six or seven feet tall.</p>
        <p>In its natural habitat, Queen-of-the-Prairie wanders through tall grasses and has to be a bit aggressive to compete. Where there is no competition, as in my border, it takes off. I've finally hemmed it in by surrounding it with orange day lilies.</p>
        <p>The lemon-yellow flowers on cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) start their four- to six-week bloom period in mid-July, decorated by myriad butterflies. Undecorated, they look like two-inch-wide daisies and are lovely in arrangements. When they finish flowering, they leave seed heads that are goldfinch favorites.</p>
        <p>The cup plant, which grows up to  eight feet, gets its name from the unusual configuration of its leaves.  These fold out from set intervals on stout stems, forming small cups.  Hummingbirds have been known to quench their thirst from these troughs after a light rain.</p>
        <p>The equally tall yellow coneflower (Rudbeckia Herbstsonne) is an example of an American native that has been refined by German plant breeders; the cultivar name means autumn sun in English. In my garden, however, the flowers usually open in late July, a week or so after the first cup plant flowers unfurl.  The coneflower's bloom period is much longer, often up to 10 weeks, and its flowers are a richer yellow.</p>
        <p>The two plants look lovely together or as attractions in their own right. Both have rich, dark green leaves that form a handsome backdrop for the shorter plants placed in front.</p>
        <p>All these perennials get a bit top-heavy when in flower and need some propping up. I slip dark green garden string through holes in the lattice and tie it around the plant stems once they have reached five feet.</p>
        <p>Aside from Queen-of-the-Prairie, all increase slowly over time, both through self-seeding and through root spread. This has allowed me to tinker with the color combinations over the years. The plants are all easy to move in spring when new growth starts to appear.</p>
        <p>Which all goes to show that you can have your sunshine and enjoy your privacy, too.</p>
