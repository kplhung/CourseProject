        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The scrawny, silver-haired man in the white pickup truck with turquoise trim never looked back after he unloaded his parcel beside a Dumpster at a Ewing Township aparment complex. It was 8:45 a.m. when a mutilated mother cat and her three terrified kittens were left to fend for themselves.</p>
        <p>A neighbor who witnessed this illegal and cruel act would later crawl under the Dumpster to retrieve the kittens.</p>
        <p>There are angels who can sometimes intervene in evil deeds like this one. But unfortunately there are too many unwanted, unneutered animals out there that need angels. For a few lucky ones there are caring owners and animal rescue groups. Angels in the form of Stray Katz rescued the mama cat and her kittens. All were treated by a vet and put up for adoption.</p>
        <p>Stray Katz is a nonprofit humane organization working to stem the growing population of homeless stray and feral cats through education and community action. This volunteer group has spayed, vaccinated and returned or placed for adoption thousands of such cats.</p>
        <p>It is through their kindness that once owned but suddenly unwanted pets like the mother cat and her kittens found care and another chance. This all comes at financial strain to Stray Katz rescuers, who often take expenses from their own pockets. It would be a blessing if those who care would send a small donation: Stray Katz, Post Office Box 5400, Trenton, N.J. 08638.</p>
