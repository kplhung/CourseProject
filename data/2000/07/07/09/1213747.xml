        <p>The stresses of modern life do not seem to concern one camp counselors' assistant who lives in upstate New York. While helping to teach children, she is more occupied with the cool country air and finds pastures particularly appealing -- the greener the better. And she knows how to manage a group of young campers: while chewing a tasty clump of grass, she keeps her four legs firmly on the ground and lets them milk her.</p>
        <p>The aide is a cow, named Figaro for her frequent and sonorous mooing. She is one of a number of animals used to help teach children from the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides summer vacations for needy children from the city. Children from the fund's five camps visit the farm, which is on one and a half acres of the Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, N.Y. It was donated to the fund in 1967 by local farmers. From May to September, seven full-time employees, as well as about 20 representatives of the animal kingdom who are also donated, work at the farm, which has a stable and a field for crops.</p>

        <p>The stresses of modern life do not seem to concern one camp counselors' assistant who lives in upstate New York. While helping to teach children, she is more occupied with the cool country air and finds pastures particularly appealing -- the greener the better. And she knows how to manage a group of young campers: while chewing a tasty clump of grass, she keeps her four legs firmly on the ground and lets them milk her.</p>
        <p>The aide is a cow, named Figaro for her frequent and sonorous mooing. She is one of a number of animals used to help teach children from the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides summer vacations for needy children from the city. Children from the fund's five camps visit the farm, which is on one and a half acres of the Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, N.Y. It was donated to the fund in 1967 by local farmers. From May to September, seven full-time employees, as well as about 20 representatives of the animal kingdom who are also donated, work at the farm, which has a stable and a field for crops.</p>
        <p>Recently, 30 boys ages 9 to 12 who were at the fund's Camp Hayden-Marks Memorial, a two-week outdoor program, took a break from sports and arts and crafts to learn from Figaro and her comrades.</p>
        <p>''It's a very unique experience,'' said Jenny Morgenthau, the executive director of the fund. ''Kids are learning something new in a non-school setting, and they're so excited about getting these experiences.''</p>
        <p>But at least one boy seemed hesitant when given his chance to milk Figaro. The farm's assistant director, Emily Danforth, asked for volunteers to milk the cow, who was standing calmly in her pen. Most of the boys' hands eagerly shot up. But Tyrone White, 10, from the Bronx, was not quite ready.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to touch it,'' he said after surveying the cow's udders. ''It's gross.'' But after seeing the other boys' excitement, Tyrone was hunched beside the cow only a few moments later.</p>
        <p>The children moved on to visit the farm's half dozen or so turkeys, and then it was time to get a look at and taste its crops, which included sage, pumpkins, tomatoes and peas.</p>
        <p>They taste-tested some rhubarb plants. The leaves are poisonous, Ms. Danforth told them, but the stalks are edible. Ibu Payton, 11, of Brooklyn, was skeptical.</p>
        <p>''I'm not eating this, because it's poison,'' he said. But he became emboldened after Ms. Danforth tried the plant and the other children followed suit. After seeing the others chomp for a few minutes, Ibu had a rhubarb stem sticking out of his mouth.</p>
        <p>Tim Stanley, who is in his fifth year as director of the farm, said the farm not only educated children about animals and plants, but it helped them gain a better understanding of another way of life and encouraged them to try new experiences.</p>
        <p>Many of the children who visit -- most from poor, urban backgrounds -- are not familiar with rural environments and do not think about the fact that most of their food comes from farms.</p>
        <p>''We help get a new point of view,'' said Mr. Stanley. ''I guess that's what life's all about: learning and discovering new things.''</p>
        <p>On the walk back to camp after the farm visit, Israel Valetin, 9, from Queens, discussed his favorite animals, the farm's pigs. Israel, who had previously touched animals only at the zoo, was excited that he got to hug a pig, although it had run away a couple of times. He said he learned that pigs, which have a reputation for being dirty because they roll in mud to stay cool, are actually very clean.</p>
        <p>''People think pigs are messy, but that's not fair,'' he said. ''They don't even know them.''</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation may call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency may send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
