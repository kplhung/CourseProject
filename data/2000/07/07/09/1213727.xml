        <p>As expected, Vice President Al Gore received overwhelming endorsements from the two national teachers unions and enormous ovations when he visited their conventions. Mr. Gore spoke first to the American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia, then flew to Chicago to address the National Education Association.</p>
        <p>The teachers are part of a large labor coalition backing Mr. Gore candidacy, and have been energized by his staunch opposition to vouchers, which would allow public money to be used for private-school tuition. His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, supports them.</p>
