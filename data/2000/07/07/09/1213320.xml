        <p>TECHNOLOGY has eliminated certain problems of calling home from Europe: Belle Epoque hotel instruments, non-English-speaking operators and wavering connections. The new problems arise from the technology and its overflow of possibilities: you can buy a cell phone compatible with European services, or rent one; sign up for an international program with your regular phone company, or sign up for another overseas service.</p>
        <p>For those preparing for a trip, here is a review of a very few of the newer possibilities. It's impossible to be comprehensive in a field that is changing so fast: on June 27, the Justice Department moved to block  Worldcom, which absorbed MCI in 1998, from acquiring Sprint. Before picking any of the options below, be sure to ask how -- and if -- the service works in your destinations.</p>

        <p>TECHNOLOGY has eliminated certain problems of calling home from Europe: Belle Epoque hotel instruments, non-English-speaking operators and wavering connections. The new problems arise from the technology and its overflow of possibilities: you can buy a cell phone compatible with European services, or rent one; sign up for an international program with your regular phone company, or sign up for another overseas service.</p>
        <p>For those preparing for a trip, here is a review of a very few of the newer possibilities. It's impossible to be comprehensive in a field that is changing so fast: on June 27, the Justice Department moved to block  Worldcom, which absorbed MCI in 1998, from acquiring Sprint. Before picking any of the options below, be sure to ask how -- and if -- the service works in your destinations.</p>
        <p>Experts describe the international cell-phone picture as a Tower of Babel. Almost all wireless companies in Europe and the Middle East use the same digital technology, G.S.M., or global system for mobile communication. But the United States apparently got left behind on this. Most companies here use quite a number of other technologies and frequencies, so most cell phones in the United States will not work overseas.</p>
        <p>This gave rise to the idea of renting cell phones to passengers going overseas. International Mobile Communications, in Bethesda, Md., offers its WorldCell for rent. Patrice  Brown, a marketing executive, said  the company ships rental Nokia and Motorola phones, which work in 100 countries, to clients by overnight courier. It costs $75 for the first week, $50 for extra weeks.</p>
        <p>Calls on these phones may be charged to calling cards, or a plan may be established with WorldCell. Ms. Brown said that a typical call to the United States from France would cost $2.69 a minute, from Britain, $2.91, and from Italy, $2.34. If the renter elects prepaid air time, flat rates of $3.99 or $4.99 a minute would apply worldwide. International Mobile Communications: (888) 967-5323, www.worldcell.com.</p>
        <p>Bilingual Phone</p>
        <p>Nextel Communications has brought out a dual-mode Motorola phone that operates in a number of United States metropolitan areas  and 70 countries overseas. It incorporates G.S.M. with iDEN, the company's frequency for the Western Hemisphere. Daisann McLane, who writes the Frugal Traveler for The Times, took a Nextel to Spain in the spring. When she called from Madrid, her editor said it sounded as if she were next door. Ms. McLane said that the outgoing calls worked much better than incoming ones from overseas; she said most calls to her were routed to her e-mail or to a recording saying her line was busy.</p>
        <p>''The big advantage was the ability to make local calls,'' she said. ''Once, I got lost looking for my house rental in the Canary Islands. I used it to call the rental agent, who guided me to my destination.''</p>
        <p>Away from major metropolitan areas in rural Spain, the connection sometimes faltered, Ms. McLane  said. She said a cell phone in her backpack reduced her worry about hiking alone. Asian coverage is a mixed bag.</p>
        <p>The Nextel Motorola i2000 costs $199. Per-minute rates range from 99 cents in France to $5.99 in Russia. Nextel: (800) 639-8359; www.nextel .com/worldwide.</p>
        <p>VoiceStream Wireless, formerly Omnipoint, sells two dual-band cell phones, the Ericsson I-888 and the Motorola L-7089, for $299.95 each. The monthly service plan is $19.99; calls are additional. To take the phone overseas, the owner must have a credit record acceptable to VoiceStream; otherwise there is a delay of six months after purchase.  VoiceStream also has a rental plan for various models for $29 a week, which includes overnight delivery and prepaid return of the phone. Peter Sandusky, head of international marketing, said the rental rate was  lower than the competition because VoiceStream's business is selling phone calls. A freeze of $300 is put on the client's credit card against return of the phone and $300 more for the data card, or SIM, that is put into it. Per-minute rates from Britain start at $2.20; from Italy, $1.40; and from France, $1.60. VoiceStream: (877) 666-4246; www.omnipoint.com.</p>
        <p>Other Choices</p>
        <p>In many G.S.M. countries, inexpensive cell phones are available with prepaid cards, a way to use a cell phone for a few weeks without monthly charges. Small European towns often have cell-phone sales offices. The www.gsm.org site lists all G.S.M. countries, service providers in each and some of their Web sites.</p>
        <p>The older possibilities are international calling plans offered by domestic phone companies.</p>
        <p>Sprint created a program this spring that is not linked to its regular domestic billing or to calling cards: It uses credit cards. A call made through the program, called You, costs $3 for the connection, plus $1.25 a minute. The plan is available in 50 countries, islands and cities worldwide, with the focus on the Caribbean. In each country there is an access code that leads to an English-speaking operator. Travelers overseas may learn the access code through a collect call to (913) 624-5336; wallet guides are also available at some airports and Sprint centers in the United States. Sprint: (800) 877-4646. The Web site, www.youcallhome.com, is incomplete but contains the access codes.</p>
        <p>MCI WorldCom this spring began a sign-up plan with a $3 monthly charge, local access numbers and per-minute charges based on the country where the call is made or going to. Weekend rates are lower, with the weekend starting at midnight Friday in the place being called. A call from France is 17 cents a minute during the week; 9 cents weekends; from Britain, rates are 10 cents and 9 cents, and from Italy, 17 cents and 9 cents. Access codes are on the Web site. MCI International Weekends: (800) 759-1697, www.mci .com/international.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T Direct also uses local access numbers for an operator or dial tone in the United States. The call is billed to an AT&amp;T calling card or Universal Card, some local phone cards or is placed collect. A directory of access numbers is available at the Web site. Various rate plans  bring prices down toward costs of domestic calls. Without these plans, all AT&amp;T Direct calls have an initial fee of $4.50 on the first minute, bringing a one-minute call home from Britain to $7.32; from France, $7.15; from Italy, $7.40. AT&amp;T Direct: (800) 331-1140, www.att.com/traveler.</p>
        <p>Under call-back systems, the overseas caller dials a special number, lets it ring once and hangs up. The caller then gets a call back, which offers either a dial tone or a computerized voice prompt or United States operator asking for the customer by name: the call is then placed as a domestic call.</p>
        <p>To set this up, the traveler must first call to establish the overseas number being used. This was ideal for a colleague's daughter staying in an apartment in Florence; not so good for someone changing cities daily. Kallback in Seattle says it is the oldest company in this line of  business. One plan costs $10 a month, plus $2 a month for each overseas number in the system; rates are less than a dollar a minute for most European countries. Kallback: (800) 959-5255, fax (800) 949-5255.</p>
