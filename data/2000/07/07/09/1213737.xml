        <p>Disco is dead, again. But its musical offspring, house, is kept alive in the dance halls of cyberspace by a ragtag crew of devoted listeners.</p>
        <p>UndergroundNYC.com offers listeners a vast compilation of house, soul-stomping dance tracks popular during the mid-80's to the mid-90's.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is caught up in the latest, cutting edge stuff,'' said Nestor Delgado, a 34-year-old Con Edison worker by day who surfaces at night to maintain his site. ''There's no representation of the old school anymore.''</p>
        <p>He created the site two years ago to fill the void.</p>
        <p>Many of the archived sets had their premiere on the dance floors of nightclubs in west Chelsea, like the Tunnel and the now-defunct Sound Factory and 1018. House music may have started in Chicago, Mr. Delgado said, but New York is credited with forging its own version and spreading it underground.</p>
        <p>House music fell off the city's turntables in 1995, he added, and was replaced by techno and hip-hop. ''All the famous D.J.'s concentrated on spinning overseas,'' he said. But some house disc jockeys appear to be returning, spurred on by a combination of nostalgia and technology.</p>
        <p>''It's making its way back on some radio stations,'' Mr. Delgado said, referring to weekend programs on WTKU (103.5 FM) and WRKS (98.7 FM). ''Through the site, people are calling up and asking them to play more house.''</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- The site gives top billing to Recent Updates, provided by popular D.J. like Frankie Knuckles, David Morales and Tony Humphries. Each entry includes a brief prelude followed by a play list whose songs can be heard immediately or downloaded for a future spin.</p>
        <p>A menu bar lists the other musical offerings on the site. One library, Classic Radio Mixes, includes what the site describes as a ''very limited collection'' of rare tapes from the mid-80's to the early 90's. It even includes a smattering of ''underground disco'' from the late 70's.</p>
        <p>The Message Board has a lively discussion about the music scene, and NYC Clubs &amp; Parties lists club dates at which house is staging a comeback.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- YellOrange.com is the site for a record label in East Orange, N.J., and UndergroundHouse.com is a site in Chicago that offers its own distinctive flavor of house.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A club pass to hear a slice of the city's underground music scene, circa 1990.</p>
