        <p>THE world is still waiting for Judy Davis to give a bad performance. Even in an irreverently funny but off-kilter movie like Peter Duncan's CHILDREN OF THE REVOLUTION (1996), she's joy to behold. Her character is an eager young pro-Communist Australian with the chance of a lifetime: a trip to the Soviet Union to meet Stalin. Things get cozy, and soon she's back in Australia rearing a son who doesn't know who is real father is. Geoffrey Rush, Sam Neill and F. Murray Abraham play the men in her life. Rachel Griffiths is terrific as her policewoman daughter-in-law. The film answers that burning question ''What do you wear on a dinner date with Stalin?'' All red, of course - Monday at midnight and Monday/Early Tuesday at 4:15 a.m. on IFC.</p>

        <p>THE world is still waiting for Judy Davis to give a bad performance.

Her character is an eager young pro-Communist Australian with the chance of a lifetime: a trip to the Soviet Union to meet Stalin.

All red, of course - Monday at midnight and Monday/Early Tuesday at 4:15 a.m. on IFC.</p>
        <p>Anyone who remembers (or imagines) the 1950's as all sweetness and light and Eisenhower hominess needs to see Alexander Mackendrick's powerfully cynical SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS (1957) again. Burt Lancaster outdoes himself as J. J. Hunsecker, the despicable, power-intoxicated newspaper columnist. Tony Curtis is impressively slimy as Sidney Falco, the publicist who gladly lowers himself time and again to get items into Hunsecker's column. Susan Harrison plays the columnist's sweet younger sister who makes the mistake of falling in love. Times Square looks bleak, threatening and partly residential; isn't Hunsecker's apartment in the Brill Building? - Saturday at 5 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>A trip to the seamier side of the 50's should also include Otto Preminger's MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM (1955). Frank Sinatra plays a former heroin addict suffering a relapse. Only the love of a good woman (improbably played by Kim Novak) can save him. Even in an era in which critics had to explain the meaning of ''fix'' to readers, Sinatra's cure-withdrawal looked suspiciously simple. But elsewhere this is scalding stuff, proving that (just as in movie sex) skillful indirectness can have more impact than the explicit - Saturday at 5 p.m. on Channel 55.</p>
        <p>What is there to say about Greer Garson in Mrs. Miniver (1942)? She, the film, the director (William Wyler) and her young co-star Teresa Wright all won Oscars for this memorably touching drama about England's upper-middle-class home front in World War II. The story begins with a silly small-town tiff about a flower competition and ends in the town's bombed-out church shortly after a truly unexpected casualty. The rest of the cast is outstanding too: Walter Pidgeon as Garson's husband, Richard Ney as her son home from Oxford and Dame May Whitty as the local grande dame with a breakable heart - Saturday at 9 p.m. on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>Brad Pitt was first noticed by movie audiences in 1991 as a persuasive small-time thief in ''Thelma and Louise,'' but it took three more years for him to become a movie star. That happened when he made his first entrance on horseback with his long, blond hair flowing in Edward Zwick's LEGENDS OF THE FALL (1994). The film purports to be a family saga about a forward-thinking former cavalry offer (Anthony Hopkins) living in Montana, his three sons (Aidan Quinn, Henry Thomas and Mr. Pitt) and the woman they all love (Julia Ormond). It's really about the injustice of a world in which the boy always win. It's also totally superficial but gorgeous to look at; John Toll won the Oscar for cinematography - Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 4.</p>
