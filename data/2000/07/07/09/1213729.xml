        <p>A revolutionary court in the southern city of Shiraz convicted 10 of 13 Iranian Jews of spying for Israel. They received sentences ranging from 4 to 13 years in prison. The other three were acquitted.</p>
        <p>The verdict and the closed trial were greeted with protests by Jewish and human rights groups, who saw the proceedings as possibly more political than criminal in nature.</p>
        <p>Ismail Nasseri Mojarrad, part of the defense team, expressed hope that the sentences would be reduced by the appeals court. ''The court lacks evidence except confessions by some of the Jews which we insist are not valid  according to the law,'' Mr. Mojarrad said.</p>
