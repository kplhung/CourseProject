      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Conseco Inc., the troubled insurance and finance company, said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 2,000 jobs from its Conseco Finance operation and sell numerous assets as it sought to raise cash to meet debt payments coming due.</p>
        <p>Gary C. Wendt, the company's new chairman and chief executive, said Conseco's strategy would concentrate on raising cash to meet debts at the holding company and on producing long-term earnings, without regard to whether accounting rules will allow it to show profit.</p>
        <p>Conseco had a long string of rising profits under its founder and former chief executive, Steven Hilbert. But the holding company that controlled the insurance subsidiaries was left with a rising level of debt, and investors began to doubt the quality of the earnings reported.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the company reported a loss of $404.7 million, or $1.25 a share, for the second quarter, in contrast to profit of $213.3 million, or 64 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The loss included many special items, such as writing down assets that are being sold and the $45 million signing bonus given to Mr. Wendt.</p>
        <p>Conseco said its operating loss was $28.6 million, or 9 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Conseco Finance, the former Green Tree Financial, had been put up for sale by previous management, but the offers were not high enough and Mr. Wendt indicated that he was now more interested in operating it than in selling it. He compared losing the finance company, a leader in providing money for mobile homes, to a person's losing one of his two arms.</p>
        <p>Asked during a conference call with analysts if the finance unit was still for sale, he replied, ''Everything is for sale,'' but then added: ''My top priority is to sell the holding company. If you know anyone who would like to buy that puppy, we can make a really good deal for them.''</p>
        <p>He said the finance unit would be operated so that it could become self-financing and a contributor of cash to the parent company, rather than a drain on cash. He said that the company now had $300 million to prepay debts coming due in September and that when sales of assets were completed, it would have the cash needed to pay debt due this year and ''well into 2001.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt, who gained a Wall Street following as chief executive of GE Capital, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, also announced that three people who had worked with him at GE Capital -- Paul Street, Mike Borom and Peter Keenoy -- ''have joined our team of restoration activists.''</p>
        <p>Conseco shares, which reached a peak of $58.125 early in 1998, just before Green Tree was acquired, rose $1.625 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, to $9.50, before the company made its announcements.</p>
        <p>Conseco said it would sell its stake in Tritel, a wireless telephone company, whose shares fell $1.8125, to $29.8125. It took a $47.6 million charge to write that stake down to market value.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wendt said the company would also focus on restoring the ratings of its insurance companies. A. M. Best has downgraded Conseco to a rating of B++, which is devastating in an industry in which nearly every company has a rating of A or higher. Mr. Wendt said that getting holding company debt down would be a primary part of his strategy.</p>
        <p>Until that happens, he said, the company would look for ''rented equity,'' a situation in which other insurance companies provide reinsurance so that Conseco products can be rated highly enough for it to be able to sell new policies.</p>
        <p>At the finance unit, which Mr. Wendt said had ''been portrayed as the demon in the Conseco house,'' the company plans to sell five business units and to reduce costs by closing some offices.</p>
        <p>He said that would lead to a loss of 2,000 jobs. When the restructuring is completed, he said, Conseco Finance would be able to grow while spinning off cash to its parent.</p>
