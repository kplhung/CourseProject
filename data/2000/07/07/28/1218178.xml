        <p>Over the last two decades or so, sex in movies -- even French movies -- has become demystified, conventional and, well, unsexy. Even the most artfully directed writhing, the most ardently counterfeited sighs and moans can seem a bit pro forma. And so ambitious filmmakers -- especially French ones -- are faced with the challenge of how to bring genuine erotic heat to the screen.</p>
        <p>In ''Girl on the Bridge,'' a soap bubble of romantic attitude and secondhand glamour, Patrice Leconte succeeds by discovering something sexier than sex, at once a perfect metaphor and a convincing substitute for it. That something is knife throwing, an obscure music-hall attraction that Mr. Leconte dusts off and places at the center of this giddy sendup of (and tribute to) European cinema in its heady postwar golden age.</p>
        <p>Shot in sumptuous black and white, replete with dizzy, swooping camera effects and gorgeous shots of Paris, Monaco, Athens and Istanbul, ''Girl on the Bridge'' is like a pocket anthology of your favorite foreign movies (or mine, anyway), a meticulous cut-and-paste collage of a half-dozen half-remembered, dreamed-up movies by Godard, Truffaut and, above all, Fellini. The story is ''La Strada'' without the poverty and fatalism: it follows the sadomasochistic, symbiotic relationship between a knocked-around carnival performer and his assistant. The homage to Fellini is far from subtle: there is the parade of clowns, dwarves and contortionists, big luxury cruise ships and garish casinos, pore-tight close-ups and careening crane shots.</p>
        <p>But back to the knife throwing. Adele (Vanessa Paradis) is a young woman who has drifted through a life of aimless, passive promiscuity (''I believe every promise I hear'') that has led her to the brink of suicide. Standing on a chilly Paris bridge, she meets Gabor (Daniel Auteuil), a profane, philosophical knife thrower out recruiting new talent. After saving her life, he persuades her to risk it, and they set out to conquer the cabarets and casinos of Europe with their act. He seems a bit uncertain of his own skill, but that, he assures her, is a secondary consideration. The secret to knife throwing is to find a fortunate target.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Gabor briefs Adele on the finer points of his worldview, a kind of gambler's mysticism based on the cosmology of luck. He also instructs her in the cultivation of her gifts. ''The audience must fall in love with you,'' he instructs. It isn't difficult. The coltish, gap-toothed Ms. Paradis, heretofore best known in France as a pop singer, has the effortless gamine appeal of Jean Seberg in ''Breathless'' or Audrey Hepburn in ''Funny Face.'' Gabor, needless to say, falls hard, but the only consummation he needs is to stand and hurl the tools of his trade, with their long, symmetrical, rounded blades, at her trembling form.</p>
        <p>The first time they do this for an audience, she's hidden behind a sheet, and it's one of the most sexually charged sequences ever filmed, full of danger and audacity. But as the film pursues the metaphoric link between cutlery and concupiscence, with its overtones of risk and domination, it loses some of its insouciant accuracy. By the time Gabor and Adele perform in private, in an empty warehouse, for the sole purpose of satisfying their own desires, the scene has a cheap, heavy-breathing staginess. They might as well be doing it the old-fashioned way, between the sheets, without any sharp objects on hand.</p>
        <p>''Girl on the Bridge'' is most entertaining when it takes itself least seriously, when it forsakes melancholy romanticism for the gaudy, extravagant kind. The chemistry between Mr. Auteuil, with his craggy, unshaven sensuality, and Ms. Paradis, with her sexual incandescence, is so perfect that it undermines the movie's attempt to generate conflict and distance between them.</p>
        <p>Adele is supposedly still drawn to her old, man-crazy life, but her intoxication with Gabor and his blades is so evident that we don't understand why she would want anything else. The targets of her lust seem so pretty and callow that they can't be serious rivals, and the film's last third, during which the couple's luck turns bad, is so predictable and lacking in dramatic force that not even the glories of the Acropolis at dusk or the shimmering lights of the Bosphorus can save the movie. The final scene is such a heavy dose of Hollywood schmaltz that you half expect Mr. Auteuil and Ms. Paradis to be replaced by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.</p>
        <p>Watching this film, with its brightly underscored themes of luck and risk, is like watching a high-stakes gambler amass a big pile of chips and then fritter it away on a series of small, pointless bets. Mr. Leconte's visual instincts are so impressive that they outstrip his story, leaving us flushed and dazzled, but also, as after a long night of champagne and baccarat (to say nothing of other irresponsible pleasures), hungry, tired, and homesick.</p>
        <p>''Girl on the Bridge'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and obvious sexual metaphors.</p>
