        <p>WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance company, reported a 53 percent rise in second-quarter earnings before charges yesterday, matching Wall Street expectations. But the company also warned that sales growth for the rest of the year would be at the low end of its previous estimate, and WorldCom shares tumbled as much as 15 percent before recovering somewhat.</p>
        <p>The caution from the company, as well as a warning earlier in the day from Nokia of Finland, the mobile phone colossus, dragged down shares of telecommunications and technology companies as investors grew concerned about a slowdown. The Nasdaq market -- where WorldCom shares trade -- ended down 3.65 percent, its biggest daily decline in two months.</p>

        <p>WorldCom Inc., the nation's second-largest long-distance company, reported a 53 percent rise in second-quarter earnings before charges yesterday, matching Wall Street expectations. But the company also warned that sales growth for the rest of the year would be at the low end of its previous estimate, and WorldCom shares tumbled as much as 15 percent before recovering somewhat.</p>
        <p>The caution from the company, as well as a warning earlier in the day from Nokia of Finland, the mobile phone colossus, dragged down shares of telecommunications and technology companies as investors grew concerned about a slowdown. The Nasdaq market -- where WorldCom shares trade -- ended down 3.65 percent, its biggest daily decline in two months.</p>
        <p>''It's a very rough day for telecom and tech stocks,'' said Bruce Roberts, senior telecommunications services analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
        <p>WorldCom said that lower-than-expected revenue from a contract with America Online and fierce competition in the voice long-distance business put a damper on second-quarter income.</p>
        <p>Excluding charges of $55 million related to the termination of its proposed $115 billion acquisition of the Sprint Corporation, WorldCom earned $1.35 billion, or 46 cents a share.</p>
        <p>WorldCom also said yesterday that the company was considering splitting its voice and other operations into separate companies or tracking stocks.</p>
        <p>WorldCom, like other telecommunications companies, has been expanding rapidly in the market for Internet and data services. For the quarter, Internet, data and international revenue grew 30 percent from the quarter a year ago, and now account for nearly half of WorldCom's total revenue.</p>
        <p>But like the No. 1 long-distance provider, AT&amp;T, WorldCom faces continued pricing pressures in the long-distance market, where most customers still pay by the minute.</p>
        <p>In a conference call today, WorldCom executives said sales growth in the second half of the year would be at the low end of its previously estimated range of 13.5 to 15.5 percent. While WorldCom's growth rate still remains above that of its chief competitors, the lowered forecast was enough to unnerve investors.</p>
        <p>Shares of WorldCom fell $5.4375, or 12 percent, to $39.3125, as nearly 63 million shares traded hands on the Nasdaq market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts of Dresdner Kleinwort said yesterday's selloff was an overreaction. ''The spinoffs are more or less a neutral for the company, and the lower top-line guidance from the company isn't as harsh as the sell-off in the stock suggests,'' he said. ''The company still looks very attractive in terms of Internet backbone, networks, revenue from overseas, and other areas.''</p>
