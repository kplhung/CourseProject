        <p>The battle lines for ''Avow,'' Bill C. Davis's new broadside against the Roman Catholic Church, are drawn in the spare set that greets the audience as it enters the theater.

        <p>The battle lines for ''Avow,'' Bill C. Davis's new broadside against the Roman Catholic Church, are drawn in the spare set that greets the audience as it enters the theater. In center stage stands a large bed, a symbol for the war about to be waged between religious conviction and sex. Guess who wins.</p>
        <p>It has been nearly 20 years since Mr. Davis gained fame with ''Mass Appeal,'' a comedy about a complacent middle-aged Catholic priest and a young seminarian jousting over theology. In the mid-1980's, a couple of his other plays -- ''Dancing in the End Zone'' and ''Wrestling'' -- were less successful on Broadway. With his new play Mr. Davis returns to the milieu of his first hit, this time ridiculing the attitudes of the Catholic Church toward gays, unwed mothers and priestly celibacy. If ''Avow'' at times seems to be preaching to the converted, it is still a diverting sermon.</p>
        <p>The play concerns two relationships -- one homosexual and the other heterosexual -- in which one couple wants to exchange vows while the other considers breaking them. At the outset, two young gay men visit Father Raymond (Alan Campbell), a young priest they admire for his sermons (he's against boxing and admires Thomas Merton), and ask him to marry them.</p>
        <p>Brian (Christopher Sieber) and Tom (Scott Ferrara) are ''salad bar Catholics'' (''We take what we feel will nourish us and leave the rest alone'') who met cute -- Brian trains seeing-eye dogs and Tom is a veterinarian -- and are at the point where one finishes the sentences of the other. When Father Raymond declines their request, suggesting that ''faith has got to be deeper than your desires,'' Brian hurls derisive invective at him, but Tom begins to ponder the priest's admonition.</p>
        <p>Enter Brian's sister, Irene (Sarah Knowlton), a pianist who is pregnant from an affair with a married man and who plans to let Brian and Tom  adopt the baby when it is born. She visits Father Raymond to plead the case for her brother and his lover (''Why can't you just give them what they want?'') and falls head over heels for him. After reprimanding her (''The love of the church is not 'giving people what they want' ''), Father Raymond also begins to feel some decidedly unchaste stirrings for Irene.</p>
        <p>If these plot contrivances require a small leap of credulity on the part of the audience, they at least set up a neat row of theological targets for Mr. Davis to take aim at. The question of same-sex unions is particularly timely, and not just for the Catholic church. Most Protestant denominations are grappling with the issue, as are most state governments. Single mothers and gay parenting are also talk-show topics, and while priestly celibacy may be a singularly Catholic concern, marital infidelity is a subject that never seems to be out of fashion.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Davis actually confronts these issues head on, he too often takes the easy way out -- with a laugh. When his characters talk of their struggles of conscience, it is only in vague general terms in which they end up representing ideas in a debate rather than emerging as real people. No one, for example, ever explains exactly what the Church of Rome thinks about homosexuality or why. So while ''Avow'' often succeeds on the comedic level (and it has its fair share of humor), it is frequently only skin-deep on the human level. In the end, Mr. Davis covers little new ground and offers no insights.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of ''love'' in the play, the real point of reference is lust. When Tom begins to contemplate a celibate life, for example, Brian goes into a rage, speaking of his higher, till-death-do-us-part ''love'' but refusing even to consider a relationship with Tom that does not include the physical.</p>
        <p>Throughout the play, that bed in David Jenkins's spare set remains the battleground, and under Jack Hofsiss's smart direction all the action takes place around it, whether the scene is set in a rectory, a confessional, Brian's apartment or Tom's veterinary office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofsiss maintains a pace that keeps the narrative moving -- each new scene rushing in on the heels of the preceding one -- and gives little time for contemplation. It is the funny moments that stay with the audience, and some of the funniest are provided by Jane Powell, who almost steals the show as Rose, Brian's and Irene's mother.</p>
        <p>Ms. Powell shows why she is a star in her first scene. Irene has arranged a reconciliation lunch between Brian and their mother. Ms. Powell looks wryly at her children and with a line many actresses would simply toss off or even cut as superfluous -- ''So here I am with my gay son and my unmarried, pregnant daughter'' -- gets one of the biggest laughs of the night.</p>
        <p>As Father Raymond, Mr. Campbell is convincing as a priest torn between sexual desire and vocation, although the audience may find it difficult to accept his sudden infatuation with the first young woman who throws herself at him. Mr. Ferrara and Mr. Sieber make a handsome couple, although Mr. Sieber's militancy becomes a bit shrill from time to time. Ms. Knowlton also moves back and forth between charm and rage as Irene. And Kathleen Doyle contributes a nice turn as Julie, the rectory maid who has her own opinions about priests and celibacy.</p>
