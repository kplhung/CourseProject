        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''New York Still Needs Patches of Green,'' by Thomas Balsley (Op-Ed, July 22):</p>
        <p>As a cultural anthropologist who has spent 25 years studying the psychological, social and cultural importance of parks and plazas, I would like to offer even more evidence that we should be redesigning, not eliminating, urban public space.</p>
        <p>From a 15-year study of Latin American plazas, I discovered that well-planned public space increases social tolerance through informal cross-class and cross-gender contact. Urban public spaces, in New York as well as in Mexico and Costa Rica, provide an important forum for ideas and values to be expressed and worked out.</p>
        <p>In addition, many neighborhood parks serve as backyards for people of modest means. Reducing the opportunities for relaxation and solace makes very little sense when their needs are so great.</p>
        <p>SETHA M. LOW  East Hampton, N.Y., June 25, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of environmental psychology and anthropology at the CUNY Graduate Center.</p>
