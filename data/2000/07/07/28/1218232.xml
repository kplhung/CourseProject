        <p>The battleground in the fast-moving Democratic governor's race shifted to organized labor today, as dozens of union leaders representing a majority of the New Jersey labor movement endorsed Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge over Senator Robert G. Torricelli.</p>
        <p>For Mr. McGreevey, who is in the fight of his political life, the day was doubly sweet, as a new survey suggested that Mr. Torricelli's image among voters could use burnishing.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey has tirelessly cultivated labor leaders across the state since entering the 1997 governor's race, and at a State House news conference today he reaped a strong showing of support, which he called the largest labor endorsement ever in a New Jersey primary.</p>
        <p>The more than 150 union members  included officials representing the bulk of the state's building and construction workers, and sizable locals of communications workers, civil servants, firefighters, teamsters and electricians. They packed an airless conference room, vowing their loyalty to Mr. McGreevey and criticizing Mr. Torricelli, saying he had divided the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli had supported Mr. McGreevey's candidacy until a few weeks ago, when the senator suddenly entered the race, and Mr. McGreevey alluded to that reversal today.</p>
        <p>''What is at stake in this governor's race is nothing less than electing a governor that one can trust, and that one relies upon his word,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several labor officials picked up on the theme. ''I don't know about some of you out there, but I feel kind of betrayed in some ways,'' said Harvey Whille, president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1262 in Clifton, which has 32,000 members. He said he first supported Mr. McGreevey several years ago at the urging of Mr. Torricelli and other party leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, meanwhile, countered with five endorsements from union officials, including the heads of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America, the letter carriers' union in the state, and Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, as well as John Critchley, president of the state's Building and Construction Trades Council. (Curiously, Joseph Demark, executive director of the council, and Mr. Critchley's son, David, of the roofers' union, endorsed Mr. McGreevey.)</p>
        <p>Advisers to the senator also noted that several unions that have powerful political arms and that have supported Mr. Torricelli in the past -- those representing laborers, carpenters, and automobile workers among them -- had yet to weigh in.</p>
        <p>As the infighting continued, a new poll by Quinnipiac University suggested that Mr. Torricelli's image among voters was less than stellar, while Mr. McGreevey remained unknown by more than half of both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Only 42 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Torricelli's job performance, according to the survey of 910 registered voters taken July 19 to 24. Those who viewed the senator favorably outnumbered those with an unfavorable opinion by only 5 percentage points, 27 percent versus 22 percent. Mr. McGreevey, by comparison, was perceived favorably by 19 percent and unfavorably by 9 percent, the poll found.</p>
        <p>Among Democrats, Mr. Torricelli's favorable ratings outweighed his unfavorable ratings, 40 percent to 10 percent, and Mr. McGreevey's ratings were 26 percent favorable and 3 percent unfavorable. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
