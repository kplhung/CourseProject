        <p>BRITAIN: HEALTH SERVICE REFORM  Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed the biggest reform of the beleaguered National Health Service in its 52 years, with promises of more doctors and nurses, improved patient care, reduced waiting times and spending increases of 6.1 percent above inflation over the next four years to bring the service in line with European averages. The erosion in health services has hurt Mr. Blair's popularity.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: EXPLOSION IN DUSSELDORF  An explosion in a pedestrian tunnel leading into a commuter railway station injured nine people, two of them seriously, and the police said a bomb was suspected. No claims of responsibility were made. Bomb attacks have been rare in Germany in recent years. A grenade attack on a Hamburg disco this year has been linked to the city's drug trade.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: ASYLUM REJECTED  A 21-year-old Afghan man who arrived in Britain as a hostage on a hijacked airliner in February was rebuffed in his  request for political asylum. The unidentified man was the first of a group of 31 asylum-seekers who say they will be executed by the Taliban authorities if they return home. They were among 170 people on board an Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 hijacked to Stansted Airport near London last February. The incident ended without violence.</p>

        <p>ITALY: NO THREEPENNY OPERA  Luciano Pavarotti  has agreed to pay more than $12 million in back taxes, ending one of the more operatic tax disputes in Italian fiscal history. The government maintained that the tenor had falsely listed a house in the tax haven of Monte Carlo as his primary residence. In a letter to the Turin newspaper, La Stampa, Mr. Pavarotti wrote that ''it is very difficult to explain the life of one who travels the world and who visits 50 cities every year.''</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: POWER FAILURES  The mayor of the port town of Nakhodka in Russia's Far East, Viktor Gnezdilov, has appealed to Moscow for help in preventing chronic electricity blackouts, Interfax reported. Earlier in the week, protesters in Nakhodka blockaded a highway to protest electricity reductions. (NYT)</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: GENERALS CHARGED  Colombia's attorney general accused four army generals and a colonel of allowing the 1997 massacre of 18 villagers in the town of Puerto Alvira by a rightist paramilitary group. It was the second announcement this week implicating senior officers in a massacre. The army angrily denounced the investigations, saying they were sapping military morale.  (AP)</p>
        <p>MEXICO: OVERTURE TO OPPOSITION  President-elect Vicente Fox met with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the leftist former Mexico City mayor who finished a distant third in July 2 presidential balloting. Mr. Fox said he apologized for harsh criticisms he may have made during the campaign and expressed hopes that some of Mr. Cardenas's associates would take part in his government. Mr. Cardenas remained noncommital.</p>

        <p>CANADA: JAILED AGAIN  An American who fled to Canada in 1971 to escape a four-year prison term for selling $20 worth of LSD will have to spend at least eight more months in a New York State jail before being eligible for parole, state parole officials say. Allen Richardson, 50, surrendered to American authorities last month.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>LEBANON: APPEAL FOR AID  Lebanon appealed to rich nations to help develop the south, saying failure to do so would destabilize the area after Israel's withdrawal. But Inder Sud, director of the World Bank for the Middle East, said it would be difficult to secure all of the $1.3 billion Lebanon is seeking.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>NORTH KOREA: ENDING ISOLATION  North Korea ended decades of isolation by joining the Asean regional forum, which includes the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and 13 other countries -- including the United States and Russia -- with security interests in Asia. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was to meet on Friday with Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun. She is expected to press him for details on the North's recent offer to turn its ballistic missile program into one focused on the peaceful launching of satellites.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: PROTESTING SUHARTO  Thousands of  Indonesians marched through Jakarta in protests against Suharto as the former president's lawyers said he was too brain-damaged to stand trial on corruption charges. A large group of protesters marched from Mr. Suharto's city bungalow, where the ailing 79-year-old has been under house arrest for almost two months, through the city to join another group carrying an effigy of Mr. Suharto depicted as a devil, above.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: FARMERS APPEAL TO COURT  The Commercial Farmers Union, which represents the country's 4,000 white commercial farmers, asked the High Court to hold the national police chief in contempt for failing to remove black squatters who still occupy more than 1,000 white-owned farms. The police chief and others have flouted a March court order requiring the squatters to leave.</p>

        <p>ANGOLA: ILLEGAL DIAMONDS  Britain accused the Angolan rebel movement led by Jonas Savimbi of continuing to break a United Nations embargo on the sale of diamonds to finance its long-running war against the government. The Foreign Office said the sales had been conducted in Libreville, the capital of Gabon. The United Nations sought to impose a ban on diamond sales by the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in 1998.</p>
