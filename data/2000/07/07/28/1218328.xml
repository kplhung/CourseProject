        <p>Despite his apparent desire to resume his career before next season, Darryl Strawberry will not gain early reinstatement from his one-year suspension for violation of baseball's drug policy.</p>
        <p>Strawberry was quoted in The Daily News yesterday as saying he had applied for early reinstatement. However, the decision by Commissioner Bud Selig to ban the former Mets and Yankees outfielder for the 2000 season included no provision for having the suspension shortened. A baseball official said yesterday that Strawberry wrote a letter to Selig a few weeks ago but then basically withdrew it.</p>

A baseball official said yesterday that Strawberry wrote a letter to Selig a few weeks ago but then basically withdrew it.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, 38, was suspended last February after testing positive for cocaine use in a drug test under terms of his probation from a previous discipline. He was suspended for 120 days last year after pleading no contest to drug and solicitation charges resulting from an arrest in Florida in April 1999.</p>
