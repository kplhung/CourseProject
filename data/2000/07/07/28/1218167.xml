        <p>The French modern-dance choreographer Mathilde Monnier has been a major link to emerging experimental dance in Africa. ''Pour Antigone,'' which she choreographed in 1991, is the final dance event in Lincoln Center Festival 2000, and it is a landmark work in this new cross-pollination.</p>
        <p>During much of ''Pour Antigone,'' which had its New York premiere on Wednesday night at La Guardia High School, two sets of dancers keep apart. The first group consists of performers from Africa: three female and two male dancers and a virtuoso drummer. The white performers in the second group include a male American dancer and four Europeans (three women and one man).</p>
        <p>That those groups are eventually integrated, even in partnering, is not only predictable; it is also symbolic of a theme that is highly oblique, as is common to Ms. Monnier. On another level, integration signifies unity, possibly even the catharsis associated with the Greek myth of Antigone, daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta.</p>
        <p>Antigone is nowhere to be seen onstage, but she is sensed in her multiple aspects. Ms. Monnier's springboard was Sophocles' tragedy ''Antigone,'' whose heroine buries her slain brother Polynices in defiance of her uncle, Creon, ruler of Thebes, who considers him a traitor. After Creon  condemns her to be buried alive in punishment, she commits suicide.</p>
        <p>In ''Pour Antigone,'' which will be repeated tonight and tomorrow at La Guardia High School (100 Amsterdam Avenue, at 64th Street), the highly individualized performers keep changing costumes. Eventually all wind up in shades of red. Can one say that the integration of the groups into a unified whole relates to a blood ritual? The same red blood courses through the veins of all mankind. The healing at the end has the casual style of the piece's beginning.</p>
        <p>Like much of Ms. Monnier's work, this one is open to interpretation or even no interpretation. Its weakness is paradoxically its strength: discrete episodes have impact, but their cumulative aspect is questionable.</p>
        <p>Yet some people in the audience called the work wonderful -- which is true of the energy and wit found in specific moments.</p>
        <p>With ''Pour Antigone'' Ms. Monnier began a collaboration with dancers she met in Mali and Burkina Faso. Some went to France to study in workshops with her company, now based in Montpellier, and joined her troupe or returned home to form troupes of their own.</p>
        <p>This is true of her two male dancers from Burkina Faso, Salia Sanou and Seydou Boro, whose company performed in September at the International New Dance Festival in Montreal.</p>
        <p>The revelation of that festival was the number of choreographers in Africa who use their background in traditional dance to experiment in contemporary ways. Ms. Monnier was one of the first to encourage their postmodern brand of eclecticism, which also runs through ''Pour Antigone.'' Among others who studied with her is Gnapa Beatrice Kombe, whose stunning Tchetche Company in Ivory Coast was also in Montreal.</p>
        <p>Ronald K. Brown, who has worked with the Sylvain Zabli Company in Ivory Coast, and Ralph Lemon are American experimental choreographers who have collaborated with African dancers. The German neo-expressionist Susanne Linke will include dancers from Senegal when her company, Jant-Bi, appears at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., from Aug. 9 to 13.</p>
        <p>''Pour Antigone'' can thus be seen in a context that Ms. Monnier did much to create. It is to her credit that she has not turned her African collaborators into clones of her white performers, who move in the stylized collage structures she inherited from her American mentor, Viola Farber, once Merce Cunningham's partner.</p>
        <p>The work opens with a striking decor by Annie Tolleter, corrugated walls lighted by Eric Wurtz and with costumes by Christine Vargas. Two women pursue a long-distance dialogue at opposite corners of the stage. Their African syllables are emphatic, often repetitive. Blandine Yameogo, who also sings occasionally, and Balguissa Zoungrana, sitting under a lamp, are very much of our time. They lounge on abandoned car seats.</p>
        <p>After they begin a stamping dance, varied in gait and postures, the three European women -- Corinne Garcia, Germana Civera and Eszter Salamon -- rush out in short tunics and clunky shoes to stamp out their geometric minimalist reply.</p>
        <p>The contrasting dynamics are obvious: outlined shapes for the Europeans, performed with darting speed, while the self-contained African solos have the looser dynamic of traditional African dance and are packed with steps.</p>
        <p>Weaving throughout the work is Zani Diabate, a drummer of nuance and humor who triumphs over the electronic rumbles of Christophe Sechet and who ushers in Mr. Boro as a kingly figure. Mr. Sanou, something of a Polynices, haunts the piece like a spirit with a resiliency in his dancing that is amplified by the rest of the cast as it lies on the floor and bounces up from it.</p>
        <p>Awa Kouyate, a woman who closes the piece in a healing water ritual, moves with elegance, and Joel Luecht, the American, appears occasionally wrapped like a mummy in white cloth. Dimitri Chamblas, tall, quick and able to carve every shape into space with power and energy, is a galvanizing force.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Monnier brings in four toy soldiers to be moved around the floor, and Mr. Luecht stands on the head of a soldier figure, her references to colonial or postcolonial rule take the wind out of her wonderful chaotic sails. Herman Diephuis is listed as assistant choreographer for a piece that nonetheless meanders in and out of magic places.</p>
