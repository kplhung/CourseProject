        <p>MANHATTAN: SEXUAL PREDATOR SOUGHT -- An Upper East Side woman was sexually assaulted yesterday by a man the police think is haunting an area between East 91st and 93rd Streets in search of women alone. The attack, in which the woman was followed into a brownstone vestibule and forced to perform oral sex, was similar to one May 30, and the police say they believe the suspect has made at least four other attempts on women in the area. The police said the attacks were not related to other sexual assaults. ''He's definitely not the East Side rapist,'' Deputy Inspector John Cutter said. The man is described as a dark-complexioned black man between 20 and 25 years old, around 5 feet 8 inches tall and about 165 pounds.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAYOR TO GO TO CONVENTION -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who snubbed the 1996 Republican National Convention, plans to go to Philadelphia next week to attend this year's event. ''I am not giving a speech,'' the mayor said yesterday, adding only that, ''There are a few things I am going to do.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani had said only, ''I am going to hang around.''</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PHONE WORKERS VOTE TO STRIKE -- Members of the Communications Workers of America voted yesterday to authorize their leaders to call a strike at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 6 if a settlement is not reached with Verizon Communications, the name Bell Atlantic adopted after acquiring the operations of G.T.E. The union, which represents 72,500 Verizon workers in the Northeast, is demanding better job security, less forced overtime and expedited ways to unionize the company's wireless-telephone workers.</p>

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: SPANO MAY HAVE TICK ILLNESS -- Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, is being treated for a newly recognized tick-borne disease called ehrilichiosis. Like Lyme disease, it is caused by a bacterium transmitted by the deer tick, and can produce fever, vomiting and weight loss. Although Mr. Spano's test results are not in, his doctor began treatment about three weeks ago, said a spokeswoman, Donna Greene.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: Y.M.C.A. MAY BUY ARMORY SITE -- The McBurney Y.M.C.A., whose building on West 23rd Street is for sale, has signed a letter of intent to move to the site of the old 14th Street Armory, which was demolished in April. The Y would be part of a complex on the 67,000-square-foot site that would include a luxury rental tower with 180 apartments, 20 percent of them to be reserved for low-income tenants.</p>

        <p>NEW CITY: INDICTMENT IN 'VAMPIRE' ASSAULT -- A man charged with trying to drive a stake through his sleeping neighbor's chest was indicted yesterday on an attempted murder charge. The man, David Bolton, 45, who lives in a boarding house in Nanuet, was interrupted just as he was about to hammer a sharpened wooden cross into the chest of a fellow resident, Jeffrey Todd, 22, on July 19, the indictment says. Mr. Todd woke up just in time. ''This is right out of 'The Twilight Zone,' '' Detective Lt. Charles Delo said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PRISON GUARD SURRENDERS -- A state correction officer surrendered on Wednesday afternoon in the April 21 rape of a 16-year-old girl, the police said. They said the officer, Samuel Sneed, 40, who is assigned to the Bedford Hills correctional facility, had a relationship with the victim, who this month reported having had a sexual encounter with him.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: SETBACK FOR MILLSTONE FOES -- Environmental groups seeking to close the Millstone Nuclear Power Generating Station in Waterford suffered another setback yesterday. The Connecticut Supreme Court dismissed their claim that a 1998 settlement for $1.2 million between Northeast Utilities, the plant's operator, and the Department of Environmental Protection was so low it amounted to collusion. The settlement covered alleged Millstone violations of its water discharge permit. This week, the court ruled that the groups had no standing to bring complaints.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: APPEAL ON BEACH ACCESS -- The Connecticut Supreme Court agreed yesterday to hear Greenwich's appeal of an appellate court decision ordering the town to open its beach to nonresidents. Brendan P. Leydon, a lawyer who lives in Stamford, sued for access to the beach. He won in the Appellate Court after losing in Superior Court. The residents-only policy will remain in effect until the Supreme Court decision, probably during the winter.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: DAY CARE BILL SIGNED -- Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has signed a law requiring all day care workers to undergo background checks for possible criminal records. New employees have two weeks from their date of hire to begin the process, which can take up to eight weeks. Current employees and center owners are permitted to wait until renewal of their licenses, up to three years, to begin the check. Anyone who has been convicted of a sexual or violent crime is ''permanently disqualified.''</p>

        <p>SANDY HOOK: CRITICISM OF GORE -- Three days after Vice President Al Gore was endorsed for president by the Sierra Club, a New Jersey environmental group criticized him on ocean dumping. The group, Clean Ocean Action, sent Mr. Gore a letter on Wednesday, the fourth anniversary of an agreement he brokered in 1996 to limit dumping at the mud dump six miles off Sandy Hook. Clean Ocean Action signed onto the agreement, but now says the United States Environmental Protection Agency's standards undermine the agreement by allowing some dumping to continue. Mr. Gore supports the federal agency.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: REFERENDUM CHALLENGED -- The League of Women Voters has filed a legal complaint to block a November ballot question on how to pay for roads and mass transit, on the ground that it is unconstitutional. The referendum centers on a constitutional amendment that sets aside revenue from existing taxes on petroleum products (but not gasoline) as well as sales taxes to help pay for a four-year $4 billion trust fund for transportation projects. In the action filed in State Superior Court in Mercer County, the League argues that there should be two amendments and two ballot questions -- one for each tax.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: POLL CRITICIZES WHITMAN -- A Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday found that four out of five New Jersey voters say Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's decision to frisk a black man was a ''bad idea.'' By a 78-to-14 percent margin, voters said they had a negative opinion of Governor Whitman's action, captured in a 1996 photo and published this month. Governor Whitman herself has called the pat-down search ''dumb,'' but has refused so far to apologize.The poll surveyed 910 registered voters from July 19 to 24.</p>

        <p>Correction:  July 29, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Metro Briefing column yesterday about a new home for the McBurney Y.M.C.A. on the site of the old 14th Street Armory in Manhattan referred incorrectly to the space being purchased. The Y.M.C.A. will buy 67,000 square feet on two floors of a two-building complex totaling 350,000 square feet; it is not purchasing the armory site.</p>
        <p>Also because of an editing error, the report misidentified the signer of a letter of intent for the space. It was the parent Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York, not McBurney itself.</p>
        <p>The report also included an erroneous figure from the developer for the number of rental apartments in the complex. It is to be 225, not 180.</p>
