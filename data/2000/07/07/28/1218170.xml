        <p>HOW many flat tires would you expect to get driving around the world? The ''China Clipper,'' a 1949 Buick Super wood-paneled station wagon, handled the 20,000 overland miles with none.</p>
        <p>Pat and Mary Brooks of Marshalltown, Iowa, one of 10 American teams participating in the Around the World in 80 Days Motor Challenge sponsored by the Classic Rally Association, outfitted their car with eight-ply truck tires. Normal car tires are four-ply. The rally, which began May 1 at Tower Bridge in London, ended there last week.,</p>
        <p>''This is a marathon,'' Mr. Brooks said of the chase for a finishers medal. ''Sprinters don't fare as well at the end as they did in the beginning.''</p>
        <p>The Brookses, who received $10,000 in sponsorship money from Buick, finished 21st out of 29 entries in the division that covered cars from 1941 to the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Kelly and Bill Secrest, the only father-daughter team, were a last-minute entry without a sponsor, yet managed to finish third in the division for cars dating from 1940 and earlier. They were driving a borrowed 1935 Chrysler Airflow.</p>
        <p>''I've been rallying since 1961,'' Mr. Secrest, a retired Trans World Airline pilot from South Shore, Ky., said in an interview earlier this month while driving through Morocco. ''I knew it would eat me alive for the rest of my life if we didn't get in on this one.''</p>
        <p>Kelly Secrest is a Massachusetts state trooper from Gloucester.</p>
        <p>The drivers traveled east across Europe and Asia, generally following Marco Polo's fabled silk route. The cars were airlifted from Beijing to Anchorage, driven down the West Coast from Alaska, then through the northern United States, a route that included small cities like Shelby, Mont., and Marquette, Mich.</p>
        <p>The cars were again airlifted from Newark to Marrakesh, Morocco, to finish the race.</p>
        <p>This is only the second rally to circumnavigate the world. The first was the 1908 around-the-world race that traveled west from New York to Paris and was won by an American, Thomas Flyer.</p>
        <p>The Brookses -- Pat is a lawyer and Mary is a retired social worker -- bought their car four years ago; it had 43,000 miles on it then. Although its tires remained intact during the rally, it suffered other ills. On Day 3, the Secrests lost their brakes in the French Alps, which caused the car to overheat and catch on fire, with no serious consequences. Later, a rear wheel bearing burned out in Alaska. The Brookses didn't have the correct tool to fix it.</p>
        <p>''We broke down next to a dilapidated, abandoned building,'' Mr. Brooks said. ''There was a huge pile of debris. We found an old pipe and pounded that bearing out.''</p>
        <p>Among the nonmechanical problems that arose as 42 cars, 40 of which actually finished, circled the globe were difficulties with customs officials in Turkey, a rerouting by the Chinese government and very poor roads in the Republic of Georgia. In Turkey, for reasons that remained mysterious to the competitors, local residents threw stones at the cars after dark.</p>
        <p>Most of the drive, though, was a return to basics.</p>
        <p>''It's a very simple life,'' Mrs. Brooks said. ''You only have one task to do: follow the route. You just drive.''</p>
