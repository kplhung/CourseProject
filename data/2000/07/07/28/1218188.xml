        <p>Sometimes, even the presence of an independent monitor -- studiously staying aloof from issues that may make a mockery of a building's sense of being a cooperative -- cannot quell the passions aroused by the annual shareholders' meeting and election of the board.</p>
        <p>But the folks at the Co-op Election Company and the Honest Ballot Association, two groups that conduct about 200 co-op and condominium elections a year in New York City, do try -- and usually succeed.</p>
        <p>Usually.</p>
        <p>''There was one meeting about five years ago,'' said Maralin Falik, executive director of the Honest Ballot Association, ''where we had to have armed guards. I'm not kidding.''</p>
        <p>It was ''a fancy Fifth Avenue building,'' Ms. Falik said, declining to be specific, ''and the meeting was nearby, in a private club.''</p>
        <p>The meeting and vote went smoothly, it seemed. ''But when everyone got back to the building, somebody had put Krazy Glue in every lock, about 100 doors, and no one could get into their apartments,'' Ms. Falik said. ''Somebody stayed back to do the dirty work.'' (The suspicion centered, she said, on a shareholder who had become something of a pariah because he would not dismantle a leaking hot tub that damaged an entire line of apartments.)</p>
        <p>Kelly Brier, executive director of the Co-op Election Company, said she and her colleagues have ''walked into meetings where shareholders were screaming, swearing, kicking doors, punching each other.''</p>
        <p>More often, however, the impartial representatives of the companies bring a measure of assurance to what can be a complicated and combative proceeding.</p>
        <p>While most buildings manage to conduct their meetings on their own, said Stuart Saft, chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, ''we try to bring the companies in when we know in advance that there is going to be a contentious election, or in very large buildings where it would be next to impossible to tabulate all the votes.''</p>
        <p>''Nobody can accuse them of taking sides,'' Mr. Saft said. ''They're basically hired guns.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brier said: ''Our job is to remain impartial. We're not involved in a building's issues.''</p>
        <p>The companies provide either specific services or an entire election. ''When a co-op has an annual meeting, we can help the board write the notice, design the proxy vote form, do the mailings,'' Ms. Brier said. Using documents from the management office, the companies verify proxy signatures -- a vital function, particularly in hotly contested elections in which abuse is possible.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, they register voters, maintain the ballot boxes and, perhaps most consequentially, tabulate the votes independently. The process can be quite complicated, particularly when a building's bylaws call for cumulative voting. In that method, an apartment owner's shares are multiplied by the number of board seats up for election. For example, if the apartment is valued at 100 shares and 5 seats are on the ballot, the owner can give all 500 votes to one candidate or spread them around.</p>
        <p>''And there is an equally complicated situation in condominiums,'' Mr. Saft said, ''because your vote is not based on shares, but percentage interest in the common elements -- the elevators, the lobby, the swimming pool.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Brier put it, ''You own a half-gallon of the pool.''</p>
        <p>Citing Parkchester South in the Bronx, which has 8,300 apartments, Mr. Saft said, ''each owner's percentage is infinitesimal,'' far too difficult to tabulate by hand.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, one faction in a building sues to contest the election, and the companies are ordered in by a court. ''There are times I have to hold the keys and checkbook from the management office,'' Ms. Falik said, ''because there's going to be a revote and the challengers are afraid the people up for removal will start writing checks, signing contracts.''</p>
        <p>While the Co-op Election Company only conducts co-op and condominium elections, the Honest Ballot Association also handles union votes, prize contests and asset distribution -- as when general partners in a co-op sponsorship dissolve the company and the apartments they own have to be divided.</p>
        <p>Particularly satisfying are lotteries for people seeking placement in housing they can afford. ''You feel you're changing their lives,'' Ms. Falik said. ''I've found notes on entry forms saying, 'You'll save my life,' 'I pray I'll get on the list.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brier said there were, essentially, two voting seasons for co-ops and condos: March through June, and September through November. And depending on a building's size and other factors, the cost to run an election can range from $1,000 to $30,000. Ms. Falik recalled that the price for one development hit $75,000, because it had 15,000 apartments and required multiple mailings and a complicated voting process.</p>
        <p>Among the companies' most important tasks is ensuring a quorum: no quorum, no election. ''This year, we put out an incentive in one building,'' Ms. Falik said, free maintenance for a month for people who voted early. ''We had a quorum within a week of the mailing.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 1, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, the Residential Real Estate column on Friday about groups that manage condominium and co-op board elections misstated an incentive used by one group, the Honest Ballot Association, to encourage participation. Residents who vote early are entered in a lottery for a free maintenance payment; they do not all receive the free month.</p>
