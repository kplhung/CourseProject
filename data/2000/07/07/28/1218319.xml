        <p>After spraying Central Park, Staten Island and parts of Queens with the pesticide Anvil, the city prepared last night to begin ground spraying on the streets of Manhattan, concluding a weeklong campaign aimed at stamping out the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The spraying, which was delayed by a day because of heavy rains on Wednesday, was to cover every block from 23rd Street to 110th Street between the Hudson and East Rivers, as well as Roosevelt Island.</p>
        <p>The mosquito-borne virus killed 7 people in the New York region last year and made 55 others seriously ill. No human cases have been reported this year, but the virus has been found in 11 mosquito samples in the region and in more than 50 birds in New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>As environmentalists continued yesterday to protest the use of pesticides, which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has vociferously defended as the best way to prevent the spread of the virus, residents of the areas in Manhattan to be sprayed anticipated it with a mixture of relief, nervousness and nonchalance.</p>
        <p>''I think the bus exhaust is worse than the mosquito spraying,'' said Steven van Leeuwen, who lives on West 85th Street. ''I think we live in a city with very bad air, and whatever the city tries to add to it is not going to make it that much worse.''</p>
        <p>As Heather Conner walked into her apartment building on West 69th Street yesterday, she said: ''I'm pregnant and I'm not too worried about it.''</p>
        <p>But others said they thought the city, in deciding to spray such a large section of Manhattan after finding that mosquitoes in a Central Park pool had tested positive for the virus, was taking an extreme approach.</p>
        <p>''This whole thing is just bizarre,'' said Elayne Fischzang, 32, a preschool teacher who lives on Amsterdam Avenue and 107th Street and who bought a fan yesterday because she planned to keep her windows shut overnight during the spraying.</p>
        <p>J. P. Park, the manager of Smiler's, a 24-hour deli on 48th Street and Seventh Avenue, where fruits, vegetables and fresh flowers were displayed on outdoor stands, said he had not heard about the spraying. ''I guess I'll have to cover everything with plastic,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The spraying is intended to kill the culex pipiens mosquito, the species that carries the virus and is most active between dusk and dawn. The city is using Anvil, similar to a natural pesticide produced by chrysanthemum flowers.</p>
        <p>Nassau County officials said yesterday that they had found a third crow, in Plainview, infected with West Nile virus, but that they still had no plans to spray.</p>
