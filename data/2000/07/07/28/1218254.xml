      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The proposed Republican platform would drop several of the more hard-edged conservative positions adopted four years ago -- like calling for the abolition of the Department of Education  -- and transform much of the document's tone to reflect the ''compassionate conservatism'' of Gov. George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>But it also reflects the continuing power of the party's conservative base, most notably in its word-by-word reaffirmation of the abortion plank, calling for a ban on abortion  with no exceptions and the appointment of judges who ''respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.''</p>
        <p>The draft of the platform was written under the guidance of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the platform committee chairman, and was distributed to members of the platform committee gathering here tonight. It will be reviewed -- possibly rewritten -- and voted upon by the 107-member platform committee over the next two days. The full convention will consider the resulting product on Monday.</p>
        <p>Governor Thompson said tonight that he hoped the draft reflected ''a more uplifting view of the Republican Party, one that's more inclusive, that attempts to build a winning team, that people can rally around.''  He said it was also intended to reflect the Bush philosophy, adding that he took the chairman's job ''because my friend the governor asked me to do it.''</p>
        <p>Asked how much he expected the committee to change this draft, Mr. Thompson said, ''I hope not much, but I know some.''</p>
        <p>Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said tonight that Republicans were simply putting ''compassionate conservative wrapping paper'' around the same old conservative dogma.  She argued that the platform's changes were ''around the margins'' and asserted, ''If the American people wanted one sign that the Republican Party had moved out of the 19th century, it would have been some understanding that American women want the right to choose protected.''</p>
        <p>As written, the document is in large part a road map of the Bush campaign's political strategy in the general election. The section on immigration, for example, no longer demands a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the children born of illegal immigrants, as it did four years ago. Rather than calling for ''the official recognition of English as the nation's common language,'' it declares, ''Another sign of our unity is the role of English as our common language.''  The tone, in general, is far more welcoming, reflecting Republicans' efforts to reach out to Hispanics and other immigrant groups.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the document includes a careful appeal to women, pledging the party's commitment to women's health issues, and to the elderly, considered a critical swing vote this year. It promises to give Medicare ''a new lease on life,'' by giving each of its 39 million beneficiaries a choice of health plans, an allusion to efforts to get more private insurance plans involved in Medicare. And it accuses the Clinton administration of treating ''Social Security as a slogan rather than a priority,'' while heralding Mr. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>Still, for all these appeals to voters in the center, this is hardly a rebuttal of conservative orthodoxy. The platform reiterates that ''we defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms'' and argues that ''self-defense is a basic human right.'' The answer to gun violence, it argues, is stronger enforcement of existing laws.</p>
        <p>The platform attacks the Supreme Court's recent decision overturning state laws that barred what opponents call ''partial-birth'' abortion, asserting that the decision ''shocks the conscience of the nation.'' And while Mr. Bush says he would allow abortions in the case of rape, incest and to save the life of the woman, the platform remains unswervingly opposed. Mr. Bush and other Republican leaders had promised the anti-abortion movement early on that the abortion plank would not change.</p>
        <p>Republican aides said the document was intended to sound a far less combative tone than the 1996 platform, which is in keeping with the Bush campaign's effort to present its candidate as ''a uniter, not a divider.'' At times, the references are opaque: In a section titled, ''Government for the People,'' the draft is apparently referring to the impeachment of Mr. Clinton when it declares: ''At a time when the nation felt betrayed by misconduct in high office, the Republican Congress responded with gravity and high purpose. We applaud those members who did their duty to conscience and the Constitution.''</p>
        <p>The platform goes to great lengths, though, to try to build a case against giving the Democrats any credit for the current economic boom. It argues that the economy was a ''shambles'' under President Jimmy Carter, was saved by the Reagan and Bush administrations, and was jeopardized anew by the election of the Clinton administration in 1992, although that election occurred in a recession. Only the ''honesty and guts'' of a Republican Congress managed to erase the budget deficit and steady the economy for this  boom, the platform draft declares.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, when that Republican-controlled Congress was still in full-cry, the platform called for the elimination of the Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Education and Energy. This draft generally calls for ''downsizing'' of the ''mess'' in Washington, where there are ''too many departments and agencies with competing programs that waste resources and fail to deliver the goods.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said the draft was written by the staff of the Republican National Committee, the Bush campaign and his own operation, under the guidance of him and his two co-chairs, Representative Sue Myrick of North Carolina and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Some of the most scathing criticism in the draft comes in the section on foreign policy, where the administration is accused of mishandling crises from the Balkans to Mexico.</p>
        <p>''Reacting belatedly to inevitable crises, the administration constantly enlarges the reach of its rhetoric --  most recently in Vice President Al Gore's 'new security agenda' that adds disease, climate and all the world's ethnic or religious conflicts to an undiminished set of existing American responsibilities. If there is some limit to candidate Gore's new agenda for America as global social worker, he has yet to define it,'' the draft declares.</p>
        <p>''It is time for America to regain its focus,'' it adds.</p>
        <p>Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, responded, ''Sounds like the Republicans are turning back the clock to the days of isolationism and a head-in-the-sand view of the world. It's only common sense to address these problems before they develop into conflicts.''</p>
        <p>The platform draft also takes aim at Mr. Gore's environmental initiatives, arguing that a Republican president will reduce harmful emissions without ''forcing Americans to walk to work.''</p>
