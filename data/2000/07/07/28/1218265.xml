        <p>''We don't need Dad in this race,'' George W. Bush told The Midland Reporter-Telegram back in 1978, when he was making an unsuccessful run for Congress and being questioned about the views of his already famous father. But in the world of oedipal politics, keeping dad out of the campaign can be a difficult task, as Governor Bush and countless other famous sons have discovered over the years.</p>
        <p>Indeed, American campaigns sometimes seem to resemble one of those men's-movement fables from ''Iron John'' in which the son can achieve full masculine power only by vanquishing the father's ghost. As a practical matter, of course, ghosts can be easier to deal with than a living, meddling father or public suspicions about paternal string-pulling. American voters seem to like political dynasties -- up to that point where the romance of father-son continuity seems to verge on something resembling royal entitlement.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the few traits that Governor Bush and Vice President Al Gore seem to have in common is the dilemma of being the son of a famous politician. Mr. Bush probably has the harder task in containing the offstage presence of a very lively 76-year-old  former president. But Mr. Gore's candidacy is haunted, in a way, by the golden-throated ghost of Senator Albert Gore Sr., who died in 1998.</p>
        <p>In the South, political scions from Herman (son of Ol' Gene) Talmadge to George Wallace Jr. have labored to avoid the appearance of having been foisted on the public. In that respect, it was probably less than helpful when the elder Mr. Gore, asked in 1992 about his son's presence on the Democratic national ticket, said, ''We raised him for it.''</p>
        <p>Even today, the father's reputation competes with the son's reality. Albert Gore Sr. was a famous orator. The son turns to stone at the teleprompter. Vice President Gore is accused of pandering. Senior lost his Senate seat rather than alter his opposition to the Vietnam War. The father had the advantage of an impoverished Tennessee boyhood. Albert Gore Jr. used their Tennessee farm as a summer camp.</p>
        <p>For all that, Governor Bush faces the tougher, day-to-day threat of being miniaturized by a living ex-president. The elder Mr. Bush inflicted unintended collateral damage at a rally before the New Hampshire primary by referring to his son as ''this boy.'' In a subsequent interview with The New York Times, President Bush and his wife, Barbara, took what appeared to be a pledge of non-interference.</p>
        <p>But family discipline seemed to break down during the process of putting Dick Cheney on the ticket. Governor Bush acknowledged ''kibitzing'' by his father, apparently code for days of lobbying by the former president for his secretary of defense. A fatherly call to the elderly Texas heart surgeon Denton Cooley about Mr. Cheney's health was also made public.</p>
        <p>President Bush, in damage-control mode, said yesterday that it was ''absolutely inaccurate'' to say he had driven the choice of Mr. Cheney. But in fact the whole process took on a very retro, Texas-elite, Bush-senior look. The psychological signal was even more damaging, as if by pushing Mr. Cheney President Bush was saying, Don't worry: when my son makes decisions, adults will be in the room.</p>
        <p>Were John F. Kennedy alive, he  could certainly identify with the problem of paternal-assistance overload. Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.'s bootlegger image and his reputation for being soft on Nazi Germany made it essential to keep him in the background. But the old man's public ambition to put a son in the White House and the jokes about his not paying for a single vote more than necessary made that a hard task. Indeed, the elder Kennedy's triumphal behavior at J.F.K.'s inaugural was enough to make one wonder whose day it was -- at least in Joseph Kennedy's mind.</p>
        <p>When it comes to fathers, there is, of course, a counter-tradition in postwar presidential politics. Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were all figures who were, in a political sense, fatherless. Truman had made his bones in machine politics. Eisenhower, through his war experience, entered elective combat with the status of national father figure. It was impossible to imagine the supreme allied commander playing junior to any man, even back in Abilene.</p>
        <p>Some, like Johnson, Nixon and Reagan, pitied their fathers for their weaknesses. Others, notably Jimmy Carter, revered their fathers' rectitude. Mr. Ford and Mr. Clinton were estranged by death and circumstance from their biological fathers. All had, by the time they ran for president, far surpassed the paternal example of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gore is quite there yet. True, Mr. Gore now outranks his father, but he is not yet perceived as having made the step from scion to paterfamilias. That could argue for picking a junior figure for a running mate. Mr. Bush has gone in the other direction, putting a de facto father on the ticket at the urging of his real father in Houston. Governor Bush cites this as proof of his inner security, and it may be. But he still has to worry that voters will read it as a sign of a son not yet risen to full autonomy.</p>
