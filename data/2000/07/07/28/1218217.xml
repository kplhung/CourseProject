        <p>Lawyers for Napster asked a federal court here today to stay a preliminary injunction issued by a judge on Wednesday, asserting that the injunction will effectively put the Internet service, which permits computer users to freely exchange music, out of business.</p>

        <p>Lawyers for Napster asked a federal court here today to stay a preliminary injunction issued by a judge on Wednesday, asserting that the injunction will effectively put the Internet service, which permits computer users to freely exchange music, out of business.</p>
        <p>In their brief, filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Napster lawyers argued that Chief Judge Marilyn Patel of the United States District Court overstepped her authority by seeking to extend copyright law to a new technology. The brief also argued that Judge Patel, in the 90-minute hearing, did not consider all of the evidence, including studies that contend that Napster helps, rather than hinders, record sales.</p>
        <p>''They're throwing the same reasoning at court of appeals they tried at the judge,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, the industry group that had sought the injunction. ''The judge's reasoning was solid and this won't be successful,'' she said of the appeal.</p>
        <p>The injunction, which is to take effect on Friday at midnight, precludes Napster from allowing its users to exchange copyrighted music owned by the major record labels, pending a trial. Napster says the injunction effectively will put it out of business since it cannot distinguish permitted exchanges from banned ones. No trial date has yet been set.</p>
        <p>Although the record industry praised the judge's action on Wednesday, their celebration was tempered by what analysts say is an imposing challenge: putting their own businesses online to meet a demand for music that Napster so clearly demonstrated.</p>
        <p>''They have got to fill the vacuum,'' said Michael B. Nathanson, a record industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, the securities firm. ''They just can't keep stopping these things. They've got to be aggressive over the next 6 to 12 months'' in making their music available online.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nathanson and industry executives have been speaking in such urgent tones for the last two years, and, in some cases by their own admission, they have little to show for it. The major record labels have begun selling some music, mostly singles, for download, and are exploring subscription-based sites in which visitors could pay a fee to download music.</p>
        <p>Sony, for instance, has roughly 50 songs available for download, selling them for $2.49 each. The company has a partnership with Universal Music Group to develop a subscription-based model. EMI, another major record label, has begun making downloads available, and will soon sell singles for $3.49 and full albums for $17.95 on a site called musicmaker.com.</p>
        <p>The labels say they have aggressively pursued strategies for distributing music online, striking business deals with music sites, working to develop secure technology, and exploring new business models. But the challenge is daunting because they want to create encryption technology that will prevent their music from being freely exchanged. They assert that Napster makes online music distribution look deceivingly easy because it facilitates the free exchange of songs; the service says 20 million users have downloaded its free file-sharing software, and recording industry lawyers say 14,000 songs change hands each minute.</p>
        <p>''People have to be realistic; we're not going to re-create Napster overnight,'' said Ms. Rosen of the Recording Industry Association.</p>
        <p>But they might eventually recreate a service similar to Napster, or even purchase Napster itself, people within the record industry say.</p>
        <p>A person at one of the major record labels said that most, if not all, of the labels have considered purchasing Napster and finding a way to license the content exchanged by users. But that person said that the labels appear not to be able to find a way to make the service profitable while permitting the wide exchange of content that has made it so popular.</p>
