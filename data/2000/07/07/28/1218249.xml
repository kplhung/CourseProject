        <p>Part of a retaining wall at a Midtown construction site collapsed yesterday morning, disrupting rush-hour subway service and traffic north of Times Square for several hours.</p>
        <p>No one was injured in the relatively minor collapse, at the northwest corner of Broadway and 55th Street, but it led to delays for thousands of subway riders, as transit officials shut down service on portions of the 1, 2, 3, 9, A, B, C, D and Q lines on the West Side and police officials closed parts of Broadway near the site of the collapse.</p>
        <p>''There was a partial collapse of a retaining wall on the 55th Street side,'' about 8:45 a.m., said Thomas Dunne, the deputy chief in charge of the Fire Department's Third Division. ''We don't know what caused it but we are investigating.''</p>
        <p>The retaining wall was one that provided a temporary frame for the foundation of the building about to rise on the site, which covers the entire west side of Broadway from 55th to 56th Streets.</p>
        <p>The building, an 850,000-square-foot tower being developed by Related Companies, will be the headquarters of Random House.</p>
        <p>Fire Department officials quickly established that none of the dozens of construction workers at the site were injured and then began shoring up the 40-foot section of wall that collapsed.</p>
        <p>Paul Wein, a spokesman for the city's Department of Buildings, said that building inspectors ordered the owner of the property, 56 St. Assoc., L.L.C. to stop construction until the wall was shored up and the contractor provided an acceptable plan to prevent further problems.</p>
        <p>Subway service was disrupted because city officials, concerned about vibrations causing a further collapse, asked New York City Transit to stop trains running under Broadway, the Avenue of the Americas, and Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Trains were stopped at 9:28 a.m. Restricted service, with trains traveling no more than 10 miles per hour, resumed at 9:55 a.m. Full service was restored by 11:15 a.m, transit officials said.</p>
        <p>For riders like Rana Dershowitz, a Manhattan lawyer, the morning trip to work became an ordeal. Her normal 15-minute subway ride from West 86th Street turned into a much longer trip. She was greeted at her  station by commuters leaving, warning her that the trains were not running.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dershowitz hopped on a bus,  but it became snarled in traffic at West 65th Street. The bus driver's jokes helped keep everyone in ''surprisingly good spirits,'' Ms. Dershowitz said. But she gave up after 15 minutes, she said, got off the bus and walked the last 10 blocks to her office.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in Midtown, buses overloaded with passengers passed by people waiting at stops. Last month an engineer for the Moderne Hotel on 55th Street reported that he had found cracks running from the basement to the roof of the six-story hotel. The damage was so severe that the elevator shafts and building itself had slid slightly, the engineer, Lewis L. Zickel, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zickel said he had not yet concluded that the hotel's problems were related to the construction.</p>
        <p>''It is unclear, but my experience tells me that adjacent construction does have some impact on the adjoining building,'' Mr. Zickel said.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Wein said, when fire and buildings department officials inspected both the hotel and the construction site, they found ''a couple of cracks, but it was not in imminent danger of collapse and there was no reason to vacate.''</p>
        <p>Still, Moderne officials evacuated the building on the recommendation of the engineer,</p>
        <p>Until recently, Related had planned to build an apartment house and hotel on the land.</p>
        <p>Plaza Construction Corporation has been hired to build the office space and the architectural firm of Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum to design it.</p>
