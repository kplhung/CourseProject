        <p>Swiss and American authorities have blocked Kazakhstan's government from access to bank accounts holding roughly $100 million that they suspect Western oil companies may have used to bribe senior Kazakh officials, according to officials with knowledge of the action.</p>
        <p>The Swiss froze the accounts, the officials say, but today a Swiss court lifted the blocking order on some accounts, lawyers involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Still, the court did not open the accounts to Kazakhstan, because they remain subject to parallel orders issued at the request of the American law enforcement authorities, who have begun their own inquiry.</p>
        <p>The Kazakh government had petitioned the courts to remove the freeze. Investigating magistrates in Geneva froze the accounts between June and October of last year.</p>
        <p>The banks involved include Credit Agricole Indosuez, the Swiss affiliate of a French bank, and Banque Pictet, a Geneva private bank. One of largest accounts at the Banque Pictet held about $84 million that was unfrozen by the Swiss judicial order, but remained off limits to the Kazakh government because of the American request, the lawyers said.</p>
        <p>Some of the accounts were available for the benefit of the Kazakh president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, as well as other officials and members of their families, officials said.</p>
        <p>The officials said that ''several dozen'' Kazakhstan accounts had been turned up by the investigation, though most were accounts of the Kazakh government and could not be frozen, and that fewer than 10 were personal accounts of Kazakh officials or family members.</p>
        <p>The Swiss officials said signers to some of the accounts included James H. Giffen, a New York consultant for oil and other trade deals in various regions of the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Giffen, Mark J. MacDougal, said today that the allegations of wrongdoing were undercut by today's Swiss judicial order.</p>
        <p>''These rulings by a court that has actually studied the evidence confirms that funds owned by the Republican of Kazakhstan have been wrongfully seized by Swiss authorities,'' Mr. MacDougal said.''We hope that this is a first step in correcting the false accusations directed toward the republic and Jim Giffen.''</p>
        <p>In June, the United States Justice Department said it had asked the Swiss for assistance in investigating the financial activities of Mr. Giffen, who has been an important adviser to Mr. Nazarbayev.</p>
        <p>The Swiss authorities said a Geneva investigating magistrate, Daniel Devaud, notified the Justice Department in January of suspicions that the accounts were financed by American and European oil companies as bribes to Kazakh officials.</p>
        <p>The suspicion, they said, was based at least partly on a pattern of clandestine and circuitous routes by which the money came to Switzerland, including foundations in Liechtenstein and shell companies in Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>Swiss officials said that bank records showed that deposits had been made by American and European oil companies, and that they had notified the Justice Department because of the likelihood that the payments could violate the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p>
        <p>The Swiss officials said investigators in Geneva had identified four large transactions, two of them involving American companies, and two others involving European oil companies they declined to identify.</p>
        <p>The accounts were frozen after the Kazakh government asked the Belgian authorities last year to investigate the assets in Belgium of a political opponent of Mr. Nazarbayev, former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin. In May the Belgians asked the Swiss for help with their inquiry.</p>
        <p>Swiss officials said account documents indicated that the money in the Swiss accounts had been available for the benefit of Mr. Nazarbayev, Mr. Kazhegeldin, 48, and Nurlan Balgimbayev, 52, Mr. Kazhegeldin's successor as prime minister and now the top official at Kazakhstan's state oil company.</p>
        <p>A June 12 Justice Department document identifies Mr. Giffen and his Mercator Corporation of New York as being under investigation on suspicion of improperly funneling to Kazakh officials money from the Phillips Petroleum Company; the former Mobil Corporation, now Exxon Mobil; and the former Amoco Corporation, now BP Amoco.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has said the oil companies are not a subject of the inquiry. Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco have said they are cooperating. Phillips has declined comment.</p>
        <p>Oil company officials have said they believe that the payments were at least in part standard payments to governments for oil contracts. The Russian news agency Interfax has quoted Mr. Balgimbayev as saying: ''I am clean. I guarantee it.''</p>
