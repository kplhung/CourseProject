        <p>There's an old saying on Wall Street: ''Never fall in love with your assets.'' What this really means is that you should be willing to trade everything you own -- for a price.</p>
        <p>Most collectors are too sentimental about their antiques to part with them readily, but a few collectors do. When they do, it is often for an unexpected reason, not greed.</p>
        <p>This seems to be the case with Virginia Ramsey-Pope Cave, an American folk art collector and former dealer from Dorset, Vt. On Aug. 5, Mrs. Cave is selling her personal folk art collection -- the contents of her house and barn -- at Northeast Auctions in Manchester, N.H. She has promised 10 percent of the proceeds to the Museum of American Folk Art, whose new building is under construction at 45 West 53rd Street in Manhattan. This is part of her effort, as head of a committee drawn from the folk-art trade, to raise $1 million for the museum's new library.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cave is retiring to Manhattan after spending 25 years in the business and rearing five children. ''This sale is the culmination of my years as a student, dealer and collector in this field,'' she said. ''These things have been part of my life in Vermont. Putting them back on the market was the best thing to do with them. You cannot skim the top. I'm selling it all. It isn't that I've lost my affinity for American folk art; it's just that that part of my life is over.''</p>
        <p>Ralph O. Esmerian, chairman of the museum's board, explained, ''The museum is an important part of her focus.'' He pointed out that it had raised only $24 million of $34 million needed for the entire project.</p>
        <p>''We've raised enough to build the building,'' he said. ''As for the library, the trade loved the idea of being related to the scholarship side of the museum.''</p>
        <p>The 400 items for sale range widely in content and quality. ''Virginia loves things that are artful and serious as well as things that make her smile,'' said Allan Katz, a folk art dealer in Woodbridge, Conn., who sold her some of the toys in the sale. ''She has an impeccable eye.''</p>
        <p>The sale includes antique card tables, Shaker chests of drawers, whirligigs, appliqued coverlets, hooked rugs, weather vanes, blanket chests and game boards. ''I used to buy things wherever I went,'' Mrs. Cave recalled. ''When I had a house in Georgia, I would just get in the car and go, for fun. I even bought folk art in London, at the Olympia Fair.''</p>
        <p>The catalog prepared for Mrs. Cave by Northeast Auctions has few estimates. Most lots will be sold without a reserve, the secret minimum price agreed upon by the seller and the auction house. ''That makes it nice, honest and clean,'' Mr. Katz said. ''I think the sale will do exceedingly well. There is an absolute shortage of material, and she hasn't held anything back. It's extremely unusual to have no reserves when a seller is still alive.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cave has also been careful to list the provenances on most items. Ronald Bourgeault, the auctioneer who owns Northeast Auctions and a longtime friend of Mrs. Cave's, said, ''Virginia wanted to have everyone's name in the catalog, including all the dealers and people in the trade, because they are the ones who will use the new library at the folk art museum.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bourgeault added that he planned to donate part of his commission to the museum as well. ''The more the excitement about the sale grows, the more I think I'm going to give,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of the best lots, acquired from the Manhattan gallery America Hurrah, is a pair of miniature painted whirligigs in the form of a man and  woman. Each wears a green and brown outfit and has green paddle arms. The figures, which had belonged to the collector Ben Mildwoff, were auctioned at Sotheby's to a private collector, Barry Cohen, who then gave them to America Hurrah, which sold them to Mrs. Cave. In good condition and with great charm, they are expected to sell for $40,000 to $60,000.</p>
        <p>A carved and painted Noah's ark, with an army of 200 animals and figures, was originally acquired from Mr. Katz. ''These were primarily religious toys,'' he said. ''They were the only toys that could be used on Sundays because they were biblical. This one is either German or Pennsylvania German and is in wonderful shape.'' The estimate is $4,000 to $6,000.</p>
        <p>Folk art paintings include an oil by Franklin Howard Bullis (1861-1937) depicting the passenger steamer Vermont approaching the Port Kent dock on Lake Champlain. A Vermont pennant and an American flag snap sharply in the wind beneath a blue sky dotted with scudding white clouds. A large ketch sails by the dock, which has kegs on it. A train chugs toward Burlington, barely visible in the background.</p>
        <p>''It's rare to find Vermont depicted in folk art,'' Mrs. Cave said. ''Vermont was not as sophisticated as Massachusetts or New York.'' She acquired the painting from Timothy J. Stevenson, a former dealer, and his partner, Phyllis Carlson, in Vermont. The estimate is $6,000 to $8,000.</p>
        <p>One of the most spectacular quilts in the sale is a 77-by-92-inch pieced and appliqued floral and feather coverlet signed Annie Sanford in ink. Its center has six large blocks, each depicting red roses and teal blue leaves and stems on a white ground. The border has a meandering motif of stylized flowers and feathers. ''I'm a gardener, so I'm attracted to floral quilts,'' Mrs. Cave said, ''but one with this French blue is very unusual.''</p>
        <p>The auction house offers neither a date nor an estimate, but since the quilt appears to be in good condition and is signed, it may be valuable.</p>
        <p>One of the highest estimates in the sale, $40,000 to $60,000, has been placed on a copper Goddess of Liberty weather vane with the label of J. W. Fiske Iron Works of New York, from about 1880 to 1893. This 17-inch-tall gilded goddess wears a Liberty cap decorated with a laurel wreath and holds an American flag with pierced stars and stripes. According to the catalog, it was found near Contoocook, N.H., and acquired by Mrs. Cave from David A. Schorsch, a dealer in Woodbury, Conn. Fiske produced cast-iron garden ornaments, benches and copper weather vanes for decades, which makes one wonder if such a mass-produced piece is truly a work of art.</p>
        <p>''None of these things were thought of as art when they were made,'' Mr. Esmerian said. ''They were functional and part of the daily lives of the people who built this country. We call it folk art, but they made these things for domestic use and practical purposes.</p>
        <p>''Fiske weather vanes were made to tell the direction of the wind. The makers took the time to make them special. It doesn't matter if there were 20 made. It's not only the unique object that we call folk art.''</p>
        <p>The Northeast Auctions viewing begins today through Monday at Treadwell House, 93 Pleasant Street, Portsmouth, N.H., (603) 627-6200. It continues at the Armory at the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn in Manchester, next Friday and Saturday, where the sale will be held on Saturday afternoon.</p>
