        <p>In spreading money around to New York State's 62 Republican county committees this month, Representative Rick Lazio has resorted to a legal but unsavory campaign scheme long favored by the state's political leaders. This ersatz philanthropy by a Senate candidate is simply another fund-raising gimmick. It is a way candidates for federal office can sidestep federal contribution limits in New York. And Mr. Lazio's use of that dodge is the latest signal that the State Legislature still needs to fix a campaign financing system that is nothing short of a national embarrassment.</p>
        <p>This particular ploy works when a candidate sets up a state political action committee ostensibly to nurture grass-roots campaigns and encourage local candidates. Under this state-approved guise, a donor can write a much larger check than for a federal campaign. An individual can contribute only $2,000 directly to Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example. But state law allows that same individual to contribute an additional $76,500 a year to Mr. Lazio's state PAC.</p>

        <p>In spreading money around to New York State's 62 Republican county committees this month, Representative Rick Lazio has resorted to a legal but unsavory campaign scheme long favored by the state's political leaders. This ersatz philanthropy by a Senate candidate is simply another fund-raising gimmick. It is a way candidates for federal office can sidestep federal contribution limits in New York. And Mr. Lazio's use of that dodge is the latest signal that the State Legislature still needs to fix a campaign financing system that is nothing short of a national embarrassment.</p>
        <p>This particular ploy works when a candidate sets up a state political action committee ostensibly to nurture grass-roots campaigns and encourage local candidates. Under this state-approved guise, a donor can write a much larger check than for a federal campaign. An individual can contribute only $2,000 directly to Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, for example. But state law allows that same individual to contribute an additional $76,500 a year to Mr. Lazio's state PAC.</p>
        <p>The PAC money cannot be used directly for a candidate's campaign, but a spokesman for Mr. Lazio said that the funds could be used to set up local phone banks and get out voters for all the party's candidates, including Mr. Lazio. Although the Lazio campaign protests that this PAC is separate, Clifford Levy of The Times reported this week that some donors contributed the maximum to Mr. Lazio's Senate campaign at the same time they contributed thousands more to his state PAC.</p>
        <p>The doling out of money to local parties is one of the quickest ways for a politician to gain statewide strength and recognition, either as a candidate or as a political rainmaker. Most recently in New Jersey, for example, Jon Corzine, the multimillionaire Democratic Senate candidate, spent tens of thousands of dollars of his own money to enrich local Democratic committees around the state. Local workers helped him thrash Jim Florio, the former governor, in the party primary last month.</p>
        <p>To be fair, Mr. Lazio's state PAC is not the only fund-raising contrivance that deprives New York voters of a fair contest this political season. Both the Lazio and Clinton campaigns are benefiting from unregulated contributions, or ''soft money,'' spent for them by national party committees. But Mr. Lazio's active PAC also offers the latest evidence that New York's Legislature prefers preserving  tainted fund-raising habits for another election year. Despite a few weak promises, legislators concluded their business in Albany this summer without making a single improvement in the worst state campaign finance system in the country.</p>
