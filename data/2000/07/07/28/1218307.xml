        <p>A worker at an Upper West Side supermarket was crushed to death by the store's cardboard-box compactor yesterday as he was loading boxes into it, the police said.</p>
        <p>The body of the worker, Raymundo Juarez-Cruz, an immigrant from Mexico, was discovered by an exterminator around 2 a.m. in the basement of the Westside Supermarket on Broadway near 110th Street. Emergency medical service workers pronounced Mr. Juarez-Cruz dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Elias Nikas of the Police Department said a safety switch on the compactor appeared to have been overridden.</p>
        <p>Bobby Singh, an assistant manager, said nothing like this had ever happened at the supermarket. ''It's a sad thing,'' said Mr. Singh, adding that he did not know Mr. Juarez-Cruz personally because their shifts did not overlap. He declined to comment further on the accident, and calls to managers at the supermarket were not returned.</p>
        <p>Patrick Purcell, the director of organizing for Local 1500, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said Mr. Juarez-Cruz's accident was indicative of the working conditions endured by employees of many nonunion supermarkets on the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Mr. Purcell said his union has been trying to organize these workers, many of whom are Mexican, for the last three months.</p>
        <p>''These machines are something that you should be working with supervision after being properly trained,'' Mr. Purcell said. He said that in stores where the union represents workers, there are clear signs and directions on the compactors.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Nikas said that Mr. Juarez-Cruz's father, Victor, was working at the supermarket when his son was killed. Relatives of Mr. Juarez-Cruz, who were gathered yesterday afternoon at his fifth-floor walk-up apartment at 528 West 159th Street, said he came to the United States from Tlaxcala, Mexico, eight months ago. The supermarket job, which typically ran from 8 p.m. until 7 a.m., enabled Mr. Juarez-Cruz to provide for his wife and 1-year-old daughter in Mexico, where his mother also lives, relatives said.</p>
        <p>While the police said Mr. Juarez-Cruz was 16 years old, his relatives said he was 20.</p>
        <p>A neighbor, Clara Echevarria, said Mr. Juarez-Cruz, his father and several other young men moved into the building about three months ago.</p>
