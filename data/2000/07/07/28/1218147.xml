        <p>CHANG AND ENG  By Darin Strauss  323 pages. Dutton. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Certainly there was more than enough outward drama in the lives of the ''Siamese twins'' Chang and Eng. The brothers were brought to America as boys in the 1820's, exhibited as freaks and subjected to the taunts and leers of strangers. They married, set up housekeeping in pre-Civil War North Carolina and had 21 children between them.</p>
        <p>Though Darin Strauss's first novel does a nimble job of chronicling these events, the real accomplishment of the book lies in its sensitive portrayal of the brothers and their conflicted relationship with each other. Like the recent Broadway musical ''Side Show'' (which was based on the lives of the conjoined sisters Violet and Daisy Hilton), this novel uses the twins' story as a springboard to examine such matters as identity, selfhood and fate. At the same time, in fictionalizing their story, it draws a nuanced and often affecting portrait of the brothers -- two very different personalities, bound together as doppelgangers for their entire lives.</p>
        <p>''Chang and Eng'' is narrated by Eng, the brother on the right. Eng is the more introspective, melancholy brother. He spends most of his free time reading the Bible and Shakespeare, and thinking, longingly, of his family in Siam. Since childhood he has yearned for separation: he not only wants to be like other people but craves freedom and privacy as well. He is frequently annoyed with his brother, Chang, whom he depicts as being slower, less observant and a hopeless drunk.</p>
        <p>Chang, on his part, is portrayed by newspaper writers as ''the More Dominant and Charming of the Two.'' He is outgoing, witty -- a natural performer who actually enjoys the stage. Chang also happens to be accepting of his fate: he does not want to be separated; he does not want to contemplate life without his brother; he never wants to be alone.</p>
        <p>To create a narrative architecture, Mr. Strauss, a graduate of the New York University creative writing program in fiction, cuts back and forth between two time frames: one recounting Chang and Eng's life in North Carolina with their wives and children; the second recounting their journey from Siam to the United States. Though this schematic structure initially feels a little forced, Eng's reminiscences have a distinct cumulative power that creates a sense of immediacy as the novel moves along.</p>
        <p>The twins, we're told, were born to a Mekong River fisherman and his wife in 1811 and for six years or so lived a comparatively normal life. Shielded from the outside world by their parents, the boys did not know that they were ''unlike most of the five million other Siamese peasants.'' Their childhood abruptly ends when soldiers arrive to take the boys off to court; rumor has it that the country's autocratic king regards the twins as bad omens and wants them put to death. The mercurial king, however, is charmed by Chang and Eng and soon installs them as members of his court, where they are displayed as prized treasures -- an eerie prelude to what will happen to them after a scheming entrepreneur brings them to the States.</p>
        <p>Happily for the reader, Mr. Strauss does not dwell on the humiliations Chang and Eng are forced to undergo as performers; he gives us just enough glimpses of their experience to make us understand their plight as double outsiders -- foreigners mocked as both ''Chinamen'' and ''monsters.'' Instead, Mr. Strauss spends much of the book detailing the brothers' relationship with two small-town sisters named Adelaide and Sarah Yates, whom they will eventually marry.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Strauss tells it -- and here it's particularly difficult for the reader to know just how many liberties he is taking with a historical record, which he says was ''a confusion of legend, sideshow hyperbole and editorial invention'' even during the twins' lives -- the sisters were aging and somewhat homely spinsters when they met Chang and Eng. In the town of Wilkesboro, N.C., both were regarded as pariahs: years ago, it seems, Sarah had been discovered having sexual relations with a slave, and the memory of that scandal had soiled both sisters' reputations. As a result they were inclined to sympathize with Chang and Eng and to welcome their proposals of marriage.</p>
        <p>Although romance was at one time more than the twins dared to dream of, their marriages -- Chang to Adelaide, Eng to Sarah -- soon begin to founder. Worst of all for Eng is the realization that he is in love with his brother's wife. It is here, in depicting a romantic triangle among Adelaide and the two brothers, that Mr. Strauss stumbles badly: the scenes showing Eng trying to brush Adelaide's arm or furtively hold hands with her while his brother snoozes in a drunken stupor inadvertently tip over into farce.</p>
        <p>What redeems these awkward passages is the author's evident sympathy for his characters and his ability to convey the brothers' enduring love for each other, despite their often contentious efforts to create independent lives. With ''Chang and Eng,'' Mr. Strauss has made a spirited -- and promising -- debut.</p>
