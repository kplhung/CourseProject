        <p>Despite a policy prohibiting military involvement in partisan politics, members of Congress and guests at the Republican National Convention will have an exclusive viewing of some of the Pentagon's latest hardware, including an aircraft that the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, tried to kill when he was defense secretary.</p>
        <p>Seizing what a spokesman today called ''a convenient opportunity'' to display some of its latest equipment, the Pentagon asked the armed services to ship -- at taxpayer expense -- weapons and other equipment to the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for what amounts to a three-day military trade show, beginning Saturday.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, the only Republican in President Clinton's cabinet, approved the display after receiving a written request earlier this month from Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican from suburban Philadelphia and senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen did so, officials said, only after the Pentagon was assured that the hardware -- and more than 150 service members accompanying it -- would not be used for any political activities.</p>
        <p>To emphasize the point, the assistant secretary of defense for legislative affairs, John K. Veroneau, sent Mr. Weldon a letter outlining certain conditions: in short, no photo opportunities.</p>
        <p>Even so, the display will be a centerpiece of a series of events organized by Mr. Weldon for about 100 Republican colleagues and their families, who will be staying in old Navy billets at the shipyard during the convention at the First Union Center, less than a mile away. Included in the festivities, closed to the public, will be a ''block party'' fund-raiser by Mr. Weldon on Monday.</p>
        <p>''This whole thing is awkward,'' said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit group in Washington. ''All this sexy, multibillion-dollar hardware there to impress delegates is very smarmy and probably inappropriate. If there isn't a rule against this, it seems to me there ought to be.''</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's role has even raised hackles among some military officers, who complained that, at best, it blurs the definition of what constitutes political activity. ''To say this is not a partisan event is borderline absurd,'' one officer said.</p>
        <p>Others at the Pentagon complained that the cost would have to come out of their own budgets, at a time they face spot shortages of money for readiness.</p>
        <p>Despite those misgivings, some of the services now appear to regard the display as a chance to do a little lobbying of their own. ''There's not a lot of enthusiasm for this,'' another official said, ''but if they're ordered to do it, they want to look good.''</p>
        <p>Among the aircraft to be displayed is the V-22 Osprey, which has crashed three times in the past decade. It is a hybrid with rotors that swivel so it can take off like a helicopter but cruise like a turboprop commuter plane. The Osprey has been beset by controversy over cost and mission as well as safety, and Mr. Cheney waged a long and unsuccessful battle against it when he was in the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>In addition to the V-22, the Marines are sending an amphibious vehicle and equipment for its chemical- and biological-attack response teams. The Air Force plans to include an unmanned surveillance aircraft, the Predator, as well as missiles and bombs and story boards promoting its newest fighter, the F-22.</p>
        <p>The Army, not to be outdone, has mobilized a virtual armory of equipment, including an Apache attack helicopter, its own unmanned aircraft and its troubled theater missile defense system.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania National Guard is contributing an M1-A1 tank, an armored personnel carrier and two more helicopters.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Navy is sending only an aging Sea Sprite helicopter from a nearby reserve unit, two surveillance vehicles and a small riverine boat.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials said today that it was too soon to put a cost on moving all the equipment to Philadelphia, though the Air Force estimated that its share would be at least $100,000.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, spent much of a news conference today defending the display. Mr. Bacon said that the events at the shipyard were an opportunity to provide what amounted to a briefing to lawmakers -- without mentioning lobbyists and other influential Republicans who might happen by -- but maintained that the display was not itself partisan.</p>
        <p>''It is something that's contemporaneous with the Republican National Convention,'' he said. ''It's not adjacent -- it's not right on the grounds where the convention is being held. It's nearby, but not on the grounds.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon also noted that Representative Robert A. Brady, a Democrat whose district includes the shipyard, supported the request, though he did not sign Mr. Weldon's request to Secretary Cohen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weldon's spokesman, Pete Peterson, said the congressman saw the shipyard, which is in the process of being closed and turned over for private development, as a convenient and secure location for his colleagues during the convention. Mr. Weldon, he said, was also eager to promote the shipyard's activities.</p>
        <p>So is Richard A. Goldbach, the chairman and chief executive of Metro Machines, one of the largest military contractors at the shipyard. His company is erecting a tent to highlight its work, which includes ship rebuilding and demolition.</p>
        <p>''It's pure and simple a promotion,'' Mr. Goldbach said.</p>
        <p>So far, there has been no word from the Democrats, though Pentagon officials said they would certainly approve a similar request.</p>
