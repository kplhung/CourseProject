        <p>Before they even lined up for the 87th running of the Sanford Stakes, Linda Rice was spotting D. Wayne Lukas $1,941,000 and 13 years in experience.

        <p>Before they even lined up for the 87th running of the Sanford Stakes, Linda Rice was spotting D. Wayne Lukas $1,941,000 and 13 years in experience. The colt she trains, City Zip, was purchased for $9,000 last year as a yearling. His colt, Yonaguska, was picked up for $1.9 million seven months ago as a 2-year-old. Rice had a handful of important stakes races on her resume; he had 13 Triple Crown victories and 20 national champions on his.</p>
        <p>But it took only 1:103/5  of horse racing -- the time City Zip clocked to win his second stakes race -- for Rice to show that inexpensive does not mean slow and that inexperience is erased one heat at a time. But up until the final yards of the six-furlong sprint, Rice and City Zip were spotting Lukas and Yonaguska lengths, too.</p>
        <p>After City Zip dueled the long shot Dancing Missile in a blistering opening quarter mile in 21.03 seconds, Jose Santos put the brakes on Rice's colt in such a dramatic way that the 36-year-old trainer thought they were out of the race. ''I was nervous,'' Rice said. ''I thought we were in trouble, and it might cost us the race.''</p>
        <p>But Santos, who was aboard City Zip 24 days ago in his Tremont victory at Belmont, was confident that he knew his colt. ''Having the rail forced me to use him on the pace early,'' Santos said. ''Moving toward the far turn, I decided to give him a little break and took back.''</p>
        <p>The grinding down of gears allowed Yonaguska and Jerry Bailey to gun wide around the turn and take a two-length lead. It looked like enough for the undefeated son of Cherokee Run to grind down his bargain basement rival just as he had done to City Zip in the Flash Stakes last month.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I moved too soon,'' Bailey said. ''That middle move tired him out. He was flat in the last furlong.''</p>
        <p>Santos, however, had plenty of run remaining in his horse. He angled City Zip outside in the stretch and urged him with staccato left-handed whips past the 3-5 favorite to the throaty delight of the crowd of 15,668.</p>
        <p>When City Zip crossed the finish line a three-and-a-half-length winner, his owners, Carl Bowling and Chuck Thompson, had won $65,220 of the $108,700 purse, his backers had collected $8.40 on a $2 bet and Rice had executed a giant upset in the Grade II race.</p>
        <p>Why had City Zip barely attracted cash in the sales ring?</p>
        <p>''He has a lot of imperfections,'' Rice said. ''He's crooked. He's got a list of physically unappealing things that is as long as my arm. You can criticize his appearance, but you can't be critical of him as a race horse.''</p>
        <p>The trainer has also been underappreciated despite earning a reputation for coaxing top performances out of young horses. She learned how to break and train fledgling horses from her father and mother, Clyde and Jean Rice, who have operated well-regarded training centers, first in Pennsylvania and now in Ocala, Fla. In 1998, Rice  guided Things Change to victories in the juvenile filly centerpiece races here, the Adirondack and Spinaway.</p>
        <p>''I came into this business with the baby horses,'' she said. ''It was the background on our farm and that is how I learned the business.''</p>
        <p>She is very likely to face Yonaguska as well as third-place finisher Scorpion, another Lukas horse, in the Hopeful on Sept. 2. Lukas, the Hall of Fame trainer, took the loss in stride. ''I think we compromised our chances with the big middle move,'' he said. ''But hey, that is why we run them.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Val's Prince heads a field of 14 in the the Grade II $150,000 Bernard Baruch Handicap on Friday. The 8-year-old gelding won the 1997 Turf Classic at Belmont and became the first American winner of the Group II Hong Kong International Cup at Sha Tin that same year. He has earned $2 million in a career that once was threatened by a disabling case of colic and a fractured ankle. ''He's been training real well,'' the trainer JIMMY PICOU said. ''He's a survivor.''</p>
