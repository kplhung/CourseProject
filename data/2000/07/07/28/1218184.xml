        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read in ''A Hard Life for Amerasian Children'' (news article, July 23) about the human chain surrounding the base on Okinawa demanding that Americans leave, I was dismayed. But when I read about the difficulties Amerasian children endure because of their abandonment by American servicemen, my dismay turned to indignation.</p>
        <p>These children are derided and made unwelcome in Japanese schools. Were it not for the newly established Amerasian school, there would be no hope. And were it not for efforts to find some of the ''deadbeat'' dads, these families would have no means of support.</p>

        <p>We have a military understanding with the Japanese to allow 22,000 soldiers to be stationed on Okinawa, but we have no understanding relating to abandoned women and children. This reveals our arrogance and disdain for powerless Okinawans.</p>
