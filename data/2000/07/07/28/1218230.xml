        <p>Leaving behind the tranquillity of the Georgia mountains to come to the Capitol, Zell Miller, a Democrat and former Georgia governor, came out of retirement today to be sworn in as United States senator.</p>
        <p>After taking the oath of office, Senator Miller spoke on the Senate floor of the man whose seat he is filling, Paul Coverdell, the 61-year-old Republican who died of a brain hemorrhage on July 18.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, one of the state's most popular politicians, was offered the job by the governor of Georgia, Roy Barnes. Mr. Miller, 68, will run in a special election on Nov. 7 to fill the remainder of Mr. Coverdell's term, which ends in 2005, a decision that has buoyed Democratic hopes for reclaiming control of the Senate.</p>
        <p>A two-term governor who retired last year, Mr. Miller arrives in the Senate amid partisan discord; this week Democrats virtually shut down the Senate, objecting to the way Republicans are handling federal judicial nominations.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Miller, a centrist, made it clear that he hoped to honor Mr. Coverdell by trying to leap beyond the restraints of party.</p>
        <p>''In addition to what he accomplished, Paul will always be remembered for how he accomplished it,'' Mr. Miller said. ''He was as committed a Republican as I am a dedicated Democrat. And yet, he was always looking for ways to get things done across party lines.''</p>
        <p>''Let me repeat the pledge I made to my governor and to the people of Georgia when I accepted this mission,'' Mr. Miller added. ''I will serve no single political party, but rather 7.5 million Georgians.''</p>
        <p>Democrats said a victory by Mr. Miller in November might tilt the balance of power in their favor. Republicans now hold 54 seats to the Democrats' 46.</p>
        <p>When he left office in 1999, Mr. Miller had an approval rating in the state of 80 percent, and Democrats said he was one of the few candidates who could, on short notice, assemble a campaign and raise the money needed to get elected.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in a while, there is a real feeling we can capture the Senate,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said.</p>
        <p>No Republican challenger has stepped forward, but a potential candidate emerged today: Lewis Jordan, the former chief executive of ValuJet Airlines. Aides said Republican leaders were pleased with the prospect because Mr. Jordan is rich enough to help finance his campaign.</p>
        <p>Representative Bob Barr is also considering a run for the seat, but the rest of the state's Republican Congressional delegation has withdrawn from consideration.</p>
        <p>The Nov. 7 election is a quirky one; it is officially nonpartisan and the winning candidate requires a 50 percent majority to avoid a runoff.</p>
        <p>Most analysts say a change in power in the Senate is unlikely, but they do not rule it out. Democrats have fewer vulnerable incumbents than Republicans and are well-positioned in several races for open seats.</p>
        <p>Republicans acknowledged Mr. Miller's popularity in his home state and said Democrats had chosen wisely.</p>
        <p>''They shrewdly picked the one person in Georgia that gives them any chance of taking the seat back from Republicans,'' said Chuck Clay, the state Republican chairman.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Clay added, the Senate was not the statehouse, no matter how many times today Democrats evoked Mr. Coverdell's name and the spirit of cooperation.</p>
        <p>''You cannot say you are going to vote on and implement the Paul Coverdell view of things and be a Democrat,'' he said. ''You can't do that in Washington. You are on one team or on the other team.''</p>
        <p>As governor, Mr. Miller's showcase accomplishment was establishing a state lottery and using the money to create a college scholarship fund for Georgia students.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, lauded the former governor's ability to transcend partisanship. ''In deciding public policy,'' Mr. Daschle recounted, ''he has said, 'The most important question is not: How will this affect my chances in the next election? The proper question is: What will this mean for my grandchildren?' ''</p>
