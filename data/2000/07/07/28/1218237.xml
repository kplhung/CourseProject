        <p>Concerned that the federal government may soon recognize two more Indian tribes in Connecticut, two state officials said today that they planned to convene dozens of state and city officials in September to discuss the legitimacy of the tribes' land claims and the validity of the recognition process.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement, made in a news conference by State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the State Senate's majority leader, George C.

        <p>Concerned that the federal government may soon recognize two more Indian tribes in Connecticut, two state officials said today that they planned to convene dozens of state and city officials in September to discuss the legitimacy of the tribes' land claims and the validity of the recognition process.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement, made in a news conference by State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the State Senate's majority leader, George C. Jepsen, is the latest in a weeks-long series of moves by elected officials troubled by recent indications from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs that it is poised to confer recognition on the two tribes within a matter of months.</p>
        <p>Calling the prospect of that recognition a ''time bomb,'' Mr. Jepsen said, ''There's a need in this state to bring elected and community officials together so that we can all get up to speed together on this enormously complex process and all the facts that go along with it.''</p>
        <p>The officials' concern stems from the assumption that once recognized, the two Indian tribes under consideration -- the Eastern Pequots and the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots -- will do what the Mohegan and Mashantucket Pequot tribes have already done: use their autonomy to build monumental casinos in hopes of making millions of dollars a year in  gambling revenue. Many residents  fear losing property to land claims, as well as traffic congestion and the social costs of legalized gambling.</p>
        <p>On March 31, Kevin Gover, the top official in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a unit of the Interior Department, issued a preliminary finding that the two tribes deserved official recognition. The finding is the penultimate step in a years-long federal process that Mr. Blumenthal and members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation have repeatedly criticized as favoring the tribes.</p>
        <p>Those criticisms center on their belief that Mr. Gover, the Interior Department's assistant secretary in charge of approving recognition claims submitted to the B.I.A., is predisposed to grant recognition to tribes even if they have not completed the seven-step approval process.</p>
        <p>After today's news conference, Mr. Blumenthal sent a letter to John Leshy, the Interior Department's solicitor, asking him to recuse Mr. Gover, who is a Pawnee Indian from Oklahoma, from the recognition process for the two Connecticut tribes. The letter included a quotation attributed to Mr. Gover in The Day, a New London newspaper, in May. ''I would rather recognize someone who should not be recognized than fail someone who should,'' Mr. Gover was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>Early last month, Mr. Blumenthal wrote a letter to the Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, urging him to freeze all tribal recognition requests until the department developed a way to ensure they would be evaluated fairly and honestly.</p>
        <p>''The Bureau of Indian Affairs is changing its criteria, altering the rules of the game in the middle of the tribal recognition process,'' Mr. Blumenthal said today. ''It is unfair, it's susceptible excessively to the interests of politics and money.''</p>
        <p>Nedra Darling, a spokeswoman for the B.I.A., said the bureau's process was fair and rigorous. ''We're following a code,'' she said. ''It's a lot of roll-up-your-sleeves research and analytical work.''</p>
        <p>Two other tribes in Connecticut, the Golden Hill Paugussetts and the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation, which have been recognized by the state for more than a century, have pending petitions for federal recognition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Jepsen said they would hold a summit, which they said would include state and local officials and business and tribal leaders, on Sept. 14 in a location to be named near Bridgeport.  They said they would invite Indian leaders as well as officials from the B.I.A., though when contacted today, only the Schaghticoke chief, Richard Velky, said he planned to attend.</p>
        <p>''Their process is broken down,'' he said of the federal bureau. ''You've got too many groups out there calling themselves a nation or a tribe.''</p>
        <p>Michael D. O'Connell, a lawyer for the Golden Hill Paugussetts, whose 100 members live on two reservations, in Bridgeport and near Colchester, Conn., said he was wary of attending the meeting. ''My fear is that it's just intended to be another opportunity to bash the various Indian tribes,'' he said. ''We'll wait to see if we're invited.''</p>
