        <p>Dick Cheney tried today to beat back questions about his conservative voting record, appearing on the morning news programs of all three major networks as the Bush campaign fought to keep from being defined by the second man on the ticket.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush jumped into the debate, accusing the Democrats of using a ''constant line -- vote for me, I'm going to tear down the other person'' -- in attacking the record of his running mate, whose service as defense secretary to Mr. Bush's father followed 10 years in the House.</p>
        <p>''Secretary Cheney brought people together and helped win a war,'' Mr. Bush said, ''which stands in stark contrast to Vice President Al Gore, who tends to divide people to create war.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush spoke as Mr. Cheney, for a second straight day, was called on to explain positions he took as a congressman from Wyoming, including votes against the equal rights amendment, gun control and sanctions on South Africa's apartheid government.</p>
        <p>Democrats have highlighted those stands to undercut Mr. Bush's efforts to define himself as a ''different kind of Republican.''</p>
        <p>At times today, Mr. Cheney shot back by pointing to inconsistencies in Mr. Gore's own Congressional voting record. At other times, he defended his conservative views. And occasionally, he turned to talk of legislative process.</p>
        <p>Asked, for instance, why he had voted against the equal rights amendment, he said Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., as the speaker of a Democratic-controlled House, had brought it up for a vote under a procedure ''that prohibited amendments of any kind -- we had to accept or reject it.'' He said he had feared that the way it was written would have required the drafting of women into the military.</p>
        <p>''Now, I didn't think that was a very good idea,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''The Early Show'' on CBS.</p>
        <p>Several hours later Mr. Bush made a brief appearance before reporters, taking time out from practicing his acceptance speech for his nomination next week, and maintained that he had not been blindsided by Mr. Cheney's record.</p>
        <p>''Of course I knew his votes,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I also know his record. What do you expect? I'm running against people who all they do is spend time tearing people down.''</p>
        <p>The Democrats kept up their efforts to use Mr. Cheney's record as a way of tying Mr. Bush to a Republican establishment of the past.</p>
        <p>''What Cheney's selection has done is given us a rather vivid picture of old guard Republicanism,'' said Mark Fabiani, a deputy Gore campaign manager. And, Mr. Fabiani said, ''some of his past votes are hard to explain away in any era.''</p>
        <p>The difficulty for Mr. Bush is that some of the stands of his running mate cut right to the heart of the way he has been seeking to define himself as a ''compassionate conservative.'' Mr. Bush has put a heavy premium on education, for example, and Mr. Cheney voted against the Head Start program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush regularly surrounds himself with members of minorities and recently spoke at the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Cheney voted against imposing economic sanctions on the apartheid government of South Africa and against a House resolution calling for Nelson Mandela to be freed after 23 years in prison.</p>
        <p>This morning Mr. Cheney said on the NBC News television program ''Today'' that ''this notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical distortion by Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>He said the issue had been tied up in a debate over sanctions against South Africa. He said he believed that forcing United States companies out of South Africa would have left many blacks there worse off, because ''any good jobs available to black South Africans were with American firms.''</p>
        <p>Of domestic matters, Mr. Cheney argued that the 1980's, when he served in the House, were a different era, when budget deficits required votes to control spending. And he said his rise in Congress up the leadership ladder of his party showed that he had not been viewed as an extreme conservative.</p>
        <p>''So whatever the Democrats want to say about me now,'' he said, ''the fact of the matter was many Democrats, as well as all of the Republicans, thought I was a reasonably respectable fellow in the 1980's.''</p>
        <p>On some issues, Mr. Cheney stood firm. When asked why he had been one of only 21 House members to vote against a ban on so-called cop-killer bullets, he said: ''I consistently voted against gun control. I'm one of those people who believes that the solution to our gun problem is to enforce existing laws, not impose new restrictions on law-abiding citizens.''</p>
        <p>Pressed as to why in 1988 he voted against a ban on plastic guns that can make it through airport security, a measure that was not opposed by even the National Rifle Association, he said, ''Well, obviously I wasn't in the pocket of the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>And on ABC's ''Good Morning America,'' he tried to turn the scrutiny to Mr. Gore, whose position on gun issues has changed since his first years in Congress. ''At the same time that I was doing that, casting those votes, Al Gore was receiving an A rating from the National Rifle Association,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''He was pro-gun and anti-gun-control.''</p>
        <p>As for his votes against creating the Department of Education and against spending on Head Start, Mr. Cheney cautioned against the assumption ''that anything that's got the word 'education' on it is good.''</p>
        <p>''You've got to look at the substance of it,'' he said. ''You've got to analyze the legislation. The fact of the matter is that education is primarily a state and local responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney also answered questions about a Republican fund-raising brochure from 1992 that had a picture of him as defense secretary and promised large contributors the right to attend unspecified government briefings.</p>
        <p>''We didn't do any fund-raisers in the Pentagon,'' he said, ''never did. I did brief people from time to time, but as a general rule we stayed out of partisan politics in the Pentagon.''</p>
