        <p>Valdirlei Dias Nunes  Ramis Barquet  41 East 57th Street  Manhattan  Through Sept. 2</p>
        <p>Betsabee Romero is into cars. An interesting but somewhat unfocused appropriator born in Mexico in 1963, she mixes folk, Pop and modernist elements. In her first New York solo show, she presents religious narratives painted on automobile hoods and a wall-scale composition of emblematic canvases arranged in a grid matching that of downtown Mexico City with little toy cars running in the lanes between pictures.</p>
        <p>Ms. Romero's most persuasive works, however, are sculptural. One is a funky, reconstructed vintage Volkswagen with parts of its body replaced by straw, corrugated plastic roofing or wood paneling. Thus the ''Beetle,'' one of Mexico's most popular cars, is transformed from a piece of modern machinery to a work of folk assemblage. ''Underground,'' a part-Minimalist, part-Surrealist installation, has the shape of a car roof pushing up under a gallery floor completely covered in wood veneer. This deadpan Magritte-style work looks as if it might be headed in a good direction.</p>
        <p>In this gallery's small viewing room, Valdirlei Dias Nunes, a Brazilian painter, is also having a first New York show. Mr. Nunes is not a bit unfocused in his exploration of illusionism and geometric abstraction. Each of his white, breadbox-size canvases bears a variation of a boxy, imaginary Minimalist structure rising up from the picture's lower edge. Painted with deft trompe l'oeil realism, permutations of wood-grained slabs and slender sticks generate a modest yet complex, and oddly mysterious, playfulness.</p>
