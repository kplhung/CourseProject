        <p>I wouldn't know a Gibson from a Stratocaster. My favorite guitarists are Django Reinhardt, Eddie Lang and Andres Segovia, and none of them, as far as I know, ever played a single note at the Grand Ole Opry.</p>
        <p>That could cast a rather long shadow, I suppose, over my qualifications as a guide to Music City, U.S.A., except that there is a lot more than picking and fiddling, a lot more than ballads of love and loss, in Nashville's past, present and future -- especially its future. Which is no bad thing for the city, since country music, which rang up sales of tapes and records of almost $2 billion two years ago, is suffering through a bit of a slump at the moment.</p>
        <p>The Convention and Visitors Bureau here has set aside $4 million to play down the city's hillbilly image and emphasize its developing cosmopolitanism. It should not prove too hard a sell; like Charlotte, N.C.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and a number of other second-tier Southern cities, this one is rapidly acquiring big-time accouterments, including a National Football League team called the Titans. With a brand-new $292 million stadium, a bruiser of a running back named Eddie George and a fearsome, long-limbed defensive end named Jevon (the Freak) Kearse, the Titans went to the Super Bowl last year and made the city swagger a little.</p>
        <p>Already in business or on the way are a zoo, a new Country Music Hall of Fame, an enormous shopping complex on the scale of the Mall of America near Minneapolis, a new library designed by Robert A. M. Stern, an  arena to house the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League and the ambitious new Frist Center for the Visual Arts, about which a few more words later.</p>
        <p>What interests me most about Nashville, however, is its past, notably its often neglected role as an agent of political and intellectual change.</p>
        <p>It was from Nashville -- or rather from the Hermitage, his home just east of town -- that rugged old Andrew Jackson set off for Washington in 1829, having ousted the aristocratic John Quincy Adams in the pivotal election of 1828. A frontiersman, a general, the first president from west of the Alleghenies, the first self-made man to take up residence in the White House, Jackson shaped modern American democracy in the image of his own egalitarianism. He fostered government by the unwashed masses instead of the propertied classes.</p>
        <p>The muddy boots of Jackson's followers spoiled the carpets at the post-inaugural party and his opponents derided him as ''some kind of border savage,'' in the words of Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. But he proved them wrong, taking a new, more aggressive style of leadership to Washington and blazing a path for a fresh tramontane dynasty that included James K. Polk and Abraham Lincoln, a Kentuckian before he moved to Illinois.</p>
        <p>A century later, in the early 1920's, a group of writers at Vanderbilt University, just west of downtown Nashville, coalesced around a journal they called The Fugitive. They railed against both the industrialization of the South and what they called the ''moonlight and magnolia'' distortion of traditional agrarian values.</p>
        <p>Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom, two of the most important modern American critics, were members of the group, but its star was Robert Penn Warren. His biographer, Joseph Blotner, called him this country's greatest 20th-century man of letters, which seems reasonable enough given his achievements as a poet, critic, novelist, playwright, essayist and biographer. Warren wrote what for me is the greatest of political novels, ''All the King's Men,'' whose protagonist, Willie Stark, was a ringer for Huey P. Long, and he was the only person to win Pulitzer Prizes for both poetry and fiction.</p>
        <p>After a few years, the Fugitives became the Agrarians, and most members drifted away from Vanderbilt, but not before they had helped to  ignite the Southern Literary Renaissance. Eventually, those fevered nights in Nashville helped to mold publications like The Kenyon Review and The Sewanee Review and writers like Randall Jarrell, James Dickey and Cleanth Brooks.</p>
        <p>Academic Achievements</p>
        <p>Vanderbilt may well be entering a bright new era. Founded in 1872 and endowed by Cornelius Vanderbilt, it has evolved from Methodist and regional origins into an institution of national repute with 10,000 students. Already among the 20 wealthiest colleges and universities in the nation, it has found a new champion in Martha R. Ingram, whose family controls Nashville-based Ingram Industries, one of the nation's dozen largest privately held companies. Among many other things, Ingram is the largest book wholesaler in the country.</p>
        <p>In 1998 Mrs. Ingram gave Vanderbilt $300 million in Ingram stock -- the second-largest donation ever made to any American university -- and this year she played a leading role in persuading E. Gordon Gee to come here as chancellor. A former president of Ohio State University, Mr. Gee staggered the educational world by leaving Brown University, where he had only recently been installed as president.</p>
        <p>Many in the region say Mrs. Ingram, who was also the prime mover in establishing the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, has ambitions to make Vanderbilt into a southern Stanford or Harvard, or at least to put it on an academic par with Duke and the University of Virginia. Not so, she said.</p>
        <p>''Culturally, we were a little deprived, but we've begun to remedy that,'' Mrs. Ingram told me. ''Education has always been taken seriously here. Now it's time to try to take Vanderbilt up a notch or two, but we don't want it to be a Southern equivalent of something else. Not at all. We want to be the best we can be on our own terms.''</p>
        <p>The city's early settlers hiked through the Cumberland Gap, a natural opening in the Appalachian barrier near the point where Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky meet. They settled along the Cumberland River, which cuts through lovely limestone hills in this region, and quickly established Nashborough, as it was first called, as a staging point to the west. From here, the Natchez Trace, a crude forest track, linked the interior South to the Mississippi.</p>
        <p>For many generations, Nashville's banks and insurance companies formed the basis of its prosperity. They gave Union Street a modest reputation as ''the Wall Street of the South,'' but in recent years they have been sold to out-of-town interests, along with The Tennessean, long the city's dominant newspaper, and a number of the more important radio and television stations.</p>
        <p>Great hunks of Music Row now belong to big foreign conglomerates like Bertelsmann of Germany and Sony of Japan.</p>
        <p>''Nashville used to be a home-owned, home-operated kind of city,'' said John Egerton, a social historian who has lived here for 35 years. ''But for a long time, it has had an aspiration to celebrity, and by this point it is quite clearly a city on the make. It's a money culture. But that's the New South, I guess. The new world.''</p>
        <p>As the state capital, Nashville remains a cockpit of political drama. Closely divided between the two parties, Tennessee has produced prominent Democrats like Cordell Hull, Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of state; Estes Kefauver, the 1956 vice presidential nominee; and Albert Gore Sr. It has produced powerful Republicans like Howard H. Baker Jr. and Lamar Alexander. They play the game for keeps here, and they don't forget; in casual conversation six years after he lost his seat, former Senator Jim Sasser bitterly condemned the Republican politicians who had denied him a fourth term as ''reactionary know-nothings.''</p>
        <p>At the moment, politics sometimes looks like Nashville's growth industry. Mr. Gore, soon to be the Democratic nominee for President, is a native son, sort of; born in Washington, he spent summers in Carthage, Tenn., one of many nearby towns  with names drawn from antiquity, then graduated from Harvard and studied for a year at Vanderbilt's divinity school. He moved his headquarters here when his primary campaign was floundering, and Yankee staff members have learned more than they wanted to know about biscuits with cream gravy.</p>
        <p>Senator Fred Thompson, a Republican, was promoted for a time this year as a candidate for vice president, and there were even a few mentions of Tennessee's other senator, William H. Frist.</p>
        <p>Importance of Health Care</p>
        <p>In fact, though, Middle Tennessee, the region anchored by this city, has found more reliable ways to make a living. The most important is health care. Nashville has a string of important hospitals, and it is the headquarters of HCA, the largest hospital management company in the country. HCA was founded by Senator Frist's father, and after many corporate tribulations, Thomas F. Frist Jr., the senator's brother, returned as chief executive to turn it around.</p>
        <p>The city's economy benefits as well from a Nissan auto plant at Smyrna and the Saturn factory at Spring Hill, both south of here. Bridgestone/Firestone produces tires here, too. And Dell has just begun shipping computers from a vast new Nashville factory.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1980's, this has been one of the boom towns of the South, growing more rapidly than any other metropolitan area between Atlanta and Dallas-Fort Worth. Employment is so full that stores and airlines have trouble filling jobs. Metropolitan Nashville's population now exceeds a million, and it has recently overtaken Memphis as the largest urban area in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>The swells of Nashville live in Belle Meade, a suburb of enormous houses beneath lofty shade trees on even more enormous lawns. They don't mix much with the denim-clad country crowd, and this is more and more their city.</p>
        <p>But the two groups have a few things in common. The whole town assuages its sweet tooth with a locally produced candy called Goo-Goo Clusters, a highly caloric confection of peanuts, chocolate, caramel and marshmallow. Ronald Reagan took jelly beans to the White House; if Al Gore wins the presidency this year, look for him to stock the Oval Office with Goo-Goo Clusters.</p>
        <p>Rhinestone Cowboys</p>
        <p>As for country music, my wife, Betsey, and I are learning.</p>
        <p>We were prepared for the army of musicians and would-be musicians looking for a break, waiting on tables and strumming their guitars everywhere -- in rundown bars, on street corners, in legendary dives like Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and Robert's Western World. We were ready for the rhinestones, too.</p>
        <p>Robert Altman saw to that in ''Nashville,'' his brilliant, Chaucerian film about the princes and princesses of country music, with egos the size of cathedrals, as well as the no-hopers. Now the French photographer Michel Arnaud has brought the picture up to date in a handsome new book, ''Nashville: Pilgrims of Guitar Town,'' soon to be published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang.</p>
        <p>But this is one of those places that you have to see to believe.</p>
        <p>You could do a lot worse than start  at the Country Music Hall of Fame, which reminded even a country-music philistine like me how much good stuff has flowed from Nashville into the American pop-culture mainstream. A fan of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw et al., I was intrigued to learn more about Bob Wills, who made ''San Antonio Rose'' popular and more or less invented the wonderfully rhythmic music called Western Swing. Apparently he never performed without a five-cent cigar in his mouth. I had not known that Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs played that captivating banjo tune (it's called ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown'') on the soundtrack of ''Bonnie and Clyde.''</p>
        <p>And I ask you, for sheer gaudy glory, what could match the hall's prize possession, Elvis Presley's ''solid gold'' Cadillac, a perfect totem of American excess?</p>
        <p>Longtime Nashville residents remember the days when Music Row consisted of ratty houses used as music publishers' headquarters. The Opry played in the pre-renovation Ryman Auditorium, whose roof sometimes leaked.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't any air-conditioning,'' recalled Tricia Frist, Thomas Frist's wife, ''so you stuck to the back of the seats.''</p>
        <p>Now Music Row is lined with multistory office buildings, and the Opry has moved to a riverside site on the edge of town. Today's Grand Ole Opry House has air-conditioning, a light board and sound system that would do credit to Las Vegas and more seats than the Metropolitan Opera House: 4,400, versus 3,800. Nearby stand the kitschy Opryland Hotel and a sprawling mall called Opry Mills. An expanded Country Music Hall of Fame is to open closer to downtown in May.</p>
        <p>Musical Moments</p>
        <p>Its fans treat the Opry with tremendous seriousness, according it a place in their hearts alongside stock-car racing and evangelical Christianity. (One car in the immense parking lot bore the license plate ''SAVED 67.'') An Opry performance feels a little like a secular church service. The audience is, in fact, seated in pews, not individual seats. Everyone listened raptly and respectfully the Saturday night we were there, munching their popcorn and slurping Big Drinks, with none of the hubbub of a rock concert.</p>
        <p>Viewed from another perspective, this is vaudeville for hayseeds, with a carefully calibrated blend of corny jokes, spangly costumes, bottle blondes and a surprising range of music -- not just country and bluegrass, but also honky-tonk, western, rockabilly, gospel and quasi-Cajun. A lot of the lyrics may be banal and the emotional range may be severely limited, but there are big voices up there onstage, and the songs are sung with unmistakable skill.</p>
        <p>''You'd need a heart of steel not to like this stuff,'' said Betsey, charmed by Porter Wagoner, the gold-booted  M.C. who joined the company 43 years ago and helped to advance the career of a buxom thrush named Dolly Parton.</p>
        <p>But we realized what aliens we were in this culture when the crowd lustily cheered an explicitly sexist, rabidly homophobic, stunningly anti-government ditty called ''We Want America Back.'' The Supreme Court, one of the song's milder verses suggested, hands out free condoms while frowning on the distribution of Gideon Bibles. Rush Limbaugh would have been enthralled.</p>
        <p>There are other art forms in Nashville, but sometimes you have to look around a bit to find them.</p>
        <p>You might despair about the city's contemporary architecture if all you saw was its skyline, dominated by the Bell South building. From one angle, I thought, it looked like some misbegotten postmodern Mont St.-Michel; from another, a mooring mast for dirigibles. As usual, the word on the street was more apt; Nashville folk call it the Batcave or the Batman Building.</p>
        <p>My friend Joseph B. Ledbetter, a Nashville businessman of broad interests, set me right. The concrete span bridge on the Natchez Trace Parkway south of town, he said, ''is perhaps the most beautiful sight in all of Nashville.'' So it is: a broad, lean, handsome arch across a verdant valley, an architectural engineering gem as graceful as the soaring Sunshine Skyway in Florida.</p>
        <p>'Good to the Last Drop'</p>
        <p>The same goes for pictures. Nashville's showplace is Cheekwood, the limestone mansion built in the 1930's by Leslie Cheek, who made a pile from Maxwell House Coffee (named after the Nashville hotel where Theodore Roosevelt supposedly proclaimed it ''Good to the Last Drop''). While we greatly admired the English silver, some of it by Hester Bateman and Matthew Boulton, we found the paintings disappointing and the gardens, with the exception of the extensive boxwood hedges, beaten down by Nashville's unforgiving midsummer heat.</p>
        <p>But at Fisk University, in a far less leafy part of town, we found an utterly unheralded trove of early American modernism. Founded by missionaries and freedmen in 1866, only a year after Appomattox, Fisk may be the oldest historically black institution of higher education in the country. A statue of W. E. B. DuBois, the school's most famous alumnus, stands on the campus. After the death of the pioneering photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1946, his widow, Georgia O'Keeffe, divided his art collection five ways, giving most of the paintings to big urban museums but sending 101 others to Fisk, where they hang today in a modest little red-brick building.</p>
        <p>A few are by European masters, including Severini and Renoir and Signac. There is an arrestingly caustic portrait of a dandy in pince-nez and his companion, swathed in pearls and furs, done by the German George Grosz while he was living in New York during World War II. Three or four less well-known artists are included here, among them Abraham Walkowitz, whose vaguely Cezanne-like work was represented in the famous Armory Show in Manhattan in 1913.</p>
        <p>The treasures of the Fisk collection, to my mind, are the large groups of works by Marsden Hartley, Arthur G. Dove, Charles Demuth (especially a precise, curiously touching little watercolor of an eggplant and some bell peppers) and John Marin. There are more than a dozen Marins, watercolors and dry-point etchings, ranging from Venice to Manhattan to the Maine coast.</p>
        <p>These same artists are shown to no better advantage in Washington's Phillips Collection, which owes part of its renown to them. It is a pity that no corporation or government body has stepped forward to underwrite improvements to the galleries at Fisk or to help publish a catalog.  Chronically short of cash for decades, the university desperately needs every cent of help.</p>
        <p>Exhibiting Art</p>
        <p>Perhaps one day the Stieglitz collection will be shown at the $45 million Frist Center, now being carved out of the old Nashville Post Office, a good-looking New Deal building guarded by stone eagles outside and decorated with elegant Art Deco aluminum screens inside. When it opens next year, it will give Nashville 24,000 square feet of gallery space to house major traveling exhibitions as well as temporary exhibitions of locally owned art.</p>
        <p>For now at least, the center will have no collection of its own.</p>
        <p>''We're rather late to the party,'' said Chase W. Rynd, the center's executive director, who came here from Tacoma, Wash. ''Good art is very expensive these days, so we are concentrating our resources on the building, on education and on holding the prices down. Kids 18 and under will pay nothing.''</p>
        <p>The center is scheduled to open on April 8, with a show from the Art Gallery of Ontario. Nashville will hit another cultural milestone this fall when the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, for the first time in its history, plays in Carnegie Hall on Sept. 25. More than 1,000 local residents have booked trips to New York to cheer their musicians in a program featuring the violin virtuoso Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg.</p>
        <p>It will be a triumphal moment for Kenneth Schermerhorn, the orchestra's music director since 1983. Earlier in a long career, he conducted both the Milwaukee Symphony and the orchestra of the American Ballet Theater in New York.</p>
        <p>With Classical Music</p>
        <p>Classical music seems somehow appropriate for a city that has so much classical architecture, notably timeless houses like Belle Meade Plantation. This is the kind of Southern mansion, in the words of the critic Roger G. Kennedy, that seems to be ''sleeping away the centuries, its white columns composing a kind of cage to keep what lies within from being touched by time.''</p>
        <p>The Hermitage is another such house, set next to a garden ablaze with hollyhocks and crape myrtle in high summer. Its most impressive exterior feature is its portico, with six two-story columns painted, then sprayed with sand to simulate stone. They are topped with what were apparently meant to be acanthus leaves, but no botanist would recognize them as such. Inside, the furniture, though largely original, is outshone by the textiles and wallpapers, especially the exceptional scenes of  Telemachus and Calypso, made in Paris in 1837, which hang in the foyer.</p>
        <p>Then there is the work of William Strickland, who came to Nashville from Philadelphia after designing the magnificent Second Bank of the United States. Here, he produced the Downtown Presbyterian Church (1851), perhaps the finest Egyptian Revival building in the nation, a real Thebes on the Cumberland, and the State Capitol (1859), finished by his son. He is buried there.</p>
        <p>And finally, the Parthenon -- Nashville's Parthenon, the only full-size replica in the world, first built of wood and plaster in 1897, and then, 25 years later, when it had started to melt like ice cream in the sun, replaced with a copy in brownish concrete. Like the original, it is sometimes partially covered with scaffolding, but the little museum inside is open, occupied by a Winslow Homer exhibition.</p>
        <p>What are we to think about this apparition, which John Seigenthaler, the publisher emeritus of The Tennessean, calls ''a phenomenal monstrosity?'' Betsey said this: ''The Elgin marbles seem to be in place, so what's the fuss about?''</p>
        <p>Beyond Red-Eye Gravy, Gizzards and That Country Sound</p>
        <p>Nashville is 750 to 800 miles miles southwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions as well as travel information follows.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>HERMITAGE SUITE HOTEL, 231 Sixth Avenue North, (615) 244-3121. Minnesota Fats, the legendary pool hustler, passed his last days here, and Dinah Shore began her career here with Francis Craig's orchestra. But the magnificent, richly marbled lobby reeked of disinfectant when we checked in, and the dated though spacious guest rooms had dirty windows. Keener management and a less lackadaisical staff could work wonders at this Beaux-Arts landmark. Double room rates: $99 to $209.</p>
        <p>LOEWS VANDERBILT, 2100 West End Avenue, (615) 320-1700. Without doubt the best address in a city with a chronic dearth of first-class hotels. A sparkling travertine lobby, a plugged-in young staff (including car parkers working their way through the university just across the street) and a convenient location more than compensate for the somewhat anonymous, run-of-the-mill rooms. A Ruth's Chris Steak House on the site caters to itinerant carnivores. Double room rates: midweek, $149 to $269; weekend, $109 to $269.</p>
        <p>OPRYLAND HOTEL, 2800 Opryland Drive, (615) 889-1000. This is the capitol of the Kingdom of Schlock, a maze of 2,883 guest rooms, 15 restaurants, 27 shops, 600,000 square feet of meeting and exhibition space, three pools and nine acres of interior gardens, hard by the Grand Ole Opry and its adjacent outlet mall. ''Shoppertainment,'' they call it. Take your hiking boots; Yogi Berra said he crossed three time zones between the front desk and his room. Double room rates: room with balcony and terrace that overlooks the extensive gardens, $245; traditional room with view of the hotel exterior, $195.</p>
        <p>RENAISSANCE NASHVILLE, 611 Commerce Street, (615) 255-8400. Linked to the city's convention center and arena by covered passageways, this is Nashville's leading convention hotel. With 673 rooms in a shiny modern tower, it meets contemporary standards of service and amenity, but don't look for the personal touch in a place this big. For country-music enthusiasts, the honky-tonks of Lower Broadway and the Ryman Auditorium are within easy walking distance. Double room rates: weekends, $99 to $109; midweek, $149 to $169.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>LOVELESS CAFE, 8400 Highway 100, (615) 646-0067. Local foodies complain that tourists have taken over and insist that the salty country ham is not quite as authentic as it once was. Maybe so. But the fried chicken, scratch biscuits, sweet shoepeg corn and red-eye gravy still have that down-home flavor, and the fabulous peach and blackberry preserves are still made in big kettles right on the spot. You eat at tables with red-checkered cloths, served by waitresses with personalities as sweet as sorghum.</p>
        <p>ROTIER'S, 2413 Elliston Place, (615) 327-9892. This beloved hole in the wall near Vanderbilt University has been serving things like buttermilk and chicken-gizzard dinners since 1945. Evelyn Rotier, who founded it with her late husband, still comes to work three days a week. What keeps the place full are a list of 50 beers and the truly exceptional grilled hamburgers, served on toast.</p>
        <p>SASSO, 1400 Woodland Street, (615) 226-7942. Corey Griffith, who cooks in this agreeable little East Nashville hot spot, says he's shooting for quality ''without glitter or glare.'' He does well by salmon: salmon cakes remoulade at lunch, a fillet in a Szechuan peanut crust at dinner. There's wit at work, too; the menu offers ''roasted airline chicken breast'' as well as ''swine-whine'' barbecue. Fish and chips come wrapped in The Tennessean.</p>
        <p>SUNSET GRILL, 2001 Belcourt Avenue, (615) 386-3663. A lot of music-industry executives eat at this glossy, relaxed restaurant, with a good, mostly modestly priced wine list. Pastas, salads, stir-fries and grills dominate the menu. You'll probably encounter the odd bit of weirdness, like swordfish stuffed with Brie, together with a lot of imagination, like shrimp with a brisk roasted-cumin salsa and a boffo butterscotch-habanero bread pudding.</p>
        <p>WILD BOAR, 2014 Broadway, (615) 329-1313. The atmosphere is rather sepulchral, but there is nothing gloomy about the food. Tiny bouchot mussels in a light curry sauce, perfectly roasted quail and a fruit extravaganza (peach ice cream served in a tuile, alongside delectably ripe peaches on a peach bavarois) all showed solid craftsmanship. Seafood, from scallops to grouper, is bought from day boats. The wine list astonished us: 15,000 bottles, from $35 to $5,000, many of them old vintages of a sort rare in this country (to say nothing of France).</p>
        <p>ZOLA, 3001 West End Avenue, (615) 320-7778. Debra Paquette scores some successes, like a stacked salad of yellow and red tomatoes, with herbed goat cheese, avocado and a topknot of mango chutney, which seemed a definition of good midsummer eating. I also liked the ice cream flavored with Moroccan spices. But many of the dishes of Greek, Turkish and Italian inspiration tasted as if every ingredient in the souk had gone into them.</p>
