        <p>Not counting the yapping cocker spaniel that was terrifying some men who were practicing witchcraft in the jungle the night before and now feared being found out by the sharp-eyed dog, this town was pretty much dead on a recent Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>A drizzle from the clouds on this side of the volcanic island of Bioko -- slightly more than half the size of the state of Rhode Island -- had kept most people indoors. A handful of children splashed in the murky canal that snakes through this town. A large monkey lay dead on a front porch, waiting only for the kitchen.</p>
        <p>A knock on the governor's temporary house (the longtime president of this tiny Central African nation, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, has grown so fond of the governor's house that he has appropriated it for his visits here) found the man in question, Deogracias Miguel Olomo, looking relaxed in sweats.</p>
        <p>''Just a couple of years ago, there was absolutely nothing here,'' Governor Olomo told an unexpected visitor. ''Now Luba can be, well, not the capital. But it can be the economic capital.''</p>
        <p>If Luba, population 3,000, is thinking big these days, it is merely a reflection of the national mood. Equatorial Guinea, once the penniless neighbor in a region awash with oil, has finally hit the jackpot. With perhaps 120,000 barrels a day of crude, and much more to come, forgotten towns are now daring to dream of El Dorado.</p>
        <p>After the Spanish colonialists left in 1968, Luba, despite being the second town on this island after the national capital, Malabo, sank into darkness. With nothing going on here, people stepped back into the jungle to hunt and grow crops. The roads linking Luba to Malabo to the north and Riaba to the east became virtually impassable.</p>
        <p>Today, while much of the road to Riaba remains hidden under overgrown trees and bush, workers are digging up and paving over the way to Malabo. A new port for the oil companies is being built here.</p>
        <p>As for Equatorial Guinea's government, it says it wants to develop every town in the country. And to that effect, it has adopted a novel strategy: in June it moved the entire government, or most of it, off this island and onto the mainland in the city of Bata.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Nguema Lima, the secretary of state at the Ministry of Mines and Energy and a son of President Obiang, explained that the move would perhaps last six months. After that, the government will keep moving to other towns, returning to Malabo after an indefinite journey, Mr. Nguema added.</p>
        <p>In Malabo, the move caught most people unawares. That was hardly a surprise in a country with no daily newspapers and a history of authoritarian, corrupt governments.</p>
        <p>At El Sabroson, a restaurant on Avenida de la Independencia, a couple of days before he was scheduled to join his colleagues in Bata, the information minister, Lucas Nguema Esono Mbang, was having lunch with a ponytailed Spanish businessman.</p>
        <p>''By moving the government away from here,'' the information minister said, picking at his plate of antipasto, ''we can redevelop the entire country.''</p>
        <p>The Spanish businessman, who was awarded a government contract earlier that day, nodded.</p>
        <p>''In fact,'' the information minister went on, ''Spain should follow our example by moving the government to Barcelona or the Basque country.''</p>
        <p>''Exactamente,'' the Spanish businessman said, looking down at his plate.</p>
        <p>''You know, he is a great admirer of Franco,'' the minister said of the businessman.</p>
        <p>''It's true,'' the businessman said. ''Authority is good! That's why this country is good. You can leave 100,000 francs on this table,'' or about $150, he went on, ''and no one will take it. Liberty! What is liberty if you cannot leave 100,000 francs on this table without worrying?''</p>
        <p>A few blocks away, at the headquarters of the Union Popular, an opposition party, people ascribed different motives to the government's move to Bata.</p>
        <p>Fabian Nsue Nguema, the party's secretary general, brought up the point that in the final months of the administration of Francisco Macias Nguema, the country's first president, the government was also moved to the mainland. President Macias, a brutal dictator, eventually placed the government in his hometown, Mongomo, at the country's easternmost point. Shortly after that, he was toppled and then executed by his nephew, the current president, in 1979.</p>
        <p>''It's a dictatorship,'' Mr. Nsue said of the government. ''What distinguishes dictatorships is that they are afraid. So they are afraid and want to move from place to place.''</p>
        <p>Agapito Ona Nguema, another party officer, added: ''Why do they have to move from place to place to develop the country? Your government in Washington, does it have to move to New York or Los Angeles to develop them? And yet they are developed, right?''</p>
        <p>The president's family, a subclan of the Fang ethnic group, has controlled the country since independence. Though they come from the mainland, they have governed from Malabo, the capital established by the Spaniards. An ethnic group known as the Bubi makes up the indigenous people of Malabo and the rest of the island of Bioko.</p>
        <p>A couple of years ago, enough resentment toward the mainland rulers had built up that some Bubi rebels killed two soldiers here in Luba and marched north toward Malabo. They were stopped near the capital by soldiers, who are believed to have carried out reprisal attacks in and around Luba.</p>
        <p>These days, things seemed to have settled down. Filiberto Estrada, 27, a mason, is one of the many people who have gravitated here after hearing of job opportunities. He has not found one yet, complaining, as do many other jobless young men, that the jobs go to those with connections to the governing party.</p>
        <p>He did not understand why the government was packing up and going to Bata.</p>
        <p>''It's the first time I've heard of it,'' Mr. Estrada said. He added, with a smile: ''Each country has its own way of doing things. And here in Equatorial Guinea, we have our own way of doing things.''</p>
