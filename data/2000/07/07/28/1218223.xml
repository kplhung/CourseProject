        <p>Stephen M. Case and Gerald M. Levin came to Washington today to defend the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner against a rising tide of criticism that the new colossus will be so anticompetitive that it must be reined in by regulators even before its creation.</p>
        <p>As they have in the past, Mr. Case, chairman and chief executive of AOL, and Mr. Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, vowed to keep their cable, broadcast and Internet systems open to rivals, and said it would be against their business interests to discriminate against other companies that rely on them.</p>

        <p>Stephen M. Case and Gerald M. Levin came to Washington today to defend the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner against a rising tide of criticism that the new colossus will be so anticompetitive that it must be reined in by regulators even before its creation.</p>
        <p>As they have in the past, Mr. Case, chairman and chief executive of AOL, and Mr. Levin, his counterpart at Time Warner, vowed to keep their cable, broadcast and Internet systems open to rivals, and said it would be against their business interests to discriminate against other companies that rely on them.</p>
        <p>''It has been suggested that a combined AOL-Time Warner might somehow favor our content over that of competitors,'' Mr. Case said. ''Let me be very clear: AOL has never done anything like that, and we never would -- because it would diminish our members' online experience. For the same reasons, a combined AOL- Time Warner would build on our companies' demonstrated commitment to open access.''</p>
        <p>But critics and some commissioners suggested restrictions might be necessary to force the company to honor its commitments. They also noted that neither Mr. Case nor Mr. Levin would say precisely when they would open AOL's instant messaging service to competing systems, or when Time Warner would begin offering rival Internet service providers access to its cable systems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Case and Mr. Levin were the lead witnesses in a five-hour hearing this afternoon at the Federal Communications Commission that offered the first glimpse of the thinking at the agency's highest ranks. The commissioners' questions and comments appeared to confirm the conventional wisdom that the deal will not be blocked, although it appeared possible that significant conditions would be imposed to prevent the new company from shutting out competitors.</p>
        <p>Executives on both sides of the high-profile debate agree that its outcome will shape the Internet landscape and its regulation for years to come, laying down broad principles about Washington's role in assuring that the marketplace remains both open and innovative.</p>
        <p>The consumer groups, along with the Walt Disney Company, NBC and a host of Internet service providers and telephone companies, have raised concerns about the deal coming in the midst of a digital revolution that is slowly blurring the lines between telephones, televisions and the Internet.</p>
        <p>They say that the convergence of these technologies makes it dangerous to put too much control of the market in the hands of AOL and Time Warner, which could give them the ability to shut rivals out of  developing areas like interactive television, instant messaging and digital telephony services, and could slow Internet connections between rival content providers and consumers.</p>
        <p>Critic after critic told the commissioners that there was no reason for the government to trust promises by Mr. Case and Mr. Levin to keep their system open. The critics reminded the commissioners that America Online's instant messaging system does not work with competing systems and that Time Warner had shut ABC off its cable television systems earlier this year in the middle of a commercial dispute.</p>
        <p>''What remains is for their promises and polices to be refined and codified as conditions to approving the deal,'' said William Reddersen, executive vice president of BellSouth, which offers its own high-speed Internet alternative over telephone lines. ''They are saying trust me, in an area where they have not allowed their systems to always be open in the past.''</p>
        <p>Walt Disney, another rival, has complained that AOL's 23 million subscribers ''spend 85 percent of their time within its 'walled garden' rather than the Internet at large.'' That, Disney says, demonstrates ''the extent of AOL's power and the ability to exclude competition.''</p>
        <p>But Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, dismissed Disney's complaints as nothing more than ''a series of business disputes that are being dressed up to be policy disputes.''</p>
        <p>''It's money, that's what this is about,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some commissioners suggested that they were uncomfortable imposing regulations on a marketplace that is developing so rapidly and unpredictably.</p>
        <p>''We are faced with a merger that is born from a revolution that is in its infancy, and the merger's great promise and possible dangers rest principally in the future -- a future that changes rapidly and often unpredictably,'' said Michael Powell, a commissioner. ''It is very difficult to grasp the effect of this combination on consumers in markets that have barely emerged, or have yet to be created even.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the prevailing view among lobbyists and government officials is that it is far more likely that the Federal Trade Commission, which is also reviewing the deal, would impose more stringent conditions than the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>But the trade commission's authority is limited to interpreting antitrust laws and court cases that give it less leeway than the communications commission, particularly in cases involving so-called vertical integration between a producer and distributor. The F.C.C., by contrast, has the authority to do virtually anything it wants under Federal telecommunications law, which allows commissioners to approve any deal that serves a nebulous standard of promoting the ''public interest.''</p>
        <p>Still, a few of the commissioners at the F.C.C., expressed some concerns about the implications of a merger that combines the world's largest Internet service company with the world's largest media and entertainment conglomerate.</p>
        <p>''This proposed merger is not only one of the largest in United States history, but combines the control of conduit and content in an unprecedented fashion, implicating issues that are at the core of our democracy,'' Gloria Tristani said. ''It raises the specter of barriers to the free flow in the marketplace of ideas that has been the essence of our democracy. If the shelves in the marketplace of ideas are stocked by too few hands, a kind of digital imperialism may replace a well-informed citizenry.''</p>
