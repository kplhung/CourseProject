        <p>The Republican National Committee voted today to make the presidential nominating season last until May by requiring big states to hold their primaries last. But the plan faces a stiff fight in the national convention's rules committee on Friday and perhaps on the convention floor next Monday.</p>
        <p>The vote today was 92 to 55. Most of the opposition came from big states, like New York, California and Illinois, which would be permitted to hold primaries or caucuses no earlier than the first Tuesday in May. And while each state has three votes on the national committee, and two on the rules committee, the bigger states have more votes in the convention.</p>

        <p>The Republican National Committee voted today to make the presidential nominating season last until May by requiring big states to hold their primaries last. But the plan faces a stiff fight in the national convention's rules committee on Friday and perhaps on the convention floor next Monday.</p>
        <p>The vote today was 92 to 55. Most of the opposition came from big states, like New York, California and Illinois, which would be permitted to hold primaries or caucuses no earlier than the first Tuesday in May. And while each state has three votes on the national committee, and two on the rules committee, the bigger states have more votes in the convention.</p>
        <p>Proponents argued that the new system, in which a majority of delegates would be elected in May, would allow Republicans in all states to cast votes that mattered. This year the nominations of both major parties were settled in March, before  many states had voted.</p>
        <p>Morton Blackwell, a national committeeman from Virginia, argued that if the party did nothing, states would continue to move their primaries to the earliest possible date. That, he said, would create a national primary, which could be won only by someone with enough money to campaign everywhere at once, or by someone ''beloved by the media''  and favored with magazine covers and television interviews.</p>
        <p>But opponents argued that coming late would deprive them of influence, and also warned that Democratic governors and Democratic-controlled legislatures would refuse to shift primary dates, thus forcing Republicans either to hold caucuses or to pay for their own primaries. John Fleischman, executive director of California's Republican Party, said this would cost the party $15 million to $20 million or more.</p>
        <p>Supporters like Richard Forsten, general counsel of the Delaware party, argued that with the flexibility that the proposed rule would give the Republican National Committee, such problems would be worked out amicably. Though he did not mention it, the Democratic National Committee has the authority to change delegate-selection rules, including primary dates, between elections and to grant waivers to states that want to break them.</p>
        <p>But the Republican proposal's comparable flexibility, which its advocates said was essential to make it work, runs counter to Republican tradition, in which the rules are set once every four years, at the national convention. And the idea of changing that will stir hostility in the convention's rules committee.</p>
        <p>However the rules committee decides, the vote is likely to be close enough for the losing side to take the issue to the floor, a step that would require the signatures of 27 of the committee's 107 members. Both Mr. Fleischman, opposing the plan, and Tom Sansonetti of Wyoming, chairman of the national committee's  rules panel, which produced it, said today that they were ready to go to the floor.</p>
        <p>That could be forestalled by the presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, which has been structuring the convention to make it free of controversy. But the spectacle of politicians' arguing about political calendars, rather than something so emotional as abortion, might not seem harmful, especially if it took place on Monday morning, when only a couple of cable networks were covering the convention.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush has had nothing to say about the proposal, although recently his aides have said he has some ''concerns'' about it. Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, said in Austin today that ''he has no position on it.''</p>
        <p>But Charles Black Jr., a veteran Republican consultant in Washington who is an adviser to the campaign, said he and several other advisers, acting on their own, were trying to build opposition to the plan.  Mr. Black said that without any sign that Democrats would cooperate, adoption of the proposal could let them pick their nominee by March and start building campaign donations while Republicans continue to  contest their nomination.</p>
        <p>One major supporter of the plan, David Norcross, a national committeeman from New Jersey, backed away from it. He proposed instead a substitute under which only the very smallest states could vote in February; all the others would vote whenever they chose from March to June, as they do now. Mr. Norcross said it was unlikely that the convention's rules committee would accept any change greater than that.</p>
        <p>But the plan was killed on a 95-to-51 vote. Mr. Norcross said it had been suggested to him by Susan Weddington, chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, who said she had never discussed it with Mr. Bush.</p>
