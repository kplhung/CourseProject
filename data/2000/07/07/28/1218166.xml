      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Magnolia</p>
        <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's mosaic mixes a half-dozen lives into an Altmanesque swirl. While the old television mogul Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lies dying and lamenting past indiscretions, his young wife (Julianne Moore) quaffs his painkillers and wails about her own infidelities. Then, to name a few, there are the morose former child television-quiz-show star (William H. Macy), the present whiz kid (Jeremy Blackman) and the strutting macho cult figure (Tom Cruise, above). None of this jells, but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''what Mr. Anderson lacks in substance is offset by his great skill with actors, his gift for shaping resonant little individual vignettes and his extraordinary intuition.''</p>

        <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's mosaic mixes a half-dozen lives into an Altmanesque swirl.

None of this jells, but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''what Mr. Anderson lacks in substance is offset by his great skill with actors, his gift for shaping resonant little individual vignettes and his extraordinary intuition.''</p>
        <p>1999. New Line. $108.77. 188 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Pups</p>
        <p>A Bonnie and Clyde for the MTV generation, Stevie (Cameron Van Hoy) and Rocky (Mischa Barton) interrupt their walk to school to rob a bank. Angered by neglectful families, the teenagers shoot a guard, take hostages and talk about the ills of society. Among their demands are a visit from MTV, margarita mix, condoms and an end to smoking by the F.B.I. commander (Burt Reynnolds). Written and directed by a filmmaker who goes by the single name Ash, the film ''takes a knowing look at adolescents informed but not educated by television and movies in a less than perfect United States'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>2000. Monarch. $94.95; DVD, $19.95. 103 minutes. R.</p>
        <p>Romeo Must Die</p>
        <p>Don't look for Shakespeare in Andrzej Bartkowiak's hip-hop-kung-fu tale of greed and revenge. Isaak (Delroy Lindo) intimidates waterfront business owners so he can buy up their properties. Trish (Aaliyah) is his attractive daughter, and Han (Jet Li, the Hong Kong action star) wants to avenge the killing of his little brother. A sleek look and well-selected soundtrack helps, but the movie is ''overly dutiful in dragging itself through the exercise of playing out its plot elements, ignoring the chief lesson of its Hong Kong antecedents: extend the martial gymnastics'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Warner. $110.97; DVD, $24.98. 115 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Aug.1.</p>
        <p>The Ninth Gate</p>
        <p>Who better than Frank Langella for the role of Boris Balkan, an evil collector of devil-inspired antiquities?</p>
        <p>Johnny Depp is Dean Corso, the rogue book dealer whom Balkan hires to locate a volume called ''The Nine Gates.'' Could Satan have a hand in this one? Actually, three versions of ''Gates'' are at stake, and Corso must stay a step ahead of Liana (Lena Olin), a dangerous widow in black, and a sylph (Emmanuelle Seigner). Trying for both fright and satire, Roman Polanski's film ''is about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of 'The Blair Witch Project,' and not nearly as funny'' (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>1999. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>

        <p>THE BANK DICK and SIX SHORT FILMS OF W. C. FIELDS. Writing ''The Bank Dick'' under the pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves, Fields creates his last role for himself: the drunken Egbert Souse, a habitue of the Black Pussy Cat Cafe who foils a stickup at a bank and is made a security guard at the place (1940, DVD, Criterion Collection/Home Vision, $29.95, 72 minutes). The second disc includes all six of his short films: ''The Pool Sharks'' (1915, 11 minutes), ''The Golf Specialist'' (1930, 21 minutes), ''The Dentist'' (1932, 22 minutes), ''The Fatal Glass of Beer'' (1933, 19 minutes), ''The Pharmacist'' (1933, 20 minutes) and ''The Barber Shop'' (1933, 22 minutes).
