        <p>Attacking her opponent as ''out of touch with the mainstream,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton seemed to take some delight yesterday in pointing to Representative Rick A. Lazio's links to a dissident band of scientists who contend that the human immunodeficiency virus does not cause AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, wrote to federal health officials earlier this year on behalf of the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of H.I.V./AIDS. The group is connected to two scientists, Peter Deusberg and David Resnick, to whom the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, also apparently turned earlier this year in questioning the causes of AIDS.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lazio's campaign aides said he wrote to officials with the Health and Human Services Department and the National Institutes of Health on behalf of a constituent, who belonged to the group. Molly Fullington, a spokeswoman for the Lazio campaign, said the group was trying to secure federal financing to conduct research on ''the underlying causes of AIDS and to fund holistic approaches to treatment.''</p>
        <p>She said she could not comment on whether Mr. Lazio knew of the group's disputed belief. But, she said, ''Rick Lazio does not hold their view that H.I.V. does not cause AIDS,'' adding that ''he believes it does.''</p>
        <p>The report of Mr. Lazio's advocacy of the dissident AIDS group was first published yesterday in The New York Post. Mrs. Clinton seized on the report at a news conference to announce endorsements from two gay and lesbian groups, the Human Rights Campaign and Empire State Pride Agenda. ''It was a further piece of evidence as to why my opponent doesn't get it,'' she said, urging him to engage in debates statewide.</p>
        <p>Officials with the two organizations that announced their support yesterday pointed to her advocacy of issues important to gay and lesbian voters, from her support of hate-crimes laws to backing the right of gay couples to be foster and adoptive parents. Mrs. Clinton, her backers said yesterday, has also supported the right of openly gay people to serve in the military -- in sharp contrast to the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy of the White House and Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''This is not a close call,'' Tim Sweeney, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda said in announcing his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. ''He's not even Al D'Amato.''</p>
        <p>The gay community split over the question of Mr. D'Amato in the last Senate race in New York, with the Human Rights Campaign backing Mr. D'Amato over his Democratic opponent, Charles E. Schumer. But this time, officials with the Human Rights Campaign said, there was no disagreement.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio has had ample opportunity to support our issues,'' said the group's executive director, Elizabeth Birch. ''And time and time again, he has come up short or come up empty.''</p>
        <p>As for Mrs. Clinton's invitation to debate, Mr. Lazio's aides welcomed it. Michael Marr, a spokesman, described it as an opportunity to highlight ''the difference between the candidate who has a real record of legislative achievement and a candidate who has no such record.''</p>
