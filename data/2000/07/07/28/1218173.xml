        <p>Sam Waterston plays a complicated hero in ''A House Divided.'' He's a slave owner who rapes his house servant, a black teenager, and then -- many years later -- hires a lawyer to make sure their daughter isn't denied her inheritance.</p>
        <p>This Showtime movie is what Hollywood agents call, with deadly reduction, an ''issue-driven narrative.'' But, thanks to a careful, hard-nosed script and fine performances, it sidesteps many hazards of the genre.

His motives for doing the right thing are selfish and dramatically interesting: he adores his only child, wants her to have whatever he can give her, and seems determinedly oblivious to the hostility her black genes might arouse in the slave-owning South.</p>

        <p>Sam Waterston plays a complicated hero in ''A House Divided.'' He's a slave owner who rapes his house servant, a black teenager, and then -- many years later -- hires a lawyer to make sure their daughter isn't denied her inheritance.</p>
        <p>This Showtime movie is what Hollywood agents call, with deadly reduction, an ''issue-driven narrative.'' But, thanks to a careful, hard-nosed script and fine performances, it sidesteps many hazards of the genre. Love for his mixed-race child doesn't suddenly politicize the Waterston character, David Dickson, or make him endearing, or even worse, drive him to speechmaking. His motives for doing the right thing are selfish and dramatically interesting: he adores his only child, wants her to have whatever he can give her, and seems determinedly oblivious to the hostility her black genes might arouse in the slave-owning South.</p>
        <p>When he discovers that Julia, the girl he raped, tried to abort her pregnancy (graphically depicted on screen), he goes to her room and says, ''Just go on and have that baby and we'll all forget about it.'' While he acknowledges he may have behaved inappropriately (by raping her), he doesn't apologize. He simply wants her to understand that his lust had already been converted into parental pride, even before his daughter was born, and that Julia shouldn't interfere with his newfound feeling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waterston has to play Dickson across several decades, so he seems a little too old to be living with his mother, as he did at the times of his daughter's violent conception and throughout her upbringing. But he uses his wrinkles and a mop of stringy, untamed hair -- and his trademark perplexity -- to emphasize Dickson's eccentricity. He was far more interested in improving his farm (experimenting with bat dung as fertilizer) than politics. He owned slaves and supported the Confederacy during the Civil War, but wasn't cruel -- apart from the inherent cruelty of the institution and his complicity in it.</p>
        <p>True to his word, he keeps his relationship with Julia businesslike. Once he discovers her skill in mathematics and sense of logic, he gives her increasing responsibility for management of the farm. So even after slavery ends, she remains there -- but not there in her rightful place, as her child's mother. Her daughter Amanda loves her -- as a servant -- but thinks her real mother died in childbirth.</p>
        <p>She is able to believe this fiction because she looks white. The filmmakers don't exactly explain how the other slaves on the farm -- who must have noticed what was happening in the big house -- didn't spill the beans. We are only shown what happens when Amanda grows up. These household secrets erupt to call into question her happy childhood, and indeed, her place in the universe.</p>
        <p>This improbable family drama might have been imagined by Tennessee Williams, and then who knows what would have transpired. Instead it was inspired by, of all things, actual events as described in a doctoral thesis, ''Woman of Color, Daughter of Privilege,'' by Kent Anderson Leslie, and published in 1995 by the University of Georgia Press. Ms. Leslie based much of her research on records of the real-life trial that determined whether Amanda America Dickson was her father's rightful heir.</p>
        <p>The film's director, John Kent Harrison, and its screenwriter, Paris Qualles, have conventionally structured this psychologically fraught drama. They use the trial as the centerpiece for their story, which unfolds in a series of explanatory flashbacks. The segues to the past are purely functional. ''Where did it start?,'' Dickson's lawyer asks, for example, to instigate one memory trip. The music, too, feels familiar --  sorrowful wails to let us know that slavery was sad and evil, as if we didn't know.</p>
        <p>But the characterizations and acting rise above the stylistic platitudes. Jennifer Beals conveys Amanda's hurt -- and charm and sturdiness -- with a credible combination of hesitation and fortitude. Tim Daly is suitably bland and earnest as Charles Dubose, the young lawyer Dickson entrusted with the job of drafting his will and having its provisions honored. Since the will was read after Dickson's death in 1874, in the Reconstruction era, the issue wasn't whether a slave could inherit property. Rather, his brother (who wanted the land) argued that Dickson hadn't been competent when he drafted the will. But, of course, race still was the issue.</p>
        <p>Dubose never existed but is a fictionalized composite of the many lawyers who actually argued the case. He was evidently created to represent the post-Civil War New South, where one form of selfish interest (the protection of individual rights) supersedes another (sentimental bigotry). The filmmakers have him hail, appropriately, from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The film's most subtle and lovely portrait captures the alliance -- resembling a certain kind of postsexual marital arrangement -- that develops between Dickson and Julia, who is elegantly played by LisaGay Hamilton of the television series ''The Practice.'' She convincingly portrays Julia's development from a surprisingly innocent girl (considering her uprooted childhood, even before the rape) to a stoical but uncompromising adult. Julia is wise, but not annoying. You believe in her as a hurt woman who has carved herself a dignified path through hardship.</p>
        <p>When Dickson is old (and Mr. Waterston's hair is gray as well as ratty), taking account of his life and their relationship, he describes their partnership as ''pretty good.'' The look Julia sends him transmits every layer of text and subtext he has had to ignore to reach that conclusion. Then she says, ''Yes, Master David,'' because she knows there's no point in saying anything else. It's a powerful moment, capturing a lifetime of hypocrisy, devotion and habit.</p>
