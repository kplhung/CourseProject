        <p>He promised a revolution, and he has kept his word. Since being swept to power here 18 months ago, Hugo Chavez has uprooted every institution, assaulted every elite and derided every orthodoxy with the unrelenting combativeness of the army paratrooper he used to be.</p>
        <p>The Congress and Supreme Court he called ''corrupt'' and ''worm eaten'' are gone, and the two political parties that governed for 40 years have collapsed. The military's role  has been vastly expanded, the powerful government oil company he criticized as ''a state within the state'' has been purged, and the authority of governors and mayors has been curtailed.</p>
        <p>In speech after speech, he has attacked the business, opposition and media leaders who have expressed doubts about his methods and objectives, calling them ''degenerates'' and ''squealing pigs.'' When Roman Catholic bishops dared suggest that he should be less confrontational, he dismissed them as ''devils in vestments.''</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of Mr. Chavez's plan to transform Venezuela, which has been the United States' leading source of imported oil in recent years, is a new Constitution he hails as ''the most democratic in the world.'' Hand-tailored for him in a Constituent Assembly dominated by his leftist Patriotic Pole movement, it enlarges the powers of the state while weakening the legislature and judiciary.</p>
        <p>Now the former army colonel, who will be 46 on Friday, seems assured of at least six more years in office, thanks to provisions in the new charter that extend the presidential term by one year and eliminate a ban on immediate re-election. An election scheduled for Sunday to ''relegitimize'' his rule and choose governors and a new Congress is expected to hand him a sweeping victory.</p>
        <p>''Oligarchs tremble, because now is when the revolution is going forward,'' he warned recently. ''This is going to be delicious: we're going to deliver a knockout punch to the counterrevolution.''</p>
        <p>For the Latin American left, hungry for a home-grown hero, Mr. Chavez is a godsend: a charismatic military man who condemns ''savage capitalism,'' embraces Fidel Castro and promises social justice. An orator who is by turns spellbinding and funny, Mr. Chavez has gathered the poor into a powerful force that is demanding change.</p>
        <p>But for many others, unwilling to forget the unsuccessful coup he led eight years ago, Mr. Chavez reawakens memories of the authoritarian caudillo -- the classic military strongman with little patience for the give-and-take of democracy. To them, his language reeks of class hatred and demagoguery, his vituperative attacks foreshadowing even greater conflicts to come.</p>
        <p>''His movement is contradictory, and Hugo Chavez is a divided soul,'' said Teodoro Petkoff, a former guerrilla and government official who is now editor of an irreverent new daily newspaper here, Tal Cual. ''At the same time he is Menshevik and Bolshevik, Girardist and Jacobin, Danton and Robespierre.''</p>
        <p>In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez seems to be everywhere, his image plastered on posters, his voice booming over the airwaves. But the man himself -- as well as a clear picture of how he intends to exercise the enormous power he has been accumulating -- remains elusive.</p>
        <p>He was elected in a landslide in December 1998 by promising a ''peaceful social revolution'' that would usher in a ''golden age.'' So far he has failed to deliver either prosperity or equality: the Venezuelan economy shrank by 7 percent last year, and more than half the work force remains unemployed or is working in the underground economy. The well-off, fearful of his declarations, have spirited more than $8 billion out of the country, mostly to the United States, since he came to power, according to  Venezuelan central bank data.</p>
        <p>He has ordered government security forces not to move against squatters who invade buildings or farms, and has just backed a measure that would expropriate landholdings that the government deems to be ''idle.''</p>
        <p>His followers, drawn from the 80 percent of Venezuelans who live below the poverty line, have been kept in a permanent state of agitation. His speeches refer to his ''plan of battle,'' the need to ''take every piece of space by assault'' and efforts to ''force the adversaries of the people into their caves and foxholes,'' but offer few policy specifics.</p>
        <p>Former Officers at His Side</p>
        <p>''Now brothers, let us unsheath the sword of truth,'' Mr. Chavez intoned in a recent speech. ''All of you are warriors, so let us once again seek the oracle of war and put on our combat boots. I am certain that from today on the popular offensive will be as implacable as ever and that the attack will come from all sides because the Venezuelan people have clasped their banner and are going on to battle and victory again.''</p>
        <p>Given his two decades in the army, it is hardly surprising that Mr. Chavez's public declarations have a martial tone or that he has brought large numbers of former military officers into his government.</p>
        <p>''Von Clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics by other means, but it also works the other way around,'' he said in an interview. ''Whether it be war or some other kind of challenge, you are always talking about struggle, battles, advances and retreats.''</p>
        <p>But he also draws heavily on religious imagery, comparing himself to Jesus and his opponents to the demons of the apocalypse. When Roman Catholic bishops sent him a letter last spring cautioning him that it was false to suggest that ''God has blessed one political project'' above others, he responded with a 20-page letter that read like a papal encyclical, complete with biblical citations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez leavens his aggressive remarks with jokes, proverbs, bits of popular songs, asides to his wife, Marisabel, and anecdotes about friends, his boyhood and his days as a baseball player. His opponents say they find his performances coarse and clownish, but his folksy approach has helped cement his ties to ordinary Venezuelans. ''He is one of us,'' said Beatriz Tovar Mendieta, a washerwoman here. ''We've never had another president like that before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez is also more closely identified with the masses in terms of the ethnic or racial divide that characterizes Venezuela. The predecessors he attacks as members of a ''rotten oligarchic elite'' are typical ''mantuanos,'' as people with European features  and pretensions are called here.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Chavez is a typical ''pardo,'' or brown-skinned person, with traces of Indian blood, ''curly hair, Chinese-looking eyes, a thick mouth and an aquiline nose,'' in the words of one of his biographers, Angela Zago. In speeches, the president has been known to underline his resemblance to his followers by referring to himself as ''the Indian from Barinas.''</p>
        <p>William Lara, who met the president when both were studying political science in a postgraduate course a decade ago and is now one of his closest political advisers, said: ''Like Hugo Chavez I am from the plains, which is a place that has very few trees. So when a plainsman sees a tree, his first impulse is to look behind it to see if someone is waiting there to ambush him. Hugo Chavez has that characteristic.''</p>
        <p>Combined with that self-reliance is a distrust of and disdain for technocrats that leads him to rely on his own instincts more than advice from experts. ''You need to take an aspirin, but they prescribe Viagra,'' Mr. Chavez complained in a recent speech.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez's relationship with the United States is no less complicated. Aside from a passion for baseball that works its way into almost every speech, he is a fan of American movies and television, referring to them  almost as frequently as he adorns his speeches with quotations from Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy and Walt Whitman.</p>
        <p>U.S. Help Is Rejected</p>
        <p>But when floods and mudslides inundated the Caribbean coast last December, killing thousands, Mr. Chavez refused help from an American military team. Their presence, he said, would offend Venezuela's sovereignty, even though he allowed in doctors from Cuba, relief workers from Spain and Mexico, and aid from China and Pakistan.</p>
        <p>He personally takes responsibility for the dramatic rise in oil prices and record gasoline prices in the United States. On the campaign trail here, he reminds voters it was his government's decision to lower production and adhere to OPEC quotas that has resulted in a quadrupling of the price of a barrel of Venezuelan crude since he took office 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>Not only has Venezuela often been the leading source of oil for the United States, but the country's minister of energy, Ali Rodriguez, is now OPEC president. In recent speeches, Mr. Chavez has bragged to Venezuelans about telephone calls from President Clinton asking for relief on oil prices, but he has also made it clear that he does not intend to give any ground.</p>
        <p>Once the election is over, Mr. Chavez plans a Mideast tour to discuss with ''our Arab brothers,'' as he calls them, an OPEC heads of state meeting scheduled here in late September. Although he plans stops in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Mr. Chavez seems bent on tweaking Washington by visiting Iraq, Iran and Libya, and inviting their leaders to the conference.</p>
        <p>''Imagine what the pharisees will say when they see me with Saddam Hussein,'' Mr. Chavez said with a big grin in a recent  speech.</p>
        <p>Indeed, his foreign policy has shown a fascination with rogue elements around the world. One peculiar example is his correspondence with Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, the Venezuelan-born former guerrilla known as Carlos the Jackal, who was convicted of murder and kidnappings across Europe and once organized an attack on OPEC ministers.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Chavez has cited the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya as a model for participatory democracy. He has also repeatedly praised Mr. Castro's rule in Cuba, much to the distress of Venezuelans still resentful of Cuban support for past guerrilla movements here, saying both nations are ''swimming together toward the same sea of happiness.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez withdrew Venezuela from annual American-sponsored joint naval maneuvers and this week accused the United States of trying to install a missile base in neighboring Guyana. But perhaps most immediately troubling to Washington is his decision to ban American drug surveillance flights from using Venezuelan airspace.</p>
        <p>For now, the American response has been restrained, arguing, no doubt with an eye on oil supplies, that forbearance and dialogue are the best way to avoid further radicalization of the situation here.</p>
        <p>But Republican members of Congress are clamoring for sanctions against Venezuela, and the United States ambassador who has been carrying out the wait-and-see policy here is to be succeeded next month by Donna Jean Hrinak, who as ambassador to the Dominican Republic took a hard line against that country's wily authoritarian president, Joaquin Balaguer.</p>
        <p>'A Tough Little Kid'</p>
        <p>Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias was born in Sabaneta de Barinas, a small town in the vast, sparsely populated savannah that is Venezuela's equivalent of the Great Plains. As teachers in the local elementary school, his parents, Hugo de los Reyes Chavez and Helena Frias, had social but not material status.</p>
        <p>''We grew up there selling bananas and sowing corn'' and when students finished the sixth grade ''we had to go somewhere else, to the state capital, if we were going to continue our studies,'' Mr. Chavez recalled in an autobiography.</p>
        <p>The new student in the capital was first ridiculed as a bumpkin but soon stood out for his ability to recite poems and speeches at festivals and for athletic prowess. Baseball is the national pastime, and Mr. Chavez excelled as both a left-handed pitcher and a power-hitting first baseman.</p>
        <p>''He was a tough little kid, mischievous, a real talker and dreamer, but as tenacious as hell,'' Jose (Tintan) Lopez, Mr. Chavez's baseball coach, said in an interview. ''Even when he was 7 or 8, he could put the ball where he wanted and wasn't afraid to come in on a batter with his fastball.''</p>
        <p>Indirectly, it was baseball that led to Mr. Chavez's military career. His plan was to qualify for the army's team and capture the attention of major league scouts.</p>
        <p>But he soon developed arm trouble, and his ambitions shifted. ''When I met some officers and read a bit of history, I felt something stirring inside me,'' he has said.  He drew inspiration from Latin American military leaders like Juan Velasco of Peru, Juan Peron of Argentina and Omar Torrijos of Panama -- men who used their power to shake up the status quo, not reinforce it.</p>
        <p>After graduation he was assigned to a succession of posts: an armored unit, antiguerrilla duty along the Colombian border, a military ethics instructor, paratrooper training and eventually staff duty at the Ministry of Defense. But there was also a conspiratorial side he was careful to keep hidden from his superiors.</p>
        <p>''We were a group of four or five captains who used to jog together in the afternoons, and one day in 1983 Chavez suggested we swear an oath to fight against corruption and for the welfare of our country,'' recalled Jesus Urdaneta Hernandez, a former classmate and friend who recently broke with the president. ''From that moment on, we began to study the problems of Venezuela in a systematic way, and as time passed we got more and more young officers to join us.''</p>
        <p>After world oil prices collapsed in the early 1980's, neither of the country's two political parties proved able to govern effectively or honestly in a situation that called for belt-tightening. In 1989, a popular uprising against an International Monetary Fund austerity program resulted in the deaths of several hundred people and convinced Mr. Chavez and his co-conspirators that the system could no longer function.</p>
        <p>A Turning Point in Life</p>
        <p>On Feb. 4, 1992, Mr. Chavez, Francisco Arias Cardenas, then his closest comrade in arms but now his challenger in Sunday's vote, and other officers attacked the presidential palace. It was a bloody failure, resulting in the deaths of more than a score of soldiers. But most Venezuelans caught their first glance of their future leader then, and Mr. Chavez has described the episode as the turning point in his life.</p>
        <p>After surrendering, he was paraded in front of television cameras, wearing the bright red military beret that he and his followers today wear as the symbol of their movement, to call on the last holdout units to lay down their arms.</p>
        <p>''For now, comrades, the objectives that we established have unfortunately not been achieved in the capital,'' the young army colonel said, with a touch of bravado that resonated deeply among ordinary people. Then he was bundled off to jail.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Chavez's own account, the two-plus years he spent there were devoted largely to reading and debating. In an interview last year, Mr. Chavez described himself as ''a promiscuous reader,'' with a reading list that included Camus, Cicero, Martin Luther King, Mao, Montesquieu, Neruda, Nietzche, Ortega y Gasset, Rousseau, Alvin Toffler and Walt Whitman.</p>
        <p>Visitors of all political persuasions were allowed to see him, including some of the most influential members of what is now his government. Among them were two veterans of the left who would become his mentors: Luis Miquilena, now head of the Congress, and Jose Vicente Rangel, his foreign minister.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Chavez was freed in 1994, Mr. Miquilena and other admirers decided he needed to travel abroad because he knew little of the world.</p>
        <p>Because of his role in the attempted overthrow of a democratically elected government, the United States refused to grant him a visa, a policy that remained in effect until he was elected president. But he traveled throughout Latin America, and on one trip he met an obscure Argentine sociologist named Norberto Ceresole.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ceresole's language can be murky, but in essence he envisions political leadership as an almost mystical bond between the masses and a charismatic figure. Such a ''post-democratic'' relationship eliminates the need for political parties, he argues, because the military can more reliably serve as a sort of conveyor belt between the leader and the led.</p>
        <p>To critics, such notions are little more than warmed-over fascism. Mr. Ceresole also denies the Holocaust and calls for third world coalitions to counter the power of the United States.</p>
        <p>Just after Mr. Chavez was elected, Mr. Ceresole visited Venezuela and proudly described the president-elect as ''my disciple.'' Mr. Chavez was clearly irritated by the remarks and, according to Mr. Urdaneta, then his secret police chief, ordered the Argentine to leave.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, many Venezuelans remain convinced that Mr. Ceresole's ideas influence Mr. Chavez's government.</p>
        <p>As he was discovering Mr. Ceresole, Mr. Chavez made his first trip to Havana, where he was welcomed by Mr. Castro. At a 1994 news conference there, Mr. Chavez, clearly dazzled by having been treated almost as a head of state, was full of admiration for Mr. Castro and the Cuban revolution. He has continued to visit Havana as president, even playing baseball with Mr. Castro last year, and has offered Cuba economic aid.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Chavez's critics, the president's fascination with two figures as ideologically divergent as Mr. Castro and Mr. Ceresole indicates he has no core beliefs of his own, only a set of postures that he tailors for his audiences.</p>
        <p>''On Wall Street, he talks about the wonders of capitalism, in China he quotes from Chairman Mao, and in England, he praises Tony Blair and the Third Way,'' Mr. Urdaneta said. ''He wants to be on good terms with everybody, so he says what people want to hear. We will only see the true Hugo Chavez emerge after this election.''</p>
        <p>A Time to Deliver</p>
        <p>That chapter will open after the vote on Sunday when pressure to deliver results can only mount.</p>
        <p>But ''there doesn't seem to be a coherent plan,'' said Robert Bottome, editor of Veneconomia, the leading business newsletter here. ''The formal economy is being more and more destroyed, and I don't think it is deliberate. It's just that he doesn't understand, he doesn't know what he's doing.''</p>
        <p>And even as the hour of his greatest triumph draws closer, Mr. Chavez has passed up an opportunity to be magnanimous or conciliatory. Instead, he has stepped up attacks on all who question his vision or recoil at the conflict he says he relishes.</p>
        <p>''There is no third way here,'' he said recently. ''No, here there is only revolution and counterrevolution, and we are going to annihilate the counterrevolution.''</p>
