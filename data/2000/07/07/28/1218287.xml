        <p>The Yankees like to have multiple lines dropped in the trade waters at all times, and at any time between now and Monday's trade deadline, the slight tugs they have been getting from other teams could turn into something more.</p>
        <p>The Yankees like Montreal's Rondell White, an outfielder who can run and hit and would certainly augment their lineup. But White is on the disabled list, nursing a bad hamstring, and two officials familiar with the talks say the Yankees will not conclude a trade of the top prospect Alfonso Soriano until White is activated and shows he is sound enough to play.</p>
        <p>Gene Michael, the Yankees' superscout, was at Shea Stadium today, watching the doubleheader between the Mets and Montreal, and presumably was prepared to evaluate White -- if only he had taken the field. The Expos have three more days to activate White, but to date, the Expos have been reluctant to forward any medical information on White to the Yankees, raising the Yankees' suspicions.</p>
        <p>The Yankees like Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff, who appears to be the first choice among all their options. But the chances of a deal appear remote, unless the talks get a massive shove from one side or the other: the Orioles would have to decide to follow a philosophy of trading veterans like Surhoff and shortstop Mike Bordick for prospects, or the Yankees would have to meet Baltimore's demands for two top prospects.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have offered Dave Walling -- arguably the organization's second-best pitching prospect -- and another secondary prospect in return for Surhoff. The Orioles are beginning to focus on D'Angelo Jimenez, the shortstop who has just barely resumed playing after breaking a bone in his neck in an off-season car accident. Bruce Kison, an Orioles' scout, was in Tampa, Fla., today to watch Jimenez play, and Kison apparently is pushing Baltimore's executives toward making a deal for Walling.</p>
        <p>The Yankees like Matt Clement, the hard-throwing sinkerball pitcher for the San Diego Padres, and are mulling the possibility of swapping Soriano for him. Ted Simmons, among the Padres' top brass, watched the Class AAA Columbus Clippers play Wednesday and saw Soriano play shortstop. Soriano was apparently moved from second base to shortstop specifically for the purpose of allowing Simmons see Soriano play that position. Stump Merrill, the former Yankee manager, has been in Pittsburgh scouting, and he could see Clement pitch against the Pirates Friday.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' rotation is already crammed with five veteran starters, and Orlando Hernandez is expected to be activated off the disabled list in the next two weeks, so it is unclear what the Yankees' immediate plans for Clement would be. But he does not have much service time and his salary will be relatively low in the next couple of years, so he could move into the rotation in 2001.</p>
        <p>Until then, the Yankees might have the option of using him in the bullpen the way they have employed Ramiro Mendoza, and perhaps they could swap Mendoza now for the left fielder they seek, because Mendoza is nearing free agency and due for a huge raise before next season. The Yankeescould conceivably shop around Clement, although that seems unlikely.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have a handful of Plan D options available, from Philadelphia's Ron Gant to the Rangers' Chad Curtis, a former Yankee, to Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero and John Vander Wal. Milwaukee is waiting to be overwhelmed by an offer for the slugger Jeromy Burnitz, and the Yankees could try to put together the necessary package and face huge salary demands from Burnitz, who can become a free agent after the 2001 season. In some ways, the complications of dealing for Burnitz would be the same as they were for Sammy Sosa: significant cost in prospects up front and a major cost in salary in the end, which the Yankees sidestepped when they did not trade for Sosa.</p>
        <p>Returns Apparently Near</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez, coming back from a strained elbow, is progressing in his rehabilitation and is expected to throw to hitters in Tampa, Fla., on Friday. If he gets through that, then he probably will be ready for a minor league rehabilitation assignment. It could be that El Duque is about two weeks away from rejoining the Yankees' rotation, if he does not have a setback.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza, recovering from arm stiffness, will be activated in time for Friday's game. To make room for Mendoza, the Yankees will probably return the right-hander Darrell Einertson to Class AAA.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees' second baseman, who is nursing an elbow strain, took some batting practice today and might play in the next couple of days, Manager Joe Torre said. Knoblauch sustained his injury Monday against the Orioles.</p>
