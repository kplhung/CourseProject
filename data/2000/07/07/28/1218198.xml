        <p>For years, automakers insisted that the technology did not exist to improve the fuel economy of sport utility vehicles and that Americans were not especially interested in gas mileage.</p>
        <p>But today, the Ford Motor Company reversed course and announced plans to improve the gas mileage of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over five years, or roughly five miles a gallon, saying that the technology already exists to do so and that customers actually want better fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Detroit carmakers cited research showing that fuel economy was near the bottom of 25 criteria considered by buyers of sport utility vehicles. But Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said today that fuel economy was among the top 10 criteria for buyers of the vehicles. Ford's market research, rather than the gut instinct of executives, prompted the company's decision to make changes, he said.</p>
        <p>Kelly Brown, Ford's director of vehicle environmental engineering, told reporters here that the technology already existed for improving fuel economy affordably through engine and transmission changes and lighter auto parts.</p>
        <p>''Everything we're doing is something already tested and proven, and some of it is already in production elsewhere'' within Ford, he said.</p>
        <p>Martin B. Zimmerman, Ford's vice president for government affairs, said after Mr. Nasser's speech that while customers seldom volunteered an interest in fuel economy, in-depth research disclosed that buyers wanted better gas mileage.</p>
        <p>''You ask them, 'Do you like our vehicles?' and they say, 'We love them,' '' he said. ''But you ask them, 'What would you like to change?' and they say, 'We'd like greater range, better fuel economy.' ''</p>
        <p>Standing near Mr. Zimmerman, Janet Mullins Grissom, Ford's vice president for Washington affairs, interjected that market research into Americans' views on fuel economy ''is just like polling -- it depends on how you ask the question.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasser and Mr. Brown refused to discuss the technologies or the cost of Ford's decision, saying that this would be valuable information for rivals. People involved in the plan said the cost was considerable but declined to provide figures.</p>
        <p>Analysts said it was impossible to distinguish Ford's fuel-economy spending from other vehicle design costs. And competition from foreign automakers is already forcing Ford to invest more in the design of sport utility vehicles, they added.</p>
        <p>Sport utility vehicles used to be strictly the province of Detroit manufacturers, which were under little pressure to respond to consumer demand. Federal fuel economy rules are much more lenient for sport utility vehicles than for cars. And until a series of court decisions in the early 1990's, the sport utility market, unlike the car market, was protected by stiff import taxes that discouraged foreign automakers.</p>
        <p>Now, foreign automakers are shipping more sport utility vehicles to the United States, while Honda and Toyota are preparing to build full-size sport utility vehicles in the Midwest. The foreign brands tend to be much more fuel efficient than the American brands because most of them are based on lightweight car bodies instead of the heavy pickup-truck underbodies that Detroit still uses. The market has been growing swiftly for small car-based sport utilities, which tend to be less polluting and more fuel efficient than bigger models and less dangerous to other motorists during crashes.</p>
        <p>During a question-and-answer session after Mr. Nasser's speech, which was delivered at the National Press Club here, he challenged Ford's rivals to match its decision to raise average fuel economy for sport utilities by 25 percent. ''If General Motors and Chrysler and others want to make that commitment -- that's a commitment; it's not words; it's a commitment -- then we'd welcome their inclusion in this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He later added that G.M. and Chrysler also had the technical capability for such an improvement.</p>
        <p>William Noack, a G.M. spokesman, said that General Motors models had better fuel economy than Ford models in many market segments, including full-size pickups, and that G.M. intended to keep that lead. But he added, ''I don't think we're going to be making any commitments, but we're going to make progress.''</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler declined to comment.</p>
