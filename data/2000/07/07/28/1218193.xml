        <p>ARTHUR LEVITT, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, wants to end his term by enacting new rules to increase the independence of auditors from their corporate clients.</p>
        <p>''This is,'' Mr. Levitt said near the end of a long day of public hearings, ''a cultural change we are talking about.''</p>
        <p>Auditors are the only profession enshrined in the nation's securities laws. If you want to sell stock to the public, you don't have to hire a lawyer or an investment banker, but you do need an independent accountant. Mr. Levitt fears that auditors are not sufficiently concerned with assuring that they are seen as independent.</p>
        <p>Many in the accounting industry bitterly resent Mr. Levitt's latest moves, which would force the accounting firms to stop providing some consulting services they now sell to companies whose books they audit. They say those services make them more familiar with the company, and thus able to do better audits. And, they say, there is no evidence that such relationships have led to bad audits.</p>
        <p>''Today the rules say we must be independent in fact,'' said James E. Copeland Jr., the chief executive of Deloitte &amp; Touche, in an interview. Mr. Levitt is pushing rules that demand ''independence in appearance,'' he said, adding that ''this Caesar's wife quote is absurd.'' That's the one that says some people must be above suspicion.</p>
        <p>There probably never was a golden age of accounting independence. Back in 1957, Leonard Spacek, the legendary managing partner of Arthur Andersen, was warning that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough independence. He complained that the accounting principle-setters of that era ''yielded quickly'' when companies complained that a new standard would cut their profits. ''Proper accounting principles in this case were not even discussed,'' he moaned. He warned that it was dangerous for auditors to be perceived as advocates for their clients, rather than impartial fact finders.</p>
        <p>Many things have changed for the better since then. The Financial Accounting Standards Board now sets accounting rules and has exhibited backbone.</p>
        <p>But accounting chief executives talk a different language than Spacek did. They are very confident that the public has confidence in them, and point to high stock prices as evidence that investors trust the financial statements they certify. To the extent there is a perception that they lack independence, they blame the S.E.C. for raising the issue. You get the impression everything would be fine if Mr. Levitt would just shut up or go away.</p>
        <p>Three of the major accounting firms -- Andersen, Deloitte and KPMG -- are determined to fight the new S.E.C. proposal. They are lining up allies in Congress and preparing to go to court. They hope to delay action until a new president can appoint a new S.E.C. chairman.</p>
        <p>They may win that fight. But such a victory would be pyrrhic. Highly publicized resistance to rules that are described as seeking to promote auditor independence will be remembered when -- as will surely happen -- there is another case of an audit gone awry, particularly if the auditing firm got far more money from consulting relationships than it did for doing the audit.</p>
        <p>The industry should seek a compromise, perhaps one that lets auditors continue to do more information-technology consulting than the S.E.C. seems to want, but with safeguards and fuller disclosures. But for now, there may be too much anger to allow such talks even to get under way.</p>
