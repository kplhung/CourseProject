        <p>Between games of a doubleheader yesterday, Pat Mahomes asked Mike Hampton if Hampton was going to pitch nine innings. Hampton, the Mets left-hander, said he would.</p>
        <p>''He was true to his word,'' Mahomes said.</p>
        <p>Mahomes had just thrown four and two-thirds innings, a season high for a Met reliever, but his effort had not prevented Manager Bobby Valentine from using three other relief pitchers to secure a 9-8 victory over the Montreal Expos in the first game.</p>
        <p>The Mets' bullpen needed a rest, and Hampton was the man to provide it. The Mets had lost both games he started on their recent road trip, but this was a dire situation, and that, Hampton's teammates have found, is when their No. 1 starter is at his best.</p>
        <p>''Mike's a big-game guy,'' Mahomes said. ''No matter what happens, it seems like every time there's a big game, he steps up and does a great job.''</p>
        <p>Hampton was outstanding yesterday, offering the Expos his usual assortment of sinkers down and away and cut fastballs down and in, to pitch the Mets to a 4-3 victory, completing a sweep.</p>
        <p>Hampton had allowed three runs (two earned) on five hits through eight innings. With rain coming down hard and Armando Benitez warming up in the bullpen, he fought through a difficult ninth inning to secure the complete game.</p>
        <p>''Once you get past the eighth,'' said Hampton, who walked only one, ''it doesn't really matter how tired you are. Adrenaline will push you another inning.''</p>
        <p>When Hampton knocked down a hard bouncer by Milton Bradley and threw to first for the game's final out -- three batters after a diving stop by Edgardo Alfonzo for the inning's first out -- it concluded a bizarre day at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>A nervous Grant Roberts was overwhelmed in his major league debut, lasting only one and one-third innings and giving up six earned runs on six hits and three walks. Right fielder Derek Bell left the first game when a ball smashed off his chin in right field, then returned for the second game with three stitches, only to be removed in the fifth inning when he felt light-headed and sick. Shortstop Melvin Mora left the first game when a ground ball struck his right index finger, cracking it open and causing him to miss the second game.</p>
        <p>The Mets and the Expos combined for nine errors that did not include two dropped pop-ups that were not scored errors. Third baseman Lenny Harris had three of those errors in the second game, but made up for it with a home run that took one hop and bounced over the back wall of the right-field bullpen.</p>
        <p>''For a minute I thought I was Robin Ventura, because I wasn't making any errors,'' said Harris, who had only one error as Ventura's replacement at third base before yesterday. ''Then I got back to reality.''</p>
        <p>The Mets are still waiting for Benny Agbayani to do the same. They continue to explore options for a more proven bat to put in the everyday lineup, and Agbayani does not know if he will still have a spot in the lineup or on the team after Monday's nonwaiver trading deadline. Meanwhile, he continues to produce, going 4 for 5 in the first game and singling in the Mets' three-run rally in the second inning of Game 2.</p>
        <p>Agbayani admitted the Mets were not optimistic coming in off the field after the top of the first inning of the first game. Roberts, who walked the first two hitters and allowed hits to three of the next four, had thrown 41 pitches in putting the Mets in a 4-0 hole. Bell, a .300 hitter, had left the game, and Mike Piazza was resting in the first game.</p>
        <p>''We were probably thinking, 'Aw, this is going to be a long day -- what a way to start a game off, like this,' '' Agbayani said. ''But you've got to play all nine innings to find out what's going to happen.''</p>
        <p>With two outs and the bases loaded in the first inning, Agbayani doubled to the base of the wall in left field, driving in two runs to cut the Expos' lead in half. Montreal went ahead by 7-2 in the second, but then Mahomes was on his way, blanking the Expos through the sixth. By the time Turk Wendell came on for the seventh, the Mets had closed to within one run of the lead.</p>
        <p>They tied it, then allowed the Expos to go ahead, 8-7. But with two outs in the eighth, Joe McEwing doubled, Alfonzo walked and Todd Zeile singled in the tying run. Facing the left-hander Steve Kline, the left-handed-batting Matt Franco rapped the go-ahead single to right, his third hit of the game.</p>
        <p>Valentine usually does not let Franco hit against left-handers; Franco was 0 for 7 against lefties last year and 1 for 6 this season. If the Mets had been trailing, Valentine said, he would have brought his only remaining position player, Piazza, off the bench. Catcher Todd Pratt then would have shifted to the outfield.</p>
        <p>But Valentine let Franco hit, and Franco rewarded him, stroking a 2-1 fastball to right for the decisive single.</p>
        <p>''I've always said that's one thing in baseball that's kind of overrated,'' Franco said. ''A guy like Randy Johnson's tough on lefties, but he's tough on everybody.''</p>
        <p>Franco was back on the bench for the second game, but the Mets still got most of their production from players not used to the spotlight. Alfonzo and Piazza were 0 for 10 in the doubleheader, but Agbayani, Harris and Jay Payton all had hits in both games.</p>
        <p>''We need the entire team to win as many games as we need to win,'' Valentine said. ''We've been relying heavily on Mike and Fonzie, and tonight it worked without their offensive contributions.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DEREK BELL had taken asprin between games of the doubleheader, BOBBY VALENTINE said, ''and it caught up with him.''</p>
        <p>PAT MAHOMES, who helped Bell off the field in the second game, said he did not think Bell had eaten much.</p>
        <p>''He just got a little woozy,'' Mahomes said. ''Derek will be in there tomorrow. I guarantee you.''</p>
