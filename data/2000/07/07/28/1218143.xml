        <p>The expression ''still as a statue'' won't apply to the works at Storm King Art Center tomorrow. With the help of Annette Lipson, some children and a little imagination, the pieces in this 500-acre sculpture park in Orange County will appear to move, vibrate, soar and even sing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lipson, a percussionist, ethnomusicologist and performance artist, will present ''The Eye, the Drum, the Earth and the Sky,'' an interactive program that will invite families to become part of what she calls ''a percussion parade.''</p>
        <p>''I set up percussion instruments around a group of sculptures, and I do something related, like a story or a poem or a song I've written, at each one,'' Ms. Lipson said.</p>
        <p>She plans to begin at Isamu Noguchi's ''Momo Taro,'' a sculpture based on ''The Peach Boy,'' a Japanese tale. She will probably also include ''Free Ride Home'' by Kenneth Snelson and ''The Iliad'' by Alexander Lieberman. At each point, her instruments will relate to the themes of the art, like Japanese percussion at the Noguchi work and a dumbek, or Greek drum, at ''The Iliad.''</p>
        <p>''The Snelson piece is made up of tubes that look as if they're balancing in midair,'' Ms. Lipson said. ''Kids can kind of run through it. So I set up metal percussion, and we do a lot of flying.''</p>
        <p>Athough she has written a full script for the event, she may improvise, depending on the ages of the children. Or, as she aptly put it, the route ''is not set in stone.''</p>
        <p>''The Eye, the Drum, the Earth and the Sky,'' tomorrow at 1 p.m. at Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, Extension 110. Free with admission: $7; the elderly, $5; students, $3; under 5, free.</p>
        <p>Whales and Tales</p>
        <p>Call them Ishmael. Or call them whatever you want. By any name children will qualify as amateur Melville scholars if they visit the South Street Seaport this weekend.</p>
        <p>There they can take part in the annual celebration of the birthday of Herman Melville, who loved literary voyages as much as ocean ones.</p>
        <p>''We think of him as a great writer, but he was also an avid reader and owned a huge library,'' said Cynthia Winslow, the seaport's coordinator of family and docent programs. ''During his travels, he brought his books with him.''</p>
        <p>Tomorrow and Sunday families can visit, at least in spirit, one of the places that inspired Melville: the South Seas. The Children's Center will offer folk tales from the Philippines and Polynesia, including ''How the Moon and Stars Came to Be,'' ''Why the Sky Is High'' and ''The Tale of the Boastful Star.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Winslow said Melville himself ''heard these tales and had amazing experiences,'' which led to his travel books ''Typee'' and ''Omoo.'' He also collected maritime prints; 46 of them are on view through Nov. 5 in the seaport's Melville Gallery at 213 Water Street.</p>
        <p>In addition to learning about Melville's genius, children can be creative themselves. Using stencils, glue and ''star dust'' (glitter), they will make maps of the constellations.</p>
        <p>''We're encouraging kids to make up their own story using the night sky,'' Ms. Winslow said.</p>
        <p>All weekend the seaport will collect new and used children's books for a local after-school program. The staff will waive the workshop materials fee for any family that donates a book -- a trade that Melville would no doubt have approved.</p>
        <p>''Melville's South Sea Adventures: Folk Tales From the South Seas,'' tomorrow and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. at the South Street Seaport Museum's Children's Center, 165 John Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8758. Free; materials fee, $2.</p>
        <p>Blue Eggs and Ham</p>
        <p>Most city children never have close encounters with chickens, except the ones on their dinner plates. On Sunday, however, they will be able to meet the birds undressed, as it were, along with their offspring, both hatched and unhatched.</p>
        <p>The opportunities are at Muscoot Farm, an early-1900's estate operated by Westchester County. Gigi Carnes, the curator, will show off the feathered friends, ranging in age from one year to less than one week.</p>
        <p>If the crowd is of manageable size, young visitors may even be able to touch the chicks gently, ''with one finger on the back of the neck,'' said Sue Moga, the farm's manager.</p>
        <p>While the children may not resolve which came first, the chicken or the egg, they will certainly learn how to tell which egg came from which species. The farm's staff will help them compare chicken eggs with those from other residents, like ducks, turkeys and geese. The children will then play a matching game with a box filled with eggs. The clues are color and size, although bigger birds don't necessarily lay larger eggs.</p>
        <p>''One type of duck lays blue eggs,'' Ms. Moga said. ''We've had goose eggs that are bigger than turkeys' but goose eggs are usually white and turkeys' are usually speckled.''</p>
        <p>Children will also match feathers to birds and experiment with grading eggs, using a scale. (The final determinant is weight, not size.) And so the young naturalists won't forget what they've learned, they will be invited to color and put together a life cycle chart for chickens.</p>
        <p>Families can also visit pigs, horses, ponies and lambs. If the weather is good, the farm will offer tractor-led hayrides, which may provide glimpses of some wild creatures, too.</p>
        <p>''Meet the Chicks,'' Sunday from noon to 3 p.m. at Muscoot Farm, Route 100, Somers, N.Y., (914) 232-7118. Admission and parking: free.</p>
