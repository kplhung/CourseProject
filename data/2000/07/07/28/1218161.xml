        <p>Mongolia, the land of Genghis Khan, windswept steppes and tough ponies, is seldom associated with religious art. Yet such art always thrived there, in the form of gilded Buddhist icons and in the expressive images of a native shamanism.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of that work has vanished. Buddhism worked hard for centuries to put shamanism out of business, and to a large degree succeeded. In the 1930's, Stalinist purges destroyed practically all of the Buddhist monasteries -- more than 700 -- along with everything in them.</p>
        <p>Some precious objects were hidden away and have since reappeared in the national museum collections of an independent Mongolia. And in 1995, a remarkable cache of this material visited the United States in an exhibition that was put together by the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and traveled to the Denver Art Museum and the National Geographic Society in Washington.</p>
        <p>The installation in Washington, in a choppy string of lobby galleries, was something of a bust. But much of the art, sacred and secular and mostly dating from the late 19th and 20th centuries, was spectacular. And nothing made a stronger impression than a handful of sculptural masks, larger than life, vividly painted and made to be worn in epic-scale religious dramas.</p>
        <p>Some of the outstanding masks from that show, along with others visiting America for the first time, are at Asia House in ''Dancing Demons: Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia,'' an exhibition that is itself a slice of a larger Mongolian survey organized by the art historian Jan Fontein at the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam last year.</p>
        <p>With Asia Society in temporary quarters these days -- its main plant, farther north on Park Avenue, is under renovation -- its gallery space is tight, and Mr. Fontein had to edit his original show down. No harm done. The result is a usefully focused look at one aspect of a complex hybrid culture in which Buddhism and shamanism alternately duked it out and worked together.</p>
        <p>Asian shamanism remains little studied in the West, particularly in exhibitions. But in Mongolia, as in Tibet, it was the primary religion of a nomadic people who viewed the natural world as a cosmic mechanism of checks and balances, controlled by ancestral spirits, sensitive to disturbance, always threatening to tip toward disaster. By means of ritual implements and trance-induced visions, shamans intervened in crises and appealed to the powers that be for relief.</p>
        <p>If shamanism was a grass-roots religion, Buddhism was a movable feast. Wherever it touched down outside its birthplace in India, it was an import item, a foreign body that aroused suspicion as well as devotion. Perhaps for this reason it learned to be diplomatic about making its presence felt. Rather than replace local religious traditions outright, it borrowed from them, then gradually absorbed them in a passive-aggressive mix of preservation and suppression.</p>
        <p>But traditions are traditions for a reason. They're tenacious and resilient, and even when paved over, they keep pushing up, blending into the new order here, standing out from it there. And that is the organic story -- it's the ABC of cultural history -- told in the objects at Asia Society.</p>
        <p>True, some of those objects seem, at least at a glance, religiously specific, like the 19th-century shaman costumes on loan from the National Museum of Mongolian History or items made for a New Year celebration honoring the Buddha of the future, Maitreya. For that occasion, a statue of Maitreya was displayed on a wooden chariot to which the head of a magical green horse was attached. Such a head, a velvet-covered wood carving attributed to the artist-monk Damdinsuren (1868-1938), is in the show.</p>
        <p>But the horse was an emblem important to Buddhism and shamanism alike. And both religions were thoroughly intertwined in another grand monastic festival known as the Tsam. A combination of morality play, circus, shoot-em-up action film and public exorcism, it involved an eclectic cast of symbolic characters, with the god of death -- the Buddhist Yama, the shamanist Erlik Khan -- in the starring role.</p>
        <p>The event was staged in a mandala pattern. The outdoor playing area was divided into a series of concentric circles, at the center of which stood a doll-like form molded from a lump of fast-rising dough. Throughout the long performance, characters attacked the doll with knives, and its yeasty form slowly swelled as if poisoned. (Symbolically, it was absorbing evil, including sins of the community.) In the end, it was hacked to pieces and burned, leaving the path to collective enlightenment clear.</p>
        <p>All of the roles in the pageant were acted by monks wearing elaborate masks of the kind seen at Asia Society. A pair of skeletal figures called Citipati, with sources in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, opened the proceedings with a shivery flourish. They were followed by the pudgy, grinning Kashin Kahn and his eight sons, characters with complicated links to Chinese Buddhism, who served as both orchestra and receiving line, greeting new players as they arrived.</p>
        <p>Shamanist figures joined the festivities at various points. Some were powerfully exotic: a mask of the Hindu deity Garuda, a horned bird carrying a cotton serpent in its beak, embodied the spirit of a revered holy man from the past who had ''converted'' to Buddhism. The main shaman character, however, named the White Old Man, was a burlesque, a doddering, bearded buffoon. Intended to provide comic relief, he was relegated to the fringes of the central activity. But, significantly, he was an audience favorite.</p>
        <p>As in many dramas, the villains were the most dynamic figures of all, and although Yama/Erlik Khan is not directly represented in the exhibition, several of his frightful henchmen are, among them the ghoulish Citipati and a dancing deer with a lolling red velvet tongue. Also on hand are snarling, bug-eyed characters known as dharmapalas, or protectors of the Buddhist law. Indebted, like so much Mongolian art, to Tibetan prototypes, they look demonic but are actually agents of divine protection, meant to scare evil away.</p>
        <p>The show is fleshed out with interesting smaller items. One, a brocade ritual apron stitched with the face of the Buddhist god Mahakala, represents a kind of pictorial applique at which Mongolian artists excelled. Another is a two-stringed violin, its slender neck ending with green-painted horse heads, which was designed to accompany recitations of heroic Mongolian tales passed on through oral tradition.</p>
        <p>The exhibition catalog -- a more modest effort by far, at least in its English version, than the one produced by the Asian Art Museum -- suggests that such recitations are still occasionally performed. And apparently, the grand festivals are being revived, and art surviving in museums and monasteries is being restored.</p>
        <p>It would certainly be good to see more of this work, including the glorious sculptures of the renowned artist-lama Zanabazar (1635-1723), in New York, where enthusiasm for things Buddhist runs high and cultural hybridity is well understood. Perhaps ''Dancing Demons'' will inspire one of the big museums to get into the festive groove.</p>
        <p>''Dancing Demons: Ceremonial Masks of Mongolia'' remains at the Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, through Sept. 17.</p>
