        <p>From Senate Race To Horse Race</p>
        <p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON'S day at the races in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., yesterday sounded like something out of a Marx Brothers movie: Mrs. Clinton had the winner in the eighth race. She also had all the losers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that someone had bet on every horse to win in the eighth race and had given her the tickets. So she was cheering when Babae finished in 1:48.64, paying $6 on a $2 bet.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said she also had a $2 bet on a horse named Dictator Rudy in the seventh. Dictator Rudy came in last. Mrs. Clinton's opponent, until he dropped out of the campaign for the United States Senate in May, was MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI.</p>
        <p>The Associated Press said that Mrs. Clinton spent almost an hour at the track with leaders of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. before heading into the clubhouse for the last two races of the day.</p>
        <p>Behind the scenes, Mrs. Clinton's campaign is starting to look like the campaign that sent CHARLES E. SCHUMER to the Senate in 1998. KATHIE LEVINE, who was Mr. Schumer's press secretary during the campaign and followed him to Washington, is joining Mrs. Clinton's campaign as press secretary. HOWARD WOLFSON, Mrs. Clinton's communications director, had the same title in the Schumer campaign.</p>
        <p>Has it been two years since the Schumer campaign? ''I feel like it's five,'' Ms. Levine said. ''Try living in Washington.'' Having done that, she said that she did not plan to go back after November.</p>
        <p>Sentimental Site For a Serial Killer</p>
        <p>MATT BLANK, the chairman and chief executive of Showtime Networks, dropped into St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Harlem recently to watch the shooting of ''3 A.M.,'' a film about a serial killer who preys on cabdrivers. Behind the camera was LEE DAVIS, a first-time director (he has been an assistant director for SPIKE LEE'S 40 Acres and a Mule production company) who also wrote the script.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis told him, Mr. Blank said, that, ''My parents were married in this church and I was confirmed in this church.''.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Davis yelled ''Action.''</p>
        <p>''DANNY GLOVER and PAM GRIER, the first time they'd ever worked together, they went straight to a passionate kissing scene,'' Mr. Blank said. ''Lee had to yell 'cut' about three times until they heard him.''</p>
        <p>A pause.</p>
        <p>''I don't want you to think I'm a typical suit who's putting his nose in the movie,'' Mr. Blank said. ''My kids want to put their nose in the movie.'' Many of the films Showtime carries are made in Canada, he explained, making it hard for GORDY, 12, and MEREDITH, 15, to line up a trip to the set.</p>
        <p>Closing Notice, But Whose?</p>
        <p>Cast members from the long-running Off Broadway show ''Stomp'' -- the percussion extravaganza that began with a troupe of buskers,  entertaining on street corners -- wondered if they were going back to the streets on Wednesday. ''Stomp'' has been playing at the Orpheum Theater, at 126 Second Avenue, since 1993. But on Wednesday, word began spreading that stickers reading ''must close September 10'' had been pasted across posters for the show in the Times Square subway station.</p>
        <p>''My roommate was on the subway, and she gave me a call: 'Your show is closing,' '' said HENRY SHEAD, a cast member. ''You never know in show business what's going to go on. I called the office and said, 'Are you guys closing and not telling anybody?' They swore to me it's not closing.''</p>
        <p>It did not take Mr. Shead -- or JOE WATSON, the general manager of ''Stomp'' -- long to figure out what had happened. ''I said, 'I bet it got mixed up with 'Cats,' '' Mr. Shead said. The ''Stomp'' posters were next to posters for ''Cats,'' the long-running musical whose slogan used to be ''now and forever.'' Its closing was announced this year, and postponed twice.</p>
        <p>Why the mix-up? Did a poster-hanger not notice that he was slapping the ''must close September 10'' sticker on the poster for the wrong one-syllable show? A woman who answered the telephone at T.D.I., the company responsible for advertising in subway stations, said no one was available to talk about the mix-up. But Mr. Shead said there had been one benefit for ''Stomp'': ''It has been sold out ever since.''</p>
