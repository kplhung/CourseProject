        <p>The House today passed legislation that would reduce taxes on some Social Security benefits, giving Republicans another victory in their effort to make tax cuts a defining election-year issue.</p>
        <p>The vote was 265 to 159. Fifty-two Democrats broke ranks to support the bill, which President Clinton said he would veto.</p>
        <p>The bill would roll back a tax imposed in 1993, at Mr. Clinton's behest, on part of the benefits received by the one-fifth of Social Security recipients with the highest incomes.</p>
        <p>The Senate voted earlier this month to approve a similar measure as an amendment to another bill but later stripped out the amendment for procedural reasons. Republicans said they hoped to bring it up again.</p>
        <p>It was the final major piece in a series of tax cuts brought up this year by Republicans, who have succeeded in attracting considerable support for the bills from Democrats in Congress even as Mr. Clinton has vowed to keep them from becoming law. They include tax cuts for married couples, repeal of the federal estate tax and expansion of retirement savings programs.</p>
        <p>The vote today came as Republicans prepared for the opening of their national convention on Monday in Philadelphia. Republicans plan to use the convention to press their case that voters will not see any substantial tax cuts, despite the large and growing federal budget surplus, until a Republican is in the White House.</p>
        <p>''We're saying these are good, common sense tax cuts for the American people, they ought to be signed, there's no excuse,'' said the speaker of the House, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Clinton pressed his case that Republicans were frittering away the projected budget surplus on tax cuts without addressing other long-term problems including the solvency of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed that the Republican Congress continues to strip away our fiscal discipline bill by bill by passing another in a series of costly tax cuts that, taken together, will spend our entire hard-earned surplus,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by the House today would repeal an element of the budget deficit-reduction plan pushed through Congress by Mr. Clinton in 1993 without support from a single Republican.</p>
        <p>The 1993 measure increased to 85 percent, from 50 percent, the part of Social Security benefits subject to income tax when a recipient's income, including half the annual Social Security benefit, exceeds certain levels. Those levels are $34,000 for a single person and $44,000 for a married couple.</p>
        <p>The tax revenue generated by the 1993 measure -- about $8 billion this year and rising fast -- is earmarked only for Medicare. It is projected to double over the next decade.</p>
        <p>The bill passed today would reduce the taxable portion of the benefit back to 50 percent, the level agreed on by President Ronald Reagan and Congress in 1983, when they first imposed a tax on Social Security. The 50 percent level applies starting at lower income thresholds than the 85 percent level -- $25,000 for a single person and $32,000 for a couple.</p>
        <p>If enacted, the change would reduce federal revenues by $117 billion over the next decade. The bill would provide for the same amount of money to be channeled into Medicare out of general tax revenues, thereby, leaving Medicare unharmed by the change, Republicans said.</p>
        <p>Although it would only affect relatively well off beneficiaries, the issue has considerable political sensitivity. Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the 1993 measure, and Republicans linked him to it throughout the day of debate on the House floor today.</p>
        <p>Facing attacks from Democrats over their proposals to create private investment accounts within the retirement system, Republicans also saw the bill as a way to attract support from older voters, who polls show tend to be leery of tinkering with Social Security. The bill also proved attractive to Democrats who have large numbers of elderly voters in their districts and those who were always uncomfortable levying a tax on Social Security.</p>
        <p>Republicans said that since the additional levy on Social Security had been imposed in 1993 to help eliminate the budget deficit, it should be repealed now that the deficit has given way to a substantial surplus. Moreover, they said, it was wrong to tax retirees on benefits they had spent a lifetime earning.</p>
        <p>Democrats said the bill would help those retired people who needed help the least.</p>
        <p>KEEPING TRACK  The Republican Tax Agenda</p>
        <p>MARRIED COUPLES -- Packaged as an effort to reduce the marriage penalty on two-income couples, it would give a tax break to nearly all couples, totaling $292 billion over 10 years. Has passed both houses of Congress and was sent yesterday to President Clinton, who has said he will veto it.</p>
        <p>ESTATE TAX -- Would gradually repeal the federal estate tax, reducing revenues by $100 billion over the next decade and $750 billion in the second decade after it is fully phased in. Intended in part to help family-owned farms and businesses, its benefits would go to the 2 percent of estates with the highest values. Passed the House and Senate, but faces a veto.</p>
        <p>SOCIAL SECURITY TAX -- Would roll back a tax increase imposed in 1993 on some Social Security beneficiaries. Would return to 50 percent, from 85 percent, the maximum amount of a benefit subject to income tax. Would reduce revenues by $117 billion over 10 years. Passed yesterday by the House. Senate is likely to take up similar measure. The president has said he will veto it.</p>
        <p>SOCIAL SECURITY EARNINGS -- Removed the limit on how much Social Security recipients could earn starting at age 65 without losing part of their benefit. Passed by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>RETIREMENT SAVINGS -- Would expand maximum allowable contributions to individual retirement accounts to $5,000 from $2,000 and raise the limit on employee contributions to 401(k) plans to $15,000 from $10,500. Would reduce revenues by $52 billion over 10 years. Passed the House. Senate will take up a similar measure in September. Opposed by the White House.</p>
        <p>TELEPHONE TAX -- Would remove a 3 percent federal excise tax on telephone service. Would reduce revenues by $55 billion over 10 years. Passed the House. Has strong support in the Senate. The administration has not opposed the bill.</p>
