        <p>IN two months, nobody will remember this weird game except for Grant Roberts. Played partly in a soft mist, the game will recede into the mists of memory except for the kid pitcher who made his major league debut, quickly and erratically.</p>
        <p>Whatever ultimately happens with the Mets this season, they will obsess on games in late September, when every hit, every error, will receive, by definition, bonus frequent-flyer miles of terror. By then, even the Mets' players will probably have forgotten yesterday's noon game in the odd Walesian chill of July.</p>

        <p>IN two months, nobody will remember this weird game except for Grant Roberts. Played partly in a soft mist, the game will recede into the mists of memory except for the kid pitcher who made his major league debut, quickly and erratically.</p>
        <p>Whatever ultimately happens with the Mets this season, they will obsess on games in late September, when every hit, every error, will receive, by definition, bonus frequent-flyer miles of terror. By then, even the Mets' players will probably have forgotten yesterday's noon game in the odd Walesian chill of July.</p>
        <p>Players kept leaving the field with blood dripping from them. Four different Mets wound up patrolling right field. And somehow the Mets managed to come back to win, 9-8, in the first game of a doubleheader, and they won the second game, too, 4-3.</p>
        <p>The most vivid memories of the first game will belong to Roberts, age 22, who was called up to start because the Mets were in a pitching crunch. His term with the club was scheduled to be about as short as it could get: one game, in and out.</p>
        <p>This is his sixth season in professional baseball. A 5-5 won-lost record this year makes him something less than a pheenom. But the Mets needed some innings, so here he was.</p>
        <p>Roberts arrived in New York at 12:30 a.m. yesterday. By his own admission, he ''didn't sleep too well.'' Asked to be more specific, he said, ''Just about minutes.''</p>
        <p>Somebody had left him a note telling him to report to Shea Stadium at 9 a.m., which was fine with him, considering he wasn't sleeping anyway. When he got to the clubhouse, nobody was there. Wednesday's drenching rain had canceled a pregame practice, so he had some more quality time by himself.</p>
        <p>By noon, the majority of the patrons were day campers, clusters of blue T-shirts and green T-shirts and yellow T-shirts, who had arrived on clunky yellow school buses. The campers were far less likely to shower venom on any errant Mets than the firewater-fueled alleged adults on your normal, rabid night game.</p>
        <p>Still, it was the big leagues. In his warm-ups, Roberts got the impression the mound was somehow flatter than the one at Norfolk. For whatever reason, Roberts walked the first batter, and then he walked the second batter. Then he saw Bobby Valentine, the manager, trotting out for a chat.</p>
        <p>Roberts did not know Valentine rarely visits the mound, preferring to leave those machinations to his pitching coach. But Valentine said Dave Wallace, the coach, had informed him that ''he had done everything he could in the bullpen,'' so Valentine felt it was incumbent on him to try to soothe the young pitcher.</p>
        <p>''He told me I looked real good in my uniform,'' Roberts recalled later, a bemused smirk indicating he knew Valentine had made a nice try.</p>
        <p>Valentine also told Roberts that the mound was fine. The manager did a lot of gesticulating, as if the two of them were sitting around a coffee bar debating the meaning of life.</p>
        <p>''Whatever it was, it didn't work,'' Valentine admitted later.</p>
        <p>Now came the carnage. The third batter whacked a hard single that bounced off the wet grass and hit a hydroplaning Derek Bell smack on the chin, drawing blood. Bell trudged out of the game via the bullpen. Bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Guerrero, batting a mere .355, lashed a line drive to third, but Jose Vidro, hitting a sizzling .358, cleared the bases with a double. By the time the young man left in the second inning, he would hold an earned run average of 40.50 for his major league career, all four outs of it. ''Maybe I was choking the ball,'' Roberts conceded later.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, he had plenty of company in the clubhouse. There was Bell with three new stitches in his chin. Soon there was also Melvin Mora, out of the game with blood dripping from a split nail on his throwing hand.</p>
        <p>The Mets were down, 7-2, and a few players told Roberts to pay attention, that they were going to win this game. He was not about to dispute them. When they tied the score, the players told Roberts that he had ''slipped the big tuna hook, that I wasn't just a little trout.''</p>
        <p>''I probably deserved an 'L,' '' Roberts said, referring to a loss. ''But I'm glad the team won.''</p>
        <p>After the first game, Roberts was ready to go back to Norfolk. The Mets were activating their utility infielder Kurt Abbott and needed a space on the roster. ''I don't think they saw the real Grant Roberts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If he is back here in September, the campers will be in school and the games will seem so much more vital.</p>
