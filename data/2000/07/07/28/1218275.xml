        <p>Pat Hearn Gallery  530 West 22nd Street  Chelsea  Through Monday</p>
        <p>This smart little pipe dream of a photo-and-video show, organized by Daniel Reich, mixes visual fantasy and social history in just the right proportions. And its mood is set by some two dozen photographs, taken by Sheyla Baykal in the early 1970's, of the all-male performing group known as the Angels of Light.</p>
        <p>The Angels were the brainchild of George Harris (a k a Hibiscus), who also founded the Cockettes and who died of AIDS in 1982. Based in San Francisco and New York, they were an inspired blend of Flower Power extravagance and highly evolved gay consciousness -- pre-clone, pro-sissy -- with roots in an anarchic theater style of subterranean luminaries like John Vaccaro and the great, mad Jack Smith.</p>
        <p>The performers wore hand-stitched gowns of scintillating splendor and covered their faces (including beards, in vogue at the time) with encrustations of glitter. The result, way beyond unisex, was an out-of-this-world body art, a cross between Byzantine liturgy and Hollywood costume epic. Its absurdist magnificence has a real glow in the engaged photographs of Ms. Baykal, who was herself a vital fringe figure. A model turned photographer, a friend of many artists, including Peter Hujar and Paul Thek, she was on the front lines of alternative-everything in the 1970's, along with her camera. She died of cancer in 1997 at 53. Her work deserves to be better known.</p>
        <p>The photography in the show from this point on is of more recent date, but it operates somewhere within the range of trippy, self-amused, star-obsessed narcissism that the Angels represented. Alex Bag offers portraits of the artist Patterson Beckwith done up as David Bowie, whose 1973 Ziggy Stardust persona was inspired by Vaccaroesque theater. Both artists also collaborate on some glamorously wasted photographic tableaus that look like sendups of Nan Goldin.</p>
        <p>Jimmy De Sana wears light-catching aluminum foil in his hair for a pair of psychedelic self-portraits. Jack Pierson contributes a fetishistic wall piece made up of 60 head shots, some of them stained and distressed, of a single handsome young man. The pop singer Bjork looks, with her intense eye shadow, distinctly Angelic in pictures by David Sims. The young Japanese-born artist Hiroshi Sunairi ornaments a pouty, album-coverish 1997 self-portrait with flourishes of hippie-era script.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sunairi has also produced one of the show's three videos: in it, he and a friend named Yuki take turns giving each other what appear to be mind-altering haircuts. Tam Ochiai transforms footage of a fashion model being made up into a pulsating orange-and-purple light show.</p>
        <p>Wildest of all is ''Three Tales,'' a 1977 piece by Joan Jonas, in which elfish adults and spritely children swathed in fantastic robes march like extraterrestrial guerrilla troops through an unearthly landscape. A narrative is never quite spelled out, but the characters have a commanding grace that confirms, like much else in Mr. Reich's pixilated show, that radical fairies rule.</p>
