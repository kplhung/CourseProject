        <p>Mike Barrow, who came to the Giants as a free agent from the Carolina Panthers, knew his former teammates Rae Carruth and Fred Lane well enough to be worried about the paths their lives were taking. Today, Barrow said he had tried on several occasions to counsel them.</p>
        <p>''I saw the things they were doing,'' Barrow, the Giants' new middle linebacker, said. ''I saw me in them and I tried to help. They were young and they were kind of lost. They needed a support group, someone to guide them. You try to reach out to people like that. You can see it.''</p>

        <p>Mike Barrow, who came to the Giants as a free agent from the Carolina Panthers, knew his former teammates Rae Carruth and Fred Lane well enough to be worried about the paths their lives were taking. Today, Barrow said he had tried on several occasions to counsel them.</p>
        <p>''I saw the things they were doing,'' Barrow, the Giants' new middle linebacker, said. ''I saw me in them and I tried to help. They were young and they were kind of lost. They needed a support group, someone to guide them. You try to reach out to people like that. You can see it.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Carruth was charged with murdering his former girlfriend, who was pregnant with Carruth's child. This month, Lane was shot to death by his wife in what police described as a domestic dispute.</p>
        <p>''I'm crying inside about what happened to Rae and what happened to Fred,'' Barrow said. ''I had tried to share some of my experiences with them because I thought it might help. There was a time in my life when I was dealing with a lot of women myself. I said: 'Rae, that ain't cool.' ''</p>
        <p>Barrow said his decision in 1998 to practice his Christian faith devoutly changed him, and he has maintained contact with Carruth through Carruth's mother.</p>
        <p>''She called me and asked if I could get a pastor to visit Rae in jail,'' Barrow said of Carruth, whose murder trial, along with three co-defendants, won't begin until next year. ''We're all just praying that the truth will come out. There are a lot of conflicting stories and the only one who knows the truth is the woman who died. We're just praying, praying for the truth.''</p>
        <p>Carruth was charged with first degree murder along with three others in the death of Cherica Adams, who was shot three times in the back and once in the shoulder while driving her car. Barrow said he was at a Christian conference in the Bahamas, a gathering aimed at teaching athletes how to minister to other athletes, when he heard that Lane had been shot to death by his 25-year-old wife, Deidra, in their Charlotte home on July 6. The police said the shooting followed an argument.</p>
        <p>''I said. 'What?' '' Barrow said. ''And the news just echoed through the place. We all said it: 'We've got to get these younger guys help.' ''</p>
        <p>Stretching in the grass after today's practice, Barrow, 30, said he saw Carruth, the Panthers' top draft pick in 1997, and Lane, Carolina's career rushing leader, stumble in ways that were familiar to him.</p>
        <p>''You get young guys, they're suddenly big stars and people treat you like you're the Godfather,'' Barrow said. ''People come and tell you you're wonderful and come to you for money and to settle their problems. And they treat you like you have no problems. They tell you all kinds of things about how good you have it. And you lose your mind. You don't know who you are and yet you're a prisoner of yourself. If you don't have a base, a support group that loves you for who you are, you have trouble.''</p>
        <p>Asked if there was anything about the Charlotte area, where the Panthers are based, that contributed to the tragedies that enveloped Carruth and Lane, Barrow said: ''I love the place. It's where I plan to live. It's a great place to raise a family. A single person, if he doesn't have any family and friends, he's going to be bored.</p>
        <p>''You put these young guys who might have just come from a wild college town atmosphere down there, they might not be used to it.''</p>
        <p>Barrow was also witness to some of the difficulties Kerry Collins experienced with the Panthers.</p>
        <p>''Kerry's problems were bigger than football,'' Barrow said. ''I was worried about him as a person. Before I signed with the Giants, we got together and Kerry was much more grounded. He talked to me about the changes in his life, how he admitted he had a problem, and I was so happy for him.''</p>
        <p>On the subject of Carruth and Lane, Barrow remained far more somber.</p>
        <p>''You know, they came to church with us,'' Barrow said, referring to himself and his wife, Shelley. ''It was an awesome time. It was great. Fred was the greatest guy. Marriage is tough. Fred just needed someone to talk to. We all do. That's what hurts. It still fills me with pain.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Defensive end MICHAEL STRAHAN did not practice Thursday because his back tightened, Coach JIM FASSEL said. The Giants, who are already thin at defensive end, may have to start looking at the second-round draft pick CORNELIUS GRIFFIN, who was drafted as a tackle, at defensive end. JOMO COUSINS, a free agent and second-year player, played with the first unit today in Strahan's absence.</p>
        <p>Running back JOE MONTGOMERY left practice with a cut lip. The Giants will hold an intrasquad scrimmage Saturday at 2 p.m. at their training camp at the State University at Albany. The Giants had four game officials working during practice. They mostly called pass-interference penalties on the secondary. Although he is not facing a real pass rush because the quarterback is not allowed to be hit in training camp, quarterback KERRY COLLINS nonetheless looks very sharp, throwing the ball with accuracy and extraordinary timing, especially to wide receivers AMANI TOOMER and IKE HILLIARD. JOE JUREVICIUS, the third receiver, has also continued to have a strong camp.</p>
