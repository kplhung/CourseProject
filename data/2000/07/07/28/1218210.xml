        <p>Here's an adage for the Internet age: New technology has a way of making itself indispensable -- even to those who are at first wary of it.</p>
        <p>This will be true even for the big music labels, which won an important  battle against Napster, an online music bazaar that allows computer users to exchange music without paying a penny for the privilege.</p>
        <p>This week, the music companies are naturally gratified that a federal district judge has ruled that Napster violated copyright law and has ordered the online service to stop permitting the exchange of music, effectively shutting it down.</p>
        <p>In the industry's mind, its music and its artists have been protected from digital piracy. But a year or two down the road, these same companies may find that some comparable online service could be their indispensable friend.</p>
        <p>Nearly 100 years ago, music publishers filed a copyright lawsuit to stop the manufacture of piano rolls, on the ground that they would undercut sales of sheet music. The publishers lost their case in the Supreme Court but soon got Congress to amend the copyright act in their favor, requiring manufacturers of music rolls, as well as the newly popular phonograph records, to pay lucrative royalty fees.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later, when radio stations broadcast musical works without paying royalties, the publishers sued again. The stations contended that their broadcasts were free and, in any case, increased the sales of sheet music -- virtually the same arguments Napster made two weeks ago in Senate hearings, when it claimed that its service was free and that it boosted record companies' sales. As in the case of Napster, the argument of the radio stations did not succeed in court. Because of this, radio stations today pay to broadcast music -- and music publishers and record companies depend on these stations to promote their products.</p>
        <p>Almost every confrontation between the entertainment industry and new technology ends in the same way: four or five years after the litigation and legislation end, the new technology -- once the industry's fearsome enemy -- becomes its staunchest ally. Indeed, the technology ends up generating abundant new revenue for the owners of copyrights.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon is not confined to music. In the late 1970's, motion picture companies sued to stop the sale of VCR's, arguing that the industry lost money anytime viewers copied movies from television broadcasts. Also, in the early 80's, the movie companies went to Congress to ask for legislation requiring video stores to pay a royalty each time they rented a cassette. The companies lost in court and in Congress. Yet, without either of the legal rights they sought, the industry developed a fresh source of revenue through the expanded sale of videocassettes.</p>
        <p>According to Napster's lawyer, the company could be forced to shut down if it loses its appeal. Napster may no longer exist, but the technology will likely live on and thrive on the Internet. It's not hard to see how music companies could benefit from online services. Already, some companies are licensed to distribute music on the Web. With modest levels of encryption and reasonable pricing, music companies could make hundreds of millions of dollars by offering their products online.</p>
        <p>In the end, music companies will adapt to these new services. The industry may be able to shut down Napster, but it can't stop the advance of technology.</p>
