        <p>By the end of last year's magical football season at Virginia Tech and well into this spring, Michael Vick could no longer walk into the Wal-Mart in Blacksburg, Va., without being followed down every aisle.</p>
        <p>He had escaped sports agents hounding him only to run into avid Hokie fans, in canned goods or in electronics, asking him for autographs or simply trying to get a glimpse of the 6-foot-1-inch, 214-pound left-handed quarterback.</p>
        <p>After eight months in the fishbowl he built for himself as a freshman by directing Virginia Tech to an 11-1 season, which ended with a loss to Florida State in the national championship game, Vick spun away from the attention.</p>
        <p>Vick was the one hanging the gone fishin' sign, the one returning home to Newport News, Va., this summer.</p>
        <p>Vick took his rod and reel to the pier, waiting with his buddies for the bass to bite. ''I've been staying low key, doing the things I like to do,'' he said today at the Big East Conference's football media day at Giants Stadium. ''I was just tired, just drained. I needed to get away.''</p>
        <p>About this time last year, he was a little-known quarterback who had redshirted his first year in college to study the system. Then, despite playing only 10 regular-season games, Vick led the nation in passing efficiency, throwing for 1,840 yards, 12 touchdowns and 5 interceptions, while rushing for 585 yards and 8 touchdowns. The Big East rookie of the year, he finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting; Vick will enter the 2000 college football season as the top returning Heisman candidate. His combination of speed, arm strength and field savvy baffles his teammates, even himself at times, and has his competitors cheering for him.</p>
        <p>''Michael Vick is the man,'' said Damione Lewis, the University of Miami's senior defensive tackle. In a news media poll today, the Hurricanes were voted to win the Big East, just ahead of Virginia Tech. While Miami is off probation and can contend for the national title, the buzz today was more about Vick than the Hurricanes.</p>
        <p>''When you're talking about the Big East Conference, you cannot talk about it without naming Michael Vick first,'' Lewis said. ''That's O.K. with me.''</p>
        <p>Vick's Sugar Bowl performance was stunning. He totaled 322 yards of offense and helped to wipe out a 14-point halftime deficit by igniting a 15-point third quarter. The Hokies lost, 46-29, but Vick revealed his gift for the game.</p>
        <p>''Michael just captured people's imagination last year and he did it on a national stage,'' Mike Tranghese, the Big East commissioner, said. ''I've probably been asked more pure football questions about Michael Vick than any player since this league has started.''</p>
        <p>The day after the Sugar Bowl, Virginia Tech Coach Frank Beamer was in Houston doing a radio show. ''I thought, 'Florida State just won the national championship last night and all people want to call in and talk about is Michael Vick.' '' Beamer recalled. ''It hit me that he did just show the whole country something that we kind of take for granted.''</p>
        <p>Executives from one professional sport did not. Vick's national title game persuaded the Colorado Rockies to select him in the 30th round of the baseball draft last month. They did not care that he had not played baseball since the seventh grade.</p>
        <p>''I didn't really believe it when I heard it,'' Vick said. ''I thought about it for a second, talked it over with my mom. I thanked them, but told them that football was my first priority.''</p>
        <p>Vick is now the point man for the football renaissance of the Big East, a conference of eight that could send five teams to bowl games this season, its 10th, Tranghese said today.</p>
        <p>Vick could have been playing for another Big East power. Coach Paul Pasqualoni of Syracuse, who nearly persuaded Vick to go there, could only shake his head, just like the tacklers who miss Vick.</p>
        <p>''Michael Vick,'' he said, ''is probably the best quarterback in America. There's not a team at any level that's got an answer to him.''</p>
        <p>Asked to splice his top three Vick moments for his highlight film, Beamer chose his favorite from the 62-0 rout against Syracuse.</p>
        <p>''He dropped back, a guy comes in and thought he had him, he jukes him, moves to his right and throws a 40-yard tight ball to Davis and hits him on the dead run,'' he said, referring to Andre Davis. ''That says it all. The first guy had him, he didn't get him, and all of a sudden he throws an almost impossible ball right on the money.''</p>
        <p>Pasqualoni winced at the memory.  ''He can hurt you when the play doesn't break down,'' he said. ''He is really something when the play does break down.''</p>
        <p>Coaches have learned not to focus on Vick's scrambling ability, but his arm, as well. ''You should watch him throw in practice,'' his teammate Nick Sorenson, a linebacker, said. ''I haven't seen an arm that strong, that quick, and someone that fast. And it's all on one person.''</p>
        <p>Last year, in the preseason, Vick ran a 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds. This year he ran it in 4.25, the first overture to his encore.</p>
        <p>''People talk about that sophomore jinx, but there's no question in my mind,'' Beamer said. ''He'll make better decisions. He'll have the experience, the maturity, the pass reads to get the ball where it needs to go quicker.''</p>
        <p>But the Sugar Bowl made Vick realize something about his game: ''I could barely move the next morning. I can't be taking all that punishment or I probably won't be there to see the next level. I won't limit my running, but I'll be smarter. Expect me to get a lot of my teammates involved in the passing game. It's not just going to be me.''</p>
        <p>Vick says he has thought about leaving school early for the National Football League draft, especially if he were to win the Heisman or a national title. But for now he is concentrating on this season, while Virginia Tech is trying to limit the media blitz and his appearances. The university launched a Web site for Vick this week at www.hokiesportsinfo.com/vick.</p>
        <p>At the ESPY awards in February, where Vick won for best college athlete, he spoke to Peyton Manning. ''He told me, it's only going to get worse, that I might as well get used to it,'' Vick said.</p>
        <p>And so does his team. While his top receivers, Andre Davis and Emmett Johnson, are juniors, the defense lost eight starters. ''We'll be going with 10 new guys on defense, and we lost our entire kicking game,'' Beamer said. ''Let's make sure we stay within reality.''</p>
        <p>Often hard to do with Vick at quarterback.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Rutgers was picked to finish eighth, or last, in the Big East news media poll Thursday, but Coach TERRY SHEA was not surprised. ''I'm not going to use it as a motivational tool,'' he said. Syracuse was picked third, followed by Boston College, Pittsburgh, West Virginia and Temple. . . . At the Big Ten's kickoff luncheon in Chicago on Thursday, Coach JOE PATERNO of Penn State said he planned to play quarterback RASHARD CASEY, a senior who was charged with assaulting an off-duty police officer in Hoboken, N.J., earlier this year. The coach said he would play Casey ''until something convinces me I shouldn't.'' Casey has pleaded not guilty to the aggravated assault charge in the May 14 incident.</p>
