        <p>There was no mistaking the dejection on David Cone's face tonight, his mouth turned down, lips pursed, sadness weighing on his eyes like anvils. It was the look of helplessness. It was the first inning.</p>
        <p>Cone's reputation is built on dominance, and the Minnesota Twins were burying him. He is known for stubborn relentlessness, but as Cone worked deeper into trouble on the eve of the three-month anniversary of his last victory, defeat must have felt inevitable.</p>
        <p>Cone lost again, allowing nine hits, five walks and eight runs in five-plus innings, and he lasted that long only because Manager Joe Torre wanted to exhaust every possibility of a Yankees' comeback that would rescue the veteran pitcher from his losing streak. But the Yankees were defeated, 9-3, their four-game winning streak ending as Cone's record fell to 1-10, and it would seem his place in the team's rotation is in danger.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to try not to let it end this way,'' Cone said. ''Athletes all want to go out on their own terms, and I'm certainly going to try to, in any event.''</p>
        <p>He has been the ace most of his career, embracing the responsibility that entails, but his troubles are dragging down the team. In Cone's last 12 starts, the Yankees are 0-12, and they are 32-19 in games started by others during that span. Only one pitcher in club history has made more starts with only one victory to show for it: Fritz Peterson, who was 1-10 after 22 starts in 1967.</p>
        <p>Torre said that Cone is ''one of my pitchers,'' and that he has seen enough to believe Cone can pitch effectively.</p>
        <p>Said Cone: ''I still think there's a good pitcher in here somewhere, and I haven't been able to get it out. I still believe that. I still believe, in my heart of hearts, that I'm a good pitcher. It just doesn't look that way right now.''</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old Cone extracted some hope from his previous defeat. He felt good about an adjustment he made to his pitching mechanics: he held his hands near his right hip in the middle of his windup, rather than raising his hands and then dropping them before throwing; this shortened his motion and helped his control against Tampa Bay on July 22.</p>
        <p>He was relieved after six innings of that game, having thrown only 94 pitches, and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre knew Cone was angry. But Cone remained mute about that decision, realizing he isn't pitching well enough to complain, and focused on tonight's start. Cone finished his warm-ups before tonight's game, flipped the ball to Stottlemyre. ''Let's go,'' Stottlemyre said, patting him on the shoulder, and Cone nodded.</p>
        <p>He could not control his fastball and fell behind in the count repeatedly. His fourth pitch of the game was smacked down the left-field line for a double by Denny Hocking; Cristian Guzman bounced Cone's ninth pitch for a single, and Hocking scored.</p>
        <p>Cone tries to analyze his starts as objectively as possible and can be brutally honest with himself, to the point where it probably hurts him; Cone is not superstitious, does not blame fate. Still, he cannot comprehend why trouble hits him in light-speed fashion, why it seems he cannot get away with any mistakes.</p>
        <p>Cone walked Matt Lawton on four pitches, and Ron Coomer singled home the Twins' second run. David Ortiz walked. The bases were loaded, and still nobody was out.</p>
        <p>Cone was missing badly by now, his fastball and slider straying, and when he threw two balls out of the strike zone to Corey Koskie, the phone in the Yankees' bullpen rang and Jason Grimsley started warming up.</p>
        <p>The Twins hit two fly balls and another run scored, and teammates on the Yankees' bench began jawing at the home plate umpire, Gregory Gibson, and Gibson answered, even as Cone was set to throw the ball. After Jones struck out to end the inning, Cone walked over and spoke pointedly to Gibson, suggesting the umpire call time before bickering.</p>
        <p>Cone threw 36 pitches in that first inning and 21 in the second. He got through the third inning easily and retired the first hitter in the fourth, gaining rhythm, sometimes glancing at the radar-gun readings posted on the face of the upper deck in left field. His fastball was hitting a solid 88 miles an hour. Cone displayed a sliver of confidence by dropping his arm angle to throw a rare sidearm slider to Chad Moeller, Minnesota's ninth-place hitter.</p>
        <p>But Cone went on to walk Moeller. He walked Hocking, as well, and when Lawton laced a breaking ball into the left-field corner, the bullpen coach Tony Cloninger reached down and held his left hand on the bullpen phone, anticipating the call that came a second later, after both Minnesota's runners scored.</p>
        <p>Cone looked toward the bullpen as he departed the mound at the end of the fourth inning to see if somebody was warming up. Minnesota led by 5-0, but when the Yankees scored three runs in the top of the fifth, Torre stayed with Cone.</p>
        <p>Grimsley got up again in the fifth, which Cone survived. But Cone's pitch count was 106 at the outset of the sixth inning, and when Jones singled to lead off the sixth, Grimsley got up one more time.</p>
        <p>A pop fly dropped for a single. Hocking hit a double and the runners charged around the bases. That was all. The Yankees' infielders gathered around Cone at the mound. Not one appeared to say anything before Cone handed the ball to Torre.</p>
        <p>Denny Neagle, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens are permanent members of the five-man rotation. Orlando Hernandez is working his way back from the disabled list. Dwight Gooden is 3-0 with a 2.16 earned run average in three starts.</p>
        <p>Cone tries not to think about all this.</p>
