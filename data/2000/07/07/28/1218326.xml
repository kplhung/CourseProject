        <p>Following are excerpts from the report of District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau to Police Commissioner Howard Safir:</p>
        <p>On March 16, 2000, at approximately 12:28 a.m., Patrick Dorismond, 26, was killed by a bullet discharged from the gun of Detective Anthony Vasquez of the Manhattan Gang Investigations Unit during an undercover ''buy-and-bust'' operation. . . . At the time of his death Dorismond was employed as a security guard, was unarmed, and was not selling drugs. . . .</p>
        <p>The fourth May-June, 2000, grand jury received 42 exhibits into evidence and heard testimony from 24 witnesses -- a number which included every individual who had either seen or heard a portion of the incident. The grand jury has now concluded its investigation, and has voted not to bring criminal charges against Detective Vasquez.</p>
        <p>The investigation revealed the details of an encounter that, extremely rapidly and completely unexpectedly, escalated into violence.  Shortly after midnight, Dorismond left the Wakamba Lounge, a bar on Eighth Avenue near 37th Street, and was standing outside talking with a friend. He was approached by undercover Detective Anderson Moran, who was seeking to buy crack cocaine. Detectives Anthony Vasquez and Julio Cruz were acting as plainclothes backups to Detective Moran. Dorismond reacted angrily to Moran's approach, losing his temper and ultimately punching Moran in the face. In the course of the brief melee that followed, Detective Vasquez drew his gun. Dorismond grabbed it, they struggled for control of the weapon, and the gun discharged at close range, striking Dorismond once in the chest. . . .</p>
        <p>Detective Vasquez had been about 15 feet away from the group when the first punch was thrown, and he had begun moving diagonally across the sidewalk to where Moran and Dorismond were grappling with each other. . . . Vasquez says that he yelled the word ''police'' several times. Moran recalls hearing it twice, and Cruz once. . . .</p>
        <p>Vasquez did not see a gun in anyone's hands.  In his view, however, if he waited to see someone else pull a gun before drawing his own, he would not be ready to use his gun if he had to, and he or someone else might be shot. Vasquez therefore decided to draw his weapon so that he would be ready to use it if necessary. . . . As he was pulling the gun out and beginning to raise it, someone collided with him and grabbed the gun and the hand in which he held it. He states that it took him a second to realize that the person who had grabbed him was Dorismond. . . .</p>
        <p>By Vasquez's account, he and Dorismond struggled over the weapon, up against each other, chest to chest. The two were both big men. Dorismond, at 6 foot 1 inch, weighed 222 pounds; Vasquez, at 6 feet, weighed 240. Vasquez had pulled his gun out with his right hand, which Dorismond now gripped with his left.  Vasquez used his left arm to block Dorismond's other hand from coming over to grab the gun as well. At one point the gun was pushed up near Vasquez's head. He pushed the gun down toward Dorismond and they continued to grapple briefly. According to Vasquez, he could feel Dorismond twisting the gun. Suddenly the gun went off. Vasquez says that he does not know where it was pointed when it was discharged.  He did not intentionally pull the trigger, and in fact does not know how the discharge came about. The struggle lasted only seconds. . . .</p>
        <p>At first, no one realized that Dorismond had been hit. Vasquez briefly continued to struggle with him. Cruz pushed Dorismond away from Vasquez; later he discovered blood on his hands, and realized that he must have pushed Dorismond in the chest. . . .</p>
