        <p>Just a few weeks ago, foreign executives here looked at Vietnam and saw a Communist backwater dabbling halfheartedly in free enterprise and foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Today, they see a budding market in a country that has signed an agreement granting the United States, a former enemy, access to many sections of its economy.</p>
        <p>The change is largely due to that trade agreement, signed by Washington and Hanoi officials on July 13. Lawyers, economists and executives are only starting to make sense of the new accord, a densely worded volume of diplomatic and legal language. The consensus is that the agreement is the most significant business development here since the country reopened to foreign investment almost 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>''It has changed the landscape completely,'' said Nigel Russell, a lawyer who has worked for seven years in Vietnam advising American and other foreign clients for Phillips Fox, an Australian law firm.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which is subject to approval in both countries, would give Vietnam the same normal trade relations, subject to annual review by Congress, that China had until it secured permanent status this spring. In return for gradually opening its economy to United States investment and exports, Vietnam immediately gains improved access for its products in American markets, with the average tariff on Vietnamese goods falling to 3 percent from almost 40 percent.</p>
        <p>''This is a very comprehensive agreement that will open a lot of doors to U.S. business in Vietnam,'' said Frederick Burke, a lawyer with Baker &amp; Mackenzie at a briefing to the American Chamber of Commerce here. The agreement, he said, also represents ''dramatic progress for Vietnam in its integration into the global economic community.''</p>
        <p>That said, few people here are under the illusion that change will come easily or that a recent exodus by disenchanted foreign investors will quickly be reversed. Much will still depend on the willingness of Vietnam's elderly Communist rulers to enforce the agreement.</p>
        <p>''Implementation is going to be a serious question,'' said Anthony Salzman, who sells Caterpillar products in Vietnam. ''As an American businessman, I'll be looking at that.''</p>
        <p>Vietnam has been experimenting with market reforms of some sort since 1987. Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in 1994, American companies have been trying with mixed success to participate in that experiment, but it took almost five years for the two nations to reach an agreement formalizing the terms of a trade and investment pact.</p>
        <p>Its immediate effect on Vietnam's economy may be relatively small. The World Bank estimates that Vietnamese exports to the United States would rise to $768 million a year, compared with $504 million last year. Even in an economy as small as Vietnam's, that would increase average incomes by less than 1 percent, the agency estimates.</p>
        <p>''The real economic impact is not as great as people expect,'' said Dinh Tuan Viet, an economist at the World Bank's office here.</p>
        <p>The quickest beneficiaries are likely to be foreign textile and apparel manufacturers with plants in this country, such as Nike and the lingerie maker Triumph. United States tariffs on brassieres and panties, for example, would drop to zero from about 60 percent, contributing to the World Bank estimate of a potential 1,500 percent increase in clothing exports from Vietnam to the United States.</p>
        <p>Although Vietnamese workers would earn the wages from such a boom, the country does not supply the raw material and so the broad economy would reap relatively little benefit, Mr. Viet of the World Bank said. A greater benefit to the economy, he said, would come from cuts in tariffs on processed food, especially fish and shrimp products.</p>
        <p>More profound are the changes the agreement makes to Vietnam's rules on foreign investment. Economists say these will force the country to adopt international norms on accounting and corporate governance, and accelerate economic changes already under way, especially the transfer of state-owned industry to private ownership. Last week, for instance, Vietnam opened a long-awaited stock exchange in the hope of mobilizing private capital.</p>
        <p>''It opens up the economy to a whole series of competitive forces,'' Wong Yit Fan, regional economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore, said of the agreement.</p>
        <p>For American companies interested in Vietnam's market of nearly 80 million people, the agreement offers important concessions. It phases out quotas on a range of exports from meat to motorcycles and gradually cuts tariffs on everything from Maybelline mascara to Motorola cellular phones. It establishes the right of United States accounting and law firms to establish wholly owned subsidiaries in Vietnam and over time opens the country to American banks and insurers.</p>
        <p>The agreement also protects intellectual property rights, including software and semiconductor designs, and prohibits Vietnam from applying different product standards to American companies or from charging foreign business higher fees for phone calls, utilities or airfare. Perhaps most tellingly, it seeks to eliminate the regulatory caprice that is the subject of many investor complaints. The agreement would oblige Vietnam to end the arbitrary application of rules to foreign companies and to set forth rules well in advance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burke of Baker &amp; Mackenzie said the agreement's significance was amplified by nondiscrimination clauses in Vietnam's trade agreements with other nations. Companies from China, Japan and Europe would also benefit from the new terms.</p>
        <p>Even so, it stops short in many areas. Hanoi retains restrictions on trade in economically critical products like oil, rice and gold, as well as in publications and films.</p>
        <p>The agreement apparently does not do much to improve Vietnam's Internet infrastructure. It mimics China's limits on foreign involvement in telecommunications and does little to promote the flow of venture capital to finance the high-technology start-ups that other developing nations have deemed crucial to taking part in a new economy.</p>
