        <p>It is a puzzling political season for George Gauthier.</p>
        <p>Although the major presidential candidates were identified months ago, Mr. Gauthier, a builder, has no idea whom he will vote for.</p>
        <p>He knows where he stands on the issues and has thoughtful, nuanced ideas about what a president should be. But so far, no candidate has given him enough to go on.</p>
        <p>''Bush doesn't have the strengths in foreign and national politics that his father did,'' said Mr. Gauthier, 59, who also runs an organization to help lower-income people obtain homes,  ''and there's been good and bad state governors as presidents, so he comes into it having to answer why he should be executive of the United States.''</p>
        <p>''With Gore, my fear is that his programs would be too big, too expensive,'' said Mr. Gauthier, who voted for Republicans in the last four presidential elections, Democrats in the previous three and knows only that he will not vote for a third-party candidate this year.</p>
        <p>''I think both of them show leadership potential, an ability to project their vision of the future,'' he said. ''Neither is going to effect major radical change. It's a question of how they would lean, which bias they have. It's hard to find the best candidate.''</p>
        <p>With the Republican and Democratic conventions coming up, Mr. Gauthier is hardly in the minority, interviews with voters suggest. In dozens of discussions in Evanston, a diverse, middle-class suburb just north of Chicago in a critical swing-vote state, people were studiously skeptical, awaiting answers and wary of the campaign games politicians play.</p>
        <p>In the absence of a single urgent issue like war or economic crisis, voters were sizing up candidates as managers, stewards and respect-worthy leaders rather than as rallying, agenda-driven politicians. Voters were more interested in what kind of cabinet officials and Supreme Court justices the candidates would appoint and in how they would work with Congress than in where they stood on every issue.</p>
        <p>And while most said they wanted a president with consistency and integrity, someone unlikely to be swayed by interest-group pressure, they doubted whether any candidate had those qualities.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to see a leader who's not a captive of special interests, but it may be impossible,'' said Edith Eisner, a 75-year-old retired English teacher who said she would vote for Al Gore. ''I think both the candidates now can be pushed around.''</p>
        <p>Al Butkus, the president of an engineering firm who said he would vote for George W. Bush, said: ''My big concern about presidential politics is once you get to be able to run for president you've had to make so many promises and compromises that you've compromised yourself coming through the system.''</p>
        <p>In Evanston, home of Northwestern University and one of the few racially diverse communities in the Illinois suburbs, more people vote for Democrats. But the interviews focused on people across the political spectrum. All except one of those interviewed said they had ruled out  voting for the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party. Most considered them extreme or narrowly focused, although some said they found Mr. Nader appealing but unelectable.</p>
        <p>Strikingly, among people who said they would support Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush, there was frequently little passion about the candidate.</p>
        <p>Cindy Wilson, a 40-year-old civil rights lawyer, said she had always voted Democratic and would again this year.</p>
        <p>Still, she said: ''I think Gore is questionable. I don't think he tells the truth all the time.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson, with two children and a husband who is also a lawyer, said she was fairly certain that Mr. Gore agreed with her on education, the environment, affirmative action and other issues, but she had reservations about ''him as a person.'' She said she believed, for example, that he was ''pandering'' when he said that Elian Gonzalez and his father should be given permanent residency status, and she called his ethics on campaign financing ''a little loose.''</p>
        <p>''He seems to always say what people want to hear. I can't get excited about him and trust him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butkus, 48, who typically backs Republicans for president, said of Governor Bush: ''He doesn't have a lot of political experience. There's just not a big book on him to let you now how he'd act in situations.'' He said he was ''not happy'' with Mr. Bush's vague response about whether he had used cocaine, but added, ''There's abuses on the other side.''</p>
        <p>''The one thing I'm impressed with Bush about is that he has been picking good people and they're sticking by him,'' Mr. Butkus said.</p>
        <p>People seem well aware of what presidential power can and cannot do. Their priorities included Supreme Court appointments and keeping Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chairman. Some would like a foreign policy leader to help resolve the Middle East conflict, deal firmly with Russia and either scrap or build a missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Some mentioned health care that would be affordable for all citizens and progress in race relations. Most said they believed the economy would continue strongly under either candidate. And no one linked his or her vote to a single issue, like school vouchers or the death penalty -- indeed, a few said such issues should be left to the states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butkus's wife, Ellen, 47, said she strongly opposed abortion, but would not make that a litmus test. ''The check mark in the little box just doesn't give you a sense of all the different ways that this candidate could affect things,'' said Mrs. Butkus, a nurse.</p>
        <p>Rather, Mrs. Butkus, who is undecided and would not rule out Mr. Nader, is more concerned about how candidates would deal with racial issues and what impact they would have on issues like the death penalty and school choice.</p>
        <p>Several people seemed to favor both the probusiness, smaller-government approach historically associated with Republicans and the sense of social justice and inclusiveness typically linked to Democrats.</p>
        <p>''I want someone who's going to have a balance in being generally businesslike in the management of government,'' said Don Colleton, a 58-year-old lawyer leaning toward Mr. Bush. ''But I'm not one to play around with some of these social issues. I want folks to behave in a way that is just resolute in acknowledging the intrinsic equal dignity of members of the human race, whatever color or size they come in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gauthier exemplifies the sense of wanting to borrow from both Republicans and Democrats. He says that the federal government should deal with social problems by financing private nonprofit agencies like his housing coalition, which he contends are more cost-effective  than government agencies. He says he thinks a prescription drug plan should include means-testing so that those people most in need will benefit, and that eventually, there will have to be means tests for Social Security and Medicare. He also contends that school vouchers are unworkable, and that the government should take some of the money now being spent on the military and battling illegal drugs and put it into drug treatment.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Gauthier is so concerned with balance that he said he might vote for the candidate whose party appeared as though it would not have a majority in Congress.</p>
        <p>Several people expressed concern that Mr. Bush might be influenced by radical right-wing voices in the Republican Party, but none seemed concerned that Mr. Gore would be similarly pulled from the center.</p>
        <p>''I think Bush's heart is one place and his head is another,'' said the Rev. Larry Bullock, an African Methodist Episcopal minister who also owns construction businesses. ''I think he is a compassionate conservative, but I think he's too beholden to certain wings of his party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bullock said he would probably vote for Mr. Gore, but wanted the Democratic candidate to ''show a freshness and a newness.''</p>
        <p>''He's really got to rattle those bones,'' Mr. Bullock said. ''Clinton gave us the bridge to the 21st century. Gore needs to tell us what's on the other side of the bridge.''</p>
        <p>Most of those interviewed said their view of President Clinton would not affect their vote. Supporters and critics said Mr. Gore was appropriately loyal in defending the president in the Monica Lewinsky matter. And most said that he deserved neither credit nor criticism for Clinton administration policies.</p>
        <p>One exception was Lorraine Morton, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, who said she did not have ''great enthusiasm'' for Mr. Gore, but ''Clinton did a fantastic job,'' and if elected, ''Gore can pick up the telephone and say, 'Bill. what do you think about so and so.' ''</p>
        <p>Although most people said Mr. Bush made a good choice in Dick Cheney as his running mate, those interviewed said it would not affect their views.</p>
        <p>As the campaign heats up, the candidates might do well to listen to the likes of Barry Slotnick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slotnick, 28, who works in his family's travel business and owns a fitness equipment company, considers himself ''fiscally conservative and socially liberal,'' pro-entrepreneur and pro-abortion rights. He voted Republican in 1992 and 1996, but started this campaign admiring Bill Bradley, especially his progressive views on race relations. ''As Bradley's situation started to fade,'' he said, ''I really took an interest in John McCain.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Slotnick is ''very much on the fence,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I like the Republican platform when it comes to small government,'' he said, but added that he was worried about ''some very frightening people in the far reaches of the Republican Party, the far right.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Bush, he said, he is unsure ''how much has been attained because he's daddy's boy.''</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's any question that Gore brings more experience, having been vice president for eight years,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Slotnick said he believed that Mr. Bush ''could probably get a good cabinet together.'' And while ''Bush seems to me like a grown-up frat boy,'' Mr. Slotnick said, he also ''seems like a more approachable, more normal guy.''</p>
        <p>''He seems less political,'' Mr. Slotnick said. ''Gore, everything he does seems a little rehearsed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Slotnick said he thinks ''both Gore and Bush can keep the momentum in the economy going,'' adding:  ''So this year I'm really looking more at the person. At the end of the day you look for someone who really you can look up to and trust. Are they a good representation of the country?''</p>
