        <p>Amid a flurry of political and diplomatic moves on both sides, Israel and the Palestinians made plain today that they are eager to put the failed Camp David talks behind them and move forward with a renewed peace effort.</p>
        <p>The two sides confirmed that negotiators would meet on Sunday at the border of the Gaza Strip, and said that ideas floated at Camp David by President Clinton -- including proposals that the Palestinians rejected on the future of East Jerusalem -- have carried the peace effort further than ever before.</p>
        <p>Less than 24 hours after completing their long flights home, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, laid out new travel plans suggesting that both believe that some form of agreement -- perhaps only partial, officials said, and possibly excluding the deal-breaking issue of Jerusalem -- may yet be possible in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
        <p>There was a hectic round of consultations between Israeli ministers and opposition leaders, suggesting that Mr. Barak's beleaguered coalition government will survive a series of parliamentary votes next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was to fly to Egypt on Friday to meet with President Hosni Mubarak, but later today he delayed that trip indefinitely; his office cited scheduling difficulties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat had stopped in Alexandria on his way back from Camp David on Wednesday to brief Mr. Mubarak. The Egyptian leader, a key player in Middle East peace moves for two decades, is seen by both sides as crucial to the shape of any eventual agreement -- especially on Jerusalem, the issue on which the Camp David negotiations reportedly foundered on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, for his part, announced he would leave before the weekend for a whistle-stop tour that will include talks with President Jacques Chirac of France, long regarded as one of the Western nations most sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, and on to meetings with a succession of unspecified Arab leaders. Mr. Arafat has usually made such tours after major negotiating sessions, but with the issue of Jerusalem now squarely on the table, these briefings were certain to be more critical and intense.</p>
        <p>Over all, the various trips and meetings reflected a sense that something substantial had occurred even though Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat came down from the Catoctin Mountains seemingly empty-handed.</p>
        <p>In effect, commentators said, the decision to return so rapidly to the negotiating table reflected a recognition that the negotiations, in particular the American ideas for a settlement in Jerusalem, have swept the historic rivals into new political terrain that they must now explore, and from which neither can easily retreat.</p>
        <p>The plan put forward by Mr. Clinton, as outlined by Israeli and Palestinian officials who have spoken with reporters here, would have established a complex mosaic of jurisdictions in East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Gilead Sher, one of Mr. Barak's top aides at Camp David, said the president had proposed that Mr. Arafat have a presidential office in the Muslim quarter of the walled Old City of Jerusalem, a move that according to Israeli commentators would allow the Palestinians to claim that they had fulfilled their pledge to establish the capital of their new state in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Other Israeli officials said that the American proposals had provided for some of East Jerusalem's Arab quarters to be annexed to other Palestinian territories outside the city and expanded to establish a new city to be known as Al Quds, the historic Arabic name for Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>In addition, these officials said, the Palestinians would have been given vaguely defined authority, short of sovereignty, over the Muslim and Christian quarters in the Old City, control of the Dome of the Rock and other Muslim holy places, and a new bridge allowing Palestinians unhindered access to the Muslim holy places from areas under their control to the east of the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sher told Israel radio that the talks with Mr. Clinton opened a new horizon, even if the Jerusalem proposals were rejected by Mr. Arafat. ''I would say that definitely yes, it's possible to finish the conflict and reach a reasonable settlement in not too long a time as long as there is talk between the sides,'' Mr. Sher said.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, a senior Arafat aide at Camp David who has taken a positive stance from the day the talks concluded, confirmed that he would meet with Oded Eran, a senior Israeli negotiator, to renew peace talks on Sunday at Erez, on the border between Israel and Gaza.</p>
        <p>Repeating remarks that he made  Wednesday on the ABC News program ''Nightline,'' Mr. Erekat told reporters in the West Bank city of Jericho that ''many taboo subjects'' had been discussed at Camp David for the first time, including Jerusalem, and that the two sides were now ''closer than ever'' to ending their 52-year-old conflict. ''I don't think our negotiations will ever be the same after Camp David,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Erez meeting will follow one held there on Wednesday between Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, and Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a senior aide to Mr. Arafat, at which the two men discussed joint efforts to prevent outbreaks of violence by Israelis or Palestinians discontented by the events at Camp David. On both sides, officials pointed to the Wednesday talks as a mark of how far the peace effort has come since the days when orchestration of violent protests was a ready tactic for Palestinian officials seeking to wring concessions from Israel.</p>
        <p>Marwan Barghouti, a top Arafat official on the West Bank, told reporters that neither side could gain from violence. ''We must keep things quiet and wait until September,'' he said, referring to the Sept. 13 date Mr. Arafat has set as the deadline for unilaterally declaring an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The change of mood was not without its darker notes. Both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat, in statements and through aides, continued to stake out what in the parlance of the region are known as ''red lines'' -- the limits of what the two sides publicly claim they can accept in any final settlement on Jerusalem, on Jewish settlements, on the return of Palestinian refugees and on other issues that have been left unresolved in the stuttering process that began with the Oslo agreement in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, for example, continued to insist at a sparsely attended rally in the Palestinian-controlled town of Ramallah on the West Bank that  ''there is not one among us who can give up a grain of soil of noble Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Barak, since returning to Jerusalem, has been emphasizing that Israel, by accepting key parts of the Clinton plan involving Jerusalem, has escaped ever having to compromise sovereignty over the city in any comprehensive way, and, in addition, has established the principle of Israeli sovereignty over most of the 145 Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's immediate challenge was to shore up his political position at home, and the signs as he prepared for his journey to Egypt were that his fractious, 14-month-old government would survive a battery of three no-confidence votes in the Parliament on Monday, as well as a separate vote on Wednesday in which opposition groups will seek the dissolution of the Parliament and a new election.</p>
        <p>Head counts of voting intentions among more than a dozen political parties and factions, combined with intensive new contacts between Mr. Barak and two coalition parties that left the government on the eve of the Camp David talks -- the religious Shas party and the left-wing Meretz party -- suggested that Mr. Barak's coalition, led by his One Israel movement, would survive with a plurality, even if denied a majority.</p>
        <p>After the votes, the Parliament will adjourn for its summer recess, giving Mr. Barak, if he survives, a respite from the constant political challenges. Mr. Barak is also likely to elude an option that some conservatives in the ruling coalition have urged on him in the wake of the Camp David talks, the formation of a ''national unity government'' with Likud, the right-wing opposition party led by Ariel Sharon. That option appeared to be as good as dead today after leading officials of One Israel and Likud pronounced it unacceptable because of the harshly opposed stands the two parties have taken on the peace effort.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was scheduled to meet tonight with Mr. Sharon, but officials said his purpose was to brief the opposition leader on the Camp David talks, not to discuss a joint or ''emergency'' government, something Mr. Barak has said he would favor only in the event that frustrations after the Camp David talks exploded into to violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak was said to be in no hurry to reconstitute his tattered coalition ahead of the Monday parliamentary votes, preferring to wait until after the votes so as to have a freer hand in choosing new coalition partners.</p>
