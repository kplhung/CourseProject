        <p>The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater offered an all-Ailey program on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater.

        <p>The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater offered an all-Ailey program on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater. The performance, an attraction of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, included four of Ailey's most popular works. Yet although the dances were familiar, they seemed sonically and visually fresh.</p>
        <p>What helped make the performance special was the live music for all but one work. Economics have forced the Ailey company to dance to taped accompaniment on occasion. But nothing can equal the impact of musicians in the pit: in this case, an ensemble of instrumentalists and singers under the direction of Tania Leon. They made it clear that one of the wonderful things about live music is that it is produced by living people.</p>
        <p>Such music is especially appropriate for an Ailey performance, for he was choreographically concerned with living people: with their hopes, fears, loves, frustrations and aspirations. He knew how to translate behavior patterns into dance patterns, and his designs in space were often bold. At the State Theater his choreography looked especially clear in form, and the dancers let their vitality project throughout the theater.</p>
        <p>''Blues Suite'' (1958), which opened the evening, is a dance of smoldering passions to songs that, as a program note declares, could be called hymns to the soul's ''secular regions.'' One can easily imagine this work taking place in a smoky room on a lonely night. In addition to the sounds of singing, the night shown onstage was punctuated by tolling bells and mournfully whistling trains.</p>
        <p>The strength of the company's men was apparent throughout the dance. Effective dramatic sequences included ''House of the Rising Sun,'' a vignette about a New Orleans brothel, in which Asha Thomas, Desiree Vlad and Linda Caceres expressed feelings of sadness and rage, and ''Backwater Blues,'' in which Renee Robinson and Glenn A. Sims portrayed sassy lovers who found squabbling fun.</p>
        <p>Ailey also depicted friendly rivalry in ''Pas de Duke'' (1976), to Duke Ellington. In addition to honoring the composer, the punning title of this pas de deux is a reminder that ''dukes'' is a slang term for ''fists.'' Linda-Denise Evans and Matthew Rushing were not required to engage in choreographic fisticuffs, but a sense of competition dominated the duet, both in the passages in which they danced together and in the vigorous solo for Mr. Rushing and the slinky and playful one for Ms. Evans.</p>
        <p>Ailey turned lyrical in ''Memoria'' (1979), his choreographic elegy in honor of his friend Joyce Trisler, a noted dancer, choreographer and teacher. The accompanying score by Keith Jarrett includes cascades of virtuosic piano music, and this was the only work danced to tape. ''Memoria'' is a heartfelt communal ritual requiring a large cast. On this occasion the Ailey company was augmented by students from the Ailey School, under the direction of Kelvin Rotardier and Dana Hash. The ever-flowing steps for all the dancers complemented the swirls of piano music.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately ''Memoria'' is somewhat long-winded. Yet this performance was held together by the luminous presence of Ms. Evans, whose ease, confidence and quiet intensity made her a symbol of the life force.</p>
        <p>The evening concluded with a repeat performance of ''Revelations'' (1960). This beautifully choreographed suite of spirituals was as stirring as ever. The ''Fix Me, Jesus'' episode was especially poignant because of the way Ms. Caceres looked vulnerable, while Mr. Sims became a protective presence who never failed to hold and support her. In ''Sinner Man'' Benoit-Swan Pouffer, Clifton Brown and Vernard J. Gilmore were convincing as sinners desperately, and vainly, trying to escape God's judgment. During the finale the audience, as usual, felt inspired to clap along to ''Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham.''</p>
