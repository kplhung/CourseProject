        <p>Dhani Jones, the promising Giants rookie whose season ended with a torn knee ligament on Wednesday, said today that he had held out hope that his injury was a sprain until he saw the results of his magnetic resonance imaging test.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't lie,'' said Jones, who will have surgery on his torn anterior cruciate ligament in about three weeks. ''And that hits you.''</p>
        <p>Jones said his first reaction was frustration. ''There's always that quick moment when you feel that way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But what's that going to do? I got my spirits up quickly right after. I've always said that I come up the rough side of the mountain. It's a test of strength and faith.''</p>
        <p>Jones was injured on a kickoff drill that called for him to sprint down the field and then to make a cut after some simulated contact. On a field wet with recent rain, Jones slipped and fell to the ground. He walked off the field but was soon whisked away by trainers.</p>
        <p>The injury to Jones, who was the team's sixth-round pick out of Michigan, has shaken the Giants' organization -- much more than the loss of a sixth-round draft choice might in other National Football League camps.</p>
        <p>It strikes the Giants particularly hard because they are in desperate need of quick reserve linebackers for their special teams. And Jones was expected to occasionally play as a nickel linebacker because last year's nickel linebacker, Scott Galyon, left the team as a free agent.</p>
        <p>In addition, Jones, a smart and free-spirited player, was becoming popular with the coaches, in part, because football coaches always like 6-foot-1-inch, 240-pound players who are fast and aware.</p>
        <p>''Things change,'' Jones said today. ''One minute you're running down the field and another you're being tested to get yourself back to where you belong. You take the blows of fate and move on.''</p>
