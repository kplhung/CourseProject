        <p>Flight recorders show that the Air France Concorde that crashed on Tuesday had problems with both engines on the plane's left side and that the crew reported that they could not retract the landing gear, investigators said today.</p>
        <p>The recorders make clear that the plane was too far down the runway to abort the flight when air controllers told the crew that they could see flames at the back of the plane.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, the pilots reported that one engine, known as No. 2, had failed, and immediately on takeoff announced that they could not retract the landing gear.</p>
        <p>The flight recorders also show that the other engine on the left side of the plane, known as No. 1, lost power briefly during takeoff. Less than a minute into the flight, the investigators said, engine No. 1 lost power again. Then the plane, failing to gain altitude or speed, rolled sharply to the left and crashed into a small hotel on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the investigators said the plane had been breaking up throughout its brief flight because debris was found along its path. They also noted that scraps of tire had been found on the runway.</p>
        <p>But many questions remained about the cause of the crash -- whether it was related to objects like parts of tires or wheels being sucked into an engine, last-minute repairs made to engine No. 2 before Air France Flight 4590 took off from Charles de Gaulle airport, or still some other reason. Experts said tonight that flames at the back of the plane might well have damaged the fuel and hydraulic lines, which would have prevented the landing gear from being taken up.</p>
        <p>The investigators from the French government agency that investigates crashes said that the investigation was still in its preliminary stages and far from determining what had caused the supersonic jet to crash, killing 113 people.</p>
        <p>''It won't be until all the facts and elements have been assembled and synthesized that a complete analysis of the circumstances and causes of the accident can be known,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Some experts said today that it was unlikely that the repairs to the No. 2 engine's thrust reversers had anything to do with the kind of fire that seemed to engulf the left side of the plane as the plane's captain, Christian Marty, tried desperately to cut short the flight and land at the smaller, nearby airport, Le Bourget. The repair job, the experts said, would have had to have been badly botched -- causing a rupture in a fuel line, for instance -- to create the kind of engine collapse that occurred.</p>
        <p>Others have speculated that it was more likely that something was sucked into the engine on takeoff. The finding that pieces of tire were on the runway gave this theory more weight today. Brian Trubshaw, a former chief test-pilot for the British team that developed the Concorde, said today's findings suggested that either a tire or a wheel sucked into the engine might have been the cause of the failure of engine No. 2.</p>
        <p>''When I hear today's facts, it could well be that this was the thing that started the sequence of events,'' Mr. Trubshaw said. ''But you really can't be sure until all the facts are in.''</p>
        <p>While investigators studied the clues, many relatives of the victims and Air France employees, gathered for a memorial service at the Church of La Madeleine in Paris. Flight attendants and pilots in uniform formed a kind of honor guard as the mourners, some clutching hands and holding on to each other, climbed the church's front steps. During the service, attended by a German delegation headed by Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher and several French ministers, 113 candles were placed on the altar.</p>
        <p>At the start of the ceremony, a minute of silence was observed in each of Paris's three airports.</p>
        <p>In Gonesse, a gritty working-class suburb, firefighters finished the grim job of collecting the bodies of the 100 passengers, 9 crew members and 4 hotel employees who were killed in the fireball created by the crash.</p>
        <p>Many of the town's residents have hailed the pilot as a kind of hero for bringing his jet down in a sparsely populated part of town, believing that he deliberately tried to avoid the center. But experts say there is no way to judge whether he intentionally navigated the plane toward a sparsely populated field. Pilots in the kind of crisis that Captain Marty was facing are scarcely aware of what is beneath them, they said. In many cases, they even lose control of the plane because they are so busy dealing with the crisis that they ''forget to fly.''</p>
        <p>French officials said they had still not made any decisions about when to put Air France's remaining Concorde's back in service. The sleek needle-nose jets are a favorite of celebrities and corporate executives who pay as much as $11,000 for a round-trip trans-Atlantic flight at 1,300 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>But Air France announced that it would pay about $20,000 to the relatives of each victim for their ''immediate material needs.'' The airline also said it would pay for the victims'  funerals and any psychological counseling the relatives needed.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the French investigators said that a preliminary report on the crash would not be ready until the end of August.</p>
        <p>Until Tuesday, the Concorde, sometimes criticized as noisy and costly, had never crashed.</p>
        <p>But according to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Concorde has had a history of small problems with its wheels and tires.</p>
        <p>The plane's engines may have been damaged by debris from its own tires on three previous occasions. In a fourth incident, a tire blown on takeoff caused fuel and hydraulic leaks. But on all four of those occasions, damage was minor. Modifications were made to the wheels after the incidents.</p>
        <p>Jet engines are highly susceptible to damage to the blades inside the engine that suck air into the combustion chamber, or other internal parts. Each engine creates a vortex in front of it, a little like the swirl that appears in a full bathtub when the drain plug is pulled out, that can suck loose objects into the engine. Birds or debris on the runway are most often the problem.</p>
        <p>In June 1979, for instance, an Air France Concorde taking off from Dulles International Airport near Washington suffered fuel and hydraulic-line leaks because of debris from blown tires.</p>
        <p>The next month an Air France Concorde was taking off again from Dulles when, according to the F.A.A., a tire blew and the blades that suck air into the engine stopped pulling in air smoothly because of damage from a foreign object.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 16, 1980, a British Airways Concorde landing at Dulles blew a tire, and ''pieces of tire damaged engine and airframe,'' according to an F.A.A. database.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 19, 1981, an Air France Concorde blew a tire on takeoff from Dulles. The aircraft landed safely at Kennedy Airport with one engine shut down ''due to vibration,'' caused by part of the tire entering the engine, the F.A.A. said.</p>
