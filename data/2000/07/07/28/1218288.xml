        <p>The same reason the Mets lost out on Curt Schilling -- the only starting pitcher they say they wanted -- will probably also keep them from landing the Cleveland Indians slugger Manny Ramirez.</p>
        <p>While the Mets may not acquire a player of Ramirez's stature before the nonwaiver trading deadline Monday, they could still make significant moves.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia Phillies sent Schilling to Arizona on Wednesday when the Diamondbacks offered them what the Mets could not: an attractive package of major league-ready players. If the Indians trade Ramirez, they would want the same thing.</p>
        <p>''We would have to be overwhelmed with a deal that fills multiple positions for us within a year,'' said Mark Shapiro, the Indians' assistant general manager. ''They would have to be major leaguers or extremely close and able to have a chance to impact us.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Ramirez turned down the Indians' five-year, $75 million contract offer, another signal that he wants to test free agency this winter. Shapiro said that could ''open the door a tiny, tiny crack'' for trade talks. But with the Indians still in the race for the American League wild card, Shapiro said, ''The chances of us trading him are extremely minimal to nonexistent.''</p>
        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips said he was focusing on acquiring a relief pitcher, especially one who could take some of the burden off Turk Wendell and work late in games. While the Mets could acquire a closer and use him in a setup role, Phillips said it was highly unlikely he would trade for a starting pitcher who would be used in relief.</p>
        <p>The Texas Rangers are still negotiating with their closer, John Wetteland, on a contract extension. But he could be available in a trade and would fit the Mets' needs, as would Roberto Hernandez of Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>There are other possibilities for the Mets besides the bullpen, including shortstop and the outfield. The Mets want to trade for Baltimore Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick, but the Orioles have asked repeatedly for the Mets' top prospect, the Class AA outfielder Alex Escobar, who was included in last week's failed deal for Cincinnati's Barry Larkin. If the Orioles' demands change, a deal for Bordick could happen quickly.</p>
        <p>The San Diego Padres could be an intriguing trade partner. The Mets have been reluctant to pursue Al Martin, the left fielder who has had a good season but has been plagued by legal problems and will make $5 million next year.</p>
        <p>But the Mets have spoken with San Diego about the right-handed starter Matt Clement, a 25-year-old with exceptional stuff. If the Mets could get the Padres to part with Clement, they may agree to take on Martin's contract.</p>
        <p>Ventura Nearing Return</p>
        <p>Third baseman Robin Ventura, who is on the disabled list with a bruised right rotator cuff, had a strong batting practice yesterday and may be activated when he is eligible Saturday.</p>
        <p>''From what I gathered,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said, ''today was a noticeable step in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>McGwire Still Ailing</p>
        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals come to town tonight for their only visit this season to Shea Stadium, but first baseman Mark McGwire will probably miss the series.</p>
        <p>McGwire has not played since July 6 because of inflammation in the patellar tendon of his right knee.</p>
        <p>Kudos for Valentine</p>
        <p>Bobby Valentine moved into second place on the career victory list for Mets managers when he won his 340th game with the team yesterday in the first game of a doubleheader.</p>
        <p>Valentine, who had been tied with Gil Hodges, trails Davey Johnson, who won 595 games as manager.</p>
