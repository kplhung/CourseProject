      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says that Yasir Arafat failed to come to Camp David with compromise ideas of his own on how to share Jerusalem; says Arafat should have countered Israeli Prime Min Ehud Barak's proposals with three demands: that Palestinians have not only an administrative presence but also a sovereign presence in East Jerusalem, that they must at least share sovereignty with Israel over sacred space of the Temple Mount, and that they must have direct access from East Jerusalem to both Temple Mount and West Bank (M)</p>

        <p>And so it really comes down to this: Who is Yasir Arafat? Is he Nelson Mandela or is he Willie Nelson? That is, is he a man ready for a historic compromise, or would he just prefer to sing the old songs?</p>
        <p>What is striking is that after a two-week diplomatic slumber party at Camp David with Mr. Arafat, U.S. officials say they still don't know. But this is the key question now.</p>
        <p>The reason President Clinton was so frustrated with Mr. Arafat at Camp David was not because he refused to accept every aspect of Ehud Barak's offer for how to share Jerusalem. No one could have, or should have, expected that. The Palestinian-Muslim claim to Jerusalem is authentic, deep-rooted and heartfelt. The reason the Americans were frustrated with Mr. Arafat was that he played rope-a-dope. He came with no compromise ideas of his own on Jerusalem. He simply absorbed Mr. Barak's proposals and repeated Palestinian mantras about recovering all of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>What should Mr. Arafat have said? He should have told Mr. Barak that his ideas for granting Palestinians an administrative presence in East Jerusalem, autonomous control over the Arab neighborhoods there and religious control over the Temple Mount were a huge leap forward for an Israeli leader.</p>
        <p>But, he should have added, they didn't go far enough. The Palestinians needed three things: First, they must have not simply an administrative presence but a sovereign presence in East Jerusalem, over which they have full control and can fly their flag -- even if it is just one square block. It could be at Orient House or in the Muslim Quarter. Second, they must at least share sovereignty with the Jewish people over the sacred space of the Temple Mount, which is the site of both the ancient Jewish Temple and two of Islam's holiest mosques. And third, the Palestinians must have direct access from that sovereign Palestinian presence to both the mosques on the Temple Mount and to the Palestinian state in the West Bank, so they don't have to go through Israeli checkpoints.</p>
        <p>Such a proposal would have been further than Mr. Barak was ready to go, but it would have been a credible Palestinian counteroffer, and it would have been the basis for a real negotiation today.</p>
        <p>Because we do know now who Ehud Barak is. ''Barak is engaged in the most important historical event of the Zionist movement,'' remarked the Hebrew University philosopher Moshe Halbertal. ''Between the Mediterranean and the Jordan there are roughly five million Jews and five million Palestinian Arabs. You cannot have a Jewish and democratic state without dividing this land, and those who oppose that are dooming Israel to an apartheid state, which might have secure borders, but might not be worth securing. Barak is on a purely Zionist mission to bring Israel back into borders where it can be Jewish, just, democratic -- and secure.''</p>
        <p>Why didn't Mr. Arafat seize on that with a serious counteroffer? One view in the U.S. camp is that the Palestinians still don't know who they want to be when they grow up. They still prefer to whine and play the victim. Another view says, hold on, Mr. Arafat knows he has to engage, but he needed to show his people he could say no before he says yes.</p>
        <p>My own view is a mix. I believe Mr. Arafat presides over a decentralized, disenfranchised and dysfunctional national movement that, against all odds, has managed to survive Arab regimes that wanted to control it and Israeli governments that wanted to destroy it. He survived all these years by bobbing, weaving, straddling and never making an irrevocable decision. But now he is at the moment of truth. He must do something he has never done before: clearly define not just what the Palestinians want, but what they also believe the Jews are entitled to, and then split the difference and take responsibility.</p>
        <p>To do that he is going to have to rise above his personal history and circumstances, and also enlist the backing of Egypt and Saudi Arabia -- which represent the Muslim world, but which ran away when Mr. Clinton asked them to help Mr. Arafat fashion and sell a compromise on Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>It's not too late. Listen to Israel. Listen to the silence. It's the Israeli silent majority already redrawing maps in their heads. That is Mr. Barak's great achievement. But it has limits, and it will be utterly wasted if Mr. Arafat and the Arabs can't muster the courage to get their own people to do the same.</p>
