        <p>Since federal authorities began reviewing the police disciplinary process three years ago, the Police Department has punished many more officers for a wide range of misconduct, according to police statistics.</p>
        <p>From 1997 through 1999, the number of officers who received serious formal punishments -- officers who were either fired, suspended without pay or who forfeited vacation days for infractions ranging from work-rule violations to excessive force -- has increased by 28 percent, to 450 from 352, according to the statistics.</p>

        <p>Since federal authorities began reviewing the police disciplinary process three years ago, the Police Department has punished many more officers for a wide range of misconduct, according to police statistics.</p>
        <p>From 1997 through 1999, the number of officers who received serious formal punishments -- officers who were either fired, suspended without pay or who forfeited vacation days for infractions ranging from work-rule violations to excessive force -- has increased by 28 percent, to 450 from 352, according to the statistics.</p>
        <p>But while the statistics and a separate analysis by Public Advocate Mark Green show that the overall number of officers being disciplined by the department has increased, the severity of punishments has not, and in fact has dipped in some instances. For example, the number of officers who have been fired dropped to 88 in 1999, from 116 in 1997, and the average number of days forfeited in cases in which disciplinary charges were brought declined to 24.8 last year from 30.1 in 1997.</p>
        <p>The increase in the number of officers who have been punished comes as the department is facing the prospect of a federal monitor or a lawsuit to install one by federal prosecutors. A three-year inquiry by the office of the United States attorney in Brooklyn, prompted by the 1997 station house torture of Abner Louima, found that the department was so lenient with officers in excessive force cases that it had bred a climate that failed to deter brutal acts.</p>
        <p>Police Department officials contend that the significant jump in the number of officers subjected to formal discipline is a result of their increased vigilance and efforts, over four years, to improve the disciplinary process. But critics of the department say the increase is a direct response to the federal investigation, and is an attempt to head off the appointment of a federal monitor.</p>
        <p>The conflicting trends give ballast to both sides in the debate over whether the Police Department's handling of excessive force cases is so flawed that an outside monitor should be appointed to oversee it. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have said their investigation proves that a monitor is necessary, and they have been negotiating the possible appointment of one with the Giuliani administration for more than a year in an effort to forestall a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Police officials point to the increase in the number of officers being punished as evidence of their stronger commitment to discipline, one that they say has had a significant impact. They cite a 25 percent drop last year in the number of legal claims filed against the city that alleged police brutality and a drop in the number of complaints filed against officers with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.</p>
        <p>Patrick E. Kelleher, the department's first deputy commissioner, disagreed with suggestions that the increased discipline was a response to greater outside scrutiny. ''You're not going to reduce civilian complaints overnight,'' he said. ''This is the real world. You can't say, 'O.K., everybody be good.' It took a lot of hard work, a lot of getting the message out. And again, I think the proof is in the pudding.''</p>
        <p>But critics call the increase a short-term show, orchestrated to improve the department's negotiating position and to convince federal prosecutors -- or any judge who might hear a lawsuit -- that the city is correcting any lapses. In fact, the critics say, the leniency in punishment over the last three years continues to demonstrate that the department does not have a commitment to discipline officers in excessive force cases and that only institutional and structural change under the oversight of a monitor can change the department's culture.</p>
        <p>The overall disciplinary statistics, provided in response to a request by The New York Times for the period the department was under federal scrutiny, cover a variety of misconduct, including discourtesy, insubordination, abusive language and excessive force, but do not separate out excessive force figures. As such, it is unclear whether there has been an increase in the number of officers punished for using excessive force.</p>
        <p>The report by Mr. Green concluded that despite the recent increase in the number of officers disciplined, the department's disciplinary process was plagued by ''systemic failure.''</p>
        <p>Based on a review of cases of police misconduct substantiated against 664 officers, Mr. Green said he found that 75 percent of the officers disciplined received insignificant penalties that he characterized as a ''slap on the wrist.'' Those punishments, he said, consisted of discipline like a reprimand from a superior, a note in an officer's file or the loss of a few vacation days.</p>
        <p>''What we found is a Police Department that fights crime well, but fights police misconduct far less well,'' said Mr. Green, who is expected to run for mayor in 2001, at a news conference yesterday. ''What we found is mismanagement at the top of the Police Department which refuses to acknowledge the extent of police misconduct, refuses to punish it adequately, refuses to adopt available and successful reforms and, as bad, tolerates a police culture more likely to wink at than really punish police abuse.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's 147-page report was based on a review of Police Department records of disciplinary cases brought in response to cases of misconduct substantiated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board between 1997 and 1999. The board, which is independent of the Police Department, investigates complaints of police abuse that do not rise to the level of a crime.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dismissed Mr. Green's report, calling it  partisan and saying that it glossed over what the mayor characterized as the department's significant achievements.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Kelleher said that the efforts of Commissioner Howard Safir had raised the discipline rate and had helped send a message to officers that misconduct would not be tolerated. Making commanders responsible for rising civilian complaints against their subordinates, in the same way they are held responsible for increases in reported crimes, has also helped drive down the level of misconduct, he said.</p>
        <p>''I think the discipline is strong, I think it's fair, I think it's consistent,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But one official familiar with the police disciplinary process said the issues were broader than changes in the number of officers disciplined.</p>
        <p>''You're talking about a decrease for the first time after several years of a very stark pattern of increases in excessive force complaints and several years of a well-established pattern of inadequate discipline,'' the official said. ''Is it a short-term phenomenon by virtue of the fact that the heat is on and the spotlight is on, or does this reflect a long term commitment to change their ways?''</p>
