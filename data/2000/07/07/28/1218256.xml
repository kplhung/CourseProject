        <p>G.O.P. Easing Stands, But Not on Abortion  The proposed Republican platform would drop several of the more hard-edged conservative positions adopted four years ago -- like calling for the abolition of the Department of Education -- and transform much of the document's tone to reflect the ''compassionate conservatism'' of Gov. George W. Bush. But it also retains the call for a ban on abortion with no exceptions and the appointment of judges who ''respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.''</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney continued to respond to questions about his conservative voting record, and Gov. George W. Bush defended his running mate.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Pentagon to Put On a Show  Despite a policy barring military involvement in politics, members of Congress and guests at the Republican National Convention will have an exclusive viewing of some of the Pentagon's latest hardware, including the the V-22 Osprey, above, which Dick Cheney opposed developing when he was defense secretary.</p>
        <p>A15</p>
        <p>The Marines said two pilots of an Osprey would be disciplined for actions contributing to the fatal crash of a companion Osprey in April.</p>

        <p>No Indictment of Officer In Killing of Unarmed Man  A grand jury declined to file criminal charges against the undercover narcotics detective who fatally shot Patrick M. Dorismond, left, an off-duty, unarmed security guard, in Midtown. The Manhattan district attorney said jurors had concluded that the killing was not intentional. Federal prosecutors are reviewing the case.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Since federal authorities began reviewing the police disciplinary process three years ago, the department has punished many more officers for a wide range of misconduct.</p>
