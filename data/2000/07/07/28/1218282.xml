        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your July 26 front-page article  about Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney as his running mate:</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush were the fiscal conservative he claims to be, he should have suggested that the office of vice president be abolished.</p>
        <p>Although our country has been fortunate to have had a highly qualified vice president in Al Gore serving us in recent years, the reality is this: the office has no legal responsibilities other than to preside over the Senate. And those duties could easily be assumed by the Senate majority leader.</p>
        <p>If the president is unable to complete his term, I think that the senior member of the Senate from the president's party should assume the duties of the president and complete the term of office.</p>
        <p>The office of vice president is not needed. Let's change the Constitution!</p>
