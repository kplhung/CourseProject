        <p>With new, tantalizing evidence of possible running water on Mars in the recent past, NASA has decided to send at least one and perhaps two large robotic roving vehicles to scout the planet's surface for signs of water, past or present.</p>
        <p>Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced yesterday that a spacecraft carrying the rover would be launched in 2003 on a seven-month journey to Mars, arriving in January 2004.

        <p>With new, tantalizing evidence of possible running water on Mars in the recent past, NASA has decided to send at least one and perhaps two large robotic roving vehicles to scout the planet's surface for signs of water, past or present.</p>
        <p>Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced yesterday that a spacecraft carrying the rover would be launched in 2003 on a seven-month journey to Mars, arriving in January 2004. The rover would be a larger, more elaborate version of the Mars Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, that operated for a few weeks on the planet in 1997.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward J. Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science, made the decision to develop a landing craft with a rover for the 2003 Mars mission, instead of flying another spacecraft for making observations from an orbit of the planet. Another orbiter is already being built and is to be launched toward Mars next April.</p>
        <p>In announcing the decision, Dr. Weiler said he was still weighing the possibility of launching a second 2003 rover at the same time. The two vehicles would be sent to widely separated and diverse landing sites, probably a dry lakebed or apparent flood channel. Landing sites are to be selected on the basis of mapping data being gathered by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which has been orbiting the planet since 1997.</p>
        <p>''We want to look into what could be an amazing opportunity, as well as a challenge, by sending two such rovers to two very different locations,'' he said, promising to reach that decision in the next few weeks.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from NASA headquarters in Washington, Scott Hubbard, the agency's Mars program director, said, ''Two landers and rovers have a lot to offer, but we have to do a careful study of the scheduling and budget implications.''</p>
        <p>The new plans for Mars exploration represent NASA's latest effort to recover from two devastating failures of Mars missions last year and take advantage of excitement over new findings by the Mars Global Surveyor, which suggest the presence of reservoirs of liquid water hidden under parts of the dry, cold Martian surface.</p>
        <p>Any hint that Mars had or still has some liquid water provokes thoughts of the planet's harboring some forms of life in the past and possibly even now. Some scientists recently saw in surface markings evidence of possible subsurface liquid water there. Even if this was not supporting Martian life, the presence of water could be a source of oxygen and fuel for human explorers to the planet.</p>
        <p>In studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and Lockheed Martin Astronautics in Denver, engineers came up with a mission plan that resembled the successful Mars Pathfinder landing -- only on a larger scale. The lander would parachute to a bouncing, rolling touchdown on Mars. The rover, weighing about 300 pounds, would constitute nearly all of the payload.</p>
        <p>The new rover would be able to travel about 110 yards each day, almost as far in one Martian day as the Sojourner rover did over its entire lifetime. It should be capable of operating for at least 90 days, until late April 2004, but could prove more durable. Beside testing for signs of water and making geological studies, the rover will send back detailed color and infrared pictures of the surface.</p>
