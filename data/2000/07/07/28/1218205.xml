        <p>Pay no attention to the exhibition football game being played Monday at 7 p.m. on ABC. Ignore Al Michaels's new playmates. Heed not the verbal gyrations of Dennis Miller, who is making his debut as a comedian-turned-sports analyst.</p>
        <p>That's what ABC would like you to do. Go ahead, watch the San Francisco-New England Hall of Fame game, if you can turn away from the Republican National Convention.

        <p>Pay no attention to the exhibition football game being played Monday at 7 p.m. on ABC. Ignore Al Michaels's new playmates. Heed not the verbal gyrations of Dennis Miller, who is making his debut as a comedian-turned-sports analyst.</p>
        <p>That's what ABC would like you to do. Go ahead, watch the San Francisco-New England Hall of Fame game, if you can turn away from the Republican National Convention. But mute the sound, lest ye judge the new ''Monday Night Football'' configuration before Michaels and Dan Fouts -- who is cast as the traditional analyst but forgotten amid the tsunami of Miller hype -- determine when best to interrupt a Miller stream-of-thought that connects Jerry Rice to Rice-A-Roni and Joe Montana to Montana Wildhack, the exotic dancer of ''Slaughterhouse-Five.''</p>
        <p>But there is no way for the new ''Monday Night Football'' crew to hide once it's on the air. With the producer Don Ohlmeyer and the sideline reporters Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson, the three lead announcers recently underwent intensive studio training to mimic game conditions.</p>
        <p>But in Canton, Ohio, on Monday, the cone of silence will be lifted, and Ohlmeyer's grand plan will be unveiled.</p>
        <p>In 1970, when ''Monday Night Football'' was a rookie, the first exhibition game uniting Howard Cosell, Don Meredith and Keith Jackson was not televised by ABC because it was deemed practice only by Roone Arledge, then the president of ABC Sports. ''It was terrible in all regards,'' said Dennis Lewin, who ran the game's replay unit and is now the senior vice president for broadcasting of the National Football League.</p>
        <p>''Keith, Howard and Don hadn't figured out their roles very well, and afterward, Don was ready to quit,'' Lewin added. ''And in the replay unit, our mission was to find exciting angles, but we were so focused on that that we didn't find any angles for regular analysis.''</p>
        <p>A second exhibition game, which was televised, was more successful.</p>
        <p>''They're way ahead of where we were in 1970,'' Lewin said. ''Ohlmeyer auditioned people before hiring Dennis and Dan. Roone just picked Keith, Howard and Don. Hopefully, they'll be closer to where we were during our second game, not our first.''</p>
        <p>Still, the Michaels-Miller-Fouts crew will not have the luxury of buying a terrible first broadcast. Scrutiny of the inspired and risky decision to hire Miller will begin Monday. Wait until October to judge the new announcing team, as ABC hopes? You might as well resist thinking of the next person to be tossed off ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Miller's football knowledge will be analyzed in July as if it were October. His chemistry with Michaels and Fouts will be probed for signs of tension and electricity. The time of Miller's first rant will be marked and the number of his obscure references and tangents counted.</p>
        <p>On a Hall of Fame weekend, can Miller resist making caustic references to O. J. Simpson, a former ''Monday Nighter'' who this week launched a new Internet campaign to explain his innocence of murder charges and whose 1973 single-season rushing record was eclipsed in 1984 by Dickerson, a TV neophyte but a 1999 Hall inductee?</p>
        <p>But most importantly, this debut may determine how viewers begin to judge Miller: must he be funny every time he opens his mouth -- a difficult task for any comedian -- and how different from Fouts's traditional analysis must Miller's be for him to be judged acceptable?</p>
        <p>''I can comment on a team and tell what I think are the strengths and weaknesses,'' Miller said recently at a news conference for reporters covering the television industry. ''I just don't want to convey that I'm going to be the court jester out there.''</p>
        <p>The ''Monday Night Football'' game will inaugurate the N.F.L.'s preseason experiment with using tiny cameras mounted on the bills of the umpires' caps to offer viewers a vicarious look at on-field action. Another preseason test will allow the networks to interview a player as he leaves the field at halftime. It adds to an existing policy of interviewing a coach as he leaves the field at the half.</p>
        <p>Is this the dawn of a new and liberal league, ready to junk the ''No Fun League'' nickname? Will the league soon let players wear their socks where they want? Will it allow sideline reporters to hang with the coaches?</p>
        <p>''We're trying to be more reactive to where we see changes in technology and changes in viewer interest,'' Lewin said. But he insisted that the changes were not instituted to compete with the perceived wide-openness of the XFL, the World Wrestling Federation-NBC football league that is to start play in February.</p>
        <p>''We're not in a position of reacting to what hasn't started yet,'' Lewin said. ''But is it possible that they will do something that we think is great? That's possible.''</p>
        <p>The ''umpcam'' was employed in two N.F.L. Europe games, and experienced some transmission and picture problems. ''But there's a lot of potential there, so we said, 'Let's try it in the preseason,' '' Lewin said.</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports, met yesterday with Paul Beeston, the president of Major League Baseball, to discuss buying one of the sport's network packages. Fox and NBC balked at renewing their deals at triple the current rates; CBS isn't hungry enough to jump at such a high price. . . . The Fox Sports Net's ''Regional Sports Report'' makes its premiere Monday at 11 p.m. on Fox Sports New York. Watch for whether Samantha Ryan and Bob Wischusen, the anchors, try to bond with viewers by referring to local teams as ''we,'' a trap some ''Regional'' anchors at other Fox Sports Net channels have fallen into.</p>
