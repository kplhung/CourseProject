        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>RON AFFIF TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. This is for anyone who isn't connected to the jazz-guitar circuit or who doesn't hang out on Monday nights on Houston Street, where Mr. Affif and his band have played at the Zinc Bar for years. Mr. Affif is a tough, intensely rhythmic player, and the relationship he has developed with the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts, one of the most important drummers in late-century jazz, is special. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $17.50 Sunday and $20 tonight and tomorrow; $10 minimum (Ben Ratliff).</p>

        <p>* AFRERICA, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Band Shell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. Clumsy name aside, Afrerica is a marathon show of African pop full of sunny three-chord grooves. The headliner is Les Go, a cosmopolitan three-woman group from the Ivory Coast that harmonizes over pan-African rhythms. It also includes Afro-Cuban (or maybe Cubo-African) music of Ricardo Lemvo and Makina Loca, an African salsa band that updates the long-running connection between Cuban and Congolese rumba; Nigerian-style juju from a Brooklyn band, Kofo the Wonderman and Daylight Stars, and the Kotchegna Dance Company, from the Ivory Coast, which includes stilt dancers. Sunday, beginning at 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.; admission is free, with a $3 donation requested (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>JOANNE BRACKEEN QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. A pianist with a long and undervalued history -- she had a stint with Art Blakey's band in the late 60's, though not many know it -- Ms. Brackeen plays with gusto. Her stock in trade is the refreshing, witty composition with nonstandard chord changes and shifting arrangements. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight, with a $25 cover; Sunday sets are at 7 and 9 p.m., with an $18 cover; $10 minimum all nights (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CARAMOOR JAZZ FESTIVAL, Katonah, N.Y., (914) 232-1252. A great day of jazz by any standards, and one that, in its non-attention-getting manner, is indicative of where the inventive mainstream is right now; one wonders why New York's enormous jazz festivals don't have bills like this. Music is tomorrow from 2 to 10 p.m., and acts, in this order, are two duets, between the pianist Frank Kimbrough and the vibraphonist Joe Locke, and  between the multi-instrumentalist Yusef Lateef and the percussionist Adam Rudolph; the vibraphonist Stefon Harris's band; the Jackie McLean quartet, with Gary Bartz as guest soloist; and the indefatigable Cuban virtuoso pianist Chucho Valdes. Tickets are $40; take lunch and enjoy it in the Westchester estate's beautiful gardens (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CHOCOLATE GENIUS, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Marc Anthony Thompson, a k a Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. He has a husky voice and a band that can put a subtle jazz swing into his twilit ballads. Tonight at 9; no cover, $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* RAVI COLTRANE QUARTET, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. With a slightly mumbling, affectless tenor saxophone style, Mr. Coltrane plays tunes built on small syncopated rhythmic motifs. Happily, he sounds nothing like his father, John Coltrane, and when his band is at its best, you never quite know where the music is going. He'll be playing music from a new RCA album, ''From the Round Box.'' Sets through Sunday are at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., with midnight sets tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE DELTA 72, KNOXVILLE GIRLS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Punks who started out demolishing roots music now prove they have a right to play it. The Delta 72 has matured into a full-fledged purveyor of wild garage soul; why even say it has a punk edge? The music just rocks. Knoxville Girls features several patriarchs of New York scum rock getting bloody on murder ballads and covers of Shangri-Las tunes. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $10 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. This long-running Texas blues band includes Jimmie Vaughan, Stevie Ray's brother, on guitar; he puts the sting behind Kim Wilson's smoothly long-suffering vocals. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7 and 10:30. Seats at tables are $30; standing room at the bar is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* RACHELLE FERRELL, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Ms. Ferrell has stylistic range as well as enormous pitch range: she sings jazz and rhythm-and-blues and gospel and all three at once. And she can be shocking when she changes gears from easy sensuality to really freaking out on an audience. Her shows can be fascinating displays of virtuosity -- overkill, at times. But her ruthless talent seems to tell her what to do, and as an audience member you end up not wanting someone with this sort of extravagant gift to rein herself in. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $35; $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>THE FOR CARNATION, DAVID GRUBBS, TWO MULE TEAM, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The For Carnation's songs sound like someone thinking aloud: quiet, mumbly, sparse and obstinately unconcerned with the effect on anyone else. David Grubbs, who has been involved in avant-rock groups including Gastr del Sol and Red Krayola, performs solo with guitar and electronics. Two Mule Team is the debut of the latest, mostly instrumental, mostly improvised project by Rick Brown and Sue Garner, who have been exploring rock's fringes for some time. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $10 in advance. $12 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BERES HAMMOND, ANTHONY B. WITH NORRISMAN, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777. Romance, consciousness-raising and slinky roots-reggae grooves run through this concert. Beres Hammond woos listeners with his yearning tenor; Anthony B. toasts (raps) and sings about destiny, struggle and perseverance, joined by another determined positive thinker, Norrisman. Sunday at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* KALI, BEETHOVA OBAS, CHRIS COMBETTE, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5928. The Caribbean has been a laboratory of cultural creolization -- the mixing and synthesis of ideas from indigenous people, European colonizers, African slaves. and whatever trade and radio can bring in. This concert, which winds up the Lincoln Center Festival's series ''Caribbean Roots: Caribbean Routes,'' is a showcase of socially conscious songwriters who are local heroes on French-speaking islands, slipping thoughtful messages into lilting dance tunes. Kali, from Martinique, plays banjo and mixes Martinican traditions -- carnival music and biguine -- with soca and reggae. Beethova Obas, from Haiti, uses the rhythms of Haitian rara and compas, adding touches of bossa nova. Chris Combette -- born in French Guyana, reared on Martinique and now living in French Guyana -- was a sideman for Kali and others before starting a solo career; he gives Martinique's modern dance music, zouk, a gentle clarity. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $25 and $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LES GO, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston, SoHo, (212) 243-4940. Les Go, a three-woman group from the Ivory Coast, puts its harmonies to cosmopolitan use. The group has a Pan-African vocabulary of grooves, from quick Senegalese mbalax to bouncy South African accordion music to rumba; it also has a Hall and Oates song translated into French and Mandingo. Tonight at 10; admission is $18 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* CHRIS LIGHTCAP QUARTET, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9318. A well-rounded young bassist, Mr. Lightcap leads a two-tenor band that gets ferocious within a free-jazz-and-motifs style; luckily, both tenor saxophonists, Bill McHenry and Tony Malaby, are musicians with much more to offer than pure energy. The band's first record, ''Lay-Up'' (Fresh Sound), is one of the year's winners so far. Sets are tomorrow night at 9; admission is $10 plus a one-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ROGER MCGUINN, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. One of folk-rock's founding fathers as the leader of the Byrds, Roger McGuinn plugged in an electric 12-string guitar for songs by Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger, and Top 40 was never the same; then he turned to country-rock. He's bound to riffle through his back pages onstage; expect ''Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ''Chestnut Mare.'' Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; doors open at 6; admission is $30 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* SUSAN MCKEOWN AND CHANTING HOUSE, LUNASA, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Band Shell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. Susan McKeown, a Dubliner who now lives in New York, leads the Chanting House, putting her forthright and unmistakably Celtic singing atop arrangements that stretch a long way from Ireland. Lunasa is a speed-fingered traditionalist Irish group that gives the old jigs and reels a fierce workout. Tonight at 7:30; admission is free, with a $3 donation requested (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MY LIFE WITH THE THRILL KILL KULT, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Even nihilists love show business, and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult is happy to provide it, with shimmying women, booming industrial beats and lyrics that relish images of sex and violence. Sunday at 9 p.m., with the Nuns and Meg Lee Chin opening; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DAVID (FATHEAD) NEWMAN QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Newman, the saxophonist, is one of the figures who led jazz toward pop in the 60's, as Ray Charles's right-hand man in that band's greatest years and a maker of consistent solo records for Atlantic. He has maintained his smoothness. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow; $15 on Sunday; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>OGANS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston, SoHo, (212) 243-4940. Ogans is a Bahia-style group of nearly a dozen drummers generating a parade beat that swings and struts. Its booming rhythm carries old and new hits that have Brazilians in the crowd singing along. Tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 1; admission is $20. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>RHYTHM OF LOVE SUMMER TOUR, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. If you like your summer music smooth and a little fruity, with hints of mahogany, you will be drunk with delight at this smooth soul lovefest. Will Downing has earned kudos from sophisticates for his dulcet singing. Gerald Albright is a saxophonist who has collaborated with Mr. Downing in the studio. The songbird Chante Moore and the crooner Phil Perry round out the evening. Tonight at 8; tickets are $30 to $55 (Powers).</p>
        <p>SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disc-jockey partnership of Sasha and John Digweed. In their marathon sets of trance music, steady repetition holds time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Tonight; doors open at 11 p.m., with Sean Cusick warming up and John Digweed and Sasha continuing well past dawn. Admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* ANGIE STONE, DONALD LAWRENCE AND THE TRI-CITY SINGERS, Central Park Summerstage, Rumsey Playfield, midpark at 70th Street, (212) 360-2777. The divine Ms. Stone, who is putting the gospel back into rhythm-and-blues with a mighty thunderbolt, meets a real gospel choir on a double bill that should open the heavens (but with luck not for rain!). Big sounds and big emotions should fit right in at the big park at this show. Tomorrow at 3 p.m.; admission is free (Powers).</p>
        <p>THE TEA PARTY WITH TRACIE MORRIS, Celebrate Brooklyn, Prospect Park Band Shell, Prospect Park West and Ninth Street, Park Slope, (718) 855-7882, extension 45. The Tea Party, a collective of disc jockeys, rappers, musicians and dancers, shares a bill with Tracie Morris, a spoken-word performer whose reflections on identity and social issues are both smart and highly musical. Tomorrow at 6:30 p.m.; admission is free, with a $3 donation requested (Pareles).</p>
        <p>THIRD EYE BLIND, VERTICAL HORIZON, Jones Beach, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000; PNC Bank Arts Center, Garden State Parkway, exit 117, Holmdel, N.J., (732) 335-0400. Stylishly obnoxious and smarter than his hits let on at first listen, Stephan Jenkins is one of those pop stars critics generally hate. But even those who insult his band Third Eye Blind's sweet-tart sound have to admit that the songs stick in the brain, bratty lyrics and all. Vertical Horizon is a jangly folk outfit with an intriguingly masochistic summer hit, ''Everything You Want.'' The KGB also performs. Tonight at 7:30 at Jones Beach; tickets are $19 and $29. Tomorrow at 7:30 at PNC Bank Arts Center; tickets are $22.75 and $28.75 (Powers)</p>
        <p>* ''TRADEWINDS OF TRINIDAD: PARANG AND INDO-CALYPSO JAZZ,'' Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500. The sitarist Mungal Patasar and his band Pantar blend jazz, steel-pan music, Indian music, electronica and reggae; they reflect the heavy Indian influence in Trinidad, but they're also self-consciously fusing cultures anew. And the San Jose Serenaders play parang, a kind of Caribbean-Hispanic (via Venezuelan immigrants) religious music for the Christmas season. The concert, part of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, is tonight at 9; tickets are $20 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DIONNE WARWICK, THE SPINNERS, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. With a velvety voice that holds gospel fervor in reserve, Dionne Warwick makes songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David sound easy, even with melody lines that hop all over the place (like ''Walk On By'' or ''I Say a Little Prayer'') and words that have to be articulated just so. The Spinners, sharing the bill, carried close harmony into the disco era with hits like ''I'll Be Around'' and ''Could It Be I'm Falling in Love.'' Sunday at 7 p.m.; tickets are $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>HANK WILLIAMS 3d, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The grandson of country music's patron pagan saint has a split personality. Yes, he can twang in hard country style, but he'd just as soon thrash with the punk rockers. He is reported to be touring with Duane Denison, formerly the guitarist for the Jesus Lizard, so expect to bang your head in your cowboy hat. With Joe Coffee and the Hissy Fits. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; admission is $12 (Powers).</p>
