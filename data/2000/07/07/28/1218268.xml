        <p>California and the six other Western states that rely on water from the Colorado River have reached the outlines of an agreement that would let California gradually reduce its over-dependence on the river through extensive conservation and underground storage measures during the next 15 years, officials here said today.</p>
        <p>For years, California, long the region's water hog, has drawn more than its legal share of Colorado River water, the region's most precious resource, largely because less populous states like Arizona and Nevada did not need their full allocation. But with explosive growth in Phoenix and Las Vegas, the other states and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt have issued stern warnings that California must learn to live with its allotment of 4.4 million acre-feet of water a year. An acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre of land a foot deep in water, about 326,000 gallons.</p>
        <p>''It's a promising step,'' Jack Lavelle, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said of today's announcement. ''It's a coming together after so many years of dueling philosophies.''</p>
        <p>The outline, agreed to last week and presented to Deputy Interior Secretary David Hayes in Washington today, is intended to give California what officials describe as a ''soft landing'' -- gradually reduced consumption instead of a sharp cutoff. California has been allowed to draw more than its share because the interior secretary has declared annual surpluses in water levels in the river. But in expected future years of drought, the situation could be dicey.</p>
        <p>A key point of agreement was how far Lake Mead, the reservoir 60 miles south of Las Vegas, could be drawn down in time of drought.</p>
        <p>California had proposed to draw Lake Mead down more than 110 feet in the worst case, a level that could make the shoreline recede as much as two miles in some areas. The states agreed to allow a level of about 75 feet, said Jan Matusak, a principal engineer for the Metropolitan Water District, which owns the aqueduct that carries Colorado River water to 16 million residents of Southern California.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for water agencies in Southern California, where agricultural users have historically had first rights to the water, to cut consumption by lining earthen canals with concrete and adopting new underground storage techniques, so conserved water can be passed on to urban users.</p>
        <p>Final agreement on the overall plan is expected to take many more months of negotiation and reworking the voluminous laws governing use of the river.</p>
