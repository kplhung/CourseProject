        <p>As he made the rounds of the television talk shows this morning, Dick Cheney confidently defended his votes in the 1980's against gun control, abortion rights and education spending, but he slipped when he tried to justify his opposition to an obscure resolution in 1986 that called on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.</p>
        <p>Democrats immediately pounced on the issue and vowed to use it against the Republican ticket in the fall campaign.</p>
        <p>On NBC's ''Today,'' Mr. Cheney, the expected Republican vice-presidential nominee, said his vote was based on a disagreement over whether economic sanctions were the best way to end apartheid.</p>
        <p>''The debate that we had at the time had to do with how we could best pursue our policies in South Africa,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''Nobody supported apartheid. We were all against it. But there was a big debate over the best leverage we could use to get Nelson Mandela free.</p>
        <p>''One school of thought said that there should be sanctions imposed on South Africa, that American companies should be prohibited from operating in South Africa, that there shouldn't be any trade with South Africa. The other school of thought said, 'Wait a minute,' that, in fact, the only good jobs that were available to black South Africans were with American firms. If you wanted a company that was going to provide opportunities and not discriminate, you had to go to American firms, and the people that would be hurt if we forced American firms out of South Africa were those very people we were trying to help.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney then said, ''This notion that somehow I was opposed to freeing Nelson Mandela is a typical Al Gore distortion of a record, a point he's trying to make because he doesn't want to talk about real issues.''</p>
        <p>The disagreement over sanctions was a big issue in Congress in 1986, and Mr. Cheney's description of the two sides was accurate. Before the year was out, Congress overrode President Ronald Reagan's veto of a bill that imposed sanctions, the first time Mr. Reagan had been rebuffed like this on a foreign policy matter. Mr. Cheney supported the president.</p>
        <p>But the question of sanctions never came up in the debate on the Mandela resolution. The opposition to it was based on the belief of the right wing of the Republican Party in the House that the African National Congress, Mr. Mandela's party and the leading political voice against apartheid, was dominated by Communists.</p>
        <p>Representative Dan Burton of Indiana said: ''Let us look at the A.N.C. and see what it consists of exactly. Nineteen of the 30 members of the A.N.C. are known members of the South African Communist Party, and we believe as many as 26.''</p>
        <p>Democratic strategists said today they expected to use the Mandela vote against the Republicans this fall, particularly in commercials on radio stations popular with blacks.</p>
        <p>''George W. Bush has now said to the African-American community, 'I give you my person, my candidate for vice president, and my person said no to Nelson Mandela when he was in prison,' '' said Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>The 1986 resolution was nonbinding. The House debated it for less than an hour, and it was defeated, 245 to 177, shy of the 282 votes needed for a two-thirds majority.</p>
        <p>On the vote, 215 Democrats and 30 Republicans were in favor; 32 Democrats and 145 Republicans, including Mr. Cheney, were opposed.</p>
