        <p>These days home video is especially keen on its own progeny: those feature-length films, animated and live action, that go straight to cassette and disc without playing in theaters. Not that there has been too much of a critical sea change. Direct-to-video movies still couldn't be any good, or so goes the view even of most video dealers, who regard a movie's record on the big screen as vital to its appeal at home.</p>
        <p>Now, though, huge amounts of money have broadened the outlook. Big direct-to-video movies like ''American Tail 4: The Mystery of the Night Monster,'' released this week by Universal, are bought by the millions of copies. Obviously they have to meet certain standards, but film criticism per se is essentially beside the point. It is much more important that the movie fit a mold and take its place in a series.</p>

        <p>These days home video is especially keen on its own progeny: those feature-length films, animated and live action, that go straight to cassette and disc without playing in theaters. Not that there has been too much of a critical sea change. Direct-to-video movies still couldn't be any good, or so goes the view even of most video dealers, who regard a movie's record on the big screen as vital to its appeal at home.</p>
        <p>Now, though, huge amounts of money have broadened the outlook. Big direct-to-video movies like ''American Tail 4: The Mystery of the Night Monster,'' released this week by Universal, are bought by the millions of copies. Obviously they have to meet certain standards, but film criticism per se is essentially beside the point. It is much more important that the movie fit a mold and take its place in a series.</p>
        <p>''The real key is to expand the franchises,'' said Ken Graffeo, Universal's senior vice president for marketing. Video movies are numbered: for example, the live-action ''Beethoven's 3rd,'' also released this week, the animated ''Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire'' (coming this fall) and the live-action ''Dragonheart 2: A New Beginning,'' to be released Aug. 8.</p>
        <p>Historically, direct-to-video has leaned toward the exploitational. Now it has become a highly lucrative assembly line of brand-name movies that are relatively cheaply produced and often bland as vanilla for the family audience.</p>
        <p>Disney fanned the direct-to-video fires in the 1990's with ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' and ''The Return of Jafar,'' which despite its lack of a numeral was the sequel to ''Aladdin.'' The two films, made at a fraction of the cost of the big-screen originals, are said to have brought in a total of $500 million. Released in 1994, Universal's ''Land Before Time 2: The Great Valley Adventure'' kicked off a series of video sequels that has made $1 billion worldwide.</p>
        <p>Are they good films? Critics jumped fairly hard on the two Disney sequels, but that could have been expected, given the illustrious reputations of their predecessors. Actually, the best direct-to-video sequels have good to excellent production values and are otherwise competent enough for what they do: please children, prime the cash cow and perpetuate the line.</p>
        <p>''Beethoven's 3rd'' is an example. A sappy, squeaky-clean tale of mom, dad, sis and junior and the sloppy St. Bernard that goes along on their vacation, the film gets the job done for the average 8-year-old. ''Beethoven 4'' is currently in production. (The real Beethoven got up to nine, remember.)</p>
        <p>This fall Dreamworks will edge into direct-to-video for the first time with ''Joseph: King of Dreams,'' an animated film based on the biblical story of the favored son sold into slavery by his envious brothers. The studio emphasizes that it is not a sequel or part of a series. It also points out that viewers might make a connection with ''Prince of Egypt,'' the studio's successful big-screen feature last year, and that many of the same people worked on both movies.</p>
        <p>Will those be associations enough? Dreamworks is promoting ''Joseph'' as if it were a theater release. ''Start six months out to get a buzz,'' said Kelley Avery, the studio's head of video.</p>
