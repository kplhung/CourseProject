        <p>A Manhattan jury yesterday convicted a young New Jersey man of murdering his former girlfriend, a Columbia University law student found in her apartment with her throat slashed in 1998.</p>
        <p>As the jury foreman read the verdict -- guilty of second-degree murder -- the mother and sister of the victim, Hyseung Linda Hong, cried out in relief, wept and held each other.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Edmund Ko, 26, remained impassive, his face as blank as it had been throughout the seven-week trial. As Mr. Ko was handcuffed and led away, the court officer following him carried the Victor Hugo novel that Mr. Ko had been reading throughout the trial: ''Les Miserables.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ko could face 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced by Justice Harold B. Beeler of State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Sept. 18. Mr. Ko's lawyer, Jack Litman, said he planned to appeal the verdict.</p>
        <p>The relatives of the victim and the defendant, both affluent Korean families from New Jersey, sat on opposite sides of the courtroom during the trial. Ms. Hong's parents held back tears as pictures of their daughter with her throat slashed were shown to jurors.</p>
        <p>After the verdict yesterday, Ms. Hong's sister Amy said, ''We're delighted with the verdict, but it doesn't erase the fact that our sister will never be with us and our pain will never diminish.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ko's mother and his father, a wealthy executive from Cliffside Park, N.J., held hands and were expressionless as the verdict was announced.</p>
        <p>The jury of seven women and five men women deliberated for 12 hours over two days.</p>
        <p>The case presented against Mr. Ko by Ann Prunty, an assistant district attorney, included circumstantial evidence. The night she was murdered, Ms. Hong, 26, told a friend on the telephone that Mr. Ko was coming to visit. In addition, the killer appeared to be well-acquainted with her apartment, and the authorities said bloody clothes linked to Mr. Ko were found at the scene.</p>
        <p>But there was little forensic evidence linking Mr. Ko directly to the murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Litman, the defense lawyer, tried to cast doubt that Mr. Ko was the murderer by pointing to another former girlfriend, a woman named Claudia Seong who, he said, might have counseled Mr. Ko in a jealous rage to shun or even attack former girlfriends, including Ms. Hong.</p>
        <p>While prosecutors agreed that Ms. Seong, 34, might have incited Mr. Ko to murder Ms. Hong as a way to prove his devotion, they argued that he acted alone.</p>
        <p>Detective Roberty Mooney of the Manhattan North Homicide Squad, who worked on the case, said of Ms. Seong after the verdict, ''If we could prove a case against her -- and we have not stopped trying -- we would.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Ko's family filed from the courtroom yesterday, his father told reporters that Ms. Seong was responsible for the trouble his son was in.  ''My son is not the type of a young boy who can kill someone,'' he said.  ''He didn't have any criminal record during the high school and university days.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Seong's role in Ms. Hong's murder haunted the trial, the jury did not hear her testify: on the stand, she invoked the Fifth Amendment 37 times.</p>
        <p>But another ex-girlfriend of Mr. Ko's gave vivid testimony about Ms. Seong's alarming power over him.  Diane Kim, 26, said that Ms. Seong had violently slashed her on her scalp, face and legs as Mr. Ko helped hold her down on a barren New Jersey road in November of 1997, four months before Ms. Hong was killed. Ms. Seong, her younger sister and Mr. Ko face charges in that attack.</p>
        <p>While that testimony bolstered the defense's argument that Ms. Seong might have killed Ms. Hong, it also seemed to show the jury that Mr. Ko was capable of participating in terrible violence.</p>
        <p>Throughout the trial, Mr. Litman also tried to cast doubt on the integrity of evidence against Mr. Ko, arguing that the police planted blood from the scene on a knife in Mr. Ko's parents' apartment and several hairs on clothing sent to an F.B.I. crime laboratory.</p>
        <p>After the verdict, Ms. Hong's sister lambasted his approach, saying, ''No matter how much Mr. Litman tried to use his defense tactics, people in this day and age are not as stupid as he thinks.'' She added of Mr. Ko's case: ''We were not concerned. The evidence against him was tremendous.''</p>
        <p>During its 12 hours of deliberations, jurors asked to see a report on a partial handprint that was left at the scene, most likely to compare it with Mr. Ko's, which was part of the evidence.</p>
        <p>Even after the jurors had notified the judge that they had reached a verdict, Mr. Litman unsuccessfully tried to introduce last-minute forensic evidence, a new handprint of Mr. Ko's, made by a different method, that he said was crucial proof of his innocence.</p>
        <p>But an assistant district attorney, Lisa Friel, protested, saying, ''The trial is over,'' and Justice Beeler ordered that the jury be brought in.</p>
