        <p>A grand jury has declined to file criminal charges against the undercover narcotics detective who fatally shot Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, during a desperate, two-minute brawl in March in front of a Midtown Manhattan bar, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M.

        <p>A grand jury has declined to file criminal charges against the undercover narcotics detective who fatally shot Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, during a desperate, two-minute brawl in March in front of a Midtown Manhattan bar, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said the grand jury decided not to indict the detective, Anthony Vasquez, after concluding that the shooting -- a bullet fired from a 9-millimeter pistol, at a range so close that the barrel was touching Mr. Dorismond's clothing -- was not intentional.</p>
        <p>The jurors also heard evidence that Mr. Dorismond had thrown the first punch as a dispute with three detectives escalated into disorder, and that Mr. Dorismond had seized and was twisting Detective Vasquez's shooting hand when the gun fired, said Mr. Morgenthau, who released a summary of his office's investigation. [Excerpts, Page B6.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorismond, the son of Haitian immigrants and the father of two young daughters, was the fourth unarmed black man to die at the hands of the police during a 13-month period. His death created a public uproar and became an issue in the race for the United States Senate before Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bowed out.</p>
        <p>It came just weeks after the acquittal of officers who had killed another unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo, and Mr. Giuliani, who called  Mr. Dorismond no ''altar boy'' even as the investigation was just starting, was widely criticized for allowing police officials to release the dead man's juvenile criminal record and for failing to meet with his family. The controversy intensified after protestors clashed violently with the police at Mr. Dorismond's funeral.</p>
        <p>Politics aside, the case also brought scrutiny on the risks inherent in police buy-and-bust operations, in which teams of undercover detectives randomly approach people on the street and try to buy drugs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorismond, 26, was not a drug dealer. He had completed a shift as a 34th Street Partnership security guard an hour and a half before he died. To police critics and to Mr. Dorismond's family, his death was a symbol of a department whose aggressive tactics and appetite for ever-climbing arrest statistics caused detectives to draw a young man into a scuffle that led to his killing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenthau's office exercises considerable control over the grand jury process, including the evidence heard and the charges considered, and he acknowledged the political tension surrounding the case yesterday. But the district attorney said the jurors had acted conscientiously and fairly after reviewing 42 exhibits and hearing from 24 witnesses, including Detective Vasquez, during a four-week session.</p>
        <p>He urged the public to accept its decision. ''Some people may be disappointed that this investigation has not resulted in an indictment,'' he said. ''I understand that.''</p>
        <p>He quickly added: ''The grand jury is not a forum for the expression of political views or the resolution of policy disputes. To allow it to be used for those purposes would simply layer an injustice upon a tragedy.''</p>
        <p>Detective Vasquez, 30, who could still face departmental discipline or federal charges in the shooting, could not be reached for comment last night. His lawyer, Philip Karasyk, issued a brief statement and then said that Detective Vasquez felt as if ''a tremendous weight has been lifted from his and his family's shoulders.''</p>
        <p>''There is no joy in this decision,''  he said. ''Only relief.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Karasyk also expressed hope that the city and its police force could now find common ground and mutual respect. That seemed unlikely, as critics vowed to organize protests immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorismond's mother, Marie Rose Dorismond, and his father, Andre Dorismond, assailed the grand jury's decision yesterday at an angry news conference with the Rev. Al Sharpton. Alternately sobbing and shouting, his mother called on God and President Clinton for help and  suggested the shooting had racist overtones. The three detectives involved in the drug sting are Hispanic. Mr. Dorismond was black.</p>
        <p>''Help me, God,'' she said. ''Why did you create me black? Look at me, I'm suffering now.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that Mr. Morgenthau's summary of the investigation suggested that the police had acted almost without fault. ''It is pretty hard to read this report and find something to criticize the police officers for,'' he said. ''I think they were acting under a very, very difficult set of circumstances. I think it is clear from the report, and the report says quite clearly, that the aggressor was Mr. Dorismond.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, speaking in a calm, almost restrained voice, offered condolences to the Dorismond family and later said the shooting was a tragedy for all involved.</p>
        <p>''I have great sympathy for his family,'' he said. ''But I also have great sympathy for the police officers who were put through what is a horrible experience, in which their jobs, their liberties, their careers were put in jeopardy and they will continue to be under question and review for some time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenthau's remarks yesterday, and a summary of the case for Police Commissioner Howard Safir that prosecutors released to news organizations, provided the most vivid picture to date of what happened shortly after midnight on March 16.</p>
        <p>According to the prosecutors' report, the commander of the Midtown South Precinct had requested the help of narcotics detectives after reviewing mounting evidence that the Bloods gang was selling crack cocaine on Eighth Avenue between West 34th and West 43rd Streets. And so for two nights, a team -- consisting of Detectives Vasquez, Anderson Moran, and Julio Cruz -- was assigned to the area. Detective Moran posed as a drug buyer. His two peers served as ''ghosts,'' or backups.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenthau said Detective Moran saw Mr. Dorismond and a companion, Kevin Kaiser, standing in front of the Wakamba Cocktail Lounge at 543 Eighth Avenue. Mr. Kaiser has said that Mr. Dorismond was waiting for a taxi. With his ghosts watching, the detective approached Mr. Dorismond and asked him if he had any ''krills,'' street slang for crack cocaine.</p>
        <p>The encounter immediately turned hostile. Mr. Morgenthau said witnesses testified that Mr. Dorismond argued with Detective Moran, using foul language, and advanced on him as the detective backed away. The other two detectives came to Detective Moran's side, Mr. Morgenthau said, and the three men began to walk backward as Mr. Dorismond continued to approach and his friend, Mr. Kaiser, tried to restrain him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenthau described a flash point: Mr. Dorismond broke free from his friend and punched Officer Moran, he said, and the dispute descended into chaos. ''Everyone was swinging fists, pushing and grabbing at each other in a general melee or brawl,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morgenthau said Detective Vasquez told investigators that he heard either Mr. Dorismond or Mr. Kaiser yell ''gun'' or ''get the gun,'' and, believing that the brawl was about to turn into a gunfight, the detective yelled ''police,'' stepped forward and reached into his pants to withdraw a concealed pistol.</p>
        <p>As he did so, Mr. Morgenthau said, Mr. Dorismond grabbed the detective's right hand and the weapon and began twisting. The gun fired, blasting a bullet into the left side of Mr. Dorismond's chest, perforating his aorta and killing him within minutes.</p>
        <p>Detective Vasquez, Mr. Morgethau said, ''did not intentionally pull the trigger, and in fact does not know how the discharge came about.''</p>
        <p>Although yesterday's announcement means that Detective Vasquez will not face state criminal charges, the examination of the shooting is not over, and he remains on modified duty, without a weapon, performing police clerical work. Patrick E. Kelleher, the Police Department's first deputy commissioner, said internal affairs officers would review the evidence to see if he should face administrative charges. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are also investigating the case for possible violations of federal criminal civil rights laws.</p>
