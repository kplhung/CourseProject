        <p>Allen L. Questrom, who headed Federated Department Stores for much of the 1990's and led Barneys New York Inc. out of bankruptcy, was named chairman and chief executive of J. C. Penney today.</p>
        <p>Investors, who have knocked three-quarters of the market value off Penney in the last two years, pushed the stock up 16 percent, betting that Mr. Questrom can lift the sagging fortunes of the company, one of the nation's largest department store chains.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the company has lost focus, losing to nimbler competitors like Kohl's and Target, and has struggled to wrest itself from an insular and plodding culture that left too much power in the hands of store managers. That has led to serious inventory problems, including slow distribution of newer, hot-selling merchandise and overstocked shelves of unpopular products.</p>
        <p>Penney's chief executive, James E. Oesterreicher, who said in May that he would resign, and Vanessa Castagna, the chief operating officer who was hired last year from Wal-Mart Stores, were both considered possible successors at one point.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Questrom, 60, said that he expected to stay at Penney for at least five years, though he is leaving Barneys New York after just over a year. At Barneys New York, Mr. Questrom will remain chairman and help lead a search for a new chief executive. At Penney, he said that he planned to immerse himself in the company's operations for a few months before letting anyone know his plans.</p>
        <p>''I have a lot of impressions, but I hesitate to share those until I get to talk to people,'' Mr. Questrom said.  ''Little companies are nimble, and as they get larger, they have to go back and refocus.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said they expected Mr. Questrom, who begins at Penney on Sept. 15, to take a number of steps this year, perhaps closing stores, announcing a major inventory write-off, or trimming the number of vendors and brands in Penney stores.</p>
        <p>''It's the best possible outcome of this company's executive search, frankly,'' said George Strachan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who raised his rating on the stock. ''He's got a lot of charisma and is very decisive.''</p>
        <p>Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, applauded the move but said he did not expect Penney to show quick improvement. ''I don't consider it to be tremendously undervalued, given its earnings prospects'' in the near term.</p>
        <p>Penney shares gained $2.375, to close at $17.25.</p>
        <p>At Barneys, Mr. Questrom had an unusual compensation package that granted him about 15 percent of the company's equity, depending on vesting and other requirements, in return for a three-year employment contract.</p>
