        <p>Time's up, people. We've got political conventions coming, with running mates, protesters -- all the stuff you need to hold an actual presidential election. No more pretending this campaign isn't really happening. Duty calls.</p>
        <p>Over the last few months Al Gore has been campaigning like crazy, unfazed by your inattention. His current message is that George W. Bush would turn the country into another Texas, a place Mr. Gore has been depicting as a sort of Burkina Faso with oil rigs. This pitch might work slightly better if Mr. Gore himself had not spent so many years as Number Two to the former governor of Arkansas. But the Democratic National Committee lent a hand the other day, somberly issuing a traveler's warning that urged visitors to the Lone Star State to update their immunization shots. Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has been proceeding at a more leisurely pace -- being inclusive, bonding with Dick Cheney and building his dream ranch house. This is going to be the only presidential candidate in history who spends the campaign working on his retirement home.</p>

        <p>Over the last few months Al Gore has been campaigning like crazy, unfazed by your inattention. His current message is that George W.

        <p>Back in Washington, Bill Clinton gave a radio interview in which he responded to a question on what the last eight years had done to his marriage with the following:</p>
        <p>''Oh, I think it's been good for ours because I got to live above the store. . . . There's a swimming pool here and Hillary and I spent a lot of happy days out there just talking and reading. . . . We've probably had more time together in our time here that at any point in our marriage. . . . It's been wonderful for us.''</p>
        <p>Nothing else has occurred that was anywhere near that amazing. However, these are some runner-up memorable moments:</p>
        <p>May 15 -- Reacting to criticism that Al Gore's campaign is adrift, Tony Coelho tells The Times: ''When people say 'Maybe you've lost some traction,' they have no idea what we're doing. . . . Just watch us. Watch us go forward.''</p>
        <p>May 31 -- George W. Bush irritably tells a TV interviewer he has read ''a lot more books than you give me credit for.''</p>
        <p>June 3 -- Nothing much happens in the presidential race, but over in England, Queen Elizabeth invites Prince Charles's mistress to a garden party.</p>
        <p>June 5 -- The New York State Republican Party sends out a fund-raising letter calling Hillary Rodham Clinton ''a brash and bombastic, devious and dangerous, selfish and self-promoting politician.''</p>
        <p>June 6 -- Boosting his friend George W. Bush to reporters, Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico recalls a conversation they had at a conference on state government. ''George turns to me and says, 'What are they talking about?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'You don't know a thing, do you?' And I said, 'Not one thing.' He said, 'Neither do I.' And we kind of high-fived.''</p>
        <p>June 14 -- Not to be outdone in humanizing the presidential candidate of his choice, Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, tells reporters that Al Gore is ''not only a great person, but he's very funny. . . . he is always picking up the phone to check on his mom.''</p>
        <p>June 15 -- Pat Buchanan, Reform Party presidential hopeful, campaigns in New York, attempting to broaden his base with a speech opposing the United Nations war crimes tribunal. He also blames Hillary Clinton for the recent sexual assaults in Central Park.</p>
        <p>June 16 -- Tony (''Watch us go forward'') Coelho resigns.</p>
        <p>June 18 -- The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, tells a TV interviewer that ''the House deserves a lot of credit for passing a bill overwhelmingly, bipartisanly, to eliminate the death penalty. We're going to bring that up in the Senate.'' Further questioning reveals that the death penalty he has in mind is the estate tax.</p>
        <p>June 28 -- Asked if the scandals in his administration are hurting Mr. Gore's campaign, President Clinton says, ''a whole bunch of this stuff was just garbage,'' and reminds reporters that the only thing the vice president was ''implicated in is this campaign-finance thing.''</p>
        <p>July 19 -- New York Republicans send out a new letter, accusing Mrs. Clinton of being ''ambitious, ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulative'' and ''an angry woman.''</p>
        <p>July 20 -- Al Gore accepts an invitation to debate George W. Bush on the David Letterman show. ''We think this will pretty much decide the election,'' says the show's executive producer.</p>
