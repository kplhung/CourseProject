        <p>After years of investigations, federal, state and church authorities said today that they had agreed to disagree about the events that led to the slaying of one of Mexico's two Roman Catholic cardinals in 1993 in a shootout at an airport.</p>
        <p>In a news conference on the latest review of evidence, which itself took two years, federal prosecutors ridiculed suggestions that the prelate was the target of a conspiracy, and they stood by the conclusion of the initial investigation.</p>
        <p>They said the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, was shot to death in an afternoon of gunfire and mayhem at the Guadalajara airport by narcotics traffickers who mistook him for a rival drug lord.</p>
        <p>But top officials from Jalisco State, where the slaying occurred, and church leaders who participated in the review cast doubts, noting that the first investigation was secretly led by a general who was later found to be working for the narcotics cartels. The Jalisco officials also cited signs of evidence tampering, pressuring of witnesses and other irregularities in the full investigation, which spanned seven years.</p>
        <p>The divergent conclusions mean that a cloud of doubt will linger about the slaying, which was a signal for many Mexicans about the reckless arrogance of the drug lords and the power that they had accumulated as Mexico's marijuana and opium crops proliferated and its importance grew as a smuggling route for Colombian cocaine.</p>
        <p>The final report today by a committee that included representatives of the attorney general, the Jalisco government and the Catholic Church brings the lengthy inquiry to a close.</p>
        <p>In the first months of the investigation, the authorities learned that Cardinal Posadas approached the airport on May 24, 1993, at just the moment in which gunmen led by Ramon Arellano Felix, a leader of the main cocaine-smuggling organization in the Mexican state that borders California, opened fire on a rival cartel based in the states south of Arizona. That group was led by Joaquin Guzman Loera and Hector Palma Salazar.</p>
        <p>For months, members of the rival gangs had been killing each other in shootouts at discos and restaurants. The airport became an inferno as the gangs exchanged automatic fire.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Posadas, 66, was at the airport to pick up the papal nuncio, who was arriving for a visit. As he sat in his car at the terminal, Cardinal Posadas was shot 14 times at close range. At least six other bystanders were also killed.</p>
        <p>In the weeks after the shooting, Mr. Guzman Loera and dozens of gunmen who had participated in it, including federal and Jalisco State police officers found to be working for him, were arrested and put on trial for drug crimes and for their involvement in the airport shooting. Mr. Palma Salazar was jailed two years later. Mr. Arellano has not been arrested.</p>
        <p>''This was a terrible killing that occurred by accident,'' a top prosecutor, Jose Luis Ramos, said at the news conference today as Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar listened.</p>
        <p>But officials from the Jalisco government led by Gov. Alberto Cardenas Jimenez, a member of President-elect Vicente Fox's center-right party, disputed the federal conclusion, and two bishops who represented the Catholic Church's episcopal conference said they shared those doubts.</p>
        <p>''This was a premeditated homicide,'' said Fernando Guzman Perez, the No. 2 official in the Jalisco government. ''This was no accident.''</p>
        <p>To explain that view, Mr. Guzman noted that federal prosecutors had originally said Cardinal Posadas had been killed in cross-fire, until ballistic tests showed that he had been shot point-blank. He also noted that prosecutors had changed the testimony of several witnesses and that official documents and videotapes from the investigation had gone missing in the investigation.</p>
        <p>An especially troubling aspect, Mr. Guzman said, was that Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the general in charge of the Guadalajara region, rather than civilian prosecutors, had led the original investigation, in which suspects were interrogated and evidence stored at an army base.</p>
        <p>General Gutierrez was later arrested and is on trial for drug crimes, accused as a longtime associate of Mexico's largest drug organization.</p>
        <p>''For the church, this case is not closed,'' said Cardinal Juan Sandoval Iniguez, Cardinal Posadas's successor and a review participant.</p>
        <p>Correction:  August 9, 2000, Wednesday  An article on July 28 about a two-year review of the slaying of a Mexican cardinal in 1993 referred incorrectly to the conclusions of two bishops who took part in the investigation. Unlike some Roman Catholic leaders, the two bishops shared the view of prosecutors that the killing of the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, occurred when drug traffickers mistook him for a rival, and was not intentional.</p>
