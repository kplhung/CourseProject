        <p>A federal judge in San Francisco ruled yesterday that the Hearst Corporation's $660 million purchase of The San Francisco Chronicle did not violate antitrust laws and that the company would have had legal justification for closing The San Francisco Examiner had it chosen to.</p>
        <p>The Chronicle has been a fierce journalistic rival of The Examiner, the newspaper that gave William Randolph Hearst his start in publishing, for more than a century. The two newspapers have also been business partners for the past 35 years.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, the judge, Vaughn R. Walker of Federal District Court, noted that The Examiner's financial condition was so weak that it ''imposes a substantial drain on the profitability'' of the newspaper agency whose profits were shared by both papers. The Chronicle's circulation of 464,943 is more than four times The Examiner's.</p>
        <p>Since the closing of The Examiner would have been economically justified, its subsidized sale to the politically influential Fang family in San Francisco was laced with what Judge Walker called ''malodorous aspects,'' in reference to the complicated political and legal dance behind the sale.</p>
        <p>The sale to the Fangs came in March, after weeks of pressure from the Justice Department, which was threatening to use its regulatory authority to block the sale of The Chronicle. For months, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., a Fang ally, had also promised to fight any effort to close The Examiner.</p>
        <p>In last fall's mayoral election campaign, The Examiner's publisher, Timothy White, offered to ''horse trade'' with the mayor. According to evidence presented in the trial, Mr. White suggested that The Examiner would give editorial support to Mayor Brown in return for his political support for the paper's business plans.</p>
        <p>Last March, Hearst agreed to sell the newspaper to the Fangs' business and give it a subsidy of up to $66 million for three years to help keep a truncated version of the newspaper alive. While the judge was critical of the Justice Department stance that provoked the sale, he said that Clinton Riley, who had challenged the transfer of The Examiner, did not have legal standing to make that claim. .</p>
        <p>Judge Walker's decision paves the way for Hearst to act on its plans to merge the Chronicle and Examiner newsrooms and to compete with Bay Area rivals. The San Jose Mercury News, owned by Knight Ridder, this week began delivering a special San Francisco edition, firing the first shot in the latest battle for readers in one of the country's wealthiest areas.</p>
