        <p>KANE ALEXANDER, Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. This fresh-faced 23-year-old Australian, an alumnus of a homegrown production of ''Les Miserables,'' is a poised, charming, raven-haired Ken doll with a real singing voice. A protege of Les Solomon, the same impresario who introduced David Campbell, Mr. Alexander blends American and Australian show tunes into an autobiographical odyssey that carries him from a tiny village in the Outback to New York City. As ingenuous as he may appear, his interpretations are tasteful and intelligently conceived. Tonight at 9 and 11. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird, tomorrow night at 9, Natalie Douglas, singer. Cover: $20; $15 minimum; at 11, Alton White, singer. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.

        <p>MARC SALEM, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater in Midtown with his 1997 show ''Mind Games.'' Now, Mr. Salem, accompanied by a bass, piano and percussion trio, will be in residence at Feinstein's through Sept. 2 with ''Mind Games and All That Jazz.'' But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the distance that enhances the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays. The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the ''Twilight Zone'' sort. Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights. Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 and 11; Sunday at 1:30; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 8:30. Cover: $40 for weekends; no cover on weekdays; dinner required for early show on weekends, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show; Sunday brunch is $30 and cover is $30. Through Sept. 2 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight, Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; premium ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
