        <p>Some people view Zab Judah's next fight as a test. Judah views it as a steppingstone.</p>
        <p>Putting his unbeaten record (23-0, 17 knockouts) on the line, Judah is eager for his coming International Boxing Federation junior welterweight championship bout against Terronn Millett, Aug. 5, at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Conn.</p>
        <p>Millett (22-1-1, 17 knockouts) is no pushover. He is the former I.B.F. junior welterweight champion, but Millett was stripped of his title earlier this year after he broke his right hand and was unable to make a mandatory defense against Judah.</p>
        <p>Now Judah is the champion, and he intends to remain one.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to make any predictions, but I'm in the best shape of my life,'' said Judah, a 22-year-old Brooklyn native, who has quickly earned a reputation as one of the world's most talented young boxers. ''I'm the best and I'm going to show the world that.''</p>
        <p>Millett intends to be a problem.</p>
        <p>''Zab's somewhat quick, but he's not as blazing quick as the media says he is,'' said Millett, speaking on a conference call yesterday. ''He may hit hard, but I hit hard. Once we get in the middle of the ring, we'll see.''</p>
        <p>Judah won the title in February with a fourth-round knockout of Jan Bergman. But Judah was not overly impressive in his last fight, winning a decision against the journeyman Junior Witter in Scotland.</p>
        <p>But Judah's hand speed and footwork have been compared with a former great champion, Pernell Whitaker. Judah became a protege of Whitaker's, and he learned his lessons well. Judah compiled an amateur record of 110-5, and he was a five-time Golden Gloves champion. Since turning professional, Judah has enjoyed mostly one-sided victories.</p>
        <p>Lou Duva, who managed Whitaker and now manages Judah, believes comparisons between Judah and Whitaker are valid.</p>
        <p>''I had the same feeling when I took over Pernell Whitaker as an amateur,'' Duva said. ''Zab can do anything Pernell Whitaker could, and maybe better. Zab Judah is going to a great champion, but he needs to fight a good fighter, and that's why we're fighting Millett.''</p>
