        <p>The work seemed simple enough: go door to door, ask a few questions, all for a generous $18.50 an hour. But several census workers in the northeast Bronx office of the Census Bureau said that what began as an appealing summer job -- counting households for the 2000 census -- degenerated to the point where supervisors working to meet deadlines pressured workers to cut corners and even submit fraudulent or incomplete information.</p>
        <p>Directed by their supervisors to complete detailed forms on up to 120 households in three or four days -- a task census workers said was nearly impossible -- they abandoned proper procedures, several workers said in interviews.</p>
        <p>If people were not home, the workers said, they ignored Census Bureau requirements that they return five times to try again. Instead, sketchy details were gleaned from neighbors or landlords across a swath of the borough stretching from Wakefield to Throgs Neck. And in hundreds of cases, the workers said, they falsified data or turned in information they knew was inadequate.</p>
        <p>The workers said that managers, through threat of firing or docking of pay, encouraged the fraud and allowed hundreds of inaccurate forms to be turned in to the local office at 2121 Glebe Avenue.</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, workers in three other offices, in Queens, in Manhattan and in White Plains, gave similar accounts of being pressured to produce dubious data.</p>
        <p>''They just wanted us to get the work done,'' Debra Mauriello, who oversaw a 21-member crew of workers in the northeast Bronx, said of her immediate superiors. ''As long as the information was there, whether it was right or wrong, they didn't care, as long as it was there.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mauriello estimated that of the 1,500 households for which her census workers were responsible, 300 to 400 had data that was collected in a slipshod manner. Purely fabricated data was submitted for another 200 households, she estimated.</p>
        <p>Nancy DeLucia, a worker who went out daily with another crew in the Bronx district, said that Paul Lombardo, an assistant manager who oversaw field operations for the Glebe office, explained to her that accuracy had to be sacrificed in exchange for production after he had fired Ms. DeLucia's manager, Diane Jungk, for a lack of productivity.</p>
        <p>National, regional and local census officials adamantly denied the charges and said extensive computer and manual reviews of the Bronx show fraudulent or incorrect documents did not pass through.</p>
        <p>Computerized comparisons were made between the Bronx and other offices, said Steve Jost, an associate director of the Census Bureau. He said nothing out of the ordinary emerged. Census examiners also interviewed workers and reviewed logs without finding any wrongdoing, he said.</p>
        <p>''We're constantly tracking this stuff,'' Mr. Jost said, ''and the data does not confirm these allegations.''</p>
        <p>The charges by workers in the northeast Bronx office come as Representative Dan Miller of Florida, the chairman of the Congressional subcommittee on the census, has called for a review of census practices at 15 of the bureau's 520 local offices where he believes fraud may have taken place. One of those districts is in northwest Queens, another on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Miller said that unusually rapid completion rates in the local offices should be investigated, partly because they came in hard-to-count areas with large numbers of minority and immigrant residents. One district, the heavily Cuban-American city of Hialeah, Fla., is being recounted from scratch this week after questions about the initial count surfaced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said the possible problems with the local census offices in Queens and Manhattan concerned sudden surges in the number of households recorded as counted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller said that in northwest Queens, for example, 17 percent of all households listed for enumeration were counted during one week in June when the deadline for completion was approaching and there were only 400 workers, known as enumerators. Five weeks before, with more than 1,000 workers at the bureau's disposal, 20 percent of listed households were counted.</p>
        <p>''They rushed things unnecessarily,'' Mr. Miller said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Census Bureau has rebutted Mr. Miller's charges, saying that quality control procedures caught any inaccurate information in those districts. Tony Farthing, head of the bureau's New York regional office, said that the late surges found in the districts cited by Mr. Miller -- Newark was also among them -- were attributable to his practice of assigning only the best enumerators to those offices to complete the count.</p>
        <p>Workers in four New York area offices, though, described a frantic atmosphere in the final days of the counting in which managers pressed field operation supervisors, who pressed crew leaders, who then called on enumerators to finish the effort.</p>
        <p>A field operation supervisor said census workers on the Upper East Side were beside themselves because of their inability to get into doorman buildings. So they were making up information and filling out the forms in the office, he said.</p>
        <p>In the White Plains office, Leslie Winters, a crew leader who lives in Rye, said the problems in her district came to a head in a meeting at the end of May when supervisors told crew leaders that questionnaires had to be completed, even if it meant filing in the blanks. She wrote a letter of formal complaint and sent it to the regional office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farthing, the regional supervisor, wrote back to say a census review would catch inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>Crew leaders in the Bronx, meanwhile, said their enumerators had no choice but to fabricate if they wanted to complete what they said was the required work, about 120 households.</p>
        <p>''Quality was not of the essence here,'' said Ms. Jungk, the crew leader who was fired. ''Quantity and speed were. They weren't interested in the results.''</p>
        <p>Assuring an accurate count on the census is of paramount importance. Census data is used to distribute billions of federal dollars and to redraw Congressional and state legislative districts. The bureau estimates that in 1990, the census missed 4.7 million people nationally and 240,000 in New York City.</p>
        <p>Census officials acknowledged that workers in the Bronx and elsewhere had been fired for low productivity since the enumeration process began in April. But the goal that was set for the 1,200 enumerators in the northeast Bronx office, 40 households per week per worker, was not unreasonable, local census officials said.</p>
        <p>Those who have been complaining, the officials suggested, may have been disgruntled about jobs they found much more difficult than they had expected.</p>
        <p>''Yes there was pressure,'' Mr. Lombardo, the Bronx supervisor, said yesterday. ''But at no time was it ever O.K. in the slightest way to file for fictitious incorrect falsification. What's the point of doing the job if you're not going to do it right?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farthing, who oversaw all 39 districts in the New York area, said  allegations of all kinds were expected in a national work force that earlier this summer numbered 550,000 enumerators. But systematic deficiencies in data gathering have not been detected, he said, and ''no one has brought to my attention that we have a big problem.''</p>
        <p>''We get all kinds of allegations at all times,'' he added. ''This is not something that surprises us.''</p>
