        <p>Two advocacy groups called on the Justice Department today to investigate whether the Democratic and Republican Parties were violating federal election laws by using large unregulated political donations to pay for TV commercials promoting the campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the nonpartisan groups, Common Cause and Democracy 21, asked Attorney General Janet Reno to consider again an issue that was at the center of a prolonged and bitter controversy among law enforcement officials over accusations of improper use of campaign donations in the 1996 presidential campaign. Four years ago, Common Cause challenged the legality of millions of dollars used for similar advertising, charging that the commercials promoted specific candidates, not party issues.</p>
        <p>Although some lawyers and officials at the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission agreed, neither agency took action. The two advocacy groups also asked the election commission today to review the issue.</p>
        <p>At issue are advertisements that have been running in at least 15 states for more than a month and are paid for with ''soft money'' -- donations made to political parties without limits as long as the money is used for party building activity. Under the law, advertisements for candidates are supposed to be paid with  ''hard'' or ''federal'' money -- that is, donations limited by law and matched by federal money.</p>
        <p>But Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former Massachusetts attorney general, and Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, contended in their letter that the advertisements they opposed violated election law.</p>
        <p>''The Gore and Bush soft money ads are clearly campaign ads designed and intended to promote the presidential candidates, are created by members of the presidential campaigns, are targeted to run in key presidential battleground states, are indistinguishable from other presidential campaign ads and are without question 'for the purpose of influencing' the presidential campaigns,'' the letter stated.</p>
        <p>The phrase, ''for the purpose of influencing'' is from the Federal Election Campaign Act, which requires that advertisements with such a purpose be paid for with regulated money.</p>
        <p>The advertisements cited by Mr. Harshbarger and Mr. Wertheimer are, in fact, paid for both with hard and soft money, spokesmen for each party said. The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee defended the advertisements, noting that none explicitly called for the viewer to vote for Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The organizations of Mr. Harshbarger and Mr. Wertheimer advocate the overhaul of federal election laws. The men estimated that if the Justice Department and the election commission did not act, ''as much as $100 million in illegal funds will be raised and spent in the 2000 presidential election.''</p>
        <p>Common Cause filed an almost identical complaint in 1996 about the campaigns of President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, and the result was a battle lasting years in the Justice Department over whether to investigate the accusations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno opened a preliminary investigation in September 1998 to determine whether she should seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate at least the Clinton part of the accusation. Mr. Dole was not covered under the independent counsel law, which has since expired and had applied solely to actions by officials in the same administration as the attorney general.</p>
        <p>Louis B. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and many of his assistants vigorously contended that the accusations required an independent investigation, according to memorandums that were later disclosed. Charles LaBella, the head of the Justice Department's task force, also believed that the Common Cause complaint had merit, according to other memorandums addressed to Ms. Reno.</p>
        <p>In the end, Ms. Reno sided with other Justice Department officials who said that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole could not be shown to have broken any laws because each acted on the advice of his lawyers that the so-called issue advertisements were legal. The advice was based on the fact that none contained what courts had called ''the magic words'' that defined a campaign advertisement, such as language urging viewers to ''vote for'' or ''vote against'' a specific candidate.</p>
        <p>The elections commission deadlocked 3 to 3 this February on whether to go forward with enforcement action against the Clinton re-election committee.</p>
