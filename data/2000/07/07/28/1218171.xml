        <p>Michael Winterbottom's uneven ''Wonderland'' could be called ''The Three Sisters'': a modern-day London turn on Chekhov, it deals with the anguish of three women whose existences are in varying stages of disintegration. The director is out to catch life on the fly, and the movie feels real and unrehearsed, especially in the relationships between the sisters, who could be the same woman at different stages of her life.</p>
        <p>Nadia (Gina McKee), a waitress, wants an attachment of some sort -- any sort, actually -- and slinks from one bad entanglement to the next.

        <p>Michael Winterbottom's uneven ''Wonderland'' could be called ''The Three Sisters'': a modern-day London turn on Chekhov, it deals with the anguish of three women whose existences are in varying stages of disintegration. The director is out to catch life on the fly, and the movie feels real and unrehearsed, especially in the relationships between the sisters, who could be the same woman at different stages of her life.</p>
        <p>Nadia (Gina McKee), a waitress, wants an attachment of some sort -- any sort, actually -- and slinks from one bad entanglement to the next. In one of the most riveting scenes in a movie this year, she rides alone on a double-decker bus filled with loud, happy revelers, and her face, normally a mask of dispassion, slowly crumples into a teary mess.</p>
        <p>Debbie (Shirley Henderson), a hairdresser and single mother, runs out to grab a pint and a few more moments of irresponsible fun while her 11-year-old son raises himself. She is angry with the boy's father (Ian Hart, who has come a long way from the quick-witted cruelty of the John Lennon he played in ''Backbeat'').</p>
        <p>The pregnant Molly (Molly Parker) wants domestic simplicity, though there are clear rumblings that her partner, Eddie (John Simm), isn't ready for the family responsibilities that are days away from changing his life forever.</p>
        <p>In following these characters through five days, Mr. Winterbottom doesn't make the expectant mother the source of optimism. The one person in the family whose life is happy is the women's brother, Darren (Enzo Cilenti), the only son. He left home years before to get away from the incessant grousing of his bitter mother (Kika Markham), who sits in her row house and makes as much noise as the neighbor's constantly barking dog.</p>
        <p>In the way Mr. Winterbottom deals with working-class life, ''Wonderland,'' which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, bears a stylistic similarity to the work of the British social realist directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. There is nothing pretty about the way the sisters get through a day. And the sun never breaks through, even at the end, when there is a small gleam of hope in one of the women's futures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winterbottom doesn't rest on making social observations. Rather, he moves in with this family and catches its members in the moments of existential dread when they collectively seem to have no place to go. Even the wiser and more calloused Debbie, who has found a way to detach herself from the chill of her life, has a harrowing moment or two.</p>
        <p>The movie is flush with color and sometimes jerks into accelerated motion, leaving viewers with whiplash while it briefly tracks one of the characters. Michael Nyman's score is like a tonier version of the music Stewart Copeland composed for ''Rumblefish''; the rhythms are like a clock ticking, bringing to mind lost lives and wasted time.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKee, who played Hugh Grant's wise, wheelchair-bound friend in ''Notting Hill,'' doesn't fall back on her dimples and charm. Done up in the accouterments of a techno-music lover, she is shy, with a backpack and her hair in girlish twists, but all her style is on the surface.</p>
        <p>You could come to the same conclusion about ''Wonderland,'' which flits from one life to the next. Essentially an anthology movie, it needs  the actors to bring it to life -- ''Coronation Street'' with a hand-held camera.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKee and David Fahm are intriguing performers who do much with what they have. Mr. Fahm's Franklin, an oversensitive guy who has turned his bedroom into a bunker and listens to music that Nadia might be a fan of, seems to have music videos of a much more glamorous life playing in his head.</p>
        <p>Some sections are gripping. Yet as well done as it is, ''Wonderland'' feels predictable. There is no sad turn in these characters' lives that you cannot see coming about an hour before. It's an odd fix for the man who directed the ace British television mystery series ''Cracker'' to find himself in. Relying on a more realistic setting than he used in his films ''Welcome to Sarajevo'' and ''Jude'' doesn't alleviate the movie's grim inevitability.</p>
        <p>''Wonderland'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity, drinking, sexual situations and a childbirth scene.</p>
