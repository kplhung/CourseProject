        <p>When Commerce Secretary William M. Daley laid down the Clinton administration's strategy this past spring for forcing the China trade bill through a reluctant Congress, he insisted repeatedly that, win or lose, Congress had to vote before the summer political conventions.</p>
        <p>''You just don't want to be debating China during the heat of the fall campaign,'' Mr. Daley said then. ''You do that and all bets are off.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Daley has left the administration to head Al Gore's presidential campaign, and the China trade bill, having cleared the House in May with seemingly unstoppable momentum, has become tied up in the Senate's arcane maneuvering on the budget, efforts to punish China for weapons proliferation, and general procedural gridlock.</p>
        <p>The Senate will adjourn on Friday for the summer having barely begun to debate, much less vote, on the measure that Mr. Clinton repeatedly called a national security priority and his top remaining legislative goal.</p>
        <p>Both the Clinton administration and the Senate leadership expect the bill to pass. The Senate voted 86 to 12 this afternoon to open a debate on China trade, overcoming a procedural hurdle to schedule full consideration of the measure in early September. Nearly 70 senators are thought to support the bill itself.</p>
        <p>Yet the fears Mr. Daley expressed last spring over the fate of the China bill have come true: It became a political hostage while the White House and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, clashed over annual appropriations bills and while Democrats focused on unrelated legislative goals. Meanwhile, the political needs of the Gore campaign sidelined Mr. Daley from the White House lobbying campaign to pass the trade bill, leaving Steven Richetti, a less prominent political hand, in charge of the effort.</p>
        <p>''The patients' bill of rights is simply not an important matter compared to the possibility of nuclear stand-off in Asia,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who has argued that the United States could face a military confrontation with China if Congress fails to approve permanent trade ties.</p>
        <p>''We -- and I mean the Democrats, the White House and the Republicans -- simply do not recognize the weight of this matter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that China remained one of Mr. Clinton's foremost priorities. But since the bill passed the House, the president and many of his top aides have been focused on other issues that will shape his legacy, including brokering a Middle East peace accord, rejecting Republican tax-cut initiatives and, perhaps most of all, helping Mr. Gore become president.</p>
        <p>The president allowed Mr. Daley, who headed the aggressive lobbying effort on behalf of the China bill from January to June, to resign to take over Mr. Gore's lagging campaign. Mr. Richetti, the deputy White House chief of staff who was Mr. Daley's partner in shepherding the China bill through the House, was left to see it through the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richetti said the prospects for passage were good in September, despite earlier concerns that Democrats might have a hard time voting for a trade measure staunchly opposed by labor so soon before a tight election. He urged Mr. Lott to stop using the China bill as a legislative negotiating lever.</p>
        <p>''There is wide bipartisan support for this,'' Mr. Richetti said. ''It's far too important a national security and economic issue to be used as a bargaining chip for other matters.''</p>
        <p>Few fault Mr. Richetti's political skills or his attention to the China trade issue. But several senators and business lobbyists who support the China trade bill said that Mr. Daley has been missed.</p>
        <p>Widely considered Mr. Clinton's best political strategist, Mr. Daley has a no-nonsense style and, among Clinton administration officials, a rare track record of working successfully with the Republican-led Congress. He also demanded -- and was granted -- broad influence over Mr. Clinton's schedule, arranging many public and private events to show that the president had no higher priority than China.</p>
        <p>''We had a sense of urgency in the House and then we lost it -- Daley leaving, the president had some other things, you had the appropriations bills,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''We need to get that urgency back.''</p>
        <p>He said that while there is plenty of support for the measure in the Senate, it will now be subject to intense political pressures and a crowded legislative calendar in the fall.</p>
        <p>One senior administration official described the view that Mr. Daley's departure signaled a downshift on the China bill as ''totally false.'' The official argued that the stall in the Senate began even before Mr. Daley left and that the strategy put in place by Mr. Daley and Mr. Richetti for dealing with those delays remained.</p>
        <p>They and several Senate Democrats put the blame squarely on the Republican caucus and Mr. Lott, who exercises almost complete control of the Senate's daily agenda. Despite overwhelming support from their core constituency -- business -- Mr. Lott repeatedly refused to schedule a firm date for a vote in June or July.</p>
        <p>Republicans see the China vote as a tough one for Democrats because it requires that they offend core labor and environmental constituencies, making a September vote politically appealing. ''I think it's clear that the Republicans want to make it as difficult as possible on the Democrats,'' said Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader.</p>
