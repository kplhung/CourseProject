        <p>VARIOUS ARTISTS: ''Heroes and Villains: Music Inspired by the Powerpuff Girls'' (Rhino/Cartoon Network). Those mutant X-Men are confronting all comers at the box office, but there are champions much tougher than that movie's confused adolescent, Rogue. The Powerpuff Girls, created by Craig McCracken for the Cartoon Network, give young viewers a taste of unequivocal female punch. Buttercup, Bubbles and Blossom talk like the Chipmunks, chew gum, think fast and defeat baddies like the monkey Mojo Jojo without mussing the bows in their hair.</p>
        <p>The show's hip kiddie feminism appeals to underground rockers. For ''Heroes and Villains'' 11 bands united to create a Powerpuff Girls episode in the recording studio. Better than just another soundtrack, this disc boasts pert originals by Apples in Stereo, Shonen Knife, Bis, Frank Black, Cornelius and others, linked to tell a typical Powerpuff tale of chaos, bravado and ultimate triumph. The precocious sound these bands cultivate has never had a more appropriate niche. The Powerpuff Girls are a godsend to cute pop bands, and to prepubescents everywhere.</p>
