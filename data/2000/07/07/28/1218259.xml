        <p>The Senate today joined the House in approving a military spending bill of  $287.8 billion for next year, an amount that is more than $5.1 billion more than requested by the Pentagon or the White House.</p>
        <p>The measure, which was adopted by a vote of 91 to 9, is an increase of more than $21.7 billion in military  spending over the current fiscal year -- and an amount that is greater than the entire foreign aid budget.</p>
        <p>The bill, which now goes to the president, includes a 3.7 percent increase in military pay. The additional $5.1 billion over the nearly $16 billion increase requested by the administration goes mainly for military research contracts that are in  states and Congressional districts of influential lawmakers.</p>
        <p>In the brief debate over the bill, Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and one-time presidential candidate, excoriated his colleagues. Mr. McCain noted that nearly $2 billion worth of items that had not been requested by the administration and were not part of the bills originally passed by the House and Senate had been added by House-Senate conferees.</p>
        <p>''It's the surplus,'' Mr. McCain said in an interview in response to a question of how so many spending items ended up in the bill. ''This kind of spending just grows and grows. And these are Republican fiscal conservatives. It's disgraceful and it's obscene and I am embarrassed by it.''</p>
        <p>With the passage of the bill -- the House adopted the measure on July 19 -- Congress has completed its work on about half the $600 billion in discretionary spending that it says it wants to spend in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But, in many ways, lawmakers have taken care of the easier half.</p>
        <p>Indeed, after a week of frenetic activity on a number of spending bills, including those financing the Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services departments and the White House, Congress had little to show for its work as it moved toward its monthlong August recess.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the week, Republicans were hopeful that the House would complete work on all 13 spending bills, and perhaps even approve at least one measure that had emerged from a House-Senate conference. But problems soon cropped up. Senate Democrats stalled consideration of a spending measures covering operations for the Department of the Treasury, the White House and other federal agencies as a protest over what they considered the body's slow pace in confirming President Clinton's judicial appointments.</p>
        <p>Even before the bill became bogged down the White House and Congressional Republicans entered into tentative negotiations early in the week over three spending measures. But the talks never progressed beyond the staff level.</p>
        <p>At one point, Republican leaders publicly dangled inducements such as a raise in the minimum wage of $1 an hour over a 17-month period in order to gain more Democratic support and repealing the 3 percent federal excise telephone tax to gain the backing of conservatives. But that idea was dropped when some conservatives balked at increasing the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>By the end of the week, Senate Democrats halted their delaying tactics. But time had run out for any of the spending bills -- other than military -- to be considered before the recess. ''It's disappointing,'' said Senator Don Nickles, a Republican from Oklahoma and the Senate whip. ''And I don't think the Democrats' strategy is a defensible one.''</p>
        <p>Republicans said that the Democrats had deliberately thrown sand in the legislative gears to push the negotiation over the budget closer to the end of the fiscal year. In past years, Mr. Clinton has had increased leverage in negotiations with Republicans over budget bills as the fiscal year neared an end. The Republicans are worried that they would be blamed if some government departments ran out of money and were forced to shut down.</p>
        <p>''They don't want us to pass these bills because they want to force us into some big summit with an omnibus bill so they can get more spending,'' said Representative Tom DeLay, the Texas Republican who is the House majority whip. ''Well, we ain't going there.''</p>
        <p>The Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, did not dispute the notion that his party slowed down spending bills. But Mr. Daschle retorted that Democrats did so in response to the Republican's reneging on a promise to hold hearings on a raft of judicial appointments, including at least one nominee for appellate court judge who had been waiting for 42 months.</p>
