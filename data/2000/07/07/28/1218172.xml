        <p>Cameras were everywhere when 'N Sync started its sold-out four-night stand at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. There were video cameras to feed the screen onstage; cranes and overhead cameras preparing for yesterday's live HBO telecast of the concert; news crew cameras stirring little sectors of frenzy and pocket cameras in the hands of girls who only stopped shrieking long enough to snap photos of their favorite group member. The audience was at least 90 percent female and nearly 100 percent vocal; Joey Fatone of 'N Sync hardly needed to ask, though he did, ''Are you ready to scream?''</p>
        <p>'N Sync, this year's conquering teeny-pop act, is meant to be seen as much as heard, so it hardly matters if squeals drown out the songs. The five members of 'N Sync usually sing close-harmony vows of endless love, the kinds of things junior high school boyfriends never say so sweetly; their uptempo tunes latch on to the new jack swing of the 1980's, which put brittle hip-hop rhythms under rhythm-and-blues crooning.</p>

        <p>Cameras were everywhere when 'N Sync started its sold-out four-night stand at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. There were video cameras to feed the screen onstage; cranes and overhead cameras preparing for yesterday's live HBO telecast of the concert; news crew cameras stirring little sectors of frenzy and pocket cameras in the hands of girls who only stopped shrieking long enough to snap photos of their favorite group member. The audience was at least 90 percent female and nearly 100 percent vocal; Joey Fatone of 'N Sync hardly needed to ask, though he did, ''Are you ready to scream?''</p>
        <p>'N Sync, this year's conquering teeny-pop act, is meant to be seen as much as heard, so it hardly matters if squeals drown out the songs. The five members of 'N Sync usually sing close-harmony vows of endless love, the kinds of things junior high school boyfriends never say so sweetly; their uptempo tunes latch on to the new jack swing of the 1980's, which put brittle hip-hop rhythms under rhythm-and-blues crooning.</p>
        <p>The songs are more than serviceable, while 'N Sync's members have the requisite cute-boy looks and, equally necessary, virtually no discernible personalities, the better for young girls to fill in the blankness.  Onstage they sang, danced, smiled, made sincere gestures and disappeared backstage for the next costume change while video interludes were shown.</p>
        <p>Television groomed 'N Sync's two lead singers, Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, who were part of Disney's ''New Mickey Mouse Club,'' and television put 'N Sync's concert shows and video clips in young girls' homes. Television and video also dictate 'N Sync's pacing onstage. To start their set, the group was lowered on strings like marionettes, then broke free, re-enacting the cover of their current album, ''No Strings Attached'' (Jive). But they didn't get very far; if they were no longer puppets, they became video-game figures instead.</p>
        <p>It was a frenetic show, piling on special effects as if 'N Sync feared the world's shortest attention spans. Flames, smoke, fireworks, lasers, computer animations, hydraulic platforms and confetti cannons were all deployed, and 'N Sync switched from glittery versions of boy-next-door clothes to doctors' white jackets (in ''It Makes Me Ill'') to shiny sci-fi uniforms.</p>
        <p>While many vocals were overwhelmed by the commotion (and some were apparently lip-synched), the drums were jacked up to heart-massage impact, providing a lower-register counterpoint to the squeals. The only respite arrived when the group sang ''I Thought She Knew'' unaccompanied, harmonizing like the Beach Boys retrained by Stevie Wonder.</p>
        <p>In many songs, 'N Sync was choreographed to move on every beat, making the singers twitch like digital animations. Now and then, a song would start and stop dead: freeze-framed, as if a fan had her finger on the pause button. Meanwhile, some of the choreography could make American Sign Language seem cryptic; in ''I Want You Back,'' the singers pointed to themselves, then out to the audience, then turned their backs. Most of 'N Sync's dancing was modest until an encore, ''Digital Get Down''; it's the group's one racy song, about video cybersex. When the singers did a suggestive push-up, the screams doubled.</p>
        <p>Like television, 'N Sync flaunts its commerciality, celebrating its fans as consumers. In ''Tearing Up My Heart,'' an electronic ticker ran testimonials like the Jell-O billboard on Times Square. The show's most surreal number, ''Just Got Paid,'' had money raining down on the video screen while the band's costumes were decorated with gleaming dollar signs. If past boy bands are any guide, 'N Sync's payday won't last forever, but they work hard to collect while they can.</p>
