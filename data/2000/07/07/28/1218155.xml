        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 7.</p>
        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>* ''ALICE AND MARTIN,'' starring Juliet Binoche and Alexis Loret. Directed by Andre Techine (R, 123 minutes). Mr. Techine's sprawling, emotional love story is the kind of movie that makes you work a little. It takes time to figure out the relationships between the characters, to say nothing of their motives and feelings. But like so many of Mr. Techine's movies, ''Alice and Martin'' repays the effort. The unlikely, complicated passion between Martin, the troubled illegitimate son of a wealthy industrialist, and Alice, a brittle violinist, unfolds against an equally complicated and sometimes overcrowded background of family secrets and shifting domestic alliances. Ms. Binoche and Mr. Loret are superb in the title roles (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''BUTTERFLY,'' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano. Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle, devastating new film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Mr. Lozano), a sensitive young boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Mr. Fernan Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political complexity (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''CHICKEN RUN,'' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86 minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Mr. Park, who also directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Mr. Lord's continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority. ''Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ''Stalag 17'' to ''Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Mr. Gibson, the voice of Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the hens to fly. Finally it shows that the hens can save themselves through the pluck of Ginger (Ms. Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal of this. It's a great eggscape from banality (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''CHUCK AND BUCK,'' starring Chris Weitz and Mike White. Directed by Miguel Arteta (R, 95 minutes). At the center of Mr. Arteta's funny, creepy and poignant new film is Buck, a 27-year-old man who inhabits the mental world of a preadolescent boy. As played by Mr. White, who also wrote the screenplay, Buck is needy and sensitive, an object equally of sympathy and revulsion. The film chronicles his attempt to rekindle his childhood bond with his old friend Charlie (Mr. Weitz), who has grown into a distant, self-absorbed careerist. Mr. Arteta's visual sense, Mr. White's insightful script and strong supporting performances from Mr. Weitz and his brother Sam, as well as from Lupe Ontiveros as a kindly theater manager, make this one of the most unusual and affecting coming-of-age stories in some time. ''Chuck and Buck'' is an antidote to the current epidemic of lazy nostalgia for the innocence of childhood and therefore, magically, one of the few truly grown-up movies you're likely to see this year (Scott).</p>
        <p>''DISNEY'S 'THE KID,' '' starring Bruce Willis, Lily Tomlin and Jean Smart. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (PG, 101 minutes). In this cloying throwback to Disney's modest live-action comedies of old, Mr. Willis plays a smarmy image consultant humanized by his encounter with his 8-year-old self (Spencer Breslin), who arrives in Los Angeles via a toy red prop plane. By rights the movie should be dreadful, and it is thick with therapeutic cliches, but it occasionally soars to heights of not bad, thanks to strong performances from Mr. Willis, Ms. Tomlin and Ms. Smart, and to Audrey Wells's surprisingly clever script (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE,'' directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (PG-13, 79 minutes). Tammy Faye Bakker Messner, the former wife of Jim Bakker, is that most American of stories, a figure of tragedy and a joke. This documentary walks us through her life, a veritable catalog of bad marriages, lost televangelist empires, squandered relationships with children and, despite it all, indomitable optimism. ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' cries out for a little more analysis of its subject. Instead it joyfully wallows in the backdraft of her excesses. The directors are awfully quick to forgive Ms. Messner's lack of self-awareness, possibly because she has a heart as big as her hair. She was one of the first in the televangelist crowd to accept gay men with AIDS. The movie makes a case for her because she's a survivor; it's more of a mash note than a formal documentary, and there's nothing wrong with that (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Mr. Caviezel is a morose young policeman who makes contact with his dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Mr. Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for his life, Mr. Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,'' starring Forest Whitaker. Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Mr. Jarmusch does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for the western in ''Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative, bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ''Ghost Dog'' is worth seeing for Mr. Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Mr. Jarmusch's offbeat sense of cinematic style and for the hip-hop artist RZA's brilliant musical effects (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''GROOVE,'' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86 minutes). If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across the city and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the merits of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and funny comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ''Groove'' is a comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of one night of pleasure at a rave. Mr. Harrison and his team don't try to pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather, they're an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications, and this genial picture captures them (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''LOSER,'' starring Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Amy Heckerling (PG-13, 93 minutes). Admirers of Ms. Heckerling's movies -- notably ''Clueless'' and ''Fast Times at Ridgmont High'' -- may be disappointed in her latest effort, a romantic comedy about two college students who overcome the snobbery and cruelty of their surroundings to find true love. The script could have used a few more drafts and a less perfunctory climax, but Ms. Heckerling's characteristic wit and intelligence is still in evidence. Fine performances by Mr. Biggs as the title character, Ms. Suvari as the girl of his dreams and Mr. Kinnear as a sleazy literature professor help make ''Loser'' more enjoyable than most recent youth-targeted date movies (Scott).</p>
        <p>''ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,'' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If ''There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ''Me, Myself and Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Mr. Carrey, in one -- or is it two? -- of his most charming and repellent performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie and plausible bewilderment by Ms. Zellweger (Scott).</p>
        <p>''M:I-2,'' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Cruise returns as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Mr. Woo's loud, flashy, incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie references -- to Hitchcock, to the first ''Mission: Impossible'' movie and to Mr. Woo's earlier, and superior Hong Kong action films -- but it's at once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer viruses, is baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love interest (Ms. Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an element of melodrama that's more grating than affecting. Some good car chases and explosions, though (Scott).</p>
        <p>''THE PATRIOT,'' starring Mel Gibson and Chris Cooper. Directed by Roland Emmerich (R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of prequel to Mr. Emmerich's ''Independence Day'' stars Mr. Gibson as a gentle farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits, using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE PERFECT STORM,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, John C. Reilly and Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 130 minutes). Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ''the storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Mr. Clooney is the ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Mr. Wahlberg and Ms. Lane are the appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Holden).</p>
        <p>''ROAD TRIP,'' starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy Smart, DJ Qualls and Tom Green. Directed by Todd Phillips (R, 91 minutes). ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' meets ''There's Something About Mary'' in this gross-out farce. Four college boys led by Josh (Mr. Meyer) embark on a desperate 1,800-mile journey from upstate New York to Texas to intercept an X-rated dorm room video mistakenly sent to Josh's loyal girlfriend in Austin. The fun is all in the gags, among them the notorious French toast sequence, the envelope-pushing sperm bank scene and the hilarious car-jumped-over-the-bridge demolition derby. You'll laugh despite yourself (Holden).</p>
        <p>''RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 123 minutes). The two powerhouse actors muster all the technique they can bring to bear for this by-the-numbers courtroom drama with flashes of bruising action: it's like the world's most expensive episode of ''JAG,'' with bits of ''The Verdict'' mixed in for extra flavor. Mr. Jones plays a shaky, alcoholic Marine lawyer brought in to defend his fellow marine (Mr. Jackson) against charges of military misconduct. Since ''Rules'' makes it clear from the outset that Mr. Jackson's character is innocent, the only suspense comes from wondering whether Guy Pearce, as the prosecutor,  will be able to maintain his bizarre accent (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''SCARY MOVIE,'' starring Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra and Shannon Elizabeth. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans (R, 88 minutes). Mr. Wayans's latest genre-film spoof doesn't so much lampoon the ''Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time as gross-out comedy. ''Scary Movie'' abounds in crude, often stale jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair, flatulence and dismemberment. There are a few hilarious moments, and some that will provoke guilty laughter, but Mr. Wayans hasn't quite figured out how to parody movies -- like the wildly popular ''Scream'' series -- that already parody themselves (Scott).</p>
        <p>''SHAFT,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A sequel/remake to the 1971 semiclassic, starring the always dependable Mr. Jackson. He plays the nephew of the original Shaft (Mr. Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Mr. Bale), who joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful Mr. Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But Mr. Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of retro and modern cliches (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''SMALL TIME CROOKS,'' starring Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman. Directed and written by Mr. Allen (PG, 95 minutes). The sweet, funny wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ''Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' before returning to its original mode as a caper comedy. Mr. Allen and Ms. Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife, whose cookie business takes off and allows her to indulge her dream of being a Park Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild) and the screwball comic tone is impeccably sustained. Ms. Ullman (putting on her Fern Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin) are delightfully goofy (Holden).</p>
        <p>''SUNSHINE,'' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle, Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180 minutes). In Mr. Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history, Mr. Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family -- grandfather, father and son -- who endure the corruption of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of Fascism and the brutality of Communism. Mr. Fiennes's performances and those of Ms. Ehle and Ms. Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life) help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of the story is crudely told, ''Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WHAT LIES BENEATH,'' starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 130 minutes). Mr. Zemeckis's film takes its time in laying out the story of high-strung Claire (Ms. Pfeiffer), who is dissolving into hysteria on a regular basis. Her daughter has just gone off to college, and Claire is still recovering from the trauma of a car accident. Then her house starts showing signs of being haunted. Her husband, Norman (Mr. Ford), is a driven research scientist with a secret. This thriller is as implausibly chilling as any ''X Files'' episode. By the last 10 minutes your interest will have long vanished (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''X-MEN,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Anna Paquin. Directed by Bryan Singer (PG-13, 105 minutes). The long-awaited arrival of Marvel Comics' do-gooder mutants is mildly fun on a couple of levels: for one, the acting duel between Mr. Stewart (as the mutant telepath Prof. X, the X-Men's leader) and Ian McKellen (as the mutant nemesis Magneto, who possesses the power of supermagnetism). As these two austere hams trill their vowels at each other you get the feeling you really are watching members of another species in action. And Mr. Jackman scores as the two-fisted, confrontational Wolverine, a mutant with superstrength, an ability to heal all wounds and metal-alloy claws that shoot out from his knuckles. He lives to fight, a boisterous tragic hero with no complications. Otherwise the movie is an earnest affair that is clumsy when it should be light on its feet; it takes itself even more seriously than the comic book does, though its fans may be overjoyed by that devotion (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''BEHIND THE MIRROR: AMERICAN FILM IN THE 1950's.'' In the midst of post-World War II prosperity, the United States was beset by fears of Communism and the atomic bomb. In this atmosphere, which included the film-industry blacklist and the rapid growth of television, Hollywood produced some of its most complex and memorable films. Now the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, is revisiting the films of the 1950's with a two-month retrospective that includes works by directors like Elia Kazan, Nicholas Ray, Billy Wilder, Orson Welles, Vincente Minnelli, Sidney Lumet, Alfred Hitchcock and Douglas Sirk, among many others. Tomorrow's program consists of two films by Minnelli. At 2 p.m. the attraction is ''The Bad and the Beautiful'' (1952), starring Kirk Douglas, Lana Turner and Dick Powell in a tale of the ruthless machinations of a Hollywood movie producer. At 4:15 p.m. the feature is ''Some Came Running,'' starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine in a tale of desire and disillusionment in Indiana. Sunday is devoted to two classics of science fiction: Don Siegel's allegory of conformity, ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' at 2 p.m., and Gordon Douglas's excursion into mass hysteria and cold war paranoia, ''Them!,'' at 4. Admission to the series, continuing through Sept. 3, is $8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students with I.D., $4.50 for children from 5 to 18 and free for children under 4. The museum is at 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
