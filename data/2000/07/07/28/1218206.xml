        <p>Russian prosecutors today abruptly dropped their high-profile criminal inquiry into Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Russian press tycoon whose Media-Most empire has been among the Kremlin's sharpest critics.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors did not explain why they had abandoned the investigation, which began with a spectacular May raid by ski-masked policemen and caused an uproar in June with Mr. Gusinsky's brief imprisonment on embezzlement charges. As recently as three weeks ago, prosecutors insisted to Parliament that Mr. Gusinsky had defrauded the government of at least $10 million.</p>
        <p>It was notable that the inquiry was halted just before a Kremlin meeting between many of the country's wealthiest tycoons and President Vladimir V. Putin, whose government has moved against several of them in tax and criminal cases.</p>
        <p>The so-called round table is widely viewed as an attempt to win concessions from the tycoons -- including, perhaps, promises to surrender their deep influence over government agencies and leaders -- in exchange for an end to federal hectoring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky was not invited to the meeting. But like other tycoons, he in effect stood accused of building his empire -- a collection of print and broadcast outlets -- through corruption and influence-peddling in the early days of Russian independence, and the others had supported him.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Gusinsky insisted that the charges were a sham, designed to punish Media-Most for its criticism of Mr. Putin's handling of the war in Chechnya and of corruption in the administration of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky's counterattack proved so adroit that even the White House offered him tacit support, as President Clinton went to an interview at a Media-Most radio station during his recent trip to Moscow.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gusinsky's spokesman and his lawyer said simply that the charges had been dropped for lack of evidence to support them. A letter from the prosecutor's office was published today on the Media-Most Web site (www.mediamost.ru) stating only that the proceedings had been canceled and that assets seized during its course had been unfrozen.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor's office refused to confirm that the letter was genuine. But an unidentified official in the agency's public-relations office told the Interfax news service that Mr. Gusinsky had been cleared as a suspect in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>Since the day in mid-May that the federal police swooped into the headquarters of Media-Most, toting automatic rifles and wearing camouflage, the object of the investigation has never been completely clear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky apparently was accused of swindling $10 million or more from the Yeltsin government in 1997, during a deal involving the privatization of a bankrupt St. Petersburg television station. But details of that accusation never became public.</p>
        <p>At other times, investigators seized records of hundreds of millions of dollars in loans or guarantees given Media-Most by Gazprom, the state-controlled natural-gas monopoly, which has called the aid a simple business investment. And at one point, the prosecutors seized a souvenir gun that Mr. Yeltsin had once given Mr. Gusinsky, saying he had no permit to own it.</p>
        <p>Today the anonymous spokesman for the prosecutors told Interfax that the inquiry into the St. Petersburg television deal would continue, but that its focus had shifted from Mr. Gusinsky and Media-Most.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky, freed from the prosecutors' ban on his travel outside Russia, had flown to Spain on Wednesday evening to see his family and was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>At the height of the investigation, in mid-June, officials jailed Mr. Gusinsky, a multimillionaire with citizenship in both Russia and Israel, for three days in Butyrskaya detention center, a notoriously decrepit and dangerous holding pen for Moscow street criminals. The resulting outcry led even government officials to say the investigators might have pushed the boundaries of propriety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin at times seemed to mildly rebuke the prosecutors for their conduct, but maintained that the prosecutor's office was an independent agency beyond his control. More than once, he has suggested that the tycoons built their riches on corruption and that they have no grounds to complain when that corruption comes under investigation.</p>
        <p>But it was never quite clear how much Mr. Putin was involved in the campaign against Mr. Gusinsky. And today, it was still not clear how much he was involved in its apparent end.</p>
        <p>''On the surface, I'd say this has a certain rough correspondence with the way the rule of law is supposed to work -- they investigated him, didn't find anything, and closed the case,'' said Alan E. Rousso, the director of the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''But the reality is a little more nuanced.''</p>
        <p>''The fact he's been cleared of all charges doesn't exonerate the government for the way this was done,'' Mr. Rousso said. ''And it doesn't answer the question about whether this is some sort of witch hunt and exertion of presidential power, or a true clearing of the Augean stables. That remains to be seen.''</p>
        <p>One tycoon, Anatoly B. Chubais, who got his start as Mr. Yeltsin's economic expert and deputy prime minister, called on Mr. Putin today in an interview in the business newspaper Kommersant to show his hand and either wave the prosecutors off  or let corruption inquiries go forward with his explicit blessing.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he was implying that the prosecutor's office was not independent, as Mr. Putin says, Mr. Chubais was succinct. ''Never has been, is not, and won't be for some time,'' he said.</p>
