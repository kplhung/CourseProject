        <p>What would ''heavy'' music sound like if its practitioners knew more than a couple of rhythms and, even better, how to blend them? What if headbanging wasn't a back-and-forth motion but worked in various degrees of side-to-side movements, too? What if metal had room for musicology? Nacao Zumbi, from Recife in northeastern Brazil, answered these questions and thrashed out their position in a deeply impressive midnight set at CBGB on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Nacao Zumbi was the backing band for Chico Science, one of Brazil's most important pop musicians of the last 25 years; together, in the early 90's, they helped create the mangue-beat movement, which conscientiously mined traditional rhythms of the northeast, like maracatu and ciranda, and linked them with metal, dub reggae, sampling and hard funk. Chico Science died in a car accident at 30 in 1997, and since then his band has taken a while to figure out exactly what it is without him.</p>

        <p>What would ''heavy'' music sound like if its practitioners knew more than a couple of rhythms and, even better, how to blend them? What if headbanging wasn't a back-and-forth motion but worked in various degrees of side-to-side movements, too? What if metal had room for musicology? Nacao Zumbi, from Recife in northeastern Brazil, answered these questions and thrashed out their position in a deeply impressive midnight set at CBGB on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Nacao Zumbi was the backing band for Chico Science, one of Brazil's most important pop musicians of the last 25 years; together, in the early 90's, they helped create the mangue-beat movement, which conscientiously mined traditional rhythms of the northeast, like maracatu and ciranda, and linked them with metal, dub reggae, sampling and hard funk. Chico Science died in a car accident at 30 in 1997, and since then his band has taken a while to figure out exactly what it is without him.</p>
        <p>Finally, the band has a new CD, ''Radio S.amb.a'' -- just released in the United States on Stern's Brasil -- and it's a pretty strong manifesto. Though one misses the presence of a single leader (as well as Chico Science's imaginative lyrics), the album comes close to the mangue beat masterpiece, the Chico Science album ''Afrociberdelia.''</p>
        <p>At CBGB the band had seven pieces, including four drummers (two of them playing military bass drums); members of the band took turns singing. They weren't using only typical northeastern rhythms, but samba, too. Still, it wasn't traditional music at all; it was a samba pulse surrounded by a ringing electric guitar and hoarsely declaimed vocals. As the singer Pixel 3000 put it in ''Arrancando as Tripas,'' they were taking samba and ''lunging for its guts.''</p>
        <p>The band's drummer, Fortrex, used James Brown rhythms over the course of an hour's set but used the best devices of reggae to make beats drag and lurch. The guitarist, Jackson Bandeira, rattled out surf-guitar lines and smolderingly powerful rock riffs.</p>
        <p>Many of Nacao Zumbi's tempos are dictated by the graceful, processional gait of maracatu, and generally they were slow enough to accommodate a lot of mobility and cross-rhythm; the music was breathing constantly, in contradistinction to the willfully suffocated feeling of most heavy music.</p>
        <p>The band's live show lacked some of the sampling and sonic juxtaposition that you hear on the recording. Still, it was some of the funkiest hard rock imaginable.</p>
