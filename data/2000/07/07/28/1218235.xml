        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>TUNING OUT THE NEWS  Journalists' coverage of the characters of the presidential contenders has had little effect on voters' perception of the characters of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, according to a study released yesterday. The study's authors at the Project for Excellence in Journalism, in Washington, said that journalists' statements about a candidate's character -- that Mr. Bush was inexperienced, for example, or that Mr. Gore was prone to stretch the truth -- were usually accompanied with supporting evidence but that denials of such assertions were given short shrift. The study examined a sampling of five months of election coverage in 17 news outlets, including network news broadcasts, Sunday morning talk shows, cable news talk shows, national and regional newspapers and online publications. The study compared the themes the journalists emphasized with voters' perceptions of the candidates, as measured in a separate survey of 1,204 potential voters conducted by the Pew Research Center. The comparison indicated that voters gave issues like Mr. Bush's family connections or Mr. Gore's fund-raising tactics substantially different weight than journalists did. The journalists' ''lens on what's being said by one candidate or others doesn't affect the public,'' said Amy Mitchell, one of the study's authors. But, the study noted, journalists offered no evidence for their statements or cited the work of other journalists about one-quarter of the time that they made assertions about the candidates' characters. The researchers found that coverage of Mr. Bush tended to rely on his conduct of this campaign for evidence about his character, while coverage of Mr. Gore tended to rely on his record in Congress, the Senate and the Clinton administration.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE 'MULLING' OVER NO. 2  Speculation may be swirling around Vice President Al Gore's decision on a running mate, but Mr. Gore was the picture of tranquillity yesterday as he sought to begin a vacation with his family on a private island off North Carolina. Mr. Gore told reporters that he had pretty much finished his interview process for a running mate and was entering the ''mulling'' phase of his decision, but he gave no clue as to where that  might take him and would not offer up any names. ''I've got the luxury of time to kind of sit and let things settle for a while,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I have not even preliminarily picked someone.'' He said there were fewer than 10 people on his list of candidates. And he said that none of them would visit him while he was on vacation. He did say he would probably talk with Warren Christopher, who is heading his search for a running mate.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>A WARNING IN LOS ANGELES  Using videotape of street violence at last year's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle to make their point, Los Angeles police officials are warning downtown businesses to prepare for the worst during the Democratic National Convention next month. The officials, saying that as many as 50,000 demonstrators might show up, are suggesting in meetings with business owners that they board up store windows, hire additional security personnel and stock up on emergency provisions like flashlights, food and water. ''It's almost like a tornado,'' Det. Darryl Butler said in a briefing on Wednesday.''You can see it coming, but you don't know where it's going to go.'' While the officials expect many protesters to demonstrate peacefully, they also say they have evidence that other protesters intend to be destructive. Protest leaders say that only nonviolent demonstrations are planned and that fears about violence are overblown. At his monthly news conference on Wednesday, Chief Bernard Parks said that the police would be prepared ''for any eventuality'' but he hoped that protesters and others would not look upon Los Angeles as an ''armed encampment.''</p>

        <p>SECOND ACT FOR BAUER  There was a time earlier in this year's presidential campaign when Gary L. Bauer could conjure up a dream of being on the podium at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, accepting his party's nomination and then, as the former head of the conservative Family Research Council, delivering a ringing call for the nation to embrace religious and family values anew. But when he ended up as little more than a statistical blip in the first tallies of caucus and primary votes, he became one of the first of the White House hopefuls to fold his campaign tent. Still, Mr. Bauer is going to make it to next week's Republican convention, and also to the Democratic National Convention that will follow in Los Angeles. And, in a way, he will have a say in things. He will cover both as a correspondent for an Internet site, Beliefnet.com, which features news and commentary on religions in America. Beliefnet officials said Mr. Bauer would file daily audio reports and write an analytical article examining the role religion plays in Republican politics.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>NO CLOSER IN NORTH CAROLINA  A new Mason-Dixon poll in the North Carolina governor's race has the Democratic candidate, State Attorney General Mike Easley, continuing for the fourth month to hold a double-digit lead over his Republican opponent, former Mayor Richard Vinroot of Charlotte. And it is something of a surprise, since many political experts had expected the race to be one of the country's hottest contests for governor. The poll, covering 625 likely voters and conducted July 20 to 23 for the Winston-Salem Journal and WRAL-TV of Raleigh, found Mr. Easley leading Mr. Vinroot 47 percent to 37 percent, roughly the same gap found by Mason-Dixon polls in April and February. The poll, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, found 15 percent of voters still undecided. Mr. Easley is better known, but Mr. Vinroot still has campaign money to spend, though in the judgment of some political experts he is beginning to run short of time. ''If Vinroot can't make movement in the next month, then he's not going to make movement,'' Ted Arrington, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, told the Journal.</p>
