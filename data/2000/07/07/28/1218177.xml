        <p>Christie's is once again grappling with the way it packages the art it sells, reorganizing its important fall evening sales in New York and London. Each time, executives say, the change is to ''reflect current collecting patterns,'' meaning Christie's is trying to match the art with the right buyers.</p>
        <p>In November Christie's plans to hold three evening sales in New York: Impressionist and modern paintings, drawings and sculptures; postwar art, with classic contemporary masters dating from 1945 to 1970; and contemporary art, made from 1970 to the present.</p>
        <p>Traditionally both Christie's and Sotheby's had two categories for their big sales: Impressionist and modern art in one auction, contemporary art in another. Works made before the 1860's went into 19th-century day sales. Impressionist paintings, drawings and sculptures, though executed in the late 19th century, were grouped with 20th-century art made before 1945. Auctions of contemporary art consisted of works dating from 1945 to the present.</p>
        <p>Three years ago Christie's made what was then considered a radical change by putting works by 19th-century artists like Delacroix and Ingres in the same sales as masters like van Gogh and Monet in an auction labeled ''Impressionist and 19th-century art.'' But the early 19th-century art tended to bog down the sales and failed to bring the high prices experts had hoped for by placing those works alongside the big-ticket Impressionist paintings. Last year, Christie's quietly renamed its Impressionist and 19th-century sale ''Impressionist and post-Impressionist art'' and auctioned the early 19th-century art in day sales.</p>
        <p>In 1997 the auction house also lumped artists like Picasso and Matisse with modern figures like Jackson Pollock and Robert Rauschenberg in sales of 20th-century art. Art dating from the 1970's to the present went into a separate evening sale of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>At the time everyone waited to see if Sotheby's would follow suit. It didn't. After several weeks of internal discussions, executives there announced that the company would stick to the old categories: Impressionist and modern art, and contemporary art, which it continued to define as work dating from 1945 to the present.</p>
        <p>Christie's is also changing the dates of its important London sales. Instead of December, they will now take place at the end of January and the beginning of February. The reason, Christie's experts said, is that December is too close to the New York sales in November; buyers won't have time to pay for their New York purchases before they are bombarded with more works in London. But in London there will be only two evening sales: Impressionist, modern and postwar art in one sale on Jan. 31 and contemporary art the following evening.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's has also held its important London sales in December. Executives there said yesterday that they had not yet decided if they would follow Christie's.</p>
        <p>''It's not that we're going back, but rather that we're tailoring our sales to different markets: London and New York,'' said Franck Giraud, head of 19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's worldwide. ''We've re-evaluated the 19th- and 20th-century picture market and examined some areas that were successful and others that were not.</p>
        <p>''But still, we have to be flexible,'' Mr. Giraud added. ''Top-end works by artists like Corot or Courbet will be included in our Impressionist evening sale.''</p>
        <p>Christie's will continue selling works dating from 1970 to the present in their own sale. ''We created a market that didn't exist at auction before,'' Mr. Giraud said. By offering works that used to be sold almost exclusively at galleries, Christie's was making works by younger artists with long waiting lists -- names like Jeff Koons or Andreas Gursky or Damien Hirst -- more accessible to a wider public. Often, contemporary-art dealers give new works by these artists only to their best customers or to museums. But as soon as they hit the auction market, prices soared, often far exceeding those charged in galleries.</p>
        <p>Holzer Messages</p>
        <p>''Lack of charisma can be fatal.''  ''Use what is dominant in culture to change it quickly.'' These are two of the messages being flashed on a giant electronic billboard at the construction site of the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts at Broad and Spruce Streets in Philadelphia near the First Union Center, where the Republican National Convention is to be held next week.</p>
        <p>Not the typical political messages, they are a site-specific artwork created by Jenny Holzer, the American artist known for her signature ''Truisms'' that have been shown everywhere from the Guggenheim Museum in New York to the Reichstag in Berlin and the Pompidou Center in Paris. When officials from the Kimmel Center approached Ms. Holzer, she agreed to create the installation for no fee. The center has paid only her expenses.</p>
        <p>''It's an important statement about the importance of art in our society that is appropriate to this city and to this time,'' said Stephanie W. Naidoff, president of the center.</p>
        <p>The Kimmel Center, a $225 million public-private project, is to open on Dec. 14, 2001. The 130,000-square-foot complex, which includes a 2,500-seat concert hall for the Philadelphia Orchestra and a 650-seat recital theater, has been designed by the Manhattan architect Rafael Vinoly. Ms. Holzer's work, which went up last night, will run continuously through Aug. 3.</p>
        <p>A Coast Curator</p>
        <p>The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has had a gaping hole in its curatorial staff since its chief curator, Gary Garrels, resigned in December to become the chief curator of drawings and a curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. This week the San Francisco museum announced that Madeleine Grynsztejn, the curator of contemporary art at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh  since 1997, has joined it as senior curator of painting and sculpture.</p>
