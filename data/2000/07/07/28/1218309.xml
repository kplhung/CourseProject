        <p>The two men accused of killing five workers in a massacre at a Wendy's restaurant in Queens on May 24 pleaded not guilty yesterday to murder charges.</p>
        <p>The men, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, were arraigned in the Queens County Courthouse on  50 counts, including murder, attempted murder and robbery, in the slayings at the Flushing restaurant, where seven employees were shot one by one in the head.</p>
        <p>Five were killed: Ramon Nazario, Anita C. Smith, Jean Dumel Auguste and Jeremy Mele and Ali Ibadat. Two other workers -- Jaquione Johnson and Patrick Castro -- survived the shooting.</p>
        <p>With the arraignments, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown,  has 120 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty in the case.</p>
        <p>The lead prosecutor, Gregory L. Lasak, said in court yesterday that  the defendants made several incriminating statements to detectives after their arrest.</p>
        <p>'' 'O.K., I tell you the truth -- I shot five of them,' '' Mr. Lasak quoted Mr. Godineaux as saying to detectives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Godineaux denied killing Ms. Smith, the lone female victim, blaming Mr. Taylor, Mr. Lasak said.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers declined to comment on the statements read in court.</p>
        <p>Family members of the victims wept as they left the courtroom, and some expressed a hope that the district attorney would seek the death penalty for the two men.</p>
        <p>Fighting back tears, Benjamin Nazario, the brother of Ramon Nazario,  said, ''I want them dead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Godineaux's lawyer, Colleen Brady, said she hoped that the publicity surrounding the case would not influence Mr. Brown's decision on whether to seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>The two defendants are being held without bail and are scheduled to return to court on Nov. 20.</p>
