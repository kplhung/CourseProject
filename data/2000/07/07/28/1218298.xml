        <p>The British pop star Sting lost his attempt to claim the Internet address sting.com at the World Intellectual Property Organization. In separate decisions, the board ruled in favor of Microsoft and Reuters in disputes over domain names. Sting became the first celebrity to lose at the Geneva-based organization, which ruled in favor of the Hollywood actress Julia Roberts in a similar dispute. In Sting's case, he could not prove that Michael Urvan of Marietta, Ga., had registered sting.com in bad faith. Mr. Urvan denied that he had sought $25,000 from Sting for rights to the name, and Sting's lawyers produced no evidence. Sting's lawyers could still appeal to a court in the United States.</p>
