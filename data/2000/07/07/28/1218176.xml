        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>GLIMMERGLASS OPERA. Tonight at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown there will be another performance of the much-anticipated production of John Philip Sousa's operetta ''The Glass Blowers,'' the first production of the complete Sousa work since its 1913 premiere. A new edition, based on original sources, has been prepared by Jerrold Fisher and William Martin. And running throughout the frothy score is, not surprisingly, a rousing march tune that keeps turning up in different guises. Christopher Alden is the director and John DeMain conducts. Tomorrow night a production of Handel's rarely staged ''Acis and Galatea,'' sung in English, will be unveiled. The imaginative director Mark Lamos has staged the work. The tenor John McVeigh sings Acis and the soprano Christine Brandes is the Nymph Galatea. Sunday brings the third performance of Strauss's ''Salome'' directed by Leon Major, with the soprano Elizabeth Byrne in the daunting title role. ''The Glass Blowers'': today at 8 p.m.; ''Acis and Galatea'': tomorrow at 8 p.m.; ''Salome'': Sunday at 2 p.m. Alice Busch Theater, Route 80 eight miles north of Cooperstown, N.Y. Tickets: $45 to $90; half-price for those 18 and younger; 10 percent off tickets for students and the elderly. For information and tickets, call: (607) 547-2255 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>ASTON MAGNA. The early-music scene in the Northeast has long shifted between New York and Boston, and what better middle ground is there in the summer than the Berkshire Hills? (Just ask the Boston Symphony Orchestra and New York listeners, who meet annually at Tanglewood.) Although this festival needs no particular excuse to turn its attention to Bach, the composer died 250 years ago, and the last two weekends are devoted directly or indirectly to his music. Here, Daniel Stepner, a violinist and the artistic director, takes the stage in ''Pathways to Bach: Works for Violin Alone.'' Tomorrow night at 6, St. James Church, off Main Street, Great Barrington, Mass., (413) 528-3595. Tickets: $20 at the door; $18.50 in advance; $16 for students and the elderly. The program is also to be presented tonight at 8 at Bard College, Route 9G, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (914) 758-7425. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There is no better place in New York City to experience chamber music with the proper intimacy than at the concerts presented by Bargemusic, the rewarding weekly series that takes place on an acoustically ideal and commodious barge in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. And the performers are always first-rate. Tonight the pianist Paige Hoffman, the violinist Mark Peskanov, the violist Toby Hoffman and the cellist Nathaniel Rosen perform works by Mozart and Brahms. Tomorrow night and on Sunday afternoon Mr. Peskanov and Mr. Hoffman are joined by the pianist Alexander Peskanov and  the soprano DeBorge Pinnington for a program of Mozart, Rachmaninoff and Beethoven. Enjoy the music along with a spectacular view of lower Manhattan. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.; and Sunday at 4 p.m.. Tickets: $27; $25 for the elderly; $15 students. For reservations: (718) 624-4061, or (718) 624-2083 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>BERKSHIRE CHORAL FESTIVAL. This attractive event gathers singers from around the country, even the world, to work on choral masterpieces with noted conductors. Here, John Alexander, the artistic director of the Pacific Chorale in Orange County, Calif., conducts the festival chorus and the Springfield Symphony Orchestra in Copland's ''Old American Songs,'' celebrating the 100th anniversary of the composer's birth, and Vaughan Williams's ''Dona Nobis Pacem.'' Tomorrow  night at 8, Berkshire School, Route 41, Sheffield, Mass., (413) 229-1999. Tickets: $20 to $28 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>CARAMOOR FESTIVAL. For all the interesting programs that are presented at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y., each summer, there is an unfortunate dearth of new music. So at tonight's concert by the Avalon String Quartet the world premiere of a work by Augusta Read Thomas called ''Fugitive Star'' is noteworthy. The event is interestingly conceived. Mozart's String Quartet and Ms. Thomas's work will be performed beginning at 6:30 p.m., followed by a 60-minute dinner break starting at 7:30. After dinner, the audience will have a second chance to hear the new Thomas work, and the concert will conclude with Brahms's String Quartet (Op. 67). On Sunday afternoon the Orchestra of St. Luke's conducted by Maximiano Valdes performs works by Copland, Haydn and Prokofiev (the Violin Concerto No. 2 with Leonidas Kavakos as soloist). And tomorrow, the Caramoor Jazz Festival will be held all day, including the evening. Avalon String Quartet: tonight at 6:30; The Spanish Courtyard; tickets $25. Caramoor Jazz Festival: All day tomorrow starting at 2 p.m. in the Venetian Theater; tickets $40. Orchestra of St. Luke's: Sunday at 4:30 p.m.; The Venetian Theater; tickets $15 to $45. Caramoor Festival, Katonah, N.Y. For directions and tickets, call: (914) 232-5035. (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MARLBORO. Part festival, part training camp for aspiring and accomplished young musicians from Curtis, Juilliard and other conservatories, Marlboro has a special atmosphere of collegiality and love of the art. The current season is its 50th, and it has a lot to celebrate, not least the stewardship of its new co-directors, the exceptional pianists Richard Goode and Mitsuko Uchida. In its public concerts, faculty members and students share the stands in most of the ensembles. Mozart figures prominently into this weekend's programs: his Serenade (K. 375) opens tomorrow's concert, which also includes Hindemith's ''Des Todes Tod'' and the Brahms String Quintet in F (Op. 88); the Mozart Clarinet Quintet (with Richard Hawley as the clarinetist), closes the Sunday concert, which also includes the Martinu Nonet and Schumann's Piano Quartet (Op. 47), in which Ms. Uchida is the pianist. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Sunday at 2:30 p.m., Marlboro Music Festival, Marlboro, Vt. (802) 254-2394. Tickets: $5 to $25 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MAVERICK. This enterprising chamber music series, now in its 85th season, offers concerts in an open-sided barn where the sounds of nature and the music of man interact freely. It also typically offers considerable variety in its programming. The first of this weekend's concerts, tomorrow, is a piano recital by Daniel Epstein in which works by Chopin sit beside Copland's big Variations and John Cage's famously silent ''4'33''.'' The Cage is often joked about, but in fact it was composed specifically for Maverick, the idea being that a listener should focus for a minute (or four and a half of them) on the music of the natural world. On Sunday, the Tokyo String Quartet is to play quartet movements by Mendelssohn and Beethoven's ''Grosse Fugue,'' and will collaborate with the superb clarinetist David Krakauer on the Brahms Clarinet Quintet. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road, between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217. Tickets: $15, $5 for students (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY. Among the many offspring of the Mostly Mozart Festival is this orchestra's three-week Amadeus Festival, now in its sixth year. For the festival's final all-Mozart program, this weekend, Zdeneck Macal, the orchestra's music director, is to lead Symphony No. 13 in F and Symphony No. 38 in D. Between the symphonies, the pianist Vladimir Feltsman joins the orchestra as the soloist in Concerto No. 24 in C minor (K. 491). Tonight at 8 p.m., Richardson Auditorium, Princeton; tomorrow at 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark. (800) 255-3476. Tickets: $15 to $45 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. In the first of two programs the Philharmonic is offering during its annual tour of the parks in and around New York, Andre Raphael Smith is the conductor, and the program includes Glinka's ''Ruslan and Ludmilla'' Overture, John Corigliano's ''Elegy,'' dances from Copland's ''Rodeo'' and the Shostakovich Fifth Symphony. Tonight at 8, Miller Field, Gateway National Recreation Area, Staten Island; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Heckscher State Park, East Islip, Long Island. (212) 875-5709. Admission is free (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NORFOLK CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Yale Summer School of Music retreats north to this lovely spot, and the public reaps much of the benefit at concerts in the quaint Music Shed. This weekend the festival's programs center on great quintets. Tonight Gilbert Kalish joins the Miro String Quartet in Shostakovich's Piano Quintet, and the guitarist Eliot Fisk figures in a lesser work by Boccherini. Tomorrow David Krakauer joins the Tokyo String Quartet in Brahms's Clarinet Quintet, and the Tokyo adds Beethoven's ''Grosse Fuge'' and Mendelssohn's mixed bag of a quartet, Op. 81. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Ellen Battell Stoeckel Estate, Routes 44 and 272, Norfolk, Conn., (860) 542-3000. Tickets: $12 to $36; $5 for ages 18 to 25; free to those under 18 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>PIANO SUMMER. The pianist Vladimir Feltsman directs this international institute and festival, with concerts, recitals and master classes. But here the pianist is Edward Aldwell, best known for his performances of Bach. Mr. Aldwell plays Bach's French Suite in E and English Suite in A minor along with Mozart's great A minor Sonata and works by Faure. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., McKenna Theater, State University College at New Paltz, 75 South Manheim Boulevard, (845) 257-3904. Tickets: $12 and $15 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>RUTGERS SUMMERFEST. Typically this wide-ranging festival veers from one musical style or genre to another: in this case, from small-scale chamber works to symphonic music. Tonight the Steinhardt-Artymiw-Eskin Trio plays Dvorak's F minor Trio (Op. 65) as well as sonatas by Beethoven and Debussy. Tomorrow Richard Auldon Clark conducts the Rutgers Festival Orchestra in Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, with Richard Stoltzman as soloist, Rachmaninoff's Second Symphony and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Russian Easter Festival.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Nicholas Music Center at Douglass College, off Route 18, New Brunswick, N.J., (732) 932-7511. Tickets: $20 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>SARATOGA CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL. The Chamber Music Festival at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center begins its summer season on Sunday afternoon with an intriguing program called ''Alma Mahler: The Muse.'' The publicity materials for the event state that this brilliant woman at the turn of the 20th century in Vienna was ''loved by many of the century's geniuses,'' and that's not such an exaggeration. She had intense marriages with the composer Gustav Mahler, the architect Walter Gropius and the writer Franz Werfel, and intimate friendships with the composer Alexander Zemlinsky and the painter Oskar Kokoschka. She was not just a muse, but also a composer in her own right, who might have accomplished more had she been encouraged. This multimedia event offers songs for voice and piano by Alma Mahler, a piano quartet by Gustav Mahler and a piano trio by Zemlinsky. The Spa Little Theater, Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Saratoga, N.Y., Sunday at 4 p.m. Tickets: $27.50 and $22.50. for information and directions, call SPAC Box Office: (518) 587-3330. (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>TANGLEWOOD. This is a weekend of piano concertos. Tonight in a concert starting at 8:30, Emanuel Ax plays K.482, in E flat, in an all-Mozart program framed by symphonies, Nos. 25 and 40, and conducted by James Conlon. Tomorrow's concert, also at 8:30, is French, and the concerto is Ravel's brilliant escapade in G, played by Louis Lortie. Emmanuel Villaume conducts this and also the overture to Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini'' and Franck's D minor Symphony. On Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Ilan Volkov conducts a concert including Anderson's ''Stations of the Sun'' and Mendelssohn's overture ''The Fair Melusine.'' The concerto is Brahms's D minor, the soloist Daniel Barenboim. On Sunday evening at 8, a production of Verdi's ''Falstaff'' opens, with Seiji Ozawa conducting; the performance is sold out; (888) 266-1200. Tickets: $16 to $70 ($14 for lawn seats) for concerts; $40 to $80 for opera (Paul Griffiths).</p>

        <p>COMPAGNIE MATHILDE MONNIER. A prominent French choreographer seeks to demonstrate that great tragic themes transcend national boundaries. Mathilde Monnier's ''Pour Antigone'' retells the Greek tragedy of Antigone, who refuses to alter her convictions even under threat of death.

The exhibition runs through Sept. 3. Fridays through Sundays, 7 to 10 p.m.  Free. White Barn Theater, Newtown Turnpike, Westport, Conn.; (203) 227-3768 (Dunning).</p>
