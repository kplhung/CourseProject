        <p>Swiss Institute  495 Broadway, between Spring and Broom Streets  SoHo  Through Aug. 19</p>
        <p>The comic book as serious entertainment -- as art, even -- has its passionate devotees. Yet it remains a problematic form that rarely rivals good fiction or film for narrative richness.</p>
        <p>That said, this exhibition of 14 comic book artists from the United States, Canada and Switzerland is terrific. Paradoxically, the show works because it is more than just an exhibition of comic books. At stages within a long, mazelike corridor walled in by suspended plastic panels, each artist has produced his or her own solo installation, expanding their ideas, in most cases, into three dimensions.</p>
        <p>In the first room, Thomas Ott and Daniel Affolter have produced in loving detail the wonderfully filthy, dark and claustrophobic apartment of a fictive aging Mafioso with Mr. Ott's gothic, scratchboard portraits of family members adorning the walls. In the next space, Renee French presents a series of separately framed, postcard-size portraits of bizarre imaginary characters, like a mush-headed mutant in a paisley sweater, rendered in pencil with exquisite refinement.</p>
        <p>Highlights along the rest of the way include the work of Julie Doucet, who makes aggressively funky, ribald character studies on small sheets of graph paper; David Mazzucchelli, whose clean modernistic pages tell the story of a man on an obsessive mission to eradicate pubic hair; Kevin Pyle, whose exposes of secret government medical programs are the show's most urgently political efforts; and Carrie Golus, who draws and writes diaristic, adolescent narratives with deft and touching simplicity. All of this may not rescue the comic book from its juvenile associations, but it makes a persuasive case for the medium's rich, maybe limitless potential.</p>
