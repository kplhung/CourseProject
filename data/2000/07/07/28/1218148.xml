        <p>The guacamole rolls on at the new Rosa Mexicano across from Lincoln Center. It comes to the table unassembled on a wheeled cart crowded with piles of avocados, glass bowls filled with onion, tomatoes and chilies, and the lava stone bowls known as molcajetes.</p>
        <p>Diners indicate how hot they want it, then watch the show as the guacamole master peels, chops, grinds and mixes.</p>
        <p>Patrons of the original Rosa Mexicano on the East Side will recognize the ritual.</p>
        <p>They might do a double take at the decor. ''Splashy'' is the first word that comes to mind, suggested by the thin sheet of water that runs down the two-story blue-tile wall near the entrance.</p>
        <p>All over the wall, dozens of little plaster men in bathing suits, organized in neat rows, lean out in middive. They are all stark white, a shocking contrast to the hot reds, tangerines and bright yellows that dominate the rest of the restaurant.</p>
        <p>The urge to gorge on guacamole should be resisted, despite the bottomless supply of fresh-baked tortillas and tortilla chips.</p>
        <p>When the cart rolls on, the rest of the menu must be dealt with, and portions are large.</p>
        <p>Appetizers range from tingling ceviches, like red snapper marinated in lemon, orange juice, cilantro, tomatoes and jalapenos, to the earthily spiced tostada de cuilacoche, a sauteed mix of huitlacoche (a corn fungus that's Mexico's answer to the truffle), onions, garlic and epazote, a pungent herb.</p>
        <p>Main courses come from the grill or the oven. The grill yields tuna marinated in achiote and the juice of bitter oranges, then topped with pickled red onion, and pork chops rubbed with ground ancho chilies, garlic, cinnamon and oregano.</p>
        <p>The oven offerings include standards like stuffed poblano chilies and chicken in mole sauce, but here and there takes off into more adventurous territory.</p>
        <p>A tortilla pie is layered with shredded chicken, cacciota cheese and poblano chile sauce, and the startling mixiote de cordero, a lamb shank covered in pasilla, ancho and guajillo chilies and then baked in a large parchment bag.</p>
        <p>It arrives at the table looking like the largest beggar's purse on record. In a restaurant that knows how to feed the eye, the big bag of lamb may be the knockout visual.</p>
        <p>Rosa Mexicano at Lincoln Center, 61 Columbus Avenue, at 62nd Street; (212) 977-7700. Dinner entrees, $17.50 to $28.</p>
