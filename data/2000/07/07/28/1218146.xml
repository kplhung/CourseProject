        <p>X-Men  Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, Bruce Davison  Directed by Bryan Singer  PG-13  105 minutes</p>
        <p>Their strength is revealed when a little boy shreds a chain-link fence in a Nazi camp. Mutants from the X-Men comic book. Over the decades their numbers grow and ''sometime in the near future'' they are upsetting ordinary people on a regular basis. We meet a few examples. Wolverine (Mr. Jackman) has Freddy Krueger-style talons that spring from his knuckles. Storm (Ms. Berry) is a walking hurricane and electrical power plant. Rogue (Ms. Paquin) sucks energy from human bodies. Cyclops (Mr. Marsden) can destroy a city block with a stare.</p>
        <p>Otherwise they seem all-right sorts who would mind their own business if others let them. The problem, of course, is that they are different. Congress is turning McCarthyesque. A United Nations group gathers on Ellis Island to address the perceived threat. Among the mutants themselves there are two reactions. Prof. Charles Xavier (Mr. Stewart), who can read minds and affect thoughts, would try to reason with normally endowed humans. Magneto (Mr. McKellen), a mutant rebel and former colleague of Xavier's, would destroy them.</p>
        <p>While the authorities dither, these two wage a high-voltage comic-book zap fest for control of their breed. The professor runs a kind of prep school for talented young mutants, and from gleaming laboratories and battle stations beneath the ivied halls he and his proteges struggle to outwit Magneto, whose powers seem insurmountable.</p>
        <p>Soon they all end up in a wild electrostatic battle at the Statue of Liberty. (With those talons, Wolverine could shut down Con Ed for a week.) Magneto ends up in a plastic box but vows to return. Think there'll be a sequel?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- Behind all those sparks and lightning bolts mutants fling one another around like basketballs and they and regular people get a little blood-flecked. But this is supposed to be the comics.  SEX -- None.  PROFANITY -- Some profane exclamations.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-7 -- A common situation for the very young: too complicated and too loud and intense. Not that attendance would necessarily turn into a rout or have other damaging consequences, but this isn't their movie.  AGES 8 AND UP -- The clouds lift. Discretion is advised, however. Parents know their children.</p>
        <p>Scary Movie</p>
        <p>Jon Abrahams, Carmen Electra, Anna Faris, Shannon Elizabeth, Dave Sheridan, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Cheri Oteri  Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans  R  88 minutes</p>
        <p>To lampoon the ''Scream'' movies, Mr. Wayans's film borrows from several other teenage slasher shows, not to mention ''The Matrix'' and ''The Usual Suspects.'' But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Late one night a pretty, vacant high school miss answers the telephone and with a nervous titter indicates to the caller that she is not quite dumb enough to tell him all about herself. He then tells her he wants to look at her insides.</p>
        <p>''Scream,'' right? Remember, though, this is a spoof. On the stove popcorn swells suggestively in its foil tent. Time for the first blast of flatulence. On the lawn the familar maniac in black robe and Edvard Munch mask flashes his long knife. But this is a killer prone to tripping on porch steps, botching garage slashings and getting as stoned as his potential victims.</p>
        <p>In addition to the blade he wields a gleaming cargo hook. Actually he is the victim of a teenage hit-and-run incident and he wants revenge because he knows what they did. They ran him over. ''We hit a boot, but where's the foot?'' one teenager asks. Finding a body they strip it of credit cards and toss it into the harbor.</p>
        <p>Now it's a year later -- ''one year after, you know, we killed that guy,'' says Cindy (Ms. Faris, stepping into the Neve Campbell ''Scream'' role). The television personality and author Gail Hailstorm (Ms. Oteri) swoops down in an imitation of Gale Weathers from the ''Scream'' adventures. Doofy (Mr. Sheridan) is the imbecilic security man. There is a ''Blair Witch'' rush through the woods. More flatulence and much bloodshed. You know, that Doofy is smarter than he looks.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- One beheading, many stabbings and a sleet of gore. (Where's your sense of humor?)  SEX -- The sex act is continually flaunted and discussed and partially performed. Genitals are on view.  PROFANITY -- Any obscenity you've ever heard (or most).  FOOTNOTE -- On the LCD (lowest common denominator) scale, the film rates a 9, saved from a 10 by a passing attempt at wit now and then. Vulgarity is celebrated in all forms, from the sexual to the intestinal, with an emphasis on bowels. Drugs are heavily in use and there are leaden racial jibes and stereotyping.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 14 -- If they haven't seen it already, resist.  AGES 14 AND UP -- Unless uninterested or dissuaded, they have definitely seen it already.  Pokemon the Movie 2000  With the voices of Ikue Otani, Veronica Taylor, Rachael Lillis, Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein  Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Michael Haigney  G 85 minutes</p>
        <p>To warm up the very little ones the presentation starts with a short subject. The concept is ''rescue'' and involves a young fellow who gets hung up by his backpack on a branch over a towering waterfall. In the leafy glades below, the Pokemon (creatures spawned by Japanese television) frolic obliviously and unintelligibly until a few of them suddenly pop up and free the backpacker.</p>
        <p>The screen goes dark and after a good look at the Nintendo logo we open on the main subject: a not altogether uninvolving story about rejiggering the elements. Aboard a quite grand flying whirligig a smug evildoer called the Collector plots to capture three large and major Pokemon who control fire, ice and lightning. Next he will seize the most important Pokemon, who oversees the oceans.</p>
        <p>It falls to Ash, the human Pokemon trainer, and his little yellow Pokemon pal, Pikachu, to save the environment. On storm-tossed seas, he and his adolescent friends wreck a few expensive powerboats and scramble around the Orange Islands in weather conditions that, depending on which major Pokemon is in the clutches of the Collector, vary from monsoonish to icebound. Will pluck prevail?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE -- Some very mild rough and tumble.  SEX -- None.  PROFANITY -- Presumably none, but Pokemon babble is hard to decipher.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-8 -- Attention may wander, but they will be entertained.</p>
