        <p>COHAN-Richard L. 73, of New York City, on July 20, 2000, died peacefully after a long and valiant battle with kidney cancer. Most beloved husband of Felice (nee Schramm) for 48 years. Cherished father of Betsy and Cathy and loved father-in-law of Bob Zorowitz. Adored grandfather of Sydney and Jane Zorowitz. He was born on November 26, 1926 in New York City, where he was raised and lived except for 27 years during which he was a resident of Westport, CT. He was an alumnus of Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School, Class of 1944, after which he served in the U.S. Navy. He was a member of the Class of 1949 at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. His lifelong work involved international sales and marketing in several industries until his retirement from Wyant Health Care. An avid angler and wildlife preservationist, Dick will be missed by his family and many friends and business associates. Donations in his memory may be made to Gilda's Club, 195 West Houston St., NY, NY 10014 or Kidney Cancer Association, 1234 Sherman Ave., Ste 203, Evanston, IL 60202. A memorial will be announced at a later date.</p>
