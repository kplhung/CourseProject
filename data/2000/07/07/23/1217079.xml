        <p>Caryn Patrice Caputo, a teacher, and Michael Louis Athanasio, a New York City police officer, were married yesterday by the Rev. James Kissane at St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church in East Northport, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The bride, 32, teaches social studies at Jericho (N.Y.) High School. She graduated from Dickinson College and received a master's degree in social studies education from New York University. She is the daughter of Ann Whelan of Yonkers and Anthony A. Caputo of Chadds Ford, Pa. The bride's father is the president of Information Resource Engineering, an Internet security company in Baltimore. Her mother publishes Gluten-Free Living, a newsletter in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, also 32 and a graduate of the New York Institute of Technology, patrols Queens, often on a bicycle. He is a son of Anne and Joseph J. Athanasio of Fort Salonga, N.Y. The bridegroom's father retired as the controller of the Reynolds Organization, a former real estate brokerage firm in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The couple met in September 1997, on the sidewalk outside Shea Stadium. Ms. Caputo was waiting for her brother, who was to meet her with tickets for a Mets game, and Mr. Athanasio was patrolling the area on his bike. Eventually, the crowd of fans around the stadium entered, took seats, and the game began. But Ms. Caputo's brother, who was stuck in traffic, still had not arrived. By now, the streets around Shea were nearly deserted, and the admission gates began to close.</p>
        <p>''There was literally no one around except this bike cop,'' she remembered. ''So, I asked him the time, and we struck up a conversation.''</p>
        <p>An hour later they were still talking. ''He made me laugh,'' she remembered. ''He was looking out for me. He was obviously compassionate. At one point, a homeless guy walked by with a cartful of bottles to redeem, and Mike knew him and said hello. He was clearly a good guy.''</p>
        <p>Finally, her brother arrived, and she and Mr. Athanasio parted without, to Ms. Caputo's immediate regret, having exchanged phone numbers. All during the game, she said, she thought about him, and afterward she looked for him outside the stadium, but by then he was gone.</p>
        <p>''I felt it was an opportunity lost,'' she said. ''We really connected, but I would never have tried to track him down.''</p>
        <p>But he tracked her down. Going on the little information he had gleaned from their chat -- that her name was Caryn and she was teaching at Stuyvesant High School. He called the school and said, ''Hi, can I speak to Caryn in the social studies department?''</p>
        <p>The operator put him right through to her office, and she picked up the phone. ''I was so excited,'' she said. ''He was still on my mind.''</p>
        <p>He asked her out. Their first date started awkwardly but ended well. Their second lasted 11 hours.</p>
        <p>''After the third date, it wasn't even like we were dating,'' she said. ''It was like we were together.''</p>
