        <p>ON Israel's independence day this May, the electricity in our Je rusalem apartment suddenly blew out. We knew the holiday would make it impossible to get an electrician until the next morning.</p>
        <p>So it seemed like a good time to check out the city's new hotels, the 300-room Olive Tree and the 400-room Novotel, part of a planned four-hotel complex near the venerable American Colony Hotel in East Jerusalem. Our children, Emma and Adam, ages 6 and 4, were out of school anyway, and both hotels featured swimming pools and moderate rates, according to their advance publicity. My wife, Debbie Sontag, chief of the Jerusalem bureau of The New York Times, was to join us later.</p>
        <p>Royal Plaza Olive Tree Hotel</p>
        <p>At the Olive Tree, run by the small local Royal Plaza chain, the three of us were greeted warmly by the front desk staff, who were outfitted in Ottomanesque finery. The kids particularly liked the mirror-spangled brimless caps. The Olive Tree opened late last year, just in time for the anticipated millennial tourist boom here. Aimed mainly at Christian tour groups, it is a Holy Land theme inn, constructed around an ancient olive tree said to have marked a traditional stopping place for pilgrims to Jerusalem's Old City. The Damascus Gate is just 15 minutes by foot, along a route that passes the Garden Tomb -- a tranquil spot that Victorian archaeologists insisted was Jesus' true burial place -- and a brace of souvenir shops, the best of them being the Armenian-run Palestinian Pottery.</p>

        <p>ON Israel's independence day this May, the electricity in our Je rusalem apartment suddenly blew out. We knew the holiday would make it impossible to get an electrician until the next morning.</p>
        <p>So it seemed like a good time to check out the city's new hotels, the 300-room Olive Tree and the 400-room Novotel, part of a planned four-hotel complex near the venerable American Colony Hotel in East Jerusalem. Our children, Emma and Adam, ages 6 and 4, were out of school anyway, and both hotels featured swimming pools and moderate rates, according to their advance publicity.

        <p>Royal Plaza Olive Tree Hotel</p>
        <p>At the Olive Tree, run by the small local Royal Plaza chain, the three of us were greeted warmly by the front desk staff, who were outfitted in Ottomanesque finery. The kids particularly liked the mirror-spangled brimless caps. The Olive Tree opened late last year, just in time for the anticipated millennial tourist boom here. Aimed mainly at Christian tour groups, it is a Holy Land theme inn, constructed around an ancient olive tree said to have marked a traditional stopping place for pilgrims to Jerusalem's Old City. The Damascus Gate is just 15 minutes by foot, along a route that passes the Garden Tomb -- a tranquil spot that Victorian archaeologists insisted was Jesus' true burial place -- and a brace of souvenir shops, the best of them being the Armenian-run Palestinian Pottery.</p>
        <p>The rates were reasonable by Jerusalem standards: $180 for a double (including a kosher buffet breakfast, a feature of most Israeli hotels). I knew from a previous quick look around that the rooms were clean and well appointed, if a bit small and spartan. But  none were available. The children's disappointment was tempered by the news that  the indoor pool area was still under construction.</p>
        <p>So we walked next door to the gleaming new Novotel. An airport-terminal-like lobby and dining room seemed utterly unpopulated. There was no one at the front desk, and, aside from a few kitchen workers in the middle distance, no hotel employees at all were visible.</p>
        <p>Following signs, the kids quickly discovered the small outdoor pool, but the shaded and unheated water was rightly pronounced too frigid. When we returned to the lobby, a pleasant young woman at the reception desk explained that the hotel had not yet published a rate list. Rooms were available, but we could not be told the cost until the next day, when the off-site reservations office, closed on holidays, could be consulted by telephone.</p>
        <p>Her guess, though, was about $250 for a couple and two children, who could share a pull-out couch.</p>
        <p>Hmmm. That wasn't much different from the gracious and tasteful American Colony Hotel, a short stroll away, which I had originally ruled out for economy's sake.</p>
        <p>American Colony</p>
        <p>A cloistered compound developed from a 19th-century pasha's manse, the American Colony boasts some of the most pleasing public spaces in Jerusalem: an open dining courtyard with burbling fountain, a luxuriant ''summer bar'' garden, and -- the main attraction for my charges -- a sheltered, grassy pool area, including a wading pool.</p>
        <p>The American Colony has, in fact, only one real competitor, though it is utterly different in style and scale: the King David, the lodging of choice for state visitors to Israeli West Jerusalem and high-end tour groups.</p>
        <p>We were welcomed by the courtly porter, George Qumssiyah, who had retired after 50 years on the job only to return months later as a part-timer. While I registered, the manager, as he whisked by my tired and thirsty children, summoned a waiter to serve ''our young guests'' two fruit-juice cocktails.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem is essentially a small town, and we were hardly anonymous visitors. A year and a half before, we had stayed in the hotel for a week, and since then, as with the other major hotels here, my wife and I had been in and out for meals and meetings dozens of times.</p>
        <p>The photo ID required by hotels of local residents like ourselves was in my case the  government press card carried by all correspondents based in Israel. So the front desk receptionist knew from a glance at the card that I was a reporter (though not my specific affiliation, which wouldn't have been of much interest to them anyway). That alone entitled us to a 10 percent discount, since the American Colony actively courts foreign journalists, who constitute a distressingly large share of Jerusalem's business travelers. And local residents are routinely given discounts at the city's better hotels.</p>
        <p>An ''executive'' double room -- with the desks and data ports that are not included in  all standard rooms -- listed for $250 a night. Children under seven (our present category) are free. Shortly afterward we were upgraded to a third-floor suite. They extended this courtesy, they said, because the suite happened to be free that evening, and we were a family of four seeking one room for one night.</p>
        <p>Room 6 turned out be an enormous stone-and-tile Orientalist fantasy. Filling a strategic interior corner overlooking the leafy courtyard, it was bathed in light from the south and west. Down an interior flight of limestone stairs from the small entry hall were two quilt-topped queen beds; a couple of petite antique writing desks; an oversized armoire; and a formal sitting area with six mosaic-inlaid straight-backed chairs, arrayed as if awaiting relatives on a chaperoned wedding night.</p>
        <p>And then there was the bathroom, a suite in itself, with a huge Jacuzzi-rigged tub. And a separate stone shower stall with multiple  jets. And terry-cloth robes. And slippers. And fresh fruit. We were home.</p>
        <p>After an afternoon swim, we had a room-service meal served quickly and decorously: a crisp Margarita pizza ($11) for the children, and a succulent ''Persian'' lentil soup ($7) for me -- good value by Jerusalem hotel standards.</p>
        <p>The cozy Cellar Bar and grassy outdoor Summer Bar are perhaps the best stocked and most aesthetically pleasing drinking spots in the city, and it is all too easy to order one of the fine cognacs or single-malt whiskeys. But inquire first. I once paid a breathtaking $50 for an ounce and a half of Bowmore. Not that it wasn't delicious.</p>
        <p>Comparing almost any hotel in Jerusalem to the American Colony is inherently unfair. This is an institution, rich in history and character. It is imbued with a sense of intimacy -- there are only 84 rooms -- not shared by any major Jerusalem hotel, upscale or otherwise. The independently managed gift shops include the city's best English-language bookstore. A string quartet offers regular recitals in an airy upstairs salon. The Middle Eastern food is excellent. Though proudly and distinctly Arab, it is a studiedly neutral meeting zone between the city's Palestinian East and Israeli West (as one of the area's few nonkosher luxury hotels, it operates fully during the Jewish Sabbath, making it a popular Friday dinner spot for secular Israelis).</p>
        <p>Novotel Jerusalem</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, feeling that I hadn't given the Novotel a proper chance, I returned, this time alone. The front desk could now give rates, and the previous estimate wasn't too far off: for my wife and me and two children the base rate would have been $227; a standard double is $151, but children 3 or older cost an additional $38 each.</p>
        <p>I was quickly and courteously booked into a seventh-floor room at a single rate of $131, a bargain by Jerusalem standards. It was an odorless, colorless, compact rectangle with a firm queen bed and adjacent fold-out couch.</p>
        <p>But it was not unpleasant: the room was bright, and impressively soundproofed. From the single large plate-glass window, I had a sweeping view over the Old City to  Mount Scopus and the Mount of Olives. A room-length desktop featured built-in shelving, a telephone with a data port, and a new flat-screen color television set.</p>
        <p>The four of us would have fitted easily, if tightly. Facilitating multiple occupancy, the small bathroom was separate from the small shower room.</p>
        <p>But two months after its opening, the Novotel was not yet ready for prime time. There was a room service button on the telephone but no room service menu. The minibar was humming but empty. Cable television choices were limited to a few Israeli channels and international news networks; there were no movies, pay-per-view or otherwise. There was no shop on the premises for newspapers or sundries, though one is scheduled to open sometime this summer. A small gym was still under construction, but it has has since opened. Heading for the pool for a pre-breakfast dip, I was surprised to find it locked; the pool area is open only from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Still, the Novotel was well scrubbed, well situated, and reasonably well run. And the buffet breakfast, in a basement dining hall, was abundant and tasty, with a good Mittel europa-meets-the-Middle East array of salads and cheeses and hummus and smoked fish.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem Hilton</p>
        <p>This hotel, which opened three years ago,  has been encroaching on the King David's official-entourage business, especially for American delegations -- either because of buy-America-first policies, or because one too many Secret Service agents has seen the King David's film clip of its fire-bombed west wing.</p>
        <p>The 385-room Hilton is a short walk from both the Old City gates and modern Jerusalem's pedestrianized center. Its cool austerity, the hard-edged creation of the ubiquitous Moshe Safdie, Israel's celebrated architect, is appealing to some, off-putting to others. The basement-level commercial gallery has a convenient assortment of trinket dealers, travel and car rental agencies, beauty parlors and a fast-service photo shop.</p>
        <p>The pool area, stark and sunlit, with comfortable chaise loungues and lots of fluffy towels, includes an outdoor Jacuzzi and a large wading pool for toddlers. You can swim from the main pool under a glass barrier directly into the small but well-equipped gym, used by President Clinton during his recent visit (there is an $11 daily gym fee).</p>
        <p>The rooms are standard American chain deluxe: strong on bathroom fixtures, short on charm, with pay-per-view movies and data ports. At a base rate of $350 for a single, $390 for a double, this is not bargain lodging. Add another $40 a night for rooms directly facing the terrific view of the Old City: if you traveled any distance to get here, you deserve to gaze on those massive floodlit walls.  With our two kids and the Hilton's no-more-than-three-humans-per-room policy, we would require a ''family room,'' for $490.</p>
        <p>Yet few customers pay the full freight. Israeli citizens, as in almost every hotel in the country, are charged 25 to 50 percent less than foreign tourists. Package tours and other regular group customers also get preferential rates. The State Department, for example, negotiates a $230 rate for a standard single, my wife learned when she stayed there for a couple of nights covering a visit by Madeleine Albright last fall.</p>
        <p>There was some spoiled fruit and a mold-covered room-service dinner abandoned in her room. It took three calls to the front desk to get it removed; rooms where guests checked out after noon could not be adequately cleaned before the next check-in, it was explained.</p>
        <p>The room itself was clean and functional, as it had been when I stayed there a few months earlier, with a king-size bed and a good work space, though surprisingly dim lighting. Its Old City view was dominated by the construction site for a long-delayed retail and office complex next door. But the bathroom, with its marble tub and separate high-pressure shower stall, was big, brightly lighted, and well stocked with plush towels and Ahava lotions and shampoos. Here was some of the deluxe pampering that might be expected from the location and price.</p>
        <p>King David Hotel</p>
        <p>For true self-indulgence, right up the street is the King David, the city's first and still its best full-service luxury hotel. Until I stayed there, though, I wasn't convinced. There is an off-putting air of officiousness to the place, an inevitable byproduct of playing official host to Israel's A-list guests for half a century. Its grand-hotel air seemed at odds with the country's essentially informal culture. And it can take half an hour to get a cup of coffee in the ornate Baghdad Deco wood-inlaid lobby.</p>
        <p>But to be a guest, we discovered, was to be treated cordially and expeditiously, all the time. Which one has a right to expect: standard rooms start at $398 for a double. For our family of four, the most economical option was a studio room listing for a heart-stopping $604 a night.</p>
        <p>Yet when we stayed one night in November the 300-room hotel, unusually, was not nearly full. Our Israeli residency, as verified again by a glance at my government photo ID card, brought the suite down to $400 a night.</p>
        <p>Then we were upgraded to a luxurious two-room ''club suite'' -- Room 338 on the southeast corner, with the unmatched King David view of the floodlit Old City walls and the great lawn and pool area that is the city's biggest and best-kept private green space. The listed rate for a club suite was $840, more than twice what we paid.</p>
        <p>Impeccably redecorated with inlaid woods and fine fabrics, the bedroom and sitting room were spacious showcases of subtle lighting and high-grade cabinetry. The big desks and two-line telephones and large-screen television sets in each room made it easy to work.</p>
        <p>Our full-course room-service dinner came in 15 minutes; it was excellent, as was the service, though the menu was mostly of the rootless Continental variety. The empty table disappeared quietly a couple of hours later -- and a small Easterish basket of plush toys and sweets appeared in its place. It was my daughter's birthday, which I had mentioned to a doting doorman; from then on, everyone working in the hotel seemingly knew that Emma had just turned 6.</p>
        <p>The most striking thing about the King David is not its opulence but its personnel, who have become an integral part of local history. Flip on the television and you are confronted with one of those welcome-to-the-hotel films one would normally click past without a thought. But this one is different. It is the story of Israel, as lived and told by the waiters and cooks and chambermaids and doormen of the King David Hotel.</p>
        <p>The video doesn't pull punches: it shows July 22, 1946, in all its destruction and carnage, when Menachem Begin's underground Irgun movement blew up its west wing, killing 91 people, most but not all of them members of the billeted British forces who were Irgun's targets. Employees vividly recall the fierce Arab-versus-Israeli fighting within rifle range of the hotel in 1948 and again in 1967 -- but they also remember the elaborate pyramid-motif cake they baked for their cherished guest Anwar el-Sadat in his historic visit in 1977.</p>
        <p>History, after all, is what Jerusalem is all about. The open rear verandas of the King David are the perfect spot to take it all in: the 16th-century Ottoman city walls, the 7th century's great gold Dome of the Rock and the many visible remnants of the far older city underneath, from Herod's massive stone foundations to the tombs and alleys of the Mount of Olives above. It is no ordinary hotel, and it is no ordinary city.</p>
        <p>Sleek new lodgings and venerable classics</p>
        <p>For the past few centuries -- or at least the past few years -- Jerusalem's innkeepers had been braced for a millennial tourist crush. New hotels rushed to open their doors, and older establishments spruced up lobbies and hired guides versed in Holy Land pilgrimage sites.</p>
        <p>But the results fell short of expectations. Though Jerusalem had a third more visitors from January to March than in the same period last year, the supply of rooms still exceeded the demand. For tourists, that was the good news. The bad news was that prices, already high for less than posh lodgings, were raised past Midtown Manhattan levels, and there they have stayed. But few people pay the full listed rates.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem is tour-group land, and whether the travelers are Christian pilgrims or furrow-browed academics or an extended family on a bar-mitzvah junket, they are probably paying a third less than do walk-in foreigners. (Israelis, by dint of nationality, get steep discounts.)</p>
        <p>Our hotel requirements are also somewhat atypical: we want a room with a well-lighted desk with a telephone, plus a port for a computer modem, plus play space for small children. We consider a pool another necessity in this hot, dry climate. Reliable room service, morning newspapers and drinkable coffee round out our list of non-negotiable demands.</p>
        <p>Forgo some or even most of that, and there are a dozen or so Jerusalem hotels that offer good to superior service. But none come cheap.</p>
        <p>In most of Jerusalem's hotels, the ''high season'' includes the entire summer; winter break from Hanukkah to the Epiphany; and the mini-seasons of Passover, Easter week and Succoth. These rates are for standard rooms as of this month.  They include breakfast buffet. Food is kosher in all hotels listed except the American Colony.</p>
