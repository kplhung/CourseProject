        <p>The Cosmos Poems</p>
        <p>By Frederick Seidel.</p>
        <p>Pictures by Anselm Kiefer.</p>
        <p>89 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $100.</p>
        <p>From Homer to Milton to Eliot, poets have always sung of the stars and planets. The fiery aerial spectacle was a commonplace in much poetry written before the last century; then, strangely, as precise scientific knowledge grew, the invocation of the spheres' music diminished. Perhaps poets felt so daunted by the rich metaphorical language produced by astrophysicists -- black holes, red shifts, light-years -- that they left minting astronomical conceits to the folks with the pocket protectors.</p>
        <p>''The Cosmos Poems,'' by Frederick Seidel, with pictures by Anselm Kiefer, was commissioned by the American Museum of Natural History to mark the opening of the Rose Center for Earth and Space. As an attempt to merge poetic meditation and scientific speculation, it is both earnest and user-friendly -- the jacket copy reports that it is about a ''universe . . . in which quantum mechanics makes friends with special relativity forever.'' If you can imagine these abstruse mathematical postulations as old buddies on a park bench feeding hypothetical pigeons, this may be your kind of cosmos -- the same starry, starry night Kiefer depicts by superimposing flowers and plants on photos of galaxies.</p>
        <p>As promised, Seidel waxes conversational about weighty matters. He aspires to Einstein's common-touch explanation of relativity -- a minute with your hand on a hot stove feels like an hour, an hour with a pretty girl feels like a minute -- but ends up sounding more like an intoxicated Bill Nye the Science Guy: ''General relativity / And quantum theory at the same table at last / Lift a fork / The size of the universe to eat a pea.'' Likewise, when we learn that ''Fifteen billion light-years is fast food / To the divine quantum equations / It is delivered to -- / Which eat the delivery boy, / According to Heisenberg.'' We also witness something as compellingly graspable as, in this case, the uncertainty principle being cute-captioned for the science-impaired. The cultures of science and art are not necessarily best joined with the folksy glue of childish perception.</p>
        <p>The author of five previous books of poetry, Seidel produces an unadorned, un-angular verse; very simple sentences and predigested images grace the opening stanza of ''Feminists in Space'': ''The stars are happy flowers in a meadow. / The grass is green and sweetly modest. / The burble of the brook / Is the thrust powered back.''</p>
        <p>The poem goes on to recount the aspirations of a 10-year-old girl for herself and her friend:</p>
        <p>We will be feminists in space,</p>
        <p>Flying toward the stars,</p>
        <p>With our backpack portable life-support,</p>
        <p>All a grownup needs,</p>
        <p>Even if there is a tether back to the mother</p>
        <p>Ship we came from.</p>
        <p>Leave your dolls behind.</p>
        <p>Opening the hatch.</p>
        <p>Given the relentlessness of cloying cliche, we might expect some small twist at the end, but alas, no:</p>
        <p>Women of the world unite</p>
        <p>Already at ten years old.</p>
        <p>Two friends are skipping home from school,</p>
        <p>Each with her own thoughts.</p>
        <p>This sort of thing -- pitched somewhat below the grade level of the girls in the poem -- can probably be explained by the implicit pedagogical component in a book meant to be sold from the museum's gift shop to schoolchildren (parents, really, with its whopping $100 price tag). But how to explain the faux Moody Blues lyrics in ''Supersymmetry'': ''Happiness is weightless. / So is love. / The chemistry of intergalactic / Space is scarcely human.''</p>
        <p>This tone of wide-eyed wonder about space exploration hardly advances its cause. Nearly 400 years ago, George Herbert keenly understood the acquisitive impulse fueling our knowledge quest: ''The fleet astronomer can bore, / And thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind: / He views their stations . . . / Surveys, as if he had designed / To make a purchase there.'' Seidel forgoes such complexities. Instead, given the job of pumping up the Rose Center, he wants us all to celebrate ''the morning of the universe,'' an easy enough thing to do alone, under the night sky, without benefit of either planetarium or poetry.</p>
