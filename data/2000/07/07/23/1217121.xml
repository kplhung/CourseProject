        <p>AMERICANS should not be taxed when they die,'' declared Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, just before the House voted last month to end what opponents of the estate tax call the ''death tax.''</p>
        <p>''The ancient Egyptians built elaborate fortresses and tunnels and even posted guards at tombs to stop grave robbers,'' he added. ''In today's America, we call that estate planning.''</p>
        <p>Not a bad line, but what about the living? Should someone be able to inherit, say, $10 million without paying any tax on it? If you cash in $10 million in stock options from starting a new company, you face a federal tax bill of as much as $2 million on the capital gains. And someone who gets a $10 million paycheck for starring in a movie or pitching for the Yankees probably pays a tax of nearly $4 million. Where's the logic in treating these people differently?</p>
        <p>There isn't any, argues William Gale, a senior fellow at the moderately liberal Brookings Institution in Washington, who recommends that the United States replace the estate tax with a true inheritance tax, or what he calls a ''transfer'' tax. This distinction is not just semantics.</p>
        <p>''The estate tax raises all kinds of emotional arguments about the tax collector reaching into the grave,'' Mr. Gale said. ''But if you think broadly about the tax system, it makes sense to tax all sources of income consistently. Ideally, a transfer of wealth, whenever it occurs, should be treated the same as any other source of income,'' with taxes on it payable by the recipient.</p>
        <p>That's not the way the estate tax works. Today, when a wealthy person dies, his estate pays a tax on the value in excess of $675,000, an amount that is scheduled to rise gradually to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are exempt up to $1.3 million. Above those limits, estates are subject to a graduated tax, with a top rate of 55 percent.</p>
        <p>In a politically popular move, both houses of Congress have voted to eliminate the estate tax within 10 years. Lawmakers rejected a White House proposal simply to raise the exemption for family businesses and farms. For the moment, nothing is likely to change, since President Clinton has said he will veto the repeal bill.</p>
        <p>But many economists contend that a true inheritance tax -- introduced as part of a broader overhaul aimed at simplifying the whole income tax system, closing loopholes and reducing rates as much as possible -- looks like a better approach than either of the alternatives currently on the table. Large transfers of wealth would be treated like other sources of income, with all the recipients paying taxes on their bequests at rates similar to those imposed on wages, interest and dividends. By broadening the tax base, rates could be lower, too. In the case of ongoing businesses, Mr. Gale recommends a method to make the payments more manageable.</p>
        <p>In fact, the United States is one of only three major countries -- Britain and New Zealand are the others -- that rely solely on the estate tax to tax transfers of wealth. Most others use inheritance taxes or some combination of the two.</p>
        <p>IT is interesting as well that some of the most thoughtful supply-siders -- those who worry that high marginal tax rates discourage work and savings -- are not necessarily opposed to inheritance taxes.</p>
        <p>''The estate tax is a very inefficient tax,'' says Alan Reynolds, director of economic research at the Hudson Institute in Washington. ''It's a major source of complexity, and the truth is that it is fairly easy to avoid. An inheritance tax, at a low rate and allowing for income averaging, avoids many of its problems.''</p>
        <p>Defenders of the existing estate tax argue that repeal would simply be a gift to those who deserve it least. And in a political system where there are many competing claims by far needier people, it would be.</p>
        <p>Moreover, keeping the estate tax provides a powerful extra incentive for wealthy people to give to charity or set up foundations, helping to soften the harsher edges of a capitalist system that has rewarded them so handsomely.</p>
        <p>But its critics have a point, too. At the top rates, a dollar of earned income left in a taxable estate yields only about 27 cents for heirs. That may encourage some high-income professionals and executives, argues Martin Feldstein, a conservative economist at Harvard, ''to retire early or simply to work less, save less and take less investment risk,'' creating less wealth for society as a whole.</p>
        <p>So why not impose a more reasonable tax -- on the heirs? Then they might decide to go out and pull their weight, too.</p>
        <p>ECONOMIC VIEW  Correction:  July 30, 2000, Sunday  The Economic View column last Sunday about alternatives to an estate tax misstated New Zealand's tax treatment of wealth transfers. The country has a gift tax; it no longer collects an estate tax upon death.</p>
