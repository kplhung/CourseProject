        <p>SPAIN has been one big happy tennis family here this week, including its latest addition, Joan Vehils, the television journalist who married Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Friday night in Barcelona, a wedding attended by 650 and featuring a cake that was bigger than the bride.</p>
        <p>''Before I finish, I would like to congratulate Arantxa and we hope everything will be great for her,'' Alex Corretja said Friday evening, to the enthusiastic applause of the Spanish news media.</p>
        <p>United they stood, divided we fell.</p>
        <p>While the American players had to talk Captain John McEnroe out of playing himself in yesterday's doubles, the Spanish captain, Javier Duarte, was extolling the virtues of his team's ''technical committee'' that selected its lineup. While Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi went to great and suspicious lengths to claim they were injured, Spain's hottest young player, Juan Carlos Ferrero, happily took a seat on the bench when the ''technical committee'' didn't name him for singles.</p>
        <p>While Sampras and Agassi looked right past the Davis Cup semifinals to the United States Open, the Spanish players blew off Wimbledon to train even harder on their beloved clay courts for their best shot at the 31-time champions from across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>''For now, everyone thinks the same way,'' Corretja said after defeating Jan-Michael Gambill in four sets and giving Spain a 2-0 lead Friday in the three-of-five-match competition. ''We sacrifice many things to play Davis Cup.''</p>
        <p>Somewhere in southern California, Sampras was yawning in the morning sun and dipping his toes into a pool as the Spaniards Corretja and Juan Balcells defeated Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, in yesterday's doubles to eliminate the United States, 3-0.</p>
        <p>Sampras had called Corretja and Albert Costa ''childish'' when they stormed out of Wimbledon in supposed protest of the seeding process. Corretja called Sampras ''lazy,'' for refusing to return to Europe and play for his country a week after dropping another Wimbledon title into his bag.</p>
        <p>''I would sacrifice an important title to win a Davis Cup for the team, for our country,'' Corretja said. ''It would be bigger than an individual prize.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it is much easier to adopt this attitude when your country has never won the Davis Cup and you are as likely to win Wimbledon or even the United States Open next month as the Americans were to survive here without their stars. Would any of these Spanish players be so happy about interrupting their French Open training to run off to Australia to play on grass? The truth is, on clay, the Americans were in trouble, regardless of which players returned the captain's call. Luck of the draw. The other day, asked what the United States' chances here would have been with Sampras and Agassi, McEnroe, who is big into percentages these days, thought it over and said, ''About 40 percent.''</p>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Americans are not the only tennis players who stiff their Davis Cup captains. Mark Philippoussis always has an excuse for Australia. As a veteran, Boris Becker feuded with the German authorities. Comfortable in Connecticut, Ivan Lendl tuned out the Czechs.</p>
        <p>If the United States has won 31 times, somebody good has usually been playing. It is not as if Sampras and especially Agassi, as young players, never gave at the office. No one hailed the Americans as national heroes when they played Davis Cup. They aren't traitors when they don't. McEnroe was always up for playing, but even that claim must be made with an asterisk. He didn't win Grand Slam titles beyond his mid-20's.</p>
        <p>Agassi turned 30 last April. Sampras will be 29 next month. With the exception of Martina Navratilova, there hasn't been a player in years who has played at the championship level into his or her 30's. At this stage of their careers, Sampras and Agassi have delicate decisions to make, considerations and preparations designed to squeeze every last Grand Slam tournament out of their bodies before they run dry.</p>
        <p>Agassi campaigned for McEnroe as captain, and signed on for a maiden voyage that took him to Zimbabwe for the first round the week after he had finished a brutal six-week road run that carried him to the Australian Open title. Agassi was on top of his game then, as fit as he has ever been. The last we saw of him in the thin air of Harare, he was vomiting into a flowerpot. He hasn't been the same since. His best surface has always been hardcourts. Should he have tired himself, delayed his Open training, jeopardized his chances to win next month in New York, by coming here?</p>
        <p>Even Corretja had to admit, finally, that the conditions for the Americans could not have been worse.</p>
        <p>''As you know, we didn't play Wimbledon and had time to practice,'' he said. ''It is pretty difficult to play Wimbledon, go home and come back to clay.''</p>
        <p>The timing of this was good for Spain. The draw was better.</p>
        <p>If Davis Cup is about anything, it is soil and surface. The Spaniards, who last reached the world group final in 1967, can now win the whole thing this year without having to leave home.</p>
        <p>''We have a good working system and the players are happy,'' said Duarte, when asked to explain his team's success, a year after a first-round loss to Brazil got the coach, Manuel Santana, fired. ''But of course, this year we are playing at home, so we are lucky. It always helps to choose the surface, your own balls and everything.''</p>
        <p>The technical committee couldn't have planned it better.</p>
