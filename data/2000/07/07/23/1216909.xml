      <abstract>
        <p>Randy Cohen The Ethicist column answers questions about whether to withdraw children from Boy Scouts because of its ban on gays, whether one may attend ethics society meetings with the intent of meeting women, whether blood donors should answer all screening questions truthfully and whether one should admonish a pizza maker who sneezes into his hands and does not wash them before resuming with the pie (M)</p>

        <p>My son has been a Cub Scout for three years, and I've been a den leader for one, a wonderful experience for us both. But I was appalled by the Supreme Court's decision upholding the Scouts' right to exclude gay people. I cannot feel proud to see my son wearing a uniform that represents bigotry, and so we are withdrawing from scouting. Many of my friends also oppose this discrimination but plan to continue in scouting anyway. Aren't they wrong to do so? -- Lynn Winter, Port Washington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Resigning as you did is the ethical thing to do. Just as one is honor bound to quit an organization that excludes African-Americans, so you should withdraw from scouting as long as it rejects homosexuals. That scouting has a legal right of free association does not clear you of this obligation. The right to shun Jews is no less anti-Semitic for all its legality.</p>

        <p>My son has been a Cub Scout for three years, and I've been a den leader for one, a wonderful experience for us both. But I was appalled by the Supreme Court's decision upholding the Scouts' right to exclude gay people. I cannot feel proud to see my son wearing a uniform that represents bigotry, and so we are withdrawing from scouting. Many of my friends also oppose this discrimination but plan to continue in scouting anyway. Aren't they wrong to do so? -- Lynn Winter, Port Washington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Resigning as you did is the ethical thing to do. Just as one is honor bound to quit an organization that excludes African-Americans, so you should withdraw from scouting as long as it rejects homosexuals. That scouting has a legal right of free association does not clear you of this obligation. The right to shun Jews is no less anti-Semitic for all its legality.</p>
        <p>Those who remain in the Scouts are on shaky ground even if they sincerely seek reform from within. That is a reasonable strategy while the issue is unsettled, but once the Supreme Court handed down its decision, the debate ended. To stay now is to accept -- if not endorse -- its policy. You need not agree with an organization's every principle, of course, but the matter in this case is too fundamental -- and too cruel -- to tolerate. Besides, all too often those who remain are not actually fighting from within; they're going on camping trips from within. Were you to find yourself transported to 1952, there would be no honor in lamenting Jim Crow and then sitting down at a segregated lunch counter and ordering a tuna sandwich.</p>
        <p>Resigning need not mean giving up the struggle. Ex-scouts can write letters, rally support and seek to reform scouting in order to rejoin one day. In the meantime, there are other, more tolerant, youth groups. The Girl Scouts and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have no similar homophobic policies; neither do many foreign scouting organizations. Scouts Canada, for instance, is particularly humane, not only rejecting sexual orientation as a criterion for membership but also authorizing specialized troops, including ones for Mormons, Cantonese-speakers and gay Scouts. Any chance of your becoming the first Long Island outpost for Canadian scouting?</p>
        <p>A male friend of mine occasionally goes to ethics society meetings where high-minded topics are discussed. He also has an ulterior motive: he wants to meet women, which he can do at the informal receptions afterward. He appears to be chasing skirts in a chaste setting. Is this ethical? -- F.K., Washington</p>
        <p>This behavior is not merely acceptable; it is admirable.</p>
        <p>Love and its neighbor, desire, are hardly unethical; they're two of life's pleasures. Your friend seems to be trying to increase the sum of human happiness.</p>
        <p>People have multiple reasons for everything they do. For example, attending church has been not just a spiritual but also a courtship opportunity for hundreds of years. As long as your friend isn't disrupting the discussion or pestering anyone with unwanted advances, I applaud his efforts. In fact, if I were establishing an ethics society, our slogan would be ''You'll come for the high-minded discourse, but you'll stay for the pulse-quickening romance.''</p>
        <p>When I went to donate blood, I found myself answering yes to several screening questions. An example: ''Have you (a man) had sex with a man since 1979? Have you traveled to Britain since 1995?'' I have a fair amount of medical training (I will receive my M.D. shortly), so I know the implications of these questions -- and I also know that my donation would present no risk. Is it ethical to tell a few white lies for the greater good of contributing to the blood supply? -- D.S., Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>No, you must answer honestly. Remember, your blood alone is not the only issue here. The integrity of the screening process would be compromised were it known that donors lie whenever they feel confident about the safety of their blood or the excellence of their med-school learning.</p>
        <p>In addition to securing the current blood supply, accurate information is necessary to develop future screening methods. Take the screen for the predominantly transfusion-borne hepatitis C, for example, which has been in place 92. ''Much of what was learned was gleaned from retrospective analysis of donor demographics,'' says Dr. Serena Yoon, an attending physician at Cayuga Medical Center and senior clinical instructor at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, even if your blood is unacceptable for transfusion, it may still be valuable. Some agencies accept blood from people with certain risk factors and use it for research. So fill out the questionnaire accurately, and let the collection service decide how best to use your blood.</p>
        <p>Recently, I was in a pizzeria where a pizza maker sneezed into</p>
        <p>his hands and, without washing them, continued to make the pie. Besides determining never to eat there again and hoping every other pizza maker is more fastidious, did I have an obligation to confront him about his toppings? -- A.O., New York</p>
        <p>Absolutely! Yuch! You should have said something to the pizza maker or the manager, otherwise someone will end up eating what is not so much a pizza as a pepperoni hanky.</p>
