        <p>The MetroStars keep marching over opponents the way they were stepped on last season, when they finished last in Major League Soccer.

        <p>The MetroStars keep marching over opponents the way they were stepped on last season, when they finished last in Major League Soccer. After today's 4-2 triumph over the Miami Fusion at sunbathed Giants Stadium, the MetroStars have the most points (41) and most victories (13) going into the league's All-Star Game next Saturday.</p>
        <p>Alex Comas, the Colombian striker who seems to be getting timely goals, led the MetroStars with two goals. Adolfo Valencia, the other Colombian striker, and Petter Villegas scored the other goals for the MetroStars (13-7-2), who posted their fifth consecutive victory and are undefeated in their last nine (7-0-2).</p>
        <p>''We got a little naive at the end,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano of the MetroStars said, alluding to Miami's two goals, in the 60th and 90th minutes. ''but I can't take anything away from the effort by the guys. They came out in the second half and put the game away.''</p>
        <p>Comas, who scored the opening goal in the 2-0 victory at New England last Saturday, scored the first one today. It was his fifth goal of the season. This time the goal came in the 39th minute on a play that was started by Roy Myers, who split two defenders with a precision pass to Comas.</p>
        <p>Comas stepped into the space at the precise time to receive the pass and eluded goalkeeper Nick Rimando with a move to his left. That pleased the predominately Colombian crowd, which came to see Deportivo Cali play Luis Firpo of El Salvador in an exhibition following the M.L.S. game.</p>
        <p>After he scored, Comas sprinted to the northeast corner of the stadium where he was handed a Colombian flag. He celebrated with his teammates for several seconds before he returned the flag to the fans.</p>
        <p>Villegas was involved in the second and third MetroStar goals. The speedy and crafty Villegas was pulled down in the penalty area by Tim Sahaydak in the 48th minute after a good run on the right. Valencia took the penalty kick with plenty of composure for his 10th of the season.</p>
        <p>Six minutes later, Villegas started and finished the third goal. Taking a pass on the right, he ran with the ball for about 25 yards before passing to Valencia. Villegas kept running, and that enabled him to get to the rebound from the shot by Valencia for his fifth goal of the season.</p>
        <p>''We play with more emotion,'' Villegas said. ''We want to prove to our fans that we're worth watching. We got into a habit of losing last year, but we have such a great change in attitude now. We play with so much confidence. We feel we can beat anybody.''</p>
        <p>Comas scored the fourth goal in the 59th minute when he stepped into space from a good pass by Mark Chung and flicked the ball to the far corner, securing the fifth consecutive victory for the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>''Comas has been getting clutch goals for us,'' Zambrano said. ''He's been working hard and he wants to help the team in every way he can.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Defender MIKE PETKE of the MetroStars was ejected in the 78th minute for a violent foul on MARTIN MACHON of Miami. . . . JAY HEAPS and ROY LASSITER scored for Miami, after the MetroStars led by 4-0. . . . Midfielder BILLY WALSH of the MetroStars served a one-game suspension for his ejection last Saturday in the victory at New England. . . . The MetroStars will play Tampa Bay in a third-round United States Cup match Tuesday night at Mitchell Field in Uniondale, N.Y. TAB RAMOS and CLINT MATHIS, who were with the national team for a World Cup qualifying game Sunday in Costa Rica, will play for the MetroStars. . . . JULIAN GOMEZ, from Nassau Community College, made his debut for the MetroStars, playing the last 15 minutes in place of ADOLFO VALENCIA.</p>
