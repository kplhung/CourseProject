        <p>New Jersey is using a natural resource -- star power -- to boost its new campaign for the arts. Actors including Avery Brooks, Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep are helping promote the state's ''Discover Jersey Arts'' effort, intended to make residents and visitors more aware of the Garden State's theaters, museums, galleries and concert halls. One television ad features a sultry Ms. Sarandon, who was born in Edison, traveling on the New Jersey Turnpike and stopping to collect a few stares as well as a brochure about the arts. Other celebrities in the campaign, which began this month, have ties to the state; some, such as Mr. Brooks (''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''), are residents. ''Expect the unexpected,'' the campaign advises. Does that means Tony Soprano is next up, leading a tour of the Performing Arts Center?</p>
