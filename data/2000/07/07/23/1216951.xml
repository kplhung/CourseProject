        <p>Jody Rosen, in his interesting article on popular music [''Two American Anthems, in Two American Voices,'' July 2], says, ''It's time to pitch a musical big tent: time to scold the lover of a Gershwin tune who can't hear the beauty in James Brown, in the Notorious B.I.G., in Lucinda Williams; time to celebrate the common tradition that links 'The Yankee Doodle Boy' and 'Hellhound on My Trail' and 'Stardust' and 'Respect' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'Nuthin' but a G Thang.' . . .''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jody Rosen, in his interesting article on popular music [''Two American Anthems, in Two American Voices,'' July 2], says, ''It's time to pitch a musical big tent: time to scold the lover of a Gershwin tune who can't hear the beauty in James Brown, in the Notorious B.I.G., in Lucinda Williams; time to celebrate the common tradition that links 'The Yankee Doodle Boy' and 'Hellhound on My Trail' and 'Stardust' and 'Respect' and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'Nuthin' but a G Thang.' . . .''</p>
        <p>I'm one of those Gershwin lovers whom Mr. Rosen would like to scold and I object to the ''musical big tent'' theory. It's time to stand up for excellence and separate popular culture (''Nuthin' but a G Thang'') from art (all of the Gershwin brothers' songs). A song like ''Nuthin' but a G Thang'' is an example of teenage performance art but has no lasting, musical relevance and is unlikely to be performed very often in the future. Whereas I'm willing to bet the farm that in another 100 years ''Stardust'' will be as well known as it was when it was written.</p>
