        <p>At 5:20 p.m. sharp on Thursday, Dr. Richard R. Rutter, 68, took off over Indiana in a hot air balloon dressed as the Wizard of Oz in a top hat and frock coat with nine plastic pigs on it.</p>
        <p>In real life, Dr. Rutter is a professor of orthodontics at the School of Dentistry at the University of the Pacific at San Francisco. But for 10 brief minutes until he drifted down to an athletic field, Dr. Rutter imagined that he was the Wizard himself on his way to the Emerald City, pulling baby pigs out of his sleeves and letting them run up and down his shoulders. ''Oh, I felt very wizardly, yes,'' Dr. Rutter said, after landing.</p>

        <p>At 5:20 p.m. sharp on Thursday, Dr. Richard R. Rutter, 68, took off over Indiana in a hot air balloon dressed as the Wizard of Oz in a top hat and frock coat with nine plastic pigs on it.</p>
        <p>In real life, Dr. Rutter is a professor of orthodontics at the School of Dentistry at the University of the Pacific at San Francisco. But for 10 brief minutes until he drifted down to an athletic field, Dr. Rutter imagined that he was the Wizard himself on his way to the Emerald City, pulling baby pigs out of his sleeves and letting them run up and down his shoulders. ''Oh, I felt very wizardly, yes,'' Dr. Rutter said, after landing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rutter was one of some 400 Oz fans who came to Indiana this weekend to celebrate the centennial of L. Frank Baum's book, ''The Wizard of Oz.'' The event was sponsored by the International Wizard of Oz Club, and the group was here to honor the timeless story of a little girl, Dorothy, who is blown out of Kansas by a cyclone and encounters a wizard who lives in an Emerald City and promises to help her find her way home.</p>
        <p>The publication of ''The Wizard of Oz'' in 1900 ushered in ''a new era of American children's literature,'' Michael Patrick Hearn, an Oz scholar, said in the celebration's keynote address. ''The fairy is eliminated -- and the fearsome morality.''</p>
        <p>''Baum dared to offer delight without instruction,'' Mr. Hearn said.</p>
        <p>Since then, ''The Wizard of Oz''  has worked its way into the national psyche as a fable of eternal hope in which things are not always as fearsome as they seem, even lions are cowards, Wizards are just pretending to be fierce, and it is always best to be at home. ''It's like a religion,'' said the author Alison Lurie, who was here to give a talk. ''It has its holy relics, its laity, its clergy,'' the Baum descendants and the heads of the Oz fan clubs.</p>
        <p>With five million copies sold until it went into the public domain in 1956, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was the Harry Potter of its time. It is impossible to know how many of the Oz books have been sold since then, said Mr. Hearn, who is the author of an annotated version of the ''The Wizard of Oz.''  But Mr. Hearn estimates that more people have seen the 1939 MGM movie of ''The Wizard of Oz'' with Judy Garland, and more times, than any other movie. A centennial version of Mr. Hearn's book is being published this September by W. W. Norton.</p>
        <p>At the celebration, there were lectures on every aspect of Baum's life and work, displays of Oz collectibles, and a church service with an Oz theme. Three of the original Munchkins from the 1939 movie came.</p>
        <p>Gita Morena, a great-granddaughter of Frank Baum, appeared wearing a pair of silver shoes like Dorothy in the book. On Thursday, Ms. Morena, the author of ''The Wisdom of Oz,'' gave a talk on how she uses Oz in her psychotherapy practice. Ms. Morena said her original name was Dorothy, but she changed it in 1981 to Gita at the suggestion of an Indian mystic. ''I believe the magic key was given to me to open the doors to sympathy and understanding,'' Ms. Morena said, quoting her great-grandfather.</p>
        <p>''We travel together through the inner world to find our way,'' she said. ''Initiates must travel through the chaos of the windstorm to find the storm's center point.'' And, Ms. Morena said, ''Even though the journey is difficult, success is possible.''</p>
        <p>One theme running through the celebration was Baum as a champion of women's rights.</p>
        <p>Fred Erisman, a professor of literature at Texas Christian University, said in a talk that Baum's mother-in-law, Matilda Joslyn Gage, a drafter of the Woman's Bill of Rights with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, exerted a major influence on the author. On Friday, Ms. Lurie lectured on ''Oz and the New Woman.''</p>
        <p>All the activities at the celebration were centered at the Indiana Memorial Union, which was decorated with 300 pounds of red silk poppies in honor of the Deadly Poppy Field that Dorothy encounters on her way to the Emerald City. A mock yellow brick road led through the lobby to a 15-foot-high replica of the Emerald City on the stage of Alumni Hall, with 40 Munchkin mannequins, and a pair of huge red ruby slippers. Indiana was chosen as the site of the celebration, said Peter E. Hanff, president of the club and deputy director of the Bancroft Library at Berkeley, because of the extensive collection of Oz material in the University's Lilly Library, which was on display for the event.</p>
        <p>Many of those attending were collectors. One of the best-known in the group was Edith Hollister of Santa Barbara, Calif., famous among Oz fans for owning the actual pencil with which Baum wrote the first Oz book.</p>
        <p>''You're never too old to have a happy childhood,'' said Lee Jenkins, a paralegal who owns an Oz store.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rutter attended the Friday afternoon costume party wearing his Wizard costume with the pigs on it. There was another attendee dressed as a field of poppies, and one as a yellow brick road with a hat meant to represent the Emerald City. There were several Dorothies, ''traditional,'' younger-looking Dorothies, based on the drawings of W. W. Denslow in the first Oz book, and Judy Garland Dorothies based on the movie.</p>
        <p>All in all, it was a dizzying array.</p>
        <p>''This is a really marvelous event,'' said Mel Rubin, a lawyer and mediator from Key Biscayne, Fla.,  as he watched Dr. Rutter take off in his balloon. Mr. Rubin, who is 56, had come to Bloomington with his wife,  Susan Scholz, a psychologist. Mr. Rubin said he had been captivated by the Oz books ever since the Wicked Witch scared him when he was 5 or 6 years old. His wife doesn't share his interest in Oz, Mr. Rubin said. ''She just sits there and relaxes and realizes what a mistake she made.''</p>
        <p>Still, said Mr. Rubin, ''I wish more people would do this. I think they'd leave each other alone, if they'd just concentrate on the Wizard and all the great things in the Emerald City.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 26, 2000, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a festival in Bloomington, Ind., to celebrate the publication centennial of the Oz books truncated the original title. It was ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' The article also gave a misspelled surname in some copies for an actor who played a Munchkin in the 1939 movie based on it. He is Clarence Swensen, not Swenson. In some copies the article also misspelled the name of the theater where a play, ''Oz,'' was staged as part of the festival. It is the Buskirk-Chumley, not Bushkirt-Chumley.</p>
