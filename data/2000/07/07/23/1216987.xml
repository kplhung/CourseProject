        <p>ANYONE noting that Glen Campbell is scheduled to appear Tuesday at the Paper Mill Playhouse might legitimately ask: Which Glen Campbell?</p>
        <p>Will it be the one who played an intimate five-night engagement at Feinstein's in New York in May, just him on acoustic guitar and his friend Jimmy Webb, the songwriter, on piano? Or will it be the one who filled the Hollywood Bowl this month, backed by a 70-piece orchestra? Will it be the gospel one or the one who has enjoyed success on the casino circuit?</p>

        <p>ANYONE noting that Glen Campbell is scheduled to appear Tuesday at the Paper Mill Playhouse might legitimately ask: Which Glen Campbell?</p>
        <p>Will it be the one who played an intimate five-night engagement at Feinstein's in New York in May, just him on acoustic guitar and his friend Jimmy Webb, the songwriter, on piano? Or will it be the one who filled the Hollywood Bowl this month, backed by a 70-piece orchestra? Will it be the gospel one or the one who has enjoyed success on the casino circuit?</p>
        <p>The answer, Mr. Campbell said the other day in a telephone interview, is that it will be something more than the acoustic Glen but something less than the orchestral one. There will be his country-tinged band. There will be his daughter, Debby, who will join him on a tune or two. And there will be yodeling.</p>
        <p>''Hank Williams music -- it just doesn't go away, for some reason,'' Mr. Campbell said, explaining where the yodeling is likely to come in. Williams's music seems ever-popular with audiences, and Mr. Campbell's voice is a natural fit for some of the country legend's songs.</p>
        <p>''I got a bigger hand on 'Lovesick Blues' one night than I did on anything else,'' he said, still sounding surprised. As he should, because Mr. Campbell, of course, has plenty of ovation-inducing hits of his own. Those who are partial to them won't be disappointed on Tuesday, he said.</p>
        <p>''Of course I do 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix' and 'Wichita Lineman' and 'Galveston,' because that's what they come to hear,'' he said. ''But there will be some new things, too.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Campbell burst out of the obscurity of studio musicianship in 1967 -- his versatile guitar work had brought him steady employment from Nat King Cole, Merle Haggard and many others -- he instantly embodied the word ''crossover.'' His songs climbed both the pop and country charts, and he soon crossed mediums as well, getting his own television show.</p>
        <p>Now, at 64, he faces perhaps the most daunting crossover of all: appealing to younger generations. He thinks he's managing fine, as is evident from the matter-of-fact answer he gives when asked what age group constitutes his concert audiences these days.</p>
        <p>''I'd say 9 to 90,'' he said. ''I get people out there who bring their parents.''</p>
        <p>Credit his current drawing power to a 30-year-old television show, ''The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour,'' which ran on CBS from 1969 to 1972.</p>
        <p>''I think it has a lot to do with the TV audience,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''The kids who saw me on TV when they were 10 are coming to concerts now.'' And a segment that has been running on VH1 lately has helped introduce him to today's youth.</p>
        <p>For more evidence of Mr. Campbell's crossover credentials, see the golf courses around Phoenix, the city he has called home for 18 years. There, he said, he can sometimes be seen teeing off with Alice Cooper. That's right, Alice Cooper, of garish rock fame.</p>
        <p>''That's a likely pair, isn't it?'' Mr. Campbell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper is mellower than he once was, and so is Mr. Campbell, who went through the familiar celebrity-takes-a-fall stage in the late 1970's and early 80's. Alcohol, he said, was his biggest problem, though there was some drug abuse as well. Now, a strong religious faith guides him.</p>
        <p>''I'm running my life according to what I know to be true from the Bible and the old scribes,'' he said. Some gospel recordings in the last decade have attested to his convictions, and a Christmas album released last year was nominated for a Grammy Award for best Southern, country or bluegrass gospel album.</p>
        <p>The personal serenity he seems to have found may be giving his music a new depth. Reviewers often remark that his voice -- except for the yodeling, of course -- is smoother and more nuanced than ever before, and Mr. Campbell says his playing has found a more even keel as well.</p>
        <p>''I used to be just a total jazz freak,'' he said. ''People used to say, 'Where's the melody? Is there a melody in there anywhere?' Now I let the music follow the song.''</p>
        <p>GLEN CAMPBELL  Paper Mill Playhouse, Brookside Drive, Millburn.  Tuesday at 8 p.m.  (973) 376-4343.</p>
