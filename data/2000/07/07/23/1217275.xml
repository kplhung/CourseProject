        <p>Delaware Democrats are hopeful that Gov Thomas R Carper, now finishing his second and final term, can unseat Republican Sen William V Roth Jr, who is seeking his sixth term; both men tend to be middle-of-the-road politicians; biggest issue is expected to be age: Roth is 79 and Carper is 53 (S)</p>

        <p>Delaware is a little state. But this year's Senate race there looms large -- and, after last week, even larger.</p>
        <p>The state's senior senator, William V. Roth Jr., a Republican, is going after a sixth term, and Democrats think that in Gov. Thomas R. Carper, now finishing his second and final term, they at last have the candidate who can take him out.</p>
        <p>If they are right, not only will Delaware get a brand-new senator, but the 10-seat Republican edge in the Senate very well might be narrowed. In only four or five other states are Democratic hopes about the Senate as high.</p>
        <p>Little wonder, then, that on Monday, when Delaware's Democratic senator, Joseph R. Biden Jr., introduced Mr. Carper at a rally celebrating the official kickoff of the Carper campaign, he declared, ''This election is a big deal.''</p>
        <p>It became even bigger the next day with the release of a new Mason-Dixon poll.</p>
        <p>Early polls had Senator Roth trailing Governor Carper by 10 points or so. The new poll had him down by only 3 points.</p>
        <p>Both men tend to be middle-of-the-road politicians with few sharp edges, which is the way Delawareans like their politics. So what separates the pair more than anything else is age: the senator turned 79 yesterday; the governor is 53. And age is what both are focusing on.</p>
        <p>In his kickoff speech, Mr. Carper used the words ''energetic'' and ''future'' and the phrase ''new leadership'' no fewer than a dozen times. Then, in his most pointed reference to Mr. Roth's 79 years -- 30 of them in the Senate and four in the House -- Mr. Carper said:</p>
        <p>''For more than a third of a century, through the tenures of seven presidents, Bill Roth has served the state of Delaware in Washington. But this election, like all elections, is not just about the past, it is about the future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth did not respond with his usual litany about having the seniority to deliver to constituents in the future what no freshman senator could ever hope to deliver. Rather, he pointed to the new poll numbers and said, ''Our campaign is right where we want it to be.''</p>
