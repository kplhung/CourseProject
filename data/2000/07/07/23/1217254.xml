        <p>The New Jersey State in Camden is reaching far beyond the state waters for its latest exhibition, Conservation Outreach and Observation Lab or C.O.O.L., which opened this month. C.O.O.L., which features unusual animals of South and Central America, the Caribbean and the Pacific and Indian Oceans, is designed to promote conservation of endangered and threatened species and habitats. The keel-billed toucan from South America, which has a rainbow-striped beak, is part of the new South American bird aviary. A coral reef with colorful and unusual fish has been added. Other exhibits include such animals as the South American coypu (shown), a cousin of the beaver. The female of the furry, three-foot long animal has mammary glands on its back so it can feed its young while it is swimming. The Indo-Pacific C.O.O.L. animals include the Banggai cardinal fish, which is part of a breeding program at the aquarium designed to save the species from extinction.</p>
