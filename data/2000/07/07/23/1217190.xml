        <p>The American Embassy in Paris phoned officials of the U.S. Postal Service bicycle team a few days ago to ask when it would be convenient on Sunday for Lance Armstrong to receive another congratulatory call from President Clinton.

A few months after that, the rider visited the White House to give the president a bicycle and a helmet.</p>
        <p>That is the standard star treatment, as were Armstrong's appearance on the David Letterman show and his visit to the New York Stock Exchange, where he became the second athlete residing in Austin, Tex., to ring the opening bell.

        <p>The American Embassy in Paris phoned officials of the U.S. Postal Service bicycle team a few days ago to ask when it would be convenient on Sunday for Lance Armstrong to receive another congratulatory call from President Clinton. The two last spoke on the phone a year ago, hours after Armstrong won his first Tour de France. A few months after that, the rider visited the White House to give the president a bicycle and a helmet.</p>
        <p>That is the standard star treatment, as were Armstrong's appearance on the David Letterman show and his visit to the New York Stock Exchange, where he became the second athlete residing in Austin, Tex., to ring the opening bell. (Ricky Williams, the former University of Texas running back, was the first after he won the Heisman Trophy in 1998.)</p>
        <p>So what awaits the Tour de France's leader and certain winner when he visits New York again on a publicity blitz Tuesday? A ticker-tape parade? A speech to a joint session of Congress later in the day? The stakes have changed. Nearing a second consecutive victory in the world's greatest bicycle race, Armstrong appears to be rising from what his agent calls ''the clutter'' of mere stars to superstardom.</p>
        <p>''That level has less to do about money, annual endorsement fees, than becoming a household name,'' the agent, Bill Stapleton, said. ''That level is Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Wayne Gretzky. Lance is joining them.''</p>
        <p>At least publicly, Armstrong himself scoffs at such talk. Interviewed from an adjoining car as he rolled through the German countryside Friday morning on a training ride before a long individual time trial, he said with a laugh, ''I'm not a superstar, I'm a regular guy.''</p>
        <p>Whichever, he was relaxed and friendly, bantering at 40 kilometers an hour (25 miles per hour) as he worked up a sweat and readied his legs for his 58.5-kilometer race (about 36 miles) against the clock four hours later. ''A regular guy,'' he repeated, ''and I'll show 'em what a regular guy can do.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that is the way Jordan, Woods and Gretzky talk the talk too. Discussing those superstars, Stapleton said that Armstrong has been ''in the tier right below them'' with endorsements in the range of $5 million to $7.5 million a year, a realm that he explained was occupied by the top 20 to 25 athletes. To an agent, especially a witty one with a hot property, that is ''relative obscurity'' in the United States.</p>
        <p>In Europe, however, Armstrong vaulted into superstardom with his first victory, three years after he learned he had spreading testicular cancer and had to undergo three months of chemotherapy. Bicycle racing is a major sport here, usually second only to soccer, and the winner of the Tour de France is widely honored.</p>
        <p>Ari Burgh, a vacationing Dutchman standing by the side of the Tour's road in Switzerland this week to cheer the riders, summed up the European reaction to Armstrong: ''He's a great hero. What he's done touches the imagination. The cancer, that too, but really because he won the Tour and now he's winning it again.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, bicycle racing remains a niche sport and the magnitude of Armstrong's comeback seems not to have taken hold until this 87th Tour de France started July 1. The Texan captured the overall leader's yellow jersey 10 days later and has held it securely ever since.</p>
        <p>''It's much bigger than last year,'' Jim Ochowicz, Armstrong's close friend and his former coach with the defunct Motorola team, said of Tour coverage in the States, ''and so is Lance. He's in the Jordan-Gretzky class now.'' Ochowicz credited Armstrong's autobiography, ''It's More Than the Bike,'' published this spring and still high on the best-seller lists, with introducing him to a large audience.</p>
        <p>''He's become known as a great American hero, not just a great American athlete,'' Stapleton said with an agent's hyperbole. ''It's a sport most Americans basically don't understand, so his marketing focuses on the depth of what he's been through.</p>
        <p>''The beauty of the Tour is its linear time element. A golf tournament lasts four days. The Super Bowl, even with all the hoopla, is six hours. The Tour goes on for three weeks.''</p>
        <p>A half-dozen major companies have signed Armstrong to endorsement contracts, including Nike, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Yahoo and Visa. Many of their executives are part of the entourage at the Tour, and more are arriving daily before the finish in Paris on Sunday.</p>
        <p>John Kouten, associate director of public affairs for Bristol-Myers Squibb, flew in this week with nine cancer survivors from a handful of countries. They will meet with Armstrong, who heads a cancer foundation in his name, and sign with him the Charter of Paris Against Cancer.</p>
        <p>''Lance is going to reach a much broader audience,'' Kouten said. ''Many more people in the United States are going to know his name now with a second victory. Last year, some folks might have thought that his victory was a fluke. Now he had a whole other year to relapse from his cancer and he didn't. That's a very encouraging message.''</p>
        <p>Nike has had Armstrong, 28, under contract for a half-dozen years.</p>
        <p>''Lance is very important to our brand and I think he's becoming more important,'' said Scott MacEachern, emerging sports marketing director for Nike. ''He is already a big story. If Lance is fortunate enough to win this Tour, I think he will be a very big story going into the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong is not overly enthusiastic about leaving his wife and infant son to go to the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, in September, noting that he has participated in the Games twice before, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 as an amateur and Atlanta in 1996 as a professional.</p>
        <p>Then why is he going? ''Go ask Bill Stapleton,'' he replied jovially.</p>
        <p>For a superstar, it's always business before pleasure.</p>
