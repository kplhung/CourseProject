        <p>CITY OF NEW YORK PARKS &amp; RECREATION  www.nyc.gov/parks</p>
        <p>During his tenure as Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern has created more than 1,600 acres of parkland, planted more than 80,000 trees and reopened 15 recreation centers. Now he has added a revamped Web site to his growing emerald empire.</p>
        <p>The original site, introduced in 1998, offered a mix of cartoon drawings, fact sheets and information about select parks. ''It was useful to reporters and others,'' one staff member said.</p>
        <p>After a one-year overhaul, the site has been renamed and offers new features, like virtual tours and online forms, that are intended to draw more people to the city's parks. A new data system is also being installed to ensure that news about each park, like future events, is complete and current.</p>
        <p>''A lot of parks are underutilized,'' said Mr. Stern, who introduced the site at a Times Square ceremony on Tuesday. ''With this site, the city's park system is literally at your fingertips.''</p>
        <p>The site was underwritten by a $125,000 donation from EarthLink, an Internet service provider.</p>
        <p>The redesign is part of Mr. Stern's campaign to improve what he calls ''customer service.'' In another example of the initiative, a handful of staff members spend several hours each month phoning various park officials and logging the time it takes to reach a live person.</p>
        <p>''We try to fight the plague of voice mail,'' Mr. Stern said. ''The Web is a method for expanding the community's choice.''</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- A verdant home page highlights the site's newest offerings. ''Did You Know?'' provides online forms to apply for street trees, athletic permits and lifeguard jobs. Also showcased here is an interactive game for budding park architects and virtual tours of flagship parks.</p>
        <p>''Things to Do'' offers a searchable calendar of future events and ongoing attractions. In ''Your Park,'' visitors can zero in on their local parks, learning about tree varieties, reporting dead trees and the like. Another section describes the history of the Parks Department and park rules and regulations, and provides contact information for department officials.</p>
        <p>The site also includes an online store where visitors can order Parks Department caps and T-shirts, view archives of news releases and reports, and scan listings of job opportunities.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- Viewers can visit the sites of more than two dozen ''green'' groups, including Project for Public Spaces, Trees New York and the City Parks Foundation. The site also provides links to environmental advocates, like the Green Guerrillas.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET A revamped site to steer New Yorkers to the city's 1,700 parks, beaches, pools and recreation centers.</p>
