        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Shame on these Yankees, who are willing to besmirch the honor of their great heritage by tolerating a coward like Roger Clemens because he is their thug. Clemens's tacit admission that his successful pitching career depends upon his intimidation of opposing batters by deliberately throwing inside pitches (including at the head of those batters and obviously above the strike zone) deserves more than mere public name-calling. Sportswriters, baseball players and fans should use their influence on those sportswriters who cast ballots for the elections to Baseball's Hall of Fame to deny Clemens that honor.</p>
