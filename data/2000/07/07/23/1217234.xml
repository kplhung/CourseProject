        <p>As mayor of New York from 1966 to 1973, John V. Lindsay dominated the municipal stage in an era when racial strife and labor strikes flared in the city.</p>
        <p>Like mayors before and since, he was esteemed and excoriated. Supporters saw a leader whose vigor and good looks made him a compelling spokesman for the nation's cities. They said that his walks through poor black neighborhoods helped the city avert the devastating riots then exploding in other cities, and that he improved conditions for the poor.</p>
        <p>Detractors saw a ''limousine liberal'' indifferent to the anxieties of the white working and middle classes. They said his spending and borrowing helped bring on the city's fiscal collapse during the term of his successor, Abraham D. Beame.</p>
        <p>But all that was three decades ago, and the din of those days has long dissolved. Now 78 and ailing, Mr. Lindsay lives far away from the scene of his former spotlight, having moved last November to a retirement community on Hilton Head Island, S.C. He and his wife, Mary, had lived in Old Lyme, Conn., since 1997, when they gave up their Manhattan apartment.</p>
        <p>Parkinson's disease has left Mr. Lindsay in a wheelchair most of the time, and it has reduced his speech to short, often indistinct phrases uttered with difficulty, Mrs. Lindsay says. He has had two heart operations and two strokes, and his eyesight is failing.</p>
        <p>''But his mind and memory are very good,'' she said recently by telephone from their home, and he ''likes seeing people.'' He does not bring up his mayoral days, she said, but is interested in what is going on in New York. ''We've talked about the state campaigns,'' she said, and ''he feels badly'' about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Lindsay took the phone.</p>
        <p>What does he think of Mr. Giuliani as mayor? ''He's doing very well.''</p>
        <p>How does he view the Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio? ''I think the gal will win.''</p>
        <p>Does he think about his days in public life? ''I think about the good times.''</p>
        <p>First elected mayor when he was 43 and a Republican congressman from Manhattan, he lost his renomination bid in the 1969 primary, but then won re-election as the Liberal Party candidate. Sour times would most likely include his failed effort in the 1972 Democratic presidential primaries -- he became a Democrat in his second term -- and his loss in the party's 1980 Senate primary. After leaving City Hall, Mr. Lindsay practiced law until the mid-1990's.</p>
        <p>Former aides and other New Yorkers still telephone and visit him.</p>
        <p>''He has pictures all over the house of the great moments of his career,'' said Lewis Rudin, the real estate developer, who visited Mr. Lindsay recently.</p>
        <p>And Sid Davidoff, a lawyer and lobbyist who was Mr. Lindsay's administrative assistant in City Hall, said, ''Whatever his body and facial features, his deep blue eyes still shine.''</p>
