        <p>Cousin Helen went to India once and never needs prodding to talk about the trip. Nestled in a cozy Indian restaurant, her tales flow like the Ganges itself: There's the one about the snake charmer who wouldn't let him take his picture unless she gave him 100 rupees. Or the one about the elephant guide who charged her pennies to ride his lumbering pachyderm down a canyon, and a hundred times that to get back up. And Helen's description of the Taj Mahal -- a shimmering marble jewel in a sea of poverty -- is likely to move one to tears. The backdrop for her latest reverie proved equally powerful. Karma Kafe, a stylish ''Indian bistro'' owned by Mehernosh Daroowalla, host of the more traditional India on the Hudson in the Mile Square City, offers a nifty seven-day-a-week lunch special for budget-minded folks who hate fussing with menus. Only $8.95 and you eat for as long as you can take the heat. Gurmeej Singh, the chef, has assembled the perfect sampler of popular dishes: tandoori chicken, saag paneer (creamed spinach cooked gently with Singh's handmade cottage cheese cubes), dal tandoori (hot lentil sauce) to spoon over your pea-and-rice pulao. There's chicken curry, peas and potatoes, and plenty of naan to sop it all up, not to mention a bowlful of dill yogurt to cool your palate for dessert. That dessert'll be extra, big spender, but worth the splurge. The regular menu offers Indian dishes for us chic western types: tandoori wraps and crawfish vindaloo, anyone? There's a hip-looking bar, a window seat, and a televison that, alas, does not broadcast classics from Indian cinema. Your own tales of the East will have to suffice; Cousin Helen does not do parties.</p>
