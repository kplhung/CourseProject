        <p>The Hillary Trap</p>
        <p>Looking for Power</p>
        <p>in All the Wrong Places.</p>
        <p>By Laura Ingraham.</p>
        <p>228 pp. New York: Hyperion. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton has never quite seemed to rise to the level of rancor her critics have directed at her. The quantity of venom just isn't appropriate for a woman who, as her current opponent in the New York Senate race keeps pointing out, hasn't really done much. But reading Laura Ingraham's book, ''The Hillary Trap: Looking for Power in All the Wrong Places,'' clears up the apparent disconnect. Mrs. Clinton, it turns out, is responsible for everything bad that currently afflicts American society except, possibly, the World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>Lousy schools, Internet pornography, heavy-handed bureaucrats, the Columbine massacre: Ingraham says if you look closely, you'll see Hillary's hand in all of them. In a chapter-length rant, she even lays New Age religion at the First Lady's door. (For someone who's usually so touchy about religion-bashing, Ingraham is pretty quick to make fun of the way other people choose to worship.) ''In discussing New Age beliefs and goddess worship, I'm not suggesting that Hillary Clinton actually endorses these notions,'' she writes. ''Rather, I want to show what lies at the end of the slippery slope down which Hillary has taken a cautious first step.''</p>
        <p>We get quite a bit of that particular construction in this book. Ingraham is forever dredging up worst-possible-scenario anecdotes about federal busybodies and nutsy ''gendercrats,'' then announcing that although this isn't really Hillary's fault, it is anyway:</p>
        <p>''Hillary Clinton didn't invent this absurd game'' -- Equity, an antisexism board game -- ''and the inane gender obsession it represents. But the educational climate that produces these howlers was created by her friends and allies.''</p>
        <p>''Hillary isn't personally responsible for the highhanded dealings of every government agency, of course -- though one can legitimately wonder what kind of entrepreneur-unfriendly policies she would pursue if elected to the Senate.''</p>
        <p>''Hillary may not explicitly tell us it's wrong for women to defend ourselves with guns. . . . Yet the so-called gun control movement, whose standard-bearer Hillary has become, is indeed permeated with extreme antigun ideology.''</p>
        <p>Although Hillary Clinton's name shows up on almost every page of this book, she's actually only a vague specter. ''The Hillary Trap'' is, in fact, a compilation of the political philosophy of Laura Ingraham, conservative lawyer and television talking head. But -- perhaps because putting one of the Clintons on the cover vastly improves any book's chances of getting noticed -- Ingraham has turned Hillary into a stand-in for everything she dislikes about the legacy of the 60's, from old-line feminists to people who oppose school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Ingraham's spin is that Hillary and her co-conspirators are in collusion to keep women dependent, either on men or, more likely, on Big Government. She has to do some pretty heavy pounding to make all the things she doesn't like appear to be a part of this plot. Consider, for instance, her attack on gun control. Ingraham claims that Clintonista feminists want to wipe out weaponry because they ''really don't want women to be so self-reliant that they won't need Hillary's governmental 'village' to look out for them. They'd rather see women as a 'protected class' than as people who can fight their own battles, using the same weapons as men.''</p>
        <p>What we have here, folks, is a writer who practices what she preaches against. Railing against a ''gender'' lobby that turns every liberal cause into a battle for women's rights, Ingraham turns every political movement she opposes into a conspiracy to deprive women of their self-reliance. When the Congressional women's caucus and its supporters seek more money for medical research into women's health issues, she says, ''Essentially, we're being patted on the head and told 'Now, now, little ladies, we'll look out for you, and you just honor and obey your protector.' ''</p>
        <p>Ingraham makes some interesting, if familiar, points about the way the current race to pander for the women's vote might be screwing up the way we set our national priorities. But it's one thing to question whether there's too much pork in the Violence Against Women Act. It's another to say we ought to stand up on our own two feet and find a cure for breast cancer ourselves.</p>
        <p>Ingraham is one of the most famous of a much-publicized group of mediagenic young female conservatives, and is perhaps best remembered for her appearance on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in a leopard-skin miniskirt. She's irritated that people keep bringing up that incident, and complains that ''Clinton feminists'' have indulged in ''reverse wolf whistling'' by attacking her and her colleagues for being attractive. Hillary, she admits, ''has not engaged in this feminist misogyny,'' but she's responsible anyway, because ''what she has done is help create the atmosphere in which this intolerant view of womanhood is acceptable.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the book, Hillary Clinton has not only legitimized adultery, driven female entrepreneurs out of business with insane overregulation and made the world safe for magic crystals, she's also responsible for the legend of the spotted miniskirt. Will that woman stop at nothing?</p>
