        <p>Acquisition of Santa Barbara News-Press from New York Times Co by Wendy P McCaw, one of wealthiest, if not best known, women in US, has been billed as victory of community spirit over homogenizing influence of a distant corporate overseer, but McCaw insists she does not invest in assets for purely sentimental or other nonbusiness reasons; McCaw is estimated to be worth $1.5 billion; she paid about $100 million for News-Press; photo (M)</p>

        <p>FEW cities do a better job of smoothing the rough edges of movie moguls and business gladiators than this quaint, impeccably groomed seaside paradise 100 miles north of the shark-infested studio commissaries of Hollywood. The wealthy often come here not to forget who they are, but to take a break from some of the forces that made them rich.</p>
        <p>Which is why the recent announcement that the local newspaper, the 145-year-old Santa Barbara News-Press, had been sold by a large publishing company -- The New York Times Company, as it happens -- and acquired by a local philanthropist was received in some circles as a victory of community spirit over the homogenizing influence of a distant corporate overseer. ''It has to be quality before the bottom line,'' said Wendy P. McCaw, the buyer, who paid roughly $100 million. It seemed that an act of public spirit had drawn one of the wealthiest, if not best known, women in America out of her shell.</p>
        <p>And yet, Ms. McCaw, 48, demonstrated the hard business acumen that she uses to manage  a fortune that Forbes magazine has estimated at about $1.5 billion, most of that a product of her divorce from Craig O. McCaw, the telecommunications entrepreneur. When it was suggested in an interview -- she supplied written answers to written questions -- that she may have made the investment for altruistic reasons, she crisply shot down the notion.</p>
        <p>''This acquisition fits with my investment philosophy and meets my I.R.R. targets,'' said Ms. McCaw, using the Wall Street language for internal rate of return. ''I don't invest in assets for purely sentimental or other nonbusiness reasons.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McCaw's acquisition stands in counterpoint to a trend in which large chains have been gobbling up small publications and using economies of scale to wring out higher profits. She has said not only that she will avoid layoffs and leave the newsroom alone, but that she will also explore environmentally sound alternatives to using newsprint made from tree pulp.</p>
        <p>THE acquisition will also provide an opportunity to find out just what Ms. McCaw is made of as she cautiously -- so cautiously that an assistant leapt at a photographer snapping a shot of her near her unmarked office on a quiet street here -- steps onto a stage she has long avoided.</p>
        <p>She gave a rare personal interview to her own newspaper after the deal was announced, but insisted that no photographs be taken. When she first visited the newspaper after the purchase, she casually strolled the five or so blocks from her office and introduced herself to the staff. But it was on a Saturday, when the offices were all but empty.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCaw is an avid jogger and a vegetarian,  well known for her divorce from Mr. McCaw. The two met while undergraduates at Stanford, where she was known as Wendy Petrak. She was at his side as he cleverly assembled a nationwide cellular communications empire, which he sold in 1994 to AT&amp;T for $11.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The two separated shortly afterward, in January 1995, and then engaged in an expensive divorce battle that ended in her placing business ownership over cash. She became something of a business partner of her former husband, taking large stakes in several companies in which he had invested, including Nextel Communications, in which she now owns 4 percent, according to public filings, and Nextlink Communications, in which she owns a reported 14 percent through her investment company, Ampersand Holdings.</p>
        <p>SHE has said she protects her privacy in large part because of security concerns, but in response to a question she added that being a woman was also a factor. When it was pointed out that billionaires from Steve Jobs to Donald Trump lead public lives, she responded: ''They are all men -- some of them happen to enjoy the spotlight. I'm not and I don't.''</p>
        <p>And though she is quiet, she is not anonymous. She formed the Wendy P. McCaw Foundation, which has more than $53 million in assets, to finance some of her favorite projects. These have ranged from returning Keiko, the killer whale that starred in the movie ''Free Willy,'' to the waters around Iceland, to preserving architectural drawings.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCaw was so involved in freeing Keiko that in January 1996, when the animal was flown from Mexico to a temporary home in Oregon, she was on board the chase plane.</p>
        <p>''Wendy was very personally involved,'' said David Phillips, executive director of the Earth Island Institute, which managed the project. ''She'd come up to see him when we had him in a sort of rehab in Oregon. She has continued to provide funds to help in his eventual release.''</p>
        <p>He added that when a reception celebrating the journey included platters of seafood, she was incensed.</p>
        <p>''What's going on?'' Ms. McCaw demanded to know, said Mr. Phillips. ''We're supposed to be saving this stuff, not eating it.''</p>
        <p>Her stewardship of the newspaper could prove a challenge. Most experts agree that the paper is likely to be a reliable if unspectacular investment. It is expected to take in about $30 million in revenue this year and earn pretax income of $4.5 million to $6 million, company officials say.</p>
        <p>''We'll have good, steady growth, but it won't be explosive,'' said Allen Parsons, the publisher.</p>
        <p>Or, as Edward J. Atorino, a media analyst at Wasserstein Perella Securities, commented, ''It's in an affluent area, but there's limited growth.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McCaw said she would do well, while respecting the paper's independence.</p>
        <p>''I will not have any role in the news-gathering or reporting process,'' she said. ''I would hope that no friend or acquaintance of mine asks me to intercede with the paper; but if they did, I would tell them what I just told you.''</p>
