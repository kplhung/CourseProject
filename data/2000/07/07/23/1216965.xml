        <p>FOR much of its 23 years, the million-square-foot Seaview Square shopping center here has been overshadowed by the area's older and larger Monmouth Mall, five miles north in Eatontown.</p>
        <p>Last month, however, new owners bought the foundering shopping center, at the juncture of Routes 35, 66 and 18, and plan to convert both the way it looks and the type of stores that give it its character. The cost is estimated at $67 million, including the $17 million purchase price paid to the seller, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The mall is being converted into what merchandising specialists call a ''power center,'' which is defined by the International Council of Shopping Centers in Manhattan  as an open-air retail strip with at least 250,000 square feet and three or more large discount specialty outlets, or so-called big box stores. Seaview Square's conversion to such a center will be made through a process called demalling: replacing most of a mall's smaller stores by large tenants, eliminating its common area and turning it inside out so that its stores face the road.</p>
        <p>Ocean Township officials have rezoned the Seaview Square site for the conversion. And Starwood-Heller L.L.C., the new owners, will retain the two active anchors -- Sears and Value City, with 200,000 square feet each -- and convert them to free-standing buildings. The more than 3,000 existing parking spaces will also be retained.</p>
        <p>But the mall's remaining 600,000 square feet will be razed. That space includes what had been a third anchor, a 180,000-square-foot building that was a Stern's, and a separate movie theater, as well as some 40 smaller stores, about half of which are vacant. The remaining retailers lease their stores on a month-to-month basis and will relocate, according to Starwood-Heller, which is a joint venture between G. Heller Enterprises of Edgewater, a developer of residential, office and retail properties, and the Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>The owners will demolish the old mall once all approvals from the township are secured, which is expected this fall. Construction of the new center will follow in the next year.</p>
        <p>As now envisioned, the new center, which will keep the Seaview Square name, will have three big-box retailers, including Target, a discount department store, and Lowe's, a hardware store. Both have signed on to lease land on the site for 150,000-square-foot stores, which they will build themselves, said Gene Heller, a partner at Starwood-Heller.</p>
        <p>There will also be a supermarket of up to 60,000 square feet, a central food court and about a dozen smaller stores, totaling 150,000 square feet. Annual rents are expected to be $13 to $20 a square foot. Future plans may also include a 400,000-square-foot office structure, if a tenant to occupy the  building can be found.</p>
        <p>''The existing mall is nearly desolate,''  Mr. Heller said. ''But the cost to buy so large a piece of land at the intersection of three highways was a good value and a good start. We think added value can be accomplished here.''</p>
        <p>Those prospects please Terrance D. Weldon, the mayor of Ocean Township, who said the mall was the largest taxpayer in his 14-square-mile community of 28,000 people. Over the years, as the mall lost its tenants and panache, he said, successful tax appeals by the owners cut the revenue to the township from more than $1 million a year in half. Once the mall is converted, Mayor Weldon said, estimates are that the lost annual tax revenue will be restored.</p>
        <p>Many retail brokers said Seaview Square's chances of success this time were enhanced for several reasons. Among them is that the population in that eastern section of Monmouth County has increased enough over the years to support more stores, said Jonathan Schultz, president of the Schultz Organization TCN, a real estate services company in Woodbridge.</p>
        <p>A demographic study done by Equitable showed that as of 1998 there were 144,000 people with an average annual household income of $61,614 living within a five-mile radius of Seaview Square.</p>
        <p>Its conversion is also taking place as the state's economy is healthy and the retail market relatively strong. ''Though retailers are expecting sales to be down 1 to 2 percent this year, the numbers will still be good,'' said Ted Kraus, who heads TKO Retail Advisors, a consulting firm in Mercerville.  He said the weakness was due to a leveling off of the consumption frenzy of the last few years. Still, he said, rental rents are rising and the overall retail vacancy rate in the state is less than 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The planned conversion of Seaview Square makes sense, Mr. Kraus said, because it reuses a large tract of suitably zoned land, a dwindling commodity in the state. And the popularity of such ''power centers,'' he added, continues to be fueled by the expansion of big-box retailers like Target and Lowe's.</p>
        <p>Matthew Harding, a vice president at the Levin Management Corporation, a retail management concern in North Plainfield, added, ''These are tough times for moderate-sized enclosed regional malls, which need to be up-to-date to compete.'' He said that as a power center Seaview Square would complement rather than compete with the 1.4-million-square-foot Monmouth Mall, and with newer retail centers like the 10-year-old, 1.4-million-square-foot Freehold Raceway Mall in nearby Freehold Township.</p>
        <p>When Seaview Square opened in 1977, it was seen as a ''a major benefit to the township because it was constructed on the site of a former closed landfill, ridding us of an eyesore,'' Mayor Weldon said. It was built by Equitable in partnership with the Goodman Company of Philadelphia. The insurer bought out its partner in 1981.</p>
        <p>The mall was successful at first, only to lose momentum when just three of the four planned anchors opened up.. Its downward slide continued as the Monmouth Mall siphoned off shoppers. In 1992, Equitable renovated Seaview Square, but that did not succeed in turning the mall around. In 1996, Stern's and the movie theater closed, spurring many of the smaller retailers to leave.</p>
        <p>Last month, Equitable sold the mall. The sale was part of ''Equitable's strategy to reduce its equity investments in real estate to a core group of assets,'' said Mary Beth Lally, an associate at Lend Lease Real Estate Investments in Manhattan, which advises the insurer on real estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heller of Starwood-Heller said his company was working with township officials on the design of the new center to meet their concerns that it ''be extensively landscaped and intelligently done.''</p>
        <p>Under preliminary plans drawn by Keith Michaels, the company's architect, the two existing anchors will be bookends to the new Seaview Square. In between them, the Target store will rise, as will a two-story retail component housing the smaller stores. The other two big-box stores will be to the north of them where the site significantly rises, enabling all to be visible from the highway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michaels said that the areas around the buildings would be landscaped and that although all the stores would have their own exterior entrances they would be connected by walkways. There will also be a two-story food court that he said would be the center's focal point.</p>
        <p>''The concept,'' he said, ''is to thread together all these disparate big pieces to create a community, rather than a power center where each big box is an island onto itself.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Weldon said community reaction to the project ''so far has been positive'' because it will revitalize a failing center and be built on recycled land, not pristine property. But there are worries over increased traffic.</p>
        <p>To address those concerns, Mayor Weldon said talks were under way with Starwood-Heller to help pay for enlarging an intersection at Route 35, which will be a fourth entrance to the site. He said that the township had received a $175,000 grant from the state for the $300,000 highway project and that he hoped Starwood-Heller would contribute the rest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heller said that his company ''knows the conversion will work'' because of the initial responses of retailers like Target and Lowe's. When asked if keeping the Seaview Square name would be a deterrent, given the mall's history, he said: ''The mall may have been known for all the wrong reasons, but it was certainly known. And when we change it, people will want to see what it has become.''</p>
