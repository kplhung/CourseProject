        <p>It wasn't meant to be, a Davis Cup in his maiden captain's voyage. If John McEnroe needed more evidence that his boat was sinking right along with the afternoon sun, he got it in the second game of the fifth set of the doubles match here today.</p>
        <p>It was break point for Spain, already ahead by 1-0 in the decisive set, but there were Todd Martin and Chris Woodruff, tall and strong, near the net, sending Alex Corretja deeper and deeper behind the ad court, in the corner, almost to the runway leading off the court.</p>
        <p>The Americans kept hitting overheads. Corretja kept finding a way to flick them up in the air, high across the net.</p>
        <p>''Chris hit a couple early in the point and I said, 'Don't hit it to Corretja,' '' Martin would say later. ''Then I got one, the easiest one and I hit it to Corretja.''</p>
        <p>And then the ball was back again, the last time from almost an impossible high backhand angle, Corretja saving the ball from plopping into a tree-like plant.</p>
        <p>''The most amazing point I ever played,'' Corretja would say. A point the Spaniards would eventually win when Juan Balcells shanked a backhand winner into the open court.</p>
        <p>''That's one of Alex's greatest qualities -- his defensive skills,'' Martin said, sadly.</p>
        <p>The Americans would recoup that fifth-set break but the symbolism of Corretja's athletic returns and sheer refusal to give up on a point were the story of this Davis Cup semifinal, settled today by Spain's makeshift doubles team of Corretja and Balcells, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3.</p>
        <p>The victory gave Spain an insurmountable 3-0 lead with the meaningless reverse doubles still left for Sunday.</p>
        <p>Having never won the Davis Cup and without an appearance in the world group finals since 1976, Spain will play Australia in the December final, as the favorite on the clay-court surface that suits its players' style so well.</p>
        <p>McEnroe had considered today the best United States chance to win any match here, after Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi pulled out, citing injury. He had contemplated playing himself, though it was probably a good idea he didn't. While neither Spaniard has ever been an accomplished doubles player, their heavy topspin returns and lightness afoot would have been even more overwhelming for a 41-year-old than it was for Martin and Woodruff.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, before his players talked him out of playing, McEnroe had talked tough, asking, ''Who the hell is Juan Balcells?'' Today, he found out and wound up paying him a compliment, sort of.</p>
        <p>''He's strong as an ox,'' McEnroe said, before adding, ''He's got the greatest 83 mile-an-hour serve in the history of tennis.'' The fact that Balcells' first-service percentage was 88 wasn't lost on Captain Mac either.</p>
        <p>As for his own patchwork crew, McEnroe credited Martin and Woodruff for playing a game match. But, far more than the fifth set, they would go home lamenting a first set, which Martin failed to serve out at  5-3, wasting two set points. In the tie breaker, they had set point twice more but couldn't convert. Particularly frustrating was Martin choosing not to volley a Corretja backhand up the line, thinking it was long. The ball dropped, a foot inside the baseline, in the doubles alley.</p>
        <p>It was, with added tension, the same story as Friday's singles. ''Missed opportunities,'' McEnroe said, wearing a Yankees cap in his postmatch news conference. ''The first set was ours. No way in the world we should have lost that set.''</p>
        <p>Woodruff, the fifth-match hero of the first round in Zimbabwe, took the blame, saying he played with a ''little too much fear,'' not going for volleys when Martin served for the set, at 5-3.</p>
        <p>The United States forced a fifth set by winning a fourth-set tie breaker, went down a break early in the fifth, rallied back on serve, only to cough up serve and, in effect, the match in the eighth game.</p>
        <p>Martin flubbed two forehand volleys for 0-30. Just to make sure he put one in play, he sent the next volley into Corretja's wheelhouse for a forehand pass down the T. On the first break point against Woodruff, Corretja nailed a backhand up the line, sending the crowd into a chanting, flag-waving frenzy.</p>
        <p>Corretja proceeded to serve out the match at love, with Balcells kissing off the last three volleys. A wild celebration ensued, with the Spanish players dancing in a circle and later circling the court to spray Champagne at the fans in the front rows.</p>
        <p>McEnroe took the defeat well, for him. Without Sampras and Agassi, he knew he had the wrong team, on the worst surface. He couldn't even argue calls on clay, where the ball leaves a mark, so he kept his complaining to a hosing down of the court between the fourth and fifth sets. He later said it had been agreed only to water the court -- which makes it play slower and plays to the Spaniards' favor -- after the second set.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to say we lost the match because they watered the court,'' he said, clearly mellowed by the harsh reality of modern recruiting.</p>
        <p>His best players didn't come. The draw was not good. For McEnroe, it's on to Chicago next week, back to the comfort of the Seniors Tour.</p>
