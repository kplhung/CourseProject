        <p>The National Park Service has recently designated two new national recreation trails -- the Columbus, Ga., Black Heritage Trail and the Sarah Zigler Interpretive Trail in Jacksonville, Ore.</p>
        <p>The trail in Columbus, Ga., is an urban route emphasizing the city's African American achievements and history. Starting at the house where the blues singer Ma Rainey lived, the nine-mile trail winds through the city stopping at 30 places of note, including the Liberty Cultural Theater, recently restored, where Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway performed, and Spencer High School, the town's first high school for African-Americans. A brochure detailing each stop is available from the Columbus Convention and Visitors Bureau, 1000 Bay Avenue; telephone (706) 322-3181.</p>

        <p>The two-and-a-half-mile hiking and biking trail with views of the Siskiyou and Cascade Mountains was named for an early settler, whose original gold claim along Jackson Creek was donated by her granddaughter for the trail.</p>
