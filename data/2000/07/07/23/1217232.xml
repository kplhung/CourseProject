        <p>A fire that engulfed a house in Brooklyn early yesterday, killing a 13-year-old girl and injuring at least 18 other people, appears to have been intentionally set, officials said.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the fire, which quickly spread, appeared to have been started on the fifth floor with a flammable liquid.</p>
        <p>The girl who died, Sharon Simms, was visiting a friend's apartment for a slumber party that began the previous night, neighbors said. She was killed in the fire, a two-alarm blaze that broke out about 2:50 a.m. and swept through a brick building at 27 Brevoort Place in Bedford-Stuyvesant, police officials said.</p>
        <p>Paramedics took the most seriously injured victim, Diane Carter, to the New York University Medical Center's burn unit, where she was in critical condition last night, officials said. Ten firefighters and eight other people were treated for smoke inhalation, slight burns and other minor injuries at hospitals, they added.</p>
        <p>The fire started on the fifth floor of the five-story brick building, where the girls were sleeping, officials said. Ms. Simms, who lived a few blocks away on Grove Street, was found with severe burns in the building, officials said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>More than 120 firefighters responded to the alarm, officials said. It took about an hour to bring the fire under control, said Firefighter Mike Prendergast, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>After hours of sifting through charred debris, fire marshals and police investigators determined that the blaze had been intentionally set.</p>
        <p>''It was deemed arson, and they are investigating it,'' Firefighter Prendergast added. ''It is almost entirely a police matter now.''</p>
        <p>Officials said several arsons have occurred in recent months in Brooklyn. In June, Ramon Sanchez, 26, was arrested in connection with at least 19 fires in the Bushwick section, including one that killed a child. He is being held at Rikers Island while he awaits trial.</p>
        <p>Sgt. James Foley, a police spokesman, said investigators had determined that flammable fluid had been used as an accelerant in yesterday's fire. Police officials said few other details were available and they were continuing their investigation.</p>
        <p>Neighbors who were awoken by the blaze said its flames reached out of the building's windows.</p>
        <p>One resident whose clothes had caught on fire survived by jumping from a fourth-floor window, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Several other people jumped out of windows to escape, the witnesses added.</p>
        <p>''It was one of the scariest things I have ever seen,'' said Florence Simmons, a neighbor who was awoken by the crackling of the flames.</p>
