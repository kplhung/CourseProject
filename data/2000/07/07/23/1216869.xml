        <p>Barnet/Morley  Arlene Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. To Aug. 3. (631) 324-2823.</p>
        <p>Structured to highlight work by two major artists and to explore aspects of 20th-century printmaking as well, this pair of solo exhibitions features etchings from the 1930's and 40's by Will Barnet and etchings and lithographs by Malcolm Morley from the 80's and 90's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnet's earliest themes reflect the social realism that dominated Depression Era art. ''Desolation,'' a view of several despondent homeless figures in a barren industrial area, is among the most successful examples and is also a good demonstration of the way the artist modernized delicate, crisp lines by giving them a swift, sketchlike character.</p>
        <p>In general, it is the bolder pieces that have held up best, however.  These range from a strong urban view of Mr. Barnet's hometown, Beverly, Mass., developed with rich, deep tones, to bold abstractions, ''The Rooster'' and ''The Spider,'' that suggest the artist's mid-century investigations into how his art could be descriptive but at the same time take its integrity from the relationships between invented shapes.</p>
        <p>The exuberance associated with Mr. Morley's well-known paintings is also present in his large, vibrantly colored prints. There are similar pictorial dynamics, too, with dreamlike, shallow spaces containing a disparate assortment of objects and figures. The imagery is personal, and is often drawn from childhood experiences with ship models. Global travels inspired a number of selections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morley's frequently assertive blend of threatening objects rendered in toylike colors lends a quirky sparkle and suggests a rambunctious, constantly youthful mind. Several pieces also suggest the loose and fractured surfaces that he has explored in watercolors and then translated to larger works.</p>
        <p>Kanovitz/Perlman  Clark Fine Art, 51A Job's Lane, Southampton. To July 30. (631) 283-5844.</p>
        <p>Major pieces by the painter Howard Kanovitz and the sculptor Joel Perlman provide a good view of both careers in this meaty exhibition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanovitz's selections, which span two decades, touch on a number of the ideas he has pursued, particularly the experiments that combine subjective content with new ways of handling format, composition and technical details. The grainy monochromatic blur characterizing the waterscape image in ''Spring Tide'' suggests a concern with the way memories are saved, while the heavy glass-paned door construction in front of the painting addresses the notion of barriers.</p>
        <p>''Fire Island Still Life,'' with its elaborate foreground depiction of food and reading matter, gives the impression of sequential episodes by focusing on a couple walking away from the household setting and across the beach toward a distant scene of bathers. Shadows cast by the walkers, and a striking scheme of body limbs and beach fencing in ''Near By Pharos,'' make a point about the role of structure as a sub-theme in the Kanovitz work.</p>
        <p>The soaring majestic bird that appears in a number of examples from the 90's conveys the impression of a symbolic motif and inserts a metaphysical element that is sometimes hard to reconcile with the artist's otherwise intriguing explorations of realism and perception.</p>
        <p>Known best for pared down abstract compositions executed in welded steel or bronze, Mr. Perlman has recently been investigating the movement and compressed energies possible in circular forms. Most of them here are quite successful.</p>
        <p>Particularly notable are pieces that activate interior and exterior spaces, often by interrupting a churning, modified spiral with unexpected angled shapes. This can introduce a sense of restlessness and agitation that makes even the smaller works seems powerful.</p>
        <p>'3D'  Elaine Benson Gallery, 2317 Montauk Highway, Bridgehampton. To July 31. (631) 537-3233.</p>
        <p>As its title implies, this group show concentrates on art that is three-dimensional. The surprise comes from the lively mix of freestanding and wall-mounted examples. While some of the wall pieces are reliefs, others are seeking an opportunity for a greater assertive thrust through placement at eye level.</p>
        <p>This is especially true of Jeffrey Meizlik's wonderfully otherworldly bronzes, which treat themes of death and burial with a finesse that turns rough, commonplace shapes and surfaces into haunting allegories. Most combine a small bird form with large volumetric abstract units. In ''Rune Stone,'' the bird lies surrounded by small vertical abstract appendages that could be mourners or the remnants of a cage.</p>
        <p>Proximity to the viewer's eye helps sharpen awareness of the fragility that is part of the content in ''Marauder,'' the most successful of Grace Sutton's pieces. In a double play on the idea of physical process, layers of thin papers are applied in overlapping, scalelike fashion to a sculptural shape that looks as if it were liquid frozen in the course of its irregular flow.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Claudia Redel's scenes painted within, around and over containers contribute to the tradition of evocative boxes. Some place a miniature animal or a crawling infant on a foreground ledge to introduce uncertainty about the nature of illusion.</p>
        <p>The gallery's most monumental room presents examples of creative furniture by Nico Yektai. A corner table blurs the boundaries between art and function and takes on a bit of a conceptual thrust by sculpturing its own angled wall in dark toned verticals of uneven height.</p>
        <p>Several artists, including Amy Zerner and Irwin Perton, are showing substantial bodies of work that deal with appropriated images, fantasy and the imagination. Mr. Perton's chairs are covered with twists and comments on famous artists. His homage to Georgia O'Keeffe, for example, places her likeness in the center of a cow skull and covers the seat with an interpretation of her assertive flowers.</p>
