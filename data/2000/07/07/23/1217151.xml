        <p>Bad times produce good design. After Chrysler's near-death experience in the 80's, its collective brain turned out the useful minivan, the cab-forward sedan, the mucho-macho Ram truck.

        <p>Bad times produce good design. After Chrysler's near-death experience in the 80's, its collective brain turned out the useful minivan, the cab-forward sedan, the mucho-macho Ram truck. The creative juices of a design team headed by Tom Gale and John Herlitz jelled into jaw-dropping shapes like the Atlantic show car, the Viper supercar, the Prowler street rod and the PT Cruiser (attributed to Bryan Nesbitt, 31).</p>
        <p>But fine design cannot exist in a vacuum, and one secret of Chrysler's success was a management that encouraged risk-taking. In particular, Robert A. Lutz, who rose to vice chairman, went to bat for proposals he liked, staving off the committee-think that often dulls sharp ideas.</p>
        <p>Much has changed. Mr. Lutz retired. Daimler-Benz acquired Chrysler. Many talented people defected. A new top designer, Freeman Thomas, hasn't yet made his mark, but one wonders if corporate conservatism has set in; DaimlerChrysler's other '01 models -- new midsize cars, redesigned minivans -- don't set off the same sparks. Will the PT Cruiser be the last testament to a remarkable confluence of the right people in the right company at the right time?</p>
