        <p>HAL BECKOFF is that rare thing in the quiet towns of Westchester: a prophet. ''I believe the veil has been lifted from my eyes so that I can see,'' he said in the Mamaroneck apartment where he lived with a friend for most of the last two years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckoff, who is 60 and unemployed, does not hear voices or see visions, and he has never suffered from mental illness. He is not a member of any church or organized religion. But he believes that he has discovered the truth about God and the Bible, and has written up his beliefs in a book titled ''Mystery of God Revealed.''</p>
        <p>It is his second book. The first, self-published several years ago, is also titled ''Mystery of God Revealed.''</p>
        <p>''It was such a good title, I couldn't resist using it again,'' he said. But the new book represents his latest thoughts about God's mysteries, which he believes could change the world.</p>
        <p>If all this sounds a little unusual for Westchester, so is Mr. Beckoff's life story. After a solidly middle-class career as a legal typist in Manhattan, he was unable to make the shift to using a computer at work. The firm he worked for, Garbarini &amp; Scher, was patient with him for years, and finally began docking his pay. He left, and when his savings ran out he struggled unsuccessfully to find a new job. Finally, he was evicted from his apartment and was on the verge of homelessness almost two years ago.</p>
        <p>He was taken in by Robert Suval, whom he had met when both were working as extras on the film ''The Siege,'' and who lives in an apartment owned by his parents in Mamaroneck. Mr. Suval, who grew up in New Rochelle, has had his own struggles with work. He sells ice cream from a truck seven months a year and works part time in a pizza parlor the rest of the year. He was married and had two children, but his wife left him, he said, because he was unable to provide a home for her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckoff and Mr. Suval represent the kind of downward mobility that has become all but invisible in recent years, at least in wealthy communities like Mamaroneck. The economic boom of the past decade has created the illusion that anyone can find work, making life harder -- or more humiliating -- for those who are falling out of the middle class.</p>
        <p>And in a sense, Mr. Beckoff's religious beliefs -- like those of many prophets before him -- represent an effort to transcend the struggles of his life. The mystery he claims to have discovered in the Bible can be boiled down to one word: reincarnation. He believes that we will all have a chance to redeem our failures in a future life, or many future lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckoff is the first to admit that he is no scholar and that his discoveries are sheer intuition. ''God does some truly outrageous things,'' he said, like causing people to suffer in famine and war. ''But if you impose reincarnation on the Bible, you can see how God can tell people to do such horrible things -- they will have to face that karma somewhere down the line.'' For the last year and a half, Mr. Suval and Mr. Beckoff have spent much of their time discussing God in Mr. Suval's apartment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suval, who was raised Jewish but does not attend any synagogue, said he had found Mr. Beckoff's faith inspiring. ''Being with Hal, I was able to see a way of being saved -- I can see a way to go out with my head held up high, even though I didn't have any accomplishment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Suval, Mr. Beckoff never doubted that his failures were providential. When he did not find work he did not despair. ''I realized I was being held back, that I was not supposed to find work. Instead of hitting my head against the wall, I decided God wanted me to trust.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Beckoff's trust in God may have gone too far. In early May he left Mamaroneck for a homeless shelter in Manhattan. ''I know something is going to rescue me,'' he said in an interview a few days before he left. ''I know my book is meant to get out there. I know I'm protected.''</p>
        <p>So far, he has not found a job, but he has found friends at the homeless shelter where he has been living at 41st Street and Ninth Avenue. And his faith in his destiny has not wavered.</p>
