        <p>They once prayed for rain here, looking heavenward for lasting relief from the droughts that had cracked the earth and withered their crops. But that was last summer, and the two before that.</p>
        <p>Now these farmers can't pray enough for the rain to end.</p>
        <p>Since April, torrential downpours have washed away newly planted seed, drowned sweet corn and peas before they could be plucked, and transformed acre after acre of fertile soil into lifeless muck. Rain-battered farmers throughout the stretch of western New York from Syracuse to Buffalo say they expect to lose half their crops -- worth millions of dollars -- to the worst rainy season they can remember in at least 50 years.</p>
        <p>''Most of us feel there's almost nothing that can't be overcome,'' said Nicholas Breslawski, 52, who prayed in church last Sunday for cloudless blue skies. ''But this rain, it's been hurtful down into your soul because it's one thing we've been unable to control with our own hands. You can beat things with will, but you can't beat constant rain.''</p>
        <p>In what has become a test of faith for many farmers, unexpectedly heavy rain and hail have devastated crops all over the state, from apple orchards to wheat fields, and pounded a state agricultural industry already teetering from depressed food prices and low profit margins. Gov. George E. Pataki has requested federal disaster aid for farmers in more than 30 counties. None has been granted yet.</p>
        <p>''During a year when fuel prices are at their peak and commodity prices are weak, the excessive rain that the state has been experiencing could be the final straw for many farmers,'' Governor Pataki said in a written statement. ''It is critical that we help these farmers withstand these disastrous weather conditions,  as they serve as the backbone for our rural communities.''</p>
        <p>The rains have fallen especially hard in outlying areas of Monroe County surrounding Rochester, where thick corn stalks brush up against neat subdivisions, and dairy cows graze along the roadside.</p>
        <p>The county's 605 farms produced $41.9 million worth of crops in 1999, or roughly 4 percent of the state's $1 billion in crop sales, according to the most recent estimates from the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
        <p>Since April, storm systems have stalled here and poured down more than a foot of rain -- twice as much as last spring. In June alone, rain fell on 22 days and set a record for that month. ''I don't expect it to turn dry anytime soon,'' said Jeff Warner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University who monitors weather patterns in western New York.</p>
        <p>Many farmers had hoped for a bountiful harvest when the rains came earlier this year. But then their fields flooded. And the rain just kept falling. ''We went from one extreme to another,'' said Bob King, an agricultural specialist for the Cornell Cooperative Extension in Monroe County. ''There won't be any profit for most farmers. They'll be lucky if they cover their costs. It's another nail in the coffin, because we've been having tough times anyway.''</p>
        <p>With mounting anger and frustration, these farmers and their families are forced to wait out the heavy rains. ''I have woken up in the middle of the night hearing the rain, and lay there not being able to get back to sleep because I'm thinking of them not getting into the field,'' said Ann Breslawski, 48, who is married to Nicholas Breslawski. ''I watch the lightning and I pray, 'Please God, don't let it rain.' It affects you. It's on your mind all the time.''</p>
        <p>The surviving crops still carry scars. Corn stalks are a foot or more shorter than they should be at this time of year. Wide swaths of wheat fields lie flat on the ground and have begun to turn black from mold. The soggy pea fields, which are being harvested by hulking machines, have been pockmarked with tire tracks.</p>
        <p>And the farmers say they can no longer find joy in a rite of spring here -- driving by a neighbor's fields to peek at the crops in a bit of friendly competition. ''There are no good-looking crops this year,'' said Mr. Breslawski as he pointed to his 1,000 acres of cabbage and soybeans. ''I can take you to a field so bad that I can't stand to look at it. Now I say, 'My field is worse than yours.' ''</p>
        <p>Rodney Stettner, 48, a farmer who lost 30 acres of peas out of 200 and all 400 acres of feed corn to the rain, said he would probably have to borrow money to plant next year's crops. The constant rain has darkened his mood and cast a gloom over his home -- so much so that his wife, Patricia, says she often wants him to stop farming.</p>
        <p>But as reliably as the frost comes every fall, Mr. Stettner and many others say they will return to their fields again after the storms and droughts have passed. ''There's a great sense of accomplishment in growing a crop,'' Mr. Stettner said. ''There's a lot of pride in what we do. That's the reason we stick with it.''</p>
        <p>At St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Church last Sunday, the 8:30 a.m. Mass was unusually well attended by farmers who tend to disappear into their fields at that hour, even on Sundays, during the growing season. Mr. Breslawski and his family came. So did their friends and neighbors in this rural community. It had rained again the night before, making the ground too wet to work that morning.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Paul Ryan prayed for the struggling farm families, as he has done many times before. Then his members stood together in the wood-and-stone church and sang an inspiring hymn: ''Jesus gave to me, I'm going to let it shine, let it shine, let it shine, let it shine.''</p>
        <p>''The prayers aren't magic,'' said Father Ryan as he looked outside at gray skies. ''I think it would be fair to say God is challenging us.''</p>
