        <p>Judith Shulevitz deplores cultural trend in which creative people have to be good looking to move their products; holds commodification of artists and writers may be off-putting, but it is neither new nor all that deplorable; argues that what is particular today is emphasis on looks; asserts that the image--the face, the body, compressed into two dimensions--has become 'lapidary bit of shorthand' (M)</p>

        <p>Sooner or later, the television industry was bound to come up with a reality-based program with actual social value. Here it is: indie-film TV. In conjunction with HBO, the producers -- Matt Damon and Ben Affleck among them -- have announced plans to pick an aspiring filmmaker and finance his or her project. As the director casts, shoots and edits, an additional camera crew will follow behind and shoot the ready-made ''making of'' documentary. Youths with a bohemian bent will tune in to ''Greenlight'' to learn a lesson that could save their parents millions of dollars in film-school expenses: the life of the auteur is hard. And dull.</p>
        <p>Damon and Affleck have a less educational goal, of course. They want to find a star. And so, their spokesman has said, they'll select the project on the basis not just of the script's strength but also of how well they think the lucky director will play to the camera (the one trained on the one he or she is behind). You can expect the indie-film community to seethe with resentment, to say the winner is more good-looking than talented. And you can probably expect them to be right.</p>
        <p>But that's the way the world works. What sells an artistic product isn't the quality of the artwork; it's the presentability of the artist. Damon and Affleck are just applying the well-learned lessons of the past few decades. Good looks have always been required for acting, but by the 1980's, after what had been a banner decade for grungy, unkempt stadium rockers, MTV imposed the same standards on the music industry. The muscled diaphragm of a teenage pop idol quickly became more important than the voice it projected. Remember Martha Wash, the plus-size singer who filed suit when C+C Music Factory hired a skinny model to lip-sync her tracks on the ''Everybody Dance Now'' video?</p>
        <p>What makes the current situation seem mildly appalling is that it's so commonplace no one even questions it anymore. And it involves media in which the effacement of the artist was once considered not only a practical reality but also a virtue. Cecily Brown, Justine Kurland and Stella Schnabel make themselves the talk of an approving New York art scene by baring their breasts, thighs or midriffs in the pages of glossy fashion magazines. Twenty eminent members of the cultural elite -- from Salman Rushdie (post-cosmetic surgery) to Tom Ford -- pose solemnly next to their favorite Absolut ads for an advertisement about advertisements that you can find on newsstands now. VH1 just broadcast ''Out of Sync,'' a movie adaptation of Wash's case. (''They used her voice . . . to make her a star.'') It starred two equally aerobicized women.</p>
        <p>Writers, too, play the game. Any author with a potentially commercial manuscript gets called in for a round of go-see visits with interested editors, who want not only to discuss the book but also to decide whether the author has the looks to go on ''Good Morning America'' or be featured in Allure. The New Yorker has started publishing a full-page glamour shot of every short-story writer making a debut in its pages. It has got to the point where those who choose not to play along -- authors who refuse to put their photos on their book jackets or bands, like Pearl Jam, who no doubt try their publicists by declining to participate in fashion shoots or music videos -- stand out as genuine oddities.</p>
        <p>The commodification of artists and writers may be off-putting, but it's neither new nor all that deplorable. Artists have always had to market themselves, whether to noblemen at a Renaissance court or to officers at a nonprofit foundation. You might even see the romantic image of the artist, that carefully packaged creature of rapture and torment, as a clever bit of branding aimed at an emergent middle class. Suddenly art wasn't just words or pictures or craft. It was an attitude, a neighborhood, a swashbuckling personal style.</p>
        <p>What's particular today is the emphasis on looks. The image -- the face, the body, compressed into two dimensions -- has become a lapidary bit of shorthand. It says everything that needs to be said in the time allotted. It's infinitely reproducible and ever-easier to send. But its vocabulary is limited. There are thousands of kinds of artistic cool that the camera can't communicate in the necessary instant. It's sad to think of all these rich and complicated phenomena being flattened, almost literally, onto a page or a screen.</p>
        <p>But I wouldn't worry too much. Art is always viewed through the filters of its time. Greatness slips through anyway -- and sometimes where you least expect it, dressed in the gawdy costume of commercial culture. The irony is that the images of the artist that have for now eclipsed the art are the most impermanent element of the creative process. They are a necessary first step, but after that, they are fodder for the recycling pile. If the book is good, the author's photo will someday be replaced by a quotation that has become a part of the culture; if the movie endures, even the E! interviews will someday all be forgotten.</p>
