        <p>Cessna Aircraft Company and the Harrison-based TAG Aviation U.S.A. have formed a new company to serve the expanding ''fractional ownership market,'' whereby businesses acquire a share of an airplane rather than buying full ownership.</p>
        <p>Cessna is acquiring a 50 percent interest in TAG StarShares Holding to form CitationShares Holding, which will continue to be based at the Westchester County Airport and to market Cessna's Citation jet aircraft.</p>
