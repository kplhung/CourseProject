        <p>IT seems a little too 60's now, with those strange insets and pretentious split screens, but they're only in a few scenes. What makes Ralph Nelson's CHARLY (1968) a must-see-again is the remarkable (Oscar-winning) performance by Cliff Robertson. The story, from Daniel Keyes's ''Flowers for Algernon,'' is about a gentle mentally retarded man who becomes a genius through experimental surgery, then learns that it's all too good to be true. It's not Mr. Robertson's protrayal of Charly's early limitations that's impressive; it's the evolution of the character into all kinds of awareness, conveyed with subtleties that most actors can only read about. Claire Bloom is lovely as the teacher who guides him through the changes and becomes more involved than she'd intended - Sunday at 2 p.m. on A&amp;E.</p>

        <p>IT seems a little too 60's now, with those strange insets and pretentious split screens, but they're only in a few scenes. What makes Ralph Nelson's CHARLY (1968) a must-see-again is the remarkable (Oscar-winning) performance by Cliff Robertson. The story, from Daniel Keyes's ''Flowers for Algernon,'' is about a gentle mentally retarded man who becomes a genius through experimental surgery, then learns that it's all too good to be true. It's not Mr. Robertson's protrayal of Charly's early limitations that's impressive; it's the evolution of the character into all kinds of awareness, conveyed with subtleties that most actors can only read about. Claire Bloom is lovely as the teacher who guides him through the changes and becomes more involved than she'd intended - Sunday at 2 p.m. on A&amp;E.</p>
        <p>If one handsome man was ever born to play a particular movie role, it's Denzel Washington as Walter Mosley's upright detective Easy Rawlins. And he does it with devastating style in Carl Franklin's DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS (1995). It's 1948 Los Angeles, and Easy - just an unemployed black machinist with a mortgage to pay - is on his first case. He's searching for a white woman with a taste for black night life who is involved with a rich mayoral candidate. But the plot and the dead bodies are incidental. The attractions here are the perfor-mances, the milieu and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography, proving that film noir looks great in black. The other standout is Don Cheadle as Mouse, Easy's loose-cannon friend who just loves to point guns - Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channel 4.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline Bisset and Candice Bergen suffered some unflattering reviews as old college friends who become writers of very different sytles and financial means in ''Rich and Famous'' (1981). Mostly they were compared unfavor-ably with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, who starred in the original, OLD ACQUAINTANCE (1943). Some critics weren't crazy about that film either (the New York Times review called it tedious), but it's highly entertaining. Gig Young, at age 30, is the younger man who comes into Davis's life. And everybody's favorite scene is the one in which Davis tries to shake some sense into Hopkins (literally) - Monday at 9:30 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>Speaking of longtime friends who get physical about old resentments, Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft have a funny Lincoln Center fight scene in THE TURNING POINT (1977). Audiences didn't see Ms. MacLaine get this worked up again until her give-my-daughter-her-medication speech in ''Terms of Endearment.'' Ms. Bancroft is the prima ballerina reaching the end of her career. Ms. MacLaine is the former dancer who gave it all up for husband and children in Oklahoma City. Leslie Browne is Ms. MacLaine's daughter, a dewy novice ballerina whose love both women covet. The film, directed by Herber Ross, gets a little too soapy, but it's articulate and there's some lovely dancing. Mikhail Baryshnikov made his acting debut as Ms. Browne's womanizing love interest - Wednesday at 10 p.m. and Wednesday/Early Thursday at 4 a.m. on AMC.</p>
        <p>Movies have never made old age look particularly appealing, and Ron Howard's exuberant fantasy cocoon (1985) is no exception. But the general misery of agroup of elderly Floridians - including Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Don Ameche, Jack Gilford, Wilford Brimleya nd Gwen Verdon - is just the setup for their energetic joy youth. Space aliens are involved. Ameche won the best supporting actor Oscar, partly because of his break-dancing - Saturday at 8 p.m. on Channel 9.</p>
