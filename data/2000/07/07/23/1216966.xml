        <p>TOM FALUS said he was feeling a lot like Chuck Yeager these days. Just like the first man to break the sound barrier in aviation, Mr. Falus is trying to push the envelope of real estate transactions by helping develop a system for doing the often-complex deals over the Internet.</p>
        <p>His company, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, one of the largest commercial real estate brokerages in the country, recently signed a contract with Zethus Inc. to conduct leasing transactions online starting next year. Zethus, which is based in Houston, is backed by the Goldman Sachs Group, the Wall Street investment banking firm, which has  extensive links to real estate. Zethus officials have said the system will require an investment of $40 million to $50 million before its launch.</p>

        <p>TOM FALUS said he was feeling a lot like Chuck Yeager these days. Just like the first man to break the sound barrier in aviation, Mr. Falus is trying to push the envelope of real estate transactions by helping develop a system for doing the often-complex deals over the Internet.</p>
        <p>His company, Cushman &amp; Wakefield, one of the largest commercial real estate brokerages in the country, recently signed a contract with Zethus Inc. to conduct leasing transactions online starting next year. Zethus, which is based in Houston, is backed by the Goldman Sachs Group, the Wall Street investment banking firm, which has  extensive links to real estate. Zethus officials have said the system will require an investment of $40 million to $50 million before its launch.</p>
        <p>Although Zethus is one of hundreds of companies trying to adapt Internet technology to the real estate market (a recent report by Credit Suisse First Boston listed 214), Mr. Falus said he thought it had the best chance of developing a Nasdaq-like market for leasing transactions.</p>
        <p>''We are following a long-term business strategy,'' said Mr. Falus, who is president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield's new ventures group. ''We think we have partnered with the best and the brightest in the business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Falus acknowledged that in order to trade real estate like stocks or bonds, standards would have to be developed so that terms and descriptions of available space in different locations would be comparable. ''All parties can agree that a foot is 12 inches, rent is rent, and so forth'' he said. He noted that real estate debt documentation had been standardized sufficiently to permit the development of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market.</p>
        <p>Describing how such a system would work, Mr. Faulus said: ''We could put a request for proposals out on the Internet to landlords who have space available. We could say that Cushman &amp; Wakefield represents a Standard &amp; Poors AA rated tenant in the financial services field that needs X thousand square feet in these locations on a 10-year lease. The bidding closes at 12 p.m. next Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees that it will be possible to simplify lease transactions so they can trade like commodities. One doubter is Julien J. Studley, chairman of the company bearing his name and the dean of tenant brokers. He said there were too many twists and turns in large commercial leases to trade office space like winter wheat.</p>
        <p>''You have to decide what it is you are buying,'' he said. One example, he said, is  the details attached to landlord allowances for interior construction. ''If he gives you a certain amount of money, the question is, how can you spend it? Do you have to use his contractor? If you are free to use any contractor, do you have to give back 20 percent? And how do you know that, after five years, the guy next door has the right to take your space?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Studley said automated markets were most likely to develop for very small spaces, where tenants have trouble attracting the attention of brokers and value the speed of moving into a location over the nuances of the lease.</p>
        <p>Andrew L. Farkas, the chairman of Insignia Financial Group, which owns and manages commercial and residential properties and supplies brokerage and other services, agreed that an automated market might  develop for smaller spaces, which he defined as ''15,000 square feet and south.''</p>
        <p>But he said that, for the most part, ''the Internet will not close transactions; people will close transactions over the Internet.'' Nevertheless, he said, the perceived role of the broker may change, and the commission structure may change to reflect services,  such as tax analysis, other than matching up buyers and sellers.</p>
        <p>''The value proposition has been seen as the place where supply meets demand,'' he said. ''In fact that is the least important aspect of sophisticated brokerage services.''</p>
        <p>James A. Hime, the chief executive of Zethus (the name comes from a demigod in Greek mythology), said the system would be open to all parties in commercial transactions and would be marketed to the real estate officials of larger corporations. ''These companies have hundreds and thousands of leases and corporate real estate officers are beset by all this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The system, he said, would be programmed to notify these officials of lease expirations well in advance of the need to make a decision, and present them with alternative locations in the market. Although the system will be capable of handling transactions directly between a landlord and tenant without a broker, he said,  the expectation is that such deals will be uncommon.</p>
        <p>''After much thought and discussion with corporate real estate officers, we were persuaded that, while the technology would permit principal-to-principal transactions, they will be the exception rather than the rule,'' Mr. Hime said. ''Even with the best data base, only someone who is in the market every day really understands it.''</p>
        <p>He said real estate professionals were  like lawyers and investment bankers, whose skills in making a legal argument or structuring a deal are as important as filing a suit or selling securities. ''Brains are still valuable,'' he said. ''The place for the expert is secure for the future, even as new technology makes them more efficient.''</p>
        <p>He said he expected some resistance to on-line transactions by brokers accustomed to conventional approaches. But he likens it to the way lawyers at his old firm of Baker &amp; Botts reacted to the installation of Lexus terminals giving access to legal data. ''At first they were seen as a back-up to the books in the law library,'' he said. ''Five years later it was reversed. I consulted the Lexus terminal while I was on the telephone with clients.''</p>
        <p>The changing value of information and expertise led Cushman &amp; Wakefield earlier this year to sell its nationwide database on properties, rental rates and vacancies to a company formerly known as RELocate,  now doing business as RealtyIQ.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. Falus said the sale was a recognition that the value of gathering and storing information had diminished at a time when information will be widely available commercially on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Cushman &amp; Wakefield wants to be positioned at the highest value-added points in the real estate business,'' he said. ''In the past we gathered and disseminated information. Once we realized that there were going to be companies specializing in information, we decided we did not have to do it ourselves. There are better uses for our financial capital and our human capital.''</p>
        <p>HE said this thinking was also behind the linkup with Goldman Sachs and Zethus. ''We are consumers of technology, but we are not a technology company. We have capital, but as a private company we have to use it sparingly.''</p>
        <p>The search for an alliance with an entity that knew about technology and had access to capital inevitably led to Wall Street, Mr. Falus said. The search for one that also knew about real estate and transactions led to Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>Other Internet-dependent services due to hit the market shortly are not as far-reaching as the Zethus plan. Mr. Farkas said Insignia, which launched EdificeRex, a portal of Internet services, for its residential tenants in February, would start rolling out  RexOffice for its commercial properties  next month. He said the service would offer e-mail, instant messaging, calendars, community announcements and concierge functions, like reserving tickets to events.</p>
        <p>He said tenants too small to set up their own intranets for employees could have  what appeared to be their own Web pages. ''The Widget Company's Web page will look like it is owned by the Widget Company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Community buying services will also be  possible, he said. As an example, he gave  tenants in a building who buy bottled water from multiple vendors, each with it own delivery schedule.</p>
        <p>''Say you have 70 tenants in a building, each buying 50 to 70 gallons a month,'' he said. ''The system would accumulate all those order and put out a request for proposals and buy all the water from one vendor and one delivery. That is a more efficient way to do things.''</p>
