        <p>It wasn't so long ago when Toshi Reagon was just another folkie with a great pedigree (her mother, Bernice Johnson, is a social activist and singer with Sweet Honey in the Rock). But thanks to her breakout 1999 recording ''Righteous Ones,'' a genre-bending beauty, she has become the Next Big Thing. Along with her first-rate band, Big Lovely, Ms. Reagon has generated much excitement among fans and critics who consider her one of the most compelling performers on the modern-rock scene.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reagon possesses a robust, unaffected voice, sometimes reminiscent of Sheryl Crow, and a confident deftness on guitar. Her musical background -- folk, blues and spirituals -- gives her a unique launching pad for her rock 'n' roll sentiments. After all, she was a teenager who loved Kiss and Black Sabbath. Her themes effortlessly shift from the autobiographical to the downright political, and the musical styles flash by (work-gang chants, Motown pop, thrashing rock and roll) and combine in a wink of an eye, creating a musical hybrid that fits perfectly with the innovation-hungry modern-rock, alternative crowd. On Friday night at Maxwell's in Hoboken, if she performs the riveting ''There Are'' and the torpid funky blues ''Sweet in the Morning,'' you've gotten your money's worth.</p>
