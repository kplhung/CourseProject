        <p>SOMETIMES, in a busy life, the need to make art wells up unexpectedly and turns life around. There is no way to predict the onset of this condition, nor is there any known cure. It can strike anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p>In an attic in Newark, Robert Bonanno bathed the tips of Crayolas in the low flame from a propane torch. Patiently, he guided the melting wax, bead by dripping bead, onto a square of thin plywood, creating oddly shaped puddles of pure color in a mazelike design. ''I'm 42 and still playing with crayons,'' he cheerfully admitted.</p>
        <p>In a cellar in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Robert Parker meticulously shaped champagne cork wire, matchsticks, old fuses, coins and bits of plastic and metal into tiny, glittering chairs. He built mysterious wooden boxes, too. ''Do You See Your Own Shadow When You Dream?'' asked one. Inside were more little objects: a chess knight, a leprechaun, stamps, an ear of corn. ''In a dream an ear of corn could dance,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>In a garage in Oceanside, N.Y., Paul Livert bolted tag-sale finds -- chandelier parts, candlestick holders, used hardware, oil burner nozzles -- onto bowling balls, turning them into striking pop-eyed creatures. His work space was cluttered with enough old balls to start a league -- and with heaps of future body parts. ''If you run out of potential eyes,'' he said gravely, ''you're dead.''</p>
        <p>In a house in New Haven, Winfred Rembert tooled into leather the stories of his life: his near-lynching; his stint on a chain gang; the characters of his Georgia youth -- Papa Screwball, Raincoat Red, Bubba Duke and the rest. He had so many memories, Mr. Rembert fretted, and not enough time. ''I'll probably be dead and in my grave before all this stuff is done,'' he said. ''I'll never get it done.''</p>
        <p>Four individualists with one unforeseen, life-changing compulsion: to declare themselves through art. And so they have, without formal training and with apparent success. ''What is art?'' is a question that is endlessly argued, but all four have been invited to exhibit in galleries, and some of Mr. Livert's bowling balls have even been displayed in a world-class art museum -- though in the restrooms.</p>
        <p>Being self-taught artists has not hurt the four, either. Art may disdain labels, but in marketing, labels matter, and ''self-taught'' beckons dealers, collectors and the media with the prospect of fresh and possibly eccentric talent. So desirable is the adjective that some artists with extensive formal training insist that they taught themselves. Others scoff at the tag, however, contending that cultural influences are inescapable and that no artist is truly self-taught. Indeed, a few of Mr. Parker's creations incorporate the visitor's buttons he collected on his many museum jaunts, and what he saw there inspired later works. (For the record, he calls himself a self-taught surrealist.)</p>
        <p>For their part, Mr. Livert and Mr. Bonanno have been told that they belonged in the category of outsider artist. ''What is it -- it's really homespun stuff, or what?'' Mr. Bonanno asked. Mr. Livert said he was thrilled to be called an artist, period.</p>
        <p>''Self-taught,'' ''outsider,'' ''visionary,'' ''folk'' -- these terms are often used interchangeably. ''There are no rigid definitions,'' said Joseph Jacobs, the curator of American art at the Newark Museum. ''It's a mess.'' Still, purists valiantly draw distinctions among the terms.</p>
        <p>''Outsider'' used to refer to self-taught artists who lived apart from society or in worlds of their own -- like hermits, psychic mediums and the insane -- and who created art obsessively without realizing, or caring, that it was art. Now ''outsider'' is sometimes casually applied to any self-taught artist working off the radar of the mainstream art world. ''It just got all garbled up in its application in America,'' said Lee Kogan, the director of the Folk Art Institute at the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan and a proponent of ''self-taught.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca Hoffberger, the founder and director of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, said ''visionary'' sidestepped the hair-splitting discussions about in-ness and out-ness that ''outsider'' provoked. ''I have to listen to all these academicians,'' Ms. Hoffberger said, ''who go: 'Oooh, is it outsider or is it insider?' 'Oooh, are they outside the mainstream or have they been corrupted now because they went to a museum and saw something else?' And it's a very boring discussion.''</p>
        <p>As for ''folk,'' a common-sense interpretation of the term would be art made by regular, well, folk. But Ms. Hoffberger said folk art arises out of an established tradition, while visionary art is one person's heartfelt cry to the world. ''Usually they've just had a life experience, which is just so overwhelming, through joy or through pain, that there are no words for it, and it just starts coming out as art,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The label ''self-taught'' does not imply emotional turmoil; Mr. Bonanno, for one, says his crayon art is ''just examples of techniques.'' But for him and other self-taught artists in the region, Ms. Hoffberger's words about the visionary are apt: ''They have the conviction of their own taste. They haven't been poured through a filter of rules. So they come from a foundation of openness to possibility.''</p>
        <p>Vision and Compassion</p>
        <p>One day around 1970, when her first two sons were small, Mary Whitfield went into her garage in West Hempstead, N.Y., found some plywood and house paints and painted a mother with a patch in her apron and a little girl ''with one big tear flowing down her eye.'' Where the image came from she did not know.</p>
        <p>For a few years she painted, until everyday life -- including another son, job training and work -- pushed art aside. Suddenly, one night around 1990, she challenged herself to try again. When her new efforts received praise, she said, she ''went on a frenzy, just painting, painting, painting'' all the visions that flooded her mind.</p>
        <p>The result: gentle watercolors of everyday life in slave cabins and cotton fields and somber, sorrowful ones of lynchings -- lifeless black bodies hanging from trees, grieving loved ones below. ''Instead of hate, I'm trying to convey compassion,'' Ms. Whitfield said. ''God allowed this to happen, and that is why I hold no hatred in my heart.''</p>
        <p>In 1996 Ms. Whitfield received a grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation and in 1997 a residency at the MacDowell artists' colony in New Hampshire. She was included in three exhibitions at the American Visionary Art Museum. She is under contract for a children's book. This summer, three of her paintings were hung at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery in Manhattan. Oprah Winfrey owns two Whitfields.</p>
        <p>Yet life for Ms. Whitfield is a daily struggle. The slight, soft-spoken woman depends on a benefactress to pay the rent on her Port Washington apartment, where she paints on the bed. At the end of June she didn't have enough money on hand to attend the opening of her work in Manhattan. ''I kind of cried a little to myself,'' she said, ''but I got over it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whitfield was born in 1947, in the basement of a hospital for whites only in Birmingham, Ala. ''God took somebody's heart, a nurse, a doctor, or whoever,'' she said, to let her mother in. After she was born, her parents married, but her father walked out after the ceremony, and she never met him, Ms. Whitfield said.</p>
        <p>As a child, she seesawed between her strong-willed grandmother in Alabama and her mother, who moved to Long Island and worked as a domestic. Her grandmother forced her to attend civil rights gatherings, and she went reluctantly, she said, both disinterested and fearful of possible violence. Only now, she said, is she learning facts about black history.</p>
        <p>Her beloved brother Gregory died in 1994, her mother in 1995 and her only sister, Albessie, in 1997, she said, plainly still grieving. She married in 1965, but the union was often troubled, and for the last few years she and her husband have lived apart, Ms. Whitfield said. Her three grown sons, all college educated, are pursuing careers in New York, New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
        <p>Her own career, she said, is in God's hands. ''It's been trying, it's been hard,'' she said. ''And now I feel it's Mommy's time. And I hope I can make it as one of the black artists in this world.</p>
        <p>''I ask God for that.''</p>
        <p>Paterson's Past in Metal</p>
        <p>His father's father was a gandy dancer, laying track for railroad trains; his mother's father was a civil engineer. In Joe Ruffilo the two natures merged, for the Paterson man is a self-taught sculptor with an affinity for steel, an eye for form and the urge to build.</p>
        <p>''He carves steel like it's soapstone,'' said Giacomo De Stefano, the director of the Paterson Museum, where some of Mr. Ruffilo's work is on display until Labor Day. Combining new metal with old, like railroad cleats, gutter hooks and the remains of industrial machines, Mr. Ruffilo creates pieces with a surprising airiness, Mr. De Stefano said.</p>
        <p>To prepare for the museum show, one Saturday afternoon in May Mr. Ruffilo, 58, headed to Prototype Support, a machine shop in Paterson whose owner, Robert Valente, has become the artist's technical right hand.</p>
        <p>The two men set up a piece that Mr. Ruffilo had designed the night before. Using a wire-fed welder, Mr. Valente tacked where Mr. Ruffilo pointed, and suggested additional welds for strength. Twenty minutes later, Mr. Ruffilo eyed the small abstract sculpture happily, then briskly pushed it aside.  ''One piece of art,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>After 90 minutes, he surveyed two more: ''Seahorse at the Mardi Gras,'' which evoked a fantastic float, and a more menacing construction that reminded him, he said, of a Leonardo da Vinci war machine.</p>
        <p>''Today was really a great day,'' he said. ''When you do a decent job, it gives your life a little meaning.''</p>
        <p>Paterson-born and raised and proudly blue-collar, Mr. Ruffilo dropped out of high school and worked at jobs ranging from truck driver to quality-control inspector to groundskeeper to printer. Retired since 1997, he has two adult children from an early marriage, and two teenage boys with Mary, his wife for the past quarter-century.</p>
        <p>He likes to give his art, which also includes paintings and prints, to friends; over 30-odd years, he said, he's probably made less than $10,000 from it. ''He does art because it's within him, and he needs to get it out,'' Mr. De Stefano said.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for his sculpture, Mr. Ruffilo said, could be found along the train tracks and in the junkyards where he once played, in the clattering factories of Paterson's industrial past, and in the men and women who labored there. ''What I do is kind of a tribute to all this stuff,'' he said, ''all the engineers, all the people that worked on the looms in the factory, all the sign painters, the welders.'' His voice thickened. ''All of them.''</p>
        <p>A Life Sketched in Leather</p>
        <p>In a prison about 30 years ago, Winfred Rembert Sr. learned how to score pretty designs into leather pocketbooks and billfolds. But as for tooling and dyeing large leather canvases into storytelling works of art -- no one taught him that.</p>
        <p>His wife, Patsy, raised the idea, Mr. Rembert said. ''She said: 'You should do some pictures. You got a history that people want to know about.' '' He wasn't so sure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert has always trusted his ability, explained Philip McBlain, a friend and rare-book dealer, ''but I don't think he's ever really had confidence that white folks or society at large would value what he could do.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Rembert put aside his doubts. Working deep into the night in the small front room of his New Haven home, he sketched a design on paper, redrew it on much bigger paper, traced it onto wet leather donated by supportive friends, cut every line up to five separate times with different tools, and mixed and applied the dyes. Each canvas took at least three weeks, he said.</p>
        <p>Steadily, he preserved his memories, from his Great Aunt Lillian, a field worker who raised him because his mother couldn't, to the town characters of Cuthbert, Ga., where he grew up, to the cotton fields where he saw a woman give birth. And he discovered that some people would value what he could do.</p>
        <p>Beginning Aug. 22, the Yale University Art Gallery will showcase his work. ''I think he's a real talent,'' said Jock Reynolds, the director of the gallery, who said he had seen Mr. Rembert's art on display at McBlain Books in Hamden, Conn., and admired it so much he went back for a second look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert, 54, said he had lost too much schooling to crop work and had dropped out in the 10th grade. In 1967, he stole a car, fought with a police officer, grabbed his gun and fled. Caught, he was almost lynched, he said. He spent seven years in prison. Afterward, he married Patsy and moved North.</p>
        <p>With jobs as a longshoreman and heavy equipment operator, Mr. Rembert supported a family that grew to eight children. But health problems sidelined him, and later he couldn't find work. In the 80's he briefly turned to drug dealing and served six months at a federal penitentiary, Mr. Rembert said. From sad knowledge he taught his children that drugs were dead ends.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Winfred Rembert Jr., then 16, refused to sell drugs for a local gang and  was shot protecting a younger brother from gang members. The incident made national news. ''He's the reason that his kids wouldn't participate,'' Mrs. Rembert said of her husband. ''I think he's a wonderful human being, to have gone through the things that he's gone through.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert said turmoil was a constant in his life. ''I've been running all of my life, just running and running,'' he said. ''I'm hoping someday my art will be successful enough for me to stop running.''</p>
        <p>Rolling With Bowling Balls</p>
        <p>At 5, Paul Livert performed a drum-and-tap-dance routine in theaters that were so fourth-rate, the vaudevillians stuck in them sneeringly called them ''toilets.''</p>
        <p>At a robust 79, Mr. Livert was back in the toilets again, and thrilled to be there.</p>
        <p>Some years ago a museum curator on Long Island termed Mr. Livert an outsider artist. The Brooklyn-born former record promoter, who said he helped advance the careers of the Rolling Stones, Mantovani and Tom Jones, seized on the hook. When his younger son told him about the American Visionary Art Museum opening in Baltimore in 1995, he began to badger Ms. Hoffberger, the museum's founder and director, about his bowling ball art, or ''scrapture.'' Late last year, 30-odd pieces of scrapture finally headed to Baltimore, where they were destined to beautify two rooms in the basement: the men's and the ladies'.</p>
        <p>''From toilet to toilet over a period of 75 years,'' Mr. Livert said with a chuckle. ''You couldn't make that up if you tried.'' Since the museum was ''top of the line for outsider art,'' he said, he had no objections to his unorthodox placement: ''As long as I was within the confines of that museum, I made it!'' (His pieces were later moved to the gift shop; more than a dozen have been sold, he said.)</p>
        <p>Why bowling balls? When his family moved to Oceanside more than 40 years ago, Mr. Livert explained, a cousin who was a pin boy at a bowling alley started donating old scarred balls for use as lawn decor. When Mr. Livert's employment tapered off about 12 years ago, those balls caught his fancy. He painted and decorated them, first with plastic caps, later with brass, and ''it just grew,'' he said. Soon he was spending five to six hours a day on his art -- and not just bowling balls: teakettles, copper pots and other gleaming discards got faces, too. For the last few years, though, he devoted most of his time to caring for Cleo, his wife, who died of cancer last October.</p>
        <p>Asked what he was trying to say through his art, Mr. Livert snorted. If not for tenacity, Mr. Livert said, ''I would not have gotten this far. It's not because my work has a message or I have a vision. There's no message.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Livert's bright blue eyes do have vision. They can look at part of a dismantled chandelier and see hair blowing in the wind.</p>
        <p>Dripping Bursts of Color</p>
        <p>From a distance, the large red triangle on Robert Bonanno's living room wall resembled a wedge of pizza smothered in sauce. Up close, the marinara became thousands of little pillars of red crayon wax, glistening like stalagmites and formed in the same way, drop by drop. Mr. Bonanno titled the piece ''My Bleeding Heart.'' A subterranean cry of pain from the curly haired, genial Mr. Bonanno? ''Nah,'' he shrugged. ''It's just a name.''</p>
        <p>As a ''meltist'' (his word), technique dominates, said Mr. Bonanno, a carpenter by day who is married with two sons. He developed his technique through trial and error: dripping, which he used to create the heart and some small statues; layering, or adding puddles on top of puddles; streaking, which lets him fling drops of hot wax about; and circling and staining, which create overlapping bursts of color, like a kaleidoscope before the pattern settles.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Nutley, he started melting crayons as a lark at 15 and found that Crayolas worked best. Five of his pieces are on display at the Crayola factory in Easton, Pa., one of Mr. Bonanno's favorite places.</p>
        <p>He also likes galleries and watching the people there regress as they view his work. ''It's like they just totally lose it, they go back to being a kid,'' he said. '' 'Go ahead, smell it,' I say. So you see them all dressed up and sniffing.'' The sniffers then share stories about the fun they had as children, melting crayons on heaters and hot cars, making a glorious mess. ''Everybody can relate to crayons,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His fragile artwork has cracked in extreme cold and threatened to run when displayed under glass in bright sun. In 1992, fire struck the basement of his Newark home, the heat reached the living room and most of his meltings melted. Mr. Bonanno said he felt compelled to re-create every lost piece -- ''just like an insect, building its little house again.'' His attachment is so strong that he's not eager to sell. ''They take so long to make, I try to hold on to them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Putting down his propane torch to pose for a snapshot, he held his latest piece at an angle to display its candy-colored layers. The picture taken, he impulsively touched his art to his cheek, then smiled fondly. ''It's still warm,'' he murmured.</p>
        <p>Miniatures and Boxes With Locks</p>
        <p>When he starts feeling introverted, Robert Parker said, his art gets smaller and smaller. Case in point: his diminutive chairs, which represent ''the companionship of solitude.''</p>
        <p>Is the reverse also true? If so, Mr. Parker must be poised to turn extrovert, because that tiny, dancing ear of corn is history. Now, he said, he wants to make giant vegetables.</p>
        <p>Commuters can become too complacent, he said. ''What if you drove by one day and there was a six-foot carrot where there hadn't been one the day before?'' he said. ''And you drive by the next day, the carrot's gone, but up the road's a tomato?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, 49, obviously enjoys the tweak. Some of his decorated boxes display prominent locks suggesting that something precious or startling is cached within. ''People say, 'Can I look inside?' '' he said. ''I say, 'Well, do you dare?' '' Those who do dare find -- nothing. ''That's sort of the chance you take,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, one of his unlocked boxes, ''Luck,'' is adorned with coins to entice peeks. Inside, as promised, is a lucky piece -- but a barrier of nails keeps eager hands away. ''You can't get luck,'' Mr. Parker said. He said he'd like to put a cat skull in a box to illustrate what curiosity can do.</p>
        <p>An artist friend once used Mr. Parker's noble profile and silver-gray beard as the model for a portrait of Rip Van Winkle. The youngest of 10 children, Mr. Parker grew up in Harrisville, N.H. After high school came unsatisfying labor at textile mills before he landed his dream job: managing a tree farm. Living in the woods without electricity or a telephone, he picked up a knife one day and started to carve.</p>
        <p>In 1979 Mr. Parker and his wife and baby daughter -- a son came later -- moved to Westchester County, where his wife's family owned an art supply store. He became vice president of the store, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and stayed until 1999, then left for a less stressful job. Over the years, meanwhile, his work with wood evolved into art. He said he wanted people to see ordinary objects in a new light, so he built jointed wooden figures, three feet tall, and covered them with prosaic things like bottle caps. On one figure, a doorbell became a belly button, and a split tennis ball became -- what else? -- tennis elbow. He designed wild masks out of shiny pieces of this and that. He started showing work in galleries. He'd come a long way from whittling spoons.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get up one day when I was a kid and say, 'When I grow up, I'm going to be an artist,' '' Mr. Parker said. ''You come to it. You go through life, and you start to view the world from a different angle.''</p>
        <p>Expressing Personal Vision</p>
        <p>The creations on display at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore are by turns haunting, funny, beautiful, inexplicable and bizarre. Reactions to them can vary widely. Confronted with so much effusive strangeness, visitors may feel like outsiders themselves, unable to connect with the artists and their visions. Or they may feel inspired to pick up a brush, scrounge for broken glass, or buy a crate of toothpicks and a case of Elmer's.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Hoffberger described this burst of enthusiasm: '' 'Oh, my God, look at all these people who never thought they were artists and now they're artists. I can be an artist, too!' ''</p>
        <p>But the museum seeks to induce a subtler epiphany, Ms. Hoffberger said. After all, personal vision and fresh thought can be expressed in more ways than through wall art or sculpture.</p>
        <p>''I would much rather people come out with a sense that they have a voice that is uniquely their own,'' she said. ''And maybe it will manifest in that it will give them more energy to do a garden amazingly. Or to just try to say whatever is in them that needs saying.''</p>
