        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While agreeing completely with David Margolick [''A Song That Reverberates in the American Soul,'' July 2] about the impact, importance and resonance of the very singular ballad ''Strange Fruit,'' especially as sung by Billie Holiday, I must take exception to his sweeping claim that ''few songs stir souls or give goose bumps, at least for very long,'' unless they are ''explicitly political'' or ''seem to capture the spirit of an age'' (and hence are implicitly political). Such a judgment seriously underestimates the power of song, and particularly the contribution of the musical element therein. Song does not need socio-political content in order to stir the soul, goose bump the skin or chill the spine. Witness Schubert's ''Erlkonig'' (children's vulnerability), Schumann's ''Mondnacht'' (ecstatic pantheism), Rodgers and Hart's ''My Funny Valentine'' (realistic love), Bob Dylan's ''Visions of Johanna'' (absence and loss), the Beatles' ''She's Leaving Home'' (maturation and separation) or the admittedly melodramatic ''Vesti la giubba'' from ''I Pagliacci.'' Mr. Margolick's short-sightedness is symptomatic of a tendency of many cultural commentators to valorize public and social concerns over personal and domestic ones.</p>
