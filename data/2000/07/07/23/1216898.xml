        <p>To the Editor: I enjoyed reading about Jerry Haines's experiences with commuter planes in ''That Flying Sensation'' (June 25). I was reminded of a trip from Worcester, Mass., to New York City at least 25 years ago. I was returning to New York from a wedding in Massachusetts and decided to ride with my brother, who had scheduled a commuter flight from Worcester to do some business in New York. We had called ahead to add me to the flight.</p>

We had called ahead to add me to the flight.</p>
        <p>When we arrived, there weren't enough seats on the plane, so someone went into the main building (actually the only building) and got two folding chairs. The chairs were clicked into place at the back of the plane, and we were invited to board. And we flew uneventfully into New York City. I must add, however, that was my last commuter plane ride.</p>
