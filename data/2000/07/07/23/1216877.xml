        <p>LESS than a decade ago Mark Burnett was competing in adventure races, an experience that led to his life plan: he would bring the sport to America, which was having a love affair with the outdoors, sport utility vehicles and extreme sports.</p>
        <p>To American athletes and television audiences, Mr. Burnett, who had no previous experience in television, brought the ''Eco-Challenge Expedition Race,'' a several-hundred-miles-long endurance contest on foot, kayak and horseback in exotic locales that pits teams of four against themselves, each other, the whims of nature, and Mr. Burnett.</p>
        <p>That was only the beginning. Now, as executive producer, he has brought to television the highly rated ''Survivor,'' his jungle-theme soap opera/game show. It is the latest in what he promises will be a stream of adventure-related businesses and programming combining a blend of drama and reality he calls ''dramality.'' But the aspiring media mogul has left rankled rivals and colleagues in his wake, even as they applaud him as a master salesman.</p>
        <p>''You can't make the mistake of ever underestimating Mark Burnett,'' said Mike Sears, a Los Angeles adventure filmmaker who shot the first two ''Eco-Challenges.'' ''He's so tenacious he won't stop until he gets it done.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' is the essence of a favorite Burnett pastime -- filming people, whether strangers or teammates, when thrown into stress-producing situations in the wild. He is fascinated by the group dynamic, observing behaviors as if his film subjects were part of a high school science project.</p>
        <p>Though he has been a paratrooper in the Falkland Islands for the British Army, he has often said he would not survive on his own TV island. ''I like to speak my mind,'' he said. ''Even if it ruffles a few feathers, it's just me, the way I've got to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett does see a bit of himself in his programs. ''It's like social Darwinism -- how you adapt and evolve to fit into a group. Everybody wants to be liked. Even me.''</p>
        <p>He may not be liked by everybody, but he has certainly survived the entertainment world. The 40-year-old British native landed in Los Angeles in 1982 and did not begin his television efforts until the early 1990's. He has since developed two winning entertainment vehicles in remarkably little time by Hollywood standards.</p>
        <p>The only child of working-class parents, Mr. Burnett joined the military at 18 and served in Northern Ireland and the Falklands as a member of the British Army Parachute Regiment. Upon discharge, he mulled over a job as a mercenary, but ended up in Los Angeles, pursuing his real dream: making a lot of money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett moved from au pair work to telemarketing, insurance and credit card sales, and even a stint at a modeling agency. A Tony Robbins motivational seminar convinced him he could design his own life.</p>
        <p>After reading about adventure races in New Zealand and the French Raid Gauloises competition, Mr. Burnett was entranced. He assembled a United States team and did the Raid three times in the early 1990's, finishing once.</p>
        <p>Before he entered his first race, in 1992 in Oman, Mr. Burnett bought with proceeds from his telemarketing business what he thought were the United States rights to the Raid. After a flurry of litigation and a settlement, he was on his way.</p>
        <p>He still needed more money and was introduced to Brian Terkelsen, a young investment banker new to the West Coast and in search of a new venture, preferably entertainment-related. Together they drummed up interest and money for their new company, Eco-Challenge Lifestyles, begun in a Santa Monica, Calif., bedroom. By late 1994 Mr. Burnett was talking to MTV executives about airing his own ''Eco-Challenge'' race. ''Mark had a gut reaction this was going to be a good sporting event,'' said Mr. Terkelsen, whose partnership with Mr. Burnett dissolved in 1998.</p>
        <p>He continued: ''In the first year we had to get 50 teams to pay $10,000 each to come, and they'd never heard of it before. And we did it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett's gut was on the money. Endurance athletes were looking beyond marathons, triathlons and Ironman competitions. The first Raid was in 1989. A full-fledged expedition race was not held in the United States until Mr. Burnett's event in 1995, when 50 four-man teams from six countries mountain-biked, rafted and climbed their way through the red rock country around Moab, Utah. MTV Sports showed that first ''Eco-Challenge.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Byrnes, vice president and creative director of MTV, said he bought the concept because Mr. Terkelsen and Mr. Burnett were ''incredibly good salesmen,'' and because what the racers were doing ''was extreme and crazy and dramatic.''</p>
        <p>The partnership ended after the first program. ''It wasn't the MTV crowd out there doing it,'' Mr. Byrnes said. Racers usually are in their 30's, 40's and even 50's.</p>
        <p>Even critics admit that Mr. Burnett is a persuasive salesman, and he found other television partners. Over the last five years MTV, ESPN and the Discovery Channel have spent a total of $100 million, by his estimate, producing, promoting and airing his ''Eco-Challenge Expedition Race.'' The competitors mountain-bike through jungles, ride camels across deserts, summit glacier-capped peaks, rappel down sheer cliff faces, and kayak through roiling whitewater, while fighting off hunger, panic, fear, anger, exhaustion, cold, wet and heat, all in an average of five to seven days.</p>
        <p>Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS, said Mr. Burnett's dead-on portrayals of human drama and his persuasive personality convinced him he should buy into ''Survivor.''  ''When he talks about something, you really believe he can pull it off,'' Mr. Moonves said.</p>
        <p>In ''Survivor'' and ''Eco-Challenge,'' Mr. Burnett and his production crew set up obstacles when nature doesn't oblige. The emphasis is on the TV production -- how a shot will look and sound on air.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett does not deny this. As for ''Survivor,'' he said, ''It's not reality, it's a relationship show with non-actors and no scripts.'' He also said that adventure racing like ''Eco-Challenge'' is ''totally disparate and undefinable. It's not really a sport.''</p>
        <p>Comments like that irk adventure athletes. But many grudgingly admit that he has brought attention and sponsorship to what they consider a sport. And they line up hundreds deep each year for ''Eco-Challenge,'' even though it means $10,000 in entry fees and thousands more on training, equipment and travel.</p>
        <p>''It just walks over all the other races,'' Ian Adamson, one of the world's top racers and a corporate trainer in Boulder, Colo., said of ''Eco-Challenge.''</p>
        <p>Some say Mr. Burnett is in the sport only for himself.</p>
        <p>''To those who say he's responsible for the growth of adventure racing, I would say that's an ancillary benefit of his goals,'' said Gordon Wright, a racer and spokesman for the Beast of the East World Championship, which has been run as a regional adventure race but, after trying to expand, was recently canceled when it could not attract enough television interest or corporate sponsorship.</p>
        <p>Over four years on the Discovery Channel, the ''Eco-Challenge'' averaged a 1.1 to a 1.6 rating (about one million to two million viewers), said Mike Quattrone, Discovery's executive vice president and general manager. The program appealed to Discovery's core audience of 25- to 54-year-olds and was heavily watched by men, making Discovery happy, he said. Discovery and Mr. Burnett parted amicably, Mr. Quattrone said, and next spring the network will televise the Southern Traverse race, held in New Zealand in November.</p>
        <p>USA Network has agreed to subsidize and televise the ''Eco-Challenge'' for the next three years, starting with this August's race through the Borneo jungles where the CBS survivors met their fate.</p>
        <p>Adventure racing has grown to hundreds of events in the United States, mostly one to three days. It is a perfect made-for-TV event; the slow pace makes for easy filming of dialogue and team crack-ups, and for leavening with eye-grabbing scenery.</p>
        <p>The sport also innately appeals to couch potatoes, said Duncan Smith, a former Navy Seal and adventure racer who runs the San Francisco-based Presidio Adventure Racing School. ''With adventure racing, people who will never do an adventure race will watch every minute of four or six hours of coverage,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The ''Eco-Challenge'' is a potent entertainment mix, said Gordon Beck, senior vice president of sports and production at USA Network.</p>
        <p>''It's not solely who wins the race, it's what are the human interactions, what are the combination of emotions, mental stamina and physical limits that all play together within a team, and team against team,'' Mr. Beck said. ''Those are fascinating elements that draw an audience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett's appeal is not universal. He can be full of egotistical bluster one moment and disarmingly charming the next.</p>
        <p>He has been accused of manipulating courses and teams to enhance the drama, but Bob Shallow, production vice president for Trans World International, the television division of the sports marketing company International Management Group, said that as a producer, ''you want the most compelling character and the most compelling competition because that's going to draw the audience.'' His company produces the Mild Seven Outdoor Quest, held in China and seen on the Outdoor Life Network.</p>
        <p>MR. BURNETT has also been accused of trying to eliminate the competition by scheduling ''Eco-Challenge'' at the same time as other adventure races and by luring the best racers by waiving entry fees.</p>
        <p>Don Mann, founder of Odyssey Adventure Racing in Virginia Beach, Va., and director of the Beast, said ''Eco-Challenge'' killed his race. He credits Mr. Burnett for helping the sport grow, but questions whether racers are served by less competition.</p>
        <p>And, citing several instances in which he said Mr. Burnett either negotiated in bad faith or lied to him, Mr. Mann said Mr. Burnett could not trusted -- allegations Mr. Burnett denied. ''He's like a rattlesnake -- if you're close enough long enough, you're going to get bit,'' Mr. Mann said. Several other race directors and racers made similar remarks, but none would speak for attribution.</p>
        <p>That doesn't seem to scare Mr. Burnett's new Hollywood associates. Jon Landau, a partner in Lightstorm Entertainment and a producer of ''Titanic,'' has been shopping around a feature-length film based on ''Eco-Challenge,'' and said he was enthralled with Mr. Burnett.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett keeps spinning off related businesses, including Eco-Challenge Adventure Travel, which gives weekend warriors the opportunity to paddle in the same outrigger canoes or mountain-bike down the same trails as real racers, and ''Eco-Challenge'' qualifier races.</p>
        <p>A ''Survivor'' paperback -- a Robinson Crusoe-like diary -- will come out a week after the program's conclusion, and ''Survivor II'' will begin filming in the Australian outback in October, with substantially more financial backing, and payments to Mr. Burnett, from CBS.</p>
        <p>It seems Mr. Burnett chose the right design for life. ''He went into business and the business he chose is adventure,'' Mr. Sears said, ''and he definitely is the best in the world at it.''</p>
