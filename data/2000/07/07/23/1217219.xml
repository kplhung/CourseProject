        <p>New York Jets coach Al Groh claims wide receivers are faster than last year's; there is competition at several positions but none more important than replacing Keyshawn Johnson who was traded to Tampa Bay Buccanneers (M)a</p>

        <p>The Jets have competition at several important positions this summer, but Keyshawn Johnson is not playing tight end or free safety. With Johnson still mouthing off about the Jets from his new home in Tampa, Fla., and the free agent Carl Pickens headed elsewhere, the fight for the wide receiver position vacated by Johnson is the most compelling, and most contested, one in camp.</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh has said that this group of wide receivers is faster than last year's, and every receiver made an impressive catch today in the Jets' first scrimmage of the season.</p>
        <p>The rookie Laveranues Coles, a third-round pick, continued to show promise with four catches for 40 yards and a 9-yard touchdown. In a special-teams drill before the 1-hour-45-minute scrimmage began, Coles made a long punt return that finally showed a flash of the speed for which he is known. Coles also caught a 25-yard pass from Vinny Testaverde on a fade down the left sideline early in the scrimmage, and on a third-down play he shed cornerback Del Lee to catch a fade in the left corner of the end zone.</p>
        <p>''Every day has been a progressive day for him,'' Groh said. ''He's in for an awful lot of plays. He's going to be confronted for situations he's probably not really prepared for yet. But he seems to have resiliency to him. He doesn't let it get him down.''</p>
        <p>While Coles is often praised for his breathtaking speed, he was thought to be short of polished skills because his college career was cut short by off-the-field troubles. But his play today indicated the Jets' gamble on him might pay off.</p>
        <p>''I feel if you put me there, eventually I'll try to do some things,'' Coles said. ''I never felt I was raw. I felt I needed to get into the system, learn the system, that way I'll become a better player in that system.''</p>
        <p>Dedric Ward, who has the inside track to start at the spot opposite Wayne Chrebet, had three receptions for 21 yards, and the fifth-round pick Windrell Hayes, who had four catches for 40 yards, made a diving catch in an impromptu overtime session. Running back Curtis Martin said later that many players had been impressed with Hayes's play-making ability. Fred Coleman, who was on the practice squad last season and practiced well on Friday, had three catches for 26 yards today.</p>
        <p>The catch of the day, however, belonged to Yatil Green, who caught a 45-yard pass from Ray Lucas on the dead run along the right sideline.</p>
        <p>Green, the free-agent signee who the Jets hope will provide size to their receiving corps, made little impact during the first week of camp. Groh issued a thinly veiled criticism of him on Friday, saying he needed to get open more. Green did, by blowing past cornerback Otis Smith. Green caught one other pass in the scrimmage and then took a long session of treatment for his creaky knees.</p>
        <p>Groh, though, had a Bill Parcells-like assessment of Green.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully it's a sign of things to come,'' Groh said. ''You've heard one-game wonder. That's a one-play wonder. I'm a lot more pleased that it happened than it didn't. But the story remains to be written.''</p>
        <p>The leading rusher in this scrimmage? Not Martin or Richie Anderson but Vaughn Sanders, the undrafted free agent from Hofstra, who is hoping to win a roster spot. Sanders was handed the ball five straight times on one drive, and finished with 28 yards on 11 rushes, with a long rush of 8 yards. He also caught two passes for 16 yards. Sanders's performance impressed Martin.</p>
        <p>''It reminded me of what Parcells did to me when I was a rookie,'' Martin said. ''In my first scrimmage, he gave me the ball the first eight times. I was so tired I couldn't even hear what he was saying to me when I came to the sidelines. The one thing Parcells was testing was my staying power, my stamina. And Vaughn showed the heart it takes to be a running back and the stamina to be a running back.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH's overall assessment of the scrimmage was that the Jets were ''very ragged in certain circumstances'' but that the pass protection was improved and the intensity level on offense was more consistent than in days past. . . . The defense is typically ahead of the offense at this time of the season, but it was hard to tell on Saturday; the defense was not allowed to tackle in the ''stand-up scrimmage.'' Even so, BRYAN COX was credited with a sack, and the third-string linebacker COURTNEY LEDYARD put the hit of the day on tight end JAKE MORELAND after Moreland caught a pass over the middle from CHAD PENNINGTON. . . . VINNY TESTAVERDE appeared to move around and throw without any lingering effects from his Achilles' tendon injury, completing 10 of 14 passes for 100 yards and a touchdown. RAY LUCAS was 13 of 21 for 112 yards and a touchdown, and Pennington, the rookie, was 11 of 16 for 104 yards and a touchdown. There were no interceptions. . . . Tight end ANTHONY BECHT, who is making a strong push to win the starting job, had three catches for 29 yards, including a 17-yarder over the middle in traffic. . . . JASON WILTZ has a sprained right elbow. The Jets hope he will be ready for their first preseason game, next Saturday.</p>
