        <p>Profile of Tyrone Laws, who sells Mr Softee ice cream from his truck on streets of Manhattan; despite stiff competition from copycat trucks and myriad ice cream outlets, Mister Softee is by far biggest soft serve franchise in New York City, with more than 250 trucks; photos; chart (M)</p>

        <p>WHERE Tyrone Laws is going today, he will not need chimes.

        <p>WHERE Tyrone Laws is going today, he will not need chimes. He will not need Firecrackers or Warheads or many of the individually wrapped treats that make up the average ice cream man's arsenal. He will not swing out his ''Slow Children Crossing'' sign, and he will not patrol suburbia. He might not even see a child today.</p>
        <p>No, Mr. Laws, an urban Mister Softee, is going to Manhattan, where the cones are  soft and the competition is sticky. There's a Carvel, Ben &amp; Jerry's or Haagen-Dazs on nearly every corner, and on every crosswalk there's the risk of a roving copycat: a Mass Softee, a Freezer Fresh, a Kustard King or the generic ''Soft Ice Cream.''</p>
        <p>But Mister Softee is by far the biggest soft serve franchise in the city, with more than 250 trucks serving more than 400,000 gallons of ice cream and 15 million cones a year. The five or six other ice cream operations generally have 20 or fewer trucks. Together, they swarm the city from April to October in search of the working man's $1.50. And somehow Mr. Laws must scoop out his share. A softie he is not.</p>
        <p>''If I didn't know I was good, I wouldn't do it,'' Mr. Laws said recently. ''Some people are just born for certain jobs.''</p>
        <p>His day begins in a dim depot that smells of soap and oil. There beside the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx sits one of the city's three Mister Softee garages.</p>
        <p>The other morning, Mr. Laws wove through the rows of trucks with a cart of ice cream mix and milk. He is 30, with a boxer's build, a trimmed goatee and a wide smile. He walks with a small swagger. He is a salesman. (In the off-season, he sells unfinished furniture.)</p>
        <p>He started serving ice cream at the age of 8, when he took an after-school job with a Mister Softee man. The boy was just trying to stay out of trouble but found a profession instead. ''The way I do business is how I was taught to do business: clean and respectful,'' Mr. Laws said. ''Because no matter what you do, your business is yours. Coming from the projects, owning your business was a way out. It was my ticket.''</p>
        <p>The $11 billion ice cream industry is still a franchise business, even though corporate mergers have lately lumped together competing brands like Ben &amp; Jerry's, Breyer's and Good Humor. The 600 Mister Softees  nationwide usually own or lease their trucks, and carefully guard their routes.</p>
        <p>In the suburbs, a route, or territory, may be miles long. In Manhattan, it may be a street corner. In 1956, when James Conway and his brother, William, founded Mister Softee Inc. in Runnemede, N.J., the territories were broad and uncontested. Today, the 30-odd territories in Manhattan are about 10 blocks square. Since last year, because of city vendor restrictions, a Mister Softee must inherit or be assigned a territory.</p>
        <p>All of which makes Mr. Laws a lucky man; each morning after he loads up his new $85,000 General Motors truck, he drives to one of the prime territories on the island: Golda Meir Square at 39th Street and Broadway. On weekends, he moves to 35th Street. Other top-selling intersections include Columbus Circle and Wall Street. The mix of tourists and fashionistas at 39th Street keeps Mr. Laws busy, unless what he calls a ''competition truck,'' rolls by.</p>
        <p>''See?'' he said. ''There's one right there!'' He grimaced as he pulled onto 39th Street at Fifth Avenue. Sitting in the shadow of Lord &amp; Taylor was a battered 1961 Ford Mister Softee truck, repainted with the words ''Mister Soft Ice Cream.'' It was serving a line of customers five deep.</p>
        <p>''What upsets me is that I'm here every day,'' Mr. Laws said. ''If someone gets sick, I'm here, accountable. If someone gets hurt from eating at a competition truck, who are they going to call? Sometimes they can only remember one name: 'Mister Softee.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laws estimates that there are 100 non-Mister Softee trucks in the city. Specific figures are difficult to find because most of the companies are small and unlisted. But they are legal, and if they flit from corner to corner, that is their business. Sometimes they even play the Mister Softee jingle. Mister Softees hate that.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, Good Humor was the big competition; today, it is Kustard King. The Mister Soft Ice Cream truck on 39th Street is part of a relatively new company with 20 trucks citywide, as a later visit revealed. The driver was unwilling to give his name. But he said he sold in Manhattan from noon to 6 p.m. daily before heading to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to roam the streets until after dark. He takes home $80 a day.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Laws complains about the competition, his business is good. Even on days that are not ideal ice cream weather -- 70 degrees is best, over 95 is worst -- a line forms when he opens shop at 11 a.m. and never lets up until he pulls away at 7 p.m. On weekends, he stays until 9 p.m., or until his feet start throbbing. And though it takes him three hours to make the $200 in supplies he buys each morning, his profit is at least $150 a day, or around $25,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''If you're good to them, you'll be around,'' he said of his customers. ''I can't be more than just me, but if you respect them, they'll be back. That's the secret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laws is in the business of customers as well as ice cream, and he is popular because he knows this. He is deliberately outgoing. He studies his customers and keeps track of their names and favorite cones. He calls them Pops and Buddy and Pal. He congratulates them when they are pregnant and he plays pick-up basketball with them when they need an extra player. When adults are too embarrassed to ask for rainbow sprinkles, he laughs and cajoles them, saying: ''Come on, man! You got to go with the sprinkles!'' They always do.</p>
        <p>Some nights, he said, as he drives home to Astoria, Queens, he almost feels as if he has spent the day with friends. That may be  sentimental, but Mister Softee has always thrived on sentiment. Mister Softee is nostalgia to go, and Mr. Laws likes dishing it out. Perhaps he is a softie, after all.</p>
        <p>''We've got a history here,'' he said near day's end, his truck swathed in a skyscraper's shadow. ''Why do people love watching 'Titanic?' They love history. And why do people still eat Mister Softee? They love the smiles.''</p>
