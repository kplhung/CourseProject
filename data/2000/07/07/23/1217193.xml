        <p>Because the Yankees have been in first place since the All-Star Game, they have not been in the wild-card race. But they have not been so far in first place that they have not had to notice the wild-card race. And when they look at the wild-card race, what do they see? A couple of American League West teams as close to them as their own breaths.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the West is challenging the East as the dominant division in the league. The Yankees, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox? They have nothing on the Seattle Mariners, the Anaheim Angels and the Oakland Athletics.</p>
        <p>The West trio is a collective seven and a half games ahead of the East trio. The Athletics and the Angels, in a virtual tie for the wild-card lead, are only are only 1 and 2 percentage points, respectively, shy of the first-place Yankees. More than two months remain in the season, but before the wild-card race is over, the Yankees could find out how well they had it when they had huge division leads and did not have to pay attention to the teams fighting for the fourth playoff spot.</p>
        <p>Bill Stoneman, for one, is not surprised at the developments in the new West. He is the first-year general manager of the Angels, a team that has extricated itself from the muck engendered by a dysfunctional family and become a playoff contender.</p>
        <p>''Everybody looked at the division with skepticism,'' said Stoneman, not only the leader of a division contender but also a cheerleader for the division. ''Everybody but those of us in the American League West. I don't think this is a surprise. It's happening because there are some good clubs out here. If it hadn't been for some injuries, Texas might be right with us and they're close.''</p>
        <p>And then Stoneman added, ''It's possible and maybe even likely that the wild-card club will come out of here.''</p>
        <p>What a shock that would be to the East, especially if the Yankees should slip out of first and join the ''fourth-division'' race.</p>
        <p>It was mid- to late May when the Angels and the Athletics had losing records. But in the last nine weeks the Angels have compiled a 34-24 record (.586, translating to 95 victories for the season), and in nearly 8 weeks the Athletics have a 27-18 record (.600, or 97 victories).</p>
        <p>The Yankees, in comparison, have had a 28-33 record since May 10, a .459 winning percentage that would produce 74 victories for the season.</p>
        <p>The Athletics have surprised no one because they served notice last season that they were ready to play for the playoffs. The Angels, on the other hand, began the season as an unknown. They had a collection of good young players, but the team was devastated by internal turmoil last season and no one knew if they would suffer a lasting effect.</p>
        <p>It is now obvious they have not.</p>
        <p>With Mike Scioscia, the new manager, providing a calming presence, the Angels' young players have performed so well that Stoneman credits them with providing the foundation for the team's good play.</p>
        <p>''The one thing we didn't know,'' he said, ''was how comfortable would some of the younger guys be, most particularly our young starting pitchers and our catcher and our second baseman. How would they perform and how comfortable would they be at this level for the season? I think we're finding out to our delight that they belong here.''</p>
        <p>Adam Kennedy, acquired with Kent Bottenfield in the Jim Edmonds trade, has been the second baseman all season, playing in all but three games. Bengie Molina has been the primary catcher. Brian Cooper, Seth Etherton and Jarrod Washburn make up three-fifths of the active starting rotation.</p>
        <p>Kennedy, Molina, Cooper and Etherton are rookies, Washburn not far removed from rookie status. The three pitchers began the season in the minor leagues.</p>
        <p>Then there are the members of the team who are more experienced than that group but still young: Darin Erstad, Troy Glaus, Garret Anderson.</p>
        <p>''Who'da thunk it -- 26 home runs at the break?'' Stoneman said, discussing Anderson's career-high contribution. Who could have anticipated Erstad's 160-hit contribution, giving him 29 more hits than the next most prolific hitter?</p>
        <p>But third baseman Glaus, at 23 the youngest regular, had a .618 slugging percentage, best on the team.</p>
        <p>Did someone mention Edmonds?</p>
        <p>''We knew all winter and almost all spring that four outfielders didn't fit into three positions,'' said Stoneman, who also had Anderson, Erstad and Tim Salmon. ''All four were quality outfielders. Something was going to give here. It helped us fill second base and stabilize our starting pitching, particularly at the start of the year. It gave us a little bit of leadership.''</p>
        <p>Bottenfield, as it developed, has the only losing record (6-8) among the starting pitchers. But that's the beauty of the development of the young Angels, to have Washburn at 6-2, Etherton 5-1 and Cooper 4-4.</p>
        <p>''You can't just single out the young guys,'' Stoneman said, ''but they've been the surprise.''</p>
        <p>Larkin Disconnected</p>
        <p>For a long time, callers to the Cincinnati Reds offices were greeted by a recording: ''Hi, this is Barry Larkin. Thanks for calling the Cincinnati Reds. It's always nice to hear from a fan.''</p>
        <p>A caller mentioned to Jim Bowden, the Reds' general manager, Friday afternoon that if he traded the team's shortstop, the Reds would have to change the greeting.</p>
        <p>''We probably should do that anyway,'' Bowden said.</p>
        <p>Several hours later the voice of an anonymous woman had replaced Larkin. ''Thank you for calling the Cincinnati Reds,'' she said. She did not announce that the Reds had traded her predecessor to the Mets, contingent on his approving the deal, which he apparently is unlikely to do.</p>
        <p>''We want to do what Barry wants,'' Bowden had said, without disclosing the trade. ''We have a lot of respect for what he's done for us, so if he feels it's in his best interests to be traded now, we'll trade him. If he wants to finish the year with the Reds, he'll finish the year with the Reds.''</p>
        <p>Bowden said he had met on July 8 with Larkin, who has spent his entire 14-year career with the Reds. ''He said he wanted to be signed or be traded,'' Bowden said. ''He wanted it behind him. He didn't want all the negativity. If we can't pay him the $27.9 million he wants -- and it's not negotiable -- and we can't sign him, we should trade him.''</p>
        <p>Bowden sounded as sad as he was deliriously delighted when he acquired Ken Griffey Jr.</p>
        <p>''I always envisioned him finishing his career with the Reds,'' the general manager said, ''have his last at-bat with the Reds, take his jersey off and carry it to left field and put it on the wall. But things have changed.''</p>
        <p>Anderson-Type Player</p>
        <p>Sparky Anderson, who goes into the Hall of Fame today, would have loved Shane Halter. The former Cincinnati and Detroit manager loved to use players at different positions -- the ubiquitous Tony Phillips was a favorite -- and Halter would have been perfect to have on the bench.</p>
        <p>Halter is on the Tigers' bench now, that is, he is there when he is not playing one of the positions on the field. This season he has played all but the one on the mound, and he has started at all of the others except the one behind the plate.</p>
        <p>Halter, 30, with 3 years in the majors, has started 5 games at first base, 1 game at second, 6 at shortstop, 12 at third, 1 each in left field and right and 3 in center. He also caught one inning in a July 4 game against Tampa Bay. Before the season is over, maybe he will have an opportunity to match his 1998 experience -- he pitched an inning, a scoreless inning, for Kansas City.</p>
        <p>Denny Hocking of Minnesota has not started at all of the positions Halter has, but he has made more starts: 15 at second, 7 at short, 8 at third, 8 in left, 7 in center, 6 in right, a total of 51 to Halter's 29. Terry Shumpert of Colorado has started 32 games at 6 positions: 1 at first, 9 at second, 2 at short, 6 at third, 13 in left and 1 as designated hitter.</p>
        <p>Jason Maxwell, a Twins rookie, has become a junior Hocking, starting 23 games at four different positions: 9 at second, 1 at short, 12 at third, 1 in right.</p>
        <p>Joe McEwing has not played as much with the Mets as he did with St. Louis last season (128 starts at 5 different positions), but he has displayed his versatility: 4 starts at second, 3 at third, 6 in left, 10 in center.</p>
        <p>Undercutting Robinson</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson has been labeled the dean of discipline, but it is not likely that he will hold the position beyond this season if Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, continues to slice his sentences.</p>
        <p>The latest reduced suspension was for Pete Vuckovich, Pittsburgh's pitching coach.</p>
        <p>When Leonard Coleman was National League president, he fined Vuckovich for his choice of vulgar phrases in arguments with umpires. Last month the coach brought out some of the best of Vuckovich and also bumped umpire John Hirschbeck in an argument over a balk call. Robinson suspended him for three games; Beeston lowered it to two.</p>
        <p>In deciding the discipline for Carl Everett after he twice bumped umpire Ron Kulpa, Robinson was apparently leaning toward a longer sentence than the 10 games he issued, 12 games perhaps. But baseball lawyers urged him to make the suspension no longer than 10 games. If Beeston reduces this one on appeal, it could nudge Robinson closer to suspending his position.</p>
