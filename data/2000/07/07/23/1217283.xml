        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>If winning were based mainly on money, as baseball's latest economic study suggests (''Plan Would Aid Baseball's Middle Class,'' July 15), why are two of the teams with the most money, the Orioles and the Dodgers, at the bottom of the standings? And why does the team with the best record in baseball, the Chicago White Sox, have one of the lowest payrolls?</p>

        <p>Maybe good managing beats more money. What baseball needs to become more competitive is for Joe Torre of the Yankees and Jerry Manuel of the White Sox to give management-training seminars in the off-season.</p>
