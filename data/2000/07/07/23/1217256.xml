        <p>The little-known Mamadou Thiam of France likened his challenge tonight against Felix (Tito) Trinidad, the defending World Boxing Association superwelterweight champion, to ''climbing to the top of the mountain.'' Trinidad's retort: ''All I can say is when he gets near the top, he may slip.''</p>
        <p>Thiam did slip, and fast.</p>
        <p>Trinidad, of Puerto Rico, weakened Thiam with an avalanche of punches in the first round and Referee Jorge Alonso stopped the fight at 2:48 of the third. The technical knockout enabled Trinidad to retain his W.B.A. title before a largely pro-Trinidad crowd of about 15,000, including 12,506 paid, at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>The victory improved Trinidad's career record to 38-0. Thiam, who has fought almost exclusively in France, dropped to 33-2.</p>
        <p>''It was a good fight, a hard fight,'' Trinidad said. ''It feels good to win for my country.''</p>
        <p>HBO Sports sought this fight, said Kery Davis, the cable network's vice president for programming, because Thiam impressed him ''as a bigger, stronger Ike Quartey,'' a boxer who once gave Oscar De La Hoya a difficult fight.</p>
        <p>It did not turn out to be one of Davis's better assessments.</p>
        <p>Weighing the maximum 154 pounds for the division, Trinidad established an edge midway through the first round. He caught Thiam with a left hook that sent him reeling. Trinidad swarmed in, throwing lefts and rights in a pistonlike manner.</p>
        <p>The crowd quickly began chanting, ''Tito, Tito, Tito,'' as leather hit skin, Thiam's skin. Thiam appeared hurt for a while, though he bounced back to chase Trinidad around the ring with a flurry of punches that mostly did not find their mark.</p>
        <p>Trinidad succeeded in opening a cut above Thiam's right eye, and that later would be telltale.</p>
        <p>Even so, Thiam continued as the aggressor early in the second round and stayed game until the end. Soon, though, Trinidad's lightning-quick punches became too much for him.</p>
        <p>As Thiam was sizing up his opponent, Trinidad would often jolt him with an uppercut or a hook. Some punches even came from a flatfooted stance.</p>
        <p>''I was very, very conscious when they called it,'' Thiam said. ''But for the future, it may have been best,'' he added, referring to his eye injury.</p>
        <p>Trinidad connected on 96 of the 175 punches he threw in the fight. And 72 of his 118 power punches were true. Meanwhile, Thiam landed just 34 of his 136 punches, a woeful 25 percent.</p>
        <p>''He is so strong,'' the French announcer Christian Delcourt said of Thiam. ''If he had landed just one good punch, it could have made a difference.''</p>
        <p>This was the first high-profile title fight in this city since Pernell Whitaker won a 12-round decision against Wilfredo Rivera for the World Boxing Council welterweight title in 1996. And Trinidad's followers made it memorable, with their banners and Puerto Rican flags and unabashed adulation for him.</p>
        <p>Trinidad and his manager, trainer and father, Felix Sr., form one of the few successful father-son combinations in boxing.</p>
        <p>''It has not always been a bed of roses,'' Felix Sr. said. ''There were some difficult situations. But at the moment of truth, we both came to an understanding. My son is very cooperative. We have never had problems as far as the training aspect. Of course, all fathers and sons will have their moments. But I respect what he has to say. In the end, we both came to an agreement.''</p>
        <p>Trinidad, who defeated three Olympic gold medalists in a row before facing Thiam, now appears headed for a December match against the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion, Fernando Vargas (19-0). But first Vargas is expected to defend his title against Ross Thompson on Aug. 26.</p>
        <p>''It's a fight we want,'' the promoter Don King said, meaning Trinidad versus Vargas.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>In a free-swinging World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight title fight, ENER JULIO of Colombia won a split decision against Miami's previously unbeaten RANDALL BAILEY. By the end, Bailey's right eye was closed and he had a glaring lump on his forehead.</p>
