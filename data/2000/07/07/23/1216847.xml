        <p>TOUR  By Covered Wagon</p>
        <p>Two-hour mule-driven covered-wagon tours of the 20,000-acre Coachella Valley Preserve are now available out of Palm Springs, Calif.</p>
        <p>The excursions, by Covered Wagon Tours, stop along the San Andreas Fault to see how earthquakes have changed the desert, producing oases and pushing up hills. Guests have the option to end the tour with a sunset cookout and country music. Wagons have padded seats and pneumatic tires. The dinner tour is $55; the tour only, $40. Ages 7 to 16 are half price; ages 6 and under are free. Call (800) 367-2161.</p>

        <p>CRUISE  Now, Dental Work on Deck</p>
        <p>A service travelers hope they won't need is now offered by the 1,440-passenger Zaandam, Holland America's newest ship, which started an on-board dental-care program when it was launched in May.</p>
        <p>The service, provided by Sea Dentist, a Michigan company, is meant primarily for the ship's crew, but passengers can be treated as well.</p>
        <p>Dental care includes such procedures as repairs of partial dentures ($175) and the recementing of crowns ($75).</p>
