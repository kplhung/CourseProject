        <p>Jimmy Makar suddenly noticed something wrong with Bobby Labonte's bright green race car Friday afternoon.

        <p>Makar, laughing, would say later that such minor surgery would probably not make a bit of difference when the Pennsylvania 500 was run Sunday. But you never know.

        <p>Jimmy Makar suddenly noticed something wrong with Bobby Labonte's bright green race car Friday afternoon. Makar strode purposefully over to the front fender, fished in his pocket, pulled out a pocketknife, then meticulously whittled away a loose sliver of fluorescent red tape no more than a quarter-inch wide.</p>
        <p>Makar, laughing, would say later that such minor surgery would probably not make a bit of difference when the Pennsylvania 500 was run Sunday. But you never know. The crew chief of the top car on the Nascar Winston Cup circuit cannot afford to take chances, especially not with Labonte in the middle of a bristling points race.</p>
        <p>''We don't let the little things slide as much as we used to,'' Makar said.</p>
        <p>With only 18 of 34 races complete, the race for the Winston Cup championship is far from decided. Labonte, the quiet 36-year-old driver from Corpus Christi, Tex., holds only a 45-point lead over Dale Earnhardt and a 68-point lead over Dale Jarrett. Labonte's momentum has been slipping, if only slightly.</p>
        <p>Labonte has not won since the second race of the year. He has finished in the top five in only one of his last four races. He is not even the hottest driver in his owner Joe Gibbs's formidable racing garage. That would be Tony Stewart, 29, who has gained four places in the points standing in the last six races and smashed the track qualifying record here Friday with a lap at 172.391 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>This is where Labonte's approach to driving comes into play. His approach to life, actually.</p>
        <p>He does not seem to be too upset about being locked in a battle with two former champions for his first Winston Cup championship. He just spent eight days on vacation with his family, far away from the team's garage.</p>
        <p>After he posted the 13th-fastest qualifying time for Sunday's race, Labonte climbed the steps to the roof of his team's trailer to calmly review the run with Makar, then stayed there for a long time. Most drivers disappear quickly after qualifying.</p>
        <p>''We don't worry about it,'' Labonte said of the points race. ''We let other people worry about it for us.''</p>
        <p>And then there was just a hint of a grin. Labonte, who finished second a year ago to Jarrett, is pretty much where he wants to be. The team has not changed its approach too radically from last year, when Labonte won five races and led a substantially higher percentage of laps.</p>
        <p>The team simply has been more consistent. Labonte has finished every race. He has finished lower than 13th only twice. The idea is still to win, not just to run near the front.</p>
        <p>''But you end up being consistent if you run for wins,'' he said.</p>
        <p>You also apparently end up having more fun, which, in turn, leads to more success.</p>
        <p>''You look at that '18' bunch, and they're all excited about being there,'' Earnhardt said recently, referring to Labonte's team by his car number.</p>
        <p>Now Labonte has another valuable ally in Stewart. As soon as Stewart set the track record Friday, Makar hustled over to Stewart's garage for some inside information from the crew chief Greg Zipadelli on how Stewart did it. ''We share everything but households and credit cards,'' Stewart said.</p>
        <p>Labonte, meanwhile, has started working on some other things. His older brother, Terry, who won Winston Cup championships in 1984 and 1996, has always been the more visible and quotable of the Labontes, but Bobby is working on catching up. After Labonte climbed off the roof of his trailer, he was swarmed by fans lucky enough to have a garage pass. He signed two photos, a cap and a T-shirt, then posed for two more photos.</p>
        <p>''We've noticed a big increase in his time demands,'' said Tim Sullivan, the team's publicist.</p>
        <p>And yet Labonte knows it will not mean anything if he loses his grip on the lead.</p>
        <p>He has held the lead for nine races now, and if he can keep it through the first week in September, he will be in great shape. Only one of the last seven Winston Cup points leaders going into the last 10 races of the season has lost his lead. That was Mark Martin in 1997.</p>
