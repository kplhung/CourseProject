        <p>MISTER SOFTEE, 39th Street at Broadway, northwest corner  The vanilla flavor is pronounced and fairly genuine. The ice cream has some weight to it and a silky texture. The pale yellow cone, embossed with the word Mellow, seems to be standard issue for all soft ice-cream trucks. It resembles thin particle board, has no flavor whatever and sucks the moisture out of your tongue on contact. The vendor has a deft wrist, producing an attractive ziggurat form topped by a perfect curled peak. He also wishes customers a hearty ''Have a great day'' on delivering the cone. Price, $1.50.  Rating: Three cones (out of four)</p>
        <p>SOFT ICE CREAM 1, 39th Street at Fifth Avenue, southwest corner  The ice cream, tasteless and a little grainy, suffers from poor presentation. The vendor, who has not mastered the art of simultaneously piling, pressing and twisting the ice cream, ends up with an unstable Leaning Tower of Pisa. The cone is offered grudgingly. Crude depiction of a vanilla cone on the side of the van shows a cherry on top. No cherry on actual cone. Price, $1.50.  Rating: zero cones</p>

        <p>SOFT ICE CREAM 2, 45th Street at Seventh Avenue, northeast corner  A mild, not overly artificial vanilla flavor and reasonably creamy texture make this a respectable, middle-of-the-road cone. The vendor, who has a supple wrist, gives his cones a slightly squashed form, with precise spirals, that recalls one of the onion towers on St. Basil's Cathedral. The manner is brisk but not unfriendly. Price, $1.50.  Rating: two cones</p>
