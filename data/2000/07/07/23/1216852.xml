        <p>Although the cosmos of wines offers glittering values, Riedel glassware expands the total experience immeasurably. A one-time splurge on glass pays compound interest on virtually every wine purchase.</p>
        <p>Although I've used Riedel stemware designed for various wines for tastings at home, mostly I have relied on one-size-fits-all pinched-waist glasses that concentrate and retain aromas and flavors.</p>
        <p>But I recently acquired the cabernet-merlot glass in Riedel's slightly ornate, midpriced Wine series, released last year, and though the owner, Georg Riedel, might disapprove, I have used it experimentally for all still wines. I have sampled scores of wines side by side in the Riedel and the old reliable glasses. Each time, the Riedel enhanced them: Remember, smell governs taste.</p>
        <p>As I kept my nose in the oversize 9 1/4-inch-high cabernet glass with a 2 3/4-inch mouth for minutes on end, the wines' structures and flavors grew magnified and hitherto undetectable nuances (and flaws, like too much alcohol) announced themselves. (The Riedel works wonders with East End merlots and cabernet francs.)</p>
        <p>Some years ago, I had the same experience when using expensive Riedels in an afternoon's dialogue with the movingly brilliant rieslings and spatburgunders (pinot noirs) made by Weingut J. B. Becker in the Rheingau region of Germany. At the time, Riedels seemed extravagantly pricey, and I bought none. Years of potential knowledge lost!</p>
        <p>Riedels must be treated gingerly, individually washed and hand-dried, and stored with bowls upright to avoid absorbing shelf odors. Glasses in the series, typically $17.50 each, come in four-packs.</p>
        <p>Many Long Island wine merchants will special-order them for customers. Riedels are carried by Michael's, 802 East Main Street, Riverhead; Amagansett Wine and Spirits, 203 Main Street, Amagansett, and Post Liquors, 510 Jericho Turnpike, Syosset.</p>
