        <p>WEEKS ago, when officials here put individual tax information on the Internet, opposition came from the most unlikely source: the town clerk, Alfreda A. Williams. She was no stranger to documenting information, having spent the last seven years recording everything from births to deaths to dog licenses. But she did not like the idea that the click of a mouse could give anyone a titillating glimpse of people's most intimate living spaces, from the size and shape of bedrooms and baths to whether a house is split level or ranch, has a pool or a fireplace.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather not have perfect strangers knowing the proportions of the rooms in my house and how much my taxes are,'' Ms. Williams said.</p>

        <p>WEEKS ago, when officials here put individual tax information on the Internet, opposition came from the most unlikely source: the town clerk, Alfreda A. Williams. She was no stranger to documenting information, having spent the last seven years recording everything from births to deaths to dog licenses. But she did not like the idea that the click of a mouse could give anyone a titillating glimpse of people's most intimate living spaces, from the size and shape of bedrooms and baths to whether a house is split level or ranch, has a pool or a fireplace.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather not have perfect strangers knowing the proportions of the rooms in my house and how much my taxes are,'' Ms. Williams said.</p>
        <p>Greenburgh's decision to put such information on the Internet adds a new chapter to the nationwide controversy about what is private and what is public and which information should be available online.</p>
        <p>Newspaper headlines fuel the debate, reporting, for example, that an accused New Jersey burglar went online to select houses as targets in wealthy New York and New Jersey neighborhoods. And in Westchester, nine men have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to sexually abusing boys as young as 13 whom they met through the Internet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Williams was not alone in her opposition to the local Web site. Some in town have called the site a ''predator's dream.'' Many have said worse. Days after the town put the assessment records of all 27,000 parcels of land, homes and storefronts on its Web site (17,000 are residences) Ms. Williams told Gennaro Iagallo, the town assessor, to remove her data from the files. Dozens of others have done the same in a kind of grassroots rebellion against the new policy.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Feiner, the town supervisor, who, like Ms. Williams is a Democrat, has characterized the Web listing as a key to open government. Full access to records, 24 hours a day, Mr. Feiner said, makes bureaucracy more efficient. The information is already available to anyone who arrives at Town Hall in person. Immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiner said all of the benefits outweigh the breach of privacy concerns. People can determine on the Web if their taxes are fair. They can check their tax bills against those of their neighbors. And, he said, the town is pre-empting the unavoidable by putting on the Internet information that some future e-business entrepreneur will undoubtedly gather and place there anyway for a fee.</p>
        <p>But some Internet privacy experts are not swayed by those arguments. They say that when such a policy is adopted, it must be well thought out and carefully planned.</p>
        <p>''The goal was: 'Let's have a Web page. Let's have this information out and put it on the Web and call it open government,' '' said Alex R. Fowler, senior director of policy and advocacy at Zero-Knowledge Systems, a Montreal company that builds privacy software and one who has surfed Greenburgh's site. ''And that isn't how anyone would design open government.''</p>
        <p>There was no hearing on the issue. Even Mr. Iagallo acknowledged last week that it has been a process of ''learning as we go'' in the Information Age. ''I kind of look at it like Christopher Columbus, who got in a boat and just started traveling,'' Mr. Iagallo said. But then, as Mr. Iagallo said, Columbus got terribly lost before he wound up in America.</p>
        <p>Putting municipal assessment data on the Internet is a fairly new phenomenon, which only a handful of municipalities have done, according to the New York State Office of Real Property Services. The city of Olean and Schenectady and Tompkins Counties provide assessment information on the Web.</p>
        <p>The village of Scarsdale used to, until opposition forced officials there to shut the site down in April after just two weeks.</p>
        <p>The whole issue has even received attention from candidates in campaigns across the state and across the country this year.</p>
        <p>Sensing people's growing fears about details of their lives falling into the hands of wrongdoers, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have begun speaking out about protecting private information. And debates in Congress have tackled the issue of guarding the privacy of medical and financial records on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Locally, the Greenburgh Town Board voted in February to put what is known as the town's Geographic Information System on the Internet as of June 26. The information can be found at www.gis.town.greenburgh .ny.us. The system cost about $20,000 to start up, Mr. Iagallo said. Any of the town's 87,000 residents wanting to opt out of the Web site can either mail their request, along with proof of residency, to the town assessor or go to his office.</p>
        <p>Besides assessment information, which includes floor plans, color photographs of house exteriors are available in some cases. The name of the homeowner and whether that person has a senior citizen's property tax exemption is also available, which opponents of the site believe could make the elderly more of a prey to criminals. Others said the site is a telemarketer's ideal research engine. There are also lists of recent sale prices of homes in Greenburgh and its six villages.</p>
        <p>In the future, the town would like to provide building plans, permit records and zoning maps as well as crime statistics and other departmental data. Someday, residents in the 31-square-mile town may be able to trace delinquent taxes and make payments by means of a home computer.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Freeman, executive director for the New York State Committee on Open Government, said a person's ability to access the records, ''to determine whether the government is treating you fairly, outweighs the minimal invasion of privacy that occurs when the assessment record is disclosed.''</p>
        <p>But having records held in metal file cabinets inside a building in the center of town is different from sending them out by modem on the Internet, many residents say. How swiftly the Web site has been activated has fostered a debate not about whether the release of every piece of available information is legal but about whether it is more harmful than helpful.</p>
        <p>The answers seem to be working themselves out day by day.</p>
        <p>''We recognize the value to New York State's taxpayers of improved access to information regarding assessment administration in their communities,'' said Geoffrey T. Gloak, a spokesman for the state's Office of Real Property Services. ''However, we are also cognizant of issues surrounding the privacy of New York's citizens.''</p>
        <p>Ella M. Preiser, a member of the Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, an umbrella organization for 34 community groups, fears that the policy may undermine security for people like her son, a Greenburgh police officer who for years has paid extra for an unlisted phone number.</p>
        <p>''He cannot protect his family if you can go on the Net and find directions to his house, and even a picture,'' Ms. Preiser said. ''We have a few nuts out in this world who have ulterior motives for finding and getting information.''</p>
        <p>Francis X. Sheehan, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and is a member of the town's Zoning Board of Appeals, said he was worried that the Web site provides ''increased information for pedophiles to use.''</p>
        <p>Carol A. Wielk, a member of Grassroots for Greenburgh, said information on single women and elderly homeowners could end up in hostile hands.</p>
        <p>The Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations on Tuesday passed a resolution calling for the site to be shut down immediately ''until serious privacy issues and site design flaws are addressed.'' Mr. Feiner called that option doubtful.</p>
        <p>In Scarsdale, where some property tax bills reach as high as $100,000 a year, questions about privacy caused real estate and tax information to be taken offline until the Village Board can decide on the issue, E. Markham Bench, the mayor of Scarsdale, said. A committee there, he said, has suggested that no access to records be granted by name and that passwords be issued to residents.</p>
        <p>''People are concerned about safety and privacy,'' Mr. Bench said. ''Payment history and delinquency even on water bills didn't need to be provided to the entire world via the Internet.''</p>
        <p>In Greenburgh, Mr. Iagallo, the assessor, said that since some residents have complained, the town has reversed its policy of allowing access to the records by name. Mr. Feiner said he is listed by name, but Mr. Iagallo said some days the supervisor is listed and some days he isn't because he lives in a condominium and there is a glitch that causes inconsistency in the listings.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sheehan said this week that one could still access records by name. Mr. Feiner, the supervisor, said if that is true then it is a glitch ''that we will have to take a look at.'' Mr. Iagallo said no one has shown proof of being able to do that. Ms. Wielk said a search by street brings up residents' names anyway. The council of civic groups said the site allows downloading and printing, options they said the town agreed not to allow but that Mr. Feiner said are being studied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiner said the town is considering use of a tool that would identify any browser on the site, but that might raise other Internet privacy issues. He said that other security measures, including passwords and fees, are also being considered and that the town is setting up a task force, with law enforcement officials to look into the concerns.</p>
        <p>Critics who have examined Greenburgh's Web site said the absence of a disclosure statement is a glaring omission: no explanation of the town's rationale is offered.</p>
        <p>''The information feels like it is out of the control of the person it is about,'' Mr. Fowler, of Zero-Knowledge Systems, said.</p>
        <p>To Ms. Williams, the Greenburgh clerk, the issue is crystal clear. ''I don't like any of it,'' she said. ''I don't think it's necessary for people to know anymore about me than what I want to tell them.''</p>
