        <p>Combining a mix that blends Target's knowing design panache with compatriot Ikea's easily negotiated layout, H&amp;M has 613 stores in 14 countries.</p>
        <p>With a sharply defined focus on runway trends and street-wise looks, the stores appeal to shoppers who want the latest fashion, accessories and cosmetics at flea-market prices, like men's cotton shirts for $9, women's tank tops for under $6 and fringed suede bags for $9.</p>
        <p>''The merchandise is also so trendy that one thing all clients have for sure in common is that they are fashion oriented,'' a spokeswoman for H &amp; M said.</p>
