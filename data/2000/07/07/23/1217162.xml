        <p>An article on July 2 about doctors who give journalists free beauty and health treatments with the expectation of being featured in articles misstated the types of procedures provided without cost by a dermatologist, Dr. David Bank. He has performed laser treatments and a hyperbaric oxygen treatment on journalists, but not chemical peels, botox injections or liposuction. The article also misstated the frequency with which Dr. Bank performed free treatments. He does not do them often; he has done them intermittently in the last four years.</p>
