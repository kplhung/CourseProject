        <p>An Imported Nuisance</p>
        <p>Q: A bird-watching friend informs me that the house sparrow was once far more common in New York City than the pigeon. What happened?</p>
        <p>A.: House sparrows were introduced to North America in 1854, when the Brooklyn Institute, hoping to limit the local population of canker worms, released several pairs inside Green-Wood Cemetery. The pugnacious, chattering little birds bred with lightning speed, but did not devour the canker worm in significant numbers. Instead, they ate seeds, fruits and grains as well as insects;  displaced or harassed native bird populations, and carried diseases.  The sparrows thrived where horses were present, and in the city feasted on the oats and seeds that fell from feed bags or remained undigested in the manure piles on the street.</p>

        <p>An Imported Nuisance</p>
        <p>Q: A bird-watching friend informs me that the house sparrow was once far more common in New York City than the pigeon. What happened?</p>
        <p>A.: House sparrows were introduced to North America in 1854, when the Brooklyn Institute, hoping to limit the local population of canker worms, released several pairs inside Green-Wood Cemetery. The pugnacious, chattering little birds bred with lightning speed, but did not devour the canker worm in significant numbers. Instead, they ate seeds, fruits and grains as well as insects;  displaced or harassed native bird populations, and carried diseases.  The sparrows thrived where horses were present, and in the city feasted on the oats and seeds that fell from feed bags or remained undigested in the manure piles on the street.</p>
        <p>The city's house sparrow population peaked alongside that of the city horses, between 1890 and 1913. A commission was established to study the nuisance, but poisons, traps, bounties and natural predators failed to thin their ranks. In the end, it was the automobile that defeated the little sparrow, which despite its name, is a species of wood finch. As horses, feed bags and manure slowly faded from the streets, barns, stables and other nesting sites disappeared from the city landscape, and the population slowly fell.</p>
        <p>Though not as ubiquitous as they were 80 or 90 years ago, house sparrows can still be seen in abundance in the city, where they tend to nest in eaves and vents, in street lamps and under air-conditioners. The male is brown with black streaks above, a black bib and grayish white below, while the female is dull brown above and brownish white below.</p>
        <p>Dow Behind the Dow</p>
        <p>Q.: Was there a Dow Jones, or a couple of folks, Dow and Jones, who sat down to create the all-too-well-known industrial average?</p>
        <p>A.: Yes. In the 1880's, Charles H. Dow and Edward D. Jones were financial reporters known for their astute market analyses, but it is Dow, the first editor of The Wall Street Journal, who is credited with creating the averages that mirror the whims of capital with such apparent authority.</p>
        <p>Dow and Jones met in Rhode Island in 1876, where both wrote for The Providence Star. In 1879, Dow traveled to Leadville, Colo., to cover the impact of gold and silver discoveries on the West, and there became acquainted with the sachems of the New York financial and industrial world. Dow and Jones met again in New York, where both worked for the Kiernan News Agency, a firm that delivered news reports to the banks and brokerage houses clustered near Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In 1882, Dow, Jones and a third partner formed a similar service called Dow Jones &amp; Company, and the following year began publishing a news sheet recapping the day's major news, a forerunner of The Wall Street Journal. In 1884, seeking a way to identify general trends amid the chaos of the daily market, Dow chose 11 prominent stocks, most of them railroads, and calculated their average price. He compared this Railroad Average to placing sticks along a sandy beach to determine, wave by wave, whether the tide was coming in or going out. In May 1896 he inaugurated the Industrial Average, based on 12 leading stocks, and published it in The Wall Street Journal. It became a daily feature in October of that year.</p>
        <p>Fighting Chance on Foot</p>
        <p>Q.: When did Walk/Don't Walk signs start appearing on corners here? When I was a kid, we just ran across the street when the light was green.</p>
        <p>A.: Flashing pedestrian signals were introduced in 1955, according to Mark Patterson, Department of Transportation spokesman. Before that, children were taught to ''cross at the green, not in between.''</p>
