        <p>The Mets are prepared to go to great lengths to persuade Barry Larkin to join them. But the one thing they are unwilling to do is the one thing Larkin most wants from them. Because the Mets will not give him a contract extension, the 36-year-old Cincinnati Reds shortstop seems likely to stay put.</p>
        <p>Mets General Manager Steve Phillips, who agreed on Thursday to trade three players for Larkin, received permission from the commissioner's office to speak with Larkin, starting this morning at 10 o'clock. The Mets have 72 hours to persuade Larkin to accept the deal, which he must approve because he has 10 years in the majors and the last five with the same team.</p>
        <p>''I think by midday tomorrow, we'll have a good sense of whether we should keep pursuing this or not,'' Phillips said today after the Mets' 4-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>For the Mets, that is discouraging news. When he spoke today with Larkin and his agent, Eric Goldschmidt, Phillips offered to fly to Cincinnati tonight to meet with Larkin. Goldschmidt told Phillips he preferred to continue talking on the telephone -- but there may not be much to say.</p>
        <p>When he made the deal -- most likely sending prospects to Cincinnati -- Phillips told Reds General Manager Jim Bowden he intended to retain Larkin only for the rest of this season.</p>
        <p>''As of now, the Mets have told me they are not willing to sign him for $27.9 million,'' Bowden told reporters today. ''Barry and his agent have informed us if they don't sign him for $27.9 million, then he's going to reject the trade. So based on what I'm hearing, I think at some point it gets rejected.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said Bowden was accurate when he said the Mets did not intend to sign Larkin to a long-term contract. While the Mets could offer Larkin a bonus for agreeing to a deal, the 11-time All-Star and 1995 National League most valuable player, has insisted on an extension from the Reds, who turned down his three-year, $27.9 million request. But Larkin has been with Cincinnati his entire 15-year career and has said he wants to finish his career there, and Bowden said he would not make another deal for Larkin if he rejected this trade.</p>
        <p>Phillips said Manager Bobby Valentine; Larkin's former teammates John Franco and Lenny Harris; plus one or both of the Mets' owners, Nelson Doubleday and Fred Wilpon, were prepared to take Wilpon's private jet to meet Larkin.</p>
        <p>Harris said he had no plans to fly to Cincinnati and he doubted Larkin would be influenced by a meeting. ''Barry just wants to get paid,'' said Harris, one of Larkin's closest friends. ''If they're going to take care of his contract, he'll be here playing. Simple as that.''</p>
        <p>Franco, a native New Yorker who has been with the Mets for a decade, can relate to Larkin's reluctance to leave his hometown. Franco thinks Larkin would ''fit in perfectly'' with the Mets, but he gave no sales pitch when he spoke with Larkin on Friday.</p>
        <p>''If he doesn't come, I understand,'' Franco said. ''It's a tough situation. His whole family is there; he's been there his whole career.''</p>
        <p>Larkin was given a 20-second standing ovation at Cinergy Field today before his first at-bat in the Reds' triumph over Arizona. He went 1 for 5 and is hitting .322 with 10 home runs and 34 runs batted in.</p>
        <p>''It's an emotional roller-coaster,'' said Larkin, who stepped out of the box to take in the cheers. ''I actually thought I might not be here today, but I am.''</p>
        <p>Larkin was noncommittal about whether he would accept the trade, saying he wanted to talk to his family and Goldschmidt.</p>
        <p>''I've heard from a lot of people,'' he said. ''Everybody wants to get a piece because they think the Reds are not going to'' sign him to an extension.</p>
        <p>The Mets are resisting signing Larkin to a long-term deal for two reasons: they have committed $16 million over the next three years to the injured Rey Ordonez and they covet Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who, like Larkin, can be a free agent this winter. But Larkin's skills have not declined markedly with age.</p>
        <p>''I think he still has years ahead of him,'' Phillips said. ''He still is moving well and has his agility, his acceleration in his stride.''</p>
        <p>Phillips said the Mets would not bench the players they had agreed to trade to the Reds. A baseball official said the former No. 1 overall pick Paul Wilson, who has not pitched in the majors since 1996 but is doing well at Class AAA Norfolk, may be part of the package.</p>
        <p>Phillips also said the Larkin trade was not holding up other deals. The Mets continue to explore other trades, with pitching their first priority.</p>
        <p>''Nothing that we're talking about hinges on this,'' he said.</p>
