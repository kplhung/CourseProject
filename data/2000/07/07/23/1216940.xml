        <p>ONE recent afternoon, Ken Braun put the finishing touches on an advertising concept board approved several days earlier by Arthur Stern, his client.

        <p>As C.E.O. of Cogswell Realty, which developed the Tech Center, Mr. Stern was not only Mr. Braun's client but also his landlord. About one-quarter of Mr. Braun's clients are connected to the Tech Center in one way or another, as are many of his collaborators and strategic partners.</p>

        <p>ONE recent afternoon, Ken Braun put the finishing touches on an advertising concept board approved several days earlier by Arthur Stern, his client. The board was an aerial view of the Long Island Technology Center in Great River with the words ''dot com'' superimposed graphically on the roof.</p>
        <p>As C.E.O. of Cogswell Realty, which developed the Tech Center, Mr. Stern was not only Mr. Braun's client but also his landlord. About one-quarter of Mr. Braun's clients are connected to the Tech Center in one way or another, as are many of his collaborators and strategic partners.</p>
        <p>The 34-year-old designer said this was one campaign where he could draw from his own experiences in developing the concept.</p>
        <p>''Here you get the sense that everyone is pulling together,'' Mr. Braun said. ''In other words, we're all under one roof, in both senses of the term. And that's the theme of this campaign.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun spoke during a break in the July 13-14 TechMelt event, a business expo extolling the virtues of collaboration and the advantages of strategic partnerships. More than 100 companies, including a number of Mr. Braun's fellow tenants, leased table or booth space. The event was organized by the Long Island Software and Technology Network, or ListNet, which operates the year-old, 360,000-square-foot former Grumman testing facility in partnership with Cogswell and Rudin Management.</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun, a former Madison Avenue art director, decided to start his own agency in 1994, closer to his Holbrook home. ''I looked around and realized I didn't want to be in some storefront commercial space or in one of those sterile office parks,'' declared the 33-year-old designer, whose agency, LoungeLizard.com, takes its name from the reptilian tattoo snaking up his left arm.</p>
        <p>''I'm a walking brand,'' he announced, grinning in his short-sleeved shirt.</p>
        <p>He's also a gregarious marketer. Moving into the Tech Center last year, he quickly loaded his client list with such fellow tenants as Keytrade Online (now officially Patagon USA), Alarm Doctor and Imperial Software.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes people just pop into your office because they see you there and bring their own clients,'' Mr. Braun said. ''You just see people walking around and you start talking. On Long Island it's pretty common to be isolated. You have to plan it if you want to see people. Here, you see people all the time. I really like that.''</p>
        <p>With everyone in one space, plans can be hatched at the last minute, and often that provides some of the best networking. Companies not only find new clients but hook up with new strategic partners, avoiding the need to hire new employees.</p>
        <p>''That's how I met Ken, at an after-work party at Keytrade,'' said Mohit Modgil, a 27-year-old programmer who specializes in developing software to support Web-based businesses. ''When I found out what he was doing for Keytrade, I knew he needed me. I just told him, 'Ken, we'll be working together.' And that's what happened.''</p>
        <p>After that chance meeting, the two men began to solicit new business together. Mr. Braun, a talkative Big Picture guy, takes the lead in romancing the prospect; Mr. Modgil, more reserved, serves as his technical backup. They offer each other advice, support and sometimes business leads.</p>
        <p>Interactions may be casual, but some, like TechMelt, are planned months in advance. ListNet organized TechMelt as a kind of corporate mixer for the New Economy.</p>
        <p>''It's different than the traditional kind of expo, where you show up, sit at your table and wait for people who might become your customers,'' said Arthur (Skip) Luke, vice president of sales for FutureTech Enterprises, based in Holbrook.</p>
        <p>From his place behind a table, Mr. Luke struck up a conversation with Michael Capilets, who works for Executrain, a high-tech training company based in Hauppauge. The two thought their respective companies would be a nice fit, and plan to meet shortly to develop a strategy for a strategic partnership. Futuretech recommends software acquisitions to companies, and Executrain can train employees on software acquired on Futuretech's recommendation.</p>
        <p>Other events aimed at promoting informal partnerships are themselves less formal. At holidays and during the summer, ListNet sponsors programs that encourage socialization, such as golf outings and off-site recreational events. Affinity groups known in geek-speak as sigs, for special interest groups, welcome new members to discuss specialized technological issues.</p>
        <p>Even more casually, tenants mingle in the cafeteria and, on mild summer afternoons, chat outdoors around the picnic tables. In a room known as the Digital Sandbox, a space where Grumman technicians once tested F-14's, tenants hold videoconferences with companies around the world. Seating is flexible, the design Gen-X casual.</p>
        <p>It's all so Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>''When people see what goes on here, they're sometimes surprised this is happening on Long Island,'' said Peter Goldsmith, the ListNet president. ''I hear all the time, 'This seems like Silicon Valley,' or, 'Where am I, Route 128?' ''</p>
        <p>The comparisons are not to size but to business culture. Well-established high-tech regions like Silicon Valley near San Francisco and Route 128 outside Boston are characterized by sheer industry presence and a dominance of local social life. Professionals and executives, managers and technicians are more likely to think of themselves as employed by ''the industry'' rather than a specific company. They tend to see the success of others as expanding the pie. Sometimes called ''coopetition,'' after a mid-90's book by that name by the Silicon Valley guru John Moore, the workstyle is rooted in the collaborative culture of the science lab and the high-tech workshop.</p>
        <p>Long Island, by contrast, was dominated for decades by military contractors like Grumman, Sperry and Fairchild Republic. While those prime contractors all worked systematically with smaller niche firms to meet production quotas, the relationships would hardly be described as informal or collaborative.</p>
        <p>Changes in military procurement patterns in the 1980's toppled the defense contracting giants from their perch atop the Island's economy. The disruption opened the door to a more diversified economy based, in large degree, on software products and services, and a culture that celebrates collaboration and information-sharing.</p>
        <p>While many smaller companies and younger employees have embraced the ways of the new digital economy, the pace of change has been decidedly analog. A year after its opening, the Tech Center just nudged its occupancy rate above 60 percent.</p>
        <p>The partners insist marketing efforts are filling up the building according to plan.</p>
        <p>''Companies are moving in because there is the sense that is where the high-tech economy is, here on Long Island,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''People are starting to look to Long Island to meet their high-tech needs, and this is the first place that they look.''</p>
