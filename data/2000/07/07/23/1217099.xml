        <p>ON a hot July night, the Bowery Ballroom on the Lower East Side was packed with lager-sipping hipsters waiting for the arrival of rock's next big thing. She was an hour late, but when she bounded onto the stage in a floor-length red suede skirt, a white tank top and gold hoop earrings, the crowd chanted her name: ''Ki-na! Ki-na!''</p>
        <p>It was still a full week before the release of Kina's debut album, but many already had learned the words to her songs. They waved hands overhead and mouthed along as she belted the lyrics to ''Girl From the Gutter,'' an ''I told you I was gonna be a star'' anthem that sounds like Alanis Morisette as sung by Tina Turner. ''I hope your hell is filled with magazines,'' Kina sings to doubting former friends. ''And on every page you see a big picture of me.''</p>

        <p>ON a hot July night, the Bowery Ballroom on the Lower East Side was packed with lager-sipping hipsters waiting for the arrival of rock's next big thing. She was an hour late, but when she bounded onto the stage in a floor-length red suede skirt, a white tank top and gold hoop earrings, the crowd chanted her name: ''Ki-na! Ki-na!''</p>
        <p>It was still a full week before the release of Kina's debut album, but many already had learned the words to her songs. They waved hands overhead and mouthed along as she belted the lyrics to ''Girl From the Gutter,'' an ''I told you I was gonna be a star'' anthem that sounds like Alanis Morisette as sung by Tina Turner. ''I hope your hell is filled with magazines,'' Kina sings to doubting former friends. ''And on every page you see a big picture of me.''</p>
        <p>She has the boundless, often angry energy of a young Ms. Turner, and the same never-ending legs, planted wide in a prizefighter's stance. All right, she doesn't do the wigs. She wears her hair in a blond-dyed Afro. But Kina does like skintight red leather pants and stiletto heels. A gut-bucket soul singer with the attitude and style of a rock star, she is the latest of a recent wave of African-American women to break from the rigid formula of contemporary R&amp;B. They're losing the glitzy hair and the nail extensions, the minks and the diamond baguettes, the silky smooth vocals and the often vapid lyrics that have been the hallmarks of R&amp;B acts like Toni Braxton and Destiny's Child, and branching into rough-edged terrain traditionally associated with white rock divas like Ms. Morisette and Sheryl Crow.</p>
        <p>Often dubbed alternative soul, this eclectic group includes Macy Gray, Kelis, Angie Stone and Dionne Farris, singers whose style and musical sensibility vary widely, but all have defied categorization. From Ms. Gray's space woman coveralls to the David Bowie T-shirt worn by Dawn Robinson of the band Lucy Pearl, their crossover appeal comes from the raw looks and sounds and an antifabulous style.</p>
        <p>With the promotional muscle of Dreamworks Records and a high-powered manager, Benny Medina, Kina is poised to break out. MTV has deemed her ''buzzworthy,'' a new artist to watch for. ''Girl From the Gutter'' is being played heavily on Top 40 radio, though it is largely ignored by black stations. And next week, she begins a 30-city tour with the Australian pop-rock band Savage Garden. She has developed a network of celebrity fans, including the designer John Bartlett and the actor Matthew McConaughey, who has  memorized her lyrics and calls her to gush over her record.</p>
        <p>''When I heard that one of her major influences was Led Zeppelin, I thought it was killer,'' Mr. McConaughey said from his home in Los Angeles. ''I mean, just on straight appearance, you wouldn't expect someone who looks like her to be influenced by Led Zeppelin, but after you meet her, you get it, because Kina's really a rocking chick.''</p>
        <p>She's also captured the respect of veteran black singers like Darlene Love and Nona Hendryx. After the Bowery Ballroom show, Ms. Love, the 60's soul powerhouse, came backstage to hug and congratulate her. ''I told her that she reminds me of myself,'' said Ms. Love, known for her no-holds belting. ''She sings from the, heart, she sings without tricks, without doing all those flashy runs.''</p>
        <p>Kina and her crew went by limo to an after-party at Lotus on West 14th Street, where the singer accepted congratulations from Serena Altschul and David Lee Roth. She danced with Mr. Medina, the diminutive, powerfully built music manager best known for shepherding the careers of Will Smith, Puff Daddy and Jennifer Lopez.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Medina's latest star was fading. Kina smiled at her road manager, Brett Goetsch, a rock-and-roll veteran with the immense layered blond hair of a heavy metal star of the 80's. Mr. Goetsch, who has done stints on the road with everyone from Joan Jett to Guns 'n' Roses, nodded back. Time to go.</p>
        <p>Earlier, over coffee at Asia de Cuba in midtown, she acknowledged that the rhythm-and-blues scene needed shaking up. ''R&amp;B is very stale, unfortunately,'' she said. ''I appreciate R&amp;B, but I appreciate the old R&amp;B. It had more substance, even in terms of the lyrical content. Today it's about hits, and it's very producer-driven, very copycat. It's not even real R&amp;B. It has the rhythm, but where's the blues?''</p>
        <p>With her sweaty T-shirts and Stratocaster power chords, it comes as a surprise to hear that she got her start in the soft-core R&amp;B tradition. Born Kina Cosper in Detroit, the home of Motown, she began her career in an En Vogue-knockoff group, a forgotten trio called Brownstone, which had a few hits in the mid-90's. Her look in Brownstone was all flash and flowing tresses. (''That hair wasn't mine -- it was a weave, child.'') Now, she sports plain white undershirts and close-cropped hair, and at her concert last week she kicked off her stiletto heels and pranced barefoot, leading her guitar-driven band through a tight set that included Sly Stone's ''I Want to Take You Higher.''</p>
        <p>''In Brownstone, I replaced a member who had left,'' she said. ''The thing is, Brownstone had established a sound before I got there. I was in the group for about two and half years, but it wasn't really what I'm about musically.''</p>
        <p>Kina is a case study in the traps of today's narrowly segmented music business. She felt that the way to break into the industry was with a highly pasteurized ''urban'' sound, even though her real roots were in more free-spirited rock.</p>
        <p>With a roll of her eyes she recalled how an uncle used to blast his eclectic record collection in Detroit. ''I didn't love Jean-Luc Ponty or Hiroshima or the Rolling Stones back then,'' she said. ''I do now, but as a kid I was embarrassed by it. Everybody else's mom was listening to Barry White, but in my house Hiroshima and Led Zeppelin were always playing.''</p>
        <p>After Brownstone broke up, Kina tried a solo career. She began writing her own songs while honing a style of dress and grooming that, like her music, cuts against the grain. The look of current R&amp;B, like that of its cousin hip-hop, is high-priced designer labels and garishly chunky diamond jewelry. ''I like more of the thrift-store look,'' Kina said. ''I'm not into the whole designer thing -- you see everybody doing it. I'd rather take a cheap second-hand skirt, a cheap shirt and accessorize it right.''</p>
        <p>Her striking looks help her make such antistyle statements glamorous and have also earned her a modeling contract. ''Yeah, I'm a Wilhelmina model -- that sounds so weird,'' she said, laughing. ''I can't see myself doing runway, but it would be cool to do some ads.''</p>
        <p>Kina's brand of genre-hopping isn't without risk. For every Macy Gray, whose quirky voice and work-boots-and-overcoat look managed to cross over to a mainstream audience, there is a Dionne Farris, formerly of Arrested Development, who released a critically acclaimed solo album only to be dropped by her record label when sales were slow. Black rockers like Living Color and Lenny Kravitz had to fight hard to find a niche within the racially pigeonholed music industry. Vernon Reid, the lead guitarist of Living Color, often bemoaned how rock, created by black artists in the 50's, has come to be seen as music that's odd for African-Americans to play.</p>
        <p>''A few companies heard my demo and loved it,'' Kina said. ''But they were from the urban department and didn't know what to do with it. They couldn't hear it being played on black radio. I got signed by the pop department at Dreamworks.''</p>
        <p>At most of her concerts, the crowds are racially mixed, mirroring the makeup of her band: black drummer and bass player and two white guitarists. ''It's really interesting, because I go to places like Atlanta, where most of my audience is black, but I get no love from black  radio,'' Kina said. ''I've been picked up mostly by Top 40. I would like to be played on black radio.''</p>
        <p>In the United States, most radio formats are tightly segregated, and there is often a tacit color line behind the programming decisions. A rock station like WXRK in New York will play hip-hop records by white artists like Eminem and the Beastie Boys, but never by black rappers like Busta Rhymes or Jay-Z. And black-oriented stations like WBLS rarely play the rock songs of African-American artists like Mr. Kravitz.</p>
        <p>The emergence of artists like Kina and Macy Gray is evidence that musical divisions can be broken down, but not without prodding, and a few awkward moments.</p>
        <p>''At our show in Philly the other night,'' Kina said, ''the crowd was split about 50-50, black and white, and it was quite interesting to see how separate it was. The black people all rushed to the front of the stage; the white people stayed more to the back dancing. If I could've found a way to bring everybody in, I would have, but I couldn't.''</p>
        <p>Then she added, smiling, ''But I honestly think the more people start getting exposed to different sounds, the more those barriers are going to break down.''</p>
