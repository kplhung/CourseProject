        <p>After mother's milk, the three greatest cuisines in the world are French, Chinese and Junque. (I have a special unpublished hot line for chauvinists from Italy, Japan and Myanmar who think otherwise.) We are a nation dedicated to novelty, and thus chaotic fusionists, vertical foodites and Those Who Would Put Mangoes on Beefsteak currently overrun our trendier eating establishments. Classic French food, once dismissed for its fussiness and barbell content, now seems simple and authoritative by comparison. Recent French food seems even more so.</p>
        <p>Bugs Bunny once paraphrased Oscar Wilde: ''Paris is where good Americans get to go when they die.'' And when you hit it right -- usually at the beginning of spring, the song don't lie -- Paris can indeed be Bugs's paradise, and the possibility of his theology proving accurate quickens the nervous system.</p>
        <p>When I was there in May, flowers -- about which I know nothing except that they're pretty, and if Stravinsky is any judge, really tough -- were everywhere. The town was positively ikebanic. Its inhabitants, giddy with the weather, were shockingly polite; the exchange rate was so favorable that the city's Expensive rating could be downgraded from the Insane to the merely Staggering, and the three-asparagus soup from the restaurant Rue Balzac was the happiest welcome to any world capital since Cleopatra opened up her gates to Caesar.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the bistros and brasseries are not quite the relative bargain the rest of the city is. It's not just the bracing invisible surcharge -19.6 percent VAT, 15 percent gratuity. Oh, no, there's more.</p>
        <p>Bugs could not have had politics in mind when he equated this place with Nirvana. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin decided that he could create jobs if no person in France working for a company with more than 20 employees toiled in excess of 35 hours a week. This in itself wasn't all that radical -- since 1981, the French have been, on paper, restricted to working a 39-hour week. What is radical is that Jospin, dunce cap askew and apparently unaware that there is a French word for productivity -- productivite -- has chosen to enforce it. Battalions of humorless little meddlers with briefcases and green eye shades now swarm over company books with that festive compulsiveness so beloved of socialists, checking how many hours employees work and generally taking the fun out of life.</p>
        <p>Now, I know less about economics than I do about flowers, but I know a restaurateur foaming at the mouth when I see one. Owners are livid, and so are their staffs. No more 50-70-hour weeks; no more overtime; no lowering of salaries -but no raising of them. The unions are thrilled, of course, since their membership and power, at least in theory, have doubled overnight.</p>
        <p>This most recent attempt -- about the 83rd since the Revolution -- by the government to destroy its own country bears out the old adage that politically, a Frenchman is born with three feet -- two to walk with and one to shoot himself in. But the French cling patriotically to their contrariness, buoyed no doubt by their recent defiance of all Western, Eastern and alternative medicine in being the one country that can laugh at heart disease as its people ingurgitate the red wine, triple-cr me cheeses and foie gras that kill everyone else. And true to character, while the rest of the Western world works its collective fanny off, reaping the benefits of unprecedented economic largess, France chooses to work less.</p>
        <p>This is particularly troubling to the feeding business, which simply can't afford to pay two people for the job one person did just five minutes ago. Many of the larger establishments thought the government must be kidding, and some have paid the price. Although the extremely luxe Plaza Athenee Hotel claims it closed its elegant two- star La Regence until September for renovations in honor of new chef, Alain Ducasse, word has it they may have been forced to because, according to government rules, its employees were working too hard.</p>
        <p>Tirade over, could we move on to the food, please? Well, O.K., except for one more, how you say, eccentricite. Owners have never liked the VAT. But the government placed its thick finger further up the collective restaurant nostril by decreeing that takeout establishments need pay only 5.5 percent. This has the curious effect not only of subsidizing fast food at the expense of its better, but also of subsidizing American takeout, since McDonald's and other American culinary dumbers-down are omnipresent.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the rancor of the owners and chefs hasn't reached the palates of the diners (though if I shined Jospin's political shoes, I'd sure hire a taster). The bookkeeper trolls have allowed the Plaza Athenee's other room, the graceful Grill Relais Plaza, to remain open, and Chef Philippe Marc regularly turns out surprising and exceptional fare.</p>
        <p>And at Rue Balzac, a delightful newcomer whose principal owners include the restaurentrepreneur Michel Rostang and the French Elvis, Johnny Hallyday, the dishes sparkle with inventiveness and simplicity. They are also a visual delight; many are artfully (but simply) arranged on rectangular green glass plates, only slightly larger than the food, making for a cheery, unpretentious presentation. Rue Balzac opened its doors in February, and unlike most eateries keeps them open seven days. With the young chef, Yann Roncier, wearing the white hat, there is much originality here, particularly the delightful asparagus soups, two hot, one cold -- and the pineapples Victoria, which had never before passed these lips.</p>
        <p>I found everything pleasurable. (Well, except for the turbot. I've never had anything but dry, tough turbot when it's grilled; poached, it's voluptuous. But be encouraged to order anything else.)</p>
        <p>And so Bugs and I have chosen to ignore current governmental schizophrenia to focus on the food, the flowers and the new gentility, bravely, if idealistically, believing that should we Americans be judged good enough to make it to this heaven, the two most certain things in life will be of the past.</p>
        <p>Three Little Asparagus Soups For Spring  (Adapted from Rue Balzac)</p>
        <p>The most daunting aspect of serving three asparagus soups is finding 18 little bowls. But unless you're having Nathan Lane to dinner, who cares if they match? Coffee cups, old-fashioned glasses, mugs, pairs of cupped hands -- all are fine.</p>
        <p>2 pounds asparagus, ends trimmed  6 tablespoons butter  4 cups chicken broth  2 pints half-and-half  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 medium onion, chopped  1 cup Arborio rice  2 cups water</p>
        <p>1/4 cup all-purpose flour  1egg, beaten</p>
        <p>1/2 cup bread crumbs  Vegetable oil for deep frying  3 ounces raw salmon fillet, skinned, cut into  1/4-inch dice</p>
        <p>1. Peel 4 asparagus stalks and slice the remainder crosswise into 1-inch pieces. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and add the sliced asparagus and 2 of the peeled stalks. Saute 5 minutes or until soft.</p>
        <p>2. Add chicken broth, bring to a boil and add half-and-half. Simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the 2 stalks. Continue to simmer for 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <p>3. Pour the soup through a coarse sieve set over a large bowl, pressing the asparagus through with the back of a large spoon. Scrape the pulp into the soup, whisk and refrigerate 1/3 of it.</p>
        <p>4. Cut the 2 cooked asparagus stalks into  1/4-inch dice. Set aside. Slice the 2 raw asparagus stalks into 1 1/2- by- 1/8-inch julienne. Set aside.</p>
        <p>5. For a risotto quenelle garnish, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and saute the onion until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the rice and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the water, 1/3 cup at a time, adding more as water is absorbed, cooking risotto about 10 minutes in all. Add the diced asparagus and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until rice is al dente. Spread risotto on a plate to cool.</p>
        <p>6. Place the flour, egg and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. Shape the rice into quenelles (small footballs) with 2 teaspoons, lightly roll in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumbs.</p>
        <p>7. Heat 2 inches of vegetable oil in a small pot to 375 degrees and fry the risotto quenelles until brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.</p>
        <p>8. To serve, remove the cold soup from the refrigerator and remove any solidified butter to larger portion of soup. Heat the unrefrigerated soup till hot and pour into 12 small bowls, adding the reserved asparagus strands to 6 and the quenelles to 6. Pour the cold soup into 6 small bowls, adding the chopped raw salmon to each. Serve each diner with 3 different soups.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Pineapples Victoria</p>
        <p>This creme brulee is much easier to make than most, and because it is poured over the top of the pineapple, it is more forgiving.</p>
        <p>Creme brulee simple:  2 pints heavy cream  Beans scraped from 2 vanilla pods  10 large eggs</p>
        <p>1/2 cup granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup soft light brown sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</p>
        <p>Pineapple:  3 gorgeous small pineapples  4 tablespoons butter  1/3 cup honey  1/3 cup light rum.</p>
        <p>1. The day before serving, make the creme brulee by preheating the oven to 325 degrees and bringing the cream and vanilla seeds to a simmer. Whisk eggs and granulated sugar until blended. Add the hot cream in a steady stream, whisking the egg mixture constantly. Pour into a 2-quart souffle dish set in a roasting pan of hot water that comes  1/4 up the side and bake about 45 minutes -- the custard should be firm but not set. Cool to room temperature and refrigerate.</p>
        <p>2. Cut pineapple in half lengthwise, scoop out flesh and chop it into bite-size pieces.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat the broiler. Melt the butter, stir in the honey and add the pineapple and its juice. Saute until liquid evaporates. Add rum, warm it and set it on fire. Divide the mixture among the 6 pineapple shells, cover each with cold cr me brlee and sprinkle with the sugars. Broil until the sugars are caramelized, watching carefully.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
