        <p>CORPORATE boards aren't what they used to be.</p>
        <p>The average length of tenure is dropping and turnover is rising. More seats are going to outside directors. Chief executives are joining fewer boards, the better to focus attention on the ones they choose.</p>
        <p>This evolution, over the last decade, has made boards better at dispensing tough, objective advice, governance experts say, and may even be playing a role in American companies' current run of success.</p>
        <p>But the changes also mean that there are  many more opportunities than before to become a director for the first time -- if you can catch the eye of a recruiter or a nominating committee.</p>
        <p>''In the past, boards mainly found new members through their existing members,'' said Peter D. Crist, the vice chairman of Korn/Ferry International, the executive search firm, who spends about half his time filling directorships. ''We've tended to move away from that model, although it certainly still occurs.''</p>
        <p>Still, the competition is tough. The valuable career-building experience of serving on a board, not to mention the prestige, stock options and other perquisites that come with a director's seat, attract many more interested people than there are openings.</p>
        <p>Experts say executives can take a number of specific steps to improve their chances. Some are obvious -- like adding  overseas experience or a successfully executed Internet strategy to a resume. Others are more subtle.</p>
        <p>Following are some strategies that management experts suggest for getting your name among the most promising candidates.</p>
        <p>SET THE STAGE -- Most companies, and virtually all large ones, want their directors to have experience running something big -- a company, a division, a business unit -- of their own. Executives do not usually reach this level, generally executive vice president or chief financial officer, until their 40's or later. But recruiters say up-and-comers in their 30's can take steps now to help themselves in the future.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Ilene S. Gordon, then in her late 30's, was a rising executive in Chicago. She had put in some time at Boston Consulting Group, but most of her experience was in the packaging industry. ''I wanted to get on a board to be exposed to broader issues,'' Ms. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>So she did what she could to get noticed. She joined the Economic Club of Chicago and volunteered for the membership committee, allowing her to meet many local executives. She also signed up with two networking groups for women and, later, became a director of a hospital in Evanston, Ill.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Gordon serves on two corporate boards -- at A. J. Gallagher and United Stationers -- and has completed terms at three others.</p>
        <p>Executives recruiters say her approach -- working hard to meet people outside her company and joining the board of a nonprofit organization -- are among the most effective strategies for aspiring directors.</p>
        <p>Nonprofit groups are often eager for advice, and may be more willing than a corporation to name a younger manager who is enthusiastic about the group's mission. A stint on a nonprofit's board yields a sense of  how boards function in general and a chance to meet other director-level executives.</p>
        <p>PUT YOUR NETWORK TO WORK -- The chief executive of almost every big company in the country receives stacks of board invitations but turns most of them down. But a growing number of bosses take advantage of the requests to refer their lieutenants for board seats.</p>
        <p>Some are even more proactive. John Hawkins, a recruiter at Russell Reynolds, a search firm, says he has received calls in recent months from three chairmen, asking him to meet with high-ranking executives at their companies and size them up for directorships.</p>
        <p>More than friendship is involved: the chairmen hope that their proteges will learn from executives at other companies and become stronger potential chief executives, Mr. Hawkins said.</p>
        <p>The message for aspiring board members is clear: If the chance presents itself, tell your boss that you think that joining an outside board could make you more effective at your own job. Few bosses are likely to be put off by this, because most were once in the same position. ''I felt it was important, to prepare myself to be C.E.O., to have the experience of being on an outside board,'' said Sidney Taurel, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, who is now on the boards of ITT and McGraw-Hill.</p>
        <p>It also makes sense to let an executive recruiter know about your interest. But an unsolicited letter is not usually the most effective strategy, recruiters say. ''I get letters every day, and I read them,'' Mr. Crist said. ''But clearly, as you can imagine, if someone is introduced to me by a friend or someone I respect, I'm going to pay attention to that.''</p>
        <p>Karen Osar was the treasurer of Tenneco in 1997 when, during a performance review, the chief financial officer told her that joining a board would be an important way to broaden her experience, she said. Ms. Osar then called a recruiter she knew and expressed her interest. The recruiter set up a breakfast for her in New York with a colleague of his who specializes in board searches -- Mr. Hawkins. Within a year, Mr. Hawkins had connected her with Allergan, the pharmaceuticals company, which made her a director. Ms. Osar is now the chief financial officer of Westvaco, a packaging company.</p>
        <p>SEE FIRSTHAND, AND BE SEEN -- One of the best ways for executives to learn how boards work -- and, in turn, to become attractive candidates -- is to get in front of the board at their own companies, recruiters say.</p>
        <p>''C.E.O.'s want to know that whoever's coming on their board understands the dynamic,'' said Andrea Reynolds, a managing director at Russell Reynolds. That means leaping at any assignment that might result in a presentation to directors.</p>
        <p>If all goes well, the experience may lead to an invitation to join another board -- on which one of your own company's directors already serves. At the least, the experience adds an important credential to a dossier, recruiters said.</p>
        <p>But nothing beats actually serving on a board, and management experts say small companies can provide the ideal initial directorship for many executives. ''At some point, you have to do your starter-upper board,'' Mr. Crist said.</p>
        <p>Such a board, he said, lets a new director  have an immediate effect by providing a perspective not previously represented.</p>
        <p>KNOW WHAT YOU WANT -- Once elected to a first board, an executive should forswear other board assignments for a few years, recruiters said.</p>
        <p>Being a productive director typically requires more than 150 hours a year, on top of one's day job. New directors should devote their energy exclusively to the first company that trusts them with a director's chair (unless lightning strikes and Ford or Coca-Cola calls).</p>
        <p>When Judith A. Sprieser became the chief financial officer of Sara Lee six years ago, she was already on the board of a much smaller manufacturing company. Her promotion led to a flood of new board offers, she said, but she turned them down, choosing to focus on her new job and to wait for an invitation from a company that was similar in size.</p>
        <p>''It was hard, because there were a lot of very, very interesting companies,'' said Ms. Sprieser, who last week became the chief executive of Transora.com, a business-to-business exchange for the food industry. But the forbearance paid off last year, she said, when she received an offer to serve on the board of Allstate -- which brings in more revenue than Sara Lee and is also based in Chicago, minimizing the travel time away from her family.</p>
        <p>DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE BASICS -- Executives can increase their odds of board selection in many ways, but recruiters say the most important is also the most obvious:  ''The best way to get on a board is to do your job,'' said Ted Jadick, a managing partner in the board practice of Heidrick &amp; Struggles in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crist added: ''Just do exactly what you're paid to do exceedingly well. You will be found. I guarantee it.''</p>
        <p>A sense of serenity can help, too. The selection process for almost any board is complex and carefully calibrated, having as much to do with the group's current makeup as with the credentials of the candidates.</p>
        <p>''One of the keys here is, be patient,'' Mr. Hawkins said. An executive may rise to president or chief financial officer of his company, he added, but his selection to an outside board ''may not happen even in the first year.''</p>
        <p>''It's very quirky,'' he said.</p>
