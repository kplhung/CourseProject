        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens will always be associated with the 92-mile-an-hour fastball that gave Mike Piazza a concussion. A lifetime of sterling performance and dedication has been erased with one pitch. If one is coldly calculating enough to brush back an opponent who has shown him up once too often, one must be cool enough to calculate the possible trajectories of the ball.</p>
        <p>George Steinbrenner's defense that the Mets wanted only to take the focus off the fact that they were losing the series with the Yankees only confirms his pomposity.</p>
