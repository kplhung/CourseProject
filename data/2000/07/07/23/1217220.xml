        <p>In her first public appearance before a Jewish audience since she was accused of making an anti-Semitic slur, Hillary Rodham Clinton attended Saturday services at a synagogue here today and received a generally warm welcome.</p>
        <p>Shortly after 9 a.m., as services at the Hampton Synagogue got under way, Mrs. Clinton strolled in and a group of women burst into applause.</p>
        <p>A few of the men said ''Shh!'' -- invoking a tradition against applause in a synagogue -- and went back to their prayers. Mrs. Clinton sat in the front of the women's section -- separate from the men's section, as is the custom in Orthodox synagogues. A few minutes later, Rabbi Marc Schneier, the founder of the synagogue, addressed Mrs. Clinton, saying, ''I know this has been a very difficult and very trying week for you, and it's time for us to move on.''</p>
        <p>During her remarks to about 1,000 worshipers, Mrs. Clinton did not directly mention the accusation, which came out last week after a former reporter for The National Enquirer published a book in which a former campaign manager for President Clinton said Mrs. Clinton used an anti-Semitic slur to refer to him in 1974. She has vehemently denied the assertion. But she often referred during her 30-minute talk today to the importance of racial and ethnic ''understanding.''</p>
        <p>''I am worried today about the increasing and continuous level of hatred and hate crimes, prejudice and bigotry in our communities,'' she said. ''I think all of us know how important it is to stand against it whenever it raises its ugly head.''</p>
        <p>Since declaring her candidacy for the Senate, Mrs. Clinton has made a concerted effort to reach out to Jewish voters, whose support for her has been rocky. She has angered some Jewish leaders by saying she supports the creation of a Palestinian state, and she came under fire last year when, during a visit to the West Bank, she remained silent as the wife of Yasir Arafat hurled accusations at the Israeli government over its treatment of Arabs.</p>
        <p>But then, after entering the Senate race, she broke with the Clinton administration's policy and said Jerusalem should be ''the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''</p>
        <p>Today, she made no mention of Jerusalem and spoke only in vague terms about the Middle East peace talks, between delegations representing Mr. Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister. ''I know on many of our minds today is what's going on at Camp David,'' she said. ''So much of the challenge the president and the prime minister are facing is rooted in whether or not others will give up their hatred and their sense of violence and their commitment to destruction, in return for peace.''</p>
        <p>During her remarks, Mrs. Clinton drew on lessons from the Torah, saying Israelis are asking for ''the inheritance that is their just due, a chance to keep their children safe from violence and terrorism.''</p>
        <p>She told reporters after the services that she had been referring to the Torah reading at the synagogue.</p>
        <p>''Children and inheritance are two of the themes that run through the Bible,'' she said. ''And we can see that in action today, and we think about the needs that the children in our own country and the inheritance that we should be providing for them -- good education and good health --  and the inheritance of the children of Israel deserve to have, which is to live in security and peace.''</p>
        <p>Some of the worshipers said they were disappointed that Mrs. Clinton had not gone into more detail about the status of the Middle East talks, which are under way in Maryland, or more clearly defined her vision for bringing stability to the region.</p>
        <p>''She took no stand, other than very surface stuff,'' said Richard Haar of Manhattan, who spends summers in Westhampton and regularly attends the synagogue. ''She really wasn't saying anything, and she had a tremendous opportunity here.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton appeared to garner some support among worshipers who said they had been ambivalent about her before today's visit.</p>
        <p>Alice Barbanel, a regular member, said the visit helped ''dispel a lot of myths that are going around, negative stuff,'' including ''her attitude toward Israel, anti-Semitism. I think it gave us an opportunity to see her as a human being and where she's coming from.''</p>
        <p>Some also said they thought her appearance at an Orthodox synagogue so soon after the slur accusation surfaced was bold.</p>
        <p>''It was a very brave and classy thing to do,'' said Merna Tarnower.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's appearance was planned before the accusation surfaced, and she was scheduled to attend fund-raising events in the area later today, campaign officials said.</p>
