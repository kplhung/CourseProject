        <p>WHEN President Clinton announced last month at a White House ceremony that scientists had effectively mapped the human genetic code, the man who was arguably most responsible for the achievement was not in the room. The man, Michael W. Hunkapiller, was home with chicken pox.</p>
        <p>He didn't mind too much, though. He has never sought the limelight.</p>
        <p>Yet it was his company, PE Biosystems, that designed the high-speed DNA sequencers used to unravel the human genome. And it was Dr. Hunkapiller, along with his boss, Tony L. White of the PE Corporation, the parent company, who thought to set up Celera Genomics and have it use 300 of the new machines to sequence the genome years ahead of the publicly financed Human Genome Project.</p>
        <p>The public project responded by stepping up its own pace and buying about 200 of PE's machines. Dr. Hunkapiller, in short, had set off an arms race in which he was the arms merchant. And while Celera and its outspoken president, J. Craig Venter, got the attention and a spot on the dais with President Clinton, PE Biosystems and the quiet Dr. Hunkapiller made the money.</p>
        <p>Much as Cisco Systems did with the Internet, PE Biosystems -- which is changing its name back to Applied Biosystems -- has emerged as by far the leading supplier of equipment to the exploding genomics industry.</p>
        <p>The company -- like Celera, a subsidiary of the PE Corporation with its own tracking stock -- controls at least two-thirds of the market for gene sequencers. It is also the leading supplier of equipment used for one of the fundamental processes in biotechnology, the amplification and detection of DNA by polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. And it is in the early lead for machines used to analyze proteins, a field known as proteomics. That field is expected to be the next big thing after genomics, because it will help researchers better understand what all those genes, which guide the body's production of proteins, actually do.</p>
        <p>''There used to be a saying in the computer business that no one ever got fired for buying I.B.M.,'' said Lawrence S. Schmid, president of Strategic Directions International, a market research company in Los Angeles that tracks the analytical instrument industry. ''The same is true with PE.''</p>
        <p>INDEED, customers and competitors often refer to PE as the Microsoft of genomics equipment, not only because of its commanding position but also for what they see as its aggressive tactics. And if PE is the Microsoft, then Dr. Hunkapiller, whose doctorate is in chemical biology from the California Institute of Technology, is the Bill  Gates, a man most comfortable discussing the intricacies of technology but able to transform himself into a respected, shrewd and tough businessman.</p>
        <p>Customers say, only half-jokingly, that when the company operated as Applied Biosystems Inc., the initials A.B.I. stamped on its machines stood for ''arrogance beyond imagination.'' Rivals say the company uses its powerful patent portfolio and frequent lawsuits as cudgels to stave off competition or to force others to license technology it needs.</p>
        <p>And some critics say that until it introduced its powerful Model 3700 sequencers two years ago, the company, facing little competition, had kept its prices high and improved its machines only slowly.</p>
        <p>''I think the genome project could have gone ahead faster if they had made the capabilities of the system available sooner,'' said Clark Tibbetts, a scientist at Virginia Tech. Several years ago, while at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Tibbetts took matters into his own hands by modifying a sequencer to quadruple its speed.</p>
        <p>Any company being compared to Microsoft has to be aware of antitrust concerns.</p>
        <p>PE recently dropped plans to acquire a smaller company, Third Wave Technologies, saying the Justice Department's antitrust review was taking too long. In 1998, PE had to divest some patent rights to clear another acquisition. The Justice Department would not comment. And after PE sued two of its largest competitors, contending patent infringement, those rivals countersued, contending antitrust violations.</p>
        <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, is investigating whether federal funds were used in the invention of the first automated DNA sequencer at Caltech in the 1980's. If federal funds were used, PE might have to give the government a discount on gene sequencers or share the patents more widely. Federal officials are also looking at whether someone other than those listed on the patent might have invented the machine. If so, the patent could be invalidated.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunkapiller, 51, one of the inventors at Caltech, said the invention issues had already been examined by Caltech and by various patent offices. He said the Justice Department had told his company that it was not under investigation. And both he and Caltech said that while the university received some federal financing, it was not until the sequencer had already been invented.</p>
        <p>In any case, he said, PE already gives the government a discount and licenses its technology to others.</p>
        <p>''Despite that, we have very strong market shares,'' he said. ''We don't apologize for that.''</p>
        <p>He said the federal investigations had been stirred up by people who resented Celera's competing with the public genome project or by companies sued by PE. ''There are people out there who don't like paying licenses for technology they do not own,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SECURITIES analysts dismiss the Caltech issue. Virtually all those who follow PE recommend its shares, agreeing with company projections that it will be able to maintain the 20 percent annual revenue growth it has recorded since 1993. Profits are also expected to grow at that pace.</p>
        <p>''PE Bio is the best of breed,'' said Winton Gibbons, an analyst at William Blair &amp; Company in Chicago. The company's stock is up 176 percent over the last 12 months, though it is down by almost half from its peak in March, to $81.</p>
        <p>Still, the going could get tougher, now that the mapping of the genome is nearly finished. PE sold 1,100 new Model 3700 sequencers at $300,000 apiece in a single year, adding about $300 million to revenues. Now the arms race seems likely to subside.</p>
        <p>''The real game is not more sequencing,'' said Michael McKenna, vice president for operations at the CuraGen Corporation, a genomics-based drug development company. ''The real game is seeing which genes are drug targets. It's a completely different set of tools.''</p>
        <p>PE officials say sequencers will still be needed for the genomes of other organisms, for DNA fingerprinting in forensics and for finding differences among human genes that can help diagnose diseases. Moreover, each Model 3700 automated sequencer uses as much as $100,000 of chemicals a year, providing a continuing income stream. While PE will not be able to keep selling 1,000 high-end machines a year, it expects its overall sequencing business to keep growing.</p>
        <p>Analysts say sequencers account for 40 to 45 percent of PE's revenue, which is expected to total about $1.4 billion for the fiscal year that ended in June. Parts of the polymerase chain reaction business are growing even faster, said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with SG Cowen. And Celera, which raised $1 billion in a March stock offering, plans to spend a big chunk of it on proteomics equipment being developed by PE Biosystems.</p>
        <p>Still, PE is not likely to be as dominant in proteomics. And technology is evolving rapidly: start-up companies have developed chips as small as postage stamps that can analyze thousands of genes at a time or perform complex chemical analyses. Such chips could undermine PE's bigger instruments, just as personal computers undermined I.B.M.'s mainframes and the Internet threatens Microsoft's dominance.</p>
        <p>So PE, which is behind in developing such chips, has entered into more than 20 alliances with companies ranging from 3M to start-ups like Illumina and Aclara BioSciences.</p>
        <p>''It's critical for our growth that the start-ups, the new ideas, come to us first,'' said Michael Albin, vice president for science and technology.</p>
        <p>Indeed, PE has long been adept at licensing technology from others. Even the powerful new sequencers used in the genome project were developed in good measure by Hitachi. PE's sales force and financial strength make the company an attractive partner, and it excels in the combination of chemistry, biology, engineering and software needed to turn raw ideas into usable products.</p>
        <p>Applied Biosystems was founded by venture capitalists in 1981 to commercialize technology from the laboratory of Leroy Hood, then a Caltech professor and a pioneer in the automation of genomics. Two Hewlett-Packard executives, Sam H. Eletr and Andre Marion, were recruited to run the company, and they in turn recruited Dr. Hunkapiller, Dr. Hood's right-hand man. Starting in research and development, Dr. Hunkapiller rose to head of the company in 1995. ''Mike has really given the vision to the company,'' said Mr. Marion, who retired in 1995.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunkapiller is a man of few words, rarely shooting from the hip or showing his emotions. But while outsiders can be put off by his bluntness, his engineers seem to idolize him for his lack of airs and the creative atmosphere he has fostered at the company's sprawling campus here, next to San Francisco Bay.</p>
        <p>''Mike is in a cubicle at the end of the hall,'' Dr. Albin said. ''If you want to walk up to Mike, you walk up to Mike.''</p>
        <p>Despite his terseness, Dr. Hunkapiller was a star debater in his high school in Seminole, Okla., having been coached by another debater from the school, David L. Boren, who later became a United States senator and governor. And that skill shows up in negotiations.</p>
        <p>''If he believes in something, he'll argue it, argue it,'' said John H. Richards, a close friend who was Dr. Hunkapiller's thesis adviser at Caltech. ''He doesn't give up.''</p>
        <p>Not that Dr. Hunkapiller is all work and no play. In fact, he plays soccer at lunchtime nearly every day. He is a ''Star Trek'' fanatic who owns videos of every television episode and movie. And he is a fervent Dallas Cowboys fan who was thrilled when his company arranged to have the former quarterback Roger Staubach, whom he had never met, deliver a videotaped greeting for his 50th birthday.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Oklahoma Baptist University, Dr. Hunkapiller went on to get his doctorate at Caltech and then moved to Dr. Hood's lab.</p>
        <p>It was there that Dr. Hunkapiller and others, including his younger brother, Tim, made the key invention of attaching different colors of fluorescent dyes to the four different chemical units in the genetic code, allowing the sequence to be read by machine.</p>
        <p>From the start, Applied Biosystems outran or outlasted bigger competitors like DuPont, EG&amp;G and Beckman Coulter.</p>
        <p>The company has been helped by its control of the key Caltech patents. Normally, a company would not be obligated to license patents to anyone. But the agreement with Caltech requires PE to license the DNA sequencer patents to others on reasonable terms. Dr. Hunkapiller said the company has abided by this but added, ''reasonable, from our perspective, doesn't mean free.''</p>
        <p>Rivals say PE drives a hard bargain and plays its patent hand brilliantly. Hitachi, the Japanese electronics giant, could not come to terms on a license. ''There were many attempts to license it and cross-license it throughout the years,'' said Mark McDonald, president of Hitachi Instruments.</p>
        <p>But by 1997 or so, a huge threat was developing. A Silicon Valley start-up called Molecular Dynamics was developing a high-capacity sequencer called the MegaBace that could run rings around anything PE offered at the time. Molecular Dynamics found PE's asking price for a patent license prohibitive. But Molecular linked up with -- and was eventually acquired by -- a company called Amersham Pharmacia Biotech that had wrestled a patent license from PE in exchange for giving PE rights to a key enzyme used in the sequencers.</p>
        <p>Faced with the MegaBace threat, PE turned to Hitachi for the technology to build its own high-capacity machine, the 3700.</p>
        <p>But the MegaBace beat the Model 3700 to market by months. Amersham's first big customer was Incyte Pharmaceuticals, a genomics company that had grown impatient with what it saw as PE's slowness in introducing new technology. Some customers say the MegaBace, which cost less, is more flexible and reliable than the 3700.</p>
        <p>''We have struggled extensively with the reliability'' of the 3700, said Elaine R. Mardis, assistant director of the genome sequencing center at Washington University in St. Louis, which has machines from both makers. Dr. Mardis said she had to fly to California with records of machine's downtime to get PE to provide more service technicians. ''It's not 'The customer is always right,' '' she said of PE's attitude. ''The customer is always wrong.''</p>
        <p>Susan Eddins, product manager for the Model 3700, said early service problems arose because the company had been overwhelmed by orders. ''When this thing first came out, it was really insane,'' she said. ''We took our service guys to the limit.'' Service, she said, has improved since then.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eddins also said the company's reputation for arrogance was unjustified and arose because customers expected customized machines, which PE could not reasonably provide.</p>
        <p>''They don't understand that we put out 5,000 boxes a week,'' she said.</p>
        <p>DESPITE Amersham's lead in getting the MegaBace to market, PE's 3700 could work with less pure samples of DNA and was more automated, able to run all day and night without human intervention.</p>
        <p>It thus became the machine of choice for the 24-hour-a-day DNA crunching at Washington University and at three of the other four centers that did most of the public Human Genome Project, even though many of its scientists would have preferred not to buy from the company that financed Celera.</p>
        <p>Still, Amersham Pharmacia, a joint venture of Nycomed Amersham of Britain and Pharmacia, the drug company, has provided the most significant competition to PE in years. It sold 288 MegaBace machines last year, giving it about 20 percent of the high-end market -- more if Celera's 300 machines were excluded from PE's sales of 1,100 machines. One of the five centers of the Human Genome Project, as well as companies like CuraGen and Incyte, now called Incyte Genomics, uses Amersham's machines exclusively.</p>
        <p>Amersham and PE are locked in a nasty patent lawsuit over technology, although in this case it was prompted by Amersham withholding a license from PE.</p>
        <p>PE is also in a battle with MJ Research of Waltham, Mass., the leading competitor in equipment used to prepare DNA for the sequencing machines, which is often done by using the polymerase process. PE wants all makers of machines to buy a P.C.R. license. But MJ has refused, saying its machines can be used for other processes. It is countersuing on antitrust grounds.</p>
        <p>Just this month, PE filed a patent infringement suit against Affymetrix, the leader in gene chips.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Hunkapiller has been with Applied Biosystems nearly from the start, the company's transformation to a powerhouse was completed by Mr. White, the head of the parent company.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Applied Biosystems was acquired by Perkin-Elmer, the old-line scientific instrument company in Norwalk, Conn., that had rights to the polymerase technology. Mr. White took over as chief executive at Perkin-Elmer in 1995 and focused the company on life sciences. Last year, he sold off the mainstay but stagnant analytical chemistry business to EG&amp;G, which then renamed itself PerkinElmer Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. White's company, meanwhile,  became the PE Corporation, with no stock of its own but two divisions with tracking stocks -- PE Biosystems and Celera. Now, because of confusion with PerkinElmer, PE Biosystems is changing its name back to Applied Biosystems, pending shareholder approval this fall. The PE Corporation is contemplating a name change, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said that one reason for setting up Celera, which sells genomic information, was concern that the instrument business might be ''marginalized'' in the long run, with the real money being made in using the instruments to study genes or to make drugs.</p>
        <p>But the move is risky in that PE Biosystems, through Celera, is now competing with its own customers. Company officials say Celera was not favored in shipments or service.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. White talks about Celera, which is based in Rockville, Md., having ''first mover advantage,'' because it gets to look at the machines while they are still in development. PE expects to benefit as well, using genetic information from Celera to design genetic test kits.</p>
        <p>So far, though, rather than hurting sales to other customers, the formation of Celera has spurred them. ''It woke up the industry,'' Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunkapiller said he did not necessarily think that Celera's formation would provoke the public genome project into buying so many PE machines. ''We certainly didn't get into it with that intention,'' he said. ''It just happened.''</p>
        <p>SOME people at PE Biosystems say the company in general, and Dr. Hunkapiller in particular, should have received more recognition at the White House ceremony. Dr. Hunkapiller said he felt bad for his employees but not for himself.</p>
        <p>The positive side to his being ill was that his daughter, Kathryn, a biologist who works for Celera, got to go in his stead.</p>
        <p>''He just doesn't care,'' his brother Tim said. ''Maybe deep down there's some little twinge. But he doesn't express it.''</p>
