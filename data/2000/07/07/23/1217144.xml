        <p>TIME was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not anymore.

        <p>Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &amp; B compact disk, ''Konishiki KMS'' -- short for ''Konishiki Master Sumo'' -- has just been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a 16-year career in Japan.</p>

        <p>TIME was when a professional athlete who wanted a second career would become a sports commentator, an actor or a restaurateur. Not anymore. Today, the path off the playing field is leading increasingly into the recording studio. Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers, his teammate Kobe Bryant and Ricky Watters of the Seattle Seahawks have all recently made rap albums.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most extreme example of this crossover is the former sumo wrestler Konishiki, whose debut rap/reggae/R &amp; B compact disk, ''Konishiki KMS'' -- short for ''Konishiki Master Sumo'' -- has just been released by 125th Street Records. Born as Salevaa Atisanoe in Hawaii to Samoan parents, Konishiki (pronounced co-NEESH-kee and meaning Delicate Embroidery) retired from the ring in 1998 after a 16-year career in Japan.</p>
        <p>Speaking of his new CD, he says, ''There are aspects of sumo like the concept of 'makenai-desu' -- an attitude of, 'I will not lose' -- which I've used in the ring.'' Indeed, the influence of sumo, which in its modern form dates to the 17th century, permeates the album in, well, unusual ways.</p>
        <p>THOMAS VINCIGUERRA</p>
        <p>In ''Takamiyama: The World of Sumo'' (Kodansha, 1973), the sumo wrestler Takamiyama stresses the high value of manners and courtesy:</p>
        <p>It would be hard to imagine a sumotori, no matter how strong and confident, bragging before a bout about how he was going to demolish his opponent the way Muhammad Ali might.</p>
        <p>But ''Livin' Like Kings,'' the first cut on Konishiki's album, betrays no false modesty:</p>
        <p>Make way for the Sumo,</p>
        <p>Comin' straight out [of] Samoa,</p>
        <p>Known to shake the ground</p>
        <p>When I first touch down. . . .</p>
        <p>Built to last like the Energizer Bunny;</p>
        <p>Pushin' 700 and still makin' money.</p>
        <p>Step into my Dojo, you're bound to get crowned,</p>
        <p>Thrown out the line or smashed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Competition? I'm the biggest, I ain't no rookie.</p>
        <p>Overweight lover and still known to boogie.</p>
        <p>Bring the house down when I hit the floor,</p>
        <p>And sing karaoke for an encore.</p>
        <p>Most people eat to live; sumo wrestlers live to eat, as the authors Andy Adams and Clyde Newton note in ''Sumo'' (Hamlyn, 1989):</p>
        <p>When it comes to eating and drinking, many sumo wrestlers could put to shame such famous gluttons as Diamond Jim Brady.</p>
        <p>Konishiki is down with that:</p>
        <p>Next on the menu is a seven-course meal;</p>
        <p>Sushi to start, raw tuna and eel.</p>
        <p>That's how we do it in the back of the club,</p>
        <p>Toast champagne as we get a back rub. . . .</p>
        <p>In the limelight, 'cause it's my turn,</p>
        <p>All the food I can eat, with the money to burn.</p>
        <p>According to Bill Gutman's ''Sumo Wrestling'' (Capstone, 1995), these are giants among men:</p>
        <p>His strength and size make the professional sumo wrestler almost impossible to move -- except by another sumo wrestler.</p>
        <p>In ''Settin' 'em Up,'' Konishiki elaborates:</p>
        <p>I'm solid, or do I need to go in detail?</p>
        <p>I rain like rock hail, my plan is not to fail.</p>
        <p>Sumo, step in the circle, step out the circle, fly out the circle,</p>
        <p>However you go, as long as you know,</p>
        <p>You're better off battlin' a bullet train</p>
        <p>Or pullin' your head off in a guillotine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutman says the risk of injury is minimal among seasoned sumo wrestlers, but Konishiki begs to differ in ''Settin' 'em Up'':</p>
        <p>You battle me, you're gonna need a nurse</p>
        <p>Fo' a broken back, a ruptured spleen, right arm fractured clean;</p>
        <p>I laugh -- it really don't mean jack to me. . . .</p>
        <p>Ha-ha-ha, stick 'em; ah-ah-ah hit 'em.</p>
        <p>Honey, smack 'em; hog-slap 'n' I slick 'em. . . .</p>
        <p>Don't be lookin' foul, you lose; you choose to</p>
        <p>Step in the diameter, I bruise you.</p>
        <p>In his memoir, Takamiyama describes an obligatory training exercise:</p>
        <p>Shiko, or stamping, involves raising each leg as high as possible and bringing it down on the dirt with great force.</p>
        <p>Konishiki's ''Sumo Stomp'' takes shiko to another level:</p>
        <p>I am, ah, the Sumo Stomper,</p>
        <p>The one you stomp.</p>
        <p>I put the stomp there on the chompy,</p>
        <p>Don't it sound funky?</p>
        <p>S-T-O-M-P-S-umo,</p>
        <p>Now, how ya like me?</p>
        <p>Cold like ice tea,</p>
        <p>Good like rice be,</p>
        <p>Do it like Nike!</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Sumo Stomp,</p>
        <p>It's enough to make the party jump.</p>
        <p>So if ya diggin' me, let me see your hands.</p>
        <p>Get on the floor, and let me see ya dance!</p>
        <p>Where do sumo wrestlers come from? Here's Doug Kenrick's answer in ''The Book of Sumo'' (Weatherhill, 1969):</p>
        <p>Sumotori are not a special breed; they are young Japanese men of greater than ordinary physical proportions who have been selected or have chosen to make the sport their living.</p>
        <p>But in ''Sumo Funk,'' Konishiki sees the hand of the Almighty at work:</p>
        <p>The ancient one, he said,</p>
        <p>'You're the chosen one, you see.'</p>
        <p>Brother, right then I knew</p>
        <p>I had the Sumo Funk in me.</p>
        <p>Although the wrestlers work hard, Mr. Adams and Mr. Newton explain, they don't get to play hard:</p>
        <p>The lower-ranked rikishi [wrestlers] have so many chores and other duties to take care of that they have very little time of their own. They must obtain permission from the stablemaster to go out, especially at night.</p>
        <p>No such drudgery awaits Konishiki in ''Another Day in Paradise'':</p>
        <p>Loungin' with my peeps and my cousins,</p>
        <p>Eatin' kiwi by the dozens.</p>
        <p>I didn't even go inside today</p>
        <p>'cause in the ocean's a-where I like to play,</p>
        <p>Sipping on Pina Coladas,</p>
        <p>Scoping out the fine-looking models . . .</p>
        <p>Day two, here's the plot:</p>
        <p>We can hit the spot</p>
        <p>Wit' the DJ mixin' on my yacht.</p>
        <p>Dancing all day on a 50-foot deck,</p>
        <p>Cruising on the ocean, getting soaking wet. . . .</p>
        <p>I got a coupe in the back, it's hooked up, it's real tight.</p>
        <p>Wit' the top down, let the beat pound,</p>
        <p>Wave hello to my fans, step out and just clown.</p>
        <p>Fun and games is an everyday thing,</p>
        <p>Party 'til dawn, or kick back and just hang.</p>
        <p>Finally, can a sumo wrestler find true love despite his bulk? A July 1997 National Geographic article thinks so:</p>
        <p>In counterpoint to their slightly built fellow countrymen, rikishi are fat, but -- with their intense exertions -- not necessarily unhealthy, and to many Japanese women they are most definitely not unattractive.</p>
        <p>Konishiki says as much -- and more -- in ''Toast the Night Away'':</p>
        <p>It's you and me all alone,</p>
        <p>On a rendezvous made for two.</p>
        <p>Loungin' in a suite on the Nile,</p>
        <p>Do anything, girl, just to see you smile.</p>
        <p>It's been a long time and the days have passed;</p>
        <p>I've been around the world since I seen you last.</p>
        <p>It takes two to make a thing go right,</p>
        <p>So if you're feeling what I'm feeling, then tonight's the night.</p>
        <p>So we can make plans to make things better,</p>
        <p>You're my girl for life, so I'm down for whatever.</p>
