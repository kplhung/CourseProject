        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 17 news article assessing progress in Kosovo under the United Nations administrator, Bernard Kouchner, hints at two issues important for both the Balkans and peacekeeping generally.</p>
        <p>The first is the difficulty in getting even NATO's ''well-armed troops'' to enforce peace if they risk a violent reaction. Protecting their forces is usually commanders' top priority in peacekeeping, not mission goals.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 17 news article assessing progress in Kosovo under the United Nations administrator, Bernard Kouchner, hints at two issues important for both the Balkans and peacekeeping generally.</p>
        <p>The first is the difficulty in getting even NATO's ''well-armed troops'' to enforce peace if they risk a violent reaction. Protecting their forces is usually commanders' top priority in peacekeeping, not mission goals.</p>
        <p>The same is true of United Nations peace operations, which -- with American soldiers not at risk -- are sometimes derided in Washington for timidity. A United Nations investment in training and equipping troops from developing countries, which are less skittish about casualties, can strengthen peacekeeping performance.</p>
        <p>The second issue, specific to Kosovo, is the continued lack of a political process for determining its eventual status. A year's delay has helped cool wartime passions. But the major powers must soon initiate dialogue among interested parties in Kosovo, the Balkans and the Security Council toward an internationally supported status for the territory.</p>

        <p>The writer is executive director of policy studies for the United Nations Association of the United States.</p>
