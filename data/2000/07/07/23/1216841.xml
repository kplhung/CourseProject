        <p>A yearlong $20 million renovation of Seattle's emblematic Space Needle, the graceful 605-foot tower originally built to lend a futuristic air to the 1962 World's Fair, was completed last month.</p>
        <p>The most significant addition is the pavilion, a two-story cylindrical glass structure that nestles inside the base of the tower, replacing the old ticket booth and lobby and also containing the gift shop that was on the observation deck. A glass-enclosed ramp now circles the base, leading from street-level ticket windows to the elevator. A new Broad Street turnaround allows visitors to be dropped off near the base of the ramp. The observation deck has been remodeled and has guides who can identify landmarks and answer questions about other points of interest. The tower's two revolving restaurants have been combined into the new SkyCity restaurant, which showcases Pacific Northwest ingredients.</p>

        <p>A yearlong $20 million renovation of Seattle's emblematic Space Needle, the graceful 605-foot tower originally built to lend a futuristic air to the 1962 World's Fair, was completed last month.</p>
        <p>The most significant addition is the pavilion, a two-story cylindrical glass structure that nestles inside the base of the tower, replacing the old ticket booth and lobby and also containing the gift shop that was on the observation deck. A glass-enclosed ramp now circles the base, leading from street-level ticket windows to the elevator. A new Broad Street turnaround allows visitors to be dropped off near the base of the ramp.

The tower's two revolving restaurants have been combined into the new SkyCity restaurant, which showcases Pacific Northwest ingredients.</p>
        <p>The structure is privately owned by a Seattle family, the Wrights.</p>
        <p>The Space Needle, which is open daily, is at the corner of Fifth Avenue North and Broad Street. Observation deck admission is $11, $5 children 5 to 12; entry fees are waived for restaurant customers who spend at least $15 a person at lunch or $25 at dinner, excluding alcohol.
