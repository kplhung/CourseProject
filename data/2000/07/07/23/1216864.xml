        <p>How about calling an end to cynicism? If, as A.O. Scott writes (The Way We Live Now, July 2), the zeal for Harry Potter is simply part of the ''blockbuster-driven culture'' in which ''new books linger on the front tables of Barnes &amp; Noble for a few weeks, then head for the pulp mills,'' why has the first book in the series lingered on the best-seller list for 80 weeks in hardcover? The real story isn't the consummate marketing of Harry Potter; it's the fact that our generation is lucky to have a novelist who brings magic to storytelling. Scholastic's marketing department could not have ''cooked up'' this kind of excitement; J.K. Rowling did, and more power to her.</p>
