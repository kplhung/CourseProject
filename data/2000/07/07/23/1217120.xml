        <p>Mutual fund industry has always been given to fads, and latest is wireless technology; four wireless sector funds have opened this year, and another is set to join them; last year, it was Internet funds, which now number 20-30, up from three in 1998; 25 telecommunications funds are open to set to open, up from 10 in 1998; drawing, chart (M)</p>

        <p>TELEVISION. Atomic energy. Biotechnology.</p>
        <p>The mutual fund industry is 76 years old, but it still has a teenager's crush on the latest fad. Some crushes stick. (Think health care funds.) Some don't. (More later  on the fate of the nation's only golf fund.) Whatever the infatuation of the moment, the industry remains on an eternal quest to subdivide new slivers of the market in order to attract fresh money.</p>
        <p>The current buzzword is ''wireless.'' At least four funds that focus on all things wireless have opened this year, and regulatory paperwork has been filed for a fifth,  from Fidelity Investments. And the telecommunications fund sector, previously the best way to play wireless stocks, has swelled from 10 funds at the end of 1998 to about 25 that are either open or in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>Last year, the fund industry discovered the Internet. There are now 20 to 30 Internet funds, up from just three in early 1998. But now that the Internet reaches into every facet of technology, it has become difficult to distinguish many Internet funds from technology funds.</p>
        <p>The top holdings of the largest Internet fund, the $8.5 billion Munder NetNet, include Cisco Systems, Verisign and JDS Uniphase; they could be the top holdings of any technology fund, or of a supposedly broad-based aggressive-growth fund.</p>
        <p>So will wireless funds simply be telecommunications funds in flashier clothes?</p>
        <p>Perhaps not. Consider the $4 billion Invesco Telecommunications fund, the best-performing fund in its sector over the last five years. Its manager, Brian B. Hayward, has almost 20 percent of his portfolio in what he describes as wireless stocks, from companies that create components for wireless devices to makers of finished products.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Hayward has been cautious about wireless of late. It is not because of the area's soaring valuations: Nokia, a leading maker of cellular phone handsets and  the consensus choice of money managers looking for a must-have wireless play, trades at about 70 times earnings, about twice the price-to-earnings ratio of the S. &amp; P. 500 stock index.</p>
        <p>But such valuations come with the territory, and Mr. Hayward sees his favorite area, optical networking, as even more expensive -- and more worth the price.</p>
        <p>Why is he hesitant on wireless? ''We started hearing of a plateauing of growth in France,'' he said, speaking of his reading of recent subscriber growth numbers in that country. ''Perhaps handset growth won't have the upside potential we've seen over the past 18 months.''</p>
        <p>Another concern, he added, is the skyrocketing prices being paid by telecommunications companies for the right to use the radio-wave spectrums to transmit more data to Internet-capable cell phones. In a round of bidding in April, the British government extracted $36 billion for five spectrum licenses that will allow the transmission of far more data than current technology does.</p>
        <p>''The costs were five times greater than people expected,'' Mr. Hayward said. ''That was something hanging over wireless stocks the past few months. The price has been extrapolated to other countries, and that leaves companies with less money to build the networks.''</p>
        <p>So what is a wireless manager to buy? Seth Kirkham, 27, co-manager of the $45 million Guinness Flight Wireless World fund, pitches his fund as more than just a narrower version of a telecommunications fund. ''We're going to play this theme right across the economy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That includes buying companies like Nordic Baltic Holdings, a financial services company that lets customers use cell phones as portable money machines.</p>
        <p>''In the last month, we've stayed away from the operators -- AT&amp;T Wireless, Sprint PCS, Vodafone Airtouch,'' Mr. Kirkham said. ''We still think there's good value, but the market is becoming concerned with licensing costs.''</p>
        <p>Still, whereas Mr. Hayward is building positions in companies focused on the fiber optics end of the telecommunications sector, like Corning and JDS Uniphase, Mr. Kirkham has instead focused on wireless component builders like M Systems Flash Disk Pioneers, which makes semiconductors used in wireless devices.</p>
        <p>By design, then, wireless funds are likely to be more volatile than telecommunications funds, just as many Internet funds have proved to be more volatile than broad technology funds. Investors might consider that 6 of the bottom 10 funds of the year have the word Internet in their names.</p>
        <p>But so far, so good. The Wireless Fund from Value Trend Capital Management is up 4.8 percent since its April inception. The Turner Wireless and Communications fund is up 16 percent from its July 1 start, and the ProFunds Wireless Communications UltraSector fund is up 8.5 percent during its one-month history. But Guinness Wireless World is down 1.5 percent since it opened in February.</p>
        <p>Of course, the real question for fund companies is whether the public will buy. The jury is still out, but for Value Trend, a money manager in El Cajon, Calif., wireless sure beats golf. After more than a year, the company's Value Trend Links, the nation's only golf-focused mutual fund, had gathered only $1.5 million in assets. In four months, Value Trend's Wireless has gathered $30 million. Value Trend Links is being retrofitted as a growth fund -- there goes all that British Open cross-marketing potential.</p>
