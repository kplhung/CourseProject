        <p>Katharina Elisabeth Margarethe Plath and Paul Dallan Kaminski were married on Friday by Manfred Hulsenbruch, a civil marriage official at Schloss Friedrichstein, a baroque castle in Bad Wildungen, Germany. A church ceremony took place yesterday at the Philipp-Nicolai Church in Alt Wildungen. The Rev. Ulrich Branner, a Lutheran minister, officiated with Msgr. Edward Baldwin, a Roman Catholic priest from Detroit.</p>
        <p>The bride, 34, will continue to use her name professionally. She is the director of market development in New York for Donghia Furniture and Textiles, the home furnishings company. She graduated from a technical school specializing in the furniture business in Cologne, Germany. Her parents, Renate and Ulrich Plath, live in Bad Wildungen, where her father, now retired, owned Ulrich Plath, a commercial furniture distribution company, which he founded. Her mother, also retired, taught music, history and German at a primary school there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaminski, 38, graduated from the University of Michigan and is a partner and the chief financial officer of Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Company, an investment firm in New York. His parents, Angela and Dallan Kaminski, live in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where his father, now retired, was a salesman for the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. His mother, a retired registered nurse, worked for a physician in Southfield, Mich.</p>
        <p>The couple met in London in 1995 at a friend's wedding. Ms. Plath was then engaged, and the bride wanted to introduce Mr. Kaminski to another woman. But, Mr. Kaminski said, it was ''starry eyes across a crowded room'' at the reception. The couple were seated at the same table, the woman Mr. Kaminski was supposed to get to know on his right, his future wife across from him.</p>
        <p>''It was a matter of talking to the person to your right for your first course, talking to the person to your left for the second course and trying to talk across the table as much as you can,'' Mr. Kaminski said.</p>
        <p>A few months later, Ms. Plath broke her engagement and began a long-distance courtship with Mr. Kaminski. Eight times a year, they would rendezvous in New York, London, Athens or Paris. Their phone bills quadrupled, they said. Finally, in April 1999, Ms. Plath was transferred to her company's New York office.</p>
        <p>Last New Year's Eve, the couple became engaged at Mena House Oberoi, a hotel in Egypt with a view of the Great Pyramids.</p>
        <p>At the church yesterday, the bride seated some single men and women among her 250 guests together. ''I'm very good at matchmaking,'' she said.</p>
