        <p>IN Soviet days, filmmakers came to this graceful city looking for a backdrop for historical dramas with men in top hats and ladies smothered in furs dashing along snowy streets in horse-drawn sleighs.</p>
        <p>Not any more. In the last two years, St. Petersburg has become the hottest location for the hottest trend on Russian television: gritty, tell-it-like-it-is cop shows and their many spinoffs, coming to Russian screens this fall.</p>
        <p>Forget palaces and carriages, balls and picnics. Now the stories are set in the city's dank courtyards and dingy stairwells, featuring bloodied corpses, distraught prostitutes and cynical hit men -- familiar stuff for Russian television viewers who for the last 10 years have been treated to a steady stream of of contract killings, war and violence on their nightly news shows.</p>
        <p>The boom began in early 1998 with ''The Street of Broken Streetlights,'' a St. Petersburg version of ''Hill Street Blues,'' starring a group of four likable, slightly goofy cops, earnest versions of the old ''wild and crazy guys'' on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Nicknamed ''Menty,'' the Russian slang word for cops, the program is now about to enter its third season, and its 58th episode.</p>
        <p>Whether they are kicking down doors to communal apartments or careering down the embankments by the city's famous canals in their boxy little Lada cars, toasting witnesses with a shot of vodka or joshing with informers on Nevsky Prospekt, the foursome have bumbled their way to stardom. Fans stop them on the streets in Siberia and Odessa, and buy videos of the show in Brighton Beach and Israel.</p>
        <p>Now, in their wake, half a dozen mini-series are being shot or are on the drawing boards in St. Petersburg, starring counterintelligence agents, mafia dons, tough female investigators and other heroes and villains in Russia's newly recast obsession with the struggle between good and evil.</p>
        <p>''It was a big mistake for these past years to think that people don't heed heroes, when heroes are a natural part of the human story,'' said Ada Staviskaya, whose Panaroma studio is producing two new heroines for television. In ''Secrets of the Investigation,'' the star is a deputy prosecutor and a ''seeker of truth,'' to quote the press release for the season's new programs, while ''Hunt for Cinderella'' stars a mysterious and ultimately beautiful woman who undergoes plastic surgery, suffers from amnesia and emerges as a Russian version of ''La Femme Nikita.''</p>
        <p>Also coming up is a second season of ''Agent of National Security,'' offering ''a no-nonsense street-smart guy'' and ''a seeker of justice in an unjust world.''  With two more series in the development stages (including ''Baron,'' portraying a prodigy Jewish violinist who later presents himself as a local Gypsy king), Media-MOST, Russia's largest private media company, which owns both the TNT network and NTV, a national channel, has taken the lead in the Petersburg mini-series boom, although ORT, its archrival, weighed in last winter with its own Petersburg action series, ''Killing Power.''</p>
        <p>One exception to the contemporary motif is ''Empire,'' a 12-part series due to be broadcast in October on ORT, which takes a step back in time and re-enacts -- again in St. Petersburg -- a string of history-making ''hits'' or terrorist attacks that took place during the final decades of the Romanov empire.</p>
        <p>The choice of St. Petersburg as a venue has an echo in real life. In recent years, the city has become known as Russia's crime capital, made infamous by a string of contract killings, including the shooting death, in the winter of 1998, of Galina Starovoitova, a leading reform democrat, and two murders, in broad daylight on Nevsky Prospekt, of top-ranking city officials, one by a sniper's bullet and the other by a bomb neatly placed on a car roof.</p>
        <p>The local police and politicians hotly dispute this reputation, noting -- accurately -- that Moscow and its surrounding region are at the top of national crime charts. But perceptions linger, and the spate of TV programs have only further enhanced the cloud over the city's image.</p>
        <p>For Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of the Hermitage State Museum, the last straw was a program earlier this year with the unnuanced title of ''Bandit Petersburg,'' which even featured skulduggery at Russia's most venerable museum. ''Of course, when every day the words 'Bandit Petersburg' are flashed on the screen, it is not going to please anyone in Petersburg,'' he said during a TV interview. ''And when they drag in the Hermitage, then they are really going too far.''</p>
        <p>The interviewer, after thanking Mr. Piotrovsky for appearing on her prime-time program, couldn't help but note that ''Bandit Petersburg'' was coming up next.</p>
        <p>Like many trend-setting programs, ''Broken Streetlights'' -- the brainchild of Sergei Skvartsov, now general director of the TV division of Media-MOST -- took a long time reaching the screen. Its success, when it finally went on the air, was its appeal to a market that, after years of splurging on imported goods, had developed a craving for local, down-home fare.</p>
        <p>''When American films burst onto Russian screens in the early 1990's, Russian viewers soon found that the American way of life was something very, very far away from their own,'' said Aleksandr Kapitsa, the veteran producer of ''Broken Streetlights.''  ''But our guys are familiar, they are the guy next door, your neighbor on the trolley bus, your brother, your son. They are charming and they are recognizable, with no pretensions, just trying to do their jobs in bad conditions.''</p>
        <p>The conditions are indeed familiar. Shot entirely on location, the series uses the back building of a police station on Vasily Island as its own ''headquarters,'' where it can shoot only on weekends, when the real cops in the Lost and Stolen Documents Division have their days off. The authenticity is unmistakable, from the broken windowpanes to the dusty piles of documents, the naked lightbulbs and the chipped concrete.</p>
        <p>This shabbiness is part of the charm people associate with ''Peter,'' the Russian nickname for the former imperial capital, which, in contrast to the flash and bustle of Moscow, has preserved not only its czarist-era beauty but also the slow pace and grunginess of its recent Soviet past.</p>
        <p>''One man called from Israel,'' said Aleksei Nilov, a 36-year-old actor who plays one of the four main roles. ''He was all emotional and said he watches the show with great nostalgia because, he said, it captures the Petersburg where he was born and brought up.''</p>
        <p>Where there are heroes, there are also myths. And for all the realism of ''Menty,'' there is also an element of make-believe in the slightly rosy, good-humored picture of the life and times of a big-city Russian police station.</p>
        <p>''Cinema is the creator of myths,'' said Dmitri Svetozarov, director of the ''Agent'' series. ''There were myths about the Soviet policeman. And now there are these myths about the contemporary policemen, showing them drinking vodka, dozing on the job, all of which helps the viewers see themselves in these characters. These myths may not be true either, but at least it is a new myth.''</p>
        <p>In truth, most Russian police officers are apt to be a bit more bribable, and less successful at tracking down their prey, than their TV counterparts. ''This is the police our viewers wish they had but don't,'' admitted Mr. Kapitsa. ''And the police like it because it makes them look good.''</p>
        <p>St. Petersburg's quiet streets and picturesque backdrops are one reason this city is becoming, as some here now call it, Hollywood on the Neva. ''The city itself is made for filming,'' explained Nikolai Suslov, producer of ''Empire'' and before that the technical producer of ''Killing Power.''</p>
        <p>But another motive is more prosaic. Although St. Petersburg is Russia's second-largest city, it is significantly cheaper than Moscow. According to Mr. Suslov, expenses here are, on the average, 20 to 40 percent less than in the capital and actors' wages -- which, on average, equal $200 a day -- are literally half the going Moscow rate.</p>
        <p>For St. Petersburg's hard-pressed theater world, the arrival of the mini-series has proved to be a lifeline at a time when Russian cinema is still languishing. ''I keep saying that these series play a humanitarian role in St. Petersburg,'' said Mr. Svetozarov. ''We are returning to viewers those actors who had disappeared from the big screeen. We are restoring those old contacts.''</p>
        <p>The birth of the series has also restored some life to the vast inner-city studios at Lenfilm, once one of the powerhouses of Soviet cinema and now a mournful shell of dilapidated buildings and junked-up courtyards.</p>
        <p>BUT the industry here has a way to go before it reaches  Hollywood standards. Lacking equipment for synchronized sounds, actors have to return to the studio to dub in their voices, and scriptwriters are in a constant  scramble to keep up with the pace of production.</p>
        <p>All this is a particular strain for producers and directors brought up in the Soviet school, when film-making was a leisurely, labor-intensive process. Now filming that used to take months is packed into a single week.</p>
        <p>''We still don't have the kind of industry they have in America,'' Mr. Kapitsa said. ''But for the money that any American director would think of as low budget, we can shoot something that is very decent.''</p>
