        <p>DON'T go looking for Tammy Faye Messner's autobiography (''Tammy: Telling It My Way'') in your local Christian bookstore. Informed that Ms. Messner is the former Tammy Faye Bakker, a clerk responded, ''We don't carry that kind of material.''</p>
        <p>Poor Ms. Messner. In the 1980's, when she and Jim Bakker, then her husband, headed the PTL television ministry, spreading the gospel to 13.5 million homes and generating more than $120 million in annual revenues, her spidery eyelashes and crocodile tears served as fodder for countless late-night television satires. She struggled with drug addiction, a workaholic husband and the strains of raising a family on camera. Even the cushy lifestyles of her dogs were criticized.</p>
        <p>Then in 1987 she looked on as Jim Bakker publicly admitted using $265,000 of PTL money in an unsuccessful bid to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, a church secretary who claimed he had sex with her in a Florida hotel room. A disgraced Mr. Bakker handed control of PTL over to the rival televangelist Jerry Falwell, who put the ministry into bankruptcy and smeared him as a homosexual. Tammy Faye watched their media empire crumble. With her husband convicted of defrauding PTL supporters of $158 million and sentenced to prison, she was reduced to selling off her television wardrobe to get by.</p>
        <p>Her faith has been tested. Now, in the twilight of her celebrity, must she suffer a final indignity by being resurrected as a gay icon?</p>
        <p>''We've always been intrigued by her,'' said Randy Barbato, who was in New York with Fenton Bailey to talk about ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' the documentary they produced and directed about Christian broadcasting's former first lady, which opened Friday. ''Christianity and materialism, spirituality and fabulousness -- somehow, she manages to wrap them up in one package. We all spend a lot of time feeling bad about ourselves, because sometimes we feel spiritual and sometimes we want to go shopping. Well, that's what she is, a fabulous mess.''</p>
        <p>Organized in tidy chapters, which are introduced by hand puppets, the film charts Tammy Faye LaValley's rise from her humble origins as the eldest child in a devout family of eight living in International Falls, Minn. At 10 she found God, falling flat on her back in an Assemblies of God church and speaking in tongues; at 16, she discovered makeup, and the two have never left her. In 1961, when she was 19, she wed Jim Bakker, a fellow student at North Central Bible College in Minneapolis. They were promptly expelled for marrying, but soon began touring the Bible Belt as itinerant preachers.</p>
        <p>Televangelism was in its infancy in 1965, when they got their start at Pat Robertson's fledgling Christian Broadcasting Network, where they created a children's program and Mr. Bakker founded ''The 700 Club,'' Christian television's first talk show. Seven years later, eased out by Mr. Robertson, they moved to California, where, with Jane and Paul Crouch, they founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (now the biggest force in televangelism). But that partnership also foundered.</p>
        <p>At last, in 1974, they started the PTL (for Praise the Lord) Network in an abandoned furniture store in Charlotte, N.C. Mixing glitzy entertainment with down-home family values, and preaching a ''prosperity gospel'' which put a divine seal of approval on both the growing affluence of American evangelicals and the showy lifestyles of their television ministers, PTL quickly mushroomed into a vast corporate enterprise. Heritage U.S.A., the $200 million Christian retreat that Jim Bakker built with PTL money, ranked right up there with Disney World and Disneyland as one of the nation's most popular theme parks.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye Bakker was a co-host of ''The Jim and Tammy Show,'' but she also produced her own programs, including the daily ''Tammy Faye's House Party,'' where she entertained guests, offered advice on homemaking and shopping, staged fashion shows, danced, sang and made fudge.</p>
        <p>Speaking by telephone, the Rev. Mel White, a gay Christian advocate who (before coming out as gay) worked closely with many of the major televangelists, explained her appeal: ''For the evangelical community she was Dr. Joyce Brothers, Martha Stewart and Carol Burnett, all rolled into one.''</p>
        <p>But ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' also reveals a more radical Tammy, who was the host of shows on controversial topics like penile implants, interviewed a gay minister with AIDS in the earliest days of public debate about the illness and reached out to drug addicts and others excluded by the broader evangelical community.</p>
        <p>Mr. White is convinced that, for PTL's largely rural, female and older audience, Tammy Faye Bakker provided an image of empowerment.</p>
        <p>''Her fans were people who grew up in a very fundamentalist tradition,'' he said, ''not being able to wear makeup, or dance, or go out in public. So here comes Tammy, with her dyed hair and makeup, her ebullient spirit and outspoken ways with both men and women. She talked about sex, and flirted with Jimmy. She took on the caricature of an obedient wife, and blasted it. You have never seen Pat Robertson's wife, or Jerry Falwell's wife. They stay at home, doing what those wives do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey and Mr. Barbato were introduced to Tammy Faye Bakker's work by their friend and business associate RuPaul Charles, the actor, performer and drag superstar, who narrates the documentary. A decade ago, the couple invited Ms. Bakker to appear on a talk show for British television that they were shooting in the basement of their Los Angeles home.</p>
        <p>''For the same segment, we also invited Sister Paula, a transvestite televangelist based in Seattle,'' Mr. Barbato recalled. ''We timed it so that they wouldn't meet, but they ended up crossing paths in our living room. And Tammy Faye was really cool about it. Somehow she surprised us.''</p>
        <p>The couple have lived and worked together since they met as students at New York University film school 17 years ago. Mr. Bailey is British and was educated at Oxford; Mr. Barbato is from New Jersey. ''I bring the low culture,'' he says, ''and Fenton brings the high.'' World of Wonder, their Los Angeles-based production company, has turned out documentaries on subjects ranging from male prostitutes in Los Angeles to the experience of a juror on the O. J. Simpson trial to the off-screen life of Ellen DeGeneres. Currently, they're developing ''Party Monster,'' a documentary they made about Michael Alig (a former denizen of the downtown New York club scene, now serving time for manslaughter), into a feature with the producer Christine Vachon.</p>
        <p>''There's an element of irony and tragic laughter that pervades all their work,'' said Sheila Nevins, an executive vice president of HBO, who has worked with the pair on numerous occasions. (HBO produced ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' with Cinemax.) ''And they have a style all their own, very clever and twisted Gen X-meets-'Nightline.' They don't consider the documentary form so holy that it can't be played with. After all, you don't always have to tiptoe so gently around reality. Sometimes you can just toss it up in the air and see where it lands.''</p>
        <p>A combination of sincerity and irreverence has frequently led them to focus on figures reviled in mainstream culture.</p>
        <p>''A common thread running through our work is our interest in people who have been marginalized, judged or excluded,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''We live in celebritocracy, we need these larger-than-life media personalities, and yet it's as if we have a moral prejudice against those who live for the camera.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barbato concurred. ''Somehow, having them as targets to judge makes us feel better about ourselves,'' he said. ''In Tammy Faye's case, after a certain point, everyone was invited to pick up a stone and throw it at her.''</p>
        <p>Their latest film is also a fable about the strange afterlife of television. In the early 1990's, Ms. Messner, who had divorced Jim Bakker and married Roe Messner, the developer of Heritage U.S.A. (who in 1995 was himself convicted of bankruptcy fraud), found herself shut out of Christian broadcasting. In 1996 she became a co-host of a talk show on the Fox network with Jim J. Bullock, an openly gay actor, but the show was short-lived, and her secular media comeback is still awaited.</p>
        <p>''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' opens with Ms. Messner living in relative seclusion in the California desert, awaiting Roe Messner's return from prison -- ministering to her Yorkshire terriers, writing poetry and playing the organ in her Palm Springs church on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''You can't go forward looking into the rearview mirror of your life,'' she cautions.</p>
        <p>Yet her magnetism, faith and strength of character remain unshaken.</p>
        <p>''We wanted Tammy Faye to sing the Gloria Gaynor anthem, 'I Will Survive,' as the credits rolled,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''But she wouldn't do it.''</p>
