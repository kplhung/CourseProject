        <p>HELEN ARMSTRONG needed a way to lure fellow musicians out of New York and up to her 18th-century house in Washington for a mid-summer visit. So she devised a plan no musician could resist: she invited them to play in a chamber music concert.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe we had an audience,'' Ms. Armstrong said. ''It was a very hot night. We held it at the Washington Club Hall. The fans were going, we had all the doors open, there were dogs running through the room.</p>
        <p>That was 17 years ago. What began for her as a social event with music, in which she and her friends played for the sheer joy of music-making has since evolved into the Armstrong Chamber Concerts, and encompasses series in Litchfield and Fairfield counties as well as Carnegie Hall recitals, corporate events and educational programs.</p>
        <p>''That was the start of my chamber music career,'' said Ms. Armstrong, who is a violinist. ''It had all been solo up to that point. In the audience at that first concert was Avery Fisher, who advised Ms. Armstrong to put her name on the series. ''It's yours and nobody can take your name away from you,'' she recalled him telling her. Others gave her the same advice and so the Armstrong Chamber Concert series was born. She now draws from a pool of 40 musicians for the year-round calendar of performances.</p>
        <p>''One of the rewards you get,'' she said, ''is the sharing of ideas and communicating with people we don't see all the time. My musicians say it's refreshing and enlightening to play with different people. It opens up a whole new world.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Armstrong, who has an elegant mother hen way about her, said she spends hours planning the combinations of musicians and repertory. ''When I put my groups together,'' she said, ''it's like planning a dinner party; I put the right people together so there is that spark.'' In her view, the program is the menu.</p>
        <p>By the late 80's, Ms. Armstrong had gathered enough momentum to hold a fund-raising event. She called up a childhood friend and fellow violinist, Itzhak Perlman, who performed at the event. ''I met him when he was 13 years old. We were at the same music camp for seven summers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Even more significant for Ms. Armstrong these days is music education. ''One of my first loves is what I can do for our young people,'' she said. ''Only 30 percent of the schools in this country have a music program. I'm overwhelmed by how much talent out there that is uncultivated.'' Ms. Armstrong said she tailors each school program individually by working directly with the superintendent, principal and music teachers.</p>
        <p>Among her most rewarding outreach experiences was at a prison in Danbury. ''I went there four times last year,'' she said. ''We had been doing that for four years until the funding ran out. Those inmates, they felt life, through the music, was worth living.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Armstrong first held a violin at the age of 3; her mother was her teacher. At 13, she said, her mother asked her if she wanted to continue. Before long she enrolled at the Juilliard School and was a student of Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay. In 1976 she made her New York debut at Lincoln Center. She has appeared as guest soloist with the Boston Pops and the Indianapolis Symphony, and has toured North America, Europe and Asia as a recitalist.</p>
        <p>In the late 70's, her husband, Alan Cohen, a building contractor, died of cancer. She continued to give concerts and brought her two young children along. Three years ago, she married Ajit Hutheesing, the chairman and chief executive officer of International Capital Partners, Inc. in Stamford. Now she splits her time between Litchfield and Fairfield Counties.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, Ms. Armstrong began a Greenwich salon series, which will again be offered this fall in private homes and includes dinner, wine and music. The Washington series continues at the First Congregational Church. On Aug. 12, Armstrong Chamber Concerts will give a free performance at Hurlburt Park at the Pavilion in Roxbury, beginning at 6 p.m. In the spring, there will be two concerts in the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall.</p>
