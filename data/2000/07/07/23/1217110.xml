        <p>A proposal by the Metropolitan Transit Authority to use three Riverdale side streets to turn buses around has upset some neighborhood leaders and residents of this quiet  area.</p>
        <p>The buses travel north and south along Riverdale Avenue and make U-turns at the Yonkers border. But M.T.A. officials fear that the opening on July 31 of the Classic Hyatt, a 17-story home for the elderly at the turnaround site, will create a traffic nightmare because of the Hyatt's big parking lot and increased pedestrian traffic by the home's residents.</p>
        <p>M.T.A. officials have offered three solutions, two of which would use turn-arounds in Yonkers. But one would be to have northbound buses turn right on 261st Street, left up Delafield Avenue, left again on 263rd Street and then head southbound on Riverdale Avenue. These turns are on quiet residential streets in Riverdale.</p>
        <p>Riverdale leaders say that because the Hyatt's address is in Yonkers, though the building straddles the border, any traffic burden associated with the center should be borne by Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''Why should North Riverdale deal with Yonkers's problem?'' said Laura Spalter, president of the Riverdale Community Association.</p>
        <p>Councilwoman June M. Eisland, whose district includes Riverdale, has asked the M.T.A. to postpone plans until a meeting with both Riverdale and Yonkers leaders can be arranged. She said the M.T.A. had agreed.</p>
        <p>''What we're doing right now is looking to see what can be done,'' said Deirdre Parker, a spokeswoman for New York City Transit, part of the M.T.A. ''We're meeting with community leaders from both Yonkers and Riverdale to come up with the best solution. Nothing is etched in stone yet.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Eisland and Ms. Spalter said the proposed streets in Riverdale are ill suited for use by large city buses because they are too narrow. The  quality of life of residents there would also be adversely affected, they said.</p>
        <p>''First of all, these are just suggestions, and two involve New York City buses turning around in Yonkers,'' said a Yonkers councilwoman, Symra Brandon. ''We're trying to remediate the problem, and I'm sure that something can be worked out.''</p>
