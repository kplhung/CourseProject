        <p>ANTICIPATION of a major Navy command's moving to the historic Washington Navy Yard early next year is bringing new life to a long-neglected neighborhood across the tracks from Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>In January, the Naval Sea Systems Command, known as Navsea, will begin transferring its 4,125 employees now working in leased space in northern Virginia to four buildings in the Navy Yard, a little more than a mile southeast of the Capitol along the Anacostia River. They will join more than 1,300 employees from other commands who have moved to refurbished buildings in the Navy Yard since 1997.</p>
        <p>The sea systems command, the largest of the Navy's five system commands, designs builds and maintains the Navy's ships and their weapons and related equipment. It employs 46,000 people around the world. Of the 4,125 who will be transferred to the Navy Yard, 3,767 are civilians and 358 are military personnel.</p>
        <p>Last year, the sea systems command had a budget of $18.8 billion, an amount roughly equal to Coca-Cola's revenues, said Vice Adm. G. P. Nanos, its commander. Of this amount, about three-quarters goes to contractors and other vendors, he said.</p>
        <p>By midyear, more than 10,000 people will be working at the 65-acre walled compound, which was acquired by the Navy in 1799 and is its oldest installation ashore. One of its gates was designed in 1806 by Benjamin Latrobe, one of the architects of the Capitol. Too narrow for automobiles, it was built with ox carts in mind.</p>
        <p>Spurred by the Navy's move, three new office buildings are being built by real estate developers near the Navy Yard in what is one of the poorest areas of Washington. Next summer, some 4,000 people who work for the sea systems command's contractors will begin moving into the new buildings.</p>
        <p>The move by the sea systems command and its contractors is an outgrowth of the Base Realignment and Closure Acts of 1993 and 1995, which directed that eight major Navy commands move outside the Washington area. With one exception, Navy commands that remained were directed to move out of leased space in privately owned buildings and onto military bases.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Congress approved spending $200 million to turn the historic Navy Yard into a modern office center. Parts of the yard were then being used for ceremonial functions, and some buildings for office space. The base also had quarters for the chief of naval operations and other senior officers. The Navy Museum at the yard attracts 400,000 visitors a year.</p>
        <p>Three of the four buildings being occupied by the sea systems command were part of a naval gun factory that during World War II employed 26,000 workers. The largest building was used to assemble all of the 16-inch guns used on World War II battleships. The five-story building, with a four-story addition, now has 680,000 square feet of space.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the command's headquarters are in Crystal City, a high-rise mixed-use complex not far from the Pentagon in Arlington County, Va. There, the Navy leases about a million square feet in nine buildings.</p>
        <p>Admiral Nanos said the command's employees were concerned about the lack of amenities in the area surrounding the Navy Yard. But he noted that when sea systems  and other major Navy commands moved to Crystal City from offices on the Mall in Washington in the early 1970's, there were no restaurants or services to speak of there, either. Today, there are hundreds of shops and restaurants, extension divisions of five universities and even a Shakespearean theater within walking distance of the Navy offices.</p>
        <p>Once the Navy vacates its space at Crystal City, the buildings are expected to be extensively renovated and then re-leased.</p>
        <p>Once it became clear that the sea systems command would be moving, the rush was on to build office buildings to house Navy contractors across the street from the Navy Yard. Although only a few contractors are required to have offices close by, Admiral Nanos said, most find it convenient to do so. The 250 acres that surround the Navy Yard have long been cut off from the adjacent Capitol Hill neighborhood by railroad tracks and elevated highways. The area contains heavy-equipment garages and storage yards, now-idled printing plants and three public housing complexes.</p>
        <p>LAST November, Potomac Investment Properties, a Washington company owned by the Gewirz family for three generations, broke ground for 300 M Street SE, an eight-story, 282,000 square-foot office building on a one-acre site near the gate that the sea systems command's employees will use to enter the Navy Yard. It is scheduled to open in the middle of next year. The building will include an underground garage with 250 parking spaces, a staff of security guards, a cafeteria for employees and a health club.</p>
        <p>Potomac Investment bought the site, a former police substation, in 1989 because of its proximity to the Navy Yard and and the subway station that serves it. Potomac Investment's new building is now fully leased  to tenants that include Litton PRC, Lockheed Martin and EG&amp;G, said Brian Raher of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate services company that negotiated leases for two of the tenants. Initial annual rents are around $30 a square foot, including utilities and all services, Mr. Raher said.</p>
        <p>Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers, a real estate services firm with offices in Washington and Boston, was the next to build office space near the Navy Yard. Last July, it signed a $5.5 million contract for a 45,000-square-foot site at 80 M Street SE, once  occupied by Tracks, a well-known gay nightclub. The site is adjacent to the Navy Yard Metro station and about four blocks from the Navy Yard gate that the sea systems command will use.</p>
        <p>Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers broke ground for its seven-story, 270,900-square-foot building in February, and it is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2001. About 95 percent of the building has been leased at rents of about $30 to $35 a square foot, including utilities and all services, said Paul Robertson, the Spaulding &amp; Slye Colliers partner in charge of the project.</p>
        <p>After surveying tenants, the developer decided to include a 2,000-square-foot fitness center, a 5,000-square-foot cafe, more underground parking and shuttle-bus service operating 12 hours a day to the Navy Yard and to the Eastern Market Metro station.  Tenants at 80 M Street include British Aerospace, Northrup Grumman and KPMG.</p>
        <p>On June 22, a joint venture of Washington Gas and Lincoln Property began construction of a four-story, 180,000-square-foot office building on a 12-acre site on the east end of the Navy Yard that the utility had used for manufacturing gas for nearly a hundred years. The gas plant was shut down in 1983,  and Washington Gas continues to pump and treat groundwater at the site to remove contaminants, said its project manager, Mary Jean Brady.</p>
        <p>The building, the first of four to be built around a courtyard opening out to the Anacostia River, is scheduled to be completed in September. It is currently 75 percent leased to tenants that include Computer Science, General Dynamics and the Newport News Shipbuilding, said Harold W. Pfohl, a vice president of Lincoln Properties. A 250-room hotel is also planned.</p>
        <p>RECENTLY, investors have begun to put together sites in the area to serve demand that the new office space is expected to generate for shopping and services. In June, for example, DTI Associates, an Arlington support services contractor, bought an existing 35,000-square-foot building at 810 Potomac Avenue SE, a block from the Navy Yard. It plans to occupy some of the space and to rent the remainder to retail or restaurant tenants, said Charles Katis of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who represented DTI.</p>
        <p>Although the Navy reports that crime affecting Navy Yard personnel is infrequent, the perception of danger, reinforced by crumbling buildings, rubble-strewn lots and public housing in the area has acted as a brake on new market-rate housing.</p>
        <p>Yet it is only a matter of time, said Michael Gewirz of Potomac Investment Properties, before waterfront views, pathways along the Anacostia and well-landscaped boulevards the Navy, the federal  Park Service and the District of Columbia government are creating along the river are expected to draw residents. But he added that it would probably take 10 to 15 years for the upscale residential development now taking place along the Potomac River a mile to the west to move to the waterfront near the Navy Yard.</p>
