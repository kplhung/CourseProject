        <p>DAVID WILTSE started his career over 30 years ago as a playwright who happened to write novels. Today he considers himself a novelist who writes plays.</p>
        <p>''The big difference is that when I write a novel, I know it will be published,'' Mr. Wiltse said recently at his home in Weston. ''When I write a play, I don't know if it'll be produced.''</p>
        <p>So far his odds are pretty favorable. Mr. Wiltse's latest play is ''Triangles for Two,'' which has its premiere tomorrow through Aug. 5 at Westport Country Playhouse. Joe Grisafi directs Jeffrey Jones and Jayne Atkinson in the two-character play.</p>
        <p>As a novelist, Mr. Wiltse is best-known for his series of thriller-mysteries concerning the F.B.I. agent John Decker; titles include ''Prayer for the Dead'' and ''Blown Away.''  His latest book, ''Heartland'' (St. Martin Press), which is a departure from Mr. Wiltse's Decker thrillers, is due out in winter.</p>
        <p>New York and regional theater audiences, on the other hand, know Mr. Wiltse for ''Crazy Horse and Three Stars,'' ''Suggs'' and ''Doubles,'' which ran better than two seasons Off Broadway during the 1980's. ''Temporary Help,'' which has been produced at Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, at A.C.T. (A Contemporary Theater) in Seattle, is scheduled for an Off Broadway production this fall. It seems that Mr. Wiltse is a successful playwright in spite of himself.</p>
        <p>''Writing is a solitary occupation,'' said Mr. Wiltse, 59. ''I enjoy doing plays because of the interaction with the little family that forms in production: the actors, director, stage manager. The bonds are quick and easy. Then it dissolves.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Wiltse forms an idea for a story, he knows immediately whether to shape it as a novel or play. His novels, however peppered with catchy dialogue, are more descriptive in character, setting and plot. His plays are simpler in plot and setting and his characters are defined strictly by action, as opposed to introspective narration.</p>
        <p>''There is more freedom in writing plays,'' he said. ''I can write about anything. That's what I love about plays.'' ''Triangles For Two,'' as the title hints at, is three different one-act plays thematically linked by the battle of the sexes. The three scenes vary in style, from tight-lipped intrigue to outright comedy. Mr. Wiltse said that he enjoyed writing in different styles within one play.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atkinson, who happens to be one of Mr. Wiltse's neighbors but has not previously acted in any of his plays, said that different styles was one of the reasons she accepted the role.</p>
        <p>''I liked the idea of playing three different characters,'' said Ms. Atkinson, who earned a Tony nomination last for her performance in ''Rainmaker'' last season. ''Besides, it's comedy and very funny.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiltse said that rehearsals have gone extremely well, which is not always the case. As with any collaborative effort involving artistic personalities, the rehearsal process can be quite frustrating. Mr. Wiltse has seen his share of temperamental actors whose personal needs crowd the always-too-brief rehearsal period. His worst experience was his first New York play, ''Suggs.''</p>
        <p>''An actor absolutely refused to learn the lines as written,'' he said. ''He couldn't be forced. I wound up rewriting the speeches up till opening. We couldn't stop production, especially my first play.'' ''I did learn an important lesson from the experience,'' Mr. Wiltse said. ''Usually, when an actor has trouble with a line, there is something wrong with it. They are often right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiltse said he hasn't changed anything during this rehearsal process. ''Triangles For Two,'' he said, has been through several staged readings over the past five years. ''I changed the script between readings,'' he said. ''Readings are helpful, even if no one says anything about the play afterwards. Just hearing the lines helps you see what's working and what's not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiltse, of course, welcomes offers from producers to bring ''Triangles For Two'' into New York. Given his track record and Westport's proximity to Manhattan, it is likely that a producer or two will be in the audience. Even if the play doesn't go to New York, Mr. Wiltse likes its chances in regional theater.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a play that should have a long, happy life,'' he said. ''It's two characters, simple settings and, at 90 minutes without intermission, the right length. We'll see.''</p>
        <p>''Triangles For Two'' runs tomorrow through Aug. 5 at Westport Country Playhouse, off Post Road East (Route 1) in Westport. Tickets are $10 to $35. The box office number is (203) 227-4177. The Playhouse's Web site is www.westportplay house.com.</p>
