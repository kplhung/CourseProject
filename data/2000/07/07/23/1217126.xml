        <p>TOO much, too soon.</p>
        <p>Investors had reason to smile last week. As expected, neither rising energy costs nor high short-term interest rates stopped a stream of strong second-quarter earnings news. And the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, added to the cheer on Thursday, when traders interpreted his comments as a signal that the economy was slowing and that the Fed might be done raising rates, at least for a while.</p>
        <p>That news sent the Nasdaq composite up more than 3 percent, putting it back into positive territory for the year, and the Dow industrials and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also rallied. So for at least one weekend, Wall Street's biggest concern is likely to be nothing more than the weather in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>All in all, the picture is pretty, said Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market strategist at Goldman Sachs. With the economy slowing a bit but earnings still strong, she thinks the S.&amp; P. 500 could hit 1,575 by the end of the year, a 5 percent gain. ''Second-quarter numbers have been quite good,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Agreed. But that is not the whole story. After all, the fundamentals were just as good three months ago, when the Nasdaq plunged into a sickening tailspin that pushed it from 5,000 to 3,300 in a matter of weeks, leaving many investors bruised and some broke.</p>
        <p>But during 1999 and early this year, the market, especially the Nasdaq, increasingly became a kind of casino, a speculative frenzy in which the performance of many stocks seemed almost entirely divorced from the reality of the companies behind them. That cognitive dissonance was most obvious in the market for initial public offerings: technology companies with no earnings, and in many cases no revenue, found investors desperate to buy their shares, which then rocketed higher on their first day of trading.</p>
        <p>So when the plunge came, nearly every professional money manager agreed that it was a necessary corrective. Necessary to remind investors that most stocks do not double or triple in a year. Necessary to prove that, as every investment textbook explains, high returns do not come without high risks. Necessary, most of all, because the capital markets are supposed to be a place where deserving companies get the money they need to grow, not a casino.</p>
        <p>Yet now the froth is beginning to rise again on Nasdaq stocks, which are up almost 30 percent from their lows of late May. Double-digit dollar swings are again becoming common. On Thursday, JDS Uniphase, the fast-growing fiber optics maker, soared $21, an increase of 20 percent, on the not particularly surprising news that the company would be added to the S.&amp; P. 500 index. On Friday, JDS gained an additional $6.875.</p>
        <p>The new-issue market, which slowed sharply in May and June, is heating up, too.  New companies are coming to market again, and 100 percent gains on the first day are again not uncommon.</p>
        <p>All this worries even some longtime bulls. ''As painful as the bear market was, it was absolutely necessary,'' said Bill Keithler, who manages the $9.3 billion Invesco Technology fund. ''We needed to shake out that kind of goofy speculation, and maybe it's not done.'' Like other pros, Mr. Keithler is not anxious for a return to the frenzy of last winter. ''I would like a more measured advance as well,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That's not surprising. It took a drop of 30 percent to convince speculators accustomed to a decade-long bull market that they are not bulletproof. If the Nasdaq reaches new highs and they are able to regain their losses in only a few months, they will have little incentive to think of the markets as anything but a casino.</p>
        <p>And then the next crash will really hurt.</p>
