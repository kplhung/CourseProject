        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed Ty Burr's overview of the films of Peter Greenaway [''Greenaway's Films: Hard Work, With Rewards,'' July 9]. My one quibble concerns Mr. Burr's curious omission of Mr. Greenaway's 1987 film, ''The Belly of an Architect.'' A loving tribute to, in equal parts, Rome's architecture and Brian Dennehy's girth, it is in some respects Mr. Greenaway's most captivating film. In it the director's luscious though austere formalism is coupled with a humanity and compassion that his other films notoriously lack, and whose absence renders them beautiful but cold. Mr. Dennehy's powerful and sometimes over-the-top performance gives ''Belly'' the emotional center that many feel great works of art must have, but which Mr. Greenaway, despite his other undoubted virtues, has often seemed uninterested in.</p>
