        <p>The 3-year-old filly Jostle found a new way to endure a distance race and outrun the championship ambitions of Secret Status yesterday at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Instead of leading with speed most of the way, as she did in the Mother Goose Stakes three weeks ago, when she finished second, she led all the way without speed this time. As a result, she had enough energy at the finish to upset the favored Secret Status in the $350,000 Coaching Club American Oaks.</p>
        <p>It actually was an old way to win a race, especially a long one like the mile-and-a-half Oaks. But who could have guessed that Pat Day would let Secret Status dawdle until it was too late to overcome the slow pace of Mike Smith aboard Jostle?</p>
        <p>At the end, with time and distance growing short, everybody turned on the speed. But Jostle, who won the Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico in May, breezed home by 3 1/4 lengths over Ogden Mills Phipps's Resort, who had three-quarters of a length on Secret Status in third</p>
        <p>So, the coronation of Secret Status as the champion 3-year-old filly was delayed. She looked ripe for the crown when she won the Florida Oaks, the Kentucky Oaks and the Mother Goose. Now she finds herself challenged by another candidate, Jostle, with another test booked for Aug. 19 in the mile-and-a-quarter Alabama at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>''The pace made all the difference,'' said John Servis, who trains Jostle for Fox Hill Farms. ''If she would have had an easier lead in her last race, she would have run better in that one, too. Jostle feels so good, she's squealing and kicking the wall in her stall at 5 a.m. She wants to be a racehorse.''</p>
        <p>Smith, who also rode Jostle when she ran out of speed in the Mother Goose, analyzed the equation this way: ''I know it sounds weird, but horses seem to be tougher on the lead when you're going 12 furlongs as opposed to 10. After you run a mile and an eighth, it's tough to come with a big run, and that's what played to our advantage.''</p>
        <p>Neil Howard, who trains Secret Status for Will Farish, said he doubted that the distance had slowed his filly or that she had ''bounced'' backward.</p>
        <p>''This was a tricky race,'' he said. ''Pat said she was doing it real easily, but I don't know if she's most comfortable being as close as she was to the front. I don't want to make any excuses, or use the B-word. And I wasn't worried about the distance, going in.'' He paused and took the long view, saying: ''This is the first and last time these fillies are likely to go a mile and a half. The jury is still out on them, but it's not out on Jostle anymore.''</p>
        <p>From the moment they sprang from the gate, Jostle took the lead, as she had been expected to do. But Secret Status, who usually closes with a winning kick, stayed on her heels for one mile through exceedingly slow fractions. They went half a mile in 492 5  seconds, and three-quarters of a mile in 1:15.</p>
        <p>And they were still 1-2 with no challenge from Secret Status. Then, with a quarter of a mile left, Resort moved up from deep in the pack to challenge for the lead, and Secret Status failed to answer Day's late call to action. The three crossed the wire followed by John Peace's Sound of the West in the field of seven.</p>
        <p>Jostle ran the mile and a half in 2:294 5 , paid $7.70 on a $2 bet to win as the second choice and earned $210,000.</p>
        <p>Day, the wily veteran whose judgment of pace helped Commendable win the Belmont Stakes at a mile an a half, reported: ''She was within striking range, but once Resort passed us, it was all over. I was scrubbing hard on the turn, and got no response. The pace didn't play to our advantage.''</p>
        <p>Edgar Prado, the jockey on Resort, put the race into perspective with these rueful words: ''I wish there was more speed to go and press the winner. At the top of the stretch, I thought my horse was going to go by, but the winner had a nice, easy lead and was tough.''</p>
