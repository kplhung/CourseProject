        <p>DURING the first six months of this year, a record amount of office space was leased in Westchester County and the vacancy rate dropped to its lowest point in more than a decade. The county,  benefiting from a lack of available space in surrounding markets, had an increase of 1.8 million square feet of leased space, a rate that was up 44 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Westchester's overall vacancy rate of 12.8 percent is down from 16.7 percent at the same time last year, according to Insignia/ ESG, the real-estate services company. ''That's the lowest it's been in the 12 years since we've been keeping records,'' said Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of Insignia/ESG's Westchester-Connecticut office in Stamford, Conn.</p>

        <p>DURING the first six months of this year, a record amount of office space was leased in Westchester County and the vacancy rate dropped to its lowest point in more than a decade. The county,  benefiting from a lack of available space in surrounding markets, had an increase of 1.8 million square feet of leased space, a rate that was up 44 percent from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Westchester's overall vacancy rate of 12.8 percent is down from 16.7 percent at the same time last year, according to Insignia/ ESG, the real-estate services company. ''That's the lowest it's been in the 12 years since we've been keeping records,'' said Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of Insignia/ESG's Westchester-Connecticut office in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>The positive trend was spearheaded by the improvement in the central business district of White Plains, which had 55 percent of all the space absorbed in the county, or a total of 609,700 square feet, for the first six months of this year.</p>
        <p>White Plains also had the largest lease of the year, signed by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, for 203,110 square feet at 1129 Westchester Avenue. The company, which now splits its headquarters between two other White Plains buildings, had seriously considered leaving the county, according to Mr. Shapiro.</p>
        <p>''They really looked hard elsewhere,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''but couldn't find the space they needed. The fact that they recommitted to Westchester and decided to expand here bodes very well.''</p>
        <p>Westchester, however, no longer has to count on such large leases to thrive, Mr. Shapiro said. For one thing, such large blocks of space, which used to be the bane of Westchester's market, are becoming less available, Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>At the end of June, only six blocks larger than 100,000 square feet, totaling 1.7 million square feet, remained available, according to Insignia/ESG, slightly more than half of the 3 million square feet in 13 units available at the same time last year.</p>
        <p>''The real story so far this year is the expansion of companies within the county,'' Mr. Shapiro said. Examples are an Internet trading company, TradeOut.com, which expanded to 60,000 square feet from 10,000;  Metromedia Fiber Network, which went to 79,650 square feet from 26,680, and Blue Sky Studios, which moved up to 42,571 square feet from 21,630.</p>
        <p>There were also some relocations from other markets, although that was far less of a factor in the county's fortunes this year. InSite Services moved from Manhattan to 42,571 square feet at 44 South Broadway in White Plains, and Greenwich Technology Partners moved from Greenwich, Conn., to 29,400 square feet at 123 Main Street in White Plains.</p>
        <p>''We're starting to see that reverse relocation now,'' said Frank Boccanfuso, a principal with FMB Real Estate Services, of White Plains. ''It used to be just the reverse. It was far more common to see companies moving to Connecticut from Westchester. But Greenwich Technology Partners looked in Stamford but couldn't find anything in their price range.''</p>
        <p>And companies moving to Westchester are now signing larger leases for longer terms, according to Kenneth M. Krasnow, a director with Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''This year, there have been a lot of healthy deals in the 30,000-to-50,000-square-foot range,''  Mr. Krasnow said. ''And they're signing leases for seven to 10 years.''</p>
        <p>White Plains, in particular, has attracted many Internet and telecom companies, Mr. Krasnow added. ''Those firms really dominate the Westchester market now, especially in White Plains,'' he said.</p>
        <p>T HE city has the fiber infrastructure that these companies want,'' Mr. Krasnow said. ''Technology is really what's important now. Amenities like fitness centers, concierges and the like aren't as important as they used to be. They're fine, but if a building doesn't have the technological infrastructure the rest doesn't matter.''</p>
        <p>White Plains still has some problems, however, such as large companies downsizing and returning large blocks of space to the market, but the impact is not as significant as it once was, Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>For instance, Prodigy Communications recently announced that as a result of its merger with SBC Communications, a Texas-based company, it would move its headquarters out of White Plains, vacating 84,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>''In the past, that would have been devastating to the market,'' Mr. Shapiro said.  ''But now it's almost a blessing. It provides  needed high-quality space that can be used by six or eight companies. And they could grow and eventually want more space, and that's better for the county in the long run.''</p>
        <p>Outside investors, who had shied away from Westchester, are now taking an interest, especially in White Plains. One recent example is the purchase of 75 South Broadway by Jeffrey Gural, chairman of Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, and the Benenson Capital Company, an investment firm based in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The two partners, which individually have an interest in several properties in Manhattan, formed a limited partnership to buy the 90,000-square-foot building, which is now 95 percent leased, for $10 million. ''We feel that Westchester is less of a risk now,'' Mr. Gural said. ''We wanted to diversify a bit, and with rents what they are in Manhattan, we needed to look elsewhere in order to find the right deal.''</p>
        <p>Average annual rents in White Plains are now in the mid to high $20's a square foot, according to Mr. Krasnow of Cushman &amp; Wakefield. ''I expect that they'll go to $35 a square foot by the end of the year,'' he said. ''And at that point we can start to expect some speculative building.''</p>
        <p>With asking rents for Class A space in Manhattan averaging around $75 a square foot, Mr. Krasnow added, ''Westchester still looks like a great deal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boccanfuso predicted that ''by year's end I expect that Westchester's vacancy rate will reach single digits,'' He added: 'It will match the level of Fairfield's, which is now around 7 percent. And White Plains's vacancy rate will reach around 10 or 11 percent. For that to happen, White Plains just needs to absorb around 250,000 square feet. And that's easily attainable.''</p>
