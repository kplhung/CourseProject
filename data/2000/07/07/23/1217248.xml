        <p>A plan that could have led to the breaching of four dams on the Snake River in the Pacific Northwest has been postponed. The plan was aimed at easing the way for endangered species of salmon to return to spawning grounds. But the White House chose instead to embrace an alternative course. Trying to balance voters' support for the salmon with regional officials' opposition to any breach, it will propose smaller steps to help the species while deferring until at least 2005 any razing of the dams.</p>
