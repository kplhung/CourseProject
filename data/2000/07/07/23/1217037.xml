        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Some years ago our local paper printed an article on a program in which toughened prisoners appeared before schoolchildren to warn of the horror and brutality that awaited those who land in prison. It occurred to me then, as it did when I read your article, that no one seemed puzzled by the history of these inmates. A term in prison had not scared them straight. They were repeat offenders. Why expect them to influence their audience?</p>
