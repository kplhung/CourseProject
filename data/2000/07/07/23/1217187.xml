        <p>The peace teams at the Camp David summit meeting moved into a waiting-for-President-Clinton mode today as the Jewish Sabbath imposed an informal day of small group discussions.</p>
        <p>American officials, who have honored a strict news blackout, did not even divulge the daily schedule or menu today. It remained unclear whether progress has been made in Mr. Clinton's absence, or whether he will return to face the same key dispute over Jerusalem's sovereignty and whether that dispute still holds the power to shut down the open-ended meeting without any resolution.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, indirectly through confidants, and President Clinton, directly to reporters, both expressed hope that the meeting could produce an agreement, which suggested that the impasse had been broken.</p>
        <p>But from Egypt, a spokesman for President Hosni Mubarak, whom all three leaders have consulted during their days here, said that the situation inside had deteriorated since Mr. Clinton's departure, with the Israelis demonstrating inflexibility.</p>
        <p>''Let's wait until Clinton comes back,'' said Maged Abdel Fattah, the spokesman. He said that he was not sure whether the Egyptian president had played a role in extending the meeting, which was pronounced dead and then reborn within the space of an hour and a half late Wednesday night. Mr. Mubarak had been asked to help and he was trying, the spokesman said. In his phone call with President Clinton on Wednesday, the conversation focused on Jerusalem and specifically ''on ways and means to convince Chairman Arafat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But President Mubarak stressed that Jerusalem is the core issue in this whole conference,'' Mr. Abdel Fattah said. ''The issues of refugees and the percentage of land are issues that, with some compromise, will fall into place.''</p>
        <p>The Israelis have reportedly softened their position to consider extending limited or joint sovereignty to the Palestinians in some Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem, while leaving the status quo frozen in the walled Old City, home to Christians, Muslims, Jews and holy sites for all three monotheistic faiths.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat has insisted repeatedly that he does not have a mandate from the Arab world to do anything less than regain sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>A senior Palestinian official said that the status of Jerusalem must be resolved for there to be an agreement. Mr. Barak, too, disfavors a partial deal that leaves aside any issues. He wants nothing less than to resolve conclusively the Israeli-Palestinian conflict of 52 years, so that the finality of the deal will generate an excitement that will help Israelis swallow the necessary concessions.</p>
