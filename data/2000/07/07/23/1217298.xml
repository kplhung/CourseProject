        <p>KARSKI-Jan, Dr. The American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust survivors deeply mourns the passing away of Dr. Jan Karski at age 86 in Washington, D.C. He will forever be known as the courageous ''man who tried to stop the Holocaust''. In 1942, at the risk of losing his life, Jan Karski, having escaped German torture and imprisonment for being a member of the Polish underground, delivered messages to the Western World (including President Franklin D. Roosevelt) and presented evidence he had gathered on the horrors of Nazi atrocities being committed, the ongoing extermination of the Jews in Poland and details of Hitler's Final Solution. To his great dismay, nobody believed him. After the war, he refused to return to Poland, and made the U.S. his home. He was made an Honorary Citizen of the State of Israel. In Jerusalem a tree bearing his name has been planted in the Alley of the Righteous Gentiles Among the Nations. The world has lost a truly great human being and we have lost a friend. Benjamin Meed, President Roman Kent, Chairman</p>
