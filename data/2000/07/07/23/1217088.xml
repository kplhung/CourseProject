        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As director of Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School, I greatly enjoyed ''Little Red Radicals'' (June 25). However, I would like to correct what might be a misperception, stemming from the article, about the school today. I was quoted as saying our students are less impassioned than once they were and more concerned with academic pursuits and critical thinking than with political positions. This, while true in some respects, does not fairly reflect the high degree of passion and political activism throughout our school community in pursuit of justice and inclusion.</p>
        <p>This year, for example, we organized a conference series for teachers and parents of many schools that defined an intellectual and practical ground for working against all kinds of bias; our students put together an extraordinary series of assemblies during Black History Month; they also ran a students-of-color mentoring program in our middle and high schools; and much work on inclusion was done in constant meetings and discussions by 4-year-olds through 12th graders.</p>

        <p>One of our students has played a major recent role as a member of the National Council of the United Methodist Church in fighting bias against lesbians and gays. Our school in general, and our Lesbian and Gay Issues Committee in particular has been active in this regard. In an institution founded by Elisabeth Irwin, herself a declared lesbian, this seems particularly in keeping with our historic commitment to social justice and individual freedom.</p>
