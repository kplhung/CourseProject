        <p>On one side stands a teary-eyed Russian couple whose Brooklyn community has vowed to go to any length to help them keep their adopted pet monkey. On the other side is an adamant state government backed by a host of monkey experts and the power of the endangered-species law.</p>
        <p>In the middle, oblivious to all the fuss, stands Cookie Flikshtein, a rare diana monkey who is living the good life, eating Rocky Road ice cream and wearing frilly red miniskirts, while her fate is being decided.</p>
        <p>Just weeks after the conclusion of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle comes an even stranger scuffle over little Cookie, age 6. Her adoptive parents, Roman and Inna Flikshtein, have argued unsuccessfully in court that there is no better place for Cookie than their monkey-friendly home. The state attorney general's office, meanwhile, maintains that Cookie is a member of an endangered species and belongs in a special animal rescue program at the Detroit Zoo.</p>
        <p>There are no immediate plans to wrest Cookie from the Flikshtein home, where she has lived for five years in such familial bliss that 13-year-old Michelle Flikshtein refers to the monkey as her sister. But the Flikshtein's neighbors, many of whom are recent immigrants from Russia, have closed ranks, promising to protect young Cookie until the end.</p>
        <p>''We're going to sit here and not let people come near,'' said Lubov Gruber, who lives down the block. ''We will protest this for as long as it takes.''</p>
