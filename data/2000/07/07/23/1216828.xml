        <p>House of Invention</p>
        <p>The Secret Life of Everyday Products.</p>
        <p>By David Lindsay.</p>
        <p>Lyons, $22.95.</p>
        <p>The cast of characters in ''House of Invention'' ranges from the backless brassiere to the pencil -- items so frequently used that many consumers find them thoroughly unremarkable. David Lindsay, the author of ''The Patent Files,'' is not among them. He animatedly sketches the histories of products, from the blender to the condom, that he contends represent not just ''victory over disorder'' but over ''the whole spectrum of disasters, flukes and oversized gestures we call the human folly.'' The inventor of Vaseline, Robert Chesebrough, was so persuaded of the curative powers of petroleum jelly that he ate a spoonful of it nearly every day. King Camp Gillette, father of the disposable razor, believed with such conviction in his utopian ideas -- among them that the world's population should up and move to Texas -- that he sold his lucrative business in order to promote them full time. The country's first female self-made millionaire, C. J. Walker, was raised among sharecroppers and started building her cosmetics empire by mixing hair straightening tonics in her washtub. Not all the accounts in ''House of Invention'' are equally engaging. Some, like those regarding the origins of paper money, the standard screw thread and solitaire, ramble. These are the minority, and even in the rougher chapters nuggets of information sparkle. For the most part, the color in Lindsay's small book far outweighs its deficits, making it a delightful, instructive collection.</p>
