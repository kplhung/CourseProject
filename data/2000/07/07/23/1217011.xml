        <p>Pharmaceuticals are a risky, but lucrative, business. Drug companies turn scientific advances into life-saving medicines that can generate millions of dollars in sales each day, but the process takes time -- an average of 12 to 15 years -- and money.</p>
        <p>Through a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, the prescription drug industry is increasingly global. But the companies earn most of their profits, and do most of their basic research, in the United States, the last drug market free of price restraints. The industry consistently ranks as the most profitable among Fortune 500 companies.</p>
        <p>In this election year, with prescription drugs now the fastest-growing component of the nation's health care bill, the political debate is centered on how to help elderly people pay for their medications. So politicians and consumers are taking a close look at the drug industry, a business that closely guards its financial and scientific secrets.</p>
        <p>Drug Discovery</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical companies spend more than $20 billion annually on research and development, a figure that has nearly doubled every five years since 1970, according to industry data. The industry estimates that the average cost of developing a successful drug is more than $500 million.</p>
        <p>The actual cost of developing a particular medicine -- the laboratory equipment, the raw materials, the researchers' salaries, the clinical trials -- is just a small percentage of the $500 million. The rest is the cost of lost opportunity: years and dollars spent on scientific leads that prove fruitless, and research money that could have generated interest had it been invested elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The $500 million figure is extrapolated from a 1991 study by researchers at Tufts University. Some experts say the estimate, drawn from confidential industry data not subject to outside review, is inflated.</p>
        <p>Companies spend more on drug development -- the D in R &amp; D -- than they do on research. While clinical trials account for the biggest development expense, experts say some development costs, like consulting fees paid to doctors, are more appropriately categorized as marketing than research.</p>
        <p>Clinical Testing</p>
        <p>For every 5,000 to 10,000 compounds the industry screens as potential new medicines, 250 make it to the stage of testing in animals. Of these, the industry says, five enter testing in people, in clinical trials.</p>
        <p>The trials have three phases. First, the drug is given to a small number of healthy volunteers to test its safety and establish the proper dose. The second trial tests for effectiveness and looks for side effects in a larger number of patients who have the condition the drug is meant to treat.</p>
        <p>The costliest clinical trial is the Phase 3 study, in which thousands of patients may be tested, so that scientists can assess the drug in a diverse population, over an extended period. Depending on the drug and the amount of medical care involved, experts say, a Phase 3 clinical trial can cost $10,000 to $20,000 a patient.</p>
        <p>The Regulators</p>
        <p>For years the drug makers complained that the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency that regulates medication, took too long to approve new treatments, eating into the valuable life of a patent. That changed in 1992 when Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled the agency to speed drug reviews with the help of industry money.</p>
        <p>Between 1992 and 1997, the industry paid the agency $327 million to hire 600 new reviewers. Today, the average drug approval time has dropped to 12 months, from about 30 months before the law was passed. And the number of new medicines the agency approves each year is rising.</p>
        <p>But critics say that in relying on drug companies to supplement its budget, the F.D.A. has become too close to the industry. They point to a rash of drugs withdrawn in recent years after serious side effects surfaced once the drugs were in pharmacies.</p>
        <p>Patenting</p>
        <p>Patents, as much as science, are critical to the success of a new drug. A patent is a property right. It confers a government-authorized monopoly for a set period -- in the United States, 20 years from the date the application is filed. During this period of market exclusivity, the patent owner can recover the costs of its original investment.</p>
        <p>Patents were not always of paramount importance in medical research; many academic scientists once believed that knowledge should not be treated as proprietary. After Jonas Salk invented a polio vaccine, the journalist Edward R. Murrow asked him who owned the patent. ''There is no patent,'' Dr. Salk replied. ''Could you patent the sun?''</p>
        <p>And when a Rutgers University professor, Selman Waksman, invented a breakthrough antibiotic, streptomycin, in the 1940's, he patented the drug, but gave away the rights. The result: many companies sold streptomycin, keeping prices -- and profits -- low.</p>
        <p>The picture is far different today. Drug companies often derive the bulk of their sales from a handful of top-selling medications, so the pressure to invent the next blockbuster, and maximize its time under patent, is intense. In the industry, this is known as ''life-cycle protection''; one way the drug makers protect their products is simply to file more patents.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. keeps a registry of all drug patents. But the agency does not evaluate whether the patents are valid; it simply takes the company's word. So the listing creates a barrier to rivals, which often wind up challenging patents in court.</p>
        <p>Drug companies have also fought hard to win patent extensions. In 1995, an international trade agreement pushed back the expiration date of patents. Several companies benefited handsomely from a loophole in that extension.</p>
        <p>While drug makers say they need longer patent protection to generate profits for research, some experts say that patent expirations, not extensions, spur innovation. Eli Lilly &amp; Company, for instance, is pursuing new antidepressants now that the patent on its best seller, Prozac, is about to run out.</p>
        <p>''The Prozac patent expiration,'' the company's 1998 annual report said, ''is serving as a catalyst to bring greater intensity to everything we do.''</p>
        <p>Generic Competition</p>
        <p>Prozac is not the only blockbuster drug threatened by the loss of its patent. In the next five years patents are due to expire on some of the most lucrative drugs in the history of medicine, among them Prilosec, the ulcer medication; Claritin, for allergies; and Zocor, for high cholesterol.</p>
        <p>Generics can erode a brand drug's market share within months. A 1999 report by the Boston Consulting Group, which advises the industry, predicted that the average top drug company would lose 30 percent of its sales to generics by 2003.</p>
        <p>If the threat of generics creates angst on Wall Street about the industry's profitability, it creates even more inside the companies, where scientists, patent lawyers and business executives are taking a variety of steps to beat back competition.</p>
        <p>When a drug produced by a joint venture of Dupont and Merck, the blood thinner Coumadin, faced a generic challenge, the companies hired a battery of lobbyists to press state legislators and pharmacy boards to adopt rules that, in effect, restricted the ability of pharmacists to substitute the generic for the brand drug.</p>
        <p>Claritin's maker, Schering-Plough, has taken its lobbying efforts to Washington; it has asked Congress to insert a provision into a spending bill that would extend the drug's patent.</p>
        <p>When generic makers tried to sell a version of Taxol, a leading breast cancer drug, Taxol's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, sued for patent infringement -- not on the drug, but on the method of delivery, which the company had also patented. Courts in Britain and this country found for the generics earlier this year, but the case is on appeal and there is still no generic on the market.</p>
        <p>Fewer than 20 percent of all prescriptions were filled with generic drugs in 1984. That year Congress passed a landmark law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, intended to facilitate generic competition. By 1996 generics had captured 43 percent of the market and were saving consumers $8 billion to $10 billion annually, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
        <p>But because generics cost much less than brand drugs, they account for only a small fraction of the industry's total sales. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the combined prescription sales of the top 20 generic drug makers in 1998 totaled $7 billion, less than a tenth of those of the top 20 brand companies.</p>
        <p>Coming to Market</p>
        <p>The United States is the last free market for pharmaceuticals: other developed nations control drug prices, as in Japan, Canada, and France, or drug company profits, as in England. So Americans typically pay higher prices for new medications than people anywhere else in the developed world.</p>
        <p>How the drug companies set prices, though, remains something of a mystery; they do not discuss their pricing strategies. The drug makers say price is dictated by the high cost of research. But the calculus behind any single pricing decision is complex, and largely shaped by market forces.</p>
        <p>Does the new drug offer therapeutic advantages over existing medicines? How big is the patient population? Is there generic competition? Paradoxically, the arrival of generic competition often results in raised prices for their brand-name counterparts, as companies seek to maximize revenue in a shrinking market.</p>
        <p>And despite the industry's emphasis on R &amp; D costs, the top drug makers in 1998 spent, as a percentage of sales, three times as much on marketing and general and administrative expenses as they did on research and development, the Kaiser Family Foundation said.</p>
        <p>There is no set price for a single drug in the United States: health plans, the government and individual patients all pay different rates, depending on their power in the marketplace. More than three-quarters of Americans younger than 65 have prescription drug coverage; their insurers typically negotiate discounts. But the size of those discounts is kept secret.</p>
        <p>Among elderly Americans, who account for 13 percent of the population but roughly one-third of all drug expenditures, it is a different story. One-third of the nation's senior citizens lack drug insurance, and must pay out of pocket for their pills. As a result, they typically pay the highest prices.</p>
