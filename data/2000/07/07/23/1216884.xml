        <p>Meanwhile, Adam Phillips, whose DNA strands should be studied by medical science for the key to higher intelligence, has come out with ''Darwin's Worms'' (Free Press), a book about the parallels between Darwin's thinking and Freud's. Add the popularity of ''Survivor,'' top it with the mapping of the human genome, and you have something more than hula-hoops. You have survival of the fittest hula-hoops.</p>
        <p>Computer technology is rapidly changing the environment for architects as well as for businesses and nations. How are they adapting to it? In what form will architecture survive?</p>
        <p>The Venice Biennale's Seventh International Architecture Exhibition, which opened last month and runs through Oct. 29, is right in step with these evolutionary times. It features the latest strain to emerge in architecture in recent years: ''blob'' design, so-called, produced with the aid of computer animation software. Biomorphic and invertebrate, with seldom a trace of the T-squares most architects long ago abandoned, blobs look like things you would expect to see rising from an electronic version of the primordial ooze. As if to signal the origin of a species, previously lurking in the depths of the Lagoon, the Biennale rounds up blob projects by Greg Lynn, Lars Spuybroek, Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, Jesse Reiser and Uneko Umamoto, Hani Rashid and Lise Ann Couture, and other pixel prodigies. Lynn, in particular, was ubiquitous. It was trilobytes, trilobytes, everywhere you turned.</p>
        <p>Venice is an ideal setting for examining architecture in Darwinian terms. The city is a pageant of survival and adaptation, of triumphant resistance to climate, conquest and time. Even in Ruskin's day, Venice was an inhabited skeleton. The city's economic and military power had mutated into a pink and gray romance. Its more recent rebirth as a center of art and tourism prefigured the transformation now taking place in cities throughout the post-industrial world.</p>
        <p>Architecture, too, has lately come to resemble the inhabited shell of an extinct beast. Architects are heirs to the heroic tradition of pyramids, temples and cathedrals. Yet many of the most talented among them are lucky if they are hired to design a loft. There has never been more building in the world, nor a lower ratio of architecture to junk. Architects now are day-trippers in their own domain.</p>
        <p>This year's Biennale should lift their spirits. Usually, this event is the poor, abject cousin of the Art Biennale, the glitzy career fest with which it alternates every other year. This year feels different. The European press turned out. The cameras and notepads seemed to confirm architecture's increasing prominence on the cultural map. Compared with the Art Biennale, it remains an event where ideas matter more than dollars. It appears that in the year 2000, a certain cachet has attached itself to ideas. People may be awakening to the fact that it takes ideas, as well as money, for great cities to survive.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Roman architect Massimiliano Fuksas, this year's Biennale is called ''The City: Less Esthetics, More Ethics.'' New Yorkers may find it hard to get behind this proposition. Unless theme park lampposts are your idea of frisky urban design, it will probably not occur to you that New York is suffering from aesthetic overload. Fortunately, the show contradicts its theme at every turn. Congestion, pollution, urban decay, homelessness, even xenophobia and racial intolerance -- social conscience here gets the high art treatment. Welcome to Italy, where every fashion editor carries a Marxist membership card in her Prada purse.</p>
        <p>Ethics are wearing bright colors this season. That's the fashion message at the Italian pavilion, the main attraction in the village of national pavilions laid out in the Giardini, the city's public gardens. Visitors enter through a gantlet of monitors displaying famous talking-head architects shot against vivid pink, orange, green and blue electronic backgrounds. The heads look so aged against the pop-up video colors. They must be addressing issues of great ethical import. Never mind. The volume is too low to hear them.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in the Arsenale, the ancient naval yard where Venice launched the ships that patrolled her maritime empire, there stretches an immense video wall, two stories high and several football fields long, representing la Citta. To a snappy soundtrack, streaming video images hurtle by -- scenes from the global metropolis projected by cameras stationed in two dozen cities. Crowds wait at Asian intersections to cross streets bathed in neon. Trains whoosh past shantytowns. Night falls over a nameless skyline. Waves crash. Desert dunes billow. Heaven knows how these natural features got into the city. The idea must be that the city is getting into them.</p>
        <p>I went to Venice with a question in mind. There are now two generations of architects below the age of 50. Are they developing new forms of practice?</p>
        <p>Ours is not an era when the government, private patrons, professional organizations or the press can provide architects with cultural connective tissue or unite them behind common causes. In the cities, our most talented architects are spinning freely within professional vacuums of their own devising. Their ethic is that of shipwrecks: every office for itself. No wonder architects have been so ineffectual in confronting the pressures of global urbanization. To reckon with the monoculture, the shape of practices will have to change more radically than the shape of buildings. Flexible working relationships must be built across geographic and corporate borders. At least, I see no other way out of the present moral impasse.</p>
        <p>The national pavilions are signposts pointed in the wrong direction. It feels so dated, in the era of mass tourism, the Internet and the E.E.C., to wander through this display. Fortunately, nationalism is not a major problem afflicting architecture today. Jet lag is a bigger issue. Architects spend as much time on planes as State Department envoys. Their far-flung projects are agents of cross-cultural fertilization.</p>
        <p>This idea was evident throughout the Biennale, but nowhere more clearly than in the Austrian Pavilion, of all places. Organized by Hans Hollein, the presentation focused on Vienna but highlighted recent work by non-Austrian architects, including Zaha Hadid, Greg Lynn, Peter Cook and Colin Fournier. An elegant installation in dove gray, white and black, the exhibition included a large map of project sites. The map conveyed the message that cities can foster solidarity among architects, not only in matters of style, but also in resistance to stupidity.</p>
        <p>The message was clearly aimed at the nationalists among us. It was even more explicit in a separate gallery, an ''Area of Tolerance,'' that presented architect-designed agitprop posters attacking Austria's Jorg Haider and his anti-immigration policies. But the main part of the show offered a more lasting polemic. With graceful understatement, it suggested that city lovers are an embattled species. We have more in common with one another than with the rest of our respective nations. The ethical fiber that binds us is the cosmopolitan belief that the function of a city is to refuse everything less than the best.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, Hollein has contributed a project of his own design. ''Dencity'' is a floating raft that holds a contemplative garden inspired by Ryoanji, Kyoto's celebrated temple garden of rock and sand . East and West, war and peace, water and land: these surrealist juxtapositions compose a haunting meditation on the architect's role in a shrinking globe.</p>
        <p>The German show is shocking. The exhibition focuses on Berlin, logical for the first Biennale held since the government returned there. The theme is the capital's transformation over the last catastrophic century. One gallery displays huge black and white street maps that track the city's development at 10-year intervals. In the second gallery, we segue smoothly from moral neutrality to moral equivalency. The wall is hung with photographs of Berlin landmarks as they are transformed or destroyed, by wars hot and cold. Captions are limited to name, address and year. This presentation confuses chronology with history. The result is that history is brutalized.</p>
        <p>IF I hadn't known that Arata Isozaki was the Japan Pavilion's commissioner, I would have thought the project on view there was the handiwork of Madame Butterfly's marriage broker. Titled ''City of Girls,'' the project was organized by Kazuko Koike and designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. The theme is gender. Specifically, it presents the Japanese adolescent female as a model of sensibility for the 21st-century city. The architects see her as a figure not yet fully indoctrinated by cultural tradition. Her response to beauty and ugliness is visceral.</p>
        <p>To Western eyes, the display looks as dubious as it sounds. The entire pavilion, and a large swath of the garden around it, has been whitewashed, including the trunks of trees. The floor, on several levels, is lined with white gravel. It is noisy and hard to walk on. A square of gravel is planted with rows of tiny plastic daisies. Very cute. A second square has been excised from the floor, creating a well you can peer into. People walk around down there beneath a cantilevered section of the building. Ahh. From the ceiling hangs an overcoat, titled ''Mother,'' designed by Kosuke Tsumura for homeless women. Oh! Oh!</p>
        <p>But this work does not fit neatly into Western grids of comprehension. I enjoyed the mixture of sentimentality and sophistication, but felt that I was missing a lot, as you do when you travel to any foreign city. In the era of monocultural familiarity, that sense of strangeness is not only to be savored but also to be trusted.</p>
        <p>My favorite work is a perfectly straightforward rendition of the Biennale's theme. Designed by two young Finnish architects, it is a small floating park set within the cargo hold of a rusting freight barge. Moored off the quay of the Arsenale, the barge is partly filled with the city's sludge (the effluent has been treated and doesn't stink). The sludge is covered with a thick layer of gravel, from which rises a small stand of oaks. The leaf crowns are partly visible from the quay, but you can't see the park itself until you climb a gangway to the deck of the barge. From there, you descend another gangway into the trees. Benches line the sides of the barge. A crane, looming above like an enormous sculpture, heightens the serenity of the place. The key to the project is the relationship between two exterior spaces, one enclosed by walls, the second given scale by the crane.</p>
        <p>The project retrieves the modern concept of the architect as problem solver. You can see it as a prototype for a community garden on an industrial waterfront, but what is mainly on view is an intelligence that can be applied to different conditions. The fusion of public space, sustainability and visual imagery can take many forms.</p>
        <p>Heightened awareness can be ethics enough. This is the moral foundation of Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio's work. They build on it here with a project displayed at the show of international work at the Italian pavilion. ''Pageant'' is a seven-minute computer animation loop on corporate logos. Using black figures on a white field, the loop lines up the icons of the usual monocultural suspects: Disney, Nike, Baby Bells, Texaco, Shell, McDonald's.</p>
        <p>This, too, could be considered an example of blob design, as each logo morphs into the next, an endlessly mutable contrast in black and white, signifying nothing. Of course, the power of this nothingness is immense and growing. What ultimately won't be branded? It is astounding to recognize how much nothing we now hold in our heads. The consumerist blob is inside us, competing for market share.</p>
        <p>ArchLab, the offering at the United States Pavilion, raises the ghost of the Ugly American, that figure of cold war fun. Members of the European press, among others, have interpreted the show's massive deployment of computer technology as a flashy display of imperial power in the post-cold war era. No doubt computer and military hardware are equivalent on some plane. But I saw the ArchLab as an urbanist, not a nationalist manifestation.</p>
        <p>Organized by Max Hollein, Hans Hollein's son and a senior staff member of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, the project brought together students and faculty from two architecture schools, Columbia University and U.C.L.A. The two groups were assigned different wings in the pavilion, a red brick kiosk of Jeffersonian aspirations, where they worked for four weeks in full public view.</p>
        <p>John Hockenberry, the NBC correspondent, was quoted recently in Sony Style on the difference between real innovation and technological illusion: ''Innovation changes lives; illusion offers empty promises.'' Perhaps architecture schools can't afford to patrol the line between innovation and illusion too fiercely. Thought cops could inhibit freedom of research. But the laxity creates an environment in which many illusionists come to believe that they're actually sawing the lady in half.</p>
        <p>Hani Rashid, the team director of the Columbia group, has been working the hocus-pocus angle for some time. With his partner in the New York-based Studio Asymptote, Lise Ann Couture, he has cornered a modest niche as a maker of hybrid designs that supposedly fuse architecture with computer technology. As I see it, the only fusion going on here is the old one of smoke and mirrors.</p>
        <p>On one monitor, a stick figure gymnast tumbles toward the viewer, morphing the surrounding space into gray ripples. This is supposed to signify the advent of Moving Man, a contemporary replacement of Vitruvian Man, the measure of all things classical. But what we actually saw was a classical, axial cartoon with wavy-gravy walls. Computers could be an invaluable tool for exploring the kinesthetic sense, but this project didn't scratch the surface. The visuals were sexy but vapid.</p>
        <p>Another room contained a giant pipe cleaner construction, executed in glowing blue wires. You couldn't get inside it. The wires, which were rigid, were supported by grids of transparent fishing line. I asked Rashid about the grid. I thought the point of using this software was to get away from grids. ''This is the grid in a computer model. It shows what it would be like if you were inside the screen.'' But in a computer model, the grids are curved. And if we were inside the screen, we would be inside the model. ''That's a technical limitation.'' Perhaps. But it's a limitation that others, like the Ocean group from Scandinavia, have got beyond. Also, this model doesn't move. ''But it does. See? It vibrates against the blue background. It draws on the tradition of Op Art.'' Oh. Silly of me not to notice that.</p>
        <p>Rashid is a very talented fellow. And I don't doubt that one day we'll all be spending lots of time in virtual space. What's missing here is a sense of real, historical time. Cities are still social condensers. Bodies still require bricks and mortar structures. If they don't concentrate on developing new forms in the material city, today's architecture students could end up as low-level technical consultants at Industrial Light and Magic.</p>
        <p>Greg Lynn, who led the U.C.L.A. team, is not yet an innovator. He has still to make the major breakthrough many in the architecture world are expecting of him. But Lynn's experiments with software-driven design are more than technological illusion. U.C.L.A.'s presentation, titled ''The Embryonic House,'' was the more solid -- and Darwinian -- of the two.</p>
        <p>Lynn's assignment was simple: be fruitful and multiply. Using Alias Wavefront's Maya software program, the students produced an open-ended essay on the theme of abundance. Given guidelines for a single-family dwelling, their task was to develop variations. The complex, curvilinear computer images they produced were sent to an adjacent model shop where a jig-saw cut them into wood and plastic modules. These were then fashioned into scale models and displayed, along with the modules and computer renderings, in a gallery. The purpose of this exercise is to transfer the blob from the still largely virtual to the physical.</p>
        <p>RUSKIN would have loved this. So, I suspect, would Paco Rabanne. One of the designs on view recalls Rabanne's metal disc dresses from the 1960's. It lacked only a fluorescent Dynel wig and a splash of Metal to complete the retro ensemble. And you didn't have to be told that it was in the Pop Tart tradition. But this was a Platonic performance. Ambition was within shouting distance of achievement. Lynn pushed the students to venture further than he has gone in his own work.</p>
        <p>It has been said that despite the emphasis on variation, blob designs all look the same, and that blob designers haven't fully reckoned with the realities of construction. I see this work as a genuine mutation, a natural response to the displacement of bricks and mortar by virtual space. It is not possible, at this point, to know where this response might lead. But Lynn is encouraging his students to emulate nature: to throw a bunch of combinations out there with the expectation that some of them will survive and mutate further in an environment that is also rapidly evolving.</p>
        <p>ArchLab's format was a mutation itself. I can't recall a presentation that placed greater emphasis on process, not to mention one that incorporated architects into the display. I didn't see the interaction I had hoped for between the East and West Coast teams. Each kept pretty much to its own game. Still, the latent competition between Rashid and Lynn underscored the idea that New York and Los Angeles had volved into the east and west sides of a single metropolitan condition.</p>
        <p>The Biennale's strongest message is that this interurban linkage will accelerate at the global level. A struggle has already emerged between large corporate offices and independent ''star'' architects, operating as independent contractors with skeletal staffs, who are available for hire much like actors or choreographers. The star system is not going to wither away. There will be more and more stars. They could become a counterculture to the monoculture, or they could become the icing on its cake. Enlightened clients will hire them. What they will bring to the table is risk. Risk is their brand. Clients will demand the brand as they recognize that risk is a more valuable commodity than safety, even in purely commercial terms. The blob may turn out to be more significant as a metaphor for this development -- a logo for risk -- than for the formal qualities of blob designs.</p>
        <p>That is the first answer to the question I took to Venice. (An extended treatment of these concepts can be found in Ben Van Berkel and Caroline Bos's book ''Move,'' a manifesto published last year by UN Studio and Goose Press.) A second was suggested by a Venetian friend, Franca Coin. Ms. Coin is president of the Venetian Foundation, the outfit that runs most of the city's major museums. She lives in the Palazzo Barbaro, a Grand Canal mansion of fabled cosmopolitan pedigree. Henry James stayed there for five weeks in 1887, and later used it as the setting for ''The Wings of the Dove.'' I ran into her a few hours after she'd paid a visit to the United States Pavilion.</p>
        <p>''They're here! They're here!'' she exclaimed, with a look of delight. I assumed she was referring to the pavilion's new breed of wired-up, net-surfing artists, more talked about than seen in a rear-view mirror city like Venice. Ms. Coin was talking about that, in part. But she was more impressed by the ethnic diversity of the students: not just that one was black, or another Asian, but that she couldn't tell, just from looking at them, what their racial ancestry was.</p>
        <p>I would have overlooked this if my friend hadn't mentioned it. New Yorkers are supposed to take racial diversity for granted. We tend to think it's racist to take note of someone's race. But there are times when overlooking race amounts to denying reality, including one's own.</p>
        <p>Returning to New York, I ran into Ms. Coin at the airport. She was off to Greece. I noticed that she had taken the names and phone numbers of some of the students. She said she wanted to invite them to lunch when she got back. ''We are starved for conversation about today,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So are we, it struck me, as I headed to the gate. In New York, the conversation about today -- about architecture, about race, about contemporaneity itself -- has been squelched since the 70's, never more brutally than in the past seven years, as the reactionaries have dug in their heels. This has been suicidal as well as unjust. Diversity is the greatest asset of cities worldwide as well as the common thread between us. More ethics. More aesthetics. More genetics. The splicing of these strands will continue well beyond the Biennale.</p>
