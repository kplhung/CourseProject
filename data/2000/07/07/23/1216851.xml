        <p>THE proprietors of Bailey's Backyard in Ridgefield have done about as much as they can to decorate tiny storefront space attractively, even using white picket fencing along each pale taupe-painted wall to suggest al fresco dining.

        <p>THE proprietors of Bailey's Backyard in Ridgefield have done about as much as they can to decorate tiny storefront space attractively, even using white picket fencing along each pale taupe-painted wall to suggest al fresco dining. (Actually there are a couple of tables outdoors facing the street.)</p>
        <p>The American-style dinner menu augured well, though we wondered how so many different dishes (about a dozen entrees) with diverse ingredients could be prepared in what looked to be a small kitchen. But the big question for diners was how well they could do it.</p>
        <p>Very well indeed was our first reaction, when a plate of good crusty bread arrived, along with aromatic olive oil, amplified by a zesty dip of sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and rosemary.</p>
        <p>Among a quartet of appetizers we were especially pleased with the stuffed marinated portobello mushroom (served with mixed greens in a tease of balsamic vinaigrette), and tempura shrimp (embraced by a light batter, fried and accompanied by a zingy papaya-ginger dipping sauce).</p>
        <p>Crispy crawfish cakes, a welcome variation on crab cakes, were very tasty with a generous crawfish presence, despite an excess of breading. The two lightly browned cakes, with tops embroidered by swirls of Creole remoulade sauce, sat on a bed of greens without dressing. A more serious omission, in our view, was in the Southwestern spicy Caesar salad. Though the romaine lettuce leaves were crispy fresh and well-trimmed and the croutons toasty, two key elements were missing: anchovies (apparently banished from most Caesar salads these days) and chipotle (not a whisper of the dried, smoked chile could be detected).</p>
        <p>Entrees were a mixed bag. Louisiana grilled shrimp and chorizo, served over red beans and rice, along with braised spinach, proved a winning alliance; the sausage was unusually spicy and satisfying. A variation of this dish was also a lunchtime hit, with a chunk of chorizo skewered into each jumbo shrimp as a base.</p>
        <p>Our spiced pork medallions were flavorful and generous in size, but the real star of this ensemble (which also included mashed potatoes) was the sensational sweet-sour rhubarb-cherry chutney that accompanied it. This tangy number stole the show, so good it should be bottled and sold.</p>
        <p>We also enjoyed the well-cooked New Zealand grilled rack of lamb, but the excellent chops were undermined by undercooked goat cheese ravioli (admirable filling, but rubbery pasta).</p>
        <p>One entree was a fiasco of proportions we haven't experienced at a restaurant in years. The Southern roasted barbecue duck (two large legs and thighs) was so tough (not chewy; tough, tough, tough) that our knife had difficulty breaking the skin. One glance inside and we beckoned the waiter: the interior was bloody and raw. The waiter whisked it away, but when it was returned a few minutes later, it was still one tough bird, almost impossible to penetrate with a knife. The accompanying black-eyed peas (dry), green beans and hush puppies (light, golden and bite-size) couldn't compensate for a disastrous dish.</p>
        <p>What better antidote to a ruined course than some comfort food? We found it at lunch with the baked Vermont Cheddar cheese and macaroni, a large casserole bubbling hot, filled to the brim with bead-like ditalini pasta in a cheese-creamy sauce with a crunchy melted Cheddar seal.</p>
        <p>Most desserts were out-and-out delicious. Especially so was chocolate explosion: dark chocolate cake layered with outrageously rich fudge and sidecars of house-whipped cream. Chocolate raspberry tuxedo pie, caramelized banana pudding with a vanilla accent, and apple pie were all we could wish for.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses each, came to $64, before tax, tip or drinks. The small wine list, mostly California and West Coast, is well priced, from $19.</p>
        <p>Bailey's Backyard  23 Bailey Street, Ridgefield  (203) 431-0796</p>
