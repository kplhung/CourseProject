      <block class="full_text">
        <p>At 77, President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan is a wily veteran of Soviet politics and of the K.G.B., an 18-year leader of Communist Azerbaijan and, for the last seven years, president of the newly independent country of the same name.</p>
        <p>He has some advice for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, a comparative political novice and former K.G.B. agent: deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as client states with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow.</p>
        <p>''President Putin's program to have a closer cooperation among the countries in general is useful, but it is to be based on the principles of equality and mutual benefits,'' Mr. Aliyev said in an interview. ''It cannot allow the hegemony of any country, including that of Russia.''</p>
        <p>Moscow's recent push to regain control of far-flung Russian regions and to recapture lost influence in former Soviet republics presents a new challenge for Mr. Aliyev, a crafty survivor of Kremlin intrigue.</p>
        <p>Since Communism's collapse, he has sought to align his country with the West while retaining sufficient ties with Russia and managing equally delicate relations with Iran, Azerbaijan's neighbor to the south. Some Azeris fear that Iran wants to export more radical Islam to this Muslim nation while at the same time hindering development of Azerbaijan's oil and natural gas reserves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aliyev has been credited with bringing a measure of economic stability to this country of eight million people, particularly by forging joint ventures with Western oil companies to exploit Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves.</p>
        <p>He also negotiated a cease-fire in the war with neighboring Armenia over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, although the Armenians still occupy a fifth of Azerbaijan's territory and a peace settlement remains elusive.</p>
        <p>Critics complain that little of the promised oil wealth has trickled down to the general population, which includes a million impoverished refugees, most from the war with Armenia. Some also accuse Mr. Aliyev of stifling political dissent by keeping opposition parties weak and substituting his strong personality for lasting institutional change.</p>
        <p>The president, blunt and confident, scoffed at such criticism in the 80-minute interview on Friday in the presidential palace overlooking dozens of aging, abandoned oil derricks. He portrayed himself as the only leader with the ability and experience to guide Azerbaijan through the transition from Communism to capitalism, at one point comparing himself to George Washington.</p>
        <p>Rejecting concerns about his age and quadruple bypass surgery last year, he also vowed to run for re-election in 2003, though some question whether the country's Constitution allows him another term. And he sharply chided the American Congress for blocking government assistance to his country, blaming the influential Armenian-American lobby.</p>
        <p>Under sanctions imposed by Congress in 1992, Azerbaijan cannot receive direct financial assistance or training from the United States government. Armenia, on the other hand, receives $100 million a year in American aid. The situation rankles Azeris at all levels of society and has made it more difficult to deal with the country's refugees.</p>
        <p>''Your Congress, which likes to give lessons to the world about human rights, ignores human rights in this instance,'' Mr. Aliyev said.</p>
        <p>Despite his confidence, Mr. Aliyev has difficulties at home. In the late 1990's, the capital, Baku, was awash with dreams that huge oil strikes would transform the poor country into the next Saudi Arabia or Kuwait. But those dreams have not come true, as the biggest recent oil finds have come on the other side of the Caspian in Kazakhstan. One result is a general restlessness and concern that the country placed too much reliance on oil.</p>
        <p>''Expectations were so high a year ago, and only now are people realizing that you have to develop other sectors of the economy, too,'' said Haver Kambaizadeh, a former history professor who now works for a Western oil company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aliyev appeared aware of the disappointment, saying that his government is working to develop other parts of the economy and that 60 percent of the foreign investment in the country last year went into sectors other than energy.</p>
        <p>But some of that increase stems from a decrease in energy-sector money. Some Western companies, in oil and other fields, have cooled on Baku recently because of concerns about Mr. Aliyev's health and the lack of a clear successor if he leaves office.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Aliyev also seemed conscious of those fears and completely dismissive of them. He said there was no need to worry about a successor because he was confident of re-election in 2003 and insisted that stable democratic institutions would be in place well before he ends that final term. ''I have great dreams, and I know a great program from 2003 to 2008,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He also denigrated the ability of anyone in the current opposition to replace him, describing how the first leadership of newly independent Azerbaijan had been able to halt a civil war in 1993 only by summoning him to become president after he had fallen from favor and been relegated to his ancestral village in southern Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>''Everybody turned to me,'' he said. ''I took my people out of that harsh situation.''</p>
        <p>Despite his surgery last year, Mr. Aliyev boasted that his health was excellent, and he confirmed statements by his aides that he has not taken a day off in seven years. ''I will always be the president here,'' he said with a laugh.</p>
        <p>He said anxieties about succession were premature because he intended to remain in office for another eight years.</p>
