        <p>After Maurice Greene sprinted the 200-meter preliminaries in 20.28 seconds today, he rolled his shoulders, raised a finger in the air and motioned toward Michael Johnson as if to say, ''Bring it on.''</p>
        <p>Running in the next heat, Johnson did exactly that, finishing in 19.89, within three-hundredths of a second of Greene's career best. But Johnson felt his right thigh cramp in the middle of the turn, and his status remained uncertain for Sunday's semifinal and final rounds, which will be run two hours apart at the Olympic track and field trials.</p>
        <p>''It went away on the straights,'' Johnson said of the cramp after having an ice wrap placed on his thigh. ''Hopefully it's nothing. I hope the schedule won't be a problem, but I have no way of knowing right now.''</p>
        <p>This 200 meters has become the most anticipated sprint since Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson met at 100 meters in the final of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Greene is the world's fastest man, holding the world record of 9.79 seconds at 100 meters. Johnson is the Olympic champion and world record-holder at 200 meters (19.32 seconds) and 400 meters (43.18 seconds). However, Johnson has frequently injured himself when running fast. His body is as fine-tuned as a dragster, fragile in its searing speed, needing much tinkering between performances.</p>
        <p>Johnson and Greene have been placed in the same heat of Sunday's semifinal, Greene in Lane 4 and Johnson outside in Lane 5. The sprinters need only to finish among the top four to reach the final, but they may feel a need to send each other a message, which could lead to a fast time or could aggravate an injury. There are no byes or free passes to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The only way to qualify for the 200 is to finish first, second or third in Sunday's final.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the cramp was a temporary seizure, nothing more. Johnson cooled down with no problem after today's heat. But the risk is that he could reinjure himself Sunday, fail to qualify in the 200, threaten his chances to repeat as Olympic champion at 400 meters and also jeopardize an opportunity to win a third gold in the 1,600-meter relay. Clyde Hart, who coaches Johnson, said a decision would be made after Johnson warms up for Sunday's semifinal round.</p>
        <p>''If there is any doubt that he's not well, I'll recommend he not run,'' Hart told the Dallas Morning News. ''There's no use jeopardizing two gold medals to try to get more.''</p>
        <p>In track circles, Johnson has faced some skepticism about his performances in big races, even though he possesses a combination of speed and power that is unprecedented in the long sprints. He pulled up with a strained left thigh during a 1997 match race against Donovan Bailey of Canada, the reigning Olympic champion at 100 meters, leading Bailey to call him chicken and accuse him of faking the injury. Johnson pulled a hamstring muscle while setting his 200 world record at the Atlanta Olympics, then withdrew from the 200 at the 1999 national championships with a strained right hamstring. Greene has accused Johnson of ducking him. If Johnson withdraws or pulls up again on Sunday, his motives will again draw doubts in a sport that thrives on suspicion.</p>
        <p>''When Michael sprints, he gets hurt,'' said Ato Boldon of Trinidad, who finished third to Johnson in the 200 at the Atlanta Olympics and who trains daily with Greene in Los Angeles. ''You can't point to a time when Michael ran a really fast 200, and he did not get hurt.''</p>
        <p>Boldon has picked Johnson to win Sunday's race because he is a more experienced 200-meter runner than Greene. But, Boldon added: ''If for any reason Michael fails to show or does not finish, I think it will conjure too many memories of Bailey-Johnson. He will be seen as someone who can't handle the one-on-one thing. I don't expect that to happen.''</p>
        <p>On a practice track before today's race, Johnson and Greene engaged in a stare down, the sprinter Brian Lewis said. ''That kind of reminded me of a heavyweight title fight, when you've got two guys in each other's faces,'' Lewis said. ''Nobody said anything. They just stared at each other and then laughed.''</p>
        <p>The format of the trials may have contributed to Johnson's injury, said John Chaplin, who will coach the American men in Sydney. In previous years, the 200 has been contested over four rounds. This time, there are only three, leaving more of the top sprinters grouped in the same early heats. Today, only the winner of each of the seven heats was guaranteed a spot in the semifinals, so the sprinters had to run faster than they might have wanted.</p>
        <p>''The heats are overstacked,'' Chaplin said.</p>
        <p>Showing a lack of experience in his heat, Greene accelerated through the curve, eased up then sped up again when his lead was threatened. Such an immature performance could have led to injury. After saying, ''I'm going to get Michael Johnson'' for the past week, Greene decided not to speak to reporters today.</p>
        <p>Still, the trash-talking has become so ostentatious that it did not seem out of place that an Elvis impersonator showed up at the track today in a gold lame suit. Asked whom he favored, Elvis said: ''I don't have any opinion on that. If I say so-and-so, the other guy is going to come and beat me up. I'm pretty vulnerable. I'm already dead. I can't take any more blows like that.''</p>
