        <p>Video Connection, a rental store at  Broadway and 80th Street, is closing at the end of the month. The retailer has been a neighborhood fixture since opening in 1984, not only as a source for unusual movies but also for social life.</p>
        <p>''I'm really dismayed to hear that they're closing,'' said Wick Taylor, who lives nearby.</p>
        <p>A manager, Derek Davidson, who is also a filmmaker, says some customers have come in crying over the loss of the store. ''They seem mad at the system,'' he says. ''Mad that it's hard for small stores like this to stay in business.''</p>
        <p>The store, which attributed the closing to increased expenses, had specialized in classic and foreign movies, including every film by that Upper West Side favorite, Woody Allen.</p>
