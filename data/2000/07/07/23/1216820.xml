        <p>Female Ruins</p>
        <p>By Geoff Nicholson.</p>
        <p>221 pp. Woodstock, N.Y.:</p>
        <p>The Overlook Press. $26.95.</p>
        <p>GEOFF NICHOLSON'S 12th novel is an elegantly constructed and often funny story about a man, a woman and her famous dead father, Christopher Howell, known as ''the greatest modern English architect never to have built a building.'' ''Female Ruins'' -- a daughter's homage to her father's unrealized dreams -- so beautifully evokes her attempt to fathom him that Nicholson might have called it ''What's Poppa?'' or ''Don't Give Me That Architectural Genius Stuff, I'm His Daughter.''</p>
        <p>Kelly Howell, the architect's only child, is the stunted product of a failed marriage, a fragment expelled by a genius. She drives a cab, thinks of lovemaking as a lonely business, recalls that her father neglected her and feels a lingering rage toward her helpless, earthy, boring mother. Kelly wears her tattered history with men matter-of-factly, and she considers herself wise because she believes she's accepted her fate. In reality, she's simply given up on herself. While her father managed to live on the fringes through the affections of his few crazed or wealthy fans, Nicholson writes that ''it was left to Kelly to be the true failure of the family.'' She feels unloved. ''Sometimes she felt as though she had no talent at all.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Howell was a shadowy man who never had time for his family, which he abandoned in order to continue his artful yet puzzlingly unproductive career. In Kelly's eyes, he is a superstar, a cult figure. People either hated or loved him; ''he was someone people didn't feel neutral about'' and ''someone who had to be dealt with.'' The mystery of Howell, even for Kelly, was not his lack of interest in his family, but his lack of any purpose or accomplishment on earth. (If he'd lived longer, would he have built desert palaces, roller coasters, miniature golf courses? She hoped so.)</p>
        <p>Howell is rendered with wry, surgical precision; we see him through Kelly's eyes and through his own writing -- a series of laconic, Rem Koolhaas-style essays on subjects like impermanence or a filthy car garage some men call home or the futuristic designs of Buckminster Fuller, which cannot be cleansed of their humanness. We grow closer to him as the story progresses, the way a child gratefully (and sometimes sadly) learns the truth about the person behind the parent.</p>
        <p>Nicholson, whose earlier novels include ''Bleeding London,'' ''Footsucker'' and ''Still Life With Volkswagens,'' is a British novelist who is fascinated by obsessions and obsessives. This novel fits neatly into his body of work. He has written in the past about topics like food and cars and shopping; ''Female Ruins'' is his architecture novel.</p>
        <p>The story begins in rural Suffolk with the arrival of Jack Dexter, an American with a bad leg. It is the first of many indications that the men in this book are, on good days, gimpy and useless and, on bad days, lying, womanizing, gun-toting, tactless, fat, greedy or drunk. They're world destroyers.</p>
        <p>Dexter, who is one of the few disappointments in the book (we never learn more about him than he knows about himself), serves more as idea, or the representation of a problem, than as person. Formerly a successful real estate agent, he now plods through life as ''an overeducated slacker,'' an aimless perpetual student who is interested in highbrow music, literature and anthropology. This adult child fits strategically into the novel; his plight echoes Kelly's quiet self-destruction as he attempts to transmit some unspoken complaint to his own overly ambitious father.</p>
        <p>A flirtation begins. As it turns out, Dexter's family owns the only Howell house ever built -- a life-size replica of a doll house Howell built for his daughter, a fantastical exercise in the history of architecture. Dexter, we learn, is interested in Kelly so he can write about Howell. Meanwhile, Kelly struts her overt sexiness: while at the wheel of her cab, she wishes she could be the slut in the back seat; at home alone, she thinks of ''sex outdoors, on the beach at Walberswick, on a gravestone in Wangford churchyard.''</p>
        <p>Kelly and Dexter consummate the affair when she wagers her body over a game of miniature golf. Always, though, there's the countervailing force of her loser status: ''Surely it was possible to look at men . . . without weighing them up sexually. The fact that she found it so impossible proved she was too hungry, too desperate. The extent of her needs guaranteed that her needs would not be met.''</p>
        <p>Dexter's quest to make sense of the man who designed his family's house frees this broken young woman from a lifetime of mourning. By the time the couple discover a skeleton's hand near the seaside graveyard of a crumbling medieval monastery, the history that haunts these two slackers has reached perfect narrative pitch. Only moments earlier, Kelly had said, referring to a child who was foolishly climbing a dangerous cliff, ''I blame the parents.'' Dexter, seeing the hand, is frightened and queasy. ''Shouldn't we do something about it?'' Kelly responds: ''Like what? Pop down and collect it as a souvenir?''</p>
        <p>Kelly is not yet 30, and her resignation feels real and sad. In one of this novel's many surprisingly sunny and redemptive moments, she explains of her own home, a tiny, staid chapel that she has defiled with garish paint and trashy furniture, ''You can't wreck a wreck.'' In the book's final section, Kelly is forced to face the wreck. The couple travel to the California desert, to a new world, one capable of granting revelation. Howell's house exists. Neglected for years, it is now inhabited by a creepy, ghostly drifter. There is something so subtle and well thought through about the book's final pages that you can understand why Kelly is nourished by what she sees.</p>
        <p>Her father has in fact made a very small but very real contribution to</p>
        <p>the world: this so-called ''Cardboard House.'' The heart of this cathartic book expertly depicts the struggle to make sense of one's father's genuine worth.</p>
