        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Tommasini's excellent article brought back fond memories of the late 50's in New York, where many of us ''rustics'' from the provinces came to polish our compositional craft. Serialism was in the air and I recall many a stimulating composers forum at the old Cooper Union. I especially remember a fine piece called ''Transformation'' by a young Gunther Schuller, as well as early Wuorinen and Luening and the Columbia cartel. Composers who used 12-tone technique were like gods, and young composers like Lee Hoiby, who was writing beautiful tonal operas, were scoffed at.</p>

        <p>Anthony Tommasini's excellent article brought back fond memories of the late 50's in New York, where many of us ''rustics'' from the provinces came to polish our compositional craft. Serialism was in the air and I recall many a stimulating composers forum at the old Cooper Union. I especially remember a fine piece called ''Transformation'' by a young Gunther Schuller, as well as early Wuorinen and Luening and the Columbia cartel. Composers who used 12-tone technique were like gods, and young composers like Lee Hoiby, who was writing beautiful tonal operas, were scoffed at.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tommasini is absolutely right when he asserts the tyranny lasted into the 1970's, when I returned for doctoral work at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In theory classes, scores such as Berg's ''Lyric Suite'' and the mini-orchestral pieces of Webern were holy writ and tonal works were either ignored or relegated to second- or third-tier status.</p>
        <p>Two things saved me from the serial reign of terror: a wonderful tonal composer, Gerald Kemner, who was my mentor, and my deep and abiding interest in choral music. Serial technique is really an instrumental rather than a vocal idiom. I sleep soundly at night with over 750 published works. At the end of the day, a composer must write what's in his or her head, and not by a system.</p>
