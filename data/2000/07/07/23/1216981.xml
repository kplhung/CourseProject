        <p>THE Chart House is a New Jersey restaurant that may actually be better experienced if you journey there from New York City. Taking the $5 ferry ride from the 38th Street dock in Manhattan to Lincoln Harbor is easy and exhilarating, and the view of Manhattan is spectacular.</p>
        <p>From anywhere else, the approach is through a sea of cars in the lot in front of the Chart House. You can cruise for some time looking for a space, or surrender to a valet. Then, that view -- George Washington Bridge to World Trade Center (the twin towers look like an only child from this angle) -- can be yours as well, perhaps at first from the deck, with a cocktail in hand. (Too bad there aren't more tables for outdoor dining.)</p>

        <p>THE Chart House is a New Jersey restaurant that may actually be better experienced if you journey there from New York City. Taking the $5 ferry ride from the 38th Street dock in Manhattan to Lincoln Harbor is easy and exhilarating, and the view of Manhattan is spectacular.</p>
        <p>From anywhere else, the approach is through a sea of cars in the lot in front of the Chart House. You can cruise for some time looking for a space, or surrender to a valet. Then, that view -- George Washington Bridge to World Trade Center (the twin towers look like an only child from this angle) -- can be yours as well, perhaps at first from the deck, with a cocktail in hand. (Too bad there aren't more tables for outdoor dining.)</p>
        <p>Inside, the circular lobby is topped by an illuminated turret, while the round, dark bar is pierced with small spotlights imitating bracketed boat windows. Swirling 60's patterns on the rug suggest a conference center gone creative, while the wall of windows allow the skyline beyond to accompany you to your table.</p>
        <p>All of this should make the place feel at least somewhat elegant, and yet the feeling is that of an antiseptic modern ski lodge. The windows are tinted, obliterating any feeling of intimacy; the crowded tables seem poised to be rearranged for an office party; and the track lighting is glaringly distracting.</p>
        <p>As part of the Chart House chain, the Weehawken branch will rightly draw crowds for its view, regardless of the atmosphere. (It reopened two months ago, after a huge renovation following a fire two years earlier.) I wish I could say that the food is also worth the trip; unfortunately, the executive chef, Gerald Villa, has had to adhere to the menu outlined on the company's Web site. I wonder what we might see if there were no restricting formula. Still, if you are in the mood for surf and turf in a summery locale, then dive in.</p>
        <p>There are some unexpected treats. The shrimp cocktail arrived in the form of a shrimp martini, the pink flesh perched on a glass filled with gazpacho-style cocktail sauce studded with baby rock shrimp. While the crust on the lobster spring roll was chewy, its interior of sliced vegetables and vibrant, salty lobster did not disappoint. And the rich blue crab dip -- a blend of cream cheese, sour cream, mayonnaise and cheddar, teasingly spiked with Old Bay and cayenne -- was utterly addictive.  The seared, peppered ahi tuna, glistening beneath a spray of lemon vodka sauce, was piquant, carefully refined and pure.</p>
        <p>But there were a few startling combinations. ''Why would they do that to lobster?'' my friend asked of the lobster tempura. Good question. Tender chunks of lobster had become tough cords, gummy from an almost raw crust that even had bits of shell mixed in. Tubes and tentacles of calamari and jumbo lump crab cake were unremarkable. Caesar salad came heavily dressed and miserly portioned, and I had trouble tasting much beyond cornstarch, tarragon, and a heavy dose of brandy in the lobster bisque.</p>
        <p>The way to go here is to choose the less traditional preparations. An entree of grilled teriyaki tenderloin medallions, for example, were juicy and plentiful, served with a mango relish and crispy Kona onions. Macadamia-crusted mahi-mahi, also paired with the relish, was fanned over coconut-ginger rice and a peanut sauce. This aggressive mixing of textures and flavors seamlessly produced a unified dish. My favorite was the pan-seared sea scallops, dusted in Kona flour and served in a soy-ginger broth over spinach, bok choy and coconut-ginger rice.</p>
        <p>You could also choose something decidedly simple but succulent, like the steamed Alaskan king crab legs served with drawn butter, perhaps with a side of salty, sizzling mushrooms. But the larger and more extravagant items like filet mignon or Maine lobster have yet to be mastered.</p>
        <p>Grilled halibut in a sherry vinaigrette may alternate with swordfish, and herb-crusted sea bass in a pommery mustard sauce often changes to salmon; either way, these preparations are pleasing but nondescript.  Still, they far surpass the sodden vegetable bowl, composed of matchstick vegetables and Japanese wheat noodles in a miso broth. ''Swampy'' was the word used at my table, and it fit. Finally, the Chart House would be well served to take the cioppino off the menu, or at least to add pasta to the current version and call it fussilli de frutti di mare. Instead of the traditional bouillabaise-like seafood stew, this saucy version was closer to a paste than a broth.</p>
        <p>The Chart House makes a big fuss about its chocolate lava cake -- a molten Godiva chocolate mound, doused in bittersweet chocolate sauce and chunks of crumbled Heath bar -- and the kid in me is glad they do. You'll need to order it at the beginning of your meal. The Key lime pie is piled high with whipped cream, if you like that. Don't bother experimenting with the Kona cooler and the chocolate colada. In this case, it is wiser to sample alcohol and sugar separately.</p>
        <p>A cold cup of coffee made it clear that the eager servers at the Chart House are still in training. But I didn't want to dwell on negative thoughts as I paid my bill. I was eager to see the skyline from a ferry again, not from inside an aquarium.</p>
