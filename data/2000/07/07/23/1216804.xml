      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Four years after the 1831 slave revolt led by Nat Turner in Virginia, black Americans were still being worked like livestock and their white owners were even more fearful of insurrection. In a masterly piece of historical storytelling, Barbara Hambly calls up the horrors of slavery in SOLD DOWN THE RIVER (Bantam, $23.95), the fourth and most unsettling chapter in her remarkable series featuring Benjamin January, a freed slave whose Paris education earns him a living in New Orleans and whose refined sense of justice puts him in peril wherever he goes.</p>
        <p>In a haunting tale told ''in the dark of the moon,'' Ben bends his back to the pain and humiliation of being a slave again when he goes undercover at a sugar cane plantation 20 miles up the river, where a rebellion may be brewing. ''This is slavery,'' Ben is reminded when he joins the exhausted field hands toiling night and day to harvest the cane. ''This is what I'd almost forgotten.'' Only the words of Dante (''Through me the way into the suffering city, / Through me the way to eternal pain'') and the songs of the slaves (''They carry them down to the river, / They throw them in the stream'') give him spiritual comfort from the grueling labor, the savage beatings and the slave owner's magisterial indifference to the suffering that even voodoo curses can't stop.</p>
        <p>For a hard-boiled free agent who normally expresses himself in swift and brutal body language, Jack Reacher does a lot of talking and thinking in Lee Child's RUNNING BLIND (Putnam, $18.95). There's a reason for that. This ex-military policeman needs all his wits about him to catch the extraordinarily disciplined and well-organized killer who is crisscrossing the country, murdering former Army personnel in a bizarre manner that involves bathtubs and gallons of paint. (Did I mention bizarre?) The victims were all women who left the service after bringing sexual harassment charges against superior officers, but both method and motive are inscrutable. The military and the F.B.I. are stumped. So are we. Even when Child allows us to observe the killer at various stages of his craft, it's a perfect puzzlement exactly how -- and why -- he pulls it off.</p>
        <p>After four books in this raw series, the romantic persona of Child's rootless hero is starting to wear. ''All my life, I've been moving, literally. I was scared to stop,'' Reacher tells us for the umpteenth time. His constant needling of the F.B.I. agents for their stuck-in-the-mud minds and by-the-book procedures is even more of an irritant -- especially from someone who withholds his own theories until the last third of the narrative. But those theories are indeed clever, and for all his abrasive, show-off ways, Jack uses honest ingenuity to outwit his adversary.</p>
        <p>Tempe Brennan, the forensic anthropologist who rattles the skeletons in Kathy Reichs's commendably technical mysteries, really loves her grisly job. ''When a conventional autopsy is of no use, I tease what I can from the bones'' is how she describes her work in DEADLY DeCISIONS (Scribner, $25). Bomb victims are always a special challenge for Brennan, who pursues a double-barreled law enforcement career in North Carolina and Quebec province. When the Montreal biker chapters of the Vipers and the Heathens start tossing lethal missiles, she has to identify the remains of two bodies from 215 fragments of flesh and bone, and the largest piece is only 11 pounds. Just to make it more interesting, the victims are identical twins.</p>
        <p>Reichs's plotting technique consists of neatly aligning coincidental events (''perhaps the timing of his visit was fortunate''), and her forced emotional connections reduce her competent scientist to weeping copious tears over the child cadavers that turn up on her morgue slab. But to her credit, the author doesn't dumb down the scientific stuff, delivering the full textbook version of subjects like hydrocephalus, blood-spatter analysis, ground-penetrating radar devices and the history of outlaw motorcycle clubs in North America.</p>
        <p>Penelope Evans has an uncanny way with voices. In her chilling debut novel, ''The Last Girl,'' she addressed the reader in the chatty tones of a lonely old geezer who becomes obsessed with a young student who moves into his rooming house. She adopted a nervous stutter in ''Freezing'' for the confidences of a mortuary attendant who falls in love with a pale, drowned girl. Now, in FIRST FRUITS (Soho, $23), she speaks in the captivating idiom of Kate Carr, a 14-year-old Scottish schoolgirl with a quick mind and a gift for manipulating people. ''I made a new friend today,'' this sly child says. ''Now I'm wondering how I'm going to get rid of her.'' As in the previous stories, the suspense turns on slow-dawning character revelations -- the secrets here involve Kate's compulsion to please her adored father -- that are advanced by a sense of numbing dread, rather than the cold shock of total surprise. Working her subtle skills, Evans again takes us deep into the psyche of someone who isn't at all what she seems.</p>
        <p>Now, here's a surprise. When a ''borderline depressive'' like Stephen Greenleaf's San Francisco private eye, John Marshall Tanner, reaches his 50th birthday, you'd expect the guy to fuel his existential angst with a nice, gloomy case. On the contrary, this moody gumshoe has himself a party in ELLIPSIS (Scribner, $24), playing bodyguard to a monstrously egocentric celebrity author (but a ''spiritual icon'' to her fans) and laughing up his sleeve at the cutthroat practices of the publishing industry. There is a dark side to the narrative: the writer's chauffeur is killed by a car bomb meant for her, and every one of her mortal enemies has a sad story to tell. But for the most part, Greenleaf has fun picking apart the seamier aspects of the book trade: the embarrassing cases of plagiarism, the frenzied book-signing parties, the vicious author rivalries and those brittle business lunches with agents and publicists who are perpetually locked in a death grip with their cell phones. It's all Tanner can do to keep a straight face.</p>
