        <p>Sara Mosle (July 2) aptly pointed out that volunteers cannot succeed alone. While they are in no way dispensable, volunteers need the support and structure provided by a professional staff and by government programs and financing. This partnership ensures that the clients receive the continuity they deserve. The government also benefits since volunteers provide a large portion of social service work and, in doing so, help government funds go further. It is essential that we not create a false dichotomy between volunteers, or ''charity'' as a whole, and government. Each strengthens the other.</p>
