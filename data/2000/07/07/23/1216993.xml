        <p>If you're a Manhattanite who dreams of being the island's last survivor but are more the PBS ''1900 House'' type, Jon Carlson is the man to help you prep for the big hike.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carlson, 41, left, is an East Villager who owns Expedition 8, an outfitting company that leads trips to really, really inaccessible places in Patagonia, the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania, the Canadian Rockies and other far-flung wildernesses. This is not car camping. Mr. Carlson's prefered destinations include mesas reached only by small plane, and canyons that have been mapped out just in the last 30 years.</p>
        <p>Aware that these days guidebooks cover a lot of this extreme ground, Mr. Carlson also offers services to smooth the way. He arrives with everything from permits to provisions, including his homemade turkey jerky. He meets with potential trekkers beforehand to suss out where their vacation dreams and fitness levels meet, helps shop for gear and provides what they may not want to buy (a Marmot convertible desert/blizzard tent?). You don't have to be an Ironman to apply; his clients range from flat-walk beginners to those who thrive on physical challenge. If you're a sedentary dot-com drudge, ''I won't suggest a trail with a lot of up and burning thighs,'' he said, ''even though the scenery is wonderful.''
