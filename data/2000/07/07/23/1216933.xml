        <p>JOANN MAGNUS was suffering from glioblastoma multiforme, a lethal form of brain cancer. Doctors told Ms. Magnus, a 50-year-old Westbury woman, that she would be fortunate to live for a year, but she had heard about an experimental program at Brookhaven National Laboratory that could give her more time.</p>
        <p>Problem was, the program hadn't used a human subject for 32 years.</p>
        <p>Responding to Ms. Magnus's pleas, researchers at the lab's medical research reactor placed her on a gurney so her tumor was positioned in front of a hole leading to the reactor core. A shield was removed and a neutron beam emerged unseen from the hole, bombarding Ms. Magnus's malignancy as she lay perfectly still for 45 minutes, listening to her favorite music piped into the room.</p>
        <p>The treatment, called boron neutron capture therapy, was a limited success; Ms. Magnus outlived her prognosis. ''She lived over one year and had a good quality of life,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Coderre, the principal scientist working on the therapy at the lab. ''She went back to work. The average survival after surgery and standard radiation treatment, with all of that, is 9 to 10 months.''</p>
        <p>All told, 53 brain cancer patients were treated at B.N.L.'s medical research reactor in clinical trials that began with Ms. Magnus in 1994 and ended in May last year. Though the trials were intended only to discover how much of a neutron-attracting boron compound should be injected into a patient and how intense the neutron beam bombarding the tumor should be, in some cases the experiments were a boon to patients: one man is still alive nearly five years after undergoing the treatment; three others have survived more than two years.</p>
        <p>''The trial was a success,'' Dr. Coderre said. ''We know how much of this type of radiation a person can withstand. That's very valuable information. Now we know what the upper limit is.''</p>
        <p>His view was echoed by James Decker, acting director of the office of science of the Department of Energy in Washington. ''A lot of data was obtained,'' he said. ''The phase-one trials are successful in that they did what they were supposed to do in terms of determining toxicity levels.''</p>
        <p>Odd, then, that B.N.L.'s director, John Marburger, cited ''discouraging results'' in the neutron capture therapy trials as the reason that the Department of Energy was ending funding for the reactor. It is to be shut down next January.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marburger later said that the results of the trials indicate that three to five years of additional work needs to be done before human trials can be attempted again. ''We're very happy to continue the research,'' Dr. Marburger said. ''It's still a viable, interesting way of treating cancer, but it doesn't require reactor trials at Brookhaven.''</p>
        <p>The closing of the medical reactor follows the permanent shutdown of B.N.L.'s much more powerful high flux beam reactor last year. The medical reactor is the last operating nuclear reactor on the Island.</p>
        <p>''It really ends an era on Long Island,'' said Scott Cullen, attorney for Standing for Truth About Radiation, a nuclear watchdog group that has been at the forefront of efforts to shut down B.N.L.'s reactors. ''It's a big event. It had been leaking tritium into the groundwater and they were never really sure where it came from.''</p>
        <p>The tritium plume under the reactor came from a leaking underground tank that collected secondary cooling system water, B.N.L. officials said. The concentrations of tritium in the groundwater measured near the site, according to Tom Sheridan, deputy director of operations at B.N.L, were too small to warrant a clean-up.</p>
        <p>''Trying to clean up a tritium plume is like trying to remove the hydrogen from water,'' Mr. Sheridan said. ''It's in the groundwater, but not moving fast enough to get to site boundaries before it has long since decayed away.''</p>
        <p>The demise of the medical reactor is linked to the shutdown of the high flux beam reactor, which supplied workers and reactor expertise to medical researchers, lowering the annual operating cost of the smaller reactor to $1.4 million, compared to $2.4 million to operate the medical reactor alone. Ten workers at the medical reactor will be reassigned as a result of the closure, officials said.</p>
        <p>The medical reactor -- at three megawatts a weakling compared to the high flux beam reactor, which was 10 times more powerful -- was a followup to a program begun in 1951 at B.N.L.'s graphite reactor, the first reactor ever built for civilian research. But the graphite reactor was a crude tool for experiments on humans. A patient was sedated, then lowered on a gurney into a shielded pit in the reactor core. As the scientists ran for cover, the patient's head was bombarded with a neutron beam generated by the reactor.</p>
        <p>The graphite reactor's beam was poorly controlled, B.N.L. scientists say today, and the boron compound used to attract the neutrons to the tumor never collected deeply enough inside the tumor to be effective. Many patients suffered serious burns.</p>
        <p>Doctors halted trials pending construction of a reactor designed specifically to handle clinical experiments on people, and the result was the medical reactor, completed in 1959. Researchers then resumed clinical trials, but these ended in 1961. It was more than 30 years until the compound that delivers the boron to tumors was developed enough to begin human trials again, spurred on by Ms. Magnus's appeal.</p>
        <p>''The problem with this tumor is it's invasive,'' Dr. Coderre said. ''There are small clusters of cells invading normal areas within the brain. The problem is how to deliver boron to these cells.''</p>
        <p>Researchers have been drawn to the potential of the therapy because it requires only a single radiation treatment and offers a way to selectively destroy cells.</p>
        <p>''The attraction is that you load the tumor cells with boron and then you treat with neutrons. The combination of the two makes it possible to kill a tumor cell and not damage a normal cell next to it,'' Dr. Coderre said. ''Particularly for this type of brain tumor, that is the problem.''</p>
        <p>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using funds from the Department of Energy, recently upgraded their own reactor to continue boron neutron capture therapy trials on people suffering from skin cancer.</p>
        <p>''The field will continue and most other sites will use the results from B.N.L.,'' Dr. Coderre said. He added that trials are scheduled in Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden for patients with brain tumors.</p>
        <p>Related research will continue at B.N.L., where scientists are working on developing the compound that delivers boron to cancerous tumors. The future of boron neutron capture therapy is unlikely to depend upon nuclear reactors.</p>
        <p>''People are prejudiced against nuclear reactors; nobody wants to have a nuclear reactor in their neighborhoods,'' said Dr. Nora Volkow, the head of life sciences at B.N.L. ''So you have to deal with this.''</p>
        <p>One way that B.N.L., scientists are trying to deal with that is to adapt a small particle accelerator -- formerly used by the F.A.A. to check baggage at airports -- to generate a neutron beam that can be used to treat patients. The accelerator would be about the size of a small car, Dr. Volkow said, and could ultimately be set up in a hospital if the treatment is found to be successful.</p>
        <p>The closing of B.N.L.'s medical reactor seems to put an end to the chance that a nuclear reactor will ever be built again for research purposes on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''Never say never, but the modern trend is to use accelerators for these things,'' Dr. Marburger said. ''If we ever get back into this business of using neutrons for science, it'll be with accelerators.''</p>
