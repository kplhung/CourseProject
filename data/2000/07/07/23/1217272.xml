        <p>On the first hole yesterday at the Instinet Classic in Princeton, N.J., Bob Murphy carded a bogey that dropped him five shots behind the leaders. But from the fifth hole to the 15th, Murphy birdied eight of the 11 holes, and his seven-under 65 tied the Jasna Polana course record set by Tom Jenkins in the opening round on Friday.</p>
        <p>Murphy nudged his way in front before settling for a three-way tie atop the leader board with Jenkins and Gil Morgan.</p>
        <p>The 57-year-old Murphy has 11 Senior Tour titles, but has not won since 1997. Since switching putters earlier this season, he has become competitive again.</p>
        <p>''I'm putting as well as I can remember, as well as I ever have in my career,'' Murphy said. ''I started horribly today and kept telling myself, 'I'm doing too many things right to get off track.'''</p>
        <p>Jenkins appeared set to pull away from the field, entering the day with a two-stroke advantage over Morgan and Jerry McGee and then carding birdies on three of the first four holes. But he parred the next 10 holes and bogeyed the 17th to finish with a 68. The three now enter the final day three strokes ahead of the nearest competitor.</p>
        <p>''I got off to a good start,'' said Jenkins, who earned his only Senior Tour victory in this event last year. ''I thought I might pull a Tiger Woods on them. But midway through the round I cooled off.''</p>
        <p>Jim Dent's eagle on the 18th hole gave him the Super Senior title for the two-day event, leaving him just three strokes off the overall lead at eight under. You don't think about Super Seniors, Dent said. You go for the overall tournament and if you play well, the Super Seniors will come to you.</p>

        <p>FAXON PULLS INTO TIE FOR LEAD: Brad Faxon, the defending champion, shot a four-under-par 68 yesterday to tie Esteban Toledo for the third-round lead in the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Faxon, trying to become the first player to win the tournament twice in a row, sank a curving 15-foot putt for birdie on No. 18 to finish at 202, 14 under par. Toledo, who began the day with a three-shot lead, made a great save for par on the final hole to finish with a 71. (AP)</p>
