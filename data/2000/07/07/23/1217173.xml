        <p>Correction of July 16 Q&amp;A column on deducting property taxes on tax returns; rules explained</p>

As noted, at least 80 percent of a co-op's income must come from shareholders in order for them to claim the deductions. Interest on a reserve fund is not countable as coming from shareholders, no matter how the fund is used.</p>
