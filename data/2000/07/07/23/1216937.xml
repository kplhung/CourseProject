        <p>Although the cosmos of inexpensive wines offers glittering values, Riedel glassware expands the total experience immeasurably. A one-time splurge pays compound interest on purchases under $20.</p>
        <p>On and off I've used Riedel stemware designed for various wines for tastings, but mostly I have relied on one-size-fits-all pinched-waist glasses that concentrate and retain aromas and flavors.</p>
        <p>But I recently acquired the cabernet-merlot glass in Riedel's slightly ornate, mid-priced Wine series, released last year, and, though the owner Georg Riedel might disapprove, I've used it experimentally for all still wines. I have sampled scores of wines side by side in the Riedel and the old reliable glasses. Each time, the Riedel enhanced them: remember, smell governs taste.</p>
        <p>As I kept my nose in the oversize 9 1/4-inch-high cabernet glass with a 2 3/4-inch mouth for minutes on end, the wines' structures and flavors became magnified, and hitherto undetectable nuances (and flaws, like too much alcohol) announced themselves.</p>
        <p>Some years ago, I had the same experience when using expensive Riedels in a dialogue with the movingly brilliant rieslings and spatburgunders (pinot noirs) made by Weingut J. B. Becker in the Rheingau region of Germany. At the time, Riedels seemed extravagantly pricey, and I bought none. Years of potential knowledge lost!</p>
        <p>Riedels must be treated gingerly, individually washed and handdried and stored with bowls upright to avoid absorbing shelf odors. Glasses in the Wine series, typically $17.50 each, come in four packs.</p>
        <p>Many merchants will special order them for customers. A major source is the Wine Enthusiast, a catalog-sales house at 8 Saw Mill River Road, Hawthorne, and after Aug. 1, at 103 Fairview Avenue, Elmsford.</p>
