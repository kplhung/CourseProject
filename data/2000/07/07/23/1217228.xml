        <p>It is not easy being a tree in New York City, the tour guide ventured to guess yesterday as he walked a group of nearly a dozen guests through Fulton Park in Bedford-Stuyvesant.</p>
        <p>The guide, Orville Edwards, 26, said the biggest threats to trees in New York were pollution and cars knocking them over.</p>
        <p>''This is the most commonly planted tree in the city,'' Mr. Edwards said, pointing to the thick trunk of a cross between an American sycamore and an Oriental sycamore in Fulton Park. ''They are very resistant to most disease and pollution.''</p>
        <p>When most outsiders think of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Mr. Edwards said, images of fires, crime scenes and dilapidated buildings -- a so-called asphalt jungle -- fill their heads, based on what they have seen on television.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Edwards, a native of Jamaica who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, took a group on a nature tour there. The tour is one of dozens offered each summer by the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment, based in Park Slope.</p>
        <p>The tour of Bedford-Stuyvesant is unusual, its organizers said, in that it brings people -- many of whom have never been to the neighborhood they associate with urban blight -- face to face with a place where nature merges with the urban landscape.</p>
        <p>''We pretty much have more brownstones than anywhere in New York City,'' Mr. Edwards told the group, pointing out magnolias and gardens along tree-lined Stuyvesant Avenue in the historic district.</p>
        <p>He talked not only about the squirrels and yellow-bellied sapsucker woodpeckers that frequent backyards, but also about where the limestone and brownstone on the buildings came from.</p>
        <p>''You don't see much limestone in the neighborhood,'' said Mr. Edwards, an environmental coordinator with the Magnolia Tree Environmental Center. ''The brownstone is the most popular facade.''</p>
        <p>Then he discussed the neighborhood's history: the Woolworth family once had a mansion there; many wealthy white residents moved out as blacks moved in from the Lower East Side in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>As the tour group members strolled down Bedford-Stuyvesant's avenues and side streets, they at times seemed out of place. Most residents and business owners waved, while others gave only curious stares. Rodrique Morara, 59, a retired truck driver who lives across from the Boys and Girls School, where the group stopped to look at an American birch tree, gently needled them.</p>
        <p>''That's poison ivy, of course, that is elementary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stella Jouranis, 64, a retired secretary from Bay Ridge, said she had never been to Bedford-Stuyvesant and was surprised by its charm.</p>
        <p>''I have lived in Brooklyn all my life and traveled around,'' she said. ''The streets are not this clean in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>She added that it was surprising that ''the neighborhood is so beautiful and it has a lot to offer, and how clean they keep the streets, and how kind all the people are.'' After a moment of reflection, Ms. Jouranis asked a reporter, ''Do you know how much buildings are going for in this neighborhood?''</p>
