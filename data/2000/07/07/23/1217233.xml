        <p>Turning from what has become an  annual ritual  the gathering of leaders of the largest industrialized nations -- President Clinton today shaved short his meetings here to plunge back into the fervid search for peace in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>The president left at midday and was scheduled to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington by late afternoon Eastern time, then board a helicopter for Camp David.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who arrived in Japan on Friday, a day late, from the Camp David summit meeting with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians, received several briefings a day on their continuing talks with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, administration officials said. They said he heeded advice from aides, however, to avoid making calls from Japan to either Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel or the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat.</p>
        <p>An optimistic Mr. Clinton said before departing today that negotiators were making headway in his absence. ''Whether we get an agreement or not, they have tried,'' the president said. ''They have really been out there working.''</p>
        <p>The president left Okinawa half a day early, after meeting Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, to rejoin the talks at Camp David this evening, said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is attending his last summit meeting with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and Russia. American diplomats said the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, had impressed the group in his debut at this venue, displaying alacrity and a lack of the ebullience associated with his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>With no history to be made thousands of miles from Camp David and no crises to distract them, the leaders aired issues that have traditionally taken a secondary place at the annual gathering, and released a declaration focusing on the importance of getting the developing world hooked up with the Internet.</p>
        <p>Participants said that in discussions that often resembled philosophical discourses the leaders also pondered the human genome, infectious diseases and rain forests, reaching common ground that will be reflected in a joint statement to be released later today.</p>
        <p>The president announced a $300 million initiative to provide school lunches to students in developing countries, which he said would not only boost nutrition but also improve attendance and performance.</p>
        <p>In contrast to previous summit meetings, overshadowed by crises such as fighting in the Balkans or the financial crisis in Asia, ''there was not one major problem we needed to address,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said on Sunday. Therefore, he added, ''you will see a list of subjects addressed in the communique.''</p>
        <p>Lael Brainard, President Clinton's adviser on international economic issues, said Okinawa ''is shaping up as the development summit.''</p>
        <p>The leaders' new-found concern with what has become known as the ''digital divide'' -- between those who are part of the new computer-driven economy and those who are not -- found little sympathy from critics in nongovernmental groups that seek less sophisticated aid to the developing world.</p>
        <p>Activists with Jubilee 2000, an organization pushing for debt relief, burned a laptop computer outside the news media center. ''We can't eat computers,'' said Kewesi Owusu, the group's African coordinator. ''People are dying.''</p>
        <p>Seth Amgot, a spokesman for Oxfam, the British charity with extensive operations in the poor countries of the world, said: ''The Internet is going to have to wait until the electricity grid is extended, the phone grid is extended and more kids learn to read. The private sector is handling this computer revolution pretty well on its own.''</p>
        <p>The leaders said they would create what they called a ''dot force'' -- or digital opportunity task force -- to marshal public and private resources to bring the computer revolution to poorer nations.</p>
        <p>The leaders cited statistics showing that of the estimated 332 million people who use the Internet, fewer than 1 percent live in Africa. Part of the problem is just telephone lines. The developed world has about 50 phone lines per 100 people compared with 1.4 phones in poorer countries.</p>
        <p>The leaders also agreed in principle to revive World Trade Organization negotiations on starting another round of global trade talks by the end of this year. But they remained at odds on the details of the next round. Disagreements over that round -- principally between the United States and Europe, but also between the developed world and poorer nations -- proved so divisive at the world trade meeting in Seattle last year that it collapsed in discord.</p>
        <p>The leaders here also discussed the importance of good health to a nation's economy and vowed to help the developing world combat infectious diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Japan led the way with $3 billion to fight diseases in poor countries, along with a $15 billion aid package to help countries take advantage of the computer age.</p>
        <p>During a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Clinton, however, Mr. Putin gave up no ground when the president scolded the Russian in one exchange for not respecting press freedom. But Mr. Putin brought smiles to the faces of the American delegation when he told them about his visit to North Korea, en route to Japan, and the striking similarities with the Soviet Union of Stalinist times. North Korea's economic state, Mr. Putin reportedly said, reminded him of the Soviet Union in the 1950's. Mr. Putin said that a million North Koreans had turned out to see him, noting that some probably did not volunteer.</p>
        <p>Most of the declarations and agreements came in the form of general commitments with no dollar figures attached. Mr. Blair tried to solicit funds to relieve the debt of poor  nations but, in their final statement  the leaders will instead restate their intention to carry out a pact they reached at their meeting last year in Cologne, Germany.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 25, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the Group of 8 summit meeting in Japan referred incorrectly in some copies to an adviser to President Clinton on international economic issues, who commented on the meeting. The adviser, Lael Brainard, is a woman.</p>
