        <p>WHEN I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever. Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats, defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another guidebook or decipher another map? I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any more strange bedrooms.  I want to forget all those uneasy searches for public toilets.</p>
        <p>Our friends applaud this decision. They  think James and I travel too much anyway. ''Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ''Everyone knows you can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in: ''How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're never home.''</p>

        <p>WHEN I have finally opened the mail, unpacked my bags, started the washing machine, restocked the refrigerator and riffled through a few newspapers, I am ready to stay home forever. Yes, I realize, I'm totally exhausted. I stroke our cats, defrost some homemade soup and soon send my husband, James, to his office so I can luxuriate in having the house to myself. No, I am not going to travel again for a long time. Months and months, maybe longer. Who knows when I'll ever be ready to study another guidebook or decipher another map? I am tired of looking at menus. I can't bear to sleep in any more strange bedrooms.  I want to forget all those uneasy searches for public toilets.</p>
        <p>Our friends applaud this decision. They  think James and I travel too much anyway. ''Of course you have a cold,'' one says. ''Everyone knows you can't travel on a plane without getting sick.'' Another chimes in: ''How can you complain of not getting any writing done? You're never home.''</p>
        <p>Some urge us to slow down, take it easy. Others suggest getting back to work, enjoying my garden, volunteering for a local charity. I'm sure they are right. In fact, as I nod in agreement, I feel morally invigorated. Travel is a kind of addiction, I tell myself, and I must simply let it go for a while. I can. I know I can.</p>
        <p>Then something happens. If I could predict it, I might be able to ward it off. But the travel impulse is sly, mysterious and dazzlingly sudden. Last December, glad to be home for the holidays after a hectic trip to London, I was savoring the prospect of quiet weeks ahead. Then I opened a Christmas card from a family friend in my Iowa hometown. Close to 90 now, cheerful and bright but unable to travel, Isabel wrote: ''You certainly travel a lot. But do keep it up as long as you can! I wish I had seen York and Cornwall. But I am so thankful I didn't miss the Alhambra and the Prado.'' The Alhambra! I thought. The Prado! Why is it we've never been there? Immediately I began to think of Spain. Why not Portugal too? Perhaps next fall?</p>
        <p>A few days later, on New Year's Eve, I was transfixed by the televised fantasy of fireworks that lit up the bejeweled Eiffel Tower. Oh, Paris, beautiful City of Light -- had it really been five years since we'd walked along the Seine? I could instantly envision broad boulevards, thin women with chic silk scarves, and a corner patisserie where I bought a moist round mouthful of chocolate cake with an indescribably delicious coffee-flavored icing. Definitely, back to Paris.</p>
        <p>Cleaning my desk the following week, I took off the wall an outdated calendar with large color photographs of waterfalls. I hadn't really noticed it much. But now I was transfixed by a view of Upper Yosemite Falls, tumbling down magnificent snow-covered cliffs. I hadn't been to Yosemite for more than 30 years, and I barely remembered my one day there. How could I think of Paris, or Spain, when I hadn't really experienced Yosemite?</p>
        <p>I am helpless against unforeseen assaults on my homebound intentions. Occasionally, when I am already on a trip, I have a passing glimpse of a destination that calls to me so seductively I know I must answer. One June afternoon, on a fast train from Inverness to London, I glanced, for only a whizzing moment, far across miles of empty fields to a tiny village of snug houses clustered around a bay. The surrounding countryside seemed so undiscovered, the village so remote. I studied my map: Alnmouth, Northumberland. Three years later, we were walking through light rain down its long quiet beach.</p>
        <p>On another afternoon, this time in early fall, I sat on a level rock at the northernmost edge of Scotland and gazed, entranced, at the distant gray-green shapes of the Orkney Islands half-hidden in the mist. They seemed as if they belonged to a different world. ''James,'' I said, ''we have to go there.'' James smiled, partly in resignation. ''O.K.,'' he said amiably, ''but why don't we finish this trip first?'' Two Octobers later, we rented a cottage for a week on an Orkney island called, disarmingly, Mainland.</p>
        <p>Sometimes all it takes is a single picture or a few words. We once spent a week near Cromer, on the north Norfolk coast, because that was the phrase -- ''the north Norfolk coast'' -- occasionally appearing in travel guides, that had begun to haunt my imagination. It sounded so unlike the cozy Cotswolds, or the well-trodden and prosaically named Lake District, or flowering Kent, the Garden of England. Then I read P. D. James's ''Devices and Desires,'' and her intensely evocative description of that bleak, windswept land made me determined to see if she was right. And she was.</p>
        <p>Although P. D. James first sent me to Norfolk, Arthur Conan Doyle to Dartmoor  and Dylan Thomas to Wales, I am not often struck by the travel impulse when I read nonfiction travel books. This may seem odd, since I have indulged in such memoirs myself. But, after closing a particularly atmospheric or vivid travel narrative, I tend to think: ''O.K. Wonderful. Now I've been there.'' If the author has filled my eyes with his or her personal vision, I am perversely not moved to explore certain corners of Provence, or Tuscany, or Patagonia.</p>
        <p>If, however, I am swept into a place by reading a novel or biography, I absorb the landscape sidewise, out of the corner of my eye. Then I become intrigued. After finishing Tim Binding's ''Lying With the Enemy,'' a novel about life in occupied Guernsey during World War II, I asked James, ''Why haven't we ever been to the Channel Islands?'' He looked blank. I handed him the novel, and the next year, we were off.</p>
        <p>My love of Scottish islands began, not with a guidebook, but with Gavin Maxwell's ''Ring of Bright Water,'' an account of life with his beloved otters. I soon tracked Maxwell through his later, much harsher, memoirs, ''The Rocks Remain'' and ''Raven Seek Thy Brother,'' and, after many years, I eventually looked across the water to the lonely site of his nearly inaccessible Camusfearna. As James and I walked parts of the rocky coastline of western Scotland, and explored Mull and Skye that year, I often thought of Maxwell's intense, troubled spirit. His love of this land had brought us there.</p>
        <p>OR had it? As a young girl, I used to sit at the piano and play through ''The Fireside Book of Folk Songs.'' One of my favorites was ''The Skye Boat Song.'' Its simple, poignant melody had an unforgettable refrain, especially alluring to an Iowa girl who lived far from any ocean: ''Carry the lad who was born to be king/Over the sea to Skye.'' I didn't know the story of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I had no idea where Skye was, but I knew loss and regret when I heard it. Over the sea to Skye: someday perhaps I would know more.</p>
        <p>So even a song can start me thinking of travel. After our trip to Hawaii last winter, James began to play a CD we bought there. He plays it a lot, especially when it gets really cold outside. Like James, I had been delighted by our relaxing, balmy week on Molokai. So when I hear ''Polynesian Love Song'' or ''Lovely Hula Hands,'' I don't think, ''This is corny.'' No, I want to be back on our screened lanai, listening to the warm splashing surf a few yards away.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take much. Sometimes I think I should look for an antidote, but I haven't thought of one yet. Maybe if I muttered Thoreau's proud boast, ''I have traveled much in Concord''? If I repeated like a mantra, ''Home is where the heart is''? What about a CD that played, again and again, ''Home Sweet Home''? I'm not sure any of it would help.</p>
