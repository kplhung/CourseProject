        <p>Although the cosmos of inexpensive wines offers glittering values, Riedel glassware expands the total experience immeasurably. A one-time splurge pays compound interest on purchases under $20.</p>
        <p>Although I've used Riedel stemware designed for various wines for tastings, mostly I have relied on one-size-fits-all pinched-waist glasses that concentrate and retain aromas and flavors.</p>
        <p>But I recently acquired the cabernet-merlot glass in Riedel's slightly ornate, midpriced Wine%%cap W%% series, and, though the owner, Georg%%cq%% Riedel, might disapprove, have used it experimentally for all still wines. I have sampled scores of wines side by side in the Riedel and the old reliable glasses. Each time, the Riedel enhanced them: Remember, smell governs taste.</p>
        <p>As I kept my nose in the oversize 9 1/4-inch-high cabernet glass with a 2 3/4-inch mouth for long minutes, the wines' structures and flavors grew magnified, and hitherto undetectable nuances (and flaws, like too much alcohol) surfaced.</p>
        <p>Years ago, I had the same experience when using expensive Riedels in a dialogue with brilliant rieslings and sp2atburgunders (pinot noirs) made by Weingut J. B. Becker in the Rheingau region of Germany. At the time, Riedels seemed extravagantly pricey, and I bought none. Years of potential knowledge lost!</p>
        <p>Riedels must be treated gingerly, individually washed and hand-dried, and stored with bowls upright to avoid absorbing shelf odors. Glasses in the Wine series, typically $17.50 each, come in four-packs.</p>
        <p>Many wine merchants will special-order them. In Manhattan, Riedels are carried by Carlyle Wines, 997 Madison Avenue (77th Street); New York Wine Exchange, 9 Beaver Street (Broadway); and Royal Wine Merchants, 25 Waterside Plaza (East 25th Street).</p>
