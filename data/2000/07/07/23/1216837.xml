        <p>Aaron Spelling himself reduced the formula for his success to its simplest ingredients when describing his newest nighttime drama, ''Titans,'' to make its debut on NBC in October: ''It's passion and fashion.''</p>
        <p>He wasn't the first person to combine those two elements memorably. It takes no mental gymnastics to come up with other examples of the passion-and-fashion meld -- Gone With the Wind,'' ''The Women,'' any opera, any Marilyn Manson video. But for his medium, television, Spelling has been the reigning purveyor of the passion-and-fashion formula in its various guises for decades. And at a time when nothing is more automated than a runway show, it's easy to see why designers would glom onto the entire Spelling oeuvre.</p>
        <p>Certainly the return to Spelling-era excess is the reason his shows -- from ''The Love Boat'' to ''Dynasty'' -- were referenced everywhere this season. That's the most obvious excuse (and ''excuse'' is the right word), but perhaps it's something more. In the bleak parody that fashion's rituals have become -- models spewed onto runways, schematic fashion shoots -- perhaps designers are hungry for passion itself, not mere opulence.</p>
        <p>Spelling's use of clothes is anything but dispassionate. Fashion even passes for character work in most of the Spelling-produced dramas, which is probably why the characters -- Peggy Lipton's Julie Barnes in ''The Mod Squad,'' Jaclyn Smith's Kelly Garrett in ''Charlie's Angels,'' Shannen Doherty's Brenda Walsh in ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' Joan Collins's Alexis Carrington in ''Dynasty'' -- have become even more iconic than Bond girls.</p>
        <p>And the Spelling shows are their own best apologists, after all. Take ''Charlie's Angels.'' There were Farrah, Kate and Jaclyn at the start of each episode, living the feminist dream attending the police academy: karate flips, target practice and running around obstacle courses. Then, alas, the conundrum. They graduate, and as the porno-movie theme music pipes cheerfully away, John Forsythe provides the ironic voice-over for scenes of their ''very hazardous duties'': crossing guard, desk jockey, parking enforcer. ''I took them away from all that, and now they work for me. My name is Charlie.'' Cut to their lives, emancipated by Charlie. So Charlie, who was always being</p>
        <p>primed and pumped by some paramour while reeling off 007-like double-entendres, wasn't to blame for the exploitation of his angels. It was the police academy that didn't recognize the brilliance of Sabrina, Kelly and Jill; he was the one who tapped into their resourcefulness and ability to look fetching morphing into race car drivers, cocktail waitresses or mannequins. ''Charlie's Angels'' was Walter Mitty for women, even if men were tricked into thinking it was jiggle TV for them.</p>
        <p>And who could fault the Mod Squad for snitching when they looked so fashionably angst-ridden doing it? And who could fault the ''Dynasty'' clan for outrageous conspicuous consumption when they were saddled simultaneously with the burden of being rich, so obviously loaded with danger and duplicity? They made up for it with some conspicuous do-goodedness, peaking with the Carousel Ball episode, in which Marvin and Barbara Davis's real-life Carousel Ball was the scene for a Bonfire of the Dynasty, with cameos by Betty and Gerald Ford and Henry Kissinger, whom, Alexis exclaimed, she hadn't seen since Portofino.</p>
        <p>It was Collins who made the show, slipping into the shoulder pads, arched eyebrows and stilettos that another Joan C. warmed up for her 40 years earlier. As Collins and Diahann Carroll, who played a character with the unbelievably soapy name of Dominique Deveraux, explained it, they dressed aggressively and acted aggressively because they were striving businesswomen who were dealing with men on their own turf by their own rules. That unyielding architecture of the ''Dynasty'' look -- Ming the Merciless collars and gilding straight off a rococo commode -- hardly begs for a little cuddle. So what indeed is the point of bringing it back, especially when this round of fortunes is being made by computer geeks -- people whose millions are acquired by not getting out very much? Even Joan Collins now hestitates about donning anything with brocade. (She prefers the Lands' End catalog.) This bunch of ''Dynasty'' togs gets all the references right but lacks the sort of wink and nudge that would make it go down the gullet without sticking.</p>
        <p>So the only excuse for designers -- and again, ''excuse'' is the right word -- is that they authentically yearn for the return of the unapologetic, emasculating woman. The master of the universe in sheep's clothing -- astrakhan, to be exact. There's no doubt that four years of watching Hillary Clinton, the most powerful woman in America, sweetly moue through indignity after indignity has bred a hunger for some bitchiness. This season's clothes are bitch costumes as surely as the gowns at the Carousel Ball, worn by the real-life extras and the cast, were rich-people costumes.</p>
        <p>After all, clothes may make the man, but they really make the bitch.</p>
