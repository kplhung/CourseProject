        <p>TINGLING taste buds, full stomachs and intact wallets result from a visit to the seven-month-old Lemongrass Grill, a Thai bargain in East Patchogue. What was once a Pizza Hut, at 760 Montauk Highway (631-475-8288), is now a serene, subdued spot, serving front-and-center Thai dishes. The assertive flavors of dried chili peppers, lemongrass, coconut milk, coriander seeds, basil and numerous other Thai herbs pervade the peppery preparations.</p>
        <p>The often sizzling, always interesting concoctions are ideally suited for diners who seek jump-off-the-plate-taste-punch rather than for the timid or faint of heart (or mouth). Though there are enough mild dishes to satisfy those who want to avoid the most incendiary possibilities, the menu's hot and spicy designations are not always reliable. A case in point was som tam esan ($4.95), or Thai green papaya salad, slim strands of cucumber-like fruit with tomatoes, chili and lime juice (though missing its promised string beans). Printed in black, it was almost red hot. Tom yum gung ($3.50), a red-listed soup, was what it should be, a savory and spicy, clear chicken broth packing two large shrimp and a commendable kick.</p>

        <p>TINGLING taste buds, full stomachs and intact wallets result from a visit to the seven-month-old Lemongrass Grill, a Thai bargain in East Patchogue.

The assertive flavors of dried chili peppers, lemongrass, coconut milk, coriander seeds, basil and numerous other Thai herbs pervade the peppery preparations.</p>
        <p>The often sizzling, always interesting concoctions are ideally suited for diners who seek jump-off-the-plate-taste-punch rather than for the timid or faint of heart (or mouth). Though there are enough mild dishes to satisfy those who want to avoid the most incendiary possibilities, the menu's hot and spicy designations are not always reliable. A case in point was som tam esan ($4.95), or Thai green papaya salad, slim strands of cucumber-like fruit with tomatoes, chili and lime juice (though missing its promised string beans). Printed in black, it was almost red hot. Tom yum gung ($3.50), a red-listed soup, was what it should be, a savory and spicy, clear chicken broth packing two large shrimp and a commendable kick.</p>
        <p>Other splendid starters were pla muok tod ($4.95), crisp, tender, deep fried squid escorted by a hot, though not overwhelming sauce, dotted with floating cucumber cubes; spring rolls ($3.25), in a feathery wrapper containing bamboo shoots, cabbage, bean threads and carrots with sweet and sour sauce; and a simple mixed green salad ($3.25) with a mellow dressing alive with mashed peanuts.</p>
        <p>Less compelling were four summer rolls ($4.25) that tasted like undressed lettuce in a wrap and yielded a total of one-and-a-half small shrimp and a few rubbery fish cakes and tod mun pla ($4.95), which wasn't particularly explosive-hot despite its red menu warning.</p>
        <p>The exuberant integration of hot, salty, sweet and sour Indian and Chinese flavors that is typical of Thai cooking is most evident at entree time when few missed steps were encountered. A best-buy and best-taste pick is kae mao gai ($6.95), a huge plate brimming with chicken and flat rice noodles, made vibrant by an herbal overlay of fresh basil, onion, pepper and chili. Grilled lemongrass-marinated Siam chicken ($8.95), enhanced by a peppy bed of braised onions, sweet basil and black bean sauce, is an excellent choice, as is stir-fried, ginger chicken ($8.50), a Chinese-restaurant-taste-alike, with its julienned ginger, sprinkle of tiny black beans, mushrooms, onions, pepper and oyster sauce. Nua nam mun hoy ($8.50) is another dish with a familiar Chinese spin. Although its stir-fried beef didn't come medium rare as ordered, the pot-roast-tender meat was given a boost from its black bean, oyster sauce, mushroom, scallion and ginger accompaniments on a spinach base. Another beef choice, nua pad prik ($11.95), a thin grilled, marinated steak, topped with sauteed onions, peppercorns, scallions and kaffir lime leaves, was as tasty and was over done.</p>
        <p>Kratieum prik Thai ($11.95), or nine garlicky shrimp with bamboo shoots, scallions and basil, would have been better without an overload of unannounced green peppers. Pla jean ($13.95), a spice-coated, grilled salmon steak, crowned with ginger slivers and resting in a soy bean, garlic, chili sauce, had an appealing semi-sweet surface but contained tiny bones. Two skinny, grilled pork chops ($8.25), marinated in lemongrass, garlic, galanga and lime juice, proved that this cut need not be thick or prime to be rewarding.</p>
        <p>All three, modestly priced desserts -- coconut cake ($2.95), kao niew ma-muang ($3.95) and fried bananas ($3.50) -- are simple, satisfying sweets. The custardy coconut is refreshing; the kao niew, or fresh sliced mango, with slightly sweet, sticky rice is interesting; and the warming cylinders of ripe, honey- and sesame seed-covered bananas in delicate wrappers are substantial.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>A natural food market and eatery opened on Shelter Island last spring.  Planet Bliss, on Route 114 at 23 North Ferry Road (631-749-0053), a 44-seat restaurant with a porch, is owned by Sebastian Bliss and Julie O'Neill. Mr. Bliss was the sous chef at the Rams Head Inn and operated the Dory, both on Shelter Island. Ms. O'Neill has worked in the fashion industry. The restaurant stresses an organic menu, with entree prices in the $14 to $16 range, offering dishes for meat eaters as well as vegetarians. Organic chickens and pies and breads from the Sullivan Street Bakery in Manhattan are served.</p>
        <p>Kristina's, a Greek-Italian storefront restaurant, opened last month at 3018 Jericho Turnpike in East Northport (631-858-2086). Dinner entrees are in the $10 to $17 bracket at the casual 32-seat spot that will expand to 100 seats when its somewhat more formal dining room opens next month. Steve Troumouhis, the chef and co-owner, was previously at La Serena in Port Washington and Artos in Manhattan. His partner, Harry Agrotis, was the manager of the Ruby Room in Roslyn.</p>
