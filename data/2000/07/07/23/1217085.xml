        <p>TED MACLIN asks disconcerting questions like: ''Where do carrot seeds come from? Did you ever think about that?'' Mr. Maclin, the coordinator of the Children's Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, who looks like a big kid himself (he's 32), had paused by a planting bed to help a 9-year-old figure out how many carrot seedlings should be pulled out of his patch.</p>
        <p>''Thin them to three fingers apart,'' Mr. Maclin said, holding his three middle fingers together, and watching the boy do the same. (Three 9-year-old fingers were just right.) But to get back to that question of seeds. You have this orange carrot root growing underground, O.K.? And it has a carrot top of frilly green leaves, right? So where's the flower that makes the seeds?</p>

        <p>TED MACLIN asks disconcerting questions like: ''Where do carrot seeds come from? Did you ever think about that?'' Mr. Maclin, the coordinator of the Children's Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, who looks like a big kid himself (he's 32), had paused by a planting bed to help a 9-year-old figure out how many carrot seedlings should be pulled out of his patch.</p>
        <p>''Thin them to three fingers apart,'' Mr. Maclin said, holding his three middle fingers together, and watching the boy do the same. (Three 9-year-old fingers were just right.) But to get back to that question of seeds. You have this orange carrot root growing underground, O.K.? And it has a carrot top of frilly green leaves, right? So where's the flower that makes the seeds?</p>
        <p>''Carrots are biennials,'' Mr. Maclin explained. ''If you left it in the ground, it would flower the second year.'' He strolled off to let this puzzling information simmer.</p>
        <p>This garden was started for children in 1913 by Ellen Eddy Shaw, a schoolteacher. ''When I came to Brooklyn, I hoped that all the children might have gardens,'' she said in a 1938 radio interview. The story, recounted in the botanic garden's records, tells how she asked teachers to distribute seeds to children in poor sections of the city.</p>
        <p>Miss Shaw's was the first public children's garden in the United States, and its principles of team spirit, inquisitiveness and independent thinking are still thriving, as youths, from 3 to 17, grow everything from carrots to sugar cane in the one-acre garden. Fees for the children are $65 to $75 a month.</p>
        <p>Kinder Gardeners (3- to 6-year-olds) plant surefire crops like radishes, marigolds and lettuce in communal beds. City Farmers (7 to 12)  team up in pairs to tend 4-by-15-foot plots; Earth Movers (13 to 17) develop group projects, like a wheel-shaped garden with paths as the ''spokes.'' The shadow of a 20-foot bamboo pole in the center moves around the beds, acting as a sun dial.</p>
        <p>''The high school kids are doing a project with bacteria culture,'' Mr. Maclin said. ''They go around with a sterile Q-Tip and rub it on a plant, or on the sink, or on their nose. They do a culture and come back in a week to see what's growing.'' The children, with a bit of supervision, dug the foot-deep fish-shaped pond and planted the species gladiolus (a gorgeous deep red), which they had seen in a magazine. ''So we went over to the garden shop and bought one,'' Mr. Maclin said.</p>
        <p>I went to this beehive of learning to pick up tips for grown-ups who want to share their love of the earth with children. It's simple, really.</p>
        <p>Listen to children's ideas (the red gladiolus, for example). Help them get the materials, but let them do the work, as they did with their own idea of building a curving bamboo trellis for the luffa vines and beans.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing what they can do,'' Mr. Maclin said. ''I don't have a problem with kids using a saw, or wire cutters, as long as there's a supervisor.'' Good gardening involves a lot of practical skills, like driving stakes into the ground and building sturdy trellises and fences.  ''A big part is giving kids responsibility,'' he said. ''Kids crave responsibility.'' The hard part is standing back. ''Parents have a tendency to do too much for the kids,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maclin watched a little girl jam a canna plant -- the green-striped Pretoria -- into her garden. The root ball still sat above ground.</p>
        <p>''Do you want some advice?'' Mr. Maclin asked. She nodded. ''I'd plant it a little deeper.'' She scraped at the hole with her trowel.</p>
        <p>''Some kids don't want advice,'' he said. ''It's like telling an artist to add more shadow to this corner of the painting.''</p>
        <p>Two 9-year-olds, Evan Meisler and Jamil Ward, were busy staking their cherry tomato plant. ''We picked a tomato, but it wasn't ripe,'' Evan said. ''We like to plant things we can eat.'' Jamil showed off the little yellow squash under the big leaves, a wilted flower attached to its rounded end. Jamil already knew which kind of flower made the squash: ''A female flower,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There's a little kitchen in the garden cottage, where children make pesto from the basil they grow, spaghetti sauce and gazpacho from the tomatoes and peppers.</p>
        <p>If you don't have space, grow basil, mint and ginger root in pots, Mr. Maclin suggested. ''It's a big deal if the salad dressing has your basil,'' he said. ''Or if the Chinese stir-fry has your ginger.'' The tropical garden has a huge sugar cane plant, a banana, a papaya and a castor bean plant, whose seeds are poisonous.</p>
        <p>''We grow some poisonous plants,'' Mr. Maclin said. ''Because I don't want the kids to get the idea they can eat just anything.''</p>
        <p>It's time now to plant seeds for fall crops, like beans, squash, cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli.</p>
        <p>''You could even plant a pumpkin, which takes 100 days,'' Mr. Maclin said. August, September, October. Just in time for Halloween. Or pie for Thanksgiving. ''There's so little space in the city, parents often don't want to give up any to their kids,'' he added. ''But a pumpkin is just beautiful, even in an ornamental garden. And this can be the kids' spot.''</p>
