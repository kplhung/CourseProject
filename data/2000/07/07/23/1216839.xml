        <p>FORGET DVD players, Internet access and fitness centers. A small but growing number of hotels now offer their guests the latest must-have amenity: private screening rooms. No mere conference room equipped with folding chairs and a big-screen TV, these are luxurious, state-of-the-art projection rooms -- with goodies like surround sound and leather seats -- which guests can rent to screen 35-millimeter and digitally transmitted film, the kind of footage normally handled only by studio production facilities or the local multiplex.</p>
        <p>The hotels with such facilities include the recently opened Tribeca Grand and the Bryant Park, to open this fall, both in New York; the Bacara Resort and Spa set to open in Santa Barbara this fall; and several London hotels. ''Our guests are very media savvy,'' said Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, the owners and developers of the Tribeca Grand and its 100-seat Grand Screen. ''Given the demand for screening rooms these days, it's already generating a lot of traffic in the hotel.''</p>

        <p>FORGET DVD players, Internet access and fitness centers. A small but growing number of hotels now offer their guests the latest must-have amenity: private screening rooms. No mere conference room equipped with folding chairs and a big-screen TV, these are luxurious, state-of-the-art projection rooms -- with goodies like surround sound and leather seats -- which guests can rent to screen 35-millimeter and digitally transmitted film, the kind of footage normally handled only by studio production facilities or the local multiplex.</p>
        <p>The hotels with such facilities include the recently opened Tribeca Grand and the Bryant Park, to open this fall, both in New York; the Bacara Resort and Spa set to open in Santa Barbara this fall; and several London hotels. ''Our guests are very media savvy,'' said Emanuel Stern, president of Hartz Mountain Industries, the owners and developers of the Tribeca Grand and its 100-seat Grand Screen. ''Given the demand for screening rooms these days, it's already generating a lot of traffic in the hotel.''</p>
        <p>The hotel screening rooms offer not only professional projection equipment but also  stylish quarters suitable for private receptions. Food and beverage service is available; the Tribeca Grand even has a candy and popcorn concession stand.</p>
        <p>Such luxury does not come cheap, how ever. Rentals, for guests and nonguests alike, are $105 an hour at One Aldwych in London, $400 an hour at the Tribeca Grand (with a minimum of two and half hours).</p>
        <p>What kind of hotel guests want -- or need -- access to professional screening facilities? The answer includes film production companies, Wall Street firms, Hollywood professionals and John Q. Public -- anyone who wants to show 35-millimeter reels, digitized film or even a rented DVD disc to a group of friends or colleagues. One Aldwych, which raised the curtain on its new 30-seat screening room in March 1999, has seen its facilities used by companies like Miramax and Goldman, Sachs, which have been hosts at private press screenings and corporate training sessions. Individual guests have also rented the luxurious navy blue silk-and-leather arena. ''One bloke used it to screen a romantic movie and propose to his girlfriend,'' said Clare Bradshaw, the U.S. spokeswoman for the hotel.</p>
        <p>The Bacara, less than two hours north of Los Angeles, expects its 220-seat screening room to be a home away from home for Hollywood professionals. Vacationing directors and producers will be able to look at dailies (production footage), and the local Santa Barbara Film Festival will have access to another venue. Randy Gantenbein, president and chief executive officer of the Bacara, said, ''We see it as a way for Hollywood professionals to get out of the frenzy and yet still do business.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the $1.5 million, 100-seat screening room at the Tribeca Grand, in the heart of Manhattan's independent film district, has already found a receptive audience among the neighborhood's many production companies, Mr. Stern said. He added that individual guests had also used the room, which can broadcast live televised events, for birthday parties and sports gatherings. Before the hotel opened, he said, ''I even used it to watch Knicks games.''</p>
