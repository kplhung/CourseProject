        <p>Sex and Real Estate</p>
        <p>Why We Love Houses.</p>
        <p>By Marjorie Garber.</p>
        <p>243 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $23.</p>
        <p>SCOUR the ranks of academia, even the annals of American letters: you'd be hard pressed to find a scholar whose publishing career is more eclectic than that of Marjorie Garber. Trained as a Shakespeare scholar (and tenured at Harvard), she has in the last decade produced flawlessly timed academic crossover books on cross-dressing, bisexuality and dogs -- make that dog love -- in addition to a collection of diverse critical essays. Previously, one might have wondered how she managed to explore such a wide variety of topics. Until you pick up her latest book, that is. After even a cursory glance at the first few pages of ''Sex and Real Estate,'' the pressing question becomes: How does Marjorie Garber manage to get any work done at all, given the enormous amount of time and energy that she devotes to her true passion -- house lust?</p>
        <p>Professor Garber has it bad. She reads the weekly property listings as though they were adult literature; she takes her partner to open houses for purely voyeuristic titillation; she entertains impure thoughts about antique shutters; holding paint chips in her hot little hands, she wanders past clapboard houses and, when no one is looking, runs up and strokes them longingly.</p>
        <p>Assuming, somewhat perilously, that this fixation is shared by all members of her generation -- a form of yuppie pornography'' -- she sets out in ''Sex and Real Estate'' to tease out the cultural roots of this collective yearning.</p>
        <p>Somewhere beneath all of her overheated, confessional prose, and lurking behind the very salable title (combining two ''of the most erotic terms in the language''), is a smart, simple book that would have been quite enjoyable to read: a study of the complex image of the house in various historical and literary texts. Garber is at her best when she cools off and takes herself out of the picture. Reading novels and how-to guides of the mid-1800's, she observes the way ''mother'' and ''home'' came to stand in for each other -- how motherhood was figured as a sheltering structure analogous to, and then identical with, a home itself, the place where mothers inscribed their nurturing values on society. And that maternalized ''home'' proved to be a handy political tool -- like ''family'' today, it is an emotionally resonant term available for appropriation for an almost limitless array of public agendas.</p>
        <p>But a book based on only those kinds of readings would have been published by a university press and would have performed respectably among an academic audience. In ''Sex and Real Estate,'' Garber has mixed those more scholarly elements in with a diverse array of pop cultural references, swirling them together in a big, lively whorl. The effect -- as she zips in rapid succession from ''Brideshead Revisited'' to ''Boston-area sidewalk artist Alfred Mira'' to ''Emma'' to ''Much Ado About Nothing'' to her own purchasing patterns to psychoanalytic musing to the film ''The War of the Roses'' to The Wall Street Journal -- is more dizzying than persuasive. And the contemporary references that she marshals -- breezy though they may be -- can seem shaky. She gives curious prominence to the lesser films of Steve Martin (''Housesitter'' and ''Father of the Bride, Part 2''). And when she claims as sociological fact that the old custom of carrying a bride over the threshold ''has been succeeded by a new 'custom': nowadays couples 'initiate' each room of the house or apartment, or each substantial new piece of furniture, by making love in them or on them (or, in the case of dining room tables, under them)'' -- she ought to include, at the very least, a footnote.</p>
        <p>She does manage to assemble an impressive, and often hilarious, array of erotically overcharged real estate come-ons that attempt to sell homes as either romantic aids or partners in their own right. But she all but ignores the fact that far from being specific to the field, sexual satisfaction is the trope by which just about every consumer item is sold, from designer clothing to that shampoo that's supposed to make you shriek in ecstasy. And in any case, the premise soon wears thin. Within the space of five pages, we get lines like: ''When you stop to think about it, buying and selling a house is a lot like dating''; ''Sometimes house-buying (and house-selling) is like going on a blind date''; ''Falling in love with a house can be like starting an affair.'' Seven chapters later, she observes: ''Second homes and vacation homes can be like love affairs and second marriages.'' And so on.</p>
        <p>By the time she gets to her final chapter, about summer houses, even she seems to have lost interest in her larger intellectual project. ''Let's face it,'' she begins, sounding distinctly impatient, ''When you're 17, you dream of a summer romance. When you're 47 . . . you dream of a summer home.'' Any questions? Good.</p>
        <p>No longer trying to construct a broadly based cultural analysis, she winds up cataloging the charming idiosyncrasies of the rich. ''When it comes to naming your house in Britain, 'cottage' and 'bungalow' still dominate the field. A survey by the nation's largest mortgage provider, the Halifax, disclosed that The Cottage is the nation's most popular house name, followed by The Bungalow (the national favorite five years earlier) and Rose Cottage, a perennial winner. 'Cottages' (Willow-, April-, Pear Tree-, Ivy-, Yew Tree-, Orchard- and Holly-) easily outnumbered 'houses,' 'villas,' 'manors,' 'rectories' and 'farms.' ''She regards their domestic tics (such as their desire to ascribe a vague moral benefit to rustic decor) with a knowing detachment, but no more so than the more clever shelter books themselves, which show their subscribers how to feel ironic, rather than gullible, about all the shiny hand-finished surfaces they are nonetheless told to covet.</p>
        <p>But for all her attention to marketing, Garber never gets around to what ought to be the most obvious reason so many Americans are obsessed with real estate: shelter has become phenomenally expensive and, even for those increasingly few who can afford it, tremendously difficult to acquire. Members of the professional class cram into the Lower East Side tenements their immigrant grandparents were happy to move out of, while working-class people are priced out of the market entirely. Surely that plays at least as big a role as any salacious sales pitch in turning otherwise well-rounded people into real estate obsessives. And surely a book on this subject that fails even to consider that fact is built on a weak foundation indeed.</p>
