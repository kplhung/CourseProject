        <p>TO KILL THE POPE</p>
        <p>An Ecclesiastical Thriller.</p>
        <p>By Tad Szulc.</p>
        <p>Scribner, $25.</p>
        <p>When a Turkish gunman tried to kill John Paul II in May of 1981, hypotheses flew like startled pigeons over St. Peter's Square. Some sources claimed Islamic fundamentalists were behind the shooting, while others pointed fingers at the Bulgarian secret police and the Kremlin. Tad Szulc, a foreign and diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times from 1955 to 1972, has written a fictional treatment of that assassination attempt that features a controversial French pope named Gregory XVII who, like John Paul II, was shot in May of 1981; Szulc proposes that the attempt was mounted by French Catholic fundamentalists opposed to the pope's plans for church modernization. Szulc has couched his assertions in fictional form, he notes in an afterword, in order to to cloak the identities of Vatican insiders who conducted a secret investigation of the assassination attempt and whose work he learned of while writing his 1995 biography of the pope. The novel's hero, Father Tim Savage, is the kind of priest who has an eye for pretty nuns like his assistant, Sister Angela. Though his search for the gunman's paymasters takes him to Istanbul, Paris and elsewhere, he can't get her out of his mind, and before long their budding romance becomes the best part of the book. (The passages on church history can be sleep-inducing, and many of Father Tim's flat-footed attempts at espionage would leave James Bond gasping with laughter.) If the reader is convinced that French clergymen tried to kill the pope and that the Vatican concealed its knowledge of the crime to maintain church unity, then it makes sense that Tim and Angela return to secular life at the end rather than be part of such an institution. But a more compelling reason is that they simply can't keep their mitts off each other.</p>
