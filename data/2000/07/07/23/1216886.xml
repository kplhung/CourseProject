        <p>HIS brush strokes keep time with the rumble of the roller coaster and the rhythms of a five-piece band. All around him, the big amusement park by the beach is in full swing.</p>
        <p>Red-haired clowns dance with sunburned children. Arcade games ring and buzz, with winners clutching stuffed frogs and other prizes. Thrill seekers defy gravity on a new ride that blasts screaming passengers up an 85-foot tower in less than two seconds.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the hubbub, under an oak tree on a patch of sidewalk, is Metin Acar (pronounced: mitten ajar), using pen and ink and watercolors to create portraits of people's faces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acar has spent each summer for the past three decades perfecting his artistic skills, and his powers of concentration, at this 40-acre amusement park on the banks of Long Island Sound. Mr. Acar, who has been in the same spot all these years, is an artist with a local following: patrons return season after season to get sketches of their children made; then they take those drawings home and hang them up alongside pictures Mr. Acar drew of them when they were young.</p>
        <p>''Because of him I went to Art and Design High School,'' said Rafael DelaCruz, 39, of the Bronx, who passed Mr. Acar's green easel one recent Thursday afternoon and recalled childhood days he spent roaming Playland.</p>
        <p>For Mr. DelaCruz, a Con Edison gas mechanic who still draws in his spare time, the mystique of the park went beyond the countless hot dogs he ate and the rides he took on the Spider. Mostly, he remembers watching the intense artist with the green eyes, spectacles, European clothes and shaggy hair.</p>
        <p>''I used to come here four or five times a month, and there was not one time I came when he wasn't here,'' he said. ''He was always in the same corner.''</p>
        <p>Some of the attractions at Playland have changed over the years. The prices to climb aboard the rides have steadily increased, by about 30 percent since 1980. The roller coaster has been replaced and renamed four times. It started as a rumbling wooden coaster called the Aeroplane. Then it became the Monster Mouse, getting a new steel grid. In the late 70's, it became the Wildcat. And now it is called the Hurricane.</p>
        <p>But a mainstay from generation to generation has been Mr. Acar, 68, a native of Turkey who came to the United States in 1964. In the off season, Mr. Acar, who is an oil and watercolorist by trade, returns to Europe.</p>
        <p>''Whenever we've been in Istanbul, people just jump out at him,'' said Lorna McIntyre, a longtime friend of Mr. Acar's, reached in her home in Bradenton, Fla. ''He draws crowds. He is very well known over there. I would say he is famous.''</p>
        <p>Besides putting on exhibitions here and abroad, Mr. Acar also spent many years in New York City doing art restorations, bringing back to life paintings, painted chinoiserie furniture and antique dufour wallpaper murals owned by the likes of Nelson A. Rockefeller.</p>
        <p>All that work, while meaningful, tired Mr. Acar. And the pay wasn't great, he said. But the Playland portraits bring him joy, even if some may look down at a carnival artist.</p>
        <p>''I don't care,'' he said. '''m happy like this. This is simple. I feel better when I am doing little things. I try to make something to make people happy.''</p>
        <p>His basic price for a sketch is $12 for children, $15 for adults. Erol and Sevgi Gursel, fellow Turks who live in New Rochelle, met Mr. Acar in the early 1960's. The Gursels say they have the best of Mr. Acar's works at home. They own four oil paintings, including a favorite scene of old houses along the Bosporus, the strait that joins the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and they own a portrait he drew of Ms. Gursel.</p>
        <p>''He did exactly my image,'' she said. ''It doesn't change me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Acar said he has been lucky. For him, there has never been anything but art.</p>
        <p>''From when I was 7 years old, I started to paint,'' he said. ''Usually a teacher. Flowers. Some Turkish general. I would look at the history of the Ottoman Empire.''</p>
        <p>In 1950, Mr. Acar finished high school, joined the Turkish merchant marine, sailed Europe on a commercial ship for three years and came back to enroll in Istanbul's fine arts academy. There he grew to love Rembrandt and Claude Monet for the way  their paintings portray dark and light.</p>
        <p>After four years of study, Mr. Acar got various odd jobs doing interior design work for companies in Turkey. But he was soon stricken with wanderlust, and on a trip to a travel agency to book a flight for Scandinavia he met a woman named Nihal. She married him after a three-month courtship and took him to America in 1964.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acar could not speak English very well. So, he took his pens and paints and set up shop at the World's Fair, in Flushing, Queens. He didn't need to speak much English, he found, and he could earn a good living, he said. But the job lasted just six short months.</p>
        <p>That is when his wife, Nihal Senol (the couple, who raised two children, has since divorced) realized her husband was itching to do more of what he loved. She had befriended Edward Kilcullen, the former Playland park director, in the late 1960's, and Mr. Kilcullen gave Mr. Acar his job, first on weekends only and then every day the park was open between May and October.</p>
        <p>''The caricatures he makes, people are very happy with them,'' said Ms. Senol, reached by phone in the resort town of Bodrum, Turkey, on the Aegean Sea. ''He loves young people. He is a very softhearted man, very affectionate.''</p>
        <p>In one two-hour period one recent day, Mr. Acar drew a picture of 2-year-old Stella Song of Yonkers, as she balanced on her mother's knee. He drew curly haired 5-year-old Genesis Nunez of the Bronx, as her father, Victor, sat across from her and made funny faces. And he drew Anazia Davis, 5, and her 11-month-old brother, Anthony, one after another.</p>
        <p>The siblings were frowning at first. Then they saw Mr. Acar's work and shyly smiled. Mr. Acar gave Anazia a puppy in her portrait and put Anthony on a skateboard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acar sighed, slowly straightening up from a crouched position he maintains while drawing, and lighted another Parliament. Thin and still in good physical shape, he wiped the sweat from his brow, inhaled and smiled.</p>
        <p>''Doing these quick sketches gives him a tremendous sense of satisfaction and enjoyment,'' Ms. McIntyre said. ''The same people keep coming back year after year, and they bring their children and their children's children.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. DelaCruz and his wife, Wanda, Mr. Acar drew a picture that the couple agreed was 20 years overdue. They came on a date to Playland in 1979, a year before they were married, but never stopped to sit in Mr. Acar's chair. Now, they plan to frame the artist's sketch of them and put it over the mantle next to their wedding picture at home in Hunts Point.</p>
        <p>''I love it,'' Ms. DelaCruz said, gazing at the finished product. ''He really captured me. Not everyone can capture me that way.''</p>
