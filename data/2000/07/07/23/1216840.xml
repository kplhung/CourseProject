        <p>IT is hard to admit to being a soccer mom. That cliched title is easier to bear, however, when the games are played on a crescent moon of a beach in Brazil, where the team kicks up sand as white and soft as baby powder.</p>
        <p>Our family loves soccer, that jogo bonito, ''beautiful game,'' as they call it in Brazil. My son John, 14, has played since kindergarten, and his coach, Paulo Barreto, is a Brazilian who played professionally there. His Cincinnati company, Paulo's Brazilian Soccer Training and Camp, began organizing trips last year to his hometown, Florianopolis.</p>
        <p>The coin toss to see whether my husband, John, or I would accompany John on a trip there last March was agonizing. Not only was the trip too expensive for everyone to go, but we would have had to take our two younger children out of school. I won.</p>
        <p>This particular eight-day trip was designed for a team, but not all of John's team, the Cincinnati Classics, participated, so they were supplemented by other boys and girls of the same age and ability from around Cincinnati. Parents were welcome, and of the 17 players, only 5 traveled without a parent, making us a group of 39.</p>
        <p>Other camps offer various levels of training and can include international tournament play for players who hope to play at the college level and beyond, but this trip offered the right balance of soccer and vacation for us. Our trip revolved around three matches with local teams and four morning training sessions, but equally important was the beachfront hotel and organized afternoon sightseeing.</p>
        <p>Florianopolis, on the island of Santa Catarina, is about 350 miles down the coast from Sao Paulo. Our 24-hour trip was not made easier by the way we were routed by the travel agency -- through Detroit, Miami and Sao Paulo -- but the teenagers seemed oblivious to the inconvenience. When they weren't giving water to thirsty dogs in travel cages or bumping into airport police officers on bikes, they managed to find enough open space at each stopover to kick around a soccer ball. In Sao Paulo, they sprawled over the floor of the airport terminal, lounging or sleeping on backpacks.</p>
        <p>Several in our group thought the island of Santa Catarina, on which most of the city of Florianopolis is built, looked like one of the islands of Hawaii from the air. The hilly countryside is laden with subtropical flora, and both land and sea are dotted with ancient black boulders that must have looked like gods to the Tupi-Guarani Indians who first inhabited the region. The island is connected to the mainland by two bridges, although one, the Hercilio Luz, is closed to motor traffic.</p>
        <p>Our bright blue hotel, the Ingleses Praia, sat beside a beach called Praia dos Ingleses, on the northeast shore of the island, about 22 miles from downtown Florianopolis. The beach was named for English explorers who poked around there about 1700. Each room had a balcony, cool tile floors, air-conditioning and surprisingly spacious bathrooms.</p>
        <p>We ate breakfast and occasionally another meal at the hotel, buffet style. Fruits and juices were fresh and delicious, but all else paled in the morning before the coffee. It was deeply rich and black, served with hot milk.</p>
        <p>Our first evening at the hotel, the parents in the group were content to laze wearily on the veranda, drinking caipirinhas, a lime drink usually made with cachaca, Brazilian sugar-cane liquor. A few of the boys perused the small strip of beachfront restaurants and souvenir shops selling T-shirts and crocheted bikinis and thongs on either side of the hotel (their favorite souvenirs were fake designer watches, but because the dollar is strong against the real, almost everything seemed inexpensive).</p>
        <p>Afterward, they brought out a ball and began to kick it around on the beach under the stars. This attracted some local people and soon a full fledged game was on. Not one Brazilian guy walking along the beach -- student, vendor or fisherman -- could keep his foot off the ball if it came near him during our practices, and their skill was remarkable.</p>
        <p>The team's first training session was at the Hotel Fazenda Jomar on the mainland near Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, a spa town founded to commemorate an imperial visit in 1845 by Dom Pedro II, emperor of Brazil. Having traveled inland 18 miles, we were in dense green mountains, and the group practiced on a field in danger of being enveloped by the lush vegetation surrounding it.</p>
        <p>Afterward, we all took advantage of the resort's amenities. The team swam in the pool, went rafting in rapids not rapid enough to be classified, and sank paddle boats in the lake.</p>
        <p>On a shaded veranda, an accordionist played German music, a reminder of the large influx of Germans who emigrated to this part of Brazil in the 19th century. Several parents joined an ecological walk around the grounds, which led to a waterfall of rare beauty; on our way up, we disturbed a lizard the size of a small alligator.</p>
        <p>Florianopolis has two professional soccer teams, the Figueirense Futebol Clube, based on the mainland, and the island's Avai Futebol Clube, both of which cultivate players from a young age. After a day of practice and a couple of scrimmages on the beach, our first match took place against the Figueirense youth team in the club's stadium in Florianopolis. The Brazilians, who were a year or two older than John,  won, 8-1, which did not seem to diminish the excitement of playing a challenging opponent.</p>
        <p>Our game with the young Avai team two days later took place just before the professional match between Avai and Caxias (from the city of Porto Alegre). As the game went on, the stands filled up with fans who cheered on both teams (we lost, 2-0) but who were unforgiving of their pro team when it lost.</p>
        <p>After the game with Figueirense, our bus took us to the beach at Joaquina, which is on the east side of the island and is famous for surfing championships held there each year. After an open-air lunch, the team wandered the beach, climbing the huge rocks at one end and examining jellyfish that washed onto the shore.</p>
        <p>Behind Praia da Joaquina are massive sand dunes of Saharan proportion and, even though the wind whipped up the sand so fiercely it practically blinded them, the team was determined to go sandboarding. John and the boys happily forged their way up the dunes over and over again, and dumped their weight in sand onto the floor of the bus on the way back to the hotel.</p>
        <p>The next day, we boarded a schooner and headed for the island of Anhatomirim, where the team was to practice in the shadow of the Santa Cruz fort, built in 1744. A Brazilian school group about the same age as ours happened to be touring the fort, too, and it wasn't long before another impromptu match was on.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian girls watched the American boys with obvious pleasure, much to the consternation of the Brazilian boys, which gave the game an edge it might not ordinarily have had. The Brazilian boys, on the other hand, didn't know what to make of the four highly skilled girls playing on our team. Only the parents were in awe of the setting: on one side a centuries-old fortress and on the other, the magnificent sea.</p>
        <p>After morning training another day, the group ventured downtown. The two bridges to the mainland shadow 19th-century ocher-colored market buildings along the old waterfront. Across the street from the Praca 15 de Novembro, the city's main square, John stopped at the entrance to the pink Cruz e Souza Palace to have his picture taken beside the guard, who wore an elaborate uniform and held a rifle with a bayonet. The team climbed the steps to the bright white Metropolitan Cathedral, where a Mass was being said, then plopped down pretending to be exhausted.</p>
        <p>Since this day of sightseeing had little appeal for them, the high point of the excursion was stopping at a shop called Futebol Mania to buy official Figueirense and Avai jerseys. A few fathers wandered off to the bus station to find Cuban cigars.</p>
        <p>Our meals outside the hotel were in seafood restaurants or in churrascarias, places serving meat smorgasbords called rodizio (all you can eat). Seafood lunches were waterside, in open-air restaurants that served us at long communal tables -- local shrimp in butter and oil, mussels in salsa, deep-fried whitefish, served with plates of beets, shredded carrots and tomato, clay pots of rich black beans, and crisp, deep-fried manioc root. When Mr. Barreto realized that our ravenous American teenagers kept passing on the plates of fish and making faces, he arranged that they be served chicken with rice and French fries instead.</p>
        <p>One evening we were taken to a cafe colonial, a Brazilian-style high tea inspired by the customs of European immigrants in the 19th century. On the beach, we snacked on corn on the cob served in the husk and drank cool milk right from coconuts. The team's favorite drink was Guarana, sweet green soda with lots of caffeine.</p>
        <p>A cultural exchange had been arranged for us the afternoon before we left at the Colegia Energia, a private school in Florianopolis that prides itself on its English instruction. When we arrived, we were met with wild cheers, as if we were a busload of American movie stars. Our boys were a little stunned at such a reception and we had to remind them to keep smiling.</p>
        <p>The school had prepared a short program and presented each of our team members with souvenir notebooks. A soccer scrimmage was held in which our girls soundly beat four Brazilian girls. While our boys were outclassed on the field, they were mobbed by Brazilian girls and boys asking for e-mail addresses and photographs. Once our team got used to the attention, those who spoke a little Spanish -- none spoke Portuguese -- tried to talk to the students, who answered in their halting English.</p>
        <p>That evening, we lost our last match, against the Astel Futebol Clube, but only by a single goal. Once, John collided with an Astel player, knocking him to the ground. As he would have back home, he reached down to help the Brazilian to his feet, but was scolded by Mr. Barreto.</p>
        <p>''Here you leave him alone,'' he said. ''Find him after the game if you want.''</p>
        <p>When we returned to Cincinnati, the team went on to become division champions, at least partly because of improved soccer skills. But the trip had also provided the players with a surprise, the opportunity to represent their country by their actions: how they played the game did matter.</p>
