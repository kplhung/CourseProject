        <p>The Giants drafted Joe Jurevicius two years ago to become the team's third receiver, a pivotal assignment as the Giants try to expand and diversify what has been a predictable passing attack.</p>
        <p>A former teammate of Giants quarterback Kerry Collins's at Penn State, Jurevicius has been a focus of the team's off-season program, with Collins and the Giants' coaches working daily to try to inspire Jurevicius to improve his play after two lackluster seasons.</p>
        <p>Jurevicius has gotten the message, and has brought a zeal to this year's training camp that was noticeable after even one practice.</p>
        <p>''It's about learning and maturing,'' Jurevicius, 25, said today as the Giants began their workouts.</p>
        <p>Jurevicius' role in a July 1 incident also helped him recognize the career opportunity before him.</p>
        <p>''It made me count my blessings,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jurevicius was among the people who helped pull victims from a collapsed terrace at an island winery on Lake Erie earlier this month. Seventy-five people were injured and one person killed when the 25-by-20-foot terrace gave way.</p>
        <p>''I was sitting on a picnic table not too far away,'' said Jurevicius, who visited the Lonz Winery in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, with Steve Zahursky, a lineman with the Cleveland Browns. Jurevicius, who grew up in the Cleveland area, has been friends with Zahursky since the two were teenagers.</p>
        <p>''Some people came over and asked if we could help,'' Jurevicius said. ''People were trapped under big pieces of concrete. I just started carrying people out of the rubble. There were a lot of people doing whatever they could -- getting stretchers, getting ice, just trying to pull people to safety.</p>
        <p>''It was just instinct, but it sure wakes you up. I wish it didn't happen, but it certainly makes you realize what's important. You can be sitting somewhere with your family and friends and in an instant your life can change tragically. Yeah, it's true that life went on for me afterward, but I appreciate what I have a little more. Something like that reminds you of that.''</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 5 inches and 230 pounds, Jurevicius would seem to be the prototypical third-down possession receiver, especially because he has enough speed to get downfield. But Jurevicius has been inconsistent -- he dropped three passes in one game against Washington last year. In the last two seasons, teammates said Jurevicius was not always running his pass routes precisely, and his dedication in practice was questioned, too.</p>
        <p>These are, incidentally, all the same things people in football said about Amani Toomer after his first two seasons with the Giants. Toomer blossomed in his third year after an off-season during which he seemed to renew his commitment to the game. The Giants are now hoping Jurevicius goes through a similar transformation.</p>
        <p>''I've had a lot to learn,'' Jurevicius said. ''The pro game is different from the college game. It takes time. I'm more comfortable and in the routine now. I don't expect to ever drop three passes in one game again, but if I do, I'm not going to let it get me down and let it have a domino effect on my season like it did last year.''</p>
        <p>Having Collins leading the Giants offense has not hurt either.</p>
        <p>''Kerry's not afraid to tell me anything, and that helps,'' Jurevicius said.</p>
        <p>What Jurevicius means is that Collins will scold him if he thinks it is needed. In a training-camp practice last year, Collins ran across the field to scream at Jurevicius for running the wrong pattern.</p>
        <p>When Jurevicius tried to argue, Collins said, ''No, Joe, you're wrong.''</p>
        <p>Said Collins later: ''I can dog-cuss somebody like Joe. I know him; it's not a problem.''</p>
        <p>Jurevicius said he understood.</p>
        <p>''Kerry's a teacher and I'm a student,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, the book is still out on the talented but enigmatic Jurevicius.</p>
        <p>''Joe has worked really hard to make something good happen,'' Coach Jim Fassel said. ''But it's time for him to have a breakout year.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>It seems to happen every year. The Giants open camp and some player arrives with a previously undisclosed serious injury. Last year it was JASON SEHORN, who had a torn hamstring. This year it's the kick returner and cornerback BASHIR LEVINGSTON, who will miss at least six weeks after having surgery on his left ankle to remove bone chips and stabilize cartilage in the joint. Levingston played well enough this spring in Amsterdam to make the All-Star team of the National Football League's European league, but he missed Amsterdam's final game and had the surgery July 7. Levingston was expected to be the Giants' main kickoff return man. That job will probably fall to RON DIXON, the third-round pick from Lambuth University.</p>
        <p>Linebacker JESSIE ARMSTEAD, who has had some knee troubles in recent seasons, participated in just one of the two Saturday practices. Coach JIM FASSEL said he was resting Armstead and called it ''purely preventative.'' Tight end PETE MITCHELL, who has had ankle problems, also worked out just once.</p>
        <p>The club's starting center, DUSTY ZEIGLER, left Saturday's afternoon practice after being poked in the eye. Fassel said he did not think the injury was serious.</p>
