        <p>Helen, the heroine of Anna Maxted's single-girl saga, ''Getting Over It'' (Regan Books), might not be cool enough to do any credit card damage at the trendy London store Shop, but the author certainly is. A 20-something features' editor at GirlTime magazine, Helen wears only black, which is appropriate because she is also mourning her father's recent death. By contrast, Ms. Maxted, 31, has cultivated a hip literary uniform of trousers, Agnes B. cardigan and high-heels. ''If I feel short, I don't feel ready to face the world,'' said Ms. Maxted, who is 5 foot 1. ''Heels give me inspiration to write.''</p>
        <p>For her book party last week in Manhattan at Serena, she imported a bit of style from London, her home base, buying her fuchsia tank top with scalloped trim and Earl jeans at Shop, a Soho boutique filled with Japanese designs, which is a favorite among celebrities and fashion editors.</p>

        <p>''People who don't know the reality of writing imagine you to look like Meryl Streep in the movie 'She-Devil,' with a pink boa and large hat,'' Ms. Maxted said. Without going that far, she added glamour with a pair of pink snakeskin mules from Un Dimanche a Venise, a Paris store. ''I was trying to look cooler than I actually am,'' Ms. Maxted said. ''Otherwise, I look 13 years old.''</p>
