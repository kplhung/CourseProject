        <p>Downtown South Orange will soon have an arts center with a 340-seat stage and a five-screen movie theater. Construction of the $10 million project, which has been in the works for three years, will begin in November next to the train station bordered by South Orange Avenue and Sloan Street, according to Bill Calabrese, the village president. The 32,000-square-foot space will house a banquet hall for classes, rehearsals and small productions during the week, and social events on the weekends, in addition to the live stage and the movie theater, which will show art and children's films as well as commercial pictures. Along with some state money and private donations, Essex County has pledged $5.4 million with an additional $3 million coming from the federal government. A nonprofit organization will be created to run the center, headed by a board, which will be appointed by Mr. Calabrese and the town's board of trustees. While the town has not accepted gifts in return for naming buildings, officials would like to see an endowment formed from private money. The New Jersey State Opera and Seton Hall University have expressed interest in using the space.</p>
