        <p>The canoe, anchored at the head of Moore's Pool, rocked like a cradle in the gentle grasp of the Upsalquitch River. The morning, the last one of my annual trip to Maclennan Lodge, the camp where I have fished for Atlantic salmon for 19 years without missing a season, was overcast.</p>
        <p>The air was still and leaden, magnifying every sound: the rhythmic swishing of an airborne fly-line; the lapping of the river against the old wooden boat; the abrupt, piercing shriek of a blue jay. I had not yet caught a salmon on this trip, and time was running out.</p>

        <p>The canoe, anchored at the head of Moore's Pool, rocked like a cradle in the gentle grasp of the Upsalquitch River. The morning, the last one of my annual trip to Maclennan Lodge, the camp where I have fished for Atlantic salmon for 19 years without missing a season, was overcast.</p>
        <p>The air was still and leaden, magnifying every sound: the rhythmic swishing of an airborne fly-line; the lapping of the river against the old wooden boat; the abrupt, piercing shriek of a blue jay. I had not yet caught a salmon on this trip, and time was running out.</p>
        <p>Ollie Marshall, my guide and friend, sat square-shouldered at the downstream, stern end, of the boat, watching the Green Machine wet fly swing around in the current.</p>
        <p>''Awful quiet,'' Ollie finally observed. ''Looks like the salmon left with Tucker.''</p>
        <p>''You think?''</p>
        <p>''Naw,'' he said, examining a fingernail as if it were the first time he saw one. ''Tucker loved being wicked, but he wouldn't do that to us.''</p>
        <p>After a while, Ollie added, ''It's the evenings, after the fishing, that I miss Tucker most. My God, how we all used to laugh, sitting around the table in the kitchen. Now, every time the screen door slams, we all still think the same thing: it must be Tucker, going back to his cabin.''</p>
        <p>A. Tucker Cluett died after a brief illness last spring at age 65. A fastidious, sophisticated bachelor with loads of personal style, a smart address in Blue Hill, Me., and a taste for fine art and rare books, Tucker will be missed by all who knew him. But few people will mourn him as viscerally as his staff at Maclennan Lodge, which he owned here, among the towering spruce trees and shimmering poplars of remote New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>Tucker, who was free from pretension, threw all his energy into making the camp an enchanted place. But what really distinguished him from many other camp owners was that he wanted his staff to enjoy the same camp experience as the fanciest of his guests.</p>
        <p>Thus the lodge, in this largely impoverished, fiercely rural area, became Tucker's unlikely second home, complete with a family of five: the guides, Ollie Marshall and David and Shane Mann, who are brothers; and the cooks and housekeepers, Nancy Thomas and Anne Murray. The guides and Nancy had worked for Tucker since the year after he bought the lodge, in 1980.</p>
        <p>''He wasn't like our boss,'' David Mann said. ''He was more like a brother.''</p>
        <p>When Marshall suffered a detached retina a few years ago, Tucker drove him to Halifax, Nova Scotia, for surgery, and brought him home as well, a seven-hour drive each way. And when Shane Mann's infant son Blake had meningitis, requiring his father's presence at a hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick, 212 miles away, Shane was resigned to giving up his job. But Tucker wouldn't hear of it. Each Friday while Shane remained away, he hand-delivered Shane's paycheck to his wife, Kathy.</p>
        <p>The bond Tucker developed with his staff was deep, cemented with humor and crude practical jokes like filling Ollie's shoes with rocks, or setting off fireworks under the kitchen table. When Tucker set out smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres for the staff, he always made an odd number, because he enjoyed watching the guides fight over the last piece. No fools, the guides invariably found ways to turn the joke around.</p>
        <p>On Friday paydays the staff made a point of formality, driving Tucker to distraction by calling him by a name for which he had little use, Mr. Cluett. One Friday morning Tucker, feigning anger, tore up the staff's pay packets, and stomped out of the kitchen. He then watched through a back window as Nancy fished the checks out of the trash and, finding them blank, lit out after him.</p>
        <p>It all sounds a little silly, written down like this, but it worked, probably because Tucker, who had been a painfully shy, overweight child, got a reward he couldn't have anticipated when he bought the camp: he got to be a kid again, and this time without all the bad bits. And it worked because Tucker could truly be himself among the spirited, cheerful, unspoiled people on his staff.</p>
        <p>''Tucker fit in better here than we ever imagined,'' Nancy said. ''I think we brought out something in him that he could only express here.''</p>
        <p>The salmon took my fly on the last cast of what might very well have been my last trip to Maclennan Lodge. It leapt like a hurled knife, destroying the oppressive stillness as it fell back into the river with a resounding splash. Ollie moved fast now, firing up the motor, making for shore, as the powerful fish tore off line, heading downstream.</p>
        <p>Once again, time was moving, and fast. Far below, I saw a great, momentary gleam of silver in the river. It vanished, just as quickly as 20 years -- and a friend -- had passed.</p>
