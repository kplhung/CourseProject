        <p>GOOD and proper fenders, those curvaceous swells of metal flanking the bodies of vintage cars, began to fade away with Chrysler's Airflow of 1934. By the mid-50's, fenders were pretty thoroughly smoothed into cars' overall shapes. Now, with the Chrysler PT Cruiser, fenders are back. Can't the company make up its mind?</p>
        <p>The fenders are but one of many nostalgic notes played by the 2001 PT Cruiser, DaimlerChrysler's category-defying minivan-cum-sedan. Its overall shape owes much to the '37 Plymouth PT50 commercial sedan as well as to the Ford Fordor sedan of the late 30's -- with a 1950 Chevy Panel Van and a little Willys Overland in there somewhere -- though with the PT Cruiser these contours are drawn with a mighty small pen. Visually, the diminutive car comes close to being silly -- you rather expect clowns to tumble out, or Shriners -- but the aggressively posed front end, reminiscent of the hangdog look of classic street rods, saves the car from terminal cuteness.</p>

        <p>GOOD and proper fenders, those curvaceous swells of metal flanking the bodies of vintage cars, began to fade away with Chrysler's Airflow of 1934. By the mid-50's, fenders were pretty thoroughly smoothed into cars' overall shapes. Now, with the Chrysler PT Cruiser, fenders are back. Can't the company make up its mind?</p>
        <p>The fenders are but one of many nostalgic notes played by the 2001 PT Cruiser, DaimlerChrysler's category-defying minivan-cum-sedan. Its overall shape owes much to the '37 Plymouth PT50 commercial sedan as well as to the Ford Fordor sedan of the late 30's -- with a 1950 Chevy Panel Van and a little Willys Overland in there somewhere -- though with the PT Cruiser these contours are drawn with a mighty small pen. Visually, the diminutive car comes close to being silly -- you rather expect clowns to tumble out, or Shriners -- but the aggressively posed front end, reminiscent of the hangdog look of classic street rods, saves the car from terminal cuteness.</p>
        <p>Although the Cruiser is no longer hot news -- they've been in rental fleets for months -- it is indisputably the hot ride of the summer. Curious car lovers still swarm around the car like pesky mosquitoes.</p>
        <p>But novelty wears off and nostalgia is a shallow sentiment. The glow went off the New Beetle when, in the sober light of the showroom, shoppers began to see that it was limited by its flower-powered design, that the roofline offered wasted headroom up front but a neck-bending lack of it in back. In contrast, the PT Cruiser's charismatic retro design merely camouflages what is actually a supremely efficient box on wheels.</p>
        <p>Lift the yawning rear hatch lid and you see that the floor is flat, thanks to a low-profile beam-axle rear suspension. No shock-absorber towers intrude into the space.</p>
        <p>Even the Government can't decide what to make of the PT Cruiser. With its cargo-carrying versatility, it is a truck in the eyes of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which enforces fuel-economy standards and safety rules; the Environmental Protection Agency sees a car in there, and holds it to automobile pollution standards. The Cruiser -- PT stands for personal transportation -- demonstrates how out of date the government's taxonomies are in a market where some of the most popular new vehicles are neither car nor truck.</p>
        <p>The split rear bench seat, with three sets of belts, folds flat or can be pivoted upright and secured with straps to the middle window pillar. The seats can be unlatched from the floor and removed. (Since these units are heavy and awkward, a back brace should be among the options.) With the rear seats out and the front passenger seat folded down, the interior is cavernous, big enough to hold two or three mountain bikes, an eight-foot ladder or a downtown D.J.'s rave-ready turntable and loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>Even with the seats in place, but folded down, this van-in-drag offers loads of usable cargo space. The package shelf in back -- it can be used in several positions, and also doubles as a fold-out table for tailgate parties -- can be positioned to form a level surface from rear hatch to dashboard. If you run a catering service or flower shop, your next delivery van has arrived.</p>
        <p>For the driver, gaining access to the PT Cruiser is as easy as pulling up a chair at the dining-room table; the low step-in height (about mid-shin on me) and high lintels mean one doesn't lean or duck to get in -- as one must with, say, a Dodge Neon. The driver's seat is mounted high, rather like a lifeguard's chair, affording excellent legroom as well as the commanding seating position that would-be S.U.V. owners crave.</p>
        <p>The rear seat is some 8 inches higher than the one in front, so passengers back there can see ahead (a car-sickness-prevention measure that parents will appreciate along the Taconic Parkway). Still, the rear headroom is more than ample for the most ambitious beehive hairdos.</p>
        <p>The PT is only 168.8 inches long, nearly a foot shorter than the Ford Focus wagon, but offers 64 cubic feet of cargo space, beating the Ford by 8 cubic feet. The secret to this space efficiency -- and to the headroom, the great visibility, the easy access -- is the elevated roof. At 63 inches high, the PT is a half-foot taller than the Focus, which is itself quite upright.</p>
        <p>In another company's hands, such a tall, stubby package would look -- well, the word ''dorky'' comes to mind, along with the image of the Toyota Echo. But DaimlerChrysler has wisely concealed the PT's proportions with heart-grabbing retro touches.</p>
        <p>The fat fenders, the low and prominent bumpers, the lower-body contours that suggest running boards, all give the Cruiser a firm visual foundation that keeps it from looking tipsy, although the center of gravity is quite high by car standards. The government has conducted crash tests, but has not yet released the results.</p>
        <p>That foundation is more than skin deep. The PT Cruiser feels overbuilt, really sturdy for what could be considered, by some measures, a subcompact. The middle roof pillars are thick and the doors are wide and hefty. Under power, the PT's big-boned structure provides rattle-free composure and excellent isolation from even the shabbiest secondary roads. Contrary to popular belief, the Cruiser shares few mechanical parts with the Neon. Indeed, the Cruiser, which is built in Toluca, Mexico, has a surprising number of exclusive parts, along with a smattering of minivan bits.</p>
        <p>The sense of substance is underscored by the heavy steel door handles on the outside -- how many women will lose a nail on these old-fashioned push-button mechanisms? -- as well as the polished chrome door levers on the inside. The door gussets in the Limited Edition test car were rich suede over dense, sound-deadening panels. The sturdy rubber door pulls were textured to match the wrap on the four-spoke steering wheel.</p>
        <p>All this comfort and convenience comes with considerable mass. Tipping the scales at more than 3,200 pounds, the test car worked up a lather accelerating to interstate speeds. Under hard throttle, all the hard-won interior quiet melted in the face of engine howl. Powered by an in-line four cylinder of 2.4 liters (with 150 horsepower and peak torque of 162 foot-pounds at 4,000 r.p.m.), the PT won't tempt hot-rodders to feats of derring-don't. The test car was equipped with an automatic transmission, however, and the performance equation improves with the standard five-speed manual. Besides, the manual has a cue-ball shift knob; will that be enough to tempt Americans back to the pleasures of shifting gears?</p>
        <p>The car's handling suffers in the name of excellent ride quality. On the optional 16-inch Goodyear Eagle radials, the test car practically glided over the road, absorbing hits that would send other small cars skittering. But the handling, even with the ''touring'' suspension, seemed a little shifty. In the back-and-forth of spirited driving I found myself correcting the steering more than I'd like, to keep the PT in line.</p>
        <p>The driver's environment is functional and understated. The gauges are set in a shiny body-colored panel that mirrors the passenger's air bag cover. The audio and climate switches are off the DaimlerChrysler shelf. But why are front-window toggles high on the dash while the rear-window switches are toe-high in the back?</p>
        <p>On balance, complaints are few and compliments abound. This is a superb automobile at a terrific price ($16,500 before options). The glossy black test car had leather trim and side air bags, power driver's seat, chrome wheels, smoked rear glass and heated outside mirrors -- plus the expected air-conditioning, remote locking, traction control and antilock disc brakes -- in short, everything you can reasonably squeeze into a small car. It weighed in at $20,835.</p>
        <p>The PT Cruiser's free ride is coming to an end. There is wide discontent over long delivery delays -- a neighbor ordered hers in May and won't receive it until September -- and dealers who demand thousands of dollars over sticker price. That will end when the supply moves closer to the demand.</p>
        <p>But the essential goodness of the PT is likely to survive all assaults. Above all, it is efficient. There is no wasted sheet metal, no four-wheel-drive systems whirring away unnecessarily underneath. The retro look is a stopper, but the useful design is a keeper.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: Practical magic.</p>
