        <p>Chicago has a new luxury hotel, and it has designs on being something of an art gallery as well. The Park Hyatt Chicago opened last month in the new 67-story Park Tower at 800 North Michigan Avenue with 203 rooms and a number of works by well-known artists in  its public spaces.</p>
        <p>Gerhard Richter's painting ''Piazza del Duomo Milan'' (1968) is displayed in the lobby; ''Goddess'' (1982), a sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, is in the seventh-floor gallery, and a collection of Dale Chihuly glass sculptures is on display in the library.</p>

        <p>Chicago has a new luxury hotel, and it has designs on being something of an art gallery as well. The Park Hyatt Chicago opened last month in the new 67-story Park Tower at 800 North Michigan Avenue with 203 rooms and a number of works by well-known artists in  its public spaces.</p>
        <p>Gerhard Richter's painting ''Piazza del Duomo Milan'' (1968) is displayed in the lobby; ''Goddess'' (1982), a sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, is in the seventh-floor gallery, and a collection of Dale Chihuly glass sculptures is on display in the library.</p>
        <p>The contemporary guest rooms are decorated with black-and-white photographs of Chicago. The rooms have dataports and safes that hold and recharge laptops.</p>
        <p>The granite-floored bathrooms have a  walk-in shower with two shower heads, and an eight-inch flat-screen LCD television over the tub.</p>
        <p>NoMi, the hotel's French-Asian restaurant, on the seventh floor, offers views of Lake Michigan and the Magnificent Mile through the bay window or from a terrace seating 50. There is a health club with a 25-yard pool as well as a spa.</p>
        <p>Rates are $385 to $465 for doubles and $895 to $2,400 for the seven suites. For reservations, call (800) 233-1234, fax (312) 239-4000.</p>
