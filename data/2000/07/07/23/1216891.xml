        <p>What do a wrench, a fishing lure, a pepper mill and a couple of old license plates have in common? For Steve Gerberich, who is partial to hardware and kitchenware, they are the ingredients of the 30 or so of his whimsical sculptures. These works are on view through Oct. 22 at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Mass., in a show called ''Springs, Sprockets &amp; Pulleys: The Mechanical Sculptures of Steve Gerberich.''</p>
        <p>All it takes to send Mr. Gerberich's creations into motion is the push of a button or the crank of a wheel. Among his works is ''The Gerberich Grand Orchestra.'' Its members, who move about to jazz accompaniment, include a gyrating saxophonist with a teapot head, and a drummer playing hubcap cymbals and two metal buckets as drums. At the 25-foot-long work ''George and the Sea Creatures,'' turning a crank will cause a fisherman to cast a lure, one fish to snap for it, another to wag its tail, brooms to sway and a blinking vacuum cleaner to scavenge the ''sea floor.''</p>

        <p>''I've always been more interested in the fishing tackle -- a visual, man-made form of trickery -- than in catching any fish,'' Mr. Gerberich said.</p>
        <p>The Berkshire Museum, 39 South Street, is open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Closed Monday in September and October. Admission is $6; (413) 443-7171; www.berkshiremuseum.org.</p>
