        <p>Monaco Grand Prix</p>
        <p>Q. For our anniversary next May, my husband and I would like to attend the Grand Prix of Monaco automobile race. Could you tell me when the race is and provide other details? -- L. L., Avon, Conn.</p>
        <p>A. The 59th Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco, part of the international Formula One racing series, is set for May 24 to 27, 2001. The race itself, run through the streets of the principality on the Riviera, will be May 27. Practice sessions for the Formula One cars are May 24 and 26.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere at Monaco is unlike that at any other Formula One event. The circuit twists and climbs through the principality, which is half the size of Central Park, with the howl of racing engines reverberating off towering condos and Belle-Epoque hotels.</p>
        <p>To order tickets, contact the Comite d'Organisation, Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco, Boite Postale 464, 98012 Monaco Cedex, or call the Automobile Club of Monaco at (377) 93.15.26.00. The fax is (377) 93.25.80.08; www.acm.mc.</p>
        <p>The best viewing areas are the grandstands at the Ste.-Devote turn, the narrow corner immediately after the start. The grandstands near the casino and the Albert I public swimming pool are also good.</p>
        <p>Although ticket prices have not been determined for 2001, you can expect them to be slightly higher than this year's prices. These ranged from $114 to $314 (at 7 francs to $1) for seats in the grandstands for Sunday's main event, and $57 to $157 for the Saturday practice session, during which the drivers compete to see who can run the fastest lap and thus earn the starting berth at the front of the lineup for the Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>If you're willing to watch standing up, you can buy a general admission ticket. And the general-admission area just below the palace, called Rocher de Monaco-Ville, can be particularly tricky, since it is a steep, slippery hillside. Tickets in the Rocher were $36 on race day this year; in the other two general-admission areas, they were $57 to $114.</p>
        <p>Finding a parking spot is about as difficult an event as the grand prix itself. The train line that runs along the Cote d'Azur -- Nice is a particularly good place to look for a hotel room on race weekend -- is the most sensible way to get to the race.</p>
        <p>A tour operator can streamline the planning of your trip. Grand Prix Tours, 1071 Camelback Street, Newport Beach, Calif. 92660; (949) 717-3333, fax (949) 717-3344, conducts tours to several Formula One races. Among its Monaco packages this year was one that included five nights at the Grand Hotel, which overlooks the slowest turn on the track. Guests can stand on the roof and watch the race. The package also included a cocktail party at which tour participants could talk to one of the Grand Prix drivers, daily breakfast, a race-preview party and airport transfers. The prices this year started from $3,950 a person, based on double occupancy. Air fare is extra. A two-night package at the Novotel or Sofitel in Nice was $595 a person, double occupancy. This did  not include air fare or race tickets. Next year's prices have not been set.</p>
        <p>A Montreal company, Formula Tours, (888) 367-6851, also operates tours to the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>Apartments in Sydney</p>
        <p>Q. I'd like to go to Australia for several months over Christmas and rent a small apartment in Sydney to use as a base for tours. Do you know of any companies that can arrange this for me? -- Charlotte F. Zartman, Sun City West, Ariz.</p>
        <p>A. Manly Seaside Holiday Apartments, Shop 2/39 East Esplanade, Manly NSW 2095, telephone (61-2) 9977 5213, fax (61-2) 9977 7062, has 137 apartments in 37 buildings in Manly, a beachfront suburb of Sydney. They are available for as little as three nights, and range in size from a studio to three bedrooms, either in town or along the beach.</p>
        <p>The apartments are cleaned each week and come with linen, towels, television, telephone, kitchen facilities and, in most cases, parking. The cost per week from Dec. 16 to Feb. 4 ranges from $642 to $993, at $1.71 Australian to $1. For listings, call up www.manly-seaside.com.</p>
        <p>L. J. Hooker, telephone (61-2) 9283 5511, fax (61-2) 9283 5030, has apartments ranging from $700 to $1,460 a week during this period. Call up www.ljhooker.com.</p>
        <p>If you rent an apartment through a real estate agent, prices will be considerably lower, perhaps half as much. But it is likely that you will have to rent for a minimum of three months and sign a lease, as well as provide four weeks' rent as security and the first four weeks' rent in advance, as well as arrange your own utility service.
