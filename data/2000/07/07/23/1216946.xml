        <p>WITH its double-height windows, two-story-high entrance lobby, clock tower and landscaped parking lot, the white concrete building at the corner of Route 110 and Executive Boulevard could pass for an office building if not for three loading docks at the front and a sign that reads, ''Self-Storage Made Easy.''</p>
        <p>The 128,000-square-foot building, which opened in February, is the eighth self-storage center and the first on Long Island to be developed by Arredondo &amp; Company of Stamford, Conn., under the name Westy Storage Centers.

        <p>WITH its double-height windows, two-story-high entrance lobby, clock tower and landscaped parking lot, the white concrete building at the corner of Route 110 and Executive Boulevard could pass for an office building if not for three loading docks at the front and a sign that reads, ''Self-Storage Made Easy.''</p>
        <p>The 128,000-square-foot building, which opened in February, is the eighth self-storage center and the first on Long Island to be developed by Arredondo &amp; Company of Stamford, Conn., under the name Westy Storage Centers. The developer is also building a 194,000-square-foot center on Marcus Avenue in Lake Success, to open in February. Arredondo's other centers are in Westchester and in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The Farmingdale building not only joins a rapidly growing number of self-storage centers on Long Island -- 40 are in various stages of development, according to the New York Self Storage Association, an industry group in Albany -- but also represents the new direction the industry. It is moving from what basically were metal or cinder-block buildings with garage doors toward an environment with more amenities intended to make storage as stress-free and comfortable as possible.</p>
        <p>''What we are seeing are very sophisticated dwellings for self-storage going up that offer a lot of high-tech amenities, with individual door alarms, electronic surveillance and more and more detail being put into comfort, with carpeted hallways and lounges,'' said Michael R. Kidd, executive director of the Self Storage Association in Springfield, Va., a national industry group.  ''Very often these buildings are indistinguishable from office buildings.''</p>
        <p>Most of the new centers provide heating and air-conditioning along with humidity control to keep valuables protected from mildew. And instead of being hidden away in an industrial backwater, the centers are being built on major highways to make customers feel more secure when they come in during the evening or on weekends.</p>
        <p>Some centers are adding business centers with telephones and modem access so that customers can plug in their laptop computers and conduct their business on site. Some are even installing recreational areas and play areas for children, Mr. Kidd said.</p>
        <p>The growing number of entrepreneurs who sell products as well as services from a home office has added to the demand for storage space, Mr. Kidd said, noting that membership in his association has jumped to 2,200 from 1,600 in three years.</p>
        <p>''Anyone currently looking for office or retail space in major metropolitan areas usually walks away with a sound case of sticker shock,'' Mr. Kidd said. ''An option is to look at self-storage to handle inventory.''</p>
        <p>He told of a Richmond, Va., woman who recently bought 100,000 pieces of software over the Internet for resale not realizing the amount of space she would need until a semitrailer pulled up in front of her house.  Mr. Kidd found her a self-storage building with a vacancy -- not an easy task because the summer months, when students on vacation store belongings, are traditionally a  high-occupancy time..</p>
        <p>The strong housing market has also contributed to demand, he said. ''Relocation activity and change of residence, divorce and any of these life changes come with a need to put possessions someplace,'' Mr. Kidd said. People storing personal possessions are still the largest category of customers, he added, but businesses needing cheaper space to store files are adding to the industry's growth.</p>
        <p>Caesar A. Arredondo, the president of Arredondo &amp; Company, said that since the woman of the house usually starts ''cleaning out the garage or other areas of the house and putting the extra stuff into storage,'' he designed his centers with women in mind.</p>
        <p>Their primary concern is security, he said, so he puts his buildings in areas where women can feel safe at all times. His Port Chester, N.Y., center, for example, is across the street from a police station.</p>
        <p>Heavy landscaping, music in the lobby and brightly lighted and windowed corridors are other features. At least three people are on duty when the centers are open and television cameras monitor interiors and exteriors. Identity cards to operate electronic gates record who enters and  leaves.</p>
        <p>Almost half the 1,043 storage units in Farmingdale, which range from 25 to 450 square feet, have been leased since the building opened in February. A 5-foot-by-5-foot unit rents for $69 a month. One measuring 10 feet by 20 feet -- enough, Mr. Arredondo said, to hold the contents of a three-bedroom house -- rents for $325 a month.  Leases are on a month-to-month basis, but customers are guaranteed that their rent will not be raised for two years.</p>
        <p>Beverlyann Brown, a divorced mother of two teenagers who sold her four-bedroom colonial-style house in Amityville four months ago, faced a predicament common in today's strong housing market.</p>
        <p>I THOUGHT it would take me at least a year to sell the house,'' said Mrs. Brown, a New York City schoolteacher. ''But it sold in two months.''</p>
        <p>While waiting for a new house to be built in Amityville, she and the children moved in with her parents, meanwhile fitting seven rooms of furniture, including her refrigerator, and most of their clothes, into a 10-foot-by-15-foot storage unit at the Farmingdale building, for which she pays $400 a month in rent.</p>
        <p>Peter Breihof and his wife, Michele, who are both pharmaceutical representatives, also rent space in Farmingdale, using their separate units to store their samples. ''I rent an apartment in a private house, so I don't want to keep my samples there,'' Mr. Breihof said. ''I would guess that 75 percent of pharmaceutical representatives use self-storage to conduct their businesses.'' In his case, he rents a 6-foot-by-10-foot space in the Farmingdale building, paying $105 a month for it.</p>
        <p>Michael Tully, who rebuilds jukeboxes, operates his business out of a 10-foot-by-10-foot space at another center, Freeport Self  Storage, a 570-unit facility owned and operated by Paul J. Kampa. ''I'd have to pay at least $1,500 a month for regular warehouse space,'' Mr. Tully said, noting that he pays $400 a month for his self-storage unit.</p>
        <p>Public Storage of Glendale, Calif., a publicly held company that owns 80 million square feet of self-storage space nationwide, has 14 locations in Nassau and Suffolk and will open three more before the end of the year, said the company's president, Harvey Lenkin. The new locations are in Syosset, Farmingdale and Port Washington.</p>
        <p>''Long Island is one of the better markets in the country because of the growing population and the rising level of awareness about our industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company will offer self-storage pickup and delivery at the new Farmingdale building. Customers can load belongings into a 7-foot-by-5-foot wooden container delivered to their residence, which is then picked up by flatbed truck and delivered to the storage building. The container can then be delivered to another location when the customer is ready for it.</p>
        <p>Kalikow Development of Westbury, a residential and retail developer, has also entered the market. In a joint venture with Shurgard Storage Centers of Seattle, a publicly traded company, Kalikow retrofitted a 75,000-square-foot industrial building in Melville last year to create 681 storage units. It is currently 88 percent leased, said Edward Kalikow, the company's president.</p>
        <p>''The Long Island market has been underserved for a very long period of time and I am looking into several more opportunities,'' he said. ''To me, a business that can charge from $20 to $30 a square foot for space and not have a high operational cost is very appealing.''</p>
        <p>Rates at the Melville building are $105 a month for a 5-foot-by-10-foot unit and $185 a month for one measuring 10 feet by 10 feet. Units with air conditioning and heat have a $20 a month surcharge.</p>
        <p>Theodore J. Stratigos and Kenneth W. Bauer, both brokers with Cushman &amp; Wakefield of Long Island, a commercial brokerage based in Melville, converted a 90,000-square-foot industrial building in Syosset to Syosset Self Storage about three years ago.  The 473 units there are fully leased, Mr. Stratigos said.</p>
        <p>Now he and another partner, Robert Rosen of Montauk, are building an 80,000-square-foot facility in Bayport to be called Community Self Storage. The building, which will have 665 storage units ranging  from 25 to 250 square feet, is scheduled to open in September. A 5-foot-by-5-foot unit will rent for $60 a month, while a 10-foot-by-10-foot one will cost $125.</p>
        <p>''Although it takes much less time to convert an existing industrial building, new construction gives us the flexibility of building to meet the needs of today's customers with full climate control and a better lighting pattern,'' Mr. Stratigos said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kampa, who converted an industrial building into the Freeport Self Storage center two years ago, recently added 100 storage units to the building and is planning 80 more, to bring the total to 650 units. Even with the recent addition, he is 85 percent rented, Mr. Kampa said, adding, ''There is still room for expansion on Long Island and I have a couple of other sites I am looking at.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stratigos expressed reservations about the industry's rapid growth in the region. ''These facilities are being built everywhere you look,'' he said. ''Although we are evaluating other sites, we are being very cautious and selective.''</p>
