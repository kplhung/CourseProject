        <p>HELLO, Turkey; let's go eat a lobster.'' With these words Evelyn Fay, a trustee of the Katonah Museum of Art here, greeted Volney (Turkey) Righter, a fellow trustee who was the guest of honor at a clambake and exhibition opening held recently at the museum.</p>

        <p>HELLO, Turkey; let's go eat a lobster.'' With these words Evelyn Fay, a trustee of the Katonah Museum of Art here, greeted Volney (Turkey) Righter, a fellow trustee who was the guest of honor at a clambake and exhibition opening held recently at the museum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Righter, who inherited his father's prep school nickname years ago, is 97, with all the memories that such a life span brings. Many of those memories involve his wife, Sally, who was twice president of the museum.</p>
        <p>After her death in 1998 at the age of 89, Mr. Righter began raising money for the museum in her name; by last year, he had collected $213,000. And he was not happy.</p>
        <p>As he recalled: ''Last winter, on vacation in Cuernevaca, Mexico, I said to the family: 'This fund is stalled. It should be at $500,000. Sally was a perfectionist. If she were around, she'd want it completed.' So we all agreed to give $300,000 to clean it up.''</p>
        <p>The clambake, with its one-and-a-half-pound lobsters and buckets of steamers, was held in the museum's courtyard to commemorate not only the fact that the Sarah W. Righter fund had reached its goal but also the opening of the first exhibition sponsored by the fund, ''Maine and the Modern Spirit.'' The show, which runs through Sept. 24, features works spanning the 20th century by artists who were born in Maine or lived there. Mrs. Righter was passionate about modern American art, and her spirit suffuses the show, Susan Edwards, the museum's executive director, said.</p>
        <p>In the show's catalog, Susan Larsen, the  guest curator, writes: ''The wildness of Maine generates a strong sense of 'presentness,' of living in the moment and feeling deeply alive.''</p>
        <p>It would not be a stretch to say that this is how Mr. Righter seems to live. Although he is low key -- tall and slender in the Fred Astaire mode -- he seems to enjoy his surroundings with gusto. Early in the evening, he sat at a small table in the twilight, eating oysters on the half shell. He also showed off his shirt, a red flannel embroidered in white, which he had bought in Mexico a few years ago. And he complained jokingly about taking his wife's place on the board of trustees and attending regular meetings on the museum's second floor. ''I walk up those terrible 10 steps to prove I'm a man.''</p>
        <p>The dinner itself struck the same deliberately informal note. After guests got their food, they sat at tables decorated with miniature lighthouses, votive candles and vases holding sand and shells. Dessert was a blueberry cobbler homemade by Haley Fay, who works in the museum's development office.</p>
        <p>After the meal, Mr. Righter stood at a podium and spoke of his wife and her love for modern art, and introduced friends, among them George (Spike) Beitzel and his wife, Marylou, also major benefactors at the museum. He introduced a son, James, an architect from Boston, and a grandson, Mark, a furniture designer from Manhattan, and a granddaughter, Eliot Righter Ramos, and three grandchildren, Clyde, 12, Theresa, 10, and Satchel, 8.</p>
        <p>James Righter reminisced about growing up in Bedford, with a mother immersed in ''modern art with a capital M.''</p>
        <p>''It was very influential to me as an architect,'' he said. ''I remember spending a lot of time at the Museum of Modern Art with Mum. The painter John Marin was for many people a beginning point for their interest in modern art. I had a John Marin in my bedroom -- a reproduction, that is. And so this is a very poignant show for me; there is so much of the kind of art Mum loved.''</p>
        <p>It is something of a landmark for the museum, too, Athena Kimball said. Ms. Kimball is co-chairwoman of the museum's endowment campaign. Donald Herdrich is the co-chairman. The goal is a $5 million endowment, which will generate approximately $250,000 a year ''so we have a steady income,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''We have income now, but it's unpredictable because government funding is so unpredictable,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So far, the museum has $3.6 million toward the endowment; the $500,000 Sally Righter Fund is part of that figure.</p>
        <p>As museum officials looked to the future,  Mr. Righter shared a memory of the past, saying: ''I met Sally when we both had time off from our companies and headed to Hot Springs, Va., for a vacation. I was invited to a large dinner party where I saw a girl I knew. After dinner we got into a conversation and she said, 'Come meet my roommate.' I went to their bedroom. Sally was reading a book in bed. I took one look and said, 'That's for me.' I didn't even know what was under the covers, if she were tall or short or what. Three months later we were engaged. Six months later we were married.''</p>
