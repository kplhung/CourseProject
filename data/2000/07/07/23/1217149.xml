        <p>WHEN the late afternoon sun turns the crenellated limestone walls of the Old City to warm glowing gold, it is easy to understand the intense emotional hold of this tiny place.</p>
        <p>Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Sultan, built these walls in 1538 -- rebuilt them, really, from the stones left behind by Romans, Jews, Muslims, Byzantines, Crusaders, the Arab armies of Saladin and the Mamelukes. They are walls that enclose sites holy to the three great monotheistic religions.</p>
        <p>That well-known fact places Jerusalem at the very heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue so difficult, so sensitive, that until now peace negotiators simply put it off. The city, and the idea of it as a capital, is a central icon to both sides. Jews, after centuries of  dispersion and persecution, still end their Seder each Passover: ''Next year in Jerusalem.'' And in virtually every Muslim home in every Palestinian refugee camp there hangs a picture of the Dome of the Rock.</p>
        <p>But now the negotiating teams at Camp David are trying to come to grips with Jerusalem, and they are finding it an extraordinarily difficult task -- to imagine the unimaginable, a truly united (or fairly divided) Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>It may be tempting to think that the easiest basis for a settlement would be to admit that the two sides share a heritage and guarantee all groups access to the holy sites. But in 50 years of conflict -- and more than 20 years of peacemaking -- achieving that kind of formula in Jerusalem has only become harder. That is because new layers of grievance, resentment and reason for distrust have been added on both sides. And in many Israeli and Palestinian minds, these only reinforce the idea that their one best guarantee of access and security  is sole political control of all or part of the city.</p>
        <p>For Jews, the holy place is the Western (or Wailing) Wall, the remains of the Second Temple built on Mount Moriah after the return from exile in Babylon. For Muslims, it is the plateau on the Temple Mount above the wall, known as the Haram al-Sharif, or noble sanctuary, from which the prophet Muhammad made a visit to heaven on his winged horse. The sanctuary contains the Dome of the Rock shrine and Al Aksa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. It is exactly the same place, and both Jews and Muslims share the belief that the rock itself is where Abraham prepared his son for sacrifice. For Christians, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a short distance away, is where Jesus was crucified, buried and resurrected to redeem mankind's sins.</p>
        <p>Jerusalem and its holy sites were deemed so unique that, under the doomed 1947 United Nations partition plan for turning the British Palestine mandate into Arab and Jewish zones, the city was to become an international district. It was an idea acceptable then to David Ben-Gurion and his overwhelmingly secular Zionist associates, who had more regard for security considerations than for controlling religious shrines.</p>
        <p>But the Arab armies attacked instead, and Israel as born in a bitter war. Israeli troops fought their way desperately up the twisting road through the hills to relieve Jews besieged with little food or water in the new city that had grown up outside the Ottoman walls. The rusted hulks of their makeshift armored cars still line the road as monuments. But the Jordanian King Abdullah's Arab Legion, trained and led by British officers, held the heights above Jerusalem, captured the Old City and incorporated it into Jordan.</p>
        <p>From 1948 to 1967, Jerusalem was a divided city -- half Jordanian, half Israeli -- with limited passage allowed through the Mandelbaum Gate, mostly for international officials and Christian clergy. Most important for the future, the Old City was sealed off to Jews and many of their religious sites were defiled. Then, in the 1967 war, Israel took all of Jerusalem and the West Bank, its triumphant army chaplain, Shlomo Goren (later to become a chief rabbi of Israel) blowing his ram's horn at the Western Wall.</p>
        <p>Over the next 30 years, Israelis created their own facts on the ground, building settlements in the West Bank, expanding Jewish neighborhoods into East Jerusalem and neglecting services to the Arab areas. Even since the Oslo accords, Israelis have continued to build Jewish housing in Arab neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>All of this has made decisions on how to treat Jerusalem in a peace settlement extraordinarily difficult.</p>
        <p>Dr. Khalil Shikaki, a Palestinian academic who has advised the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, said last week that ''the Palestinian public will not tolerate less than full sovereignty over all of East Jerusalem, including the Haram al-Sharif. Palestinians will not tolerate Israeli border police or Israeli checkpoints. That is not sovereignty, that is not control. Palestinians no longer want to ask Israelis for permission to build their homes, to educate their children, to live their lives.''</p>
        <p>But, at the same time, he said that if they were persuaded that the Israeli approach was genuine, ''the Palestinian street would certainly be flexible.''</p>
        <p>MOSHE AMIRAV knows this city well. As a young paratrooper who had already been wounded in the 1967 war, he climbed out of a hospital window to rejoin his unit when he heard it was trying to retake the Old City. He entered politics with the hard-right Likud youth movement, served on the City Council and worked under the famous Mayor Teddy Kollek on roads, planning and other municipal matters. His political views  moved toward the left years ago, and he is now one of a handful of Israelis who have been trying to find solutions for Jerusalem, meeting frequently with the local Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini, whose forebear died commanding the Arab force trying to block the road to Jerusalem in 1948.</p>
        <p>''Jerusalem is a two-fold problem,'' Mr. Amirav said. ''The emotional and psychological problem and the very practical problem.''</p>
        <p>The Old City, he noted, is a mere one square kilometer in a city that now measures 120 square kilometers. (In 1967, West Jerusalem, the modern Jewish part of the city, was 37 square kilometers, and Jordanian East Jerusalem was 7.) And, he said: ''Jerusalem is not a united city. It is a divided city, one of the most divided in the world. More divided than Belfast.''</p>
        <p>''In the euphoria of 1967, we annexed 28 Arab villages that later on became Arab neighborhoods,'' he said. ''Our aim was to enlarge the Jewish population, but we did all the most stupid possible things.''</p>
        <p>One possible solution, said Dr. Amirav, who teaches conflict resolution at Hebrew University, is redrawing the boundaries of the city to ''enlarge the pie'' and devising ways to share power. As for the sensitive religious sites, he says Israelis need to be reminded that since 1967 the Temple Mount has been under the control of the Waqf, the Islamic charity directed by the Mufti of Jerusalem, a decision made by the Israeli military hero and former defense minister, Moshe Dayan.</p>
        <p>Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, may well be thinking along similar lines. Last week, he called Reuvan Merhav, a former Foreign Ministry official and member of the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, to join him at Camp David. The research institute had prepared a report, bristling with complicated maps, showing various options for enlarging Jerusalem by adding several large Jewish settlements, including Ma'aleh Adumin in the West Bank, to the municipality while at the same time giving a kind of ''functional sovereignty'' to Palestinian areas.</p>
        <p>One proposal on the table is literally building a bridge between the village of Abu Dis, where there is already an imposing new building believed destined to be the Palestinian Parliament, and the Haram al-Sharif.  Thus, Muslims, including Mr. Arafat, would be able to go directly to their holy sites without having to pass through Israeli territory or encounter Israeli police.</p>
        <p>Abu Dis, still a dusty little place, already partly inside municipal borders, is on the Mount of Olives, directly overlooking the Dome of the Rock.</p>
        <p>LAST week, as the leaders met at Camp David, Israelis clogged the phone lines to call-in shows with their own suggestions for how to resolve Jerusalem's status. Much of the talk was pragmatic. And yet, the fact of deep distrust and political resistance remains. Mr. Arafat has declared that ''the Arab leader has not been born who is willing to forfeit the rights of Muslims in Jerusalem,'' and has reportedly told President Clinton he fears assassination if he is seen giving up the goal of Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, whose own mentor, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, was gunned down for his peace efforts by an ultra religious Israeli, saw his uneasy coalition government implode even as he departed for Camp David. He was told last week of a newspaper poll back home that reported that 70 percent of all Israelis believe that Israel must not concede any part of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians in any peace agreement.</p>
        <p>Natan Sharansky, who took his Russian immigrant party out of Mr. Barak's coalition, has declared that ''Jerusalem is the very soul which unites and fortifies the nation in its entirety.'' And two former chief rabbis took out a newspaper ad to proclaim, ''Whoever, God forbid, will lift his hand against the land of Israel and Jerusalem and the Temple Mount will be written in shame and disgrace for all generations to come.''</p>
        <p>The way to solve the problem, suggested Prof. Rami Friedman, the director of the Jerusalem Institute, who worked on the options study, is perhaps not to solve it; that is, not to be too specific, for each side has too much to lose. For the holy sites, he suggested, perhaps it is best to muddle along. ''It sounds crazy conceptually,'' he added, ''but it's very practical.</p>
        <p>''There is so much history, so much religion, so much nationalism embedded in that one square kilometer,'' he said, ''that any solution will create more conflict than you had already.''</p>
