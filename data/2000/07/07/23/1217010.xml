        <p>THE Nasdaq seems to have gotten beyond its valuation problem, sort of. Earnings from most technology companies remain strong. And the market for initial public offerings, many of them technology issues, is showing signs of cranking up again after a sharp slowdown this spring.</p>
        <p>A total of 104 new issues were priced in the second quarter, according to Thompson Financial Securities Data. That was down from 141 in the first quarter and 166 in the fourth quarter of 1999.</p>
        <p>But the figures are relative: In the first quarter of 1999, when the stock market was booming, only 73 new issues were priced.</p>
        <p>And there is a lot in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>IPOfinancial.com, publisher of a twice-a-month newsletter, is tracking more than 300 companies that are waiting to come to market. More than two-thirds of those got in line before May 1 and are awaiting improved conditions.</p>
        <p>Gail Bronson, a senior analyst for IPO Monitor, a research firm, and a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, took some time last week to talk about the new-issue market. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. The stock market appears to have stabilized, and the deal flow has picked up a bit over the last few weeks. Is the new issue market ready to fly again?</p>
        <p>A.  It seems like we have washed a lot of the speculative nature out of the market, but there is a long list of issues that have been pulled, and those issues haven't come back. We are in the summer doldrums. I suspect there are many significant I.P.O.'s related to the Internet and telecommunications that are holding back to the fall in anticipation of a more robust market. Those companies that have been in registration that have postponed their deals or cut back on their size are smart. You want to come out in the most stable Wall Street environment that you can. How your stock does when it goes public colors a company's capability for the following six months to a year.</p>
        <p>Q. Did the meltdown in the Nasdaq make investors more selective about new issues?</p>
        <p>A.  In the past couple of years, we have seen companies go out and be very successful as story stocks, companies with some revenues but no real prospects for earnings in the near term. You are not going to see as many of them. In order to garner strong interest in the public market, companies that go public over the next few quarters will be able to promote the fact that they will have earnings in the near term.</p>
        <p>Q. The drop-off in initial public offerings has been sharp, but the decline in secondary sales of stock has been even more pronounced. Are some companies not going to be able to tap the market?</p>
        <p>A.  I am not aware of anyone giving up on a secondary offering. But you will see a lot of consolidation, with companies that are in vertical spaces buddying up. There is just not enough consumer support to sustain all of them. And this is healthy, because only the strongest survive . . .</p>
        <p>Now is a great opportunity for companies to just buy.</p>
        <p>Q. A lot of the Internet mania seems to have evaporated. Does that reflect changing attitudes about the commercial potential of the World Wide Web?</p>
        <p>A.  Marketing on the Net will always be a wonderful tool, but it is doubtful it will supplant or cut into sales traffic. At the end of the day, companies will discover that the Internet is a good way to cut the cost of doing business as opposed to augmenting revenues. That is why it is a very exciting time to be part of the infrastructure build-out for the Internet and related platforms. There is all sorts of activity in what is now the second chapter of building the next level of Internet infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Q. Aside from infrastructure companies, what sorts of companies will likely be well received by investors in coming months?</p>
        <p>A.  Biotechnology is very much coming into its own now. Companies have been doing research to the point where they now have something to sell in the marketplace. This is different from the biotech wave in the early 1990's, when there was a ground swell of enthusiasm that faded because there were no real products. Now we have companies with real products that are based on biotechnological innovations. And those companies will probably come to market.</p>
        <p>Q. Last year, tons of money was invested by venture capitalists. Have those flows slowed?</p>
        <p>A.  There doesn't seem to be any less interest in investing money privately to help build out this second wave of infrastructure, much less vertical market companies. Everyone continues to be very enthusiastic about the potential. When that potential is realized in terms of companies producing net profit remains to be seen. And the I.P.O. event is simply the last step in the venture capital cycle.</p>
