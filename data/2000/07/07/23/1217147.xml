        <p>It's an old strategy to save your Sunday punch for the most dangerous opponent, but Alexei Shirov had uneven results with that strategy in the Grandmasters Tournament in Merida, Mexico, June 13 to June 19.</p>
        <p>In the first round, when Gilberto Hernandez of Mexico confronted him with the French Defense, Shirov played innocuously against it, concealing his real weapon for Vladimir Akopian of Armenia, his last-round opponent. But Hernandez beat him, and he had a furious fight on his hands with his supposed superweapon against Akopian.</p>
        <p>All ended well, however. His defeat of Akopian gave him a 4-2 score, ahead of Judit Polgar with 3 1/2-2 1/2, Hernandez with 2 1/2-3 1/2 and Akopian with 2-4.</p>
        <p>Anticipating Akopian's 5 . . . Ba5, Shirov played the most aggressive sequence, 6 b4 cd 7 Qg4.</p>
        <p>The gambit with 6 b4 is best left alone. After 6 . . . cb? 7 Nb5 Nc6 8 ab Bb4 9 c3 Be7 10 Bd3 a6 11 Qg4 Kf8 12 Ba3, the white attack more than compensates for Black's extra pawn.</p>
        <p>In Anand-Lputian in Wijk-aan-Zee in January, White played 7 Nb5 Bc7 8 f4 Bd7 9 Nc7 Qc7 10 Nf3 a6 11 a4 Ne7 12 Bd3 Nf5 13 O-O Nc6 14 Qe1 Qb6 15 Rb1 Nce7 16 b5 ab 17 ab Ne3 18 Rf2 Nc4 19 h3 Nf5! 20 Re2 h5! 21 Qf2 Ra4 22 Re1 g6 23 Bf5 e5! 24 Nd4 O-O!, but Black had an even game.</p>
        <p>The gambit that Botvinnik popularized with 7 . . . Ne7 is forced in this version, because 7 . . . g6 turns the black kingside into Swiss cheese.</p>
        <p>After 16 Qf7, the complications have made Black the gambiteer. Botvinnik's point was that the black position was solid and it was difficult for White to obtain the initiative. That verdict  stands today, but White goes on trying.</p>
        <p>Akopian's sacrifice of rook for knight with 17 . . . Rf3 18 gf Ne5 19 Be2 further disheveled the white formation. It was in keeping with Botvinnik's conception of how Black must contest the game.</p>
        <p>After 26 Qh4, Akopian might have considered 26 . . . d3!? but could not find a way out of 27 Rd5! ed 28 Rd3 Qc1 29 Kg2 Qc2 30 Qh7! Ke8 31 Qh5 Rg6 (or 31 . . . Kd7 32 Rd5!) 32 Re3 d4 33 Re2 Qb1 34 Qh8 Kd7 35 Qd4 Ke8 36 Qc3, which gives Shirov good winning chances in light of the exposed black king.</p>
        <p>After 26 . . . Qa4?, Shirov struck with 27 Re6! If 27 . . . Ke6, then 28 Re1 Kd7 29 Qe7 Kc6 30 Qd6 Kb5 31 Rb1 Ka5 32 Qd5 b5 33 Qg8.</p>
        <p>After 27 . . . Rg3 28 hg Nf5 29 Qh7 Ke6 30 Qg6, it would not have been an improvement for Akopian to play 30  . . . Ke5, because 31 Re1 Be4 32 f4 Kd5 33 Qf7 Kc5 34 Re4 is hopeless for him.</p>
        <p>After 40 . . . Qh1, Shirov took all the fight out of the defense by simplifying with 41 Rd5! Qd5 42 Qc3.</p>
        <p>If 42 . . . Kb6, then 43 f6 Qf5 44 Ke3 Kb7 45 Qd4 Kc8 46 Qa7 Qe6 47 Kd2 Qf6 48 Qc5 Kd8 49 Qb5 yields an easily won queen-and-pawn ending.</p>
        <p>But 42 . . . Kd6 made things all the easier for Shirov; 43 Qd3 forced a winning king-and-pawn ending.</p>
        <p>After 47 Kc1, there was nothing more for Akopian to do but give up. Thus, 47 . . . Kd6 48 g4 Ke5 49 Kb2 Kf6 50 c4 wins easily for Shirov.</p>
