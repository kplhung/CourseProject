        <p>THE SETTING -- The ballroom of the Lincoln Square Synagogue, at  Amsterdam Avenue and West 69th Street, last Wednesday.

        <p>THE SETTING -- The ballroom of the Lincoln Square Synagogue, at  Amsterdam Avenue and West 69th Street, last Wednesday. Nearly 500 people, including latecomers stuffing the hallways, witnessed Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, author of ''Kosher Sex,''  and Richard Bey, a talk show host on WABC radio, debate Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider, co-authors of ''The Rules,'' a 1995 dating guide.  Judith Regan, the publisher and editor, moderated as the panel tackled the question, ''Should women play hard to get?''</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Women in sweater sets and men in yarmulkes roared as Rabbi Boteach, whose 1999 book is a Talmud-inspired guide to keeping passion aflame, read part of an e-mail he received from a single woman: ''I have decided that it is harder to believe in the perfect man than it is to believe in God.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schneider, one of whose rules is to stash an egg timer by your bed to keep phone conversations with men to a minimum, said, ''You have to create the perfect man.'' She added, ''We're not happy that we have to do this, but it's like a diet. Ellen and I are trying to be pragmatic.'</p>
        <p>Mr. Bey shook his head in disgust. ''Are there women who will respect a man they can manipulate? If you think you can create love, intimacy and spontaneity by following a set of rules, I feel very sorry for you.''</p>
        <p>Applause all around.</p>
        <p>Among the topics: Do shy men exist? ''Of course!'' the rabbi said. ''There are no shy men,'' Ms. Schneider said.</p>
        <p>How can you play hard to get and join a dating service? ''Explain that one to me!'' Mr. Bey said.</p>
        <p>Tania Tulcan, 38, a Manhattan lawyer, came on a lark. ''They really don't give enough credence to friendship or love,'' she said, nodding toward Ms. Fein and Ms. Schneider. ''But I don't think an Orthodox rabbi is an adequate spokesman for this, either. What does he know about how regular women feel? He grew up in a completely different environment.''</p>
        <p>Juli Nadler, a publicist in her 30's, said: ''For me, the rules are not about being manipulative or playing games. They're about empowering women.''</p>
        <p>During the question period, one man wondered if there was a prayer he could say to enhance his dating prospects. Everyone laughed.</p>
        <p>Dave Weintraub, 28, an educator, asked audience members to listen and not attack one another. He said of the rules, ''This is New York shallowness personified.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the evening fans swarmed the panel, handing dog-eared copies of ''The Rules'' for the authors to sign. Others asked the rabbi for matchmaking tips.</p>
        <p>Still others appraised Mr. Bey. He is single and wears cowboy boots.</p>
