        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Tommasini's discussion of the myth of serial ''tyranny'' brought to mind the following lines from the textbook for a music history course I took in college in the mid-70's (''A History of Musical Style'' by Richard L. Crocker, published by McGraw-Hill in 1966): ''Music must move beyond the triad into a 12-tone space. . . . That these things had to be was simply a matter of historical continuity. . . . Only the 12-tone space itself would serve as a common tonal order.'' The idea of a Hegelian dialectic at work in which tonality became ''used up'' and led necessarily into serial composition -- all of this is debatable today, but back then, it was orthodoxy.</p>
