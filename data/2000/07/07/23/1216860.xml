        <p>As a volunteer and a Minnesotan, I read Mosle's article with great interest. She cites Minnesota as a state that continues to offer ample assistance to the working poor. While this may be relatively true, there still are a lot of shattered families here who cannot find adequate, affordable housing and many children from these families who are hungry and in dire need of both medical and emotional help. If what we have in Minnesota is good, I shudder to think what things must be like in the rest of the country.</p>
