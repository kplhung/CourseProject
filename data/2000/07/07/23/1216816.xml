        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have to offer a small but important correction to Edward Hoagland's observation in his review of Stewart O'Nan's ''Circus Fire'' (July 2) that those trapped in the tent might have saved themselves simply by ''lifting the canvas sidewall and stepping outside.'' The sidewalls were pegged down to keep people from slipping into the show under them and completely blocked off by the rows of wooden bleachers. The only escape route for those located near the tent entrance by Row A was to run up the bleacher stairs to where a gap had been left between the roof and the sidewall and where one could (with luck) slide down a rope outside the sidewalls to safety -- if one could get over the snow fence also surrounding the tent to keep out interlopers.</p>

        <p>I was a lucky 11-year-old who took this route, having wondered a few moments before the fire broke out how one could possibly escape the crush that would inevitably block the main entrance, where most of the 167 who died returned to their deaths. I still have my ticket stub (Row C). Ringling Brothers offered a refund, but. . . .</p>
