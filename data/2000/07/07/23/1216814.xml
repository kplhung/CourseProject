        <p>AFFINITY</p>
        <p>By Sarah Waters.</p>
        <p>352 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Riverhead Books. $24.95.</p>
        <p>There are two kinds of mystery novels. The first gives us the crime and the clues; the guilty party is then unmasked and the mystery solved. In the other, the crime is solved but not the mystery, which arises from a dark corner of the human condition. Sarah Waters's remarkable second novel, ''Affinity,'' is both of these -- and also a wrenching love story.</p>
        <p>The central character, Margaret Prior, is an unmarried, upper-class Victorian Englishwoman who has recently attempted suicide and who, as part of her recovery program, has turned to charity work. Armed only with secondhand experience (she has read the authoritative work of the day, Mayhew's ''Criminal Prisons of London''), she begins to visit the women's ward in Millbank Prison, ostensibly to help improve the spiritual lives of the inmates. Among the thieves, prostitutes and murderers, one woman catches her notice: Selina Dawes, a spiritualist convicted, after one of her sessions turned deadly, of fraud and assault. The more Margaret learns of Selina, the more she is attracted to her -- and the more she is convinced of her innocence.</p>
        <p>The tale is told through alternating selections from the journals of the two women: short entries by Selina, written in 1872 and 1873, before her arrest, and a more detailed narrative describing Margaret's life during her prison visits, from Sept. 24, 1874, until Jan. 21, 1875. After Margaret's father dies, her mother tells her: ''Now . . . you must take up your proper duties in the house. . . . Your place is here, at your mother's side.'' Margaret has no friends, no future, no prospects in her circumscribed life, so it's little wonder that she looks at Selina and thinks, ''You are like me.'' Is this love at first sight? Not quite. But the recognition of their affinity will fuel Margaret's obsession with Selina. Much later in the book, Selina challenges her by asking, ''Will you go on being a prisoner, in your own dark cell, forever?''</p>
        <p>Margaret's motive for keeping her journal is therapeutic: ''I mean this writing not to turn me back upon my own thoughts, but . . . to keep the thoughts from coming at all. . . . For I have cataloged my visit, I have traced my path across the female gaol.'' However, as her attachment to Selina grows, she acknowledges her failure: ''I thought that I could make my life into a book that had no life or love in it. . . . Now I can see that my heart has crept across these pages, after all.''</p>
        <p>What unfolds is a spiritual seduction and a record of Margaret's deep longing, intensified by the enforced separation of the two main characters and the absence of explicit sex, fantasized or real. (This is a radical departure from Waters's first novel, a lesbian picaresque, also set in late Victorian England, called ''Tipping the Velvet.'') That intimacy should develop between female warders and their prisoners is not surprising, nor is the reversal of roles after a prisoner is discharged and the bereft warder must stay on, a captive of the institution that employs her. The persuasive Selina assures Margaret that the spirits have arranged for her arrest and imprisonment so ''that we might meet and, meeting, know -- and knowing, join. . . . You were seeking me, your own affinity.'' Her explanation is a version of Plato's myth in ''Symposium'': ''We have been cut, two halves, from the same piece of shining matter. . . . Our flesh does not love: our flesh is the same, and longs to leap to itself.'' The seduction succeeds because Selina raises their personal affinity to a higher level, suggesting a connection in which Margaret, isolated by her loneliness, longs to believe.</p>
        <p>It seems that spiritual visitors are willing servants to the professional medium. When a bouquet of orange blossoms appears in Margaret's room and nobody knows who sent them, it is Selina's uncanny knowledge of the most private details of Margaret's life that makes the explanation sound plausible: ''The spirits carried them.'' When Selina's shorn hair, kept in the storage room that holds everything the women wore and brought with them on their arrival (and which Margaret has seen and longed for), appears one night on her pillow, she has no doubt that Selina ''had sent it to me, from her dark place, across the city, across the night.'' So when Selina proposes to send herself beyond the prison walls in order that she and Margaret can run off to Italy, Margaret does not hesitate to make all the arrangments, and with the pleasure of a bride anticipating her honeymoon.</p>
        <p>Is this magic? the skeptical reader asks. Is Selina's power genuine or fake? Her journal reveals that before her arrest she was paid for conducting seances. The newspaper files that Margaret peruses for information about Selina's case cry ''false,'' yet several pages in the prisoner's notes reveal a well-defined belief in the spirit world. They also suggest that, as in the theater, spiritual events can have material causes: ''To make an object luminous. -- Purchase a quantity of luminous paint, preferably from a shop in a district where you are not known.''</p>
        <p>The real power in this book belongs not to Selina but to the author herself. Through the lens of her late-20th-century consciousness, she pictures their world, even as she flawlessly renders the tone and diction of these 19th-century women's experiences. Admirers of Waters's first novel will recognize her consummate skill in evoking a sense of place -- a particularly challenging task in the first half of ''Affinity,'' in which Margaret sets out to write a factual catalog of her visits. Waters manages to imbue a wealth of potentially dry descriptive material with the emotion Margaret has tried to suppress, finding powerful metaphors in the prisoner's woeful circumstances.</p>
        <p>As Selina once led seekers into the ''dark seance'' when she was free, now she is led into a dark cell as punishment for striking a matron. ''The dark cell has a gate across it,'' Margaret recounts, ''and a door, and then another door, padded with straw. The women are put in it with their arms fastened, and the darkness smothers them.'' At night, Margaret looks for the darkest place in her bedroom so she can be ''with her, and close to her. . . . I felt the cell about me, the jacket upon me.''</p>
        <p>Will Selina Dawes succeed in sending herself across the city like a night letter to the woman who loves her? Can the medium and her accomplice find happiness in Italy? To give away the ending would be a crime.</p>
