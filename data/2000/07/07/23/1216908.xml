        <p>Q: Your team is pretty remarkable. You're from Sierra Leone; Ronald Cerritos is from El Salvador; Khodadad Azizi is from Iran. That's sort of an all-star team of beleaguered nations. Does the situation in your home countries produce a special bond among you? Is it hard for you guys to concentrate on the game?</p>
        <p>I try not to put my burden on these guys. With Cerritos, we talk about it sometimes. Especially when we travel, I get to looking up at the ceiling and thinking, ''Oh, God, this can't be.'' Cerritos will come and say, ''Hey, what's happening?'' I say, ''I'm worrying about Sierra Leone.'' He understands. And every game I have times when the ball is down the other end. I have thousands of people watching me, but my mind will drift to what's going on back home. Then I'll snap out of it.</p>

        <p>Q: Your team is pretty remarkable. You're from Sierra Leone; Ronald Cerritos is from El Salvador; Khodadad Azizi is from Iran. That's sort of an all-star team of beleaguered nations. Does the situation in your home countries produce a special bond among you? Is it hard for you guys to concentrate on the game?</p>
        <p>I try not to put my burden on these guys. With Cerritos, we talk about it sometimes. Especially when we travel, I get to looking up at the ceiling and thinking, ''Oh, God, this can't be.'' Cerritos will come and say, ''Hey, what's happening?'' I say, ''I'm worrying about Sierra Leone.'' He understands. And every game I have times when the ball is down the other end. I have thousands of people watching me, but my mind will drift to what's going on back home. Then I'll snap out of it.</p>
        <p>You started your career in El Salvador. What's the difference between playing there, where soccer once started an actual war, and in Silicon Valley, where Internet millionaires are talking on their cell phones?</p>
        <p>The U.S. crowds, they don't throw things at you. But when you play in Latin America, most times they have to have a police cordon surround the field to block flying objects and flying alcohol and flying urine. That smell stayed in my nose for like a week. Oh, my goodness, I never felt so terrible and so -- I don't know how to say it -- cheap, and I thought, What am I doing here? And if you lose, people cry -- they cry! -- and so you think twice before you lose a game.</p>
        <p>What's going on back home? Have you had relatives killed in the fighting there?</p>
        <p>Yes, more than 20, but there are hundreds of thousands of others that have their own horror stories, you know. I've done quite well and earn a good living, so I can afford to help, but it's never enough.</p>
        <p>Do people in Sierra Leone follow soccer anymore or are they too busy just trying to stay alive? Do people there know about your success?</p>
        <p>I am very popular back there. People know about me, and when they call their family here, they find out about me. But they don't even have a domestic league right now. We do have a national team again, for the first time since 1994, but I have no idea how they're doing it, because the country is in such turmoil. I told them that I would go down if they could guarantee my safety. We're going to have a game against Liberia in February, and I would very gladly play.</p>
        <p>Because they've been backing the rebels in Sierra Leone? Would that give you more incentive to w</p>
        <p>We've always been sporting rivals with them, but now I guess it's going to switch into a grudge. The thing is, it wasn't the nation of Liberia that supported those guerrillas; it was their president, Charles Taylor. But it would be nice to beat them, you know? That would be good, to win and dance around their field with our flag.</p>
        <p>Would you have to be careful about which political group was behind Sierra Leone's team?</p>
        <p>When I played there before, people tried to talk about certain things that are politically inclined, and I immediately said: ''I'm not here to play for you. I'm not here to play for the president or the ruling party. I'm here to play for the flag, for the people for the country.'' I don't like politics. I don't trust them. More than anything, I want the country to be stable, so the people can enjoy a normal life.</p>
        <p>Do you consider the surprise vote to award the World Cup to Germany in 2006 instead of South Africa to be racially motivated?</p>
        <p>Of course. Europe has hosted the World Cup how many times? They gave it to Asia. They gave it to the United States. What happened to Africa? It's sick. I can't even believe that something like that is going on in the world today.</p>
        <p>Until some future return, do you consider yourself an American?</p>
        <p>I am a Sierra Leonian. I will always be, even though I will have dual citizenship. But I think more like an American now. I think about investments, the stock market, American sports and entertainment. But then again, I know I have my country on my mind. It's not something that you can easily forget. --</p>
