        <p>BETSY BACH couldn't believe the chutzpah of it.</p>
        <p>When Bell Atlantic originally approached her synagogue, Congregation Kol Ami, in the fall of 1998 about the possibility of building a 100-foot cellular tower on the property here, board members and members of the congregation spent nearly a year debating the proposal before rejecting it.</p>
        <p>''Our board decided that it wasn't a good use of our property,'' said Ken Simon, current president of the congregation and its treasurer when the issue was first discussed. ''It's not in keeping with our spiritual and community mission.''</p>
        <p>So imagine Mrs. Bach's chagrin to find that Omnipoint Communications had entered into a contract with Kol Ami's neighbor, the Fenway Golf Club, and was seeking White Plains approval to install a 150-foot cellular tower on a corner of the property that abuts not only estate homes on Soundview Avenue but also a playground on Kol Ami's property.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty rude to go to our neighbors and put up essentially the same thing that we turned down,'' said Mrs. Bach, who is a fourth-generation member at Kol Ami. Although the company has said that the top one-third of the structure would be designed to resemble a tree, she said, ''It's still hiding an evil underneath.''</p>
        <p>Disputes about where to put cellular phone towers have added another wrinkle to the not-in-my-backyard skirmishes in suburban communities across the country; the added element of a border war only sharpens this debate.</p>
        <p>The residents that would be directly affected by the 150-foot tower live in White Plains, although some Scarsdale residents who are the golf club's neighbors may also be affected. Most of the land of the Fenway Golf Club is in Scarsdale, but the part where the tower would go up falls under White Plains' jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>''It's tower dumping,'' said Michael Moss, whose house is next to both Kol Ami and the Fenway Golf Club and who admits that concerns about property values as well as aesthetics have prompted his opposition. ''Scarsdale has a coverage gap in cellular phones, but Scarsdale also has zoning regulations on the books that are very restrictive.''</p>
        <p>Kim Thompson, corporate communications manager for Voice Stream, corporate parent for Omnipoint, said: ''This was the location that was offered by the golf club. The main reason we've chosen to locate there is to obtain coverage we need to have in that area.''</p>
        <p>In February 1998, the village of Scarsdale enacted legislation that specified the distance that cell towers could be placed, relative to homes, schools and houses of worship. In a residential neighborhood, the distance is 350 feet, while for the village's municipal properties and commercially zoned areas and golf clubs, it's 125 feet.</p>
        <p>Mayor Joseph M. Delfino of White Plains said he had asked the corporation counsel to look into legislation controlling cellular towers.</p>
        <p>He added: ''My objective is to not affect the quality of life for the residents. No member of the golf club would want this near their home.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Citron, president of the Fenway Golf Club, said: ''We have an agreement with Omnipoint. Obviously, we will do anything within reason to assist Omnipoint and the neighbors to finalize this project. The issue is between Omnipoint and the neighbors. We believe that ultimately the cell tower will benefit everyone.'' He added that the golf club's contract with Omnipoint is contingent on the city's approval.</p>
        <p>Christopher Kaye, a planner for White Plains, which held a public hearing on the proposed tower earlier this week, said: ''The Planning Board felt that all possible scenarios had not been presented. Instead of a single 150-foot tower, there were other methods to consider. At the meeting, we heard the application, listened to the neighbors and developed questions that would allow all alternatives to be explored.'' Omnipoint's application is on the agenda for the Aug. 8 meeting.</p>
        <p>The Fenway Golf Club, which has about 340 members, would receive annual revenues of about $70,000 from Omnipoint and its four other wireless partners on the tower, which would translate into a savings of $205 on annual fees of $11,000, according to some club members.</p>
        <p>''This has been put through without membership approval,'' said Robert Moss, a member of the Fenway Golf Club for 50 years and Michael Moss's father.</p>
        <p>Saying that the tower would be visible from 50 percent of the course, he added: ''I'm upset aesthetically, and it's not a classy thing to do. It makes Fenway look bad.''</p>
