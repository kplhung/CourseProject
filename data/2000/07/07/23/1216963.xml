        <p>WANT to bring a room of preservationists to a rolling boil? Just say two words: ''vinyl siding.'' In many communities you'll see plenty of nice old houses cloaked with vinyl, aluminum and asphalt coverings. It's just the kind of thing historic district regulations are designed to prevent, and even dedicated vinyl lovers in historic districts don't even bother to apply because they know they'll be turned down.</p>
        <p>But Samuel and Cynthia Green were determined to move ahead with the installation of vinyl siding on their 1909 house at 245 Fenimore Street in Brooklyn, in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens Historic District, and nothing was going to stop them -- at first.</p>
        <p>The north side of Fenimore Street, from Flatbush to Rogers Avenues, was the lower edge of an eight-square-block area sold off by the Lefferts family in the 1890's. Their 18th-century homestead originally stood at Midwood Street and Flatbush Avenue but is now just inside the boundary of Prospect Park. The first developers put up tightly packed row houses. But when the land at 241, 245 and 249 Fenimore Street came up, the developer Henry Terboss built more suburban-style wooden houses, completed in 1909.</p>
        <p>The Colonial-revival designs of his architect, Robert W. Firth, slightly varied, but each house had a wide front porch. To judge from later photographs they were plain clapboard on the first floor, with shingles on the second and third. The first occupants included Bernard Maltz, 39, a Russian-born painting contractor, who lived at 245 with his family, and Michael Ginnane, 52, Irish-born and in the ice business, who lived at 249 with his wife and eight children -- seven daughters and a son.</p>
        <p>In the 1920's, property restrictions prohibited multiple dwellings in this area. That was when Bernard J. O'Connor lived at 245 Fenimore -- nicknamed ''Smiling Barney,'' he had served with the police force from 1902 to 1928, retiring to serve as the police chief for the Sea Gate community near Coney Island until his death in 1932.</p>
        <p>Photographs of the area in the 1940's show that most of the houses were intact -- but then came the home-improvement craze of the 1950's and 1960's.</p>
        <p>Gloria White's house, at 241 Fenimore Street, was covered with yellow and green aluminum siding sometime after her mother, Gwendolyn Euphemia Hackett, bought it in 1960. ''She just got tired of worrying about the paint and trim,'' said Mrs. White, a retired medical records clerk who subscribes to Old House Journal and is a member of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</p>
        <p>She has a 50-year-old powder blue Chambers stove, bristling with chrome fittings.  Most of the woodwork in her house is intact, with oak floors and unusual borders. Mrs. White has had stained-glass windows copied from the original designs of other windows in the house.</p>
        <p>She does not like the siding, but said that ''at 72, I'm not removing it -- who knows what's underneath?'' Some trim was cut off during the installation, and the siding looks faded and worn, although still serviceable.  But no one would confuse it with the original design -- a Palladian window was squared off and the siding seems to engulf the house.</p>
        <p>Dorothy Joseph's house, at 249 Fenimore Street, was probably re-sided earlier -- the broad, gray asphalt shingles on her upper floors look like they are from the 1950's.  Mrs. Joseph, who retired as principal of Public School 27 in Red Hook, has also restored parts of the interior, and was head of a neighborhood group when the eight-block Prospect Lefferts Gardens Historic District was designated in 1979. She is happy with the landmark designation but noted that there is work that goes on without the required landmarks permits.</p>
        <p>Right between Mrs. White and Mrs. Joseph is 245 Fenimore Street, the Green house. The upper two floors of the Green house are covered in baby blue modern siding, and the couple applied last summer to the Landmarks Preservation Commission to cover the first floor in vinyl siding.</p>
        <p>Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the commission, said that commission staff members explained to the Greens that the policy is not to permit synthetic siding on main facades. Preservationists maintain that siding gives a house a profoundly different look from that of historic materials, that it can trap moisture and that architectural details are often cut away or simplified to permit installation.</p>
        <p>Most applicants fold up with such a response, but the Greens pressed on, and even had a hearing scheduled for March 28. Coincidentally, that was when the Vinyl Siding Institute announced its annual awards, which include a division for historic restoration -- a contradiction in terms for orthodox preservationists. The institute's web site, www.vinylsiding.org, has a page disputing the arguments of preservationists, noting that some installers can do sensitive installations and that vinyl siding can be installed so that it does not trap moisture.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Green said that saving the cost on repeated painting is a minor issue. Rather, she said, she and her husband are much more interested in reducing drafts and heat loss in the house, and they want to ''give it a facelift.''</p>
        <p>She also noted that most of the houses in the area already have modern siding. ''If others have it,'' she said, ''why make such a big deal about it?'' They bought the house in 1986.</p>
        <p>Samuel Green, the bishop of the Gospel Tabernacle Church of Jesus Christ Apostolic in Brooklyn, also owns a 38-unit apartment house in Brooklyn and travels frequently setting up new churches in other parts of the country. This winter, while the matter was hanging, he said: ''I'm waiting on them, because I like to be guided by the law. But if I can't, I'm going to go around them.''</p>
        <p>But the Greens have retreated. The March hearing was canceled, and Mr. Green said this month that ''things have just stopped.'' First the landmarks commission offered them a low-interest loan for preservation-type repairs, and it got the nonprofit New York Landmarks Conservancy to try to find other ways to meet the Greens' needs.</p>
        <p>But Bishop Green has not accepted the loan or the conservancy's help. He said recently that it finally came down to money and vision. As to the money, he said it would cost him $30,000 to rip out rotted wood, insulate, and repair and paint -- versus just $13,000 for vinyl siding.</p>
        <p>And as to vision, Bishop Green said he remained convinced that siding was the way to go: ''It keeps up the value, plus you don't want your house to look like the worst in the neighborhood.''</p>
