        <p>The conventions are the only reality shows nobody wants to watch.</p>
        <p>In television, drama is being pushed out by reality, but in politics, reality is being pushed out because it lacks drama. Or perhaps because it lacks reality.</p>
        <p>Politics has become so artificial, prewashed, prechewed and preordained that there is no chance for bite and spontaneity.</p>
        <p>Without bite and spontaneity, there is no chance for ratings. Without ratings, there is no chance for rapt attention from the networks. And without network prime time, how can a presidential candidate persuade us he is the One?</p>
        <p>If red, white and blue confetti falls in an empty living room, does it get in anybody's hair?</p>
        <p>Viewers' embrace of ''The West Wing'' puts the lie to the notion that Americans won't watch substantive discussions of ideas. Ideas just have to be presented with real human passion.</p>
        <p>But since the exit of John McCain, who managed to make campaign finance reform seem romantic, it's been hard to find real human passion anywhere but on a fictional TV drama.  It's impossible to tell what George W. Bush and Al Gore really care about, besides not making mistakes.</p>
        <p>There has been moaning about how awful it is that the networks are cutting back coverage to practically nothing and shunting it off to cable. But given what lousy TV the conventions are -- dull, obsolete, self-serving -- the parties should feel lucky that they haven't been relegated to Webcasts.</p>
        <p>As programmers here at the summer TV press tour scramble to put reality on their schedules -- UPN is looking for shockumentaries about Nasty Neighbors, Cheating Spouses and perhaps even World's Meanest Ladies -- I asked television's leading reality impresario how the conventions could be made more compelling.</p>
        <p>Michael Davies, the British-born producer of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' thinks American politics has boxed itself in:</p>
        <p>''The great Monty Hall once said great TV has one moment where the protagonist either wins everything or loses everything. Quiz shows, the best sporting events, our favorite sitcom episodes -- they all have that. Conventions have lost that. They need a new hook, a moment of 'Drumroll, please.' They have to engineer more drama.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies wryly suggests the always-popular vote-out. ''Like 'Survivor,' you kick out one state every year, or vote somebody off the Democratic National Committee every night.''</p>
        <p>The conventions need to get interactive. ''Vice-presidential selection could be more like 'Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?' and people could vote from home,'' Mr. Davies says. ''Or like 'Blind Date.' We  follow the nominee as he goes out with three vice-presidential prospects. Maybe we see pop-up thought bubbles that tell us what he really feels about a possible mate -- how the guy droning on about ethanol is a snore.'' (Wouldn't we have loved to see the pop-up bubbles over Dick Cheney's head as he interviewed V.P. contenders: ''I'm better, I'm better, I'm better.'')</p>
        <p>The producer muses that the best way for a convention to win an audience is to pay people to watch -- let viewers win money by guessing how many times George W. Bush will use the word ''heart'' in his speech.</p>
        <p>''The art of performance has been lost in American politics,'' he contends. ''You can find C-Span debates in Parliament that are utterly absorbing. The pols are funny and liable to say stupid things when there aren't 100 people writing and producing for them.</p>
        <p>''America should import the British system for one convention week. You have the two parties on opposite sides of a big convention center, like  Parliament, jeering, pointing across the aisle, while Bush and Gore debate each other extemporaneously. You'd have to have somebody in the role of the speaker, Betty Boothroyd -- maybe Judge Judy.</p>
        <p>''As TV producers say, the conventions need to relax and find their voice. They've lost touch with the original idea. There's no introduction of characters, no conflict, no second act, and the resolution is predetermined.</p>
        <p>''And on top of all that, the lighting is really bad.''</p>
