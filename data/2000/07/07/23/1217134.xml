        <p>ROBERTO AQUINO, 14, says he finds ''false gold'' in garbage. A scavenger on Manila's garbage mountain when he is not in school, he specializes in copper wire. On a good day he can earn half as much as his fifth-grade teacher.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of people died here two weeks ago when the seven-story-high mountain, loosened by monsoon rains, collapsed on their shantytown. Like their neighbors, they lived here amid the filth and flies and degradation because the living was good. Mostly upwardly mobile migrants from the barren countryside, they were feeding their families and putting their children through school. Like Roberto, they had struck gold.</p>
        <p>''Say you have a family of four,'' said Matthew Westfall, an urban development specialist with the Asian Development Bank, which is based here. ''The kids go to school part time and pick trash part time. You could get up to 15,000 or 16,000 pesos a month, possibly.'' That sum, about $400, ''puts you above the poverty line,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The people of the dumpsite, which they call Promised Land, are not an aberration. They are part of the changing face of poverty -- a vast population shift taking place in much of the world, from the joblessness and hunger of the countryside to the comparative wealth of the cities. But for most of these migrants, that comparative wealth is found in places like this dumpsite, part of a growing sea of poverty that laps at the edges of small, high-rise islands of urban affluence.</p>
        <p>In Asia, where cities of 10 million people or more are spreading as fast as anywhere in the world, this urban landscape is replacing the fields and trees of the villages for an increasing proportion of the population.</p>
        <p>Thirty-five years ago, Mr. Westfall said, only one in five Asians lived in cities. Today the ratio is one in three. Twenty years from now, more than half the population will be urban. In 1990, he said, the region's cities needed a total of $38 billion a year to provide urban services like water, sanitation and transport. In 20 years that figure is expected to rise to an impossible $292 billion.</p>
        <p>These huge ''megacities,'' groaning with their burden of the disenfranchised poor, will dominate the next century, it is said, the way the nation-state dominated the last century and empires ruled in the century before.</p>
        <p>Urbanization, of course, is not just an Asian phenomenon. Nor is the misery of the poor. Garbage mountains rise in Latin America and Africa as well. But it is in Asia, perhaps, with its enormous population pressures, that the issue is drawn most strikingly.</p>
        <p>Manila today, for example, has 13 percent of the  Philippines' 74 million people but generates 30 to 40 percent of the nation's wealth. Bangkok has 10 percent of Thailand's population but generates 40 percent of its wealth. ''People in rural areas have no alternative but to migrate,'' said Anil Deolalikar, a professor of economics at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
        <p>But garbage dumps aside, said Naved Hamid, a senior policy planner with the Asian Development Bank,  these poor see little of the cities' wealth.</p>
        <p>There is no one pattern for urban poverty and therefore no single cure. In China, the pattern is predominantly one of a vast floating population of migrant workers who follow jobs from city to city. In Manila, where many urban services have broken down, it also includes people like civil servants and teachers, whose pay puts them above the poverty line but who often have no alternative to living in the ugliest of slums.</p>
        <p>The urban underclass for the most part lives apart from the social and economic structure of its city, invisible to most residents and without the political weight to demand their share of services. So they create their own separate -- though dependent -- economies. Some 80,000 squatters cluster around Manila's garbage mountain, for example. They include perhaps 3,000 scavengers and another 9,000 or so people whose livelihoods depend directly on what urban experts call ''the recycling waste chain.''</p>
        <p>As planners seek new ways to address the growing disaster of urban poverty, the world's millions of slum dwellers find their own ways to survive. The art of scavenging, it appears, is one of the great tributes to  human inventiveness. There are children who dive for golf balls in the water hazards of golf courses and there are daring teenagers who scurry for brass shell casings on military firing ranges.</p>
        <p>In Laos, people use old bombshells to construct their houses. In America, the urban poor dig for aluminum cans (and cold slices of pizza) in garbage bins.</p>
        <p>In Nigeria this month -- in a tragedy that is a companion to the garbage landslide in Manila -- hundreds of scavengers died in an explosion and fire while  trying to earn their living by puncturing a pipeline and siphoning off gasoline.</p>
        <p>PEOPLE like this not only make a living; they make a home for themselves. The shanties at Manila's dump are hung with flower pots and posters of soccer teams. There are tiny barbershops and ice cream stands. There are births and weddings and school graduations.</p>
        <p>Nine people in the family of Jennifer Gino Evangelista died in the landslide, including her parents. Twenty-one survived. None of them want to move away.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, said Mrs. Evangelista, 27, her father brought the family here from the countryside after taking them from place to place in search of a living. ''Every year we would move,'' she said. ''We never had a permanent address. We were tourists in our own country.''</p>
        <p>That homeless life ended here on the fringes of the Promised Land dump.</p>
        <p>''This is where we've stayed the longest -- 12 years,'' she said. ''This is where we've multiplied. This is where we've put down roots. So this is our home now.''</p>
