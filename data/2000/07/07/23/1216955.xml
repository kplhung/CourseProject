        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anthony Tommasini writes of ''disdain'' and ''prejudice against'' tonal music in ''academic circles,'' and specifically of the ''dismissal'' of the tonal music of Harold Shapero. In the interest of fairness, I have to report that, as a student at Princeton in the mid-70's, I encountered Shapero's Symphony for Classical Orchestra in B-flat major as a topic of study in not one, but two courses, one taught by J. K. Randall and one by Milton Babbitt. I also studied, and was encouraged to admire, works by Copland, Neo-Classical works by Stravinsky and many other works that Mr. Tommasini asks readers to think would have been ruled out of the curriculum.</p>

        <p>Anthony Tommasini writes of ''disdain'' and ''prejudice against'' tonal music in ''academic circles,'' and specifically of the ''dismissal'' of the tonal music of Harold Shapero. In the interest of fairness, I have to report that, as a student at Princeton in the mid-70's, I encountered Shapero's Symphony for Classical Orchestra in B-flat major as a topic of study in not one, but two courses, one taught by J.

I also studied, and was encouraged to admire, works by Copland, Neo-Classical works by Stravinsky and many other works that Mr. Tommasini asks readers to think would have been ruled out of the curriculum.</p>
        <p>In fact, the overwhelming majority of the music I studied at Princeton was tonal. (The verbal part of my dissertation was about Mozart.) I do not compose 12-tone music, I didn't when I was a student, and I never got the feeling that anyone particularly wanted me to. I sometimes have a hard time getting people to believe this, since they have been told so many times that 12-tone music seeks to drive out all other music; but it's the plain truth.</p>
        <p>I am in no position to contradict Mr. Tommasini's reports of his experience ''in the trenches'' at Yale in the early 1970's. But my experience contradicts his claim that this was characteristic of the entire university scene. My education didn't feel like a trench at all.</p>
