        <p>Saying that Republicans in Congress were treating the projected federal budget surplus ''as if they'd won it in the lottery,'' President Clinton today defended his promise to veto the main tax cuts passed by the House and Senate, and he called for bipartisan cooperation in setting the nation's fiscal priorities.</p>
        <p>In his weekly radio address, taped in Japan -- where he is meeting with the leaders of the big industrial nations -- Mr. Clinton said Republicans were rushing toward spending all of the projected surplus outside of Social Security on tax cuts that would go primarily to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>He said the drive for tax cuts was putting at risk the government's opportunity to eliminate the national debt, failing to address the needs of working people and undermining efforts to shore up the Social Security and Medicare systems.</p>
        <p>His comments came at the end of two weeks in which Republicans completed work on two major tax-cutting bills, one that would reduce taxes for married couples and another that would repeal the federal estate tax. Congress is still working on bills that would expand tax-deductible contributions to retirement savings accounts and roll back part of the tax on Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>''I cannot sign one expensive tax break after another without any coherent strategy for safeguarding our financial future,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>But Republicans showed no inclination to back down.</p>
        <p>Senator Rod Grams, Republican of Minnesota, said Mr. Clinton did not understand that the surplus came from tax revenues and ought to be returned to the people who earned it, the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Clinton, we're asking you to put aside election-year politics and help families live the American dream,'' Mr. Grams said in the weekly Republican radio address. ''If you do your part and sign the bills we have sent you to repeal the marriage penalty and death tax, Americans can keep a little more of their hard-earned money, for their families and their future.''</p>
