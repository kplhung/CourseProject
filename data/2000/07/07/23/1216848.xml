        <p>IF there is such a thing as tourist hell, it might look something like the view from my taxi as I rode from Tenerife Sur airport in the Canary Islands to the ferry dock: a wall of anonymous concrete-box condos along a beach covered with a thousand blue deck chairs, lined up  like parading soldiers.

        <p>IF there is such a thing as tourist hell, it might look something like the view from my taxi as I rode from Tenerife Sur airport in the Canary Islands to the ferry dock: a wall of anonymous concrete-box condos along a beach covered with a thousand blue deck chairs, lined up  like parading soldiers. I smiled, for this tourist was only passing through on her way to a place she was pretty sure would be paradise, just an hour's hydrofoil ride away.</p>
        <p>The Canary Islands, which belong to Spain, have become well known as a haven for mass package tourism, thanks to the success that two of them, Tenerife and Gran Canaria, have had in attracting sun-hungry northern Europeans. Poorly connected by air to the United States -- there aren't any direct scheduled flights from here -- the Canaries don't see many Americans, who have their own, more convenient versions of Tenerife in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>I'm always reluctant to dismiss destinations said to be spoiled by tourism -- mainly because popular destinations are usually at the other end of frequent, and cheap, airline connections. The Canaries, while difficult to reach from here, are an inexpensive two-and-a-half-hour hop from most major European cities, including Madrid, where I was traveling last May (I got a round-trip Madrid-Tenerife ticket on Iberia for about $160). What's more, I've found that it's usually pretty easy to ditch the crowd in so-called touristy places by taking a short ride off the beaten track by car, boat or train.</p>
        <p>I suspected this might be true of the Canaries and, as I planned my 10-day trip there from New York, I found evidence to support my theory. There are seven main islands in the archipelago, and the four least trafficked, according to the guidebooks, receive a fraction of the visitors of Gran Canaria, Tenerife or Lanzarote. Scanning the descriptions of the less popular Canaries, I became most interested in La Gomera, a round volcanic island 20 miles west of Tenerife. Although it is 146 square miles, less than a tenth the size of Rhode Island, La Gomera has an astonishing variety of landscapes -- lush, terraced farm valleys, desert-dry coasts, and a high-altitude laurel forest covered in perpetual mists, an ecosystem so rare it has been designated a Unesco World Heritage Monument.</p>
        <p>There was more good news: La Gomera had only one large tourist resort; the rest of its tourist accommodations are a few small hotels and a network of vacation rentals. On the Web I found a site for a private tourist agency, CIT (www.canary-islands.com). Part of a network of independent agencies in the Canaries, CIT connects local homeowners with tourists seeking to stay in a village house or apartment. There were pictures, maps and detailed descriptions of more than two dozen apartments and houses on the site, and the prices were reasonable -- between $35 and $60 a night for the property, depending on the season. (May, when I was visiting, is off season in the Canaries, which are busiest in the winter and during summer vacations.)</p>
        <p>Normally I'd hesitate to book a private apartment for more than a week without first seeing it. But I knew that in Spain, where similar lodging programs operate nationwide, rural tourist home stays are inspected and regulated by local governments. In the Web pictures, the apartments and houses appeared modest but comfortable. I chose a one-bedroom apartment in the Casa La Punta complex in the village of Hermigua (population 2,000) that was described as close to shops and markets, high on a ridge overlooking the sea and the Pico del Teide volcano on nearby Tenerife.</p>
        <p>Casa La Punta also had a fully equipped kitchen, television and a washing machine. It seemed like a lot for only $42 a night. I sent an e-mail message to CIT, and received confirmation by e-mail a few days later.</p>
        <p>And so, on a sunny, cloudless day, a shiny new catamaran deposited me and about a hundred other passengers at the ferry dock in San Sebastian, La Gomera's biggest settlement. Most of my fellow passengers were Germans, headed for the beach community of Valle Gran Rey. That beach has the safest swimming on the island, which has rocky, rough black-sand beaches that are poor by, say, Caribbean standards. Valle Gran Rey is La Gomera's main tourist area, a backpacker's haunt that consists of a profusion of tiny budget hotels and cottages along a black sandy strand on the island's southwestern fringe.</p>
        <p>Hermigua, my destination, was off in the opposite direction, in a deep, narrow valley that cut through the north of the island and ended at the sea. Getting there (or anywhere else in La Gomera, for that matter) involves a tricky ride over a mountainous road, so I'd decided to stay in San Sebastian for one night, and leave the next morning. Shouldering my gear, I walked about 200 yards to the center of town, and inquired about a room at the clean-looking but plain  Hotel Garajonay. I negotiated a deal for a single at $25 a night (breakfast was $3.27 extra), not really expecting much. When I turned the key and saw the bright, large room with windowed doors opening to a little deck with chairs and a pretty view of cottages clinging to San Sebastian's steep slopes, I felt happy I'd chosen this particular Canary island.</p>
        <p>San Sebastian is a town with a past -- more than 500 years ago it was Christopher Columbus's pit stop, the place where he docked to provision his ships for the sail westward. It's said that he did more than provision here -- the accounts hint at a romance between Columbus and Beatriz de Bobadilla, the widow of La Gomera's Spanish governor.</p>
        <p>Intrigued by the stories, I spent the sunset hours strolling around the ancient buildings in town -- the forbidding, square Torre del Conde, built as a fortress in 1488, and the mission-style Iglesia de la Asuncion, where Columbus is said to have prayed for a good voyage. I was after colonial atmosphere, but sadly, most of San Sebastian's oldest buildings are history. In their place is a modern port town with a few outdoor cafes and lots of little shops selling electronics and dry goods -- the commercial center of the island.</p>
        <p>Eager to get to my place in the country, I woke up early the next morning and arranged to rent a car  with Cicar, the main car rental company in the Canary Islands, which has an office near the Garajonay. My weeklong rental of an Opel automatic sedan cost $218, including insurance. Armed with a map, I set out for Hermigua, and arrived there after 45 anguished minutes on some of the most terrifying mountain roads I've ever experienced. La Gomera is the top of an old volcano. Deep fissures from ancient lava flows scar the mountainsides and add topographical excitement -- La Gomera is a place where up and down matter as much as, if not more than, right and left, or north and south.</p>
        <p>Although I was unnerved from the driving, my heart leaped when I finally reached the top of the Hermigua Valley. There, spread below me, I could see small pastel houses and church belltowers scattered amid green terraced slopes as dense and intricate as those of Bali. At the end of the beautiful valley, an intensely blue Atlantic Ocean crashed on a black, rocky shore. Across the sea rose the misty volcanic peak of Teide, on Tenerife.</p>
        <p>Dona Juana Lola, the caretaker of Casa La Punta, met me with the keys at the door of the second-floor landing of a three-story building with the keys. In a musical Spanish she told me, ''It's all cleaned up for you.'' The apartment smelled of the strong disinfectant that Spanish housekeepers like to use. But the rooms, painted a bright yellow, with comfy beige sofas in the living room, an impressive round Spanish table in the dining area and twin beds in the bedroom  were even bigger and better than the Internet photos led me to believe. The bathroom was modern, with a shower and no tub.</p>
        <p>Shuttered doors opened to a little balcony from which I could watch the sunrise over Pico del Teide. The only drawback, which I noticed after Dona Juana Lola had left, was that the main road passed directly below this balcony. I'd chosen this roadside location for convenience, without stopping to consider that there might be traffic noise, which there was.</p>
        <p>But it wasn't so bad, and I soon settled into my village vacation. I stocked up on manchego cheese and chorizo, spaghetti, tomatoes and onions, and delicious hot-from-the-oven ciabatta-style bread at the Brito supermarket, about a half mile down the road. I saw only local people there, and few tourists strolling the roads down to the beach or into the center of Hermigua.</p>
        <p>For a day or two I did nothing but read, walk to the beach (it was rough and unswimmable, but fragrant and exhilarating), and cook myself elaborate meals in my good-size kitchen, dinners I'd eat sitting on the balcony watching fantastic purple and orange sunsets. The village, peaceful and sleepy, was just the ticket after a whirlwind of Madrid sightseeing.</p>
        <p>Life slowed down. I relaxed on the couch and finished, in one sitting, the novel that was topping Madrid's best-seller lists, Mario Vargas Llosa's ''Fiesta del Chivo.''</p>
        <p>Paved roads are a fairly recent addition to the landscape of La Gomera; since the time of Columbus, Gomerans have moved on foot from village to village on an intricate network of paths that crisscross the island. These paths remain in heavy use by shepherds, farmers and, lately, foreign hikers, who have discovered in La Gomera a mother lode of good, challenging trails. Nearly every trip in La Gomera involves a steep climb or descent, and the views of forest, sea and mountain are spectacular in all directions.</p>
        <p>THE trails are not very well marked, except for the network that fall within the boundaries of the Parque Nacional de Garajonay, the protected high-laurel forest in the center of the island that is maintained by the Spanish government. The best trail guide and map, the Goldstadt Wanderkarte, is written in German, a language I don't read. And so, starting off on my first walk, about an hour's hike up and over a mountain from Hermigua to a black-sand beach called La Caleta, I had to rely on local help. It arrived in the form of the elderly woman whose backyard I was inadvertedly trespassing upon. ''No, no! El sendero esta por alli!'' she shouted, running out into the yard and waving to show me where the path actually was.</p>
        <p>Later, roaming on my own through brushland covered with wild cactus near the village of Arure, on the other side of the island from Hermigua, I found a better solution to my difficulty in the form of Krista, a Belgian hiker who spoke French, German and English. We met at a crossroads where we had both stopped with maps and were frowning. Laughingly, we became a hiking team -- she'd translate the directions from the German guidebook, and I'd speak Spanish to the local people when the guidebook didn't work -- which was a lot of the time.</p>
        <p>Not only because of language was Krista the perfect hiking partner. We tended to get tired and hungry at the same moments. Indeed, we planned one entire day of hiking around two little village restaurants.</p>
        <p>At the first, La Montana, about 22 miles from Hermigua and an hour's hike off the main road in Las Hayas, we were served an enormous three-course lunch of salad, beans and the local cornmeal cereal called gofio, all prepared by Dona Efigenia, a septuagenarian cook who follows a strict program of vegetarianism. Hours later we dropped our backpacks in another excellent place, Bar-Restaurante Conchita in Arure, where we devoured a meal of rich watercress and potato soup (another local specialty) followed by fresh fish stewed in pepper sauce. Meals were around $7.</p>
        <p>On another day we zoomed to the top of La Gomera's highest mountain, Alto de Garajonay (4,500 feet), then down its slope, through foggy laurel forest (laurisilva). Deep inside the cool and mysterious laurisilva, it felt as if I'd been magically transported to the Rockies -- then, in less than an hour as we descended, the hot, tropical sea-level climate of the island reasserted itself. The combination of such dramatic changes across small distances and the stunning vistas at every turn made hiking a sublime pleasure.</p>
        <p>It was sunny at noon as we reached the summit of Alto de Garajonay, where we could see clear across to Tenerife. Somewhere out there, on the next island, I imagined a battalion of sun worshippers lounging in beach-chair gridlock. But from the lonely heights of La Gomera they seemed as far away as China probably seemed to Columbus.</p>
        <p>The bottom line in La Gomera</p>
        <p>I spent $47.11 a day on food and lodging during nine days and nights on La Gomera in the Canary Islands. I spent an additional $250 (at 183 pesetas to the dollar) to rent an Opel Astra automatic car for eight days (the weekly rate is $218). The main activity, hiking, is free.</p>
        <p>I added a round trip from Madrid to Tenerife to my $420 round-trip ticket from New York; the extra fare came to about $160.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>In San Sebastian, I stayed one night in the clean and comfortable Hotel Garajonay, Calle Ruiz de Padron 17, telephone (34) 92-287-0550, fax (34) 92-287-0554, a business-class establishment in the center of town. My room was on the large side, with a double bed, sunny balcony, and large tiled bathroom with shower. It cost about $25; breakfast was an extra $3.27.</p>
        <p>A local agency, Centro de Iniciativas Turisticas del Norte de La Gomera (CIT) lists cottages and apartments for short-term rental on the island; telephone and fax (34) 92-214-4101; www.canary-islands.com. My one-bedroom apartment in the Casa La Punta cost $42 a night, and was large enough for three people.</p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>I cooked most of my meals in my own kitchen, having bought most of my provisions at the nearby Supermercado Brito in Hermigua, Plaza de la Encarnacion 171, (34) 92214-4113, a small, well-stocked and reasonably priced market.</p>
        <p>There are several restaurants catering to tourists in Hermigua and San Sebastian, but the best meals I had were in small village restaurants on or near the hiking paths.</p>
        <p>Bar Restaurant Conchita, (34) 92-280-4151, in the village of Arure, served delicious local specialties like watercress-potato soup and fish cooked in a homemade pepper sauce. I took home a bottle of the spicy sauce, which is also served on the table as a dipping sauce for the crusty Gomeran bread. Friendly, with a bar always full of local people, Conchita was my favorite haunt. Meals cost about $7 to $10 a person with beer.</p>
        <p>In Las Hayas, another tiny village, is Restaurant La Montana, on the main road (no telephone). A well-known local woman named Dona Efigenia serves up all-vegetarian meals that vary according to her mood (when you eat there, you put yourself in her hands). My hiking companion and I ate a large, leisurely lunch of salad, bread, vegetable soup, gofio (corn meal) and sweet pudding dessert; the bill came to $7 a head with no drinks.</p>
        <p>Transportation</p>
        <p>I rented a car from Canary Islands Car (Cicar), (34) 92-214-1234, fax (34) 92-214-1146, for $218 a week, which included insurance. I paid an additional $23 for gasoline. Rates are cheaper for manual-transmission cars, which I cannot drive. Most of the roads are paved and in reasonable condition, but the mountain terrain makes it necessary to stay very alert and avoid the temptation to eyeball the amazing views, particularly when driving through the foggy highlands. There are modern, air-conditioned buses that run along three designated island routes; they cost about $5 a ride, but run infrequently.</p>
        <p>A high-speed catamaran ferry operated by Lineas Fred Olsen runs between Los Cristianos port in Tenerife and San Sebastian in La Gomera four or five times a day. The round trip is about $25.</p>
        <p>A taxi from the Reina Sofia airport at Tenerife Sur to the ferry dock costs $13.50; the return ride was a bit cheaper, at $11. From the ferry dock at San Sebastian I walked to the Hotel Garajonay in town, but there are plenty of taxis there to meet the boat as it docks.</p>
