        <p>HELEN CROSSON found a place for her library. The state found a new park. Somewhere, Robert Moses is smiling. Or scowling.</p>
        <p>Cold Spring Harbor State Park, Long Island's newest state park, is situated on a 40-acre parcel of wooded land and was known to area hikers as the northern end of the Greenbelt Trail, which winds south in Massapequa. But it was not known to state parks officials, who found out purely by accident that the property was already state-owned.</p>
        <p>Since last summer Ms. Crosson, the director of the Cold Spring Harbor Library, had been looking for a site for a new library. Now sharing 7,000 square feet in the Goosehill Elementary School, the space had become too small to meet the library's needs. Upon inspection of some aerial maps of the area, Ms. Crosson found a state-owned parcel on the bluffs overlooking the harbor.</p>
        <p>The property had been taken by the state in the 1960's in preparation for a bridge to Connecticut that Moses had once hoped to build, according to Ms. Crosson, who brought it to the attention of her state senator, Carl Marcellino. He discovered that the rights to the land were controlled by the Parks Department, and began discussions that led to the leasing of five of its acres for a new library.</p>
        <p>''I met with Commissioner Castro and worked out a deal for $1 a year,'' Senator Marcellino said. ''It's a good marriage for both the state and the community.''</p>
        <p>Moses was famously intolerant of any thwarting of his plans, so it's hard to imagine that he would be pleased by the reuse of the property, despite the legacy of parks he built. But Ms. Crosson, who said several homes were condemned for the never-built roadway, has a different perspective. ''The fact that the state is doing the right thing 40 years later makes the deal so sweet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although the new library is still a few years away, the park is open right now. ''This was a most pleasant surprise,'' said the state parks commissioner, Bernadette Castro, who lives nearby. ''It's like going up into grandma's attic and finding something valuable.''</p>
        <p>The steeply sloped terrain and thick woods of the new park will narrow its appeal. Where hikers and naturalists may cherish it, Frisbee throwers would not. ''It's totally natural,'' said Alane Brady of Huntington, on the trail the other day with her dog. ''A lot of people bring their dogs. I hope they'll allow them.''</p>
        <p>Volunteers of the Long Island Greenbelt Trail Conference have been maintaining the property since that section of the trail was opened in 1986, and will continue to do so, though now they will be assisted by the Parks Department.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be a big help,'' said Nancy Manfredonia, president of the trail conference, which maintains over 150 miles of trails on Long Island. ''It's always wonderful to have that official designation.''</p>
        <p>The Parks Department will be installing interpretive signs throughout the park to point out the native flora and fauna. A house on the site will eventually be used as a visitors' center, said Ms. Castro, who added that aside from a few picnic benches and restrooms, no other changes to the property had been planned.</p>
        <p>For-sale signs surround the park, and new homes have sprouted up on nearly every piece of buildable acreage. While developers rush in to take advantage of the booming housing market, open space is at a premium.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of speculation about that land,'' said Paul Rabinovitch, executive director of the Nature Conservancy's Long Island chapter. He praised Governor Pataki and Commissioner Castro for creating the newest park, and the recently opened Nissequogue River State Park, and for saving more land from development. ''They have done a great job on Long Island in bringing surplus parkland into preservation,'' Mr. Rabinovitch said.</p>
        <p>The new park's parking lot on Harbor Road, Route 25A, has been used primarily by boaters, who use the Huntington Town boat launch across the street. Pat Reiss, a town spokeswoman, said town residents will continue to share the lot, which is owned by the state. ''I don't see any problems,'' she said. ''I've never seen that lot filled to capacity.''</p>
        <p>Commissioner Castro said the state would try to work out some sort of agreement that would allow boaters to continue to share the parking if the state can share the boat launch. ''We would love to have some access to the water,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Cold Spring Harbor Library, which moved from a red-brick building in the village to the Goosehill school in 1987, could not renew its lease with the Cold Spring Harbor school district because the district is looking for more classroom space. But the library will stay where it is for a few more years, according to Ms. Crosson, until a new building can be approved and built in the park.</p>
        <p>''It has been a tremendous challenge at this location,'' she said. ''There is improper storage and inadequate wiring. We want to add computers and Internet access.''</p>
        <p>The site for the new library is a part of the property that some people have used to park their boats, while others have used it for illegal dumping. Construction is ''at least two years away,'' Ms. Crosson said.</p>
        <p>While many residents will welcome a new library, some are skeptical about the influx of traffic the new park may attract to the narrow village streets. ''It's good that they're saving 40 acres and it's good that we're getting a state-of-the-art library and providing more room for the schools,'' said Joe Chiusano, who lives nearby. ''The only concern is increasing the amount of people coming into the area.''</p>
        <p>But the commissioner maintained that the new complex belongs to everyone and she is thrilled about New York's 161st state park. ''This will transform what looks very dilapidated into a nice little setting and one of the most wonderful little libraries on Long Island,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And since this newest park was found by accident, Commissioner Castro said, parks officials are now combing the maps looking for more. ''It's like a treasure hunt,'' she said.</p>
