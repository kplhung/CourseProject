        <p>LEA LOVELESS MAURER, a native of Crestwood, is flying in her bid for further Olympic swimming glory. Literally.

        <p>Badger is the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont, of which Collins is the longtime coach and leader. Mrs. Maurer has flown to meets in Ann Arbor, Mich., Charlotte, N.C., and Montreal.

        <p>LEA LOVELESS MAURER, a native of Crestwood, is flying in her bid for further Olympic swimming glory. Literally. ''She's living in Chicago and training there with her husband, Erik, a former N.C.A.A. champion,'' said John Collins, who started coaching her when she was 11. ''But she has been flying in to compete with Badger in meets leading up to the Olympic trials.''</p>
        <p>Badger is the Badger Swim Club in Larchmont, of which Collins is the longtime coach and leader. Mrs. Maurer has flown to meets in Ann Arbor, Mich., Charlotte, N.C., and Montreal. She wound up her preparation last weekend in the U.S.A. Swimming Challenge on Long Island, touching down to win the 100-meter backstroke in 1:02.33 and the 200-meter backstroke in 2:14.65.</p>
        <p>Next stop: the Olympic Trials in Indianapolis Aug. 9 to 15, with the 100-meter backstroke, Mrs. Maurer's strongest event, the very first day.</p>
        <p>''Basically, she's swimming as well as she ever has,'' said Collins, who first saw her potential as a youngster who ''swam like a hummingbird, her arms moved so fast.''</p>
        <p>The coach continued: ''In Montreal she did a 1:01.7 for 100 meters, which is within a second of her best ever.'' And within reach of Olympic gold in Sydney, Australia, come September. All of which is quite surprising to Mrs. Maurer.</p>
        <p>The winner of eight national and four N.C.A.A. individual titles in the backstroke and a member of more than a dozen championship medley relay teams, she first vaulted to the top of the swimming world at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Her 1:00.82 leadoff backstroke leg not only set an American record but also gave the United States a lead it never relinquished in the 400-meter medley relay, putting a gold medal in her trophy case besides the bronze in the 100-meter backstroke.</p>
        <p>Retirement and an aborted attempt to make the '96 Olympic team followed. ''When I failed to make the team in '96,'' Mrs. Maurer said, ''I figured that was it for big-time swimming.'' She married in April 1997. ''I ate my way through the wedding,'' she said. ''I gained a ton of weight. I tried running and the Stairmaster, but neither kept my attention. So Erik wrote some swimming workouts for me. It was just to get my weight down.''</p>
        <p>Sure it was. Collins turned co-conspirator with a phone call a few weeks later.</p>
        <p>''He told me Badger was competing in a meet in Fort Lauderdale over the Memorial Day weekend, and he needed someone to help coach,'' Mrs. Maurer said. ''He told me it would be fun.</p>
        <p>''But when I got there he said, 'I've entered you in the backstroke just for the heck of it.' I was there, so I figured why not? I hadn't swum seriously since March of 1996, and I was 12 pounds overweight.''</p>
        <p>She broke the Fort Lauderdale pool record she had set as  a 21-year-old in 1992.</p>
        <p>''So I was back in training,'' she said, ''but with no big goals.''</p>
        <p>And with a very full plate. A lifetime Crestwood resident, the new bride was also adjusting to a new city while teaching English at Lake Forest High School, coaching its boys' and girls' swimming teams and also coaching the sports at Northwestern University. Still, she broke her own American record in winning the 100-meter backstroke at the 1998 world championships in 1:00.77.</p>
        <p>But it all caught up to her 25 meters from home in the national championships later that year. ''I started too fast, and at 75 yards I was three meters ahead of the field,'' she recalled, ''and everyone was saying 'wow.' But Erik knew the shape I was in, and he was saying 'unh-oh.' ''</p>
        <p>She faltered and was touched out by her longtime bitter rival, B. J. Bedford, who began celebrating in the pool.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to end on that note,'' Mrs. Maurer said. ''Erik said O.K., let's put family plans off and make a commitment for one more year.'' She cut back to part-time teaching. And full-time medal hunting.</p>
        <p>Collins said: ''She may be 29, but the competitive fire still burns.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Maurer, who has spent so much of the last 20 years in the pool, agreed. ''I think I can be all right in the trials as long as I stay relaxed and confident,'' she said.</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
