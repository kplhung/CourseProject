        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding your article ''Scared Straight Takes a Detour'' (July 9), the idea that it is therapeutic to have violent criminals scream at children is so aberrant that we might ask who came up with it in the first place.</p>
        <p>In fact, research consistently shows such tactics -- and Scared Straight in particular -- to be ineffective. James Finckenauer, a Rutgers Criminology professor, is one among many who tried systematically to evaluate the program's impact. Instead of relying on inmate statements like ''Well, we never saw any of those kids come back,'' Professor Finckenauer compared children with equal degrees of criminal activity who went through the program with those who did not. Those who went through Scared Straight subsequently had more delinquent episodes than those who did not.</p>

        <p>Regarding your article ''Scared Straight Takes a Detour'' (July 9), the idea that it is therapeutic to have violent criminals scream at children is so aberrant that we might ask who came up with it in the first place.</p>
        <p>In fact, research consistently shows such tactics -- and Scared Straight in particular -- to be ineffective. James Finckenauer, a Rutgers Criminology professor, is one among many who tried systematically to evaluate the program's impact. Instead of relying on inmate statements like ''Well, we never saw any of those kids come back,'' Professor Finckenauer compared children with equal degrees of criminal activity who went through the program with those who did not. Those who went through Scared Straight subsequently had more delinquent episodes than those who did not.</p>
        <p>We locked these inmates up forever because we decided they were not fit to interact with ordinary citizens. In Scared Straight, we decide  instead to have them deal with our most sensitive and troubled children.  Good plan! It seems to satisfy something deep inside to us to watch adults scream at children who we think need better direction.</p>
        <p>But is this the way for troubled children to gain guidance, motivation, self-esteem, and life skills? Unfortunately, there is no shortcut to  obtain these.</p>
