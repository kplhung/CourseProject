        <p>The Tour de France is a metaphor for life, Lance Armstrong tells us, because it can be ''exalting and heartbreaking and potentially tragic'' and it can pose ''unspeakably bad luck, unthinkable beauty, yawning senselessness and, above all, a great, deep self-questioning.

        <p>And then he declares that given the choice ''between winning the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer.'' As last year's winner and the favorite to win today, and as a survivor of late stage testicular cancer that had invaded his brain, Armstrong is the only person alive who could even seriously consider such a choice. As with any hero who has returned from somewhere dangerous, he has a story to tell.

        <p>The Tour de France is a metaphor for life, Lance Armstrong tells us, because it can be ''exalting and heartbreaking and potentially tragic'' and it can pose ''unspeakably bad luck, unthinkable beauty, yawning senselessness and, above all, a great, deep self-questioning. It even tests you morally.''</p>
        <p>And then he declares that given the choice ''between winning the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer.'' As last year's winner and the favorite to win today, and as a survivor of late stage testicular cancer that had invaded his brain, Armstrong is the only person alive who could even seriously consider such a choice. As with any hero who has returned from somewhere dangerous, he has a story to tell. The third happy surprise (after almost four years of survival after diagnosis and victory in the Tour) is how good a story it is and how well the smooth, often elegant, writing of Sally Jenkins helps him tell it.</p>
        <p>Armstrong's new autobiography is called ''It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life'' (Putnam) and it ranks very high on the list of two genres of which I have read too much, the memoirs of sports stars and of cancer survivors. Tough, direct and filled with useful information about racing a bicycle, coping with cancer and even in vitro fertilization, the book also offers up a fascinating portrait of an insecure, fatherless momma's boy who is still in honest struggle to grow up and be a good father himself.</p>
        <p>His mother was 17 when Lance was born and his father left them when the boy was 2. Armstrong dismisses him as ''a non factor'' who merely ''provided the DNA.'' When a Texas newspaper traced his biological father last year, Armstrong not only expressed lack of interest in finally meeting him but called the man's expression of pride opportunistic. It is as if he is still trying to abandon the old man right back.</p>
        <p>Lance's stepfather, Terry Armstrong, is described as ''a Christian who used to beat me for silly things.'' That may help explain why Lance later describes himself as ''agnostic.''</p>
        <p>At 7, he was liberated by a Schwinn Mag Scrambler; ''a bike is freedom to roam, without rules and without adults.'' He was probably safer on the road. His favorite game, which he invented, was ''fireball.'' He and a friend, wearing garden gloves, played catch with tennis balls which they soaked in gasoline, then set aflame.</p>
        <p>The central character in the book is his mother, Linda, who worked several jobs as she put herself through school, and was his constant source of strength. She taught him to never quit. She moved them to upper middle-class Plano, Tex., for the schools, and then protected him from classism and the local epidemics of adolescent drug addiction, depression and suicide.</p>
        <p>No football player in a football-crazy town, Lance found his outlet in triathlons. In this lottery sports world, there is a tendency to overpraise those who do it the hard way, but often they have no choice. In biking, Lance admits, he found a way to inflict physical pain on himself that smothered the emotional pain.</p>
        <p>''Cycling is so hard,'' he says, ''the suffering is so intense, that it's absolutely cleansing.''</p>
        <p>He was a perfect candidate for chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>The precancerous Lance Armstrong was known as the Texas Bull, an aggressive, disrespectful rider fueled by the rage that covered his fears. He likes himself much better now. Unlike most cancer survivor/writers who profess moral improvement, his claim seems to be more than a way of finding something worthwhile in unspeakably bad luck.</p>
        <p>While he says that cancer made him a better person, more interestingly it made him a better racer. Before his months of chemo, he had been a star of one-day races. After chemo, he discovered his strength was in endurance for the long haul, which is what the 23-day, 2,274-mile Tour de France is all about. As well as life. Without cancer, he believes, he would not have won the Tour. Don't try this or fireball at home.</p>
        <p>The superstar and survivor genres come together in Armstrong's descriptions of the computers, blood tests, online research, emotional support and teamwork that goes into both bike racing and cancer treatment, as well as how he channeled his attacking race style into being an aggressive, noncompliant patient.</p>
        <p>Delicious small facts abound: I had no idea that he wore a heart monitor during the Tour so his coach in a chase car could tell him when to pedal harder or slow down. Or that EPO, the red-blood cell enhancer banned in the Tour, was a drug he had to take when chemo suppressed his immune system. He stopped taking EPO after his cancer treatment ended and has been on record as fiercely anti-drug.</p>
        <p>Rare among cancer survivors or superstar athletes these days, Armstrong does not offer that kind of cloying religious advice that fits on a T-shirt but not in the real world. What he does offer, however, is worth taping to your handlebars: ''We can take responsibility for ourselves and be brave.''</p>
