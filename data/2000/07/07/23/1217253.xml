        <p>Things are looking brighter, quite literally, for the Valhalla Union Free School District because of a $100,000 donation, the biggest the district has ever received.</p>
        <p>The money, which came from Spectrum Skanska, a local real estate development company, will help pay for new windows at the middle and high school campus on Columbus Avenue, where most of the windows are more than four decades old.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas Kelly, the school superintendent, said that without the money, the district would have had to lay off a teacher and increase class size.</p>
        <p>Spectrum, based in Valhalla, is building a 165-unit residential development in the district -- homes that Dr. Kelly observed would bring even more students into the school system.</p>
        <p>What made the Spectrum gift unusual, besides its size, was the fact that it came with no strings attached. Dr. Kelly said that until now, the largest gift to the system had been $40,000 and that gift, like most donations to the school, was restricted to a scholarship. He said no unrestricted gift had ever been more than four figures.</p>
