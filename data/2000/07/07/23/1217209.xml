        <p>There is a beloved figure in Viennese folklore named Dear Augustin, a musician who got so stupefied while pub-crawling during the 1681 plague that he was taken for dead and thrown in a ''pestilence pit.''</p>
        <p>He recovered the next day, climbed out and composed one of the 17th century's top hits, ''Oh, Dear Augustin, Everything's Gone,'' an ode to life in spite of setbacks.</p>
        <p>It is not a perfect simile for Jorg Haider, the Austrian politician who is feared because of past remarks that seemed to minimize Nazi crimes, but there are parallels. People write off the leader of the Freedom Party for one gaffe or another, and then he makes a comeback. Some are glad to see him, some are not -- but everyone is a little nervous about the company he has been keeping.</p>
        <p>His recent visits to Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, for example, have not helped matters. Nor has the possibly accidental use of an SS motto in a speech by a young leader in his party. Nor has Mr. Haider's suggestion that the leader of a rival party be indicted for treason for sipping Champagne with France's prime minister -- particularly when the new minister of justice, Mr. Haider's former personal lawyer, was beside him and agreed that the idea was worth exploring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider, whose party's entry into government was the reason the 14 other European Union members imposed sanctions on Austria in February, is technically not in power. He resigned as party leader; his only national government role is on an advisory council; and he remains merely governor of Carinthia Province.</p>
        <p>But he does not remain in obscurity. He is still the glue binding the Freedom Party, which he led from 5 percent of the vote in 1986 to 27 percent and a share of government last year.</p>
        <p>Political analysts say his coalition partners, the People's Party, think they have him where they want him: playing the game rather than spoiling it; sinking in opinion polls; and leading a party headed for a power struggle between him and one of his proteges, the 31-year-old finance minister.</p>
        <p>Skeptics like Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, foreign editor of Profil magazine, say it works the other way. Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel ''still has the illusion that he's domesticating Haider, while the fact is that Haider is Haiderizing the whole government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Everyone mentions one photo: Mr. Schussel recently visited Mr. Haider in Carinthia and took a ride in his new Porsche. Photographers caught their boyish grins, and caption writers noted gleefully that Mr. Haider was in the driver's seat. Mr. Schussel laughed it off, saying: ''As chancellor, I have several chauffeurs.''</p>
        <p>As Andreas Unterberger, editor of Die Presse, a center-right paper, puts it, their coalition is more ''a psychological game'' than political deal-cutting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider needs to be reassured that he is accepted rather than ostracized, Mr. Unterberger said.</p>
        <p>On domestic issues, it is hard to say Mr. Haider is driving. Most of his campaign promises have been ignored. He had backed a ban on immigration, a flat tax, $400 monthly checks for new mothers (to encourage larger families) and a crackdown on crime and child-molesting.</p>
        <p>Thanks to his campaigning, Austria had already tightened its borders, but it just allowed immigrants hoping for asylum to hold jobs legally. Crime and child-molesting were populist scare tactics, never a real problem. The flat tax and $400 check ideas have disappeared. In fact, the finance minister, Karl-Heinz Grasser, a Haider appointee, has proposed an austerity plan meant to balance the budget by 2003.</p>
        <p>Also, Austria, like Germany, recently agreed to pay reparations to Third Reich slave workers. Some years back, Mr. Haider criticized war reparations, saying tax money ''shouldn't go to Israel.''</p>
        <p>Since entering government, Mr. Haider's ''blue'' party has fallen in the polls -- as it had in the past, only to rebound at election time -- while Mr. Schussel's has risen. The Green Party too is up, while the Social Democratic reds, who finished first in the 1999 election with 33 percent of the vote but could not form a coalition, are stumbling; their leader, Victor Klima, just quit to become a Volkswagen executive in Argentina.</p>
        <p>But the outside world is watching only one issue: the European Union sanctions. They have done no economic damage, but they humiliate Austrians, up to 80 percent of whom oppose them in polls. ''We are treated like a colony,'' said Andreas Khol, No. 2 in the People's Party. ''France would never accept such treatment. Italy, never. Spain, never. Germany, maybe.''</p>
        <p>On this issue, Mr. Haider is very influential, but one could say he is merely driving only if ''driving'' is what goes on in ''Bullitt'' or ''Dukes of Hazzard.'' He careers.</p>
        <p>He demanded a referendum asking Austrians whether they wanted to use their veto to block all European Union actions until the sanctions were lifted. (In a recent poll, 70 percent favored the move.) He hinted that the veto could be used for only six months, until Sweden replaced France as the European president, since the French are seen as Austria's persecutors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khol, going along, drafted a carefully worded referendum proposal. It does not use the word ''veto,'' and he denies that it is a threat. It is, he says, a ''hint'' to government, ''a channeling of the wishes of the people who say we can't sit here like a lamb until we're slaughtered.''</p>
        <p>If the sanctions were dropped, he said, the referendum, planned for this fall, would be too.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Haider complicates all delicate diplomacy.</p>
        <p>He visited Libya in May as a guest of Colonel Qaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, a personal friend from a Vienna business school; he returned in June with a group of businesspeople and then announced that Libya would deposit $25 million in a bank owned by the Carinthian government. Colonel Qaddafi promptly criticized the sanctions as the European Union ''giving in to Zionist whims.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Khol declined to say whether Mr. Schussel had privately asked Mr. Haider to avoid such moments.</p>
        <p>In June, a new provincial leader in the Freedom Party used the phrase ''Unsere Ehre heisst Treue'' -- ''Our Honor Is Fidelity'' -- in a speech to party workers. He later denied knowing it was the motto of Hitler's SS troops, saying he was born after World War II. Mr. Haider, born in 1950 to parents who were once staunch Nazis, partly defended him, saying honor and fidelity were good principles.</p>
        <p>The party's Vienna leader, Hilmar Kabas, was heard to call President Thomas Klestil a ''lump,'' which means ''little honorless thief.'' He denied it, saying he must have said ''hump'' or ''dump,'' words that mean nothing in German.</p>
        <p>And several party members have coined a new word, ''Vernaderung,'' which seems to mean ''vandalism by a gnawing rodent,'' and they now apply it to Austrian politicians who act friendly with French officials, as Alfred Gusenbauer, the new leader of the Social Democrats, did, prompting Mr. Haider's suggestion that he be charged with treason.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider has also unleashed a spate of libel suits to silence critics.</p>
        <p>Suits for small amounts are a feature of Austrian political life, but they are now more intimidating, writers who have been sued say, because the lawyer who filed many of them, Dieter Bohmdorfer, is now the minister of justice. Also, conservative judges are finding in Mr. Haider's favor, making awards of $500 or more, plus legal costs.</p>
        <p>Libel suits here can be brought over statements that are clearly opinion, which they cannot under American law. Mr. Haider sued a major news magazine that pictured him with devil's horns on its cover and then a small leftist weekly that reprinted the picture with an article about the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>And, because espousing Nazi ideas is a crime, Mr. Haider sues those who link his ideas with Nazism. He sued a University of Innsbruck political science professor for saying on Italian television that his remark that concentration camps were really punishment camps ''trivialized Nazism.'' He won $5,000, then sued the professor again for a CNN interview in which he said Mr. Haider's comparison of immigrants and parasites used ''similar feelings and prejudices'' as those exhibited by Nazis. Mr. Haider denied using the word ''parasites'' specifically against foreigners. That suit is pending.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't put anyone out of business, but it's muzzling free expression,'' said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for the center-left daily Der Standard, who is the object of a suit.</p>
        <p>The hope of those being sued is that they will be able to turn the tables on Mr. Haider by appealing to the European Court of Human Rights, which is, coincidentally, in France. Its rulings give freer rein to political comment, Mr. Rauscher said, ''and the court says politicians have to endure more criticism than other people.''</p>
