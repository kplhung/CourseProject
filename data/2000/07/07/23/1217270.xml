        <p>Ever since ''E.R.'' became a runaway hit six years ago, networks have tried, with mixed success, to find the right prescription for another successful medical drama. This year, CBS's ''City of Angels,'' an inner-city hospital drama that is struggling in the ratings, will return for a second season while ABC's ''Wonderland,'' set in a mental hospital, was canceled shortly after its pilot was broadcast in March.</p>
        <p>Now Lifetime, the cable channel that labels itself ''television for women,'' enters the fray with an original hourlong series, ''Strong Medicine,'' which has its premiere tonight at 9.</p>
        <p>The show, starring Janine Turner and Rosa Blasi, focuses on two tenacious doctors with opposing views who are appointed to run a women's health clinic in Philadelphia. Ms. Turner, familiar to audiences as the quirky airplane pilot Maggie O'Connell in ''Northern Exposure,'' plays Dr. Dana Stowe, a starchy, Harvard-educated surgeon. Ms. Blasi, who starred in the Showtime film ''Noriega: God's Favorite,'' is Dr. Luisa Delgado, an outspoken, hands-on physician who runs a debt-ridden South Philly clinic. When the clinic is merged with the women's medical center at posh Rittenhouse Hospital, the discordant duo share a lively multicultural practice that allows the series to explore issues ranging from menopause to girl gangs.</p>

        <p>Ever since ''E.R.'' became a runaway hit six years ago, networks have tried, with mixed success, to find the right prescription for another successful medical drama. This year, CBS's ''City of Angels,'' an inner-city hospital drama that is struggling in the ratings, will return for a second season while ABC's ''Wonderland,'' set in a mental hospital, was canceled shortly after its pilot was broadcast in March.</p>
        <p>Now Lifetime, the cable channel that labels itself ''television for women,'' enters the fray with an original hourlong series, ''Strong Medicine,'' which has its premiere tonight at 9.</p>
        <p>The show, starring Janine Turner and Rosa Blasi, focuses on two tenacious doctors with opposing views who are appointed to run a women's health clinic in Philadelphia. Ms. Turner, familiar to audiences as the quirky airplane pilot Maggie O'Connell in ''Northern Exposure,'' plays Dr. Dana Stowe, a starchy, Harvard-educated surgeon. Ms. Blasi, who starred in the Showtime film ''Noriega: God's Favorite,'' is Dr. Luisa Delgado, an outspoken, hands-on physician who runs a debt-ridden South Philly clinic. When the clinic is merged with the women's medical center at posh Rittenhouse Hospital, the discordant duo share a lively multicultural practice that allows the series to explore issues ranging from menopause to girl gangs.</p>
        <p>''It's a medical drama from a woman's point of view,'' said Tammy Ader, the show's co-executive producer, in a telephone interview from the Los Angeles set where the series is being produced. ''Until recently, all of medicine was based on the 70-kilogram male. That's the same way television medical dramas have been. We decided to make ours about women -- the doctors, the patients and their stories that dramatize the advances and moral dilemmas that are taking place today.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ader, who was a producer on ''Sisters'' and ''Party of Five,'' created the series from a concept that originated with Whoopi Goldberg, who is the other executive producer. While awaiting the birth of her third grandchild, Ms. Goldberg was so fascinated by the goings-on in the maternity ward that she called her agent and suggested a series on women's medicine.</p>
        <p>''We want to deal with issues and not have to sugarcoat them,'' said Ms. Goldberg, who occasionally puts in an appearance on ''Strong Medicine'' as Dr. Lydia Emerson, an eminent women's health specialist. ''We don't want to touch on an issue and immediately segue into the relationship between the doctor and her boyfriend.''</p>
        <p>Indeed it seems there isn't a current controversial issue that ''Strong Medicine'' doesn't examine. Tonight's pilot finds the doctors tackling homelessness, child abuse, sexually transmitted disease and ovarian cancer. In a coming episode, a wealthy couple and the surrogate mother pregnant with their child want nothing to do with the baby when it is discovered that the fetus is brain-damaged.</p>
        <p>After each show, Lifetime plans to offer information and expert opinions about issues covered in the episode on a companion Web site.</p>
        <p>''It's a very important service to offer our viewers,'' said Carole Black, chief executive officer of Lifetime, which has produced documentaries on child care, breast health, AIDS and rape. ''We want them to have access to the most up-to-date, in-depth information.''</p>
        <p>However, Ms. Goldberg, who described ''Strong Medicine'' as a dramedy, shunned any emphasis on the series' educational aspect.</p>
        <p>''Don't mention the E word,'' she said with a laugh. ''Whenever you say, 'You might learn something from it,' people get really nervous. They think it won't be fun and interesting.''</p>
        <p>Rest assured it will be, insisted Ms. Ader. ''With Whoopi Goldberg associated with it, how could it not have humor?'' she said. ''It is character-driven, about people, not diseases. Luisa is a single mom with a demanding, stressful job. Dana is in her mid-30's, unmarried, a fertility specialist aware of the ticking clock. I think there are parts of each of these women that every woman can identify with.''</p>
        <p>Playing the patrician Dr. Stowe appealed to Ms. Turner because, she said, ''she is a strong, sensual, well-rounded character with a sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>''I felt she comes across a bit one-dimensional in the pilot, but in the following episodes you see her more relaxed, with more humor and yes, even a tiny bit of a quirky side,'' said Ms. Turner, who has relocated to Los Angeles with her 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Juliette, from their home in Texas for the duration of the series. (Lifetime has ordered 13 episodes.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Turner said she based her character on her own Dallas obstetrician-gynecologist. ''She wore red high heels into surgery when she delivered my baby,'' she said. ''Now I wear red high heels into surgery, too.''</p>
        <p>Naturally, both doctors will have their share of romantic entanglements, but those will be secondary to the plot, say the executive producers. In fact, it is the relationship between the medical odd couple that seems to ignite the most sparks.</p>
        <p>''The conflict between them brings a central energy to the show,'' said Ms. Ader. ''They both are so smart and have such good hearts, but they are so different that they bring you five sides to every story.''</p>
        <p>Helping the doctors navigate the sea of medical crises are colorful supporting characters, including Peter Riggs (Josh Coxx), the clinic's sexy nurse-midwife; Lana Hawkins (Jenifer Lewis), a motherly ex-streetwalker who is Dr. Delgado's receptionist; and Dr. Robert Jackson (Philip Casnoff), the smoothly political chief of staff at Rittenhouse Hospital .</p>
        <p>In keeping with the series' attempt to be rooted in reality rather than glossily manufactured Hollywood, the producers said, viewers won't see any terminally ill patients who look as if they have stepped off the cover of Health nor any infallible doctors.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that makes 'Strong Medicine' so interesting is that it shows you there aren't any clear-cut answers,'' said Ms. Black. ''It's not the type of series where everything is wrapped up in a nice bow at the end.''</p>
