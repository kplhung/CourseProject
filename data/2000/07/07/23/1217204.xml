        <p>Federal health officials have concluded that most nursing homes are understaffed to the point that patients may be endangered. For the first time, the government is recommending strict new rules that would require thousands of the homes to hire more nurses and health aides.</p>
        <p>In a report to Congress based on eight years of exhaustive research, the Clinton administration says that understaffing has contributed to an increase in the incidence of severe bedsores, malnutrition and abnormal weight loss among nursing home residents. Many of the patients end up hospitalized for life-threatening infections, dehydration, congestive heart failure and other problems that could probably have been prevented if the homes had more employees, the report says.</p>
        <p>Nursing homes with a low ratio of employees to patients are ''significantly more likely to have quality-of-care problems,'' the study says, and ''substantial increases'' in staff may be required to ensure that homes do not endanger the safety or health of patients. The 200,000-word report is to be sent to Congress this month.</p>
        <p>It recommends new federal standards to guarantee, for example, that patients receive an average of two hours of care each day from nurses' aides. It says that 54 percent of nursing homes fall below this ''proposed minimum standard.''</p>
        <p>The quality of care depends not only on the number of nurses' aides, the lowest-skilled workers, who help feed and bathe patients, but also on the number of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, who supervise the aides, the study says.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, the report says that nursing homes should have enough registered nurses to provide at least 12 minutes a day of care to each resident, on the average. But, it says, 31 percent of nursing homes do not meet that standard.</p>
        <p>The government emphasized that the proposed levels of staff were not the optimal levels, but the minimum needed to prevent patients from being exposed to ''a substantially increased risk'' of poor-quality care.</p>
        <p>The report, from the Department of Health and Human Services, was required by a 1990 law and was originally supposed to be completed by Jan. 1, 1992. But health officials experienced many delays, and the scope of the project grew as they conducted more research and analyzed huge amounts of data from nursing homes around the country.</p>
        <p>Federal researchers said they found that staffing levels were much higher at nonprofit nursing homes than at for-profit homes. Large nursing home chains that had financial trouble in the last two years, including chains that filed for protection under the bankruptcy law, have cut staff to control costs, the report said.</p>
        <p>The cuts come when nursing home residents are typically sicker than in the past, with more serious disabilities. Hospitals have reduced the length of stays, releasing patients ''quicker and sicker.'' Many people with less severe conditions, who might have gone to nursing homes 15 years ago, now receive care at home from visiting nurses and aides.</p>
        <p>Nursing homes said it was unrealistic for the government to specify minimum levels of staff when it was providing what they called inadequate payments under Medicaid and Medicare, the programs for low-income people and those who are elderly or disabled.</p>
        <p>In addition, nursing home executives said it was hard to attract and retain good workers in a booming economy, when the unemployment rate is at a 30-year low and other industries offer less demanding, better-paying jobs.</p>
        <p>The American Health Care Association, a trade group for the industry, said it could not support ''minimum staffing ratios'' unless the government agreed to help pay the additional cost, which could total several billion dollars a year.</p>
        <p>About 1.6 million people receive care in 17,000 nursing homes nationwide. Ninety-five percent of the homes participate in Medicaid or Medicare and are therefore subject to federal standards. But, the report says, the federal law and regulations are ''too vague'' to guarantee an adequate number of employees.</p>
        <p>The law, adopted in 1987, says nursing homes must have enough staff to provide services enabling each patient to achieve ''the highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being.'' Neither the law nor the rules indicate the minimum or appropriate numbers of employees.</p>
        <p>Congress could amend the law, or health officials could revise the rules to set more explicit standards.</p>
        <p>Nursing homes, like hospitals and other health care providers, are lobbying Congress to restore money cut from Medicare in 1997. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, said he would consider earmarking some of the money to ensure that nursing homes hired additional workers.</p>
        <p>''More than half of the nation's nursing homes don't meet a minimum benchmark for staffing,'' Mr. Grassley said. ''That means residents don't get fed enough. They don't get turned to prevent bedsores. They end up in the hospital much more often than they should.''</p>
        <p>The report found that nursing homes with low staffing levels tended to have large numbers of residents with nutrition problems. Many frail elderly patients need help with meals but do not receive it, and their health declines, the study said.</p>
        <p>When employees are in short supply, they often prod patients to eat faster, forcing ''huge spoonfuls of food into their mouths,'' so the patients cough and choke, the report said.</p>
        <p>Statistics compiled by the government show that 47 percent of nursing home residents need some assistance in eating, and 21 percent are totally dependent on assistance.</p>
        <p>To prevent severe bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers, patients must be turned or moved every two hours, the report said, but this is unlikely to occur in homes with low numbers of nurses' aides. The sores can become infected and damage underlying muscle and bone.</p>
        <p>The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said last year that more than one-fourth of nursing homes had deficiencies that ''caused actual harm to residents or placed them at risk of death or serious injury.''</p>
        <p>Charlene A. Harrington, a professor at the School of Nursing of the University of California in San Francisco, said, ''Medicare payments are calculated on the assumption that nursing homes will have certain levels of staff, but the government does not require homes to have the amount of staff they are paid for.''</p>
        <p>Nursing homes in Delaware, Maine, Alaska and Hawaii consistently have high ratios of employees to patients, the report said. Staffing levels are low in Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut fall in between.</p>
        <p>Medicaid pays for the care of 68 percent of nursing home residents. A 1980 law required that such payments be ''reasonable and adequate'' to cover the costs of ''efficiently and economically operated facilities.'' Many nursing homes invoked that law to get higher reimbursements. But in 1997, Congress repealed the law, at the behest of states, which share Medicaid costs with the federal government.</p>
        <p>The report said that repeal of the law had put downward pressure on nursing home payment rates in some states, like Oregon.</p>
        <p>Several nursing home chains have filed for bankruptcy protection in the last two years. They include Sun Healthcare, Vencor, Integrated Health Services and Mariner Post-Acute Network.</p>
        <p>In 1999, the Clinton administration gave inspectors new guidance on how to determine if a home had sufficient nursing staff to meet the residents' needs. But even with this guidance, the report said, there is ''no evidence'' that inspectors can actually determine whether homes comply with the general federal requirement to have sufficient staff.</p>
        <p>Inspectors are supposed to make unannounced visits to each nursing home at least once a year to assess compliance with federal standards. But, the report said, patients ''report a fear of retaliation from staff or other residents'' if they express concern about the staff, and employees ''have also voiced the fear of losing their jobs if they discuss staffing issues with the survey team.''</p>
