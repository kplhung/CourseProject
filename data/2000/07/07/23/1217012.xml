        <p>The White Plains Common Council has rejected two plans for development of a 121-acre parcel of land adjacent to downtown and owned by New York Presbyterian Hospital. The first plan, a request for rezoning, called for commercial and residential development over much of the open portions of the site in return for a donation of 60 acres to the city for use as a park. After the council rejected it 5-2 early Tuesday morning, they unanimously refused the hospital's second effort, a more modest plan for development that did not include a park. That move has prompted the hospital to consider a lawsuit which, according to city attorneys, the city is likely to lose.</p>
