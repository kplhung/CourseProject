        <p>RACING through the Alps in a teetering bus, cheering on packs of professional cyclists jockeying for position at 50 miles an hour, Gail Sonnenberg has one thing in mind: increasing sales at the United States Postal Service.</p>
        <p>As senior vice president of sales for the quasi-independent agency, Ms. Sonnenberg began overseeing its cycling-team sponsorship in 1997. That was just as Lance Armstrong emerged from his bout with cancer to join the squad -- whose uniforms are emblazoned with the Postal Service logo.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Sonnenberg, based in Arlington, Va., treks to races in this country and abroad, drumming up new business -- especially from the team's many other corporate backers. ''Like any other sponsorship, it's about building our brand,'' she said last week over the blare of loudspeakers announcing that the team still had the lead in the Tour de France, which ends today. ''This is not something we do because it feels good.''</p>
        <p>When the Postal Service landed the title sponsorship for the team in 1996, it hoped to grab international business away from competitors who operate overseas, where cycling is adored. But the team's success -- last year, it was the first American squad to win the Tour de France -- has also been a point of pride at the post office, a place historically short on morale.</p>
        <p>The tour gives Ms. Sonnenberg access to executives of other sponsors like Nike, Bike.com and Visa.</p>
        <p>In 1999, relationships with sponsors brought the post office $10 million, she said, more than offsetting the cost of being the team's title sponsor.</p>
        <p>After the victory last year, the Postal Service slapped its logo on biking paraphernalia and started selling it over the Internet. But that extra revenue may pale in comparison with the exposure that its best-known cyclist, Mr. Armstrong, brings to an otherwise banal brand.</p>
        <p>''It's like traveling with the Beatles,'' Ms. Sonnenberg said, referring to the crowds that encircle Mr. Armstrong at races. ''This was an awfully lucky venture for us.''</p>
