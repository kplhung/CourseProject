        <p>Gov. George W. Bush had an extensive face-to-face discussion about the vice presidency with former Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri early this week, according to several high-ranking Republican officials, and one of those Republicans said that Mr. Danforth was in a small group of people still in the running for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth ''is among those being considered,'' said one Republican official.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth emerged today as someone near the top of Mr. Bush's list a day after Republicans close to the Texas governor said that Richard B. Cheney, the former defense secretary, who is supervising the vice presidential selection process for Mr. Bush, was himself a leading contender for the job. One Republican close to Mr. Bush had described Mr. Cheney as the leading candidate at this point, and a high-ranking Republican official said today that Mr. Danforth's emergence did not change Mr. Cheney's status.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush is not expected to make a final decision until Sunday night, and Republicans close to the campaign, along with Mr. Bush's advisers, have cautioned that it is still impossible to predict with any certainty what Mr. Bush will do. High-ranking Republicans also said today that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Danforth might not be the only prospects that Mr. Bush was considering. Mr. Bush's aides have said that the governor would most likely announce his decision next week, probably no earlier than Tuesday. But the aides declined to indulge any speculation about whom Mr. Bush might choose.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Danforth, who retired from the Senate in 1994 after 18 years there, apparently withdrew himself from consideration, saying that he would prefer not to be offered the job. But his long meeting with Mr. Bush in a Chicago hotel on Tuesday, which was first reported by ABC News, suggested either that his resistance had softened or that he was leaving some room open to be persuaded to become the Texas governor's running mate if Mr. Bush asked him.</p>
        <p>Several knowledgeable Republicans said that Mr. Danforth's wife, Sally, was also present, and that Mr. Cheney, in his role as chief of the selection process, attended part of the meeting as well. Mr. Danforth was the only potential vice-presidential candidate, in addition to Mr. Cheney, with whom Mr. Bush has met over the last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth, 63, is a lawyer and an ordained Episcopal minister who recently oversaw an independent investigation into the federal government's actions during the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex. When he released his report on Friday, earlier than expected, he said that an ''unexpected political possibility'' had been presented to him in May and had motivated him to finish his work before other circumstances forced him to step down from the job.</p>
