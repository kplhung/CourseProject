        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The question ''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?'' has a simple answer: both. They were bullies because they were besieged. Twelve-tone music and its rationalist, ultra-complex allies were never popular in any way beyond a small circle of aficionados and wannabes. It was rarely programmed in mainstream concert venues, and recordings on the better-known record labels were rare. This was very disheartening and outrageous to its denizens, who consequently became more belligerent in their denunciations of the philistines who might not embrace what to them was a historical imperative. Charles Wuorinen and Pierre Boulez both said in different ways that any composer who didn't jump on the serialist bandwagon was simply irrelevant.</p>
        <p>Quite simply, if they acted like bullies it was because they were on the defensive. Yet as Anthony Tommasini points out, a minority can easily tyrannize.</p>

        <p>The question ''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?'' has a simple answer: both. They were bullies because they were besieged. Twelve-tone music and its rationalist, ultra-complex allies were never popular in any way beyond a small circle of aficionados and wannabes. It was rarely programmed in mainstream concert venues, and recordings on the better-known record labels were rare. This was very disheartening and outrageous to its denizens, who consequently became more belligerent in their denunciations of the philistines who might not embrace what to them was a historical imperative.

        <p>Quite simply, if they acted like bullies it was because they were on the defensive. Yet as Anthony Tommasini points out, a minority can easily tyrannize.</p>
        <p>We tend to attribute more prestige, power and ascendancy to academic-serialist styles of music than they deserve. If 12-tone writing was the acceptable way to be cutting edge in midcentury, it didn't last long. Its own elitism and supposed indifference to public approval -- indeed, according to some serialists, only other ''experts'' could really hear and appreciate what was going on in the music -- practically guaranteed an eventual obscurity.</p>
        <p>But we owe a great deal to this short-lived cerebral music, for it provided a dialectical situation wherein a return to tonality and pulse-centered rhythms in music could emerge. The so-called Minimal composers Reich, Riley and Glass, the new expressivists such as Adams, who followed, and the New Romantics, such as Del Tredici, all reflect, to a great degree, a backlash against serialism. It was the very rigidity, indeed, the rigor of serialism that helped bring forth an extreme reaction to it.</p>
        <p>One way of viewing serialism is to see it as a sort of giant affective device in the hermeneutics of modern music. In our postwar, anxiety-ridden culture we badly needed a music that would by itself be the affect to reflect our era's darker infelicities. When contemporary classical music lost its power to be affective in the midcentury, and some of our most talented composers wanted to create structures, forms, events, processes, which were unto themselves ''interesting'' without any external meaning, they found the perfect style in serialism. Of course the same could be said of Cagean indeterminacy, but that is just the flip side of hyper-organized music, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Now that serialism has waned we can see it for the rather significant mono-affective instrument it was and continues to be.</p>
