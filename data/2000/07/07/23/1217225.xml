        <p>Westchester County and parts of Connecticut are scheduled to be sprayed with pesticides to prevent outbreaks of the West Nile virus after tests showed that dead birds and mosquitoes were carrying the virus, county and state officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, the spraying was ordered after the State Health Department reported on Friday that it had found the virus in four dead birds, said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Health Department.</p>
        <p>The birds were found in Somers, Rye, Scarsdale and Purchase, Ms. Tolchin said. On Tuesday night, trucks are to spray a pesticide called Anvil within a two-mile radius of where the birds were found. If it rains or if there are not enough trucks to do the job, the spraying will be postponed, Ms. Tolchin said.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, nine mosquitoes found in Stamford on July 11 had the virus, said Michele Sullivan of Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection. Parts of Stamford, Darien and New Canaan are to be sprayed tomorrow from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. if it does not rain. The trucks will use a pesticide called resmethrin, Ms. Sullivan said.</p>
