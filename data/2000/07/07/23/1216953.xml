        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Griffiths's warm reception of Andrew Parrott's book on one-per-part Bach performance [''Cutting the Bach Choir Down to Size,'' June 25] should be gratifying to those who have long advocated this approach. Nonetheless, Mr. Griffiths may have (no doubt inadvertently) given his readers the impression that all of the ''exhaustive research'' supporting Mr. Parrott's conclusions was done by Mr. Parrott himself. In fact, as Mr. Parrott is careful to emphasize in his book, a great deal of this research has been done over the last two decades by the conductor and scholar Joshua Rifkin. Mr. Griffiths mentions the 1982 paper in which Mr. Rifkin first proposed the idea, but readers may not be aware of how extensively Mr. Rifkin has amplified and refined his initial arguments in numerous publications since then.</p>
