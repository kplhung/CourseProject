        <p>Brown-tide algae is at record levels in Great South Bay and has spread to Quantuck Bay in Southampton, a Suffolk County official said last week.</p>
        <p>The official, Walter Dawydiak, the acting chief the Health Department office of ecology, said counts over 1 million cells a milliliter were found in late June in Great South Bay.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Nuzzi, the chief of the county Health Department's marine resources bureau, said the bloom in Quantuck Bay had spread into Moriches and western Shinnecock bays. He said no cell counts were available.</p>
        <p>The readings in Great South Bay rival those found in Peconic Bay in 1985, when brown tide algae was first observed. The algae, whose cause is not known, has been blamed for decimating scallops in Peconic Bay and clams in the South Shore bays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawydiak said the Great South Bay bloom extended west of the Robert Moses Causeway, farther west than most past blooms had spread. He said that if the bloom persisted it would harm clams, which are unable to digest the algae. Profuse blooms also harm aquatic plants like eel grass by blocking sunlight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawydiak said the current bloom was unusual because it had persisted through last winter, though at far lower levels, before surging in April and May as waters warmed. The most profuse algal blooms occur in the spring and early summer.</p>
