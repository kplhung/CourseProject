        <p>Thank you for the interesting article ''Pollution Police, Armed With Flyrods'' on July 9. Trout Unlimited has an impressive record of protecting the watersheds, and the community owes them a vote of appreciation.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for the interesting article ''Pollution Police, Armed With Flyrods'' on July 9. Trout Unlimited has an impressive record of protecting the watersheds, and the community owes them a vote of appreciation.</p>
        <p>I was particularly interested in the focus on stormwater runoff. The League of Women Voters of Westchester recently released their two-year study of wastewater treatment in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>As a result of our findings, one oldie recommendation is for a countywide stormwater management plan possibly administered by a stormwater district.</p>
        <p>Because stormwater is the single largest source of water pollution nationwide, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has initiated a Stormwater Phase II Rule, effective in December 1999.</p>
        <p>This rule requires municipalities with populations over 10,000 to institute a stormwater management plan in order to qualify for a stormwater Spdes (State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System) permit to discharge stormwater into a waterbody.</p>
        <p>The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will issue compliance guidelines by 2002.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that implementation will not begin for at least two years, the League is recommending that the county begin now to adopt a stormwater management plan. Your  article emphasizes the need and urgency for this action.</p>
        <p>The article also mentions failing septic systems as a major source of pollution in the watershed. Septic systems provide effective treatment if properly sited, constructed and maintained.</p>
        <p>Westchester County has good regulations for siting and construction, but maintenance is the total responsibility of the property owner who has little or no knowledge of these systems.</p>
        <p>The League study recommends some type of oversight of septic systems which would include regular inspections and pumpouts as well as education of owners on proper care and maintenance.</p>
        <p>The League has launched a public education campaign on several issues of wastewater management. Your article contributes to public awareness of these issues. We are all responsible for our environment, and by working together we can achieve results.</p>
