        <p>ENRON, the Houston-based utility and energy giant, last week announced a 20-year agreement with Blockbuster  to deliver movies on demand into homes, as a digitized video stream over fiber optic lines, including the thousands of miles installed by Enron itself.</p>
        <p>Enron faces tough competition from the current pay-per-view offerings by companies like AT&amp;T and Time Warner. But Enron executives say the pay-per-view market is limited by inflexible show times and the inability to pause, stop or rewind.</p>

        <p>ENRON, the Houston-based utility and energy giant, last week announced a 20-year agreement with Blockbuster  to deliver movies on demand into homes, as a digitized video stream over fiber optic lines, including the thousands of miles installed by Enron itself.</p>
        <p>Enron faces tough competition from the current pay-per-view offerings by companies like AT&amp;T and Time Warner. But Enron executives say the pay-per-view market is limited by inflexible show times and the inability to pause, stop or rewind.</p>
        <p>Beginning this fall, Enron and Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom, expect to offer about 500 movies to homes with high-speed digital subscriber lines, or D.S.L.'s, and there are plans to expand to 7,000 movies and other entertainment.</p>
        <p>Enron's president and chief operating officer, Jeffrey Skilling, has helped guide the company as it has applied skills learned in marketing natural gas to the sale of electricity and, more recently, Internet bandwidth. He was interviewed by phone from Enron's headquarters in Houston. Following are excerpts.</p>
        <p>JULIE DUNN</p>
        <p>Q.  What areas will receive movies first and what will be the price?</p>
        <p>A.  We're going to look at where there are already good D.S.L. connections in place, look at Blockbuster's systems, and try to find a match. We expect to focus first on major metropolitan areas.</p>
        <p>They'll probably cost around $5. Blockbuster is going to be doing the work to figure out exact prices. It's essentially going to be an online VCR: you can control playback, rewind. You'll view the movies the same way as the videotape that you rented from a Blockbuster store.</p>
        <p>And once the mechanics are in place to stream video, any video signal can be streamed across the equipment: concerts, video games, anything.</p>
        <p>Q.  What if consumers would rather receive their movies over cable?</p>
        <p>A. We're the long-haul component of the network; we're really agnostic about the last-mile solution. We're the Interstate; once you get off, there are all sorts of local routes, like cable, that you can take.</p>
        <p>I see a very yin-and-yang relationship between cable and D.S.L. It's a nice fit.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there enough miles of fiber optic lines in place, with broad enough coverage, to make your plans practical?</p>
        <p>A.  14,000 miles. All of North America. Europe will be completed within the next month. The Pacific Rim early next year.</p>
        <p>In addition, we're also installing very sophisticated switching stations into other fiber networks. We will be able to distribute across any fiber to anywhere in the world.</p>
        <p>We've invested $600 million to date, but we're just starting a very aggressive program. Enron will be investing at least $600 million a year to build this network.</p>
        <p>Q.  Will sales and trading of Internet bandwidth ever become as smooth as for other commodities?</p>
        <p>A.  We're working with a number of players to develop standards. Once you have standards, you can start to define a commodity. You'll have set qualities, specs, a standard unit.</p>
        <p>We expect to see a market for bandwidth much like electricity and gas. We're already transacting in it;  we've made 75 standardized bandwidth transactions.</p>
        <p>This market is really starting to take off.</p>
        <p>Q. It's estimated that 4 percent of American households currently have D.S.L. capabilities. Most of your market so far has been corporate. How profitable has that been, and where do you see the market for household service heading?</p>
        <p>A.  We're really just in the process of installing, and it's mostly geared toward entertainment, video streaming. Once you have entertainment products coming over broadband, I would expect explosive growth of D.S.L. interconnections in the future.</p>
        <p>Up to this point, profits have been modest.  But you can imagine all the applications that are coming down the pipeline right now -- with the click of your mouse, having a person on your screen and actually interacting with them. Virtually no Web sites have this right now. I think one day all existing Web sites will have video.</p>
        <p>The problem with the current Internet infrastructure is that it's a rocky road. You really need to have this fiber network installed. That's what we're trying to do.</p>
