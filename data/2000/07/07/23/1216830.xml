      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>What is most striking about the celebrity portraits that Arnold Newman photographed for Life, Look and other magazines is their elegant simplicity. As shown in ARNOLD NEWMAN (Taschen, $39.99), the photographer has focused his camera primarily on artists, writers and political figures for the past 60 years. He usually captures his famous subjects with revealing backgrounds or telling compositions. A pensive Stravinsky is seated at a grand piano that dwarfs the composer as its raised lid resembles an abstract sculpture of a musical note. Poised on a sofa with wide stripes -- and matching wallpaper -- an amused Diana Vreeland makes her fashion statement with a robe that clashes, yet oddly complements the pattern. Robert Moses is depicted standing messianically on a steel beam suspended over the East River, with blueprints in hand and the Manhattan skyline as backdrop. As if to remind us that photography is, in a sense, painting with a newfangled brush, Newman had several artists pose with an easel or a blank canvas framing their heads, including Mondrian, de Chirico, Man Ray, Georgia O'Keeffe and Hans Hofmann. Recent photos of Woody Allen and President Clinton testify that Newman has lost none of his skill for apprehending an inner mood with an outer expression.</p>
