        <p>THEY could have been poster boys for the inevitability of globalization. In shapeless T-shirts, baggy pants and baseball caps turned backward, Gazza, Nehon, Zaion.e and Dr. Snot would have passed unnoticed at any American hip-hop gathering. Except this wasn't New York (or Los Angeles) but a small market town 30 miles south of Florence, better known for its 18th-century churches (one with a reliquary said to contain the sacred milk of the Virgin Mary) and its temples to consumerism (a Prada outlet) than for its breakbeats.</p>
        <p>They had come to take part in a three-day conference on hip-hop from the Italian diaspora, organized by Joseph Sciorra of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute at Queens College. Italian rappers and those of Italian origin from around the world met to discuss and debate the finer points of their art, their concerns and aspirations.</p>
        <p>Though the hip-hop community of Montevarchi and nearby Terranuova Bracciolini is tiny -- Dr. Snot (Beniamino Brogi), a 17-year-old local M.C., says it numbers about nine people -- the town was in many ways an ideal site for the conference. For Montevarchi is home to Libero Vietti, one of the few remaining poets of ottava rima, a 13th-century form in which stanzas have 8 lines of 11 syllables in a rhyme scheme of abababcc. Ottava rima is the standard form for epic and narrative verse in Italy (Boccaccio, Ludovico, Ariosto and Torquato Tasso) and has also been used in competitions. In its competitive form, in which two poets improvise verses selected by the public, some argue it is a sort of precursor of rap.</p>
        <p>''This is the land of the ottava rima, and this is something you should think about,'' Lorenzo Brusci, an organizer of the conference, told an audience of about 50 on the first day. ''It's a form that depends on rhythm and texts where you can go for hours improvising rhymes. Try to see how the technique works.''</p>
        <p>Ottava rima is a highly polished and structured form that, in its present version, sounds more like a modulated singsong than a rap. But the idea that a tradition with roots in medieval Tuscany relates to a genre rooted in modern New York throws into relief an essential element of Italian rap: as a re-examination of local oral traditions, it has revived the use of dialects in music. Indeed, Italy's vibrant hip-hop scene is less a confirmation of the supremacy of American exports than proof of the popularity of homegrown offerings.</p>
        <p>Since their earliest days in the 1970's, hip-hop culture and rap music have built up a global following. Today it is possible to turn on the radio just about anywhere in the world -- TransRap, the ''home of global hip-hop,'' provides information on the music in 167 countries on its Web site -- to hear Hindi rap, Japanese rap or Cherokee rap. There's even a hip-hop band, Nuuk Posse, which raps in Inuit.</p>
        <p>The earliest Italian rap, which developed throughout the 1980's, was for the most part a direct emulation of what was happening in the Bronx. ''Most of us, when we started, imitated Americans and we all rapped in English,'' acknowledged Ice One (Sebastiano Ruocco), one of the most respected Italian rappers and the producer of many hip-hop groups. ''Then came a sort of Italianese, an imitation of English, that modified the words. But then we became aware of our own language. And we began to understand Italian sounds.''</p>
        <p>The repudiation of English as rap's lingua franca began about 10 years ago as the mostly underground Italian hip-hop scene developed in distinct and isolated communities. In this context, it was natural for dialects, which had not been used in popular music for years, to be embraced in many areas, especially in the South. Nearly 50 percent of all Italians still speak in dialect, at least within the family, and the musicality of most dialects adapted well to the rhyme and cadence of rap.</p>
        <p>''We want to speak to young people, and rap is the most direct way of getting to them,'' said Polo (Alberto Cretara), the 28-year-old M.C. of La Famiglia, a Neapolitan hip-hop group. ''Neapolitan is what I speak every day, and I rap about everyday things. Our songs present our reality; we aren't trying to be American.''</p>
        <p>At first, Italian rappers mostly addressed contemporary social issues like the Mafia, government corruption (the rise of hip-hop coincided with the fall of the ruling party that had governed Italy for nearly 50 years), immigration, heroin addiction, homelessness and the high unemployment rates in the South. The militancy of the songs varied, finding hard-core spokesmen in the so-called ''centri sociali,'' political aggregations of squatters occupying derelict buildings throughout Italy. Hip-hop groups with battle-cry names like Assalti Frontali (Frontal Attack) and AK 47 dominated that scene, which competed with an even more underground movement that chose to follow a less political, more stylistic, path.</p>
        <p>But with few exceptions, the political activism has been short lived. Goffredo Plastino, who teaches ethno-musicology at the University of Bari, argues that the novelty of Italian hip-hop is that it has no ties to Italian musicality and the tradition of the canzone italiana (Italian song), whose mellifluous lyricism easily lends itself to love songs. He contends, however, that as Italian rap broadened its appeal to become increasingly profitable, social protest was progressively abandoned in favor of more conventional subjects, like love. It was an indication that even hip-hop cannot resist the intrusion of Italian melody.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that the Italian music industry pushes everyone in one direction until you get the same formula as the Italian song,'' Mr. Plastino said. ''As it becomes more Italian, rap will be finished.''</p>
        <p>Such a fate is unlikely as long as rappers continue to investigate their deeply rooted musical traditions. ''Italian rock, which dominated the 1970's and 80's, was an ugly copy of American rock,'' said Pierfrancesco Pacoda, a hip-hop producer and the author of two books on Italian rap. ''While in hip-hop, Italy rediscovered its own originality.''</p>
        <p>In the 1993 song ''Fight da Faida'' (''Fight the Feud''), Frankie Hi Nrg MC (Francesco di Gesu), one of the country's best-selling hip-hop artists, decried the Mafia's stranglehold over southern Italy. ''It's the eve of a revolution against the voice of the Godfather,'' he raps. ''But today Don Vito Corleone is much closer. He is seated in Parliament.'' The song ends with an 18th-century Sicilian filastrocca (nonsense rhyme) sung by Frankie's cousin, Vabbina La Bruna, whose quick-fire staccato delivery of the filastrocca easily fits with Frankie's rap.</p>
        <p>''I used to sing it with my friends when we were children,'' he said. ''Just listen to the meter, to the rhythm of the filastrocca; it sounds just like a rap. I learned it from my grandmother. It was the first rap I ever heard; I was 5.''</p>
        <p>SUD SOUND SYSTEM, a group from the Salentine peninsula in Apulia, plays a reggae-inflected rap hybrid known as ''tarantamuffin.'' It is a music that draws on an old local tradition in which musicians once performed songs to heal those who had been bitten by tranatulas. The rhythm of this healing music, also known as pizzica, passes like an undercurrent through the songs of the Sud Sound System.</p>
        <p>Sha-One (Paolo Romano), another of La Famiglia's M.C.'s, says his group has absorbed many elements of Neapolitan culture, in particular the songs of the musicians, known as posteggiatori, who traveled from town to town spreading different words and idioms. In the song ''Odyssey'' he mentions the siren Parthenope, whose name is linked to the mythological origins of Naples. ''I sing you this sonnet that is taken from the portrait of a goddess,'' he raps. ''You have to believe me Parthenope is more beautiful than Venus.''</p>
        <p>He also points to the animated gestures of the Neapolitan comic Toto (Antonio de Curtis), who died in 1967 but is still celebrated as the archetype of southern Italian comedy. ''Just watch an American rapper and how he moves onstage,'' he said, ''and tell me if he doesn't look Neapolitan.''</p>
        <p>The hip-hop scene in Montevarchi, as well as that of most of Tuscany, is perhaps less lively than that of Naples or the rest of Italy. Still, Tuscany is a natural cradle for rap, as competitions in ottava rim depend on the same skills of improvisation and verbal dexterity that mark a good rapper. Ottava rima competitions have taken place since the 18th century, and until the late 1970's there were few Tuscan town festivities that did not include them. The Italian actor Roberto Benigni mastered the technique as a teenager. Yet today the practice has almost disappeared and is being kept alive by a handful of poets like Mr. Vietti.</p>
        <p>In his red T-shirt and blue Nike baseball cap, Mr. Vietti, 74, could pass for a rapper (at least from the back), though he concedes that he knows little about the genre. He is more concerned with the disappearance of the ottava rima competitions, which he says is a result of rural flight and an increased dependence on television. Nonetheless, he says he would be more than willing to teach a youngster the tricks of his trade.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe that in the year 2000, there isn't someone from around here with the brains and the gift of nature needed to improvise,'' he said, shaking his head. ''They can rap, but I guess if a young person doesn't hear the ottava rima canto, they'll never learn to improvise it.''</p>
        <p>Gazza (Daniel Zaganelli), 17, an M.C. from Montevarchi, acknowledges that he has never seen an ottava rima competition. ''Sure, we shouldn't ignore our tradition,'' he said. ''It was a good thing that already existed here, but we're too young to know about it and, besides, it's different from what we do.''</p>
