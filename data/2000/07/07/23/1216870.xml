        <p>EVERY up-and-coming rock band knows how unpleasant it is to haul around vanloads of heavy equipment, but the Jayhawks' burden is worse than most. In addition to amplifiers, monitors and bulky instrument cases, the members have to deal with the daily grind of hoisting the massive chip they carry on their collective shoulders. Before a recent show at Maxwell's in Hoboken, N.J., Gary Louris, the lead singer, spoke about his motivation for making ''Smile,'' the Jayhawks' sixth and latest album. ''I think we feel like we don't get the respect or the attention we deserve,'' he said. ''I think we feel a little bit slighted on both ends, on the artistic and the commercial sides. For some reason we still feel like we want to prove something.''</p>
        <p>Discussing the band's relationship to the No Depression alternative country movement, a grass-roots network of musicians, fanzines and independent record companies, the bassist, Marc Perlman, said simply, ''We created it.'' He also reflected on the Jayhawks' notion of success and the fact that the band has yet to score a hit record despite years of trying. ''I wish we were huge rock stars, but we're not,'' he said. ''And the reason we're still together is because we're a great band. We've thought about breaking up plenty of times, and we've thought, what a waste. What a waste of all these songs we haven't recorded and these great records we could make.''</p>

        <p>EVERY up-and-coming rock band knows how unpleasant it is to haul around vanloads of heavy equipment, but the Jayhawks' burden is worse than most.

What a waste of all these songs we haven't recorded and these great records we could make.''</p>
        <p>Well, if the Jayhawks don't burnish their own reputation, who will? ''Smile'' really is one of the most beautifully ambitious rock records of the year, an exquisitely melodic and literate concept album about wanderlust and the distance people will go to run away from their problems. Though the Jayhawks built a fan base as a roots-rock outfit -- trying to balance ragged, Rolling Stones rhythms with the spare, meticulous lyricism of Hank Williams -- ''Smile'' is essentially an art record, with each instrument and word designed carefully and self-consciously to illustrate the central themes of displacement and loss of self. ''Wake up/ Put your shoes on,'' sings Mr. Louris in the opening cut, and the journey begins: throughout the album the main character trav els from state to state, from mountains to oceans, weathering failed relationships and an increased sense of alienation along the way. Pedal steel guitars brush up against space-age keyboards, suggesting an authenticity that's become diminished; high-lonesome harmonies and barroom piano evoke a rustic Americana, while drum loops and samples stake out a more high-tech landscape. ''Smile'' is the kind of album college term papers are written about; you could go batty connecting the dots, piecing together metaphors and reading into obtuse imagery. ''Take a breath of the northern air and rub those eyes,'' Mr. Louris sings in the title track. ''Genuflect beneath the starry skies.''</p>
        <p>''Smile'' aspires to be nothing less than a classic, the kind of album teenagers stumble upon and hold dear for the rest of their lives. It wants to join a club with Van Morrison's ''Astral Weeks,'' the Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds,'' Big Star's ''Sister Lovers'' and other rock-'n'-roll benchmarks of loneliness and disillusion from the 60's and early 70's. ''Smile'' is so retro in tone and scope it even feels like it should be on vinyl: you can imagine a thick gatefold sleeve, the dusty white outline of a circle impressed into the cover.</p>
        <p>There's just one problem. In this day and age, who's going to care? ''Smile'' has arrived at a time when the notion of the rock album as an art form that liberates and unites people is severely out of fashion. Rock 'n' roll itself has rarely been lower on the cultural radar in the 50 years since it began: teen pop, rap, Latin music and dance all have a stronger presence in the youth market. And the rock bands that do score big on the charts are generally singles-driven acts like Creed and Matchbox 20 that could not create a thoughtful album from beginning to end if their video budgets depended on it. Boomer icons are still doing great work: Neil Young's recent ''Silver and Gold'' is an intensely personal reflection on love and aging, while Joni Mitchell's ''Both Sides Now'' is a gorgeous reinterpretation of pop standards. But these albums barely made a dent in the mainstream consciousness.</p>
        <p>EVEN the rock press is no longer a bastion for adventurous work by underdog artists: magazines are too competitive, too anxious to draw in demographic eyeballs by touting the same hit artists heard on the radio and seen on MTV. Spin didn't review ''Smile''; Rolling Stone bashed it. And as Internet technology continues to advance, prepackaged albums are becoming obsolete anyway. Young people can make their own albums instantly by downloading music off the Web. They can program the cuts they want, in the order they want, from any time period or genre they want. Why do they need a bunch of old-fashioned, overthinking guitar geeks to do it for them?</p>
        <p>''Smile'' is probably destined to become a cult album, which is, after all, what ''Astral Weeks'' and ''Sister Lovers'' were. Its emotional sensibility is too fragile, its mood too precariously balanced between isolation and optimism, to appeal to any but that small -- and perhaps vanishing -- group of rock fans who turn to music not just for entertainment but for salvation. Unfortunately, hipster status is not what the Jayhawks are after. ''I would like to have an impact on music, and I guess you can do it in retrospect by influencing people,'' Mr. Louris said. ''I just think it would be fun to have a hit.''</p>
        <p>''Smile'' was produced by Bob Ezrin, who also produced ''The Wall'' -- that's right, the ''Wall'' -- and its soaring choruses and propulsive anthems are meant to reel in as many listeners as possible. ''I think we made a record that people other than ourselves and the music literati would like to listen to,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''It's accessible. But I don't think it's a dumb record -- it's not all horrible-sounding drum machines. It's a very musical record. It should be O.K. for music like this to be on the radio again, just like it was in the 60's and 70's.''</p>
        <p>IN their quest to make intelligent commercial music, the Jayhawks haven't always had the helping hand of the music industry. After releasing two independent albums in the late 80's, the band signed to American, a label run by the producer Rick Rubin (the Beastie Boys, Tom Petty). ''Hollywood Town Hall,'' released in 1992, set the stage for what the label thought would be a major commercial breakthrough, and American pumped huge amounts of money into promoting the next album, ''Tomorrow the Green Grass,'' in 1995. But that spring, Worth magazine and Entertainment Weekly both used the Jayhawks as an example of how the music business can crush nonhit artists; the articles detailed the nearly $1 million the band owed American and various managers, suggesting that no matter how many records it eventually sold, the musicians would never make money. ''We became poster children for label hell,'' Mr. Perlman said. Mr. Louris added: ''Major labels throw money at bands, and most bands don't recoup. That's typical. But for some reason we had these stories written about us. It became kind of a nightmare because people were so focused on it. It was almost like, 'Poor little Jayhawks.' And we were fine.''</p>
        <p>But if the system sometimes hurt the Jayhawks, the Jayhawks frequently hurt themselves. The cherished myth of the rock 'n' roll band as a tight, harmonious unit fending off the corrupting forces of the outside world doesn't hold true here. Late in 1995, the founder and co-lead singer, Mark Olsen, quit. ''He wanted to make records on his own terms, where he didn't have to deal with the hang-ups of being on a major label,'' Mr. Louris said. ''And I don't blame him.'' The band decided to continue without him and Mr. Louris took the helm, which offended some fans; they viewed Mr. Louris as a usurper. Meanwhile, ''Tomorrow the Green Grass'' didn't recoup its investment, and neither did the group's 1997 album, ''Sound of Lies.'' Then American ended its distribution deal with Warner Brothers, and the band was caught in limbo for months while a new deal was set up with Columbia. ''Are we badly in debt? Worse in debt? Yeah,'' said Mr. Perlman. ''An investment was made into this band, and financially it probably hasn't returned as much as people would like. But on the other hand we have a great reputation. I think Columbia's proud to have us on the label.''</p>
        <p>So everything's great now, right? Not quite. After recording ''Smile,'' the Jayhawks' keyboardist, Karen Grotberg, quit to raise a baby. Asked how many people have been Jayhawks during the band's 15-year career, Mr. Perlman furrowed his brow. ''Let's see, 7, 8, 9 -- 10,'' he said. ''No, 11. Eleven counting the fiddle player, who comes and goes.'' Drummers have been a particular problem. ''We've had trouble keeping drummers,'' he said. ''Or liking drummers.''</p>
        <p>And since we're on the subject of trauma, we can add that Mr. Louris separated from his wife during the making of ''Sound of Lies,'' which further darkened that album's mood. He's now remarried, with a 1-year-old. ''Smile,'' he says, is the band's way of brightening up. ''It's not like, 'Smile, everything's great and we're all happy and the world's a shiny little place,' '' Mr. Louris said. ''It's more like, we're all going through very big struggles, but we're not alone.''</p>
        <p>The Jayhawks are probably going to stay somewhat dysfunctional. It's their nature. ''We're obsessive,'' Mr. Louris said. ''Bob Ezrin said I'm an interesting combination of obsessiveness and indecision. Maybe that's what keeps me going. It's like doing a crossword puzzle -- I can't stop. Even if it takes me three or four days, I can't rest until I fill it all in.'' So he can't stop until he has a hit record? Until he's become a rock star and recouped that million dollars and then some? Maybe with a little attitude adjustment, Mr. Louris could accept the fact that he has made it, just on different terms than the ones he envisions. Sitting in Maxwell's dingy basement dressing room, Mr. Louris lit a strong Canadian cigarette and glanced at his surroundings. The decor consisted of a single wooden bench, plywood walls and floor-to-ceiling graffiti. Around the corner, his bandmates hung out in an overheated storage area waiting for the show to begin. ''Yep, we made it,'' he said with a dry chuckle. ''Top of the heap. El numero uno.''</p>
