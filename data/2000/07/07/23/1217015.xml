        <p>Workers at two Yonkers hospitals have ratified their first contract since unionizing late last year. The new contract for workers at St. John's Riverside and Yonkers General Hospitals will boost salaries to levels comparable with hospital workers in New York City, said Michael Rifkin, the chief negotiator for Local 1199 Service Employees International Union. Close to 1,000 technical, clerical and nonprofessional workers as well as registered nurses will also receive full benefits. The salary of the lowest-paid workers will increase by two-thirds and high-end workers will receive five 3 percent increases during the next four years. The contract will expire in October 2004. The union continues to negotiate a contract with St. Joseph's Medical Center.</p>
