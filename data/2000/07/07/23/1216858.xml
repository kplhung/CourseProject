        <p>Sara Mosle notes that of the 4,000 people who inquire about volunteering for my organization each year, about 600 become involved in sustained, one-on-one relationships with needy youths. However, she neglected to say that this statistic refers to just one of our many programs. An ever-growing number of New York corporations, for instance, give time off every other week during the workday to some 600 additional people to meet with needy youths one on one, often at their firms.</p>
