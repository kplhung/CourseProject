        <p>WITH a list of film and theater credits as a writer and a director that stretches back to the 1940's, 83-year-old Arthur Laurents has a career that is still going strong.</p>
        <p>As part of a quartet of collaborators, along with Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Bernstein and Jerome Robbins, he redefined musical theater in the 50's with the back-to-back successes of ''West Side Story'' and ''Gypsy.'' His credits as a screenwriter include such films as ''The Way We Were'' and Alfred Hitchcock's ''Rope.''</p>
        <p>In the midst of having several new plays about to open, Mr. Laurents's memoir, ''Original Story By,'' published by Knopf, is going into its fourth printing. The account of an extraordinary life is a lucid, frank story that also touches on the McCarthy-era witch hunts. In addition, it covers Mr. Laurents's later adventures in the screenwriting trade, which include his battles with Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford over the political message of his original story for ''The Way We Were,'' and his life in Quogue, where he has lived since 1954.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Laurents also has a place in Greenwich Village, he lives most of the year in Quogue, which he referred to as ''the Hampton that time forgot.'' The rest of the Hamptons, he said, ''has been invaded,'' which is why he ''hasn't been in East Hampton in 10 years.''</p>
        <p>Where he lives in Quogue is rich in East End literary history. A barn that he once owned was used by the poet Frank O'Hara for his writing.</p>
        <p>Having worked for so long as a playwright, a screenwriter and a director, Mr. Laurents was hesitant to write his autobiography. But a friend, the playwright Larry Kramer, helped him find a way to bring the project to life. Mr. Laurents, who hadn't written prose, said Mr. Kramer advised him, ''Just think of the book as the longest monologue you've ever written.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurents talked about how things have both changed and remained the same for screenwriters since he first went to Hollywood 50 years ago. ''The writer gets more money,'' he said, ''but you're still the low man on the totem pole and you're treated basically with no respect.'' In the theater, Mr. Laurents said, ''the writer's position is lower than it's ever been; the theater is a director's theater now.''</p>
        <p>On the subject of Hollywood directors, Mr. Laurents said, ''Most directors are frustrated writers.''</p>
        <p>Detailed in his book is Mr. Laurents's unpleasant experience working on the 70's blockbuster ''The Way We Were.'' The very personal story was written by Mr. Laurents and directed by Sydney Pollack; it starred Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford. Early on, Mr. Pollack and Mr. Redford developed different ideas of what direction the story should take. The left-leaning political ideology of the story was watered down and 11 screenwriters were brought into the project. Finally, Mr. Laurents was brought back to repair the damage.</p>
        <p>''That was painful,'' he said of working on the movie. ''At least I learned something from it. It really hurt. I was the only person who had gone through the witch hunt, the only person who really knew the politics of that period.''</p>
        <p>Even at a time -- the early 70's -- when America's politics were leaning toward the left, Hollywood moviemakers were not truly politically committed, Mr. Laurents said. ''Their politics never really go very deep; they're very superficial,'' he said. ''They weren't thinking of the politics; they were thinking of the love story.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurents said Ms. Streisand fought to keep the political nature of the story intact. ''She fought, as she should have, for her character and for what her character was saying,'' he said. ''Her character was saying what I felt politically.''</p>
        <p>In his memoir he details his disdain for those who informed on their friends during hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He still feels that Elia Kazan was ''the greatest director of theater there ever was,'' but because he informed on his friends he ''is a despicable human being.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laurents ''understands, but doesn't condone'' those who named names to keep food on the table, but he is still angry about those he felt informed solely because ''they wanted to work in movies'' even though they had thriving stage careers.</p>
        <p>This fall Mr. Laurents's play, ''Two Lives,'' will open at Manhattan's Lincoln Center, while his play, ''Big Potato,'' will inaugurate the Duke Theater on 42nd Street. A third play, ''Jolson Sings Again,'' will star Patti LuPone.</p>
        <p>On July 29, Mr. Laurents will be honored at an East End benefit for S.A.G.E. On July 30, an event called ''American Musical Theater presents The Musicals of Arthur Laurents'' will take place at Guild Hall in East Hampton.</p>
