        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>So many have been quick to accuse Roger Clemens of purposely hitting Mike Piazza in the head with a pitch. The accusers defend their logic by saying Clemens is an intimidator. Yes, Clemens pitches inside, which increases his chances of hitting a batter, but it also increases his chances of getting a batter out.</p>
        <p>Pitching inside is his modus operandi for success, but he does not have a history of hitting batters in the head. If that pitch had not hit Piazza in the head, but had hit him in the thigh, or had simply flown out of control to the backstop, nothing would have been said. Clemens is guilty of an error that happened to have near tragic results. Must we accuse him of more than that?</p>

        <p>In his career, Piazza has 7 hits in 12 at-bats against Clemens, including 3 home runs, 1 double and 9 runs batted in. Given this history, would one expect Clemens to abandon his method of pitching inside? Of course not. Clemens was exercising his skills to the maximum of his ability. A baseball pitcher does not win five Cy Young awards by being tentative.</p>
