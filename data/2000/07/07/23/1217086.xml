        <p>MIDTOWN  Civil Rights Heroes Inspiring Today's Students</p>
        <p>Sixteen civil rights activists, most of whom live in New York, will be celebrated in an exhibition of historical and contemporary photographic portraits, graphic time lines, poetry and prose prepared in part by New York City public school students. The exhibition, ''The Long Walk to Freedom: Portraits of Civil Rights Activists Then and Now'' explores how ''ordinary'' people from varying racial and economic backgrounds came to accomplish extraordinary deeds through grass-roots organizing and sheer dedication.</p>
        <p>The show is organized by Community Works, an organization that provides arts education programs to New York City public school students. Students from the Computer School on the West Side of Manhattan interviewed the 16 subjects for this exhibition. Sherifa Godfrey, one student participant, said: '' 'The Long Walk to Freedom' has changed my life. I now choose to do things that I never thought were possible.''</p>
