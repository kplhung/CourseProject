        <p>While agonizing over whether to challenge President Lyndon Johnson in 1968, Robert Kennedy was advised by a friend to stay out of the race but to demand an antiwar plank in the Democratic platform. R.F.K. scoffed, ''When was the last time millions of people rallied behind a plank?''</p>
        <p>When Franklin Roosevelt pushed through the New Deal, he flagrantly ignored his 1932 Democratic platform, which pledged a balanced budget and smaller government.</p>
        <p>''All platforms are meaningless,'' said Theodore White, the presidential campaign chronicler. ''The program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate.''</p>
        <p>Party platforms have long been seen as pro forma documents, dutifully listing the party's stance on any number of issues. But, in fact, as the first details of the 2000 Republican and Democratic pronunciamentos emerge, we should remember that the platform can provide spectacular insight into a candidate's character: his vision, his shortcomings and, in many cases, his potential to win.</p>
        <p>For instance, the opportunistic approach of Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Republican presidential nominee, to his party's platform exposed crucial weaknesses that would almost certainly have flawed a Willkie presidency.</p>
        <p>After the Philadelphia convention, Willkie felt he had no choice but to endorse a plank denouncing President Roosevelt for seeking to drag the nation into war -- even though he generally agreed with the president.</p>
        <p>By October, Willkie, desperate for victory, was throwing his arm around die-hard isolationists like Charles Lindbergh and Col. Robert R. McCormick, the publisher of The Chicago Tribune.</p>
        <p>Many of Willkie's original internationalist champions felt betrayed. The publisher Henry Luce carped that his man should have ''told the truth and gone down, with greater honor, in a far greater defeat.''</p>
        <p>In 1960, the same appearance of cynical capitulation weakened the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon. Nelson Rockefeller, the mahatma of the then potent Northeast wing, demanded that his party reject President Dwight Eisenhower's wish to limit defense spending and to go slow on civil rights.</p>
        <p>Nixon thought Rockefeller was committing blackmail, but played ball. Without informing his staff, Nixon met Rockefeller at the governor's Fifth Avenue apartment and caved in to his chief platform demands.</p>
        <p>Nixon should indeed have been aggressive about civil rights, but not merely to avoid a floor fight. In the end, Nixon's deal only deepened the fractures in the party. In Chicago, Nixon found, as he later wrote, that ''angry and rebellious'' delegates thought he should have given Rockefeller the ''back of my hand.''</p>
        <p>Eisenhower, was furious when he heard about the ''treaty of Fifth Avenue,'' and threatened to sit on his hands that fall. Barry Goldwater denounced Nixon's secret pact as the ''Munich of the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>Just as platforms can undo a candidate, they can also give him a solid rocket-fuel boost. In 1980, Ronald Reagan used his Republican platform to pledge, in unmistakable terms, to cut taxes, deficits and the size of government, and to try for victory against the Soviet Union. Mr. Reagan's supporters that November included not only conservatives who felt exuberantly certain that he would fight for their agenda, but others impressed by his specificity and boldness.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Bill Clinton used the Democratic platform to etch what he called his ''profile.'' His ''New Covenant'' borrowed from ancient Republican platforms, exalting small government, the middle class and free markets. The manifesto did much to establish the nominee as what his aides called a ''different kind of Democrat'' from the Mondales and Dukakises.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, the Clinton platform is startling in its accurate forecast of programs like welfare reform and trade expansion that have proven hallmarks of the Clinton presidency.</p>
        <p>It would be marvelous to see both George W. Bush and Al Gore follow the Reagan and Clinton examples. But they may not find that easy.</p>
        <p>As a political heir, Al Gore would be hard pressed to produce a platform that matched Mr. Clinton's in sweep and novelty. His draft platform's most surprising element is the number of positions that dart to the left of the Clinton administration. For example, the 1992 platform emphasized the wonder of world trade; the 2000 draft emphasizes protecting American jobs.</p>
        <p>Pundits have chalked this up to Mr. Gore's need to lasso disgruntled liberals threatening to vote for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate. This fall's campaign should show us whether Mr. Gore's evolution was an act of political positioning or conscience.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush's draft platform will almost certainly try to placate the Republican right while reaching out to disaffected moderates. Just as Mr. Clinton borrowed from earlier Republicans, Mr. Bush may find himself consulting the president's 1992 playbook for hints on how to move the Republican image toward the center.</p>
        <p>But Governor Bush can find an even more irresistible model in his own family history. When Eisenhower ran for re-election in 1956, he asked his platform committee chairman to engineer a centrist document. Ike wanted to banish the memory of the hard-right platform of 1952, demanded by his rival, Robert Taft, which had embarrassed him. Eisenhower also wished to counter what he privately considered to be the troglodyte Republican leaders of Congress.</p>
        <p>Ike did not call his doctrine ''compassionate conservatism.'' He called it ''modern Republicanism.'' But the idea was roughly the same. The platform chairman Eisenhower put on the case was his frequent golfing partner, the senator from Connecticut and the grandfather of this year's presidential nominee: Prescott Bush.</p>
