      <block class="full_text">
        <p>NOW'S the time to do it,'' Bea Arthur said from her home in Los Angeles. Whatever it is remains to be seen: Is it cabaret? Is it theater? Is it a one-woman show?</p>
        <p>''I can tell you more about what it's not than about what it is,'' Ms. Arthur went on, except that she started and stopped with just one disclaimer: ''It is absolutely not autobiographical.''</p>
        <p>But then it is not a one-woman show either. Equal billing goes to Billy Goldenberg, Ms. Arthur's accompanist and musical director. ''We fashioned this thing between us,'' she said, adding, ''He's my everything in this case.''</p>
        <p>It may be utterly beside the point to categorize what Ms. Arthur and Mr. Goldenberg will be up to on the stage of Lucille Lortel's White Barn Theater in Westport on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Ms. Arthur said that she intends to tell a few funny anecdotes: ''well, they strike me as funny,'' she said, ''and there will be lots of songs -- good stuff we love.''</p>
        <p>Among his numerous composing credits, Mr. Goldenberg wrote the score for ''Ballroom,'' from which Ms. Arthur is to perform the show's highlight number ''Fifty Percent.''</p>
        <p>To theatergoers for whom the pause that withers is forever associated with Ms. Arthur, the chance to welcome back a star presumed lost to television is to be seized. A telephone conversation with Ms. Arthur turned into remembrances of theater times past and considerations of present possibilities for a star in her 70's.</p>
        <p>And it became increasingly clear that what Ms. Arthur means when she talks of ''the time to do it'' is ''to get back on stage.'' Not that she's been away since ''Maude,'' which grew out of ''All in the Family,'' and ''Golden Girls.'' It's just that her live performances have been confined to California: Anne Meara's ''After-Play'' at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1997 and before that, Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna's ''Bermuda Avenue Triangle'' in West Hollywood.</p>
        <p>No musicals there, unless you add a concert performance of the Gershwins' ''Strike Up the Band'' in Chicago. She pointed out that it had elegance, one of the things absent in musical theater nowadays, she reiterated.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Ms. Arthur recalled such classy intimate 1950's Broadway theater as ''An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May,'' for whom Mr. Goldenberg wrote the background music.</p>
        <p>It is something of an anomaly that Ms. Arthur -- who once said she had ''a voice like a tuba''; now she  changes the simile to ''more like a trombone'' -- is so indelibly linked to musical theater though she has not performed in many musicals.</p>
        <p>Yet after Marc Blitzstein's reinterpretation of ''Three Penny Opera,'' with Ms. Arthur as Lucy Brown, there was no escape. For that historic 1954 production coincided with the beginnings of Off Broadway. It also happened to be Ms. Arthur's introduction to Lucille Lortel, who took over that production after a season, and kept it running for years and years at what is now her namesake theater in Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>And so Ms. Arthur went to to the White Barn in 1996 for a one-night tribute to Kurt Weill. She performed Lucy's big number, ''Barbara's Song.'' She was a sensation. She returned in 1998 for a tribute to the Gershwins. And now for it.</p>
        <p>Whatever it is, if the Weill evening was a teaser, watch out Westport, here's Bea (who will be doing ''Some People'' from ''Gypsy'') and her friend Billy. ''Well, we'll see what happens,'' Ms. Arthur said.</p>
        <p>A musical evening with Bea Arthur and Billy Goldenberg, White Barn Theater, 452 Newtown Turnpike, Westport. (203) 227-3768. Performances at 8 p.m. on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday.</p>
