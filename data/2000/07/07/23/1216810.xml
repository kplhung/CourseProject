        <p>PURGATORIO</p>
        <p>By Dante Alighieri.</p>
        <p>Translated by W. S. Merwin.</p>
        <p>359 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $30.</p>
        <p>There's more to Dante than hell, but you'd never guess it from his backlist. In your local superstore you'll find in print nearly 50 books -- translations, critical studies, commentaries, school notes -- devoted to the ''Inferno,'' the first part of the three-part masterpiece that, because of its upward, hopeful momentum, the Florentine statesman-poet referred to simply as ''La Commedia.'' (It didn't become ''Divina'' until the 18th century.) Yet there aren't even half as many volumes about ''Purgatorio,'' the second part, which is now available in a new translation, together with the original Italian, by the poet W. S. Merwin.</p>
        <p>It's easy to see why. Each section of the ''Commedia,'' which tracks Dante's wide-eyed tour through the three realms of the afterlife -- hell, purgatory and paradise -- provides thoughtful, morally rigorous investigations of sin, guilt and redemption; each section is deeply emotional yet intellectually subtle; and each bears witness to dazzling imaginative and artistic resources. But only ''Inferno'' offers the kind of eye-popping gross-outs -- the pan-seared popes, hollowed-out heretics, cannibalistic counts, elaborately morphing monsters -- that audiences haven't been able to get enough of at least since the 14th century. (Chaucer, in ''The Friar's Tale,'' was already citing ''the wise poet of Florence'' as an authority on hell.) You read ''Inferno'' for the same reason you know you're going to shell out another nine bucks to see the next ''Scream'' movie -- there's something irresistible, if not wholly edifying, about testing your threshold for terror. In the terrific introduction to her 1949 Penguin Classics verse translation of the ''Commedia'' (still the liveliest and most thorough preparation for reading the poem), the novelist Dorothy L. Sayers -- yes, she of Lord Peter Wimsey fame -- sniffs at people whose knowledge of Dante is limited to skimming through the circles of hell ''in the hope of finding something to be shocked at.'' But who among us doesn't go skimming for shocks every now and then?</p>
        <p>The pleasures, on the other hand, of ''Purgatorio'' -- in which Dante and his protective guide, the dead Roman poet Virgil, tour the mountain where souls destined for salvation first purge themselves of sin by means of hard punishments -- seem less viscerally satisfying and have found a narrower audience. With its emphases on charity rather than hatred, and joy (anticipated joy, at any rate) rather than pain; its elaborate theological allegories, including a climactic procession in the Garden of Eden that would put the producers of ''Gladiator'' to shame; its crisp didactic passages illuminating pertinent theological issues, particularly the all-important role of free will in man's moral life; and its pervasive references to music, poetry and the visual arts, ''Purgatorio'' seems a bit Merchant-Ivory when compared with the Ridley Scott-ish milieu of ''Inferno.'' Its appeal is art-house, not multiplex. The lopsided emphasis on ''Inferno'' undoubtedly helps account for the odd fact that Dante had nearly half a millennium to verify the accuracy of his description of the afterlife before anyone got around to translating the whole of the ''Commedia'' into English: he died in 1321, but the first full English translation -- and a bad one at that -- didn't appear until 1802.</p>
        <p>Yet if the seductions of ''Purgatorio'' are subtler, it is a more moving work. Of the three canticles that make up the ''Commedia,'' it's the one that offers the most recognizably human emotions -- as befitting the only part to take place on earth. (In Dante's geography, purgatory is a mountain in the Southern Hemisphere formed from the earth that was displaced when Satan plunged down from heaven and hollowed out the pit of hell; and Dante's purgatory is, in fact, organized as a kind of inverse of his hell, rising in gradually narrowing tiers from a terrace where pride, the worst of the seven sins, is punished, to one reserved for the lustful. At the summit is the earthly paradise -- the Garden of Eden -- where Dante re-encounters his beloved Beatrice.) Yes, the elaborately symbolic religious allegory will keep sending you to the back of the book to check the notes, and, no, you won't get to see people grimly, eternally eating their own children here, but ''Purgatorio'' is a ravishing poem, filled with things that ''Inferno'' doesn't -- can't -- provide. Color, for one; this poem's many loving descriptions of the sky (''the tender color of Oriental sapphire,'' ''the white and vermilion cheeks / of lovely Dawn'') and the entire vast array of heavenly bodies make you realize, if you hadn't before, that there is no sky in hell. And in ''Purgatorio'' there is ceaseless music, and even laughter.</p>
        <p>Above all, ''Purgatorio'' is an intensely, sometimes unbearably, emotional work, because, like life, it inextricably and unpredictably twines together wildly disparate feelings: pain but also hope (something that ''Inferno'' notoriously admonishes all who enter it to abandon); confusion and illumination; torturous anticipation but also dizzying realization. At the end of the poem, after the poet has made his way up the winding Mount of Purgatory, observing the fittingness of the hardships gladly endured by souls working their way toward heaven (the proud must carry heavy stones; the envious have their eyes sewn shut), and reached the Garden of Eden, he finally gets to see again his dead muse, Beatrice. It is one of the great climaxes in world literature.</p>
        <p>In the foreword to his new translation, Merwin, a distinguished poet who over a long career has been responsible for nearly 20 translations from at least six other tongues, writes feelingly of his 30-year obsession with the poem. And indeed, the flaws as well as the virtues of his new rendering may be said to stem from a profound reverence for the original. In Merwin's translation you can lose the forest for the trees; he often finds an exact equivalent for each Italian word in a given passage, without, however, conveying the overall color, rhythm and even sense. He reproduces rather than reconfigures, and the result is verse that is frequently stilted and sometimes incomprehensible.</p>
        <p>There have been other distinguished and popular translations in the past 50 years: Sayers's (which, despite a certain starchiness, has sold over a million and a half copies since it appeared); John Ciardi's in 1961, C. H. Sisson's in 1980 and Allen Mandelbaum's in 1982. Mandelbaum, whose translation of the entire ''Commedia'' is frequently used in universities and has wide circulation as a Bantam paperback, is Merwin's real competitor -- the one the new translation is going to have to dislodge if it's to become a standard. Mandelbaum's version feels like poetry -- it has the same strong iambic beat that Dante's does -- and his lines have great rhythmic vigor and clarity. The latter is especially important because the components of Dante's vast project (what the Dante scholar Giuseppe Mazzotta has called an ''aesthetic theology of the totality of history'') are often complex and learned, and need to be unpacked for today's reader.</p>
        <p>Clarity also appears to be Merwin's laudable aim throughout. The first thing he does, like Mandelbaum, in order to achieve it is to forgo any serious attempt at reproducing Dante's distinctive rhyme scheme, the pattern known as terza rima, which produces a gentle but insistent forward momentum by rhyming every other line while grouping the lines in threes; because the second line of each triplet rhymes with the first line of the next, the rhymes pull you along, like surf creeping up a beach. Like Mandelbaum, Merwin offers occasional rhymes, both strict and loose, but since these tend to occur in paired couplets (''feet/beat,'' ''metal/portal'') the point of Dante's rhymes is essentially lost; the attempts at rhyme here aren't consistent enough to constitute an important formal element of the new translation.</p>
        <p>Freed from the constraints of rhyme, and not overly committed to reproducing the Italian's insistent meter either -- there are some really unrhythmic lines here -- Merwin has the opportunity to render Dante's Italian with greater precision, and throughout he appears interested in establishing a more faithful word-to-word correspondence than is evident in Mandelbaum. (Merwin often mimics the Italian word order and, occasionally, even the punctuation.) But the admirable desire to be more faithful to his original, rare in someone who is himself a fine poet, does not always work to advantage.</p>
        <p>A few small examples will have to suffice to show how characterization and clarity sometimes suffer here as a result of the translator's ostensible literalness. In Canto V, while he's visiting those dead souls who are atoning for having waited until the last minute to repent, Dante encounters Buonconte da Montefeltro, who was killed in battle. In one of those tiny, almost offhand moments of vivid private emotion that distinguish the ''Purgatorio,'' Buonconte feels ashamed, in front of the other dead souls, that his still-living relatives don't mourn him. Merwin's ''I go among these with my face down'' is graceless, and the emotion falls flat; it may reproduce io vo tra costor con bassa fronte more literally than Mandelbaum's ''among these shades I go in sadness'' does, but the latter gets the emotional and situational reality (and the rhythm) more vividly. Worse, Merwin's pervasive rendering of the Italian word duca, constantly used by Dante of his companion Virgil, as ''leader'' is a serious misstep: ''leader'' is too cold, too impersonal, and doesn't have nearly the emotional resonances that Mandelbaum's gentler ''guide'' does. What Mandelbaum's reader gets, and Merwin's doesn't, is the emotional quality of Dante's relationship to the figure who has been his affectionate, solicitous companion since the beginning of ''Inferno.'' Leaders you follow; guides you trust.</p>
        <p>Merwin's occasional tendency to transcribe rather than translate can be particularly damaging in the substantive passages that convey the heart of Dante's moral and theological vision. In a critical discussion that comes, not accidentally, at the center of the poem (in the 16th of 33 cantos), a rather mysterious character called Marco Lombardo discourses on the meaning of free will, on which the poet places supreme importance. (Dante often has such sympathy for the victims of post-mortem torments -- think of him fainting after his interview with Francesca da Rimini in ''Inferno'' -- that it's easy to forget his stern insistence that we always have the power to resist our baser inclinations: even if every desire we have ''rises from necessity,'' he admonishes us, ''within you is the power to restrain it.'') Here is Merwin's rendition of Marco's speech:</p>
        <p>The heavens set you going in your motions;</p>
        <p>not in all of them, I mean, but if I did</p>
        <p>you are given a light to know evil from good,</p>
        <p>and free will which, if it can endure,</p>
        <p>without weakening, the first bout with fixed Heaven,</p>
        <p>if well nourished, conquers all it meets later.</p>
        <p>This is virtually incoherent. Compare Mandelbaum:</p>
        <p>The heavens set your appetites in motion --</p>
        <p>not all your appetites, but even if</p>
        <p>that were the case, you have received both light</p>
        <p>on good and evil, and free will, which though</p>
        <p>it struggle in its first wars with the heavens,</p>
        <p>then conquers all, if it has been well nurtured.</p>
        <p>Mandelbaum is more fluent and makes sense. ''Set you going in your motions'' looks closer to Dante's</p>
        <p>i vostri movimenti inizia, but gives little if any sense that he is talking about the appetitive ''movements'' of the soul, the predilections that can lead to sin; ''appetites'' is far better in this particular case. And the second of the two stanzas is in Merwin tortured in the extreme. There is little point in trying to approximate the Italian word order and punctuation (as Merwin does here) if to do so obscures the sense of a critical moment in the poem.</p>
        <p>But Merwin's exactitude often serves the poem well. His poet's ear for the way things ought to sound is evident in many telling touches. Buonconte, for instance, is saved from perdition by the solitary tear he sheds while muttering a dying prayer; Dante's pathos-filled lagrimetta, with its charmingly miniaturizing t's, is better replicated by Merwin's staccato ''little tear'' than by Mandelbaum's ''just one tear.'' Even better, Merwin's faithfulness often allows you to see the poem's underlying structural elements -- its bones, as it were. In Canto XXX, Dante reaches the earthly paradise and hears the voice of Beatrice; in his rapturous excitement, he turns to Virgil. But Virgil has disappeared, no longer necessary now that Dante and his lady are reunited. It's a moment of terrible poignancy: a climactic attainment that is also a climactic loss. Three times an incredulous Dante utters the name of Virgil; two stanzas later, the voice of Beatrice herself responds, pointedly admonishing him three times -- one for each of his pathetic laments for his friend -- not to weep (piangere). Merwin scrupulously gives you all three Virgilio's and all three piangere's; Mandelbaum gives the Virgils but not the weeping, and the symmetry -- and effect -- is irretrievably marred.</p>
        <p>All the more ironic, then, that Merwin weakens the next scene -- the poem's great climax -- in a self-conscious departure from the Italian. Ten lines after he hears her voice, Dante finally lays eyes on Beatrice. (Cunningly, the poet presents himself as hearing her before he actually sees her.) The ''Commedia'' is set on Easter weekend, 1300 -- 10 years after the death of the young woman born as Bice Portinari, whom, as he writes in ''La Vita Nuova,'' Dante had loved since he first saw her when they were 8. His entire writing life was devoted to her, and the emotional power of his connection to her transformed him as a man, a thinker and particularly as a poet: he took that stale convention of the Proven--&gt;al troubadors, the aloof ladylove, and turned it into a philosophical and metaphysical device of inestimable power and authority.</p>
        <p>So line 73 of Canto XXX of the ''Purgatorio'' is an epiphany. ''Look at me well!'' Beatrice declares to an astonished Dante (who goes on to faint). ''Oh yes, it's me, it's me -- Beatrice!'' In the Italian (Guardaci ben! Ben sem, ben sem Beatrice) that's all one compact, triumphant and -- when you think about it -- slightly off-putting line. Far from being the shrinking Pre-Raphaelite violet you may have been expecting, Beatrice is an opinionated, fiery Italian donna who may dwell on a celestial pedestal but has her feet solidly on the ground: part Christina Rossetti, part Carmela Soprano. (When, later, she interrupts her lecture to demand of the dumbstruck Dante, Che pense? it has the impatient, foot-tapping, hands-on-hips force of ''What on earth are you thinking?'' and not Merwin's bland ''What do you think?'': she's scolding, not asking if he agrees.) Inexplicably, Merwin breaks up this line, displacing the name Beatrice from its climactic end position in the original to the beginning of a subsequent line. The result feels hamstrung and anticlimactic: ''Look at me well; for I am, I am certainly / Beatrice.'' She isn't ''certainly''; she's Beatrice. Here, for once, you wish the translator had been as literal as he so often is elsewhere.</p>
        <p>And yet it is with great and successful fidelity that Merwin concludes. In the final canto, Dante (after a stern lecture by Beatrice, who reproaches him for occasionally forgetting about her since she died) prepares to ascend to the heavenly paradise, having drunk from the restorative waters of the river Enoe, which renew him ''in the way that trees are new, / made new again, when their leaves are new.'' It is with this triple, incantatory repetition of the word ''new'' -- one that Merwin laudably captures -- that the poem concludes. This ending reminds us that while the inhuman thrills and otherworldly terrors of Dante's hell may appall and perversely gratify, only the richly human emotions to which ''Purgatorio'' gives us access -- joyous anticipation; the odd, slightly disappointing concreteness of long-awaited fulfillments; the strangely undramatic sadness that goes with pivotal separations; inexhaustible hope; and, above all, love -- refresh our sense of our own humanity. That much, at least, hasn't changed in 700 years. In an age that provides more and more opportunities to enjoy blockbuster thrills and to behold dazzlingly real-looking terrors, the fewer and fewer occasions we get to experience authentic human feelings anew are not to be wasted. Despite its shortcomings, Merwin's new ''Purgatorio'' is one such occasion, and we should be grateful for it.</p>
