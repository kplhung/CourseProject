        <p>REAL estate investment trusts have played yin of late to the technology sector's yang.</p>
        <p>When the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index has risen, shares of REIT's have generally fallen, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>But some analysts and money managers suggest that investors look to certain REIT's as technology plays in and of themselves. They point to the growing number of  REIT's that are either actively investing in technology to improve their businesses, or that cater to the real estate needs of e-commerce companies, which often require huge distribution facilities.</p>
        <p>And some analysts recommend that investors also keep tabs on those REIT's that are busy rolling out new high-speed, high-bandwidth telecommunications and Internet services for their tenants. These companies, they say, are poised to benefit from the federal REIT Modernization Act of 1999, which, when it takes effect in January, will allow REIT's to widely offer nontraditional services like  landscaping, parcel delivery, concierge services and telecommunications -- to their own tenants as well as to other parties.</p>
        <p>REIT's are now allowed to generate only 5 percent of revenue from such ancillary services. The new law is ''probably the biggest development in the REIT industry since 1986, when REIT's were permitted to both own and manage real estate,'' said Anthony R. Davis, an analyst at UBS Warburg.</p>
        <p>Still, some experts say investors may be getting carried away if they think that the REIT sector will furnish the world's next Cisco Systems. Arthur J. Hurley, portfolio manager for the SSGA/Tuckerman Active REIT fund, said technology, at least in the near term, would benefit REIT's mostly by allowing them to operate more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hurley pointed to AvalonBay Communities of Alexandria, Va., an apartment REIT that is already using an Internet-based system for leasing and managing its properties. ''It's not too early to look for technology plays in this industry, but it's too early to look for revenue streams,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, as REIT's keep focusing on owning or managing real estate, Mr. Davis said, only 4 to 5 cents a share in funds from operations typically come from ancillary services.</p>
        <p>But that's for now. He said income from ancillary services would grow at least 20 to 40 percent annually over the next four to five years.</p>
        <p>Jay P. Leupp, a managing director at FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, said the industry's overall technology investments might account for 10 to 20 percent of its revenue by the end of 2002. While bullish on the technological promise of REIT's, Mr. Leupp urged investors to scrutinize the managers of REIT's that are moving into new service areas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis agreed. ''The mistake that some REIT's will make is to go too fast and too much, and lose sight of their core businesses, so it all boils down to management, '' he said.</p>
        <p>In the industrial real estate market, Mr. Leupp says two early leaders are ProLogis Trust of Aurora, Colo., and AMB Property of San Francisco, which is already building large distribution facilities for electronic commerce companies like the Webvan Group, the online grocer. As for office REIT's, he says he thinks the leader in that market is Equity Office Properties Trust of Chicago, which is aggressively rolling out high-tech telecommunication services to its office tenants. Mr. Leupp also likes Spieker Properties of Menlo Park, Calif., which owns and manages both office and industrial space.</p>
        <p>AMONG shopping-center REIT's, Mr. Leupp likes Pan Pacific Retail Properties, an operator of strip centers that is based in Vista, Calif. He says it has invested in a service that lets shoppers do online comparison-shopping among tenants of the company's shopping centers.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Davis say the Simon Property Group of Indianapolis is the technology leader among REIT's that are focused on malls. They cite the 50 percent stake that Simon holds in MerchantWired, a high-speed communications network that will provide retailers with services like the ability to authorize a credit card purchase in less than  two seconds.</p>
