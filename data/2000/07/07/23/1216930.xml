        <p>THE trains haven't stopped at the depot in Water Mill for decades, but the crowds continue to come. The charming, converted country station has been a dining destination for the last 16 years.</p>
        <p>At first, when it called itself the Station at Water Mill, the restaurant served typical Hamptons fare. Later, owners gave the food a French spin and changed the name to the Station Bistro. Last summer, the word bistro was dropped and the food morphed into Mediterranean with dishes from Morocco, Italy and France.</p>
        <p>This summer brought new ownership: Dean Golden, who at one time was proprietor of Fresno Place in East Hampton and Sen and Harbor Rose in Sag Harbor and still owns the Wild Rose Cafe in Bridgehampton. He has retained Tim Smith, who was the chef at the Station Bistro since 1996, and made him a partner in the new venture. The food is called American fusion, which translates to local ingredients like North Fork duck and Montauk monkfish with international accents (e.g., lemongrass and scallion crabcakes with ginger, and lobster and yucca samosas).</p>
        <p>The quaint station house once had a casual country air with decorative plates, small pictures and plants tucked into corner cupboards. An old-fashioned ceiling fan whirled overhead. Mr. Golden has brought in a sleek, sophisticated, very Hamptons look. Dove gray walls are dotted with original art. Lamps and a Thai wood sculpture rest in the corner niches. The beautiful domed ceiling has a peachy glow, illuminated by a large satin-glass chandelier. Sturdy Mission-style chairs complete the elegant decor.</p>
        <p>Even more appealing on soft summer nights is the enclosed porch, where windows are flung open to cool breezes. From here, diners have a good view of the adjacent 1930's vintage Long Island Rail Road club-car bar.</p>
        <p>Service is a stripe above the East End norm. The hostess is personable; her actions more than perfunctory. Instead of just asking if everything is O.K., she answers her own question by saying, ''You need more butter.'' Our waitress was from the same mold: knowledgeable and quick to meet our needs. One evening, she was busy with another table when the runner delivering entrees arrived. The young man looked vague and was about to ask, ''Who gets the steak?'' when the waitress rushed over and reminded him of their numbering system.</p>
        <p>A bowl of tiny black olives and a paper cone filled with cheese straws and slices of superior bread make a positive first impression. Ingredients like lemongrass, ginger, soy and coconut milk give notice that the Thai wood carvings are indicative of more than a decorator's whim.</p>
        <p>One of the best openers is the lemongrass and scallion crabcakes flavored with ginger and made crunchy by a sesame crust. Just as appealing are three jumbo, lime-marinated, grilled shrimp set over a cold cashew soba noodle salad with chopped scallions and mango.</p>
        <p>Other appetizers that pack a punch are the seared marinated tuna paired with a ginger-macadamia pesto and a garnish of shredded vegetables sparked by sesame oil, and a chilled asparagus soup with a topknot of crunchy, deep-fried spinach. Both salads sampled also satisfied: arugula, endive, matchsticks of pear, Roquefort and walnuts, and a mound of field greens crowned with julienned jicama and grilled crottin cheese.</p>
        <p>Less pleasing were mussels steamed in a bland corn-tomato-sweet chili sauce and an overly sour scallop and shrimp ceviche marred by gritty scallops.</p>
        <p>A headliner entree of three gorgeous queen sea scallops with a luscious coconut milk-chili paste sauce suffered from the same sandy malady. One minute a diner was eating happily; the next moment it sounded like she was crunching Rice Krispies.</p>
        <p>Still, most entrees deliver 100 percent of the time. Fish to try are the perfectly grilled swordfish with mint-touched mango salsa, the grilled salmon with its teriyaki glaze and crisp yucca cake, the coriander-crusted tuna escorted by braised bok choy and a wasabi-soy beurre blanc, and the flaky sea bass over a chayote-roast corn succotash. The best of the three meat selections is the rosy rack of lamb with port wine glaze.</p>
        <p>All the desserts ring the bell. The two scoops of dense chocolate mousse in a pool of creme anglaise are first rate. Also drawing raves were a moist and tangy lemon Bavarian cake, a satiny mango creme brulee and an apple tart tatin spiked with ginger.</p>
        <p>Station Road  50 Station Road, Water Mill, (631) 726-3016.</p>
