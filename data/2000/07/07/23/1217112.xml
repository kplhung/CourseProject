        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Mexican Party Reported to Quash Polls Predicting Its Defeat'' (news article, July 17) may leave the impression that our polling for Francisco Labastida, the candidate of the Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, failed to predict his loss in Mexico's recent presidential election.</p>
        <p>You say our polling showed Mr. Labastida ''with a sweeping lead.'' While our polling in March, more than three months before the election, did show him with a double-digit lead, both of the final two polls we publicly released, on May 11 and June 22, showed that the race had tightened, giving Mr. Labastida only a four-point lead, within the margin of sampling error.</p>

        <p>We consistently advised the candidate, his advisers and the press that undecided voters would break overwhelmingly against the PRI. We warned that a dead heat among decided voters would mean a loss for Mr. Labastida as undecided voters chose change. Neither Mr. Labastida nor his advisers lacked data and analysis accurately predicting the outcome.</p>
