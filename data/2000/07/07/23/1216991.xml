        <p>ONE of the wonders of art is that viewers can be magic-carpeted into other cultures. Two such experiences are at hand these days at the Art Museum of Princeton University. One, an excursion into long-ago Mayan culture, might not look like much of a trip at first. It's too bumpy. Yet after seeing the potential held by the sole object in it, a piece of limestone carved in low relief, a viewer realizes that more than an excursion -- an edifying journey -- is possible.</p>
        <p>Situated in a room against blood-red walls is a piece of carved limestone called the Hauberg Stela, after John Hauberg, a Princeton alumnus who has promised it to the museum. The sculpture's importance lies in its early date, 197 A.D. The date can be known precisely because the Mayans were especially keen astronomers and recorded dates on their public works. The stela, which in Mayan was called a ''stone tree,'' was probably set up in front of a temple or entrance to a city to proclaim the events of a ruler's reign.</p>
        <p>With every exhibition of a didactic sort, the Princeton museum provides detailed explanations often with charts or other keys. Here viewers learn how to read a Mayan inscription, albeit in a rudimentary way. The show fosters collegiality, for, at their level, experts in pre-Columbian art cannot nail down meanings precisely either. That's one of the pleasures of the field, according to the assistant curator of pre-Columbian art, Matthew Robb, who organized the exhibition. Not everything is known; it's still wide open.</p>
        <p>Dominating the face of the stela is the image of the king, Bak T'ul, whose name means Bone Rabbit, in elaborate regalia and probably wearing the mask of the maize god. His headdress has a headband depicting the jester god. Any humor is lost on the contemporary viewer: according to Mr. Robb, Bak T'ul is in the act of blood-letting, a necessary part of the ritual of becoming king.</p>
        <p>Around the standing king are small, somewhat impish, figures shinnying up or descending an angular branch-like form. It is the vision serpent brought forth from the sacrifice. The troupe are probably figures in the Mayan zodiac who, by their array, confirm Bak T'ul as the center of the universe.</p>
        <p>But what might bring most satisfaction to viewers is a stack of 12 nugget-size images to the left of the king that form a short Mayan paragraph. Mr. Robb has laid out the grammar: the seventh image from the top is the verb, bloodletting, represented by a lancet, or two-sided surgical knife made of obsidian. The subject, Bak T'ul, is represented by a combination bone and rabbit skull. For emphasis a prepositional phrase reads ''of bloodletting.'' The first six images establish the date, 52 days before his accession to the throne, on which the king performed the self-sacrifice.</p>
        <p>One ramification of the exhibition, intentional or not, is that viewers are easily lured to the museum's lower galleries, which house antiquities from Latin America, Asia and the Mediterranean. Here can be found pre-Columbian objects that are contemporary with the Hauberg stela, including the Princeton Vessel, an alabaster cup on which is drawn a complex narrative that is not unlike a comic strip. The most alluring character here is a rabbit who serves as a scribe to the king -- though one suspects him of other sly functions.</p>
        <p>It seems odd to call these second-century objects pre-Columbian, since Columbus's arrival was not even close to being on the radar screen. A more compelling reverie is gained from glancing around at the objects from other cultures that share the galleries with the Mayan works. Small sculptures from Rome are nearly contemporary with early Mayan pieces, and they are much more familiar than the terra cotta pieces from the Americas. But in terms of liveliness and interest, the clay sculptures certainly hold their own.</p>
        <p>The other special exhibition in the lower galleries is low-key and seems to have been insinuated into the middle of the permanent displays of ancient objects. ''Flora and Fauna in Chinese Painting'' is the kind of easy-on-the-eye show that is the perfect follow-up to something as intensely cerebral and elusive as the Mayan one.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is meant to show that animals and plants have traditionally served in Chinese art as metaphors for a range of sensations: friendship, success after strife or even the mood of a chilly morning. One of the most unforgettable objects is a scroll that is sparse in imagery except for a fat and happy black cat rendered in ink. What this animal might stand for is open to question, but absolute contentment would be a good guess.</p>
        <p>Since most of the works are paintings or ink drawings on various kinds of paper, some faded compositions on wood hold special interest. They seem to have been designed to wear away, but like many advertisements on old barns, they are still here.</p>
