        <p>A SHORT section of the Appalachian Trail near Falls Village in northwestern Connecticut is being reshaped so handicapped hikers, including people in wheelchairs, can use the trail. It will be the only section graded for the disabled along the entire 2,135-mile footpath between Georgia and Maine.</p>
        <p>The new trail manages to combine a low grade with great views -- two qualities that often don't coincide on the Appalachian Trail. Hikers usually bumble over boulders, streams, and up steep inclines on much of the trail. But this new section maintains an average grade of 8.3 percent with a maximum of 14 percent. The new trail, at 48 inches wide, also is about twice as big as most of the Appalachian Trail.</p>

        <p>A SHORT section of the Appalachian Trail near Falls Village in northwestern Connecticut is being reshaped so handicapped hikers, including people in wheelchairs, can use the trail. It will be the only section graded for the disabled along the entire 2,135-mile footpath between Georgia and Maine.</p>
        <p>The new trail manages to combine a low grade with great views -- two qualities that often don't coincide on the Appalachian Trail. Hikers usually bumble over boulders, streams, and up steep inclines on much of the trail. But this new section maintains an average grade of 8.3 percent with a maximum of 14 percent. The new trail, at 48 inches wide, also is about twice as big as most of the Appalachian Trail.</p>
        <p>''To the best of my knowledge, it's the first handicapped-accessible section on a National Scenic Trail,'' said Ann Sherwood, chairwoman of the Connecticut Appalachian Mountain Club's trails committee.</p>
        <p>And it may not be the last. The federal government is working on how to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act in the back country and has formed an advisory committee to create a plan. That committee worked for two years on standards -- not yet adopted -- of hiking trails for the disabled. Its suggestions, released last July, include that new trails, where possible, be at least 36 inches wide and have inclines of no more than 12.5 percent.</p>
        <p>If the suggestions become law, sections of the Appalachian Trail could be subject to them, though the group that maintains the trail said most of it is too rustic to fall within the act. David Startzell, executive director of the Appalachian Trail Conference in Harper's Ferry, W.Va., who sat on the advisory committee, said the meetings were intense, because members struggled to set standards for accessibility on trails whose appeal is inaccessibility.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that there's going to be a whole lot of sections of the trail where it is not going to be feasible or practical to meet these standards, but on the other hand there are sections, and I suspect sections in every state, where we can meet them or at least meet the spirit of them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The idea to redo part of the Falls River trail came several years ago to Richard Blake, a retired teacher from Milford, when he was patrolling land owned by the National Park Service near Falls Village. As the volunteer overseer of about 7,000 acres adjacent to the trail, Mr. Blake knows that region very well.</p>
        <p>Near the banks of the Housatonic River, Mr. Blake scrutinized an overgrown horse racetrack that was part of a fairground in the early 20th century. Long ago, the forest grew up over it, but he could see that the oval still was level. It also was located near a road and parking lot.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Blake asked the Connecticut chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club, which is responsible for maintaining the Appalachian Trail in the state, to help build a 1.1-mile loop. The club liked the idea.</p>
        <p>After more than a year of planning and fund-raising, the work began. This winter and spring, a contractor and volunteer team graded and marked the trail. They widened and flattened a section of the Appalachian Trail, and they blazed and graded a new side loop, part of which is on the old horse track. Those who don't want to walk the full loop can take the cut-through section that shortens the trek to 3,215 feet. The group said the trail is smooth and wide enough for people in wheelchairs.</p>
        <p>The new trail section is less than a mile south of the Great Falls that gave Falls Village its name. Down river from the falls, which are the overflow for Connecticut Light &amp; Power's hydro-electric plant, the fast current of the Housatonic glitters below the even grade of the trail.</p>
        <p>Considering only materials and equipment necessary, building a trail like this costs about 10 times what a typical back-country route costs.</p>
        <p>The Falls Village loop cost about $45,000 for surfacing materials, rental of heavy equipment, and coordinators of volunteer work crews. The donors include the Connecticut chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club, the Boston headquarters of the club, the club's Chapters Committee, the Appalachian Trail Conference of Harper's Ferry, W.Va., the Fields Pond Foundation, the J. Walton Bissell, Foundation, and an anonymous person.</p>
        <p>Those donating time and services included Peter Jensen, a trail designer from Massachusetts, and volunteer trail workers.</p>
        <p>In early May, 17 employees of the BHC Company, a water company in Bridgeport, spent their annual community work project clearing trees and debris near what will be a rest stop on the new trail. The workers removed dirt and old debris that had covered over a stone dam and sluiceway that dates to the 18th-century industrial period of Falls Village.</p>
        <p>''They're a tough bunch,'' Mr. Blake said, as he leaned on the rake he was using to sift out old transformer covers. ''They know how to work.''</p>
        <p>Hikers will be able to look down on the old dam from two wooden benches above. Mr. Blake said he noticed the stonework on one of his many scouting trips. He didn't find any old photos, but he did enough research to realize someone had built a large dam.</p>
        <p>Down at the bottom of what would have been the sluiceway, water company workers, in matching T-shirts, pulled out rocks and chunks of old transformer covers in this spot that probably was a dump for an electric utility company years ago. On top of the dam above, Paul Fife and his son lifted up heavy rocks and loads of dirt with their excavator and bucket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fife, who runs a landscaping service in Falls Village, is one of the few paid workers on this project. He graded much of the pathway and laid down process gravel on top. He, Mr. Blake, and a retired investment manager, Ted Cowels of Canton, also raised the level of a wooden footbridge near the trail's beginning.</p>
        <p>''This was a day off for me,'' said Michael Dokla, a pipeline inspector for BHC who spent much of the morning lifting giant boulders and old insulators. ''I've been very busy the last two weeks, on the east side of Bridgeport, putting in water mains.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Startzell of the Appalachian Trail Conference said the trail maintaining clubs that keep the the Appalachian Trail in working shape are curious to see how the Falls Village accessible loop will hold up, and how many handicapped people will take advantage of it. One of the big unknowns has been: what sort of demand is there in the disabled community for these sorts of experiences? Some people think it is significant, others not.</p>
        <p>The Falls Village site could answer that question, he said, because it is relatively close to populated areas and has a parking lot.</p>
        <p>''It seems to have everything going for it,'' he said.</p>
