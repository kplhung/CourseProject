      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE tenor saxophonist David S. Ware has a sound so mighty it can put the fear of God into people hearing him for the first time. He is an old-school free-jazz preacher, ordained in the church of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. A fierce and seemingly inexhaustible improviser, he favors gnarled, guttural utterances that slowly build into shattering crescendos. It's as if he were fighting against the limits of his instrument to evoke the throes of spiritual ecstasy. He's not especially subtle, but he gets his message across efficiently and at a volume where it cannot be ignored.</p>
        <p>That message is grand and gloomy, and to some ears, faintly oppressive. The music surrounds you with solemnity the way a Renaissance cathedral does, and your first reaction might be to resist all its sweaty efforts to lift you to a higher plane. Yet Mr. Ware ultimately wins out over such objections by the force and conviction of his art. His quartet with the pianist Matthew Shipp, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Guillermo E. Brown (a recent replacement for Susie Ibarra and the group's weak link) is not simply one of the best working bands in jazz; it's one of the bravest.</p>

        <p>THE tenor saxophonist David S. Ware has a sound so mighty it can put the fear of God into people hearing him for the first time. He is an old-school free-jazz preacher, ordained in the church of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders. A fierce and seemingly inexhaustible improviser, he favors gnarled, guttural utterances that slowly build into shattering crescendos.

He's not especially subtle, but he gets his message across efficiently and at a volume where it cannot be ignored.</p>
        <p>That message is grand and gloomy, and to some ears, faintly oppressive. The music surrounds you with solemnity the way a Renaissance cathedral does, and your first reaction might be to resist all its sweaty efforts to lift you to a higher plane. Yet Mr. Ware ultimately wins out over such objections by the force and conviction of his art. His quartet with the pianist Matthew Shipp, the bassist William Parker and the drummer Guillermo E. Brown (a recent replacement for Susie Ibarra and the group's weak link) is not simply one of the best working bands in jazz; it's one of the bravest.</p>
        <p>The title of Mr. Ware's quartet's latest record, ''Surrendered'' (Sony CK 63816), has, therefore, an odd ring, suggesting a spirit of submission, if not defeat. But I suspect that Mr. Ware's surrender is to some higher power than Sony, since on the evidence of this record his musical defiance remains undiminished. This is turbulent, demanding music that, at its best, possesses an almost terrifying beauty.</p>
        <p>At the same time there is something kinder, something less assaultive to the ear that sets this album apart from Mr. Ware's previous work. Mr. Shipp, an often lugubrious pianist who has tended in the past to run as fast as he can from any approaching groove, no longer sounds as if he is wrestling with Mr. Ware. In fact, Mr. Shipp allows himself to swing with uncharacteristic abandon, turning in some of the most lyrical solos he has committed to record.</p>
        <p>Nearly a third of ''Surrendered'' is devoted to the 16-minute ''African Drums,'' a composition by the free-jazz percussionist Beaver Harris that the Ware quartet has turned into a modal prayer reminiscent of Coltrane's classic quartet. But the most intriguing track -- a cover of Charles Lloyd's ''Sweet Georgia Bright'' -- travels a considerable distance from the gospel according to Trane. Yes, this is the same Charles Lloyd who enchanted flower children three decades ago with his breezy, California style of free jazz. He would seem to be Mr. Ware's opposite: serene rather than grave; a crooner, not a screamer. Yet Mr. Ware seems altogether jubilant chasing the odd tempo changes on ''Sweet Georgia Bright,'' an earthy blues that has a cheerful swagger about it. Relieved, temporarily, of his preacherly duties, he radiates a lightness and grace of a wholly different order.</p>
