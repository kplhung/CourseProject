        <p>The partisan battle over tax cuts heated up in Washington last week as Republicans pushed a measure through Congress that would cut taxes for married couples and President Clinton vowed to veto it.</p>
        <p>The bill, which would cut taxes by $292 billion over 10 years, was packaged by Republicans as a reduction in the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they had remained single.</p>
        <p>But the bill would give an election-year tax break to nearly all married couples, even those who do not pay a marriage penalty.</p>
        <p>A study last year by the Treasury Department found that of 51.4 million tax returns in 1999 from couples filing jointly, 24.8 million, or 48 percent, had a marriage penalty, averaging $1,141. Couples paying the penalty tend to be those in which both partners work; the penalty is most pronounced when husband and wife make about the same amount of money.</p>
        <p>Another 21 million couples, or 41 percent, had a marriage bonus -- that is, they paid less as a couple than they would have if they had remained single. The bonus averaged $1,274. Couples receiving a bonus tend to be those in which only one spouse works.</p>
        <p>''It is not really a bill targeted at the marriage penalty per se,'' said Clint Stretch, a tax policy analyst at Deloitte &amp; Touche, the accounting firm. ''It eliminates some marriage penalties and increases some marriage bonuses.''</p>
        <p>The bill would immediately increase the standard deduction for couples filing jointly so that it is twice the level of the deduction for single people, meaning that it would rise to $8,800 from $7,350. For couples who take the standard deduction, the change would be worth several hundred dollars a year in most cases.</p>
        <p>The bill would also gradually increase the amount of income covered by the 15 percent tax bracket, the lowest of the five tax brackets. For couples filing jointly, the 15 percent bracket currently ends at $43,850; under the bill, it would rise over five years to $52,500, twice the level for single filers. (The brackets are also adjusted each year for inflation.)</p>
        <p>Only couples who earn more than $43,850 would benefit from the expansion of the bracket. The change would be worth up to $1,100 a year to them.</p>
        <p>The big losers from the bill are single taxpayers. They would get nothing.</p>
