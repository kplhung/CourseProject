        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>When I read Herbert Muschamp's article ''The Context Isn't Limited to the Visible'' [July 9], I could have wept at some of his succinct articulations of the ways in which new architecture can pay homage to the old through abstract references rather than literal imitation. I recently finished a master's thesis on interpreting historic urban contexts in new design, at turns inspired, spurred on and spurned by Mr. Muschamp's writings on the state of architecture and historic preservation in New York.</p>

        <p>Innovative, visually contrasting modern buildings are seldom approved or even proposed for review in historic districts; instead, historical pastiche or banal infill is often constructed. And this is certainly not limited to historic districts; witness the faux historical collage of 42nd Street, and buildings with quasi-classical detail constructed throughout the city. We should welcome innovative interpretations of context so new architecture can be a product of our own cultural moment.</p>
