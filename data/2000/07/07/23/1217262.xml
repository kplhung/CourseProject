      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A review of ''Marie Antoinette: The Last Queen of France,'' by Evelyne Lever, in the Book Review last Sunday referred incorrectly to some relationships within the French royal family and misspelled the name of one figure. Marie Leszczynska (not Leszcynska), wife to Louis XV, was a great-granddaughter-in-law of Louis XIV and his queen, not their daughter-in-law. Louis XV had no sisters; he had seven daughters, and four of them lived well into the era of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette or survived it.</p>
