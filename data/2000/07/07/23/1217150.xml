        <p>Not since the 1998 New Beetle, or possibly the '65 Mustang, has a car captivated the public like the PT Cruiser. Here are three other views of the car and the phenomenon:</p>
        <p>Gangster Chic, and More</p>
        <p>Like many people, I fell in love with the PT Cruiser's gangster-retro sheet metal. This, after all, is the car Eliot Ness would want to be seen in, if he were still chasing bootleggers through the mean streets of Chicago. But the PT Cruiser is not just another marketing ploy from the folks who brought you the sensuous (utterly impractical) Prowler and the fierce (utterly impractical) Viper. It is a new category of people mover that sacrifices nothing in style while delivering the versatility of a minivan and the economy of a compact car.</p>

        <p>Sure, it would be nice if the Cruiser had more pep, took rough roads with a bit more composure and breezed through curves as nimbly as, say, the Neon R/T. But where else are you going to find a quiet, comfortable, roomy, inexpensive car that's so much fun to drive?</p>
