        <p>SINCE the beginning of Iran's revolution, by far the most relentless struggle over the social restrictions of the Islamic Republic has concerned what women wear. Now, because of a slight easing of the rules last week, prepubescent schoolgirls will be allowed to wear colors to school.</p>
        <p>Under new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Education, schoolgirls through fifth grade will be allowed to wear ''gay, light colors,'' including light blue, beige, pink, light green and yellow. Until now, only black, brown and navy blue were allowed.</p>
        <p>''The use of light colors helps to create a cheerful atmosphere'' and to ''safeguard the mental health of students,'' the ministry directive stated. But ''loud and gaudy colors'' that are ''not in harmony with the spirit of education'' will not be allowed. Although the all-encompassing black chador remains the favored Islamic dress, it ''in no way can be imposed on the students,'' the directive said.</p>
        <p>The color shift follows a campaign by Zahra Rahnavard, an artist who is president of Al Zahra University, a school for women, to allow girls and women of all ages to wear colorful clothing. ''As an artist I believe colors are important,'' she told a seminar during Women's Week last fall. ''Black is not the color of the revolution and bright colors are divine colors that do not have an anti-revolutionary meaning.''</p>
        <p>She has also claimed that osteoporosis has increased among women, even young women, because sunlight, which helps the body form Vitamin D, does not penetrate their dark clothing. Women in many parts of the countryside have always worn colorful clothing. Many dermatologists, meanwhile, complain that the rubbing of the head covering against the skin contributes to acne and rashes.</p>
        <p>THE easing of the rules goes only so far. Even though girls younger than 9 do not have to wear Islamic dress on the streets, they must do so in state-run schools. So schoolgirls will still have to wear smocklike coats that fall below their knees;  pants, and hoods that cover their heads and necks and expose only their faces. The dress code makes it particularly difficult for schoolgirls to take part in sports like soccer and basketball and run races outdoors. And what kid wants to have to cover up in 100-degree heat?</p>
        <p>The new decree coincides with a quiet but determined revolt among women of all ages against the constraints of their dress. Newspapers have published articles about teenage girls who cut their hair short and dress as boys to avoid having to wear Islamic dress. Women in Tehran are wearing tighter and shorter coats over their pants this summer. And since baring the feet is acceptable in Islam, more women are wearing sandals and painting their toenails in bright colors.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is happy with the new decree about schoolgirls. The conservative newspaper Ressalat charged that the Ministry had not adequately explained why the change was necessary, and it worried what would come next. ''This decree will allow female students to demand other freedoms,'' the newspaper said.</p>
