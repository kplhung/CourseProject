        <p>Wall Street was heartened last week by Alan Greenspan's assurances that the soaring economy is finally winding down to a more manageable pace. Then reality set in.</p>
        <p>Investors are coming to grips with the fact that the slower economy means slower growth and profits for some companies, said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The stock market ended the week lower after many companies either reported weaker quarterly profits or announced that they would. Among the losers were technology bellwethers like Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computer, all of which posted disappointing quarterly results.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in the last year to keep inflation in check, and Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last week that the strategy was working. But higher borrowing costs could make it more difficult for some companies to expand and for consumers to buy their products.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,094.45, down 151.73, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended at 10,733.56, down 79.18.</p>
