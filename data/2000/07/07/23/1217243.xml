        <p>Congress finished work on a Republican bill to give an election-year tax break to married couples. But President Clinton, saying the measure was too costly, promised to veto it. The bill would provide $292 billion in tax cuts over the next decade, and was intended in part to address the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they had remained single. Democrats said they also want to address the penalty, but do it in a less expensive way that directs more benefits to low-  and middle-income people.</p>
