        <p>THEY were married for almost 18 years and had a nice lifestyle: no children, great apartment near Lincoln Center, travel, dinner parties. He was a respected research scientist. She ran her own public relations firm.</p>
        <p>After the divorce 10 years ago, he remarried, had three children and went on to a measure of fame for inventing a device that gives limited vision to the blind. She tried to keep her business going but succumbed to depression and ''not enough billable hours,'' as she put it. She ended up homeless, living in a shelter and relying on food stamps.</p>
        <p>Now comes the legal twist and the moral dilemma. She has taken him to court to modify their divorce agreement, requesting money for a Manhattan apartment and to get back on her feet.</p>
        <p>She is seeking $7,155 a month (it is not clear for how long) and a lump-sum start-up payment of $14,400 to establish a home.</p>
        <p>For his part, the ex-husband says he has his own debts, three young children under 10 and a wife to support, and cannot take responsibility for the woman from whom he was divorced a decade ago.</p>
        <p>The Solomon in this case will be Judge Jacqueline W. Silbermann, State Supreme Court's administrative judge for matrimonial matters.</p>
        <p>As for the law, it says that a financially solvent ex-spouse might indeed have an obligation to an unmarried ex-spouse who has become a public charge or a victim of ''extreme hardship.'' It depends on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
        <p>Judge Silbermann could not comment on this case, but talked generally about the complexity of matrimonial law. No, she said, it does not matter how long ago a couple in such instances had been divorced. And yes, she said, while plenty of women fall into poverty after divorce, the ex-husband often cannot support them.</p>
        <p>But forget the law. As in much of what happens between men and women these days, it's the ethical boundaries that are fuzzy here. What, if anything, do two adults who have legally and socially ended their lives together owe each other?</p>
        <p>The ex-wife in this case will be recognizable to regular readers of this column as Gladys Dobelle.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dobelle, 57, first appeared in this space in early May to relate her nightmarish drop from upper-middle-class respectability to homelessness. Recently called for an update, she said a lawyer had advised her that her divorce agreement could be modified to get her some help to restart her life.</p>
        <p>''I never was the angry wife, but when I realized there was the law and I was two years and a month into homelessness and I saw how hard it is to get out of homelessness, '' Ms. Dobelle said, her voice trailing off.</p>
        <p>''It's corny to say, but from 29 to 44 he got the best years of my life,'' she said. ''The dinner parties for his friends. The press for his business.''</p>
        <p>She is unable to work now, she said: she has skin cancer and eye problems, and needs therapy for post-traumatic stress syndrome.</p>
        <p>Between 1971 and 1988, every member of Ms. Dobelle's immediate family died from various illnesses: her mother, father, sister and brother. As she sought to rebuild the business she had neglected while caring for her ill mother, she was hit with staggering financial problems and a fire in the apartment where she lived and ran her company. She just walked out the door one day. She has not had a home since.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dobelle's trip to court began with a chance encounter on May 3 at an event called Law Day at Union Square Park. Lawyers from around the city sit at tables and offer free services. Ms. Dobelle struck up a conversation with Bernard Dworkin, a Manhattan lawyer who concentrates on family law. She told him her story and he took her case.</p>
        <p>''The issue is not what's fair between two people, but what is the state's burden?'' Mr. Dworkin said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dworkin said whether Ms. Dobelle prevails in court will also depend on Dr. Dobelle's personal net worth and the worth of his business. Dr. Dobelle, 58, is chairman of the Dobelle Institute, a medical device company.</p>
        <p>Neither he nor his lawyer, Andrew Gutman, would comment on the case.</p>
        <p>But in May, after the first column about Gladys Dobelle was published, a woman who identified herself as Dr. Dobelle's current wife left a telephone message saying that her husband had been financially generous to his ex-wife. The woman who said she was the new Mrs. Dobelle also said she felt sorry for the old Mrs. Dobelle.</p>
        <p>For five years after the divorce, according to Gladys Dobelle, her ex-husband paid her $2,100 twice a month in maintenance. She also got to stay in the apartment they had rented. Whether that settlement was generous is a judgment call.</p>
        <p>Now, it up to Judge Silbermann to sort through the soaps and the statistics, the charges and countercharges. A decision is expected in the next few weeks. Stay tuned.</p>
