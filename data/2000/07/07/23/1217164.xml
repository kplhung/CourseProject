        <p>Wired and Fortune magazines are used to competing for advertisers, circulation, staff members and attention. So why not mutual fund dollars?</p>
        <p>Last week, Fortune Group, a unit of Time Warner, announced a plan to open two exchange-traded funds later this year, including one, the Fortune e-50 Index Tracking Stock, that will mirror Fortune's new ''e-50'' Internet index.</p>
        <p>The product, which will trade like a stock, is similar to a mutual fund in that it is a basket of stocks. (It is not a true tracking stock, which reflects the performance of part of one company.)</p>
        <p>The fund is making a late entry into the ever-expanding universe of technology funds, going up up against the 19-month-old, $195 million Guinness Flight Wired Index fund, which is based on a 40-stock index compiled by Wired.</p>
        <p>Neither publication has been what one might call modest in describing its own stock-picking prowess. Fortune billed its e-50 as ''the ultimate Internet index'' on its cover last December and proclaimed inside that it had ''the potential to upstage the Dow.'' That recalled the June 1998 cover of Wired, heralding the birth of its index with ''Forget the Dow. Here comes the new economy!'' emblazoned over a picture of Godzilla on the rampage.</p>
        <p>Vivek Shah, director of new business ventures for Fortune Group, said the e-50 was different, because Wired includes  stocks like DaimlerChrysler in a new-economy index that Wired says should include technologically savvy companies in all business sectors.</p>
        <p>''The e-50 is an Internet company index,'' Mr. Shah said. ''It's not a new-economy index.'' The Fortune product will charge investors lower fees than traditional mutual funds like Wired's, he said.</p>
        <p>Which fund will prove mightiest? The warm-up round goes to Wired. Its index rose 12.4 percent this year through Thursday, versus 2.3 percent for the e-50.</p>
        <p>But Wired will not be Fortune's only media competitor. Exchange-traded funds like Fortune's already track technology and Internet indexes compiled by Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. And Fortune's other new offering, based on its 45-year-old Fortune 500 annual ranking of large companies, will no doubt be measured against the tens of billions of investment fund dollars pegged to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, maintained by McGraw-Hill, publisher of Business Week. The good news here for Fortune is that its 500 have outperformed S.&amp; P.'s, not to mention the Dow industrials, by a fair margin so far this year.</p>
