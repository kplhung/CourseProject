        <p>Classical composers are not alone, of course, in wanting a permanent record. No matter that compared with classical performance, jazz is like the shifting sands.  There is still an urge to capture the moment.</p>
        <p>Jeff Brown, who runs the Westchester School of Guitar in Ossining, recorded ''In From the Edge'' in much the same spirit as Ms. Lipper made her disc.  ''It's a statement I've needed to make after 25 years of being involved in music,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Edge'' is available on the Internet at Amazon.com for $15.99. Mr. Brown composed all nine of the disc's numbers, which have impressionistic titles like ''Blues Falling Down,'' ''In a Rainstorm'' and ''The Hill.'' The performers, members of the Jeff Brown Quartet, include Gil Goldstein on piano, Ned Mann on acoustic bass, John Arrucci on drums and vibraphone and Mr. Brown on electric and acoustic guitars. Mr. Brown described the music as ''a little understated, not oppressive.''</p>
