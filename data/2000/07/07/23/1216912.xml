        <p>Leif Johannessen and Garry Kasparov, TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, New York, June 27, 2000</p>
        <p>Leif Johannessen (far left, seated): ''I like the idea of chess as a war. You are leading your troops and maneuvering and thinking strategically. But this was almost like a fairy tale. My team, the Norwegian Top Athletes Gymnasium, won in the European zone of the World School Chess Championships, so we were invited to New York to play Garry Kasparov. That's funny, to play the world's strongest player man to man. In the beginning, I think he underestimated me. I saw an article about him a month ago saying he wasn't actually that good, that people are just afraid of playing him. He uses a lot of psychology. He seems so confident. It's almost impossible to play him. He tried to use that stuff against me too, but I didn't look at him. I focused on only the game. Right then I was just concentrating to the maximum. Actually I was winning at some point. It was a great feeling. Only at the end, when we had just one minute left, he showed he was much better than me. I blundered, lost my nerve or something, and he played very well. Afterward, I realized all this attention is really strange. It was almost too much. To think I could have beaten the world champion so easily if I had just concentrated a bit more. Maybe next time.''</p>

        <p>Garry Kasparov (right): ''With everything I try to do, I try to do it perfectly. But I had just arrived in New York after a very tough tournament the night before. I was jet-lagged and not in the best shape. Those are not kids, you know, from the street. They take chess seriously. They are well trained; they are very professional. At that moment I was not the happiest man on the earth because my position was nearly lost. It was a very tough moment: I was punishing myself by saying how badly I played, that I'm going to lose. So the last 30 minutes were not a very happy 30 minutes. There was nothing I could do. Then he made his final blunder, and by miracle I won the game. Those are not great feelings. You expect me to win. But he definitely had good nerve.''</p>
