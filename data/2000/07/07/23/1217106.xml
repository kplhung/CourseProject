        <p>THE mores of the fashion industry were taken from 18th-century Versailles,'' Simon Doonan was saying. ''It's a structure that's complicated by the fact that everyone in it is terrified of losing advertising -- the sword of Damocles. So fragility and fear are driving this need, these conventions.''</p>
        <p>We were discussing the pervasiveness of flattery in the fashion business -- it is coin of the realm -- and its remarkable, necessary plasticity. ''My favorite example is going backstage,'' Mr. Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York, said, ''and the designer says, 'Well, did you like it?' and you loathe whatever it was he or she has done and so you say, 'You've done it again!' which is a phrase that hides a multitude of sins. Equally useful are phrases like, 'It was unbelievable!' or 'It was beyond!' With those you've enthused properly, and that makes everybody happy.''</p>
        <p>Last month, Richard Stengel, a Time magazine editor, published a history of flattery, ''You're Too Kind'' (Simon &amp; Schuster). Citing, er, Hegel (it's that kind of book), he describes a kind of ''heroism of flattery'' in which, he writes, ''the individual had come to understand the inherent falseness of society and that he bravely understood that he must play to get along.''</p>
        <p>Viewed this way, the gassy insincerity and the unctuous kiss-kiss that are at the heart of the fashion vernacular are like Trojan horses of dialogue. Each ''enthuser'' is, in fact, heroic, a wily Odysseus rather than just a shrill suck-up made tipsy with hyperbole, like poor old Edie on ''Absolutely Fabulous.'' ''We're not stupid,'' said Stefan Campbell, an American stylist who just returned from his first haute couture season in Paris. ''We know that our world is very tiny and that people move around very quickly. So we tell these little white lies.''</p>
        <p>Real fashion people don't suck up. They declaim, from the height of aesthetic authority: ''The shoe is everything!'' ''She's genius!'' ''You're the bomb!'' Because to flatter someone means that you get their look, that you're in on the signals being telegraphed. In other words, flattery in fashion doesn't debase the flatterer, it puffs him or her up. It confers status and legitimacy and links the declaimer and the recipient in a kind of ''on the bus'' grooviness.</p>
        <p>''An educated consumer is my best customer,'' said Jill Kopelman, whose screenplay ''Intern,'' a roman a clef about being an intern at a fashion magazine, is coming out this fall from Given Films. ''That's someone who understands that 'Forget Bianca and her equine escort' means 'You're looking fabulously 80's,' and that's a compliment.''</p>
        <p>The flavor of these pronouncements is spiced by the times. While the old continental accent has largely been subsumed by a younger, more hip-hop affect -- ''Divine!'' having given way to ''That's ill!'' -- it still pops up, thanks to the ironic place we find ourselves in. This is why ''genius,'' ''legendary'' and ''perfection'' are once again in favor, as in, ''That bag is genius!''</p>
        <p>Anna Sui, the designer, and Steven Meisel, the photographer, whose works make frequent reference to fashion history, brought ''genius'' back into the fashion lexicon (it dates from the 1960's), even though Ms. Sui herself now favors approbations like ''sweetums'' and ''cute-ums,'' said Paul Cavaco, who is the creative director of Allure magazine and a fine proclaimer himself. ''I'm gagulating'' is a Cavaco-ism that translates into high praise.</p>
        <p>Fashion syntax favors abstractions, Dick Page, a British makeup artist, said, citing how people in the business refer to someone, or a part of someone, as a thing. ''We love the hair!'' ''The body is amazing!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavaco will tell you that he and his peers aren't word people. ''I sound like English is my third or fourth language,'' he said. But the pictures their phrases conjure fairly throb with detail. Ms. Kopelman cited this example: ''You see someone and you say, 'Omigod, it's so 18th-century bordello meets Tom Ford meets L. L. Bean by way of the Vault!' ''</p>
        <p>Indeed, you might say that fashion folk have unique and unparalleled linguistic skills, and that their excitement for the visual is matched only by their excitement for the verbal. These people snack on language; they imbibe words as you would a pink cosmopolitan, and to similar effect. They use words like Nerf balls, catching them lightly and then batting them back off the top of your head.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Miller, a creative consultant, whose work includes the revamping of the Hush Puppies label, explained: ''Besides the hard work and sheer luck, the real reason the brand became successful again was the nonsensical sound of the name. Hush Puppies! Fashion people could really roll those words off their tongue. They couldn't say them fast enough.''</p>
        <p>Repetition still works, especially in print and when coupled with huge type and lots of underlinings. ''When I was at Vogue, I used to get these faxes from Andre,'' Mr. Cavaco said, referring to the magazine's famously effusive editor at large, Andre Leon Talley, ''and they were always in a font that was 50 times larger than normal, telling me about a 'fabulous, fabulous, fabulous bag.' ''</p>
        <p>Flattery can be fuel. Nian Fish is the creative director of KCD, the international fashion publicity and production company that puts on shows for Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Versace. One of Ms. Fish's jobs is to send the models out on the runway imbued with energy and confidence. ''Models are notoriously insecure, of course,'' she said. ''I flatter them according to their personality. I say: 'You are the hottest Brazilian girl this season. Go!' 'You are wearing the most expensive dress in the collection. Sell it!' 'You are Ralph's favorite model this season. Believe it!' 'Your eyes are brilliant. Show them!' ''</p>
        <p>With the women, it's all quite serious, Ms. Fish explained. ''The guys are different,'' she said. ''You can use humor. You can say, 'Show that package!' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fish is thankful the days of the supermodel are gone, for the flattery required to run the machine took a lot out of her. ''The diva treatment was extreme flattery, coaxing girls to get in the lineup when they didn't want to,'' she explained. And they never seemed to want to. ''I once had to chase a famous supermodel down 42nd Street,'' Ms. Fish recalled. ''I had to pull her out of a cab, tell her she was the star of the show, the No. 1 star of the show, and we needed her. I had to beg her. The whole thing about the old supermodels is they got so much attention through flattery, and it raised the bar. What they needed was so increased it turned them into caricatures of divas.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, flattery is kind. Kennedy Fraser, who wrote about fashion for The New Yorker during the 1970's and early 80's, saw poignancy instead of pragmatism. ''People know that their businesses could just crash through the floor,'' she said the other day, ''and so you get this sort of whistling in the dark. It's a harsh business, and so people do whatever they can for each other to somehow cushion themselves.''</p>
        <p>Which is why if you wander onto a fashion shoot where Dick Page is working, you might hear him sum up the day's work as a ''pageant of joy!''</p>
