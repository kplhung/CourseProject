        <p>Nancy Ortiz-Sharp had a typical South Bronx childhood: fall to spring was devoted to school, and her summers were spent running under water spewing from fire hydrants and climbing fire escapes. Because her parents divorced, her mother raised her and her sister, Shirley, on a beautician's salary, leaving them little money for vacations.</p>
        <p>When she turned 10, something was added to her summers. She left New York for the first time, through the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides needy children from the city with free vacations in the country.</p>
        <p>What began as annual trips lasting only two weeks on a farm in Histand, Pa., eventually became entire summers spent with her host family.</p>
        <p>''It changed my life,'' said Ms. Ortiz-Sharp, now 54, who lives in a rural setting similar to those she visited during her childhood getaways. Sitting on a bench beside her 18th-century farmhouse, shadowed by a grand white barn for the 28 sheep grazing nearby, Ms. Ortiz-Sharp recalled her trips.</p>
        <p>''Visiting the Histand farm gave me an opportunity to have responsibility for the animals; they depended on me,'' she said. ''It broadened my horizons and was an awakening that there was more out there.''</p>
        <p>She went on to work at Pfizer,, where she met her husband, David Sharp. They settled in the city and lived there until 1986, when they moved to their 10-acre farm in Bedminster Township, Pa. She and her husband, who recently retired, had busy schedules that kept them from serving as hosts for a child, Ms. Ortiz-Sharp said. But as a way to give back to the program that influenced her life, the couple decided to hold annual picnics on their farm.</p>
        <p>So, on a recent Saturday, despite forecasts of rain, the couple held their 10th picnic for Fresh Air Fund children and the families who had volunteered to be their hosts.</p>
        <p>About noon, Ms. Ortiz-Sharp started greeting families with visiting city children, 15 in all, while Daria Marmaluk-Hajioannou, a folk singer who is a volunteer and a host parent, performed.</p>
        <p>''The picnic is a venue for exchange,'' said Judy Langan of Doylestown, Pa., the Bucks County Fresh Air Fund chairwoman and a board member. ''We all learn from the process. We help each other.''</p>
        <p>As the sun illuminated overhanging clouds, the children ate grilled hot dogs and hamburgers and made their way to other attractions. Ken Moyer, a host parent, and his son Drew, of Quakertown, Pa., were dressed as clowns and twisted balloons into hats and animals.</p>
        <p>Adjacent to the backyard activities, hayrides transported picknickers to and from a neighbor's pool. There, many of the Fresh Air children swam, some of them eagerly showing off their newly learned water skills. ''I am just starting, said Diamond Motford, 9, of Brooklyn, wearing a bright pink bathing suit. ''I don't know any strokes, but I can float!''</p>
        <p>Randy Jamison, 16, had no time to swim. He was too busy catching up with old friends. This was not his first year at the picnic with his host parents, Andrea Deimal and Jim Freeman of Chalfont, Pa. Sixty-five percent of the children in the program who are reinvited by their host families annually, and Randy is one of them.</p>
        <p>Randy lives in Chalfont now. His mother moved there from New York City this year with the assistance of Ms. Deimal, who helped her find a job at Doylestown hospital and an apartment. ''It is a better environment here,'' said Randy.</p>
        <p>A whistle signaled that the final hayride was heading back to the  farmhouse for a shepherding demonstration.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to see sheep,'' said Ma-leik Baker, 8, of Brooklyn. But his consternation quickly faded. He ended up being the first to volunteer for the demonstration, eagerly entering the oversize pen along with two other children.</p>
        <p>They tried earnestly to follow Mr. Sharp's instructions about how to herd the sheep from the right corner to the left, but the task proved more difficult than they had thought. Two black and white Border collies, Vega and Rigel, took over. The dogs, following commands and whistles, showed them how the job was done. ''That is how I'll do it next time,'' said Ma-leik.</p>
        <p>As the picnic ended, Ms. Langan, an accomplished printmaker, gave Ms. Ortiz-Sharp an original watercolor print for her hard work. As soon as Ms. Ortiz-Sharp unwrapped her gift, raindrops began to fall.</p>
        <p>Families who are interested in having a child stay with them or who wish to inquire about registering their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003 or visit the agency's Web site, www.freshair.org.</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the agency can send a check to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
