        <p>IN ''Power Plays: Shakespeare's Lessons in Leadership and Management'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), John O.

        <p>IN ''Power Plays: Shakespeare's Lessons in Leadership and Management'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000), John O. Whitney and Tina Packer honor their subject with a pleasurable and instructive book.  They give us an engaging testament on practicality and morality in business, richly illuminated by instances from Shakespeare, all expertly dissected. A reader whose memories of Shakespeare's magic are lost in cobwebs can expect a treat.</p>
        <p>Professor Whitney, lover of Shakespeare and senior professor at the Columbia Business School, provides the business wisdom. An expert on saving troubled companies, he writes with the assurance of a half-century in business. The book has lots of cases (Did James Robinson get the heave-ho at American Express because, like Richard II, he neglected his realm?), but the professor is most cogent in holding his own experiences up to Shakespeare's mirror.</p>
        <p>A wise old bird, he instructs as often from mistakes as from accomplishments. At times a chief executive, at other times No. 2, he has absorbed the ways and means and machinations of command.</p>
        <p>The reader hears a lot about Pathmark Supermarkets, where Professor Whitney, installed as chief operating officer, led a notably successful turnaround three decades ago. As the applause rolled in, he was sure he had a lock on the chief executive's chair. In fact, people had knives out for him, an outsider and an unwelcome savior. ''I was foolish -- and blind, to boot,'' he writes on reflection. It was an outcome worthy of ''Henry IV.''</p>
        <p>At his elbow as he writes is Ms. Packer, once of the Royal Shakespeare Company, who came to this country to present Shakespeare as it should be presented. She is founder and chief executive of Shakespeare &amp; Company, a thriving theater in Lenox, Mass. She and the professor are a congenial pair. He has exulted in Shakespeare all his adult life; her creation has become a sizable business.</p>
        <p>Professor Whitney writes most of the book. Ms. Packer periodically steps on stage to add a creative dramatist's understanding of what it is to act or how actors rise above self-consciousness.</p>
        <p>She also offers fresh thinking on Shakespeare's women and power.  She admires the Rosalind of ''As You Like It,'' free-spirited and independent, preferring her over the tormented Ophelia of ''Hamlet''; but Ms. Packer is especially taken with the cunning Cleopatra. In an epilogue, Ms. Packer finds a new set of corporate values in Shakespeare's late plays, based on redemption and collaboration, not bloodshed and deceit.</p>
        <p>But the magnetic voice here is Shakespeare's. He ''plumbed more deeply into the problems of leadership than anyone before him and most who came after.'' On leadership and power, Professor Whitney finds gold in the kingship plays and  the great tragedies.</p>
        <p>''Hamlet'' provides a contrasting backdrop for an admiring sketch of Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com, whose focus, decisiveness and fleetness of foot compare so starkly with the breast-beating vacillation of the Prince of Denmark. (''Hamlet cannot lead, manage, or follow.'')</p>
        <p>The authors take three topics in order -- power, persuasion, values -- and a good book gets even better when it gets to values. Anyone who mines Shakespeare for insights on power can't miss, and this discussion doesn't. The section on persuasion offers, as the model inspirational speech, Henry V's immortal call to arms on the eve of Agincourt, with the English outnumbered five to one. It reminds us how masterfully the young king played the theme of honor until the woefully discouraging odds became a rallying point.</p>
        <p>We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.</p>
        <p>For he today that sheds his blood with me</p>
        <p>Shall be my brother. . . .</p>
        <p>And to turn a hostile crowd, what example could trump Mark Antony's oration at Caesar's funeral?</p>
        <p>The noble Brutus</p>
        <p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;</p>
        <p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
        <p>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</p>
        <p>Polonius, the foolish old man in ''Hamlet,'' was given to fatuous declarations:</p>
        <p>To thine ownself be true,</p>
        <p>And it must follow as the night the day</p>
        <p>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
        <p>The aphorism is ''patently absurd,'' Professor Whitney declares,  given that interests are at least as likely to clash as coincide, and he sets off on an exploration of how Man Alone squares with Man in Society.  His musings take him to Frank Sinatra (''I did it my way'') as well as Ralph Waldo Emerson. Eventually he decides that the best of religion and law, checked by the free market, provides the most hopeful reconciliation. Happily, he notes that Shakespeare -- a wealthy, worldly man as well as playwright -- was at home in a market-driven society.</p>
        <p>PROFESSOR WHITNEY has a soft spot for Sir John Falstaff, the quick-witted, carousing reprobate who instructed Prince Hal in the true nature of his domain. But when Hal became King Henry V, he stunned Jack Falstaff by banishing him summarily. Was his fate just?</p>
        <p>Falstaff becomes the opportunity to talk about business's distaste for the inspired oddball. The professor has his share of maverick blood; in his turnaround days, he once made a point by publicly torching the company-policy manual. And it tickled him to play host to a visiting chief executive in the company cafeteria.</p>
        <p>So he accepts Falstaff's fall from favor, but most reluctantly: ''I would have fired him for his actions, not his thoughts.'' Falstaff takes bribes, flops in battle, commits highway robbery. ''Banish the Jack Falstaff of 'Henry IV,' yes, but banish him with love, care and caution.''</p>
        <p>The professor sets tough moral standards. ''Deceit is at the center of all of Shakespeare's tragedies,'' he writes, adding that it is not unknown in business. Iago deceives Othello.  Richard III deceives almost everyone. Cassius seduces Brutus into the plot to kill Caesar.</p>
        <p>So is it ethical in business, Professor Whitney asks, when one has decided to leave a company and start one's own, to furtively recruit colleagues to come along? Deceit always harms, he answers, if only the deceit of self. ''Is deception acceptable if it harms no one? By now, we realize that this is an oxymoron,'' he says. But the world cannot live without deception, he concedes: ''Shakespeare, the great philosopher, and life itself make us confront it. When is it justified? When is it not?''</p>
        <p>The Slings And Arrows Of Fortune</p>
        <p>JOHN O. WHITNEY, who wrote ''Power Plays'' with Tina Packer, says he has solved the knottiest problems by curling up with one of Shakespeare's 39 plays and letting the answer emerge.  ''Power Plays'' concludes with these broodings on his debt to Hamlet:</p>
        <p>''Hamlet was confused. He did not know his company well. The policies, practices, procedures and politics at Elsinore did not seem to appeal to him. If he wished to justify his actions, his market was the nobles at court and the people of Denmark. Although it appears that he was well liked as a young prince, we have no evidence that he cared about either the people or the nobles.  And he seemed oblivious to the future, never giving a serious thought to the consequences of his action or, more important, his inaction. . . .</p>
        <p>''It saddens me to have been so harsh with the young prince of Denmark. He had such promise. Every time I read one of his soliloquies or notice one of his brilliant verbal ripostes, I learn more about myself, more about others and more about the world. For these reasons, I admire Hamlet enormously.</p>
        <p>''I get angry with him primarily because he confronts me with so many of my own shortcomings. Too many times, I have lapsed into reacting rather than acting. Too many times, I have succumbed to various forms of hand-wringing, breast-beating, rage, intransigence and impatience. Too many times, I have been unable to reframe an issue, or to know which world I was living in, let alone to understand it. But my impatience with Hamlet is also my debt to him. There have been those times, also, when he gave me fair warning.</p>
        <p>''Through his and Shakespeare's mirror I have seen myself; and although it is not a property of mirrors, I have been able to look ahead, to steer out of harm's way, to take charge, and, unlike the unfortunate Dane, to create my own destiny.''</p>
