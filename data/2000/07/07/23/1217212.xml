        <p>As Tiger Woods pulled away from the pack today at the British Open, many of his pursuers grew increasingly frustrated.</p>
        <p>It was a difficult day for Fred Couples (72), Phil Mickelson (71), Sergio Garcia (73), Tom Lehman (70) and Ernie Els (70), all of whom were virtually eliminated from contention. Several times during his round, Garcia swung his club angrily into the ground. Three times during his first nine holes, Garcia's tee shots landed in sand divots in the fairway. Then to top off his frustration, Garcia hit into the Road Hole bunker at No. 17, resulting in a double-bogey. Garcia plummeted to six under par for the tournament, a distant 10 strokes behind Woods.</p>

        <p>As Tiger Woods pulled away from the pack today at the British Open, many of his pursuers grew increasingly frustrated.</p>
        <p>It was a difficult day for Fred Couples (72), Phil Mickelson (71), Sergio Garcia (73), Tom Lehman (70) and Ernie Els (70), all of whom were virtually eliminated from contention. Several times during his round, Garcia swung his club angrily into the ground. Three times during his first nine holes, Garcia's tee shots landed in sand divots in the fairway. Then to top off his frustration, Garcia hit into the Road Hole bunker at No. 17, resulting in a double-bogey. Garcia plummeted to six under par for the tournament, a distant 10 strokes behind Woods.</p>
        <p>''It's so frustrating, more frustrating when you are playing well,'' said Garcia, who also missed several crucial putts from less than six feet. ''You hit it close and suddenly it goes away from the hole. It's just one par after another, and you lose your strength.''</p>
        <p>Garcia entered the day hoping to work his way into the final round against Woods, the way the second-place David Duval did today. Duval shot a bogey-free 66 and trailed Woods by six strokes. But Garcia made only two birdies.</p>
        <p>Lehman, who finished at eight under par, eight behind Woods, said: ''I look at the board and I'm just getting lapped, and that's not fun. I couldn't get the putter going. I hit the hole five or six times, just singed the hole, but nothing fell. I probably hit every green, hit all the fairways, and had 35 putts. I threw away, let get away, four or five shots, and there's no reason that I couldn't be in with a reasonable chance tomorrow. One round, anything's possible, but it's going to be pretty difficult for me.''</p>
        <p>Amateur Champion Turning Pro</p>
        <p>David Gossett, last year's United States Amateur champion, announced today that he was turning professional. His first tournament as a pro will be the International next month in Castle Pines, Colo. He will also play in at least three other PGA Tour events this year -- the Reno-Tahoe Open, the Bell Canadian Open and the Westin Texas Open at LaCantera.</p>
        <p>A two-time all-American at the University of Texas, Gossett figured the time was right to turn professional, even though he had two years of collegiate eligibility remaining. He will be represented by Gaylord Sports Management.</p>
        <p>''I feel I can play with these guys,'' said Gossett, who shot 71 at the British Open on Thursday but faltered with a 78 on Friday and missed the cut. ''I just had a gut feeling that the time was right. I'm very proud of what I did in my amateur career, but now I'm looking forward to my professional career.''</p>
        <p>Gossett hopes to get three additional sponsor exemptions, which would allow him to play seven tournaments this year. If Gossett does not earn enough money in those events to secure his PGA Tour card, he plans to attend qualifying school in the fall.</p>
        <p>Quite a First Impression</p>
        <p>David Toms (nine under par, 69-67-71) will not forget his first experience playing with Tiger Woods today.</p>
        <p>''To see him on top of his game was pretty impressive,'' Toms said. ''He deserves all the accolades he gets. He's pretty awesome. You'd like to see more guys challenging to make it interesting for the golf fans, but if he's that much better than everybody else, then what can you say?''</p>
