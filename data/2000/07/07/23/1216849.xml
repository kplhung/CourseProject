        <p>THE most triumphant moment of the whole trip to Japan occurred on the grounds of the stupendous 16th century ''white heron'' castle of Himeji.</p>
        <p>There, with the castle towering above us, we encountered three men dressed as samurai, and my 4-year-old son, Anatol, knew his Japanese dreams had come true. Using gestures, the three samurai invited the American child to pose with them, and even put a sword in his hands, while his two siblings snapped photos. For the rest of the trip, Anatol mentioned casually, many times a day, that he had met real samurai, and held a real samurai sword.</p>
        <p>It started with the frequent-flier tickets. My older children had two weeks of school vacation, and we had this vague idea of going somewhere exciting. But where do you take a 10th-grade boy (Orlando), a sixth-grade girl (Josephine) and a 4-year-old, not to mention two well-meaning and reasonably well-traveled parents? We had initially thought of Greece -- all that classical heritage, lots of ruins to climb on. Everyone was fairly enthusiastic about that, though the older kids were wary about being taken to too many museums.</p>
        <p>It turned out that for our miles we could get only three tickets to Athens. But I was told about a special sale on tickets to Tokyo, and we had enough miles for five free tickets.</p>
        <p>We discussed this with our usual thoroughness: ''Japan?''</p>
        <p>''Cool!'' said Orlando, the 16-year-old. And we booked the tickets. (It subsequently turned out that we had been given incorrect information about this ''sale'' and were not actually entitled to the tickets, but Delta honored the offer.)</p>
        <p>As a family, we have no special connection to Japan. Orlando has a brown belt in karate and can count to 10 in Japanese. That and a certain familiarity with ''The Mikado'' was about the sum of our cultural and linguistic expertise. We worried about the language barrier and the possible expense  -- our goal was a decidedly budget-level trip.</p>
        <p>Before we left, we bought Japan Rail Pass vouchers, giving us unlimited train travel for one week.</p>
        <p>We also booked just one hotel room for our first three nights in Tokyo, using a brochure from the Japan tourist office in Manhattan that listed the members of the Japanese Inn Group throughout the country. This consortium of inexpensive Japanese-style inns provides mostly ryokan accommodations -- you sleep on futons, you often share a bathroom, and you take off your shoes before entering the inn. I called one of the inns in Tokyo and talked with a helpful man who spoke a little English and said he had a room big enough for the five of us.</p>
        <p>And so we flew from Boston via Atlanta to Tokyo, a fairly easy flight, though a long one. We watched a bunch of movies. Ate meals at what seemed like random moments. Orlando and Josephine studied the phrase books, occasionally informing us; we learned, for example, that an unmarried woman over 25 used to be referred to as ''Christmasu Cakie'' because nobody wants to eat Christmas cake after Christmas.</p>
        <p>Parentally, we suggested practicing greetings and numbers and directional words. And when in Tokyo, we found our way onto the cheap train and then the subway to our hotel, the Ryokan Kikuya, where there was indeed a big room waiting for us with four folded futons. Each hotel we stayed in in Japan assumed that a 4-year-old would sleep with his parents, and Anatol obliged, cheerfully occupying the space on the futons between us until by morning he had wiggled between the mattresses and onto the tatami mat floor.</p>
        <p>We spent two days in Tokyo, sightseeing as hard as we could. The subway system lived up to its reputation: complicated, at times amazingly crowded, spotless and unbelievably efficient. There are some subway maps with only Japanese characters, some  with English names for stations; at major stations there are attendants who can answer questions. We got pretty good at using the vending machines to buy tickets, and at following the signs from line to line.</p>
        <p>Up early one morning, we took the subway to the Tsukiji district to see the famous fish market, in the process getting a taste of Tokyo rush hour, complete with its gloved ''pushers'' stuffing people into the trains. The fish market was overwhelming: what seemed like miles and miles of fish from bins of the tiny to huge slabs of the gigantic. We found food ready to eat in the city market nearby: round, fresh octopus fritters; skewers of grilled eel; cold sliced omelet with duck meat.</p>
        <p>We wandered in the neighborhoods of downtown Tokyo, visiting the Sony building in the Ginza district, where we tried on glasses that projected videos in front of our eyes and played very advanced PlayStation games (well, some of us).</p>
        <p>We visited the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park and admired Buddha statues and painted screens (well, some of us). Our hotel was in the Asakusa area, one of the older Tokyo neighborhoods, and right nearby was the seventh-century Sensoji, the oldest temple in Tokyo. It is approached down Nakamise Dori, a lane of what you would have to classify as Japanese temple tchotchke shops. We bought hot little cakes flavored with green tea, and Orlando got his fortune told in the temple, shaking a box until a stick fell out, then matching the number on that stick to a little drawer and extracting a paper fortune, complete with English translation.</p>
        <p>And then we activated our rail passes, having previously exchanged the vouchers at a special office at Tokyo Station, and for the next week we zipped around the island of Honshu, obeying the universal rail pass imperative of making it pay by traveling as much as possible. The trains were almost all Shinkansen, the famous bullet trains. From Tokyo to Kyoto, then on to Nara, Hiroshima, the castle town of Himeji, the mountain village of Takayama, and finally, the historic resort city of Nikko.</p>
        <p>AS soon as we arrived in a new city, we would reserve train seats to the next city, communicating with the officials in the train office by pointing to the trains we wanted on the timetables and showing our passes. Sometimes they spoke some English; they were always patient, and the little pasteboard reservation cards they gave us always turned out to be for the right trains at the right times on the right tracks.</p>
        <p>We reserved hotels by calling ahead to the next city as well; the Japanese telephone system was easy to use with the phone cards we bought along the way. We slept extremely comfortably on the ryokan futons, usually paying just over $100 a night for the five of us, although we were traveling in low season. Japanese yukata (robes) were provided, as were thermoses of green tea, and we were made to feel very welcome.</p>
        <p>These are not the elegant traditional ryokan inns that feature Japanese antiques and beautifully arranged meals, but they generated a certain kind of family togetherness and good humor as we tried to remember the rules about shoes (leave your own at the entrance and put on slippers, leave the slippers at the door to your room, and be sure to change into toilet slippers when you visit the bathroom).</p>
        <p>In Kyoto one morning, we started out to sightsee in the rain, and the proprietress of the Ryokan Murakamiya insisted on supplying us with umbrellas, one apiece, taking great care to select the appropriate umbrella (size, color, importance) for each family member.</p>
        <p>We visited Nijo Castle, built by the first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu. The building, constructed of cypress and decorated with painted wall panels and screens, is famous for its nightingale floors, which ''sing'' when you walk on them -- a security measure that made it impossible to sneak up on anyone.</p>
        <p>At Kinkakuji, the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, we wandered in the temple garden, admiring the pavilion in its lake setting. There were many Japanese high school students, in uniform, and it turned out that their assignment was to practice English by finding foreigners and conversing with them. Since foreigners were in short supply, each member of our family patiently went through several rounds of the set questions. All the students were reading from the same script: May I ask you some questions? What do you think of Kyoto? Shall we take a picture together?</p>
        <p>Also in Kyoto, we visited Ryoanji Temple, where the famous Zen rock garden in all its harmony of rock and sand survived the energy of our family's visit. At Nara, the site of the first permanent Japanese capital (in 710), there were sacred deer in Narakoen park; you buy special ''deer cookies'' to feed them.</p>
        <p>Another rainy day, in Hiroshima, was oddly divided between the memories of the atomic bomb and the pace of the modern city that has risen since 1945. We started with a visit to the Peace Memorial Museum in Peace Memorial Park, with its careful re-creation, in models and pictures, of what the city looked like before the bomb was dropped, and then after. The exhibit has been expanded to take more cognizance of the course of the war prior to 1945, in particular of Japanese military activities and war crimes in Asia.</p>
        <p>We walked across the park to the cenotaph, the flame burning beneath it, and Anatol rang the peace bell. We saw the thousand cranes statue in honor of a young leukemia victim and, across the river from the park, the skeletal A-Bomb Dome. In the afternoon, we were wandering in a vibrant city, through streets and streets of arcadelike shopping districts and restaurants, thinking inevitable thoughts about human resilience and rebuilding.</p>
        <p>In Takayama, after a beautiful ride through the mountains on a special train with enormous windows, we visited old wooden houses. At the morning pickle market along the river, all kinds of unusual mountain vegetables were for sale in pickled form, and samples on toothpicks were freely offered.</p>
        <p>Oh yes, we ate. The food was terrific everywhere in Japan. Among the five of us, there is a range in what you might call adventurous seafood eating -- Josephine, who is 10, eats pretty much everything, even if it's still moving. The rest of us are ranged a bit behind her. But everyone liked the food -- big bowls of noodle soup, sushi, shabu-shabu one night at an all-you-can-eat joint where you just kept bringing your tray back and getting more raw meat and vegetables to cook.</p>
        <p>In Hiroshima, the local specialty is okonomiyaki, a complex omelet involving vegetables and meat and seafood and Worcestershire sauce.  We found our way to okonomiyaki stands, dozens of them, where we sat at a counter, watching a highly skilled cook put our omelets together. All over Japan, we patronized the many excellent French pastry shops for breakfast, and I discovered my ideal breakfast confection: a large flat pastry topped with flakes of dried fish and seaweed. I still yearn for it.</p>
        <p>We also did very well at conveyor belt sushi establishments, where you sit at stools along a counter and take plates of whatever interests you off the moving belt; a spout on the counter dispenses green tea; someone counts up your empty plates to calculate your bill. One night, we also tried robatayaki, little dishes of food cooked to our order and served to us on a long wooden paddle: sardines, snails, pork skewers, pumpkin. Everywhere in Japan there are window displays of plastic food, showing you exactly what you'll get. We quickly got over any embarrassment about leading the waitress outside the restaurant and pointing at the window.</p>
        <p>In fact, we pretty quickly got over all embarrassment about everything, even the 10th grader and the sixth grader, who have been known, in their home country, to be mortified by any public utterance made by a parent or sibling.</p>
        <p>IN Japan, it was just too obvious that we were the completely clueless, linguistically impaired strangers that we were.  It became a family joke: whenever we beckoned the waitress out into the street to look at the plastic food displays, one of the children would hiss loudly, ''Now they're going to think we're tourists!''</p>
        <p>Our last major stop before returning to Tokyo was Nikko, 90 miles north of Tokyo, site of the tombs and shrines of the first Tokugawa shogun and his descendants. There we spent the day seeing shrines and admiring the colorful and ornately carved architecture of the shrines and gates set among the cedar groves. These buildings are very different in style from the other temples we visited; they teem with animals and figures and colors, ornate and elaborate and liberally gilded.</p>
        <p>We had reserved rooms at the grand old hotel, the Nikko Kanaya, founded in 1873. We had asked for their cheapest rooms, with no private bath, but they kindly upgraded us. In the evening, we gave ourselves a taste of grand hotel life. We descended on the main dining hall and ate local rainbow trout, grilled with soy sauce, and Larry and I had sake. We wandered the halls of the hotel, looking at photos of former guests, of roadsters and ice skating parties, of registers signed by everyone from Helen Keller to Eleanor Roosevelt to Charles Lindbergh to Indira Gandhi.</p>
        <p>And then it was back to Tokyo for a couple of days, with that odd sensation of coming back to a completely foreign city that now seems oddly familiar and comforting. We let Orlando lead us through the electronics district of Akihabara, where the neon was nonstop and the video games were wall to wall, took the elevator to the top of the Metropolitan Government towers for the view over Tokyo from the 45th floor, visited the enormous Takashimaya Times Square department store. And finally home, where the first order of business was to develop the pictures of Anatol with the samurai so he could relive the moment as often as possible.</p>
        <p>We ended up using one of those pictures as the invitation to his fifth birthday party. That moment -- with his hand on a real samurai sword, posing with three men whose language he could not speak, and the white heron castle looming above them -- may have been a high point of his year, if not his life to date. It was a moment when travel and history and story all came together, and the strange and exotic opened up to include him and welcome him in.</p>
        <p>And it doesn't have to cost a year's salary</p>
        <p>Resources</p>
        <p>The Japan National Tourist Organization's office is at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, Suite 1250, New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 757-5640. It will furnish information and mounds of literature about hotels and transportation.</p>
        <p>We relied heavily on a directory we found at the tourist office put out by the Japanese Inn Group (members.aol.com/jinngroup), whose ryokan are as economical and hospitable as the booklet describes.</p>
        <p>Japan rail passes can be bought only outside Japan by those who hold non-Japanese passports. The passes are available at travel agencies in  the United States; the national tourist organization can provide names of agencies that specialize in Japan.  Vouchers are sold for a one, two, or three-week pass, which is exchanged at a Japan Rail Pass office at a station in Japan. (There also is one at Narita Airport outside Tokyo, if you want to start your pass immediately upon arrival.)</p>
        <p>The passes make train travel in Japan affordable, although the costs change weekly. Last week a one-week pass cost $367 for first class and $275 for coach (by comparison, a round-trip ticket from Tokyo to Hiroshima was $470 first class and $362 coach, and a round trip to Kyoto was $364 first class and $264 coach). A two-week pass cost $594 first class and $438 coach.</p>
        <p>Children ages 6 to 11 travel for half price, with any two children 5 and under riding free if accompanied by an adult. A nongovernment agency that sells passes is the Japan Travel Bureau at 810 Seventh Avenue (between 52nd and 53rd Streets) in Manhattan. It's wise to call in advance on the latest prices (212) 698-4919.</p>

        <p>What to Read</p>
        <p>We carried Frommer's Japan guide (Macmillan, 1998) as well as Lonely Planet's Japan (1997). We also took a pile of Japanese-themed books, some new, most not. In addition to Roland Barthes's ''The Empire of Signs'' (Noonday, 1983) and ''Dave Barry Does Japan'' (Fawcett, 1993), we had several works of history and sociology, but what we really read was fiction, and it added a great deal to the trip. This included James Clavell's ''Shogun'' (Dell, 1976), Arthur S. Golden's ''Memoirs of a Geisha'' (Vintage, 1999), Yukio Mishima's ''The Golden Pavilion'' (Vintage, 1994), and Junichiro Tanizaki's ''The Makioka Sisters'' (Vintage, 1995).</p>
        <p>And, of course we read aloud Anatol's book, ''Sayonara, Mrs. Kackleman'' (Puffin Books, 1991). This beautifully illustrated work by Maira Kalman follows a brother and sister on their trip to Japan (to avoid a piano lesson), and we were all delighted whenever we came across an experience that matched one in the book.</p>
