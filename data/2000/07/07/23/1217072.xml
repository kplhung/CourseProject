        <p>AT first, you notice the balloons. Thousands of them, lining the sides of the road from the airport. Tethered at the end of long strings, they bob and weave, the name Haier emblazoned on each side. Then you notice the road signs, which say Haier Expressway.</p>
        <p>You pass the Haier Industrial Park, with its sprawling factories and a skyscraper with a sign on the roof that also says Haier. Once in Qingdao, there are still more balloons and billboards. A giant lighted Haier sign twinkles from the far side of the city's crescent-shaped bay.</p>
        <p>To pay a call on the local Communist Party boss, you go to the modern city hall, where the lobby has been transformed into a showroom for Haier's refrigerators, dishwashers, personal computers, mobile phones and flat-screen television sets.</p>
        <p>To say that Qingdao is a company town understates the degree to which a single corporation, the Haier Group, has imprinted itself on the landscape. Qingdao may be most famous as the home of Tsingtao beer. But when you spy the brewery's red, green and blue logo on a sign or storefront, it is a bit like finding an image of Deng Xiaoping in a sea of Mao posters.</p>
        <p>Haier's exuberant self-promotion -- even more showy than usual during a recent trade show here -- reflects the ambitions of its chief executive, Zhang Ruimin. In an interview, Mr. Zhang said his determination to put the Haier name everywhere was inspired less by heroic images of Chinese leaders than by the brand marketing practiced by Western corporations.</p>
        <p>''Chinese companies have a problem because the label 'Made in China' means low quality and low price,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''In 1996, we started exporting products under our own brand name. We were told it wouldn't work, but we insisted. Now we're successful with the Haier name all over the world.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Haier Group, a sprawling enterprise ultimately controlled by the city government here, has become China's largest appliance maker, with sales of $3.2 billion last year. It is also one of China's largest exporters, selling $1.4 billion of products in 160 countries. This year, it opened a $30 million refrigerator factory in Camden, S.C. -- becoming one of the few Chinese companies to have an American beachhead.</p>
        <p>MR. ZHANG'S overseas focus might make sense, given the cutthroat price war raging in China. On July 14, one of Haier's main rivals, Guangdong Kelon Electrical Holdings, warned that its first-half profit would be lower than expected because of the price pressure. With deflation still ravaging the Chinese economy, stores are full of unsold appliances.</p>
        <p>But why make fridges in South Carolina when China is much cheaper? Mr. Zhang said he wants Americans to think of Haier as an American company. Designing and making products in the United States, he said, will allow Haier to be more responsive to American consumers.</p>
        <p>''In an era of globalization, you can't separate domestic and international markets,'' Mr. Zhang explained. ''We've got to learn how to compete with General Electric and Whirlpool on their home turf. Otherwise, we'll lose the Chinese market.''</p>
        <p>Such confidence -- not to mention worldliness -- is rare in a Chinese executive. It is even more remarkable from one who spent his career in the parochial confines of the Qingdao municipal government. At 51, Mr. Zhang has become a symbol of how Chinese businessmen can remake themselves to meet the global economy's challenges.</p>
        <p>''I would rank him as the Jack Welch of China,'' said Fred Hu, chief Asian economist for Goldman, Sachs. ''In a country that has been dominated by central planning and state control, he really stands out.''</p>
        <p>T. L. Tsim, a consultant who studies Chinese state enterprises, says marketing like Haier's is crucial to the country's development. ''What China needs today are brand-name products,'' he said. ''It takes years of work and millions of dollars of investment.''</p>
        <p>By creating one of China's first genuine brands, Mr. Zhang himself has become a marquee attraction. He is invited to speak at conferences here and abroad. His views are sought by government officials and journalists. And the story of how he built Haier from the ruins of a state-owned factory has become a legend -- a businessman's equivalent of the Long March.</p>
        <p>The short version: In 1984, Mr. Zhang was asked to run the Qingdao General Refrigerator Factory, a lethargic, nearly bankrupt plant where erratically paid, demoralized workers turned out shoddy products. The Haier name, adopted in 1991, is a Chinese approximation of Liebherr, a German appliance maker that supplied technology to the factory in its early days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zhang was not a likely candidate to produce a turnaround. A bureaucrat who missed out on college because of the Cultural Revolution, he worked his way up the Qingdao hierarchy in anonymity. But he also devoured Western management books, which taught him heretical ideas like the unfairness of paying every worker the same wage, no matter his ability.</p>
        <p>Early in Mr. Zhang's tenure at the company, a customer complained about a broken refrigerator, prompting the boss to stalk through the factory pulling out 76 defective ones. He piled them up and handed sledgehammers to the workers who had assembled them. At his signal, they all set upon the fridges, reducing them to shards.</p>
        <p>That singular act of destruction impressed on employees that poor quality would no longer be acceptable. Mr. Zhang has reinforced the message with an aggressive Western-style quality-control program. ''We cannot expect to smash refrigerators every day,'' he said. ''But actually, I think about doing it every day.''</p>
        <p>Once Mr. Zhang had improved the quality of Haier's products, he set about exporting them to every corner of the world. Starting in developing countries and then to developed markets, Haier now has 62 distributors and 30,000 sales outlets. Its small refrigerators are especially popular in hotel minibars; it has a 25 percent share of the small refrigerator market in the United States.</p>
        <p>Haier says its exports and a diversified  line that runs to 9,000 goods in 42 categories have allowed it to avoid the downdraft in domestic prices that has afflicted its rivals. Because Haier's shares are listed in Shanghai -- where financial disclosure is not as rigorous as in Hong Kong -- analysts say it is difficult for outsiders to assess the impact falling prices have had on Haier's performance. ''It's hard to imagine Haier has escaped it,'' said Charles Cheung, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>HAIER would like to list its shares outside China. But it has put off its plans because of volatile Asian markets and the need to streamline its baffling amalgam of dozens of holding companies and joint ventures.</p>
        <p>When Haier does make its pitch, analysts say, it will have to answer some hard questions. First, why is it building factories overseas? For all of Mr. Zhang's explanations, analysts say that it is squandering its advantage as a low-cost producer.</p>
        <p>Second, why does Haier need a soup-to-nuts product line? Guangdong Kelon makes refrigerators, air-conditioners and washing machines. Mr. Zhang wants to supply every electrical appliance in the household. Doing that while maintaining quality is tricky.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Haier branched into pharmaceuticals. Mr. Zhang did so because he is convinced that biotechnology will be one of the great industries of the 21st century. But he acknowledged that Haier had struggled so far. ''We may fail in that field,'' he said without a hint of defensiveness.</p>
        <p>Risking failure, after all, is the mark of a modern company.</p>
