        <p>WHEN my daughter, Marian, turned 13 in May, I asked her what she wanted for this special birthday. ''Anything within reason,'' I said. She thought about it a bit, then replied, ''I want to see a show on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>That sounded reasonable.</p>
        <p>Then she asked if she could bring a couple of friends. She also wondered if we could go out to dinner before the show. Finally, shortly before the  event, she told my wife that she really didn't have anything appropriate to wear to a night on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Reason went out the window. By the time the evening was over, the birthday party cost about $600. I suppose I should be happy that she didn't ask for a pony.</p>
        <p>Marian has been a teenager for only a couple of months, but I am already wondering what the next few years will be like. After all, while children are undoubtedly expensive to raise, teenagers are the most expensive. Their clothing costs jump, as do their costs for entertainment and, of course, food. Did I mention birthday parties?</p>
        <p>According to recent figures from the Agriculture Department, a family with pretax income of more than $61,900 will spend an average of about $290,000 to raise an only child through age 17, with the heaviest expenses -- $85,000 -- during the teenage years. And that money, of course, just gets parents to the start of the horrific college years.</p>
        <p>''Children have many benefits, but they are expensive,'' said Mark Lino, an economist at the department. ''Teenagers are the most expensive because they are very food-intensive, and they have the highest transportation expenses. These are the years they begin to drive.''</p>
        <p>The average 16-year-old, Mr. Lino said, consumed about $3,000 in food in 1999, compared with about $2,320 for an 8-year-old. When it comes to clothing, he said, parents spent almost $1,300 for the 16-year-old, versus $855 for the 8-year-old.</p>
        <p>Jane Distler, 50, a high school teacher in Shawnee Mission, Kan., said she was amazed at what she spends on her 16-year-old daughter, Kate. ''I wasn't used to paying $60 for a pair of jeans that looked like they were already worn out,'' Ms. Distler said. ''My husband has sticker shock. We spend about $2,400 in clothes a year.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the hobbies. Another mom from Kansas, who asked that her name not be used, said she had spent about $5,000 on fencing lessons, equipment and trips for her 18-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>''You take them shopping once a week and you get a little outfit,'' this mom said. ''Then there's the video and DVD rentals, about $15 a week. That adds up. We keep telling ourselves that we would be rich if we hadn't had kids.</p>
        <p>''Some weeks it can be overwhelming,'' she said. ''Like the prom: that was a lot of money. You think it's not going to be a big deal, and it snowballs.'' She said the total bill for prom night was about $570.</p>
        <p>Karin Humbolt, the author of ''I Want to Be Rich: A Teenager's Modem to Money'' (Reynolds Publishing, 1998), says there are ways to mitigate the costs. For one, she said, parents should get their teenagers financially involved in the family. She said a child who works or gets an allowance should be encouraged to chip in, maybe by paying for entertainment expenses. The children  should also understand where the family's money is coming from and what it takes to support them.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they realize what it takes to get up day after day, punch that time clock and deal with work,'' Ms. Humbolt said. ''Tell them how much it does cost to support the family. The child will be able to relate to that, and understand why he won't be able to afford that $100 pair of Nikes.''</p>
        <p>I think that is why my daughter understands that we're not sending her to boarding school in Europe for the eighth grade. That surprising request came soon after the Broadway trip. She wanted an adventure, she said, and being an ''A'' student in Spanish, wanted to immerse herself in another language.</p>
        <p>A commendable request, and I admire her maturity, but the school she had picked out, in Switzerland, costs $35,000 a year.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how people are doing it, because it's such a struggle and it's so expensive to raise a teenager today,'' Ms. Humbolt said. ''Parents really have to plan. It takes a fortune and six credit cards.''</p>
        <p>I wonder if Marian would settle for a pony.</p>
