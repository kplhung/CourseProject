        <p>THERE are already 311, 411, 611, 711, 811 and 911 numbers.</p>
        <p>Next in line could be 211 -- if the state's Public Service Commission approves it for callers in need of health and information referral services. It's in use for that reason in nine states.</p>
        <p>If approved in New York, residents in Westchester and surrounding counties will be among the first in the state to test 211 for getting help for, among other groups, teenagers in crisis, addicts in need of rehabilitation, people looking for nursing homes for elderly parents, disabled people and victims of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>There is also a national effort -- involving the United Way of America, the national Alliance of Information and Referral Systems and other groups -- to have 211 reserved as a number for health and human services referrals. The Federal Communications Commission is expected to rule on the petition for 211 later this month, along with an application from the federal Department of Transportation to use 511 as its emergency number.</p>
        <p>But even if the F.C.C. does not approve 211 nationally, states and municipalities can adopt it, as Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Alabama, North Carolina and Utah have done. Also, 211 numbers are operative in Atlanta and elsewhere in Georgia, in Knox County, Tenn., and in Lafayette, La.</p>
        <p>For those who might not be sure what all these purportedly easy-to-remember numbers connect dialers to, here is a quick rundown: for nonemergency police and municipal services (like cats caught in trees or broken water mains), call 311; for local and national phone number information, call 411; local phone companies use 611 and 811 for repair and other services; 711 is for the deaf and hard of hearing; and 911 is for police and medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>Officials in places that are using 211 say it has stopped a deluge of inappropriate calls to 911; in Chengo County, near Ithaca, for example, officials say that 20 percent of the calls to 911 do not involve emergencies.</p>
        <p>''It will relieve problems,'' said Linda S. Daily, executive director of the White Plains-based Family Information and Referral Teams, who has met with members of the state's Public Service Commission. If the commission approves the number, 211 will be put into effect in several demonstration projects during the next two years at a cost of about $800,000.</p>
        <p>Ralph A. Gregory, president and chief executive officer of United Way of Westchester and Putnam, said the state would create eight or nine 211 regions. Besides the Taconic region (which includes Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Sullivan and Ulster Counties), he said the Greater Buffalo and Greater Rochester areas would take part in the trials.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week 211 service would expand on a help line that has been run by United Way for 12 years. Managed jointly by the county's Office for the Aging, First, the Childcare Council of Westchester, Westchester Residential Opportunities, the Mental Health Association of Westchester and United Way, the help line (949-4636) is staffed only Mondays through Fridays from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>To pay for the cost of 211 services and the technology it would entail to cross-reference all the health and social services available, the United Way and other groups are seeking corporate grants, government financing and money from the communities. United Way is expected to cover most of the costs.</p>
        <p>While 911 service is paid for with a tax levy on phone bills, ''We're not going that route,'' Mr. Gregory said. ''We don't think the phone companies or the customers will buy that.'' In Connecticut, most costs are covered by the state. In Atlanta, United Way pays for most of the service. In New York, Mr. Gregory said United Way is looking for support from a variety of sources.</p>
