        <p>After more than two years of attacks on its methods, financing and leadership, the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the State University of New York at Stony Brook is shutting its doors.</p>
        <p>The clinic opened in January 1998 as the first such center in the SUNY system, offering such treatments as acupuncture and massage therapy integrated with Western medicine. Some critics argued that alternative medicine has not been proved scientifically and should not be offered at a state university. Others questioned the process of giving credentials to practitioners or challenged the center's $1 million budget.</p>
        <p>But budgetary concerns were the only ones cited by Dr. George Tyson, vice president for health sciences at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>''Over the past 24 months, budget constraints within the SUNY system have forced the university to make difficult decisions with regard to program priorities,'' he said. ''The Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was one of a number of programs targeted for restructuring.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Tyson denied that the other criticisms had been factors.</p>
        <p>''Opponents of the program had their say and were satisfied that their voices had been heard,'' he said. ''While we have decided that having a center is not the best way of offering services at this time, restructuring to better offer complementary medicine is still definitely on our agenda.''</p>
