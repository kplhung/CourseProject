        <p>ONE of Aaron Moses Gooday-Ervin's favorite sayings is: ''You can take the boy out of the land, but you can't take the land out of the boy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gooday-Ervin spent the first weeks of his life in a wickiup, a traditional shelter made of sticks and surrounded by pine trees and sagebrush on the Fort Apache Reservation in northeastern Arizona.

Wilma and Don Ervin, his adoptive parents, brought him to a very different land: New Canaan, Conn.</p>

        <p>ONE of Aaron Moses Gooday-Ervin's favorite sayings is: ''You can take the boy out of the land, but you can't take the land out of the boy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gooday-Ervin spent the first weeks of his life in a wickiup, a traditional shelter made of sticks and surrounded by pine trees and sagebrush on the Fort Apache Reservation in northeastern Arizona. His parents, Nieman and Gladys Gooday, White Mountain Apaches, were in poor health and struggling financially and soon gave him up for adoption. Wilma and Don Ervin, his adoptive parents, brought him to a very different land: New Canaan, Conn.</p>
        <p>Growing up, he adjusted to New Canaan, but some discomfort lingered. ''I just didn't fit in,'' said Mr. Gooday-Ervin, who is now 33. ''I did things that were individual, like biking alone or painting.''</p>
        <p>In his early 20's, he began thinking about reuniting with his biological family, whose names and whereabouts he learned from his adoptive parents. ''It all started for me with dreams -- of animals, of ancestors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1992, he set out for Fort Apache. One of the first people he encountered on the reservation, he recalled, was an old man who said to him, ''You look like you belong to Nieman and Gladys, but they've passed on.'' But he found two sisters, Stephanie and Renada, and many aunts, uncles and cousins. They welcomed him back with gifts of turquoise jewelry and blankets. ''Tears were coming out of their eyes, out of my eyes,'' he remembered.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has immersed himself in Native American life. In 1995, while living near the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in central Connecticut, he began attending powwows and other tribal events. He eventually got a job in the community center on the reservation, where he met Toni-Ellen Weeden, who is also known as Sowwani, which means southwest wind.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weeden, now 42, whom friends describe as gentle and consistent as the southwest wind, has been divorced once and has two children. She grew up following many Native American ways, from dances to healing cuts with Indian hemp gathered outside the home of her father, Everett Weeden Jr. of Charlestown, R.I., who is of Mashantucket Pequot and Wampanoag descent and is known as Tall Oak. Her mother, Judith Wesley, a Brazilian-Cape Verdean lives in East Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gooday-Ervin began dating Ms. Weeden in 1997. He had been married, but that marriage had ended not long before. At the time, he was working at the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, in Mashantucket, Conn., where he is now the public relations specialist and she is the assistant education manager.</p>
        <p>Recalling their courtship, Ms. Weeden said she knew she wanted to marry him after three months. Mr. Gooday-Ervin said he knew when he first took her back to Fort Apache. ''As a Native person, I look for signs from the environment,'' he said. ''Sometimes a bird will come out of nowhere or the wind will pick up. When Toni and I went home to the reservation, we were driving and all of a sudden this bald eagle appeared and started circling us. I come from the eagle clan and I saw that as a sign from my ancestors saying, 'Toni is a good person, don't ever lose her.' ''</p>
        <p>On July 16, the couple were married in a traditional ceremony on a grass lawn outside the museum, under a turquoise sky. The bride arrived in a long, fringed deerskin dress decorated with strings of deer toes that clattered as she walked. She also wore a cape she made from wild turkey feathers. ''The Pequots would make nice things out of the feathers as a way of honoring the animal they had to eat,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom wore a purple shirt the color of wampum beads, an off-white coarse cotton apron over shorts and buckskin boots the color of dried corn kernels.</p>
        <p>The ceremony was quiet, filled with acts, not words. Once, the couple wrapped themselves in a blanket, symbolically promising to keep each other warm. They also exchanged baskets. ''His basket is filled with corn bread,'' Trudy Lamb Richmond, a friend, said. ''Her basket contains cloth because part of her responsibility is clothing the family. We're really saying that you are two parts of a whole, you've created your own circle. Native people look at everything in the world as circular: birth and death, the seasons.''</p>
        <p>The bride's relatives were almost all clad in buckskin regalia and were fanning feathers to keep themselves cool. The bridegroom's side included the Ervins as well as relatives from Fort Apache. ''It's come full circle,'' Kirsten Ervin, a sister, said. ''You can't replace knowing where you came from and having a connection to it.''</p>
        <p>A few days afterward, the bride's father said: ''When we named Toni Southwest Wind, we never had any idea that the southwest wind would blow the wonderful gift of Aaron into her life. Aaron comes from the Southwest, the direction most sacred to us, where the Creator lives.''</p>
