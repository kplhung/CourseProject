      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Everything about William Monahan's assured first novel, LIGHT HOUSE: A Trifle (Riverhead, $21.95), is tremendously knowing. Tim Picasso -- the beautiful, brilliant, insipid hero -- has become a drug runner because he is too talented and uncompromising to make it in the commercial art world. A brief life of crime ensues; Picasso steals from the wrong man, a gangster named Jesus Castro, and then hides out at the Admiral Benbow Inn off the coast of Massachusetts. We meet a satisfyingly ridiculous cast of characters, including Prof. Menelaus G. Eggman, who is ''flickering at the edge of literary relevancy'' and holding a writing seminar, and a bitter, failed writer named Glowery (''the sort of damaged marginal that the magazines troll for in catch-and-release experiments'') who is en route but gets stuck in a bar dressed as a pirate. The fantastically inarticulate Jesus Castro shows up, followed by a dominatrix and some henchmen, while a crusty old New Englander tries to escape the house of the title. ''Light House'' is a sort of old English farce that allows Monahan, formerly an editor at Spy magazine, to skewer whatever comes to mind: modern art, magazine writing, education, the young. But the setting is pervasive and rendered with immediacy. The book is also very funny, and Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along. ''Lighthouse'' is an antidote to everything it rails against.</p>
