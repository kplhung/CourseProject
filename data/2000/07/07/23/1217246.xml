        <p>The United States plans to lend up to $1 billion annually to sub-Saharan African nations where AIDS and H.I.V. afflict 25 million people. The American loans, which will carry commercial interest rates, can be used only to buy American-produced drugs, equipment or medical services. Officials expect Japan and Europe to make similar amounts available to support their medical exports.</p>
