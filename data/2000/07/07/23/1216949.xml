        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anita Gates's article on the Satellite Sisters [''Eavesdropping on a Kaffeeklatsch of the Air,'' July 9] accepts that the concerns and experiences of these women are at least somewhat universal: mud bath spas in California, Lancome makeovers, how best to ship a gravy boat to Thailand, even living somewhere like Greenwich Village, for that matter. Public radio is seen by many as radio by and for the relatively wealthy and the extremely white, and as represented in the article the sisters almost constitute a parody of the stereotypical public radio demographic. However good the show may be, it's worth mentioning that in the big picture, it's likely more of a niche offering than the creators or Ms. Gates would acknowledge.</p>
