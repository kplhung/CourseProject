        <p>Re ''Soaking the Rich Isn't What It Used To Be'' (Week in Review, July 16):</p>
        <p>You perpetuate a dangerous myth that the estate tax somehow is unique in constituting ''double taxation.'' In fact, every dollar is taxed an infinite amount of times as it circulates through the economy. I pay payroll and income tax on an earned dollar, sales taxes when I spend it and tax on interest earned when I put it in a savings account. When I buy a compact disc, the store, the manufacturer and the store clerk are all taxed on it.</p>

        <p>Wealthy people pay zero percent on unrealized capital gains (if they have no need to sell their stock portfolios), and 98 percent of estates pay a zero percent rate, so in most cases the wealthy pay zero percent on their money. In most cases, income that is unearned is taxed at a much lower rate than income that is earned by the sweat of one's brow.</p>
