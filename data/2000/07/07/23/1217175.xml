        <p>WALK into a department store these days and you can buy a holster for a cellular phone that looks just like a holster for a snub-nosed pistol. Visit a consumer electronics store and you'll find that the computers are no longer boxy and cheery-looking but dark, sleek and faintly menacing. Stop at an auto dealership and there will be an array of tall sport utility vehicles designed to intimidate other motorists.</p>
        <p>Designers of a wide variety of consumer products say that the American public is increasingly entranced by styling that suggests a high level of aggression. They point to the popularity of black, red and white as colors, the prevalence of crisp, even sharp, edges for many products, and a declining emphasis on personal comfort in everything from furniture to clothing.</p>
        <p>''It's sort of like 'sex sells' -- in this case, violence sells,'' said William Stumpf, a Minneapolis-based designer best known as the inventor of the Aeron chair. ''There's a meanness aesthetic being developed.''</p>
        <p>Bruce R. Hannah, a professor of industrial design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, said his young design students were particularly captivated by ideas that emphasized rawness and even pain over comfort. One student, for example, was interested in spiky jewelry that would be painful to wear and light switches with sharp edges. And Mr. Hannah sees the same extremism at work in young people's fashion. ''There are these big, black, chunky almost storm-trooper shoes and crisp trousers; there isn't the rumpled look of the 60's and 70's,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some older designers complain that there is little on the market that they want to buy. Clyde Foles, the 56-year-old chairman of the industrial design department at the Center for Creative Studies, a design institute in Detroit, said he had been unable to find a radio for his summer cottage because the clean, rectangular, Bauhaus-style designs he was looking for had given way to alarming combinations of curves and sharp edges. The prevalent design these days, ''looks like Darth Vader's helmet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Where this aggression is coming from is a mystery. Designers and market researchers most commonly cite video games, with their emphasis on violence and exotic yet menacing shapes for androids, space aliens and other threats. Others point to Jung's observation that people behave worse when times are better, and suggest that the end of the cold war and the nation's economic boom have left Americans freer to explore their deepest psychological feelings, including the fear of violence.</p>
        <p>Some designers single out the wealth of research showing that Americans remain very much afraid of crime, even though crime has actually fallen. Federal crime surveys show that violent crime dropped 22.7 percent between 1993 and 1998. Rates for other crimes have fallen even more sharply, including a 43.2 percent plunge in motor vehicle thefts. But Gallup polls since 1989 have consistently found that a majority of Americans believe that crime is worsening, although the size of that majority has shrunk over the last decade.</p>
        <p>The trend toward playing on fears of crime is most noticeable in transportation products, Mr. Stumpf said. Powerboats are now often low, lethal-looking craft influenced by the stealth fighter's design. Bicycles have studded, off-road tires instead of racing tires. Skateboards have images of fire-breathing dragons instead of racing stripes. And tall, large sport utility vehicles have replaced sleek, low sports cars as the favorite choice of image-conscious buyers.</p>
        <p>Archetype Discoveries Worldwide, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., does psychological consumer researcher for many large clients, including Seagram, Procter &amp; Gamble, DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors. Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, the company's founder and chairman, contends that the United States is in some ways becoming a medieval society, in which people live and work in the modern equivalent of castles -- gated communities, apartment buildings with doormen and office buildings with guards -- and try to shield themselves while traveling between them. They do this by riding in sport utility vehicles, which look armored, and by trying to appear as intimidating as possible to potential attackers.</p>
        <p>In a recent study for Ford, for example, Dr. Rapaille concluded that ''bigger is better'' by itself was not enough for sport utility vehicles. The reason the immense Ford Excursion, which is the world's largest S.U.V., was not selling well, Dr. Rapaille said, was that it didn't look menacing enough. ''It's like a big, fat elephant that's a little dumb,'' he said.</p>
        <p>DR. Rapaille has also been involved in the design and advertising of Chrysler's PT Cruiser, an extraordinarily popular new model that combines a minivan with a 1930's gangster-movie roadster. Customers perceive it as ''Al Capone's car,'' Dr. Rapaille said approvingly. ''The message this car gives is: 'Don't mess with me. I might have a machine gun inside.' ''</p>
        <p>This kind of research, which has revealed the consumer's desire for aggressive products, has also contributed to tension between auto marketing executives and safety engineers. The safety engineers worry that tall sport utility vehicles are more likely to roll over, more likely to override the bumpers and doorsills of lower-riding cars and more likely to blind other drivers with high-mounted headlights.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rapaille, incidentally, only half exemplifies the results of his research. While he lives in a gated community outside New York, nary a bulked-up S.U.V. is to be found in his garage. He owns instead two Rolls-Royces and a Porsche, partly because he worries more about the danger of rolling over in a tall vehicle than he does about carnaping.</p>
        <p>Americans may consciously or unconsciously fear crime when they go for a drive, Dr. Rapaille said, but ''this is definitely not the reality, it is the perception.''</p>
