        <p>In their fight against late-night revelers, residents of West 14th Street are preparing to use a drastic measure: taking away the parking.</p>
        <p>Risking the wrath of Manhattan car owners, some favor a plan to ban overnight parking on weekends.  They say the crowds drawn to a  thriving bar and club scene between Seventh and Eighth Avenues honk  horns, blast car stereos and congregate noisily in parked cars in front of the clubs.</p>
        <p>Michael Munsie, a 30-year resident of West 14th Street, said entrepreneurs had illegally blocked off and sold parking spaces at Eighth Avenue, and that their huckstering just added to the late-night din.</p>
        <p>''Trucks, cars, people screaming and yelling at each other because they don't know how to talk in a normal tone of voice,'' said Mr. Munsie, describing the weekend scene. ''You really have to hide behind the air-conditioner in order to get any sleep.''</p>
        <p>He added that on weekend nights, ''idealistically, I'd like to see no parking from river to river.'' As a beginning, he said, a good idea would be to ban it from Seventh Avenue to the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>A parking ban on 14th Street first came up at a forum in May held to address a surge in nightspot-related problems in the last 18 months. Some residents fear the problem will get worse as bars and nightclubs continue to open in the meat market district between Ninth and 11th Avenues. Some people favor closing just a few parking spots near Eighth Avenue, while others, like Mr. Munsie, prefer a severer solution.</p>
        <p>On Eighth Street, in the West Village, nighttime parking is forbidden. On weekend nights, the police occasionally block the to the street at the Avenue of the Americas to all vehicular traffic.</p>
        <p>Steve Hirschhorn, co-owner of 2is, a nightclub near Eighth Avenue, said he supported anything the residents wanted.</p>
        <p>''I'm for anything that helps whatever goes on out there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The 14th Street Special Committee will hold a hearing on the proposed ban Tuesday, and Community Board 4 is expected to take up the issue Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mark Patterson, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation, responsible for any change in parking regulations, said the agency would meet with neighborhood leaders once the community board made a  proposal.</p>
        <p>But some think taking away precious parking goes too far. James DePesa, the doorman at the Sequoia apartment building halfway between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, said the problem was the clubs and the noisy people that gather in front of them.</p>
        <p>''We got people in the building that need that parking,'' he said.</p>
