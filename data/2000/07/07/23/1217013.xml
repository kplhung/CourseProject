        <p>A long-dormant plan to build a Home Depot in Mount Pleasant has been given new life since Justice W. Denis Donovan of State Supreme Court in White Plains held that town planners wrongly rejected the company's proposal on environmental grounds. ''The project has been revived,'' said Paul D. Sirignano, a lawyer for Home Depot. He said the company had invested $3 million since 1993 trying to build on Route 9. The town Planning Board denied the company a site plan and freshwater wetlands permit, but the judge on July 11 said that ruling was arbitrary and capricious. The matter has been sent back to the Planning Board, but William Agresta, the town's outside planning consultant, said that in his opinion, ''the board reached an appropriate decision in denying the applications.''</p>
