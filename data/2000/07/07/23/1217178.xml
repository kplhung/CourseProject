        <p>Shortly after moving to this military town in Okinawa two years ago, Etsuko Higashiyama, a 29-year-old secretary, fell in love with a United States marine from Arkansas. They dated for more than a year, and when Ms. Higashiyama became pregnant, the couple considered marriage, she said.</p>
        <p>But the marine, who finished his tour of duty in Okinawa last December, left without warning for the United States, leaving Ms. Higashiyama to raise their daughter -- now 7 months old -- alone in a country that is not always charitable to children of mixed parentage.</p>
        <p>''The last contact I had with him was by e-mail when I informed him that I had given birth to a girl,'' Ms. Higashiyama said. ''He didn't respond. I don't think he wanted to know.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, there was little that Ms. Higashiyama or thousands of other abandoned Okinawan women and children could do about this predicament. United States servicemen left the island with no reprisals, and there was no agreement in force between Japan and the United States to make them pay child support.</p>
        <p>Now, Annette Eddie-Callagain has taken up the cause of the Japanese women whose desperate faces, she said, came to haunt her when she was a United States Air Force lawyer stationed in Okinawa 10 years ago. Large numbers of women came to her for help in obtaining child support from American servicemen, but she had little recourse.</p>
        <p>''All I could do is write to the base commander, who, if he chose to, would hunt down the serviceman and convince him to assume his responsibilities,'' she said. ''But after a few months of payments, the child support usually stopped.''</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Ms. Eddie-Callagain returned to Okinawa and opened a private law practice where she is waging her own private war on deadbeat military dads.</p>
        <p>So far, she has filed cases on behalf of 50 Okinawan women, including Ms. Higashiyama, who are seeking child support from men who have returned to the United States.</p>
        <p>Social service agencies and children's rights advocates estimate that there are about 4,000 Okinawan children abandoned by American servicemen.</p>
        <p>Many single mothers have not heard from their husbands or boyfriends for months, if not years, and cannot afford to raise their children alone, the advocates said. In some cases, the women face eviction because they lack rent money. Many of the women no longer qualify for, nor can they afford to send their children to, racially mixed military and Christian schools. So their children go to Japanese schools, where they are often bullied and many drop out.</p>
        <p>''You can't imagine the physical and emotional trauma that these Okinawan women and their children suffer when these United States servicemen desert them,'' said Naomi Noiri, a professor of law at the University of the Ryukus in Okinawa. ''They fall between the cracks in our society because there are no legal or social mechanisms in Japan or the United States to provide for them.''</p>
        <p>The United States has signed reciprocal agreements with countries like Germany, Sweden and Britain to enable the mother of a child whose father has returned to his homeland to seek financial support with the help of government authorities. But no such pact exists with Japan.</p>
        <p>There are about 22,000 United States military personnel stationed in Okinawa prefecture, and the local government estimates that about 200 Amerasian children are born in Okinawa annually.</p>
        <p>In the past week, in the run-up to the annual meeting of the world's largest industrialized nations in Okinawa, the Japanese media have reported widely on the racial discrimination, poor education and financial distress that many of these biracial children endure in Japanese society. The news reports have characterized the plight of the Amerasian children as yet another example of the social ills caused by the many United States military bases in Okinawa -- not exactly the tone the Japanese government was seeking when it decided to hold the meeting here, putting one of the country's poorest regions in the spotlight.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of a bilateral agreement with Japan regarding child support, Ms. Eddie-Callagain is taking her clients' cases directly to the child enforcement offices in each of the 50 state governments in the United States. She is trying to convince states where the deadbeat fathers reside to prosecute them in family court.</p>
        <p>Ms. Eddie-Callagain said she won her first case in March 1999 when Illinois began docking the wages of a former United States serviceman to provide financial support for his two children in Okinawa.</p>
        <p>And the crusading lawyer's office is now authorized to collect DNA samples to establish paternity in the event that accused men claim they are not the fathers.</p>
        <p>In addition to their battle for child support, Okinawan mothers of Amerasian children are demanding better education, free of the abuse the children often suffer in Japanese public schools, which are notorious for bullying children who do not fit in.</p>
        <p>But the Japanese and United States governments have so far ignored the mothers' pleas for better schooling. Two years ago, a group of mothers took matters into their own hands and turned a rented two-story house here into the country's first school for Amerasian children.</p>
        <p>Midori Thayer, principal of the AmerAsian School in Okinawa, said the fledgling institution provided a nurturing atmosphere where children could learn in both English and Japanese and did not have to feel ashamed of their dual backgrounds. Her three biracial children, whose father had abandoned them, were among the first pupils. About 70 percent of the school's 40 students come from single-parent homes.</p>
        <p>It has been a struggle keeping the school running. It receives no support from the United States or Japan, and there are only a few private donors. Parents often find the $250 monthly tuition a bit steep. Ms. Thayer buys old textbooks at garage sales and begs Japanese schools for old desks and other furniture. She is seeking donations and financing from international aid organizations to move the school to a larger building where she can accommodate dozens of students on a waiting list.</p>
        <p>For 12-year-old Arisa Garrison, who is of mixed race, attending Tomishiro Elementary, a Japanese school here, was sheer torture. Her classmates called her ''half'' -- a racial epithet -- and ridiculed her because she did not speak English well, although she looked American. Many Amerasian children speak poor English because Japanese is the primary language at home.</p>
        <p>At the Japanese school, Arisa often found tacks in her shoes or nasty notes that said she was stupid and should go back to America. ''I hated going there,'' she said of her two years at Tomishiro. ''I was bullied almost every day. I missed many days of school because I was so sad.''</p>
        <p>Since transferring to the Amerasian school three months ago, Arisa has not missed a day and is inseparable from her new friend, 13-year-old Nicky Miyagi. ''She's easy for me to talk to because she knows exactly how I feel,'' Arisa said. ''At my old school, I felt like I was on a hostile planet.''</p>
