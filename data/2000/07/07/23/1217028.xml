        <p>The prison sentence for a Vineland man was reduced last week to 7 years from 12 years to conform with a recent ruling by the United States Supreme that overturned New Jersey's 1981 bias crime law. Charles Apprendi, who had shot at the home of the only black family in his Vineland neighborhood, had pled guilty to three weapons charges and his sentence was extendedby Superior Court Judge Rushton Ridgway, who decided the crime was motivated by bias. The Supreme Court ruled that only a jury, not a judge, should decide motivation, as New Jersey allowed, and that Mr. Apprendi's sentence had to be reduced.</p>
