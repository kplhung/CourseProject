        <p>GERTRUDE JEKYLL may be the Elvis of the gardening world. Dead since 1932, her presence is everywhere. Gardeners from Trenton to Tokyo speak her name in reverent tones, and make pilgrimages to Munstead, her English home. A pair of her gardening boots is even enshrined in the Museum of Garden History in London.</p>
        <p>My gardening shoes will never be enshrined anywhere, with the possible exception of a forgotten corner of my cellar, but I count myself among those who feel indebted to the great garden designer. Born in the 19th century, she was a product of her era's do-it-yourself trend, the Arts and Crafts Movement.</p>
        <p>When failing eyesight forced her to curtail her career as an artist and embroiderer, she turned to garden design and set about turning it in a new direction. Rejecting the elaborate and labor-intensive bedding plans beloved by the Victorians, she designed gardens that were like Impressionist canvases painted with an array of perennial plants.</p>
        <p>Her trademark long borders went from one end of the spectrum to the other, with colors flowing into each other seamlessly.</p>
        <p>All gardens are triumphs of artifice, but unlike other designers, Ms. Jekyll made hers seem more accessible. Her design plans and old-fashioned plant selections worked in  small yards and on great estates as well, and that is what fixed her place in the horticultural pantheon.</p>
        <p>Americans in search of Gertrude Jekyll's legacy can find it everywhere. Any designer who creates old-fashioned flower gardens has probably taken a page or two from her book. But if you want to see an actual Jekyll garden in the United States, there is only one place to go, and that is Glebe House in Woodbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>Glebe House, a frame building constructed around 1750, is significant as the birthplace of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States. It was rescued from demolition in the 1920's by women who founded a nonprofit organization, bought the structure and opened it as a house museum. One of those women, Anna Burr Jennings, also commissioned the elderly Ms. Jekyll to design a garden for the property.</p>
        <p>The garden was never installed, and the plans were lost until 1982 when a researcher discovered them at the University of California at Berkeley. The celebrated American garden designer, Beatrix Farrand, had apparently bought several of Ms. Jekyll's plans, and willed them, along with other papers, to the university. In 1987, installation of the garden finally began at Glebe House.</p>
        <p>For those used to the lush illustrations of garden magazines, and the abundance of estates like Longwood, the Glebe House garden might be disappointing. Billed as a ''600-foot perennial border,'' the beds run along three sides of the perimeter of the structure's lawn, making them seem considerably less grand.</p>
        <p>The garden is full of Jekyll-trademark old-fashioned plants -- pinks, phlox, dahlias, lemon lilies -- but in mid-June, when I visited, some of the flashiest had just finished flowering. Only random petals remained on the roses. A few peonies were left, but the irises were finished for the year, and the hollyhocks were still waiting in the wings. Many of the annuals were saving their splendor for later in the summer.</p>
        <p>Still, the New Dawn rose was blooming its heart out on the arbor that formed part of the rose allee, with a sky-blue clematis lounging at its feet. Lavender and chives blossomed in the neat herb bed, and in the shady part of the garden, hellebores still bore flowers.</p>
        <p>When Glebe House was built in the 18th century, it probably had little more than a kitchen garden that produced vegetables, fruit and medicinal herbs. After the Jekyll plan was discovered, the Glebe House board had to decide whether it was historically and aesthetically appropriate to install an early 20th-century garden around an 18th-century house.</p>
        <p>The lesson of Glebe House is that unless you are a stickler for historical accuracy, this juxtaposition of two eras is not jarring at all. The garden and the structure seem compatible, and while there are no cabbages or carrots in the beds, there are many plants -- like lavender, pot marigold, tansy, dame's rocket and viola -- that might have been grown by early Americans.</p>
        <p>I find it interesting that Glebe House is a piece of history that was rescued by women. Anna Burr Jenkins and her group saved the structure from demolition. Sixty years later, Gertrude Jekyll reached out from the grave, and, with a little help from her admirers, saved it from being just another small house museum.</p>
        <p>THIS WEEK  Finding a Garden In the Jekyll Spirit</p>
        <p>For further information on some of the most enchanting Jekyll gardens, try Lost Gardens of Gertrude Jekyll by Fenja Gunn (Macmillan, 1991). After extensive research the author, an English watercolorist, created portraits of 20 Jekyll gardens that were never installed or have been lost through neglect.</p>
        <p>The author included plant lists and samples of color combinations, making it possible for anyone with access to a seed catalog or garden center to recreate at least a small piece of a Gertrude Jekyll garden.</p>
        <p>Glebe House Museum and The Gertrude Jekyll Garden are in Woodbury, Conn., and are open April through November. For more information and directions to the house and garden, call (203) 263-2855.</p>
