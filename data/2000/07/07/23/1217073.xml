        <p>A DELUGED New York is the theme of the photo installation by Ana Marton that is on view at the Pratt Institute. Titled ''Immersion,'' her work, like the piece at left, interweaves photographic interpretations of the rain-soaked city streets with movie stills and overlaid text messages. The still photographs and the words that accompany them are positioned in midair behind a translucent screen, seeking to create the appearance of a dream sequence in which viewers participate.</p>
