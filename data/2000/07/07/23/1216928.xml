        <p>SOMETIMES, in a busy life, the need to make art wells up unexpectedly and turns that life around. There is no way to predict the onset of this condition, nor is there any known cure. It can strike anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p>In a cellar in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Robert Parker meticulously fashioned champagne cork wire, matchsticks, old fuses, coins and bits of plastic and metal into tiny, glittering chairs. He built mysterious wooden boxes, too. ''Do You See Your Own Shadow When You Dream?'' asked one. Inside were more little objects: a chess knight, a leprechaun, stamps, an ear of corn. ''In a dream an ear of corn could dance,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>

        <p>SOMETIMES, in a busy life, the need to make art wells up unexpectedly and turns that life around. There is no way to predict the onset of this condition, nor is there any known cure. It can strike anyone, anywhere.</p>
        <p>In a cellar in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., Robert Parker meticulously fashioned champagne cork wire, matchsticks, old fuses, coins and bits of plastic and metal into tiny, glittering chairs. He built mysterious wooden boxes, too. ''Do You See Your Own Shadow When You Dream?'' asked one. Inside were more little objects: a chess knight, a leprechaun, stamps, an ear of corn. ''In a dream an ear of corn could dance,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>In an attic in Newark, Robert Bonanno bathed the tips of Crayolas in the low flame from a propane torch. Patiently he guided the melting wax, bead by dripping bead, onto a square of thin plywood, creating oddly shaped puddles of pure color in a mazelike design. ''I'm 42 and still playing with crayons,'' he cheerfully admitted.</p>
        <p>In a garage in Oceanside, N.Y., Paul Livert bolted tag-sale finds -- chandelier parts, candlestick holders, used hardware, oil burner nozzles -- onto bowling balls, turning them into striking pop-eyed creatures. His workspace was cluttered with enough old balls to start a league and heaps of future body parts. ''If you run out of potential eyes,'' he said gravely, ''you're dead.''</p>
        <p>In a house in New Haven, Winfred Rembert tooled into leather the stories of his life: his near-lynching; his stint on a chain gang; the characters of his Georgia youth -- Papa Screwball, Raincoat Red, Bubba Duke and the rest. He had so many memories, Mr. Rembert fretted, and not enough time. ''I'll probably be dead and in my grave before all this stuff is done,'' he said. ''I'll never get it done.''</p>
        <p>Four individualists with one unforeseen life-changing compulsion: to declare themselves through art. And so they have, without formal training and with apparent success. ''What is art?'' is a question that is endlessly arguable, but all four have been invited to exhibit in galleries, and some of Mr. Livert's bowling balls have even been displayed in a world-class art museum, albeit in the restrooms.</p>
        <p>Being self-taught artists hasn't hurt the four, either. Art may disdain labels, but in marketing, labels matter, and ''self-taught'' beckons dealers, collectors and the media with the prospect of fresh and possibly eccentric talent.</p>
        <p>''Self-taught,'' ''outsider,'' ''visionary,'' ''folk'' -- these terms are often used interchangeably. ''There are no rigid definitions,'' said Joseph Jacobs, the curator of American art at the Newark Museum. ''It's a mess.'' Still, purists valiantly draw distinctions among the terms.</p>
        <p>''Outsider'' used to refer to self-taught artists who lived apart from society or in worlds of their own -- like hermits, psychic mediums and the insane -- and who created art obsessively without realizing, or caring, that it was art. Now ''outsider'' is sometimes casually applied to any self-taught artist working off the radar of the mainstream art world.</p>
        <p>''It just got all garbled up in its application in America,'' said Lee Kogan, the director of the Folk Art Institute at the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan and a proponent of ''self-taught.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca Hoffberger, the founder and director of the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, said ''visionary'' sidestepped the hair-splitting discussions about in-ness and out-ness that ''outsider'' provoked. ''I have to listen to all these academicians,'' she said, ''who go, 'Oooh, is it outsider or is it insider?' 'Oooh, are they outside the mainstream or have they been corrupted now because they went to a museum and saw something else?' And it's a very boring discussion.''</p>
        <p>As for ''folk,'' a common-sense interpretation of the term would be art made by regular, well, folk. But Ms. Hoffberger said folk art arises out of an established tradition, while visionary art is one person's heartfelt cry to the world. ''Usually they've just had a life experience which is just so overwhelming, through joy or through pain, that there are no words for it and it just starts coming out as art,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The label ''self-taught'' does not imply emotional turmoil; Mr. Bonanno, for one, said his crayon art was ''just examples of techniques.'' But for him and for other self-taught artists in the region, Ms. Hoffberger's words about the visionary are apt: ''They have the conviction of their own taste. They haven't been poured through a filter of rules. So they come from a foundation of openness to possibility.''</p>
        <p>Car Parts Turned Sculpture</p>
        <p>By his own account, Joe DeMarco hated school, behaved badly, and crashed dozens of cars in his restless, reckless youth. He survived; decades passed; for a while he found success in real estate. Now, married for the third time and with three grown sons, Mr. DeMarco rises at 4:30 a.m. and labors until twilight at his home in rural Fairfield County, transforming junked car parts into sculptures. The car gods must be smiling; Mr. DeMarco certainly is. Becoming an artist, he said, transformed his life, too.</p>
        <p>About five years ago he said he discovered that partners had defrauded him in a real estate deal. He contemplated retaliation: ''I was ready to get myself in trouble.'' Instead he took out his frustration on the rims of car wheels, cutting, bending and welding them into quirky human figures. Soon he was using other cast-offs in his art: smelter ladles encrusted with slag, fireplace pipes, brass turnings -- and creating improbably appealing pieces, like a 6-foot-tall ostrich with a body of brass and bronze and feathers of copper and steel. He also turned to natural materials, using chisels and electric saws to free the fluid forms he sensed were hidden in river stones and blocks of wood.</p>
        <p>His work has ''lots of humor and lots of character,'' said Benjamin Ortiz, the curator of art and collections at the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport. Not everyone appreciates it. Mr. DeMarco said some people ask bluntly, ''Do you give tetanus shots with that?''</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Shelton, Mr. DeMarco, 56, dropped out of school at age 16. He ran a masonry business for 20 years, he said, until he injured his back. He then tried salvage and trucking before building the career in real estate. ''A very negative situation brought me an extremely good gift,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One morning in May, Mr. DeMarco decided to make a tree. First he foraged for suitable steel scrap among the derelict vehicles and debris strewn about his wooded backyard. Then, to the hiss and crackle of an electric arc welder, the loud popping of an acetylene torch and the report of a hammer against steel, he gave the old, rusty metal new purpose.</p>
        <p>He worked without flagging until lunch, then set the tree aside, because too much welding bothered his eyes. That afternoon he decided to carve an abstract face from a block of maple, picked up an electric saw, and began.</p>
        <p>The Face of a Child</p>
        <p>Sometimes the tradeoffs that life demands are simply cruel. Bruce Morse of Sharon found his art when he lost his first-born son, Jesse, 9, who died following an automobile accident in 1988. ''I had the strongest desire to keep seeing his face,'' Mr. Morse said. He had never painted but wanted a portrait of Jesse and decided to try.</p>
        <p>One attempt led to another until he was painting obsessively, Mr. Morse said. ''Many days I was in deep depression, but if I could just focus on the painting and finish the painting, it would bring me relief,'' he said. He quit his job as a health aide to paint full time. His marriage ended -- shaken beyond repair, he said, by the death and the recriminations that followed. He had been driving his three sons to a soccer game, Mr. Morse said, when he failed to see an oncoming, speeding truck.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morse said Jesse's death awakened him to other pain, long buried: an alcoholic mother he could not save, a distant father, his parents' divorce and his own breakdown in his 20's, when he ''dropped out of life'' for several years and two psychiatrists diagnosed schizophrenia. All surfaced in his art. ''I couldn't have kept any of it in,'' he said. ''It all came out. It's not all pretty, but it's all me.''</p>
        <p>More recently, he has painted large, brightly colored canvases that ''border on the mystical,'' said Stewart Wilson, the director of Artwell, a non-profit arts association in Torrington. ''You look, you see abstract. You look again, you see imagery.'' Said Morse: ''You almost have to lose yourself in it, a kind of surrendering to it as a dream.''</p>
        <p>Born and raised in New York City, Mr. Morse, 56, was a poet in his youth and earned a degree in English literature. Six years ago he remarried; the couple has two small daughters. Add three teenagers -- his two sons and a stepson -- and money is tight. Wanting to attract dealers and galleries that handle outsider art, Mr. Morse took photos of his work and made a brochure -- only to be told, he said, that self-promotion was ''the kiss of death'' for an outsider. ''Evidently, the sort of thing they want is an artist who's completely in his own world and somebody else discovers him,'' he said. ''But nobody discovered me.''</p>
        <p>He became well-known to the people of Sharon, at least, after he chose purple paint for his garage, he said. Fanciful decorations dot his lawn, and over his front door a sign proclaims ''Gallery of Dreams.''</p>
        <p>''I didn't want people to pass here and say, 'That's where this poor man lives' and blah, blah, blah. Jesse left me a lot of joy, too,'' he said. ''Painting has given me a lot of joy and freed my soul in a lot of ways, so I count my blessings.''</p>
        <p>Stability in Ceiling Tiles</p>
        <p>Maurice Hansen said he felt death closing in. His old pal Vincent Van Gogh, a one-eared cat, died last year. Another friend, a fellow artist, had just died without warning, and at 58, Mr. Hansen said he feared his own mortality. He was distressed, too, about the stray cats in his New Haven neighborhood and what would become of them. And people were turning into robots with computers, he said, and he worried that America would be bombed late at night and he would be incinerated while painting pictures, and numerology scared him, as did movie theaters crowded with strangers who might be coughing, and commercials for ''The Blair Witch Project,'' and ''the original Elvis Presley'' -- he was ''scary-looking,'' too.</p>
        <p>In a different mood on another day, Mr. Hansen said it might be time to don his Tarzan underwear, run around in the backyard and shake up the neighbors. No doubt the police would be called, he said: ''I'd have to explain that I'm not crazy, I'm an artist.''</p>
        <p>Fearful, temperamental and traumatized by his past, yet playful, imaginative and prodigiously well-read, Mr. Hansen clearly lives a passionate and exhausting inner life. Schizophrenic and bipolar, according to a diagnosis he received in his 20's, he was repeatedly committed to a state mental hospital, where he endured electroshock and experimental insulin shock treatments and physical abuse, said Mr. Hansen and Chris Butler of Branford, his agent and friend. For more than a decade Mr. Hansen has refused further medication, and only painting keeps him balanced, Ms. Butler said. ''Everything from the outside world filters through his very different frame of reference,'' Ms. Butler said, ''and the end product is a pretty much continuous flow of art.''</p>
        <p>That art teems with classical and pop cultural references, from Shakespeare, the Bible and Poe in literature, to da Vinci, Van Gogh and Dali in art, to nursery rhymes, superheroes, and even, tucked into one extravagant painting, the kitchen sink. ''He wasn't getting anything he needed from his family, but he would get it from the culture, which inspired him,'' Ms. Butler said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hansen said his life ''started falling apart'' after his mother died, when he was 9. His father handed him off, first to his grandmother, who lived on the third floor of the family's home, then to an uncle in Hamden who had no patience for a creative boy who imposed order on an unfriendly world by making movies. His aunt was sympathetic and once enrolled him in an art school, but he didn't last long. ''Maurice is so much in his own world that he is not teachable,'' Ms. Butler said.</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. Hansen painted 78 scenes, from U.F.O.'s to Stonehenge to Pecos Bill, on the ceiling tiles of a store at Fellowship Place, a support center in New Haven for people with mental illness. Some of the tiles are three-dimensional; from one, Superman's powerful fist plunges straight down. The colors are dazzling, yet Mr. Hansen paints almost in the dark, Ms. Butler said.</p>
        <p>''It's good to have the shadow,'' Mr. Hansen agreed. But fears quickly resurfaced. ''Everywhere I go gets dark,'' he said. ''It gets lonelier and lonelier. And the darkness too is scary.''</p>
        <p>A Life's History Sketched in Leather</p>
        <p>In a prison about 30 years ago, Winfred Rembert Sr. learned how to score pretty designs into leather pocketbooks and billfolds. But as for tooling and dyeing large leather canvases into storytelling works of art -- no one taught him that.</p>
        <p>His wife, Patsy, raised the idea, Mr. Rembert said: ''She said: 'You should do some pictures. You got a history that people want to know about.' '' He wasn't so sure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert has always trusted his ability, explained Philip McBlain, a friend and rare-book dealer, ''but I don't think he's ever really had confidence that white folks or society at large would value what he could do.''</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Mr. Rembert put aside his doubts. Working into the night in the small front room of his New Haven home, he sketched a design on paper, redrew it on bigger paper, traced it onto wet leather donated by friends, cut every line up to five separate times with different tools, and mixed and applied the dyes. Each canvas took at least three weeks, he said.</p>
        <p>Steadily, he preserved his memories, from his Great Aunt Lillian, a field worker who raised him because his mother couldn't, to the town characters of Cuthbert, Ga., where he grew up, to the cotton fields where he saw a woman give birth. And he discovered that some people would value what he could do.</p>
        <p>Beginning Aug. 22, the Yale University Art Gallery will showcase his work. ''I think he's a real talent,'' said Jock Reynolds, the director of the gallery, who said he had seen Mr. Rembert's art on display at McBlain Books in Hamden, and admired it so much he went back for a second look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert, 54, said he had lost too much schooling to crop work and had dropped out in the 10th grade. In 1967, he stole a car, fought with a police officer, grabbed his gun and fled. Caught, he was almost lynched, he said. He spent seven years in prison. Afterward, he married Patsy and moved North.</p>
        <p>With jobs as a longshoreman and heavy equipment operator, Mr. Rembert supported a family that grew to eight children. But health problems sidelined him, and later he couldn't find work. In the 80's he briefly turned to drug dealing and served six months at a federal penitentiary, Mr. Rembert said. From sad knowledge he taught his children that drugs were dead ends.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Winfred Rembert Jr., then 16, refused to sell drugs for a local gang and  was shot protecting a younger brother from gang members. The incident made national news. ''He's the reason that his kids wouldn't participate,'' Mrs. Rembert said of her husband. ''I think he's a wonderful human being, to have gone through the things that he's gone through.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rembert said turmoil was a constant in his life. ''I've been running all of my life, just running and running,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I'm hoping someday my art will be successful enough for me to stop running.''</p>
        <p>Rolling With Bowling Balls</p>
        <p>At 5, Paul Livert performed a drum-and-tap-dance routine in theaters that were so fourth-rate, the vaudevillians stuck in them sneeringly called them ''toilets.''</p>
        <p>At a robust 79, Mr. Livert was back in the toilets again, and thrilled to be there.</p>
        <p>Some years ago a museum curator on Long Island termed Mr. Livert an outsider artist. The Brooklyn, N.Y.-born former record promoter, who said he had helped advance the careers of the Rolling Stones, Mantovani and Tom Jones, seized on the hook. When his younger son told him about the American Visionary Art Museum opening in Baltimore in 1995, he began to badger Ms. Hoffberger, the museum's founder and director, about his art, or ''scrapture.'' Late last year, 30-odd pieces of scrapture finally headed to Baltimore, where they were destined to beautify two rooms in the basement: the men's and the ladies'.</p>
        <p>''From toilet to toilet over a period of 75 years,'' Mr. Livert said with a chuckle. ''You couldn't make that up if you tried.'' Since the museum was ''top of the line for outsider art,'' he said, he had no objections to his unorthodox placement: ''As long as I was within the confines of that museum, I made it!'' (His pieces were later moved to the gift shop; more than a dozen have been sold, he said.) Why bowling balls? When his family moved to Oceanside, N.Y., more than 40 years ago, Mr. Livert explained, a cousin who was a pin boy at a bowling alley started donating old, scarred balls for use as lawn decor. When Mr. Livert's employment tapered off about 12 years ago, those balls caught his fancy. He painted and decorated them, first with plastic caps, later with brass, and ''it just grew,'' he said. Soon he was spending five to six hours a day on his art -- and not just bowling balls: teakettles, copper pots and other gleaming discards got faces, too. For the last few years, though, he devoted most of his time to caring for Cleo, his wife, who died of cancer last October.</p>
        <p>Asked what he was trying to say through his art, Mr. Livert snorted. If not for tenacity, he said, ''I would not have gotten this far. It's not because my work has a message or I have a vision. There's no message.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Livert's bright blue eyes do have vision. They can look at part of a dismantled chandelier and see hair blowing in the wind.</p>
        <p>Dripping Bursts of Color</p>
        <p>From a distance, the large red triangle on Robert Bonanno's living room wall resembled a wedge of pizza smothered in sauce. Up close, the marinara became thousands of little pillars of red crayon wax, glistening like stalagmites and formed in the same way, drop by drop. Mr. Bonanno titled the piece ''My Bleeding Heart.'' A subterranean cry of pain from the curly haired, genial Mr. Bonanno? ''Nah,'' he shrugged. ''It's just a name.''</p>
        <p>As a ''meltist'' (his word), technique dominates, said Mr. Bonanno, a carpenter by day who is married with two sons. He developed his technique through trial and error: dripping, which he used to create the heart and some small statues; layering, or adding puddles on top of puddles; streaking, which lets him fling drops of hot wax about; and circling and staining, which create overlapping bursts of color, like a kaleidoscope before the pattern settles.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Nutley, N.J., he started melting crayons as a lark at 15 and found that Crayolas worked best. Five of his pieces are on display at the Crayola factory in Easton, Pa., one of Mr. Bonanno's favorite places.</p>
        <p>His fragile artwork has cracked in extreme cold. In 1992, fire struck the basement of his Newark home, the heat reached the living room and most of his meltings melted. Mr. Bonanno said he felt compelled to re-create every lost piece -- ''just like an insect, building its little house again.'' His attachment is so strong that he's not eager to sell. ''They take so long to make, I try to hold on to them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Putting down his propane torch to pose for a snapshot, he held his latest piece at an angle to display its candy-colored layers. The picture taken, he impulsively touched his art to his cheek, then smiled fondly. ''It's still warm,'' he murmured.</p>
        <p>Miniatures and Boxes With Locks</p>
        <p>When he starts feeling introverted, Robert Parker said, his art gets smaller and smaller. Case in point: his diminutive chairs, which represent ''the companionship of solitude.''</p>
        <p>Is the reverse also true? If so, Mr. Parker must be poised to turn extrovert, because that tiny, dancing ear of corn is history. Now, he said, he wants to make giant vegetables. Commuters can become too complacent, he said. ''What if you drove by one day and there was a six-foot carrot where there hadn't been one the day before?'' he said. ''And you drive by the next day, the carrot's gone, but up the road's a tomato?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, 49, obviously enjoys the tweak. Some of his decorated boxes display prominent locks suggesting that something precious or startling is cached within. ''People say, 'Can I look inside?' '' he said. ''I say, 'Well, do you dare?' '' Those who do dare find -- nothing. ''That's sort of the chance you take,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, an unlocked box, ''Luck,'' is adorned with coins to entice peeks. Inside, as promised, is a lucky piece -- but a barrier of nails keeps eager hands away. ''You can't get luck,'' Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>An artist friend once used Mr. Parker's noble profile and silver-gray beard as the model for a portrait of Rip Van Winkle. The youngest of 10 children, he grew up in Harrisville, N.H. After high school came unsatisfying labor at textile mills before he landed his dream job: managing a tree farm.  Living in the woods without electricity or a telephone, he picked up a knife one day and started to carve.</p>
        <p>In 1979 Mr. Parker and his wife and baby daughter -- a son came later -- moved to Westchester County, where his wife's family owned an art supply store. He became vice president of the store, in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and stayed until 1999, then left for a less stressful job. Over the years, meanwhile, his work with wood evolved into art. He said he wanted people to see ordinary objects in a new light, so he built jointed wooden figures, three feet tall, and covered them with prosaic things like bottle caps. He designed wild masks out of shiny pieces of this 'n' that. He started showing work in galleries. He'd come a long way from whittling spoons.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get up one day when I was a kid and say, 'When I grow up, I'm going to be an artist,' '' Mr. Parker said. ''You come to it. You go through life, and you start to view the world from a different angle.''</p>
