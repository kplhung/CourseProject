        <p>With two million people crammed into the Times Square area last New Year's Eve and more than a billion watching the cascade of fireworks, laser beams and confetti on television, Renata McGriff should have been thrilled.</p>
        <p>Her Web site, TimesSquare2000.com, was the official site of the ''global celebration at the crossroads of the world.'' Ms. McGriff had said it would become the portal to entertainment and culture in Times Square, and to build it she had enlisted a Who's Who of the Internet world: Oracle, USWeb, Proxicom, Iomedia and others. She had attracted entrepreneurs and bankers to invest or lend about $6 million for a venture they all hoped would make a fortune.</p>
        <p>But while sanitation workers swept up 35 tons of debris on New Year's Day, the mess Ms. McGriff left behind is still haunting Times Square and the Internet industry. Although she has said the Web site had 20 million hits during the 26-hour New Year's celebration, her critics contend that it was far from the grand, technologically sophisticated site that Ms. McGriff had promised.</p>
        <p>Companies that worked on the project say they are owed millions of dollars. Investors are demanding to know where the money went. And more than 14 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts against Ms. McGriff and her company, TimesSquareMedia. The courts have handed down at least five default judgments against Ms. McGriff, totaling more than $1.3 million.</p>
        <p>Investors, analysts and executives said that the story of TimesSquare2000.com provided a glimpse into the Wild West character of the Internet, where untested entrepreneurs and get-rich-quick schemes abound.  Until April, when Internet stocks took a beating, investors had been more than willing to gamble on many ventures in the hope that just one might succeed.</p>
        <p>''It's a classic Web story,'' said Jeffrey A. Strauss, president of Countdown Entertainment. Countdown represents the owners of 1 Times Square, home of the New Year ball drop, in marketing the annual event, and  licensed TimesSquare2000.com as the event's official Web site.</p>
        <p>''She spun a wonderful story, got a lot of people excited, but in the end couldn't deliver on her promises,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff, who declined to be interviewed for this article, said in a statement that she was trying to arrange a merger with another Web site or sell her company, attributing her problems to investors who had failed to provide promised financing.</p>
        <p>But Peter Korian, the president of Iomedia, stated in an affidavit filed in State Supreme Court that Ms. McGriff had ''stiffed'' his company and others, using ''systematic deceit'' to get goods and services without paying.</p>
        <p>Today, even with the venture under legal siege, Internet executives and people who poured their life savings into Ms. McGriff's company still say she had a brilliant concept.</p>
        <p>''Renata's a great salesperson, a very talented woman,'' said Peter Dugan, vice chairman of the DVCi Group, a marketing and information technology company that won a $500,000 judgment against her for unpaid bills. ''And it was a great concept. If done properly, it would have been huge.''</p>
        <p>The executives said they had been willing at first to overlook Ms. McGriff's inexperience and increasingly grandiose plans. But according to interviews with dozens of executives involved in the project and claims made in numerous lawsuits, Ms. McGriff began bouncing checks to one company after another for software, hardware and consulting services, and then refusing to return phone calls.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff said in her statement that venture capitalists she did not identify had not provided the money they had agreed to invest, then had ''incited'' her relationship with various vendors, using them as ''pawns'' in an effort to take control of her company. According to former executives at TimesSquareMedia, Ms. McGriff battled with Sunrise Securities, an investment bank that worked with her to raise financing, and Warburg Pincus Asset Management, which invested about $2.9 million. Executives at the two companies declined to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>At first glance, Renata Watson McGriff, 43, seems an unlikely candidate to start an Internet company.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff, described even by her critics as bright, articulate and persuasive, worked as a secretary or executive assistant for several companies during the 1980's before becoming vice president of sales in 1988 for Spectacolor Communications, a sign company in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Contrary to what she told her employers or stated in business plans circulated to investors, school records show that Ms. McGriff did not graduate from either City College of New York or Arizona State University.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. McGriff has said in press material that she produced Mickey Mouse's 60th-birthday party in Times Square for Disney in 1988, her client was actually Eastman Kodak. The film company wanted to put Mickey's image on a huge Specta color sign in Times Square, and Ms. McGriff played a key role in organizing a promotional event there featuring Mickey Mouse.</p>
        <p>In 1994, Ms. McGriff was again a secretary, in the communications department at Sony. After six months, she moved to Disney, where she worked for a senior lawyer.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff began her first Internet venture in 1998, when she proposed creating a Web site to sell gift certificates from expensive retailers to corporate executives.</p>
        <p>''It was a time when everyone was trying to latch onto the next big wave,'' said Stephen Galluccio, who wrote the business plan for her company and is suing her for $70,000. ''It was a really good idea.''</p>
        <p>She called it Citigroup, and challenged Travelers and Citicorp when those merging companies adopted the same name. She settled with the company for $300,000, according to a  former business adviser. At the same time, Ms. McGriff sought money for the project from Flatiron Partners in New York and investors from California with the help of an old boss, Larry Bridge, a former vice president for investor relations at CBS.</p>
        <p>Flatiron was willing to invest $1 million, but only if someone with more business experience than her would be chief executive of what was then called Gift Certificate Network.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff rejected the deal, and as the project collapsed, she and her daughter took a trip to Greece. Since then, she has been sued for a total of $110,000 by the travel agency, Mr. Galluccio and a printer. The agency won a default judgment in State Supreme Court, and the other two cases are pending.</p>
        <p>A few months later, in December 1998, Ms. McGriff talked to Mr. Strauss of Countdown Entertainment about TimesSquare2000.com. She described a site that would broadcast the New Year's Eve celebration from New York and other cities worldwide, and have virtual concerts, electronic postcards, chat rooms, ticket sales and merchandise.</p>
        <p>''She came to us with a wonderful idea,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''She set up meetings with major players at Excite, AOL, USWeb and Oracle. At the time it was the dot-com craze.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Strauss signed a four-year licensing agreement with Countdown in March 1999 in return for 10 percent of profits from advertising and merchandise sales. Ms. McGriff's company, in turn, would provide information about Times Square festivities and programming for the five huge video screens in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff started the venture with her own money, but soon she was signing contracts with Internet companies and raising more than $1 million from investors, including $750,000 from a group in Texas.</p>
        <p>Three months later, on June 15, Ms. McGriff convened a remarkable meeting at a hotel in Times Square. More than 50 top executives from USWeb, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, EarthCam and DVCi, as well as her corporate lawyers and investors, crowded into the room to discuss how the Web site was taking shape. For each executive, the presence of so much talent in one room seemed to confirm the wisdom of their decision to get involved.</p>
        <p>''I was amazed by the meeting,'' said Tom Hyland, who heads the new media group at the PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm and worked briefly with Ms. McGriff. ''She's a very articulate, convincing marketing woman who appeared to be well connected. There's a momentum when you get certain names together.''</p>
        <p>A person who was there said that  ''in a matter of minutes'' some investors pushed their revenue projections from $10 million a year to $200 million.</p>
        <p>But there were tremors below the surface. Ms. McGriff's publicists, Middleberg &amp; Associates, quit. They were replaced by Urge Public Relations, and then, after a dispute over payment, by Ruder Finn, which has filed suit for more than $123,000 in unpaid bills.</p>
        <p>By Thanksgiving, USWeb, which is now known as MarchFirst, and Oracle had also quit the project over unpaid bills. Jennifer Glass, a spokeswoman for Oracle, said her company was owed more than $1 million and was considering legal action. DVCi followed USWeb and was later replaced by Proxicom, which won a $540,000 default judgment in Federal District Court this year against Ms. McGriff and her company.</p>
        <p>A rudimentary version of Times Square2000.com went up in September, and Ms. McGriff announced her greatest coup: her site would be the global sponsor for America Online's ''Party of the Millennium.'' But the alliance broke up over concerns that the site would not be able to handle the enormous Web traffic it was expected to generate.</p>
        <p>Just before Thanksgiving, Warburg Pincus invested $2.2 million and promised more. A month later, a Japanese businessman, Yuji Suzuki,  gave Ms. McGriff the first of two installments on a $1 million loan, in return for stock options. But more work had to be done on the Web site in the frantic weeks leading up to New Year, and while Ms. McGriff sought new investors to provide $20 million, that big infusion never came.</p>
        <p>A few days before the celebration, Ms. McGriff called a news conference at a restaurant in Times Square. But she did not show up, and among the 50 people who did were creditors demanding to be paid.</p>
        <p>''She sent me there, but didn't tell me there'd be these irate people,'' one executive said. ''People were literally lined up in front of the press.''</p>
        <p>New Year's Eve in Times Square was a huge success. Ms. McGriff's Web site displayed information about Times Square and New Year's Eve events and views of the ball drop, but was unable to offer hotel and restaurant reservations and other features she had once described.</p>
        <p>''She cast the only dark cloud over an otherwise spectacular event,'' said Brian Cury, chief executive of EarthCam, an Internet company with cameras throughout Times Square. ''We wanted to participate in a substantial event that would enhance the Times Square celebration. She threw out some insane amount of money that made people think, 'Even if I get a third of it, it'd be great.' We had a $2.7 million deal, and she stuck me.''</p>
        <p>In February, Ms. McGriff turned to the Barr Financial Group in Tampa, Fla., to revive the venture. At that time, the company's founder, Alfred Barr, said that only $5,000 remained of the $6 million invested.</p>
        <p>As he waded through piles of bills, promissory notes and stock options, Mr. Barr said Ms. McGriff had told him that a lawyer for Mr. Suzuki had shown up at her penthouse in Manhattan, saying that she had pledged company stock and personal assets as security for his $1 million loan, which had come due in February. Warburg Pincus made similar claims, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barr said he had already raised $40 million from two groups of investors, but Ms. McGriff refused to agree to their terms.</p>
        <p>In April, Ms. McGriff announced that she was reviving TimesSquare 2000.com as GothamLive.com, an entree to New York restaurants, entertainment and culture. A company called On2.com was to be the host of the site, but the partnership did not last. ''We're in a dispute with her over her payment under the contract for our services,'' said Douglas McIntyre, chief executive of On2.com.</p>
        <p>But Ms. McGriff is still at it. The Web site TimesSquare2000.com is still up. Ms. McGriff said she was trying to sell TimesSquareMedia or merge with a larger company.</p>
        <p>''She's actively trying to do it as a way to realize the full value of the company,'' said her company's current lawyer, Christopher Boies, ''and to satisfy her potential investors.''</p>
        <p>Ms. McGriff met recently with executives of Cablevision Systems and Primedia, a publisher of magazines, but an executive at Cablevision said that nothing would come of it.</p>
