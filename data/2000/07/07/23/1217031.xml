        <p>Those whose definition of ''family entertainment'' involves the Hokey Pokey or some guy in a Barney the Dinosaur suit need not inquire about the Family Times Series at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. But those who are interested in exposing children to musicians, dancers and traditions from all over the world would do well to check out the family series for 2000-2001, which has just been announced.</p>
        <p>It starts Oct. 1 with Ragamala, classical East Indian music, dance and poetry intermingled with Western influences. Other stops around the globe include ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters,'' an African adaptation of ''Cinderella'' presented Dec. 2 by the St. Louis Black Repertory Company, and a Chinese New Year celebration on Feb. 3 and 4 with the Nai-Ni Chen Dance Company.</p>
        <p>Bobby Sanabria and his nine-member Ascension ensemble bring an assortment of Latin music on Oct. 7, and the I Wan Jan Taiwanese puppet theater is due on March 24. Good old American jazz and folk are also represented, by, among others, Kenny Garrett on Jan. 27 and Tom Chapin on March 31. Seasonal offerings celebrate Christmas and Kwanzaa.</p>
