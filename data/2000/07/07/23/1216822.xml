        <p>A &amp; R</p>
        <p>By Bill Flanagan.</p>
        <p>Random House, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Bill Flanagan, a rock journalist and editorial director of the music television network VH1, has written a caustic and funny first novel about a world he knows intimately. ''A &amp; R'' is about a gifted, idealistic ''artists and repertory'' man -- that is, a talent scout -- named Jim Cantone, who joins powerhouse WorldWide Music; the innocent life he knew at his old, small label vanishes like cocaine up a rock star's nose. The C.E.O. is partying in the Caribbean, the president is plotting a coup d'etat, and the chief financial officer -- obese, gay, black, Buddhist -- is playing all the angles. Cantone's hot new band will sign on only if Black Beauty, a feminist ''cultural collective,'' is also offered a contract. As his exuberant plot twists and turns, Flanagan stumbles by injecting his sense of cosmic justice, as if righting in literature the wrongs he has witnessed in life. The bad guy almost loses his kidneys to black-market organ thieves; the good guys land on their feet with plum jobs. But Flanagan wrings emotion from little details, like the heartbreak of a backup musician whose washed-up boss steals his great new song. Finding the absurd humor in a world where careers rise and fall on the whims of radio programmers and the Christmas lists of adolescents, Flanagan has written an unusually lively novel.</p>
