        <p>Two trustees of the Long Island Power Authority, contradicting their chairman, Richard M. Kessel, said last week that they were not told that a $20 million energy conservation grant to Nassau County would actually be used by the county to reduce its budget deficit.</p>
        <p>How the money was used has raised issues about whether the county and LIPA, a state agency financed by electricity customers, acted properly in allowing the diversion of the money from its publicly stated purpose.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel has defended the grant as necessary to gain Nassau's agreement to let the power authority settle a $1.4 billion tax judgment against Suffolk County for $620 million. That judgment was based on an overassessment of the Shoreham nuclear power plant in calculating the taxes that LIPA paid.</p>
        <p>While apologizing for not making the probable use of the $20 million clearer when the settlement was announced, Mr. Kessel has insisted he was candid with board members and ''never hid the facts'' from the news media or the public.</p>
        <p>But statements by the two trustees raised questions about what board members knew and how they expected the money would be spent.</p>
        <p>And the Nassau comptroller, Frederick Parola, has accused Mr. Kessel and the county of misappropriating the $20 million. Under the terms of the grant, he said, the money had to be spent for energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parola has referred the matter to the Nassau County District Attorney's office, where a spokesman, Edward Grilli, said it was under review.</p>
        <p>In Albany, Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, chairman of the Assembly's standing committee on energy, said he was considering hearings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said last week that before a vote on the settlement in February, he had candidly advised the 15 trustees that the grant to Nassau, which was being funneled through a LIPA clean-energy fund for energy conservation, would instead go toward reducing Nassau's budget deficit.</p>
        <p>''I told them,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''They knew.''</p>
        <p>But one trustee, Harvey Auerbach, owner of the Brookwood Management Company, which owns and manages apartment houses, said he and other board members had not been informed.</p>
        <p>''Nobody told the trustees it would be used for any other purpose,'' he said. ''It was my understanding, and I believe the understanding of the rest of the board, that the money was to be used for clean energy.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he felt the board had been misled, Mr. Auerbach replied, ''Possibly.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the overall settlement of the tax claim that the grant was attached to, he added: ''I think in order to make the deal happen, the LIPA officials felt they were comfortable in doing this. I will stand with the chairman on this thing,'' a reference to Mr. Kessel. ''In the overall scheme of things, I don't think this is earth-shattering.''</p>
        <p>He said he expected that in the long run, Nassau would spend $20 million for clean energy programs, justifying the grant.</p>
        <p>A second trustee, Michael L. Faltischek, the managing partner of Ruskin, Moscou, Evans &amp; Faltischek, a Mineola law firm, said that Nassau officials had demanded the $20 million but that the trustees had agreed only after insisting that it be given explicitly for energy conservation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Faltischek said he was surprised when he learned the county had spent the money instead to help close its deficit. But he said that the grant had ''no time limits'' and that Nassau could eventually spend the money for its intended use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said last week that he had no plans to ''interfere with Nassau County'' over how the money was used.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Falti schek said they regarded the grant as ''a small piece of a big puzzle,'' as Mr. Faltischek put it.</p>
        <p>Another trustee, Michael Affrunti, the president of Albertson Electric, said the money was ''earmarked for conservation'' but beyond the authority's control once it was transferred to Nassau. He said there was ''no clear-cut prohibition'' on how the county used the money.</p>
        <p>Asked if Mr. Kessel had said the money would really be used for deficit reduction, he answered, ''The question never came up.''</p>
        <p>He also said board members ''all breathed a sigh of relief'' when Nassau finally agreed to the overall settlement, adding, ''We felt that we had saved Long Island from a disaster.''</p>
        <p>Records show that only one trustee, Harriet A. Gilliam, a lawyer from Riverhead, referred to the grant before the board's vote, on Feb. 3. Minutes of the meeting said she ''looks forward to hearing from Nassau County in the future as to how they allocated these funds and the projects and programs that were implemented pursuant to this grant.''</p>
        <p>Also at issue is an additional $5 million payment from LIPA to Nassau that was apparently authorized by Mr. Kessel without a vote by the trustees, bringing the total grant to $25 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kessel said the payments could only be understood in the context of the larger settlement, which spared Suffolk County from having to pay the full $1.4 billion settlement, as opposed to a $620 million reimbursement of excess taxes to LIPA. That money was already being collected through higher electric rates paid by Suffolk customers.</p>
        <p>''We didn't just give Nassau $25 million out of thin air to balance their budget,'' Mr. Kessel said. ''We gave Nassau County $25 million in the context of forgiving Suffolk County for over $700 million. It is unfair to look at the Nassau County end without looking at the context of the entire settlement.''</p>
        <p>''Some of the people who are loudest now in their criticisms are people who knew all along and were totally comfortable with it,'' Mr. Kessel said, evidently a reference to Mr. Parola, the comptroller.</p>
        <p>At a news conference earlier this month, Mr. Parola and Gordian Raacke, the executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a watchdog agency, said Mr. Kessel and ''certain Nassau County officials'' had not only misappropriated the $20 million, but had ''failed to fully disclose the nature of a financial transaction between LIPA and the county.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parola said he had only recently been made aware that the $20 million grant was specifically for energy conservation. That assertion contradicted both Mr. Kessel and the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who has also said Mr. Parola knew of the intended use of the money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke said he was asking for an independent investigation for what he called blatant misappropriation of $25 million in ratepayers' money by a public agency.</p>
        <p>''The public has a right of full disclosure and we want to know exactly what happened and who the involved individuals were,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raacke, who has attended every meeting of the authority's board, said he never heard Mr. Kessel or any trustee say the $20 million was for anything other than energy conservation. He said he only learned the money had gone to Nassau's budget deficit after it was reported in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Faltischek said they did not believe the controversy over the use of the funds would damage public confidence in LIPA. ''You have to look at what was achieved,'' Mr. Auerbach said. ''If this settlement was not implemented, Suffolk County would be bankrupted.''</p>
        <p>Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the Suffolk County Legislature, said the grant was ''not about the merit of the LIPA agreement.''</p>
        <p>''This is about truth, honesty and the fiduciary responsibilities of the LIPA board in accounting for $25 million in ratepayer money, and the misappropriation of that money by Nassau County officials.''</p>
