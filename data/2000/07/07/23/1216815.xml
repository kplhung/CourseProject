        <p>Bone by Bone, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage International, $14.) The last of three novels about the life and times of Edgar J. Watson -- cane planter, entrepreneur and mass murderer -- recounts his conquest of Florida's Gulf Coast, an obsession with echoes in the imperialistic impulses of a growing America. ''This is a work of genuine dignity,'' Sven Birkerts wrote in the Book Review in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Clone Age: Adventures in the New World of Reproductive Technology, by Lori B. Andrews (Owl/Holt, $15.) A lawyer traces her career as an expert in the legal and moral aspects of assisted reproduction from the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 to the threshold of the clone age. ''Hers is a fine and readable book,'' John R. G. Turner wrote here last year. ''She has a wonderful dry sense of humor.''</p>

        <p>Bone by Bone, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage International, $14.) The last of three novels about the life and times of Edgar J.

        <p>The Clone Age: Adventures in the New World of Reproductive Technology, by Lori B. Andrews (Owl/Holt, $15.) A lawyer traces her career as an expert in the legal and moral aspects of assisted reproduction from the birth of the first test-tube baby in 1978 to the threshold of the clone age. ''Hers is a fine and readable book,'' John R. G. Turner wrote here last year. ''She has a wonderful dry sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>Turn of the Century, by Kurt Andersen. (Delta, $14.95.) This sprawling comedy of millennial manners revolves around a nomadic power couple -- a hypersuccessful Silicon Alley C.E.O. and a struggling television producer -- at play in the infotainment economy of Manhattan. Andersen ''wins back terrain for the novel that has been ceded to new media, demonstrating that the novel is as alive and as nimble as its high-tech competitors,'' Po Bronson said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century, by Witold Rybczynski. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $15.) The suburban visionary who designed Central Park and other monuments of green is portrayed as a humble man with little formal training who believed in the restorative power of landscape for ordinary citizens. Last year our reviewer, Suzannah Lessard, called this an ''excellent biography'' that is ''thorough and respectful, yet easeful in a way that is reminiscent of Olmsted himself.''</p>
        <p>Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys, by Will Self. (Grove, $12.) The killing of a fly imagined as blood sport. A Londoner who finds a giant rock of crack cocaine under his house. These outlandish stories both amuse and horrify as they render everyday reality plastic and absurd. Last year our reviewer, Jonathan Lethem, admired Self's ''vibrantly caustic prose and his anarchic and florid satirical premises.''</p>
        <p>Byron: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame, by Benita Eisler. (Vintage, $18.) According to this biography, the poet was both an arrogant English patrician and a prodigious libertine whose devotion to sexual freedom got him into a world of trouble. ''The seesawing moods and volatile allegiances of Byron . . . are reported with sensitive understanding,'' Claude Rawson said here in 1999. The book ''astutely identifies links between Byron's defiance of prevailing moral codes and his political radicalism.''</p>
        <p>The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West, by Michael Wallis. (St. Martin's Griffin, $21.95.) The 101 Ranch, a vast private spread founded after the Civil War that once covered nearly 110,000 acres in northeastern Oklahoma, helped to shape popular perceptions of the American frontier for many years. Wallis ''is the first writer to tie together the 101 Ranch's many stories,'' Allen Barra wrote in these pages in 1999. The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America, by James Wilson (Grove, $16) is not so much a survey of Indian cultures as it is a study of the calamitous impact of white conquest on indigenous societies and a dissection of the many myths generated by the conquerors. Last year our reviewer, Richard E. Nicholls, called this a ''carefully researched and wide-ranging narrative.''</p>
        <p>Memento Mori, by Muriel Spark. (New Directions, $11.95.) In this mystery set in 1950's London, a group of elderly friends (with more than a few skeletons in their closets) is tormented by an anonymous telephone caller who informs each of them, ''Remember you must die.'' ''Spark's trim, unloitering narrative reveals a fairly complete gamut of human seaminess,'' Robert Phelps wrote in the Book Review in 1959. The result is ''a daffily hilarious book, even though it is pervasively concerned with the importance of Death and Judgment.''</p>
        <p>Run Catch Kiss, by Amy Sohn. (Scribner, $12.) Ariel Steiner, the precocious young heroine of this first novel, is a sex columnist for a Manhattan newspaper who kicks up a citywide scandal when it's discovered she's been making up colorful material for her column. ''It's hard not to be entertained by the hapless but indomitable Ariel'' and her misadventures, Matthew Flamm wrote here in 1999.</p>
