        <p>In recent years, staff members of Community Board 1 have taken to driving around Astoria in spring to view the growing number of sidewalk cafes. But these are not sightseeing tours, said George Delis, the board's district manager. They are inspections of whether the restaurants are abiding by their sidewalk cafe permits, he said, if they have permits at all.</p>
        <p>''We counted 28 sidewalk cafes this year,'' he said. ''Only half of them were licensed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delis said the board sends the  names of what it believes are the offending cafes to the police and the city's Department of Consumer Affairs, both of which can issue summonses for violations. Some restaurants are subsequently cited.</p>
        <p>But residents say unlicensed tables are only one problem. The assistant district manager of the board, Lucille Hartmann, said they often complain that the cafes create  ''loitering, noise, brawls, and double-parking.''</p>
        <p>Betty DeSimone, who lives on 33rd Street, said: ''I hear them through my window. I have to use my air-conditioner to block out the noise.''</p>
        <p>But restaurant owners say that they need the outdoor cafes to compete and that they are an essential part of New York.</p>
        <p>Nick Constantinou, an owner of the Athens Cafe on 30th Avenue, said: ''If you want a city that goes to sleep at 9 p.m., then you don't want sidewalk cafes. Let's not forget, Astoria is part of New York City.''</p>
        <p>Two patrons of the restaurant's cafe, Gus Kombas, a painter, and Pete Deligiannis, a Board of Education inspector, agreed. ''We come here to talk about politics and girls,'' Mr. Kombas said over a mocha-colored drink wigged with lacy foam. ''It's part of why we live here.''</p>
        <p>As for licensing, Mr. Constantinou complained about bureaucracy. He  said he applied more than a year ago to place 16 tables in front of an  addition to his restaurant, and still has not received a final decision.</p>
        <p>''The process is not efficient,'' he  said. ''You call and they send you from agency to agency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Constantinou admitted that rather than wait for the City Council to approve his new permit, he simply takes some tables from among the 16 he is currently allowed and puts them in front of the addition. He said he has not gotten a summons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delis agreed the application process, which involves filing plans with several agencies, should be streamlined. ''It should be simpler for the little guy who wants three tables outside his pizzeria for smokers,'' he said, ''than for the guy who wants 50 tables.''</p>
