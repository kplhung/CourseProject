        <p>Democrats unveiled details today for their convention intended to gently disengage Vice President Al Gore from President Clinton and establish him as an independent leader while still celebrating the Clinton policies that have helped create the longest economic boom in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>Over four days, from Aug. 14 to 17, the convention would build gradually from heralding Mr. Clinton's record and policies to the highlights of Mr. Gore's biography to a climax on Thursday, when Mr. Gore would be nominated.</p>
        <p>Drawing lessons from the 1988 Republican convention, the Democrats will have Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore make a joint appearance somewhere outside the convention location in Los Angeles to show a changing of the party's guard.</p>
        <p>In 1988, President Reagan symbolically passed the torch of leadership to Vice President George Bush in a brief ceremony at an Air Force Base near the convention in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>But unlike the 1988 event, the Democrats said Mr. Clinton's appearance would be substantive and extensive. Though aides want to use the convention to move Mr. Gore out of the president's shadow, Mr. Clinton remains very popular with many Democrats, and the Gore campaign does not want to appear to be shunting him to the side.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton would also address the convention in prime time on the opening day, Monday, Aug. 14.</p>
        <p>The convention's overall themes, ''Progress and Prosperity'' and ''People, not the Powerful,'' have been drawn from the oratory of Mr. Gore's recent campaign appearances, where he has attacked big oil and drug companies and his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, saying Mr. Bush is beholden to special interests.</p>
        <p>The convention would open with a focus on the nation's prosperity. Besides Mr. Clinton, the speakers would include Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate in New York.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, under the theme ''You ain't seen nothing yet,'' a favorite stump line of Mr. Gore's, some of the party's most prominent leaders would talk about the important choices facing the nation.</p>
        <p>Prime time speakers would include the Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Senator Bill Bradley. Seeking to evoke images of President John F. Kennedy, who was nominated in Los Angeles in 1960, the Democrats would also have Carolyn Kennedy Schlossberg and Senator Edward M. Kennedy speak on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, with the theme ''The Principled Fighter,'' the convention would begin focusing more heavily on Mr. Gore, using testimonials and videos to highlight his biography, from his time as an Army reporter in Vietnam to his work as an investigative newspaper reporter in Nashville to his years as a congressman and senator from Tennessee.  ''The vice president is famous but still not well known,'' said an adviser to Mr. Gore. ''We believe that the more people learn about him, the more they like him. And I think a lot of the things we present to people that night will be new.''</p>
        <p>His running mate would also be nominated that night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would spend the first three days of the convention campaigning around the country. Because the television networks are not planning to devote much prime time coverage to the convention, the Gore campaign planned to use the vice president's off-convention events to try to pick up additional television coverage.</p>
        <p>The vice president would arrive at the convention on Wednesday night and receive the nomination on Thursday evening. He would be introduced by his wife, Tipper.</p>
        <p>There may also be some cameo appearances by Hollywood stars. Barbra Streisand, for one, is scheduled to sing at an event near the convention center.</p>
