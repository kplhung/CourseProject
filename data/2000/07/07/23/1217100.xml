        <p>How hip is too hip? It depends on which Williamsburger you ask.</p>
        <p>A local group, citing too many loud bars in the area, is suing the State Liquor Authority after the agency gave a license to Sin-e, a club offering live music that is to open next month at 142-44 North Eighth Street. But Sin-e's owner, who owns a music club on the Lower East Side, says  Williamsburg residents invited him.</p>
        <p>The group, Friends of the Northside, which has fought the liquor license since last fall, says it was taken by surprise by the April 26 decision, which followed a hearing it says it was not told about in time.</p>
        <p>''The community really didn't get the opportunity to voice its opposition,'' said Barry Mallin, a lawyer.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the liquor authority declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Construction of the club resumed when the license was granted.</p>
        <p>Residents handing out ''Make Sin-e Go Away'' fliers recently said they had suffered from the area's recent popularity and what one called ''theme park'' development.</p>
        <p>''We've had loud, obnoxious, drunken behavior,'' said Sarah Porter, who lives across the street from the site for Sin-e. ''People have had their doors rung in the middle of the night, there's been urinating, car mirrors smashed, new trees being destroyed.''</p>
        <p>She added that the block in question, between Bedford Avenue and Berry Street, is mostly residential, and that there are eight bars within one block in every direction.</p>
        <p>Shane Doyle, Sin-e's owner, said he would not cater to rowdy patrons.</p>
        <p>''Most people that pay money to see a gig, they don't get drunk or disorderly,'' he said, adding that the 4,800-square-foot one-story site is zoned for industrial use.</p>
        <p>Mr. Doyle, who owns Arlene Grocery in Manhattan, said many of his performers and patrons were Williamsburg residents who encouraged him to open a club in Brooklyn, and that local residents had signed petitions for him. He said he had offered to make the space available for community groups at no charge.</p>
        <p>Wendy Small, a North Eighth Street resident who supports Sin-e, said the influx of artists had made the area more valuable. ''Given that they do that, they should also have a place to make their music,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But residents said they would have preferred that the space be used for a doctor's office or a day care center.</p>
        <p>''These people who come in from Manhattan, they don't care about the neighborhood,'' said Stephen Wiepz, 63, who has lived on North Eighth Street all his life. ''They come, they party and they leave.''</p>
