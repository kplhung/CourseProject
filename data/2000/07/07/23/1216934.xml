        <p>SENATOR Joseph I. Lieberman recently came back to his old Stamford neighborhood to officially announce his intention to run for a third term representing Connecticut in the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>But in kicking off his bid for re-election in the backyard at his 85-year-old mother's house, Mr. Lieberman could not quell growing speculation he is on a short list of high-profile Democrats who will be seriously considered as a running mate for Vice President Al Gore at the party's Convention Aug. 13-17 in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>A centrist Democrat who stunned former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. when he beat him by 10,000 votes in 1988, Mr. Lieberman has gained a national reputation as one of the  stronger moral voices in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who is an Orthodox Jew, was the first Democrat to publicly criticize President Clinton for his ''morally reprehensible'' behavior in the affair with Monica S. Lewinsky -- though he voted against removing the president from office.</p>
        <p>In the United States Senate, Mr. Lieberman, 58, became the ranking Democratic member of the Governmental Affairs Committee in January 1999. Since 1995, he has been chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman served as majority leader of the Connecticut Senate for six years during the 1970's and as the state's 21st Attorney General from 1982-88.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Lieberman raised concerns in a highly publicized letter to United States Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt over an issue of growing concern to Connecticut residents -- the petition process for Native American tribes seeking federal recognition. Mr. Lieberman, who attended Yale, also has a strong interest in the environment, having helped to establish a Long Island Sound office in the Environmental Protection Agency, promoting a national wildlife refuge along the Connecticut River, and helping to strengthen federal Clean Air standards.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Lieberman took some time out during one of his regular ''diner stops'' in New Haven -- the city where he lives with his wife, Hadassah -- to have a bagel and a cup of coffee and talk about his 30-year political career and future. Following are excerpts of that conversation.</p>
        <p>Q. Considering your recent announcement of seeking a third term in the United States Senate, what are you most proud of accomplishing during your first two terms?  A. Perhaps the most remarkable transition that has occurred during the past 12 years is to watch the economy of this state and country. We have gone from real deep recession to the boom period we're in now where most people are living better lives than before. I am also proud of strides we have made in environmental protection areas, keeping our defenses strong, and having been an advocate for the Connecticut defense industry and jobs.  Q. There are still many people who haven't benefited from the economic boom. What can be done to help them?  A. One of the key goals of the next period of our history will be not only be to continue the strong economy and sustain economic growth, but to make sure that some of the people who have been left out of the rising tide of our economy are included. You do that with better public education and a much more aggressive program of job training and re-training, for people who are unemployed -- to match them up with the jobs that do exist.  Q. You have been heavily involved in environmental issues. What are the most important environmental issues facing Connecticut?  A. The two most pressing environmental priorities for Connecticut are cleaner air and water. Smog remains a serious problem for us in Connecticut. We still haven't met our goal of going a full year with satisfactory air quality measured by levels of the six worst pollutants in the air. Reports say 41 percent of Hartford school children have asthma -- the highest rate in the country.</p>
        <p>It's equally important that we address a major threat to our water supply -- the gasoline additive MTBE, which is potentially toxic and has leaked into our ground water supply and has contaminated the water we drink and bathe in.  Q. There has been a lot of speculation about the vice presidency, that you are on a short list of potential running mates for Vice President Al Gore. What have you heard about your chances?  A. Obviously I'm honored to have my name mentioned for the vice presidency and I would have to seriously consider such an offer. It makes my mother proud just to be mentioned as a possibility. But I don't expect it to happen. Right now the only office I intend to seek this year is re-election to the U.S. Senate.  Q. You are an Orthodox Jew. Is the country ready for a Jewish vice president, or even president?  A. I think this is a remarkably tolerant country at this time. I honestly don't think any candidate for national office will lose because of his or her religion, race, gender, or nationality. I think the public is so fair and sophisticated they are going to judge candidates for national office based on his or her qualities and capacity to do the job.  Q. If elected vice president, would your duties in any way be curtailed by being an Orthodox Jew, for example not being able to work on Saturdays or high holy days?  A. I have always tried to separate pure politics on the Sabbath, which I  don't do, from governmental responsibility. It seems to me my religion, as I understand it, not only permits me to fulfill important work associated with being a public servant, but actually requires me to do so because people are depending on me. I don't see that as an issue at all.  Q. What led you to so strongly criticizing President Bill Clinton for his involvement with Monica Lewinsky?  A. It was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made in my public life because President Clinton is a friend and I have tremendous admiration for him for the job he's done as president. But I was so upset by what he had done and the fact he hadn't leveled with the American people. I felt it wasn't going to get better until somebody who was his friend and supporter came publicly with honest and open criticism.  Q. You knew Bill Clinton in the early 1970's when you first ran for elected office in the State Senate and he was a student at Yale. Any recollections about the president at that time?  A. In 1970, when I first campaigned for office, I was the reform candidate running against the incumbent Democrat, and most of the political organizations -- most of the grown-ups -- were supporting the incumbent. I had a bunch of kids working for me.</p>
        <p>In the middle of that campaign, Bill Clinton, then a Yale law student, walked into my headquarters and offered to help. I do remember him and we always kept in touch after that.</p>
        <p>Later, I think I actually may have been the first Democrat to come out and support him.  Q. Why did you support Bill Clinton so early in his presidential campaign?  A. Most importantly we agreed on ideas, that the Democratic party had to move back to the center and had to express new ideas instead of following policies that were two, three and four decades old and no longer working either for our party or for the country.  Q. In your latest book published this year, ''In Praise of Public Life,'' you strongly defend public service and write about how important it is to serve. Does it dismay you there are so many Connecticut legislative races this year that are uncontested? Is it apathy or are people afraid to challenge incumbents?  A. It concerns me a great deal. I am very surprised at how few state legislative races in Connecticut are uncontested this year. I think that is partly an expression of the broader problem of people generally being less interested in politics or political involvement. But I think a lot of these legislative districts have become pretty strongly included toward one party or the other, so people in the out party don't want to run.</p>
