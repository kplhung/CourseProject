        <p>PAIGE-Peter. Died at Meadowedge, his home in Bellport, NY, on July 21. Peter is survived by his bride of 56 years, Natalie Lambing Paige; three sons, Peter Otis Paige of Yardley, PA, Douglas Warner Paige of Robbinsville, NJ, and Lee Allen Paige of North Andover, MA; two sisters, Mary Paige McGuirk of Bel Air, MD, and Sheila Paige Dominy of Shelter Island, NY; seven grandchildren; and countless friends and loved ones. Born in Bellport in 1917 to Douglas Warner and Julia Edey Paige, Peter attended the Choate School and Princeton University. He joined American Airlines but was soon called to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps' Air Transport Command during WWII. After the war, he became one of the first employees of Brookhaven National Laboratory. He retired from the Lab in 1981 as Personnel Director. A life-long sailor, Peter was known and respected the length and breadth of Great South Bay. In particular, he achieved great racing success in the Star class, winning several regional and national trophies. The Bellport Bay Yacht Club, where he served four years as Commodore, aptly celebrated him as ''sportsman, raconteur, dog lover, genial host, Post Commodore, Regatta Committee member, skipper par excellence, cruising buff and all around Bon Vivant'' when they awarded him the Commodore Paul S. Bigelow Award in 1967. Peter had a long history of service to his community and his presence will be deeply missed. In addition to serving as Commodore of the Yacht Club, he was a Chief and life member of the Bellport Fire Department, captain of the Department's engine company. He was a member of the United Methodist Church. He was also a 30 year member of the Board of Directors at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital and served as Chairman of the Board from 1984 to 1988. Peter was one of the earliest proponents of Brookhaven's Hospice Program and was in the care of hospice and family members during his last days at home. A memorial service will be announced later.</p>
        <p>PAIGE-Peter. The Medical Staff, Board of Directors and Administration of Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center mourn the passing of our dear and beloved colleague and friend, Peter Paige. A member of the Board of Directors since 1964 and Chair of that Board 1984-87, and a pioneer in the efforts to build the Hospital since its earliest inception, his wise counsel and diligent efforts on behalf of the hospital will be sincerely missed. The Medical Center and all affiliated with it extend their sincerest condolences to his wife and family. Marion Bergman, M.D., President, Medical Staff Henry P. Read, Chairman, Board of Directors Thomas Ockers, President/CEO</p>
