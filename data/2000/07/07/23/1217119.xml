        <p>PLENTY of mutual fund managers call themselves growth or value investors, but Roland P. Whitcomb rejects those labels in favor of another: technology investor, pure and simple.</p>
        <p>''Technology is an independent style of investing,'' said Mr. Whitcomb, 42, the lead manager of the $799.1 million First American Technology fund. ''You get one-time innovations that sweep through the economy like automobiles in the 20's, television in the 50's or personal computers in the 90's.''</p>
        <p>The movements of these technological waves work against proponents of the two investing schools, Mr. Whitcomb contends.</p>
        <p>''When you enter a technology cycle, value investors get confused by the apparent high valuation of the stocks, because they underestimate the wave of innovation that's coming,'' he said. ''Growth investors often have trouble exiting the technology cycle, because they take the growth rate that has occurred and extrapolate it forward in a linear way.'' He added that ''the endgame of a technology stock is that it becomes a capital goods or a consumer durables stock.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitcomb gives each new technology cycle time to run. Investing too early, he said, is akin to reckless speculation.</p>
        <p>Insights like that have helped the fund catch the technology tide. The fund returned 66.6 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended July 14, compared with 53.8 percent for its technology peers, according to Morningstar Inc.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitcomb gets started by identifying new technologies in growing markets, and then works with his six industry analysts to pick the 80 to 110 stocks in the fund. The key issue, he said, is valuation.</p>
        <p>One way that Mr. Whitcomb avoids overpaying for a stock is by gauging the maturity of a technology company's market; a company in a growing market, of course, is likely to warrant a higher valuation than one in a mature market. He estimates a market's potential size, looking at the volume of products or services sold and forecasting the percentage of current customers who will need to upgrade their products or services. In particular, he looks for the ''inflection point'' -- where a market becomes more than 50 percent saturated and is due for slower growth.</p>
        <p>To value profitable companies that make actual products, he uses a conventional dividend discount model, projecting the company's future earnings and then discounting them back by using long-term bond rates. He then adjusts that discount to reflect a company's risk level.</p>
        <p>For unprofitable companies that nonetheless generate product revenue, he forecasts when they will turn profitable and then discounts the profit figure, taking into account net operating margins and any interim capital deficiencies.</p>
        <p>Most difficult to value are companies with recurring revenues, typically service companies. Here, he forecasts the revenue generated per customer, adjusting the figure for marketing and other start-up expenses, capital costs and ''churn'' created by customer turnover, and then discounts that figure back, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitcomb sells shares if a company's market turns out to be smaller than he had anticipated or if a company's fundamentals deteriorate. He also trims shares as a company approaches full valuation. The fund's annual turnover rate of 184 percent is high, he said, because the market has been volatile.</p>
        <p>He thinks that technology shares in general are pricey these days, after their rebound of the past two months, though he is still is optimistic about their long-term prospects. ''Everything is pretty expensive right now because we had a nice bounce,'' he said. ''But we're on the verge of a new personal computer cycle with Windows 2000, along with accelerating growth in telecommunications, capacity constraints among semiconductor and other component vendors and strong demand in the Asian markets.''</p>
        <p>One favorite profitable ''product''  company is Compaq Computer. ''It's a valuation play, because people have been ignoring the sector lately,'' he said. ''But we expect companies to buy a lot of Windows 2000-based servers.''</p>
        <p>Compaq's recent management changes and its cheap stock price, he said, make it a bargain. He expects revenue to grow 11 percent a year, on average, over the next three years.</p>
        <p>He bought shares this month at $25; they now trade at $28.0625, or 18.7 times the consensus earnings estimate of $1.49 a share for 2001.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER favorite is Broadvision, which makes software to help e-tailers track Internet customers. The stock hit a high of $90.67 on March 6 and now trades at $41.25, or 375 times Wall Street's earnings estimate of 11 cents a share for this year. The fund bought shares this month at $37.50.</p>
        <p>''We think putting mainstream companies on the Web is a really big market.'' he said. ''Broadvision is the biggest company in the group and may lose some market share, but the stock price is down a lot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitcomb also likes America Online, which the fund bought this month at $57, even as investors have begun to fret about the prospects for  online advertising. ''No one's sure what will happen short term, and they're worried that ad revenues on the Internet will slow down,'' he said. ''They might, but winners like AOL will take enough market share that it won't matter.''</p>
        <p>The merger deal with Time Warner will make AOL more powerful,  but there are risks in integrating two big companies, Mr. Whitcomb said.</p>
        <p>AOL now trades at $57.625, just over 100 times analysts' pre-merger earnings forecast of 56 cents a share for the year ending in June 2001.</p>
