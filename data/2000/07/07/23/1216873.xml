        <p>ONE of the cleverest moments in the clever score for Istvan Szabo's film ''Sunshine'' occurs toward the end, when old Uncle Gustave Sonnenschein returns home to Budapest from abroad. He goes to the piano, ostensibly to play the opening of Schubert's four-hand Fantasy in F minor, which has served as the movie's leitmotif. But to remind us that he is a socialist, the tune immediately turns into the ''Marseillaise.''</p>
        <p>This kind of thematic metamorphosis is at the core of the music of ''Sunshine.'' From the first bars, there is something oddly familiar about the score, and this for a reason. To create the main theme, the composer Maurice Jarre starts with Schubert's first five notes, which are just like those of the ''Marseillaise'' except that the fifth note returns to the first instead of repeating. Schubert, after a pause, reiterates the ''allons enfant'' pattern several times before ending the phrase with a seductive dip. Mr. Jarre goes right to the dip, in effect skipping a measure. To this torso he adds a new, expansive gesture reminiscent of his score for ''Lawrence of Arabia.''</p>

        <p>ONE of the cleverest moments in the clever score for Istvan Szabo's film ''Sunshine'' occurs toward the end, when old Uncle Gustave Sonnenschein returns home to Budapest from abroad. He goes to the piano, ostensibly to play the opening of Schubert's four-hand Fantasy in F minor, which has served as the movie's leitmotif. But to remind us that he is a socialist, the tune immediately turns into the ''Marseillaise.''</p>
        <p>This kind of thematic metamorphosis is at the core of the music of ''Sunshine.'' From the first bars, there is something oddly familiar about the score, and this for a reason. To create the main theme, the composer Maurice Jarre starts with Schubert's first five notes, which are just like those of the ''Marseillaise'' except that the fifth note returns to the first instead of repeating. Schubert, after a pause, reiterates the ''allons enfant'' pattern several times before ending the phrase with a seductive dip. Mr. Jarre goes right to the dip, in effect skipping a measure. To this torso he adds a new, expansive gesture reminiscent of his score for ''Lawrence of Arabia.''</p>
        <p>The Schubert fantasy is a particularly compelling choice for ''Sunshine.'' Written at the end of the composer's life, it is a remarkable piece, which goes against the grain. What begins simply as a kind of Biedermeier serenade turns into a work of great mystery and astonishing profundity, concluding, like Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony, with a double fugue.</p>
        <p>As Mozart did in his F minor Fantasy for mechanical organ, written 30 years earlier and also arranged for four hands, Schubert takes the genre into uncharted territory. In tone, his fantasy shares something with Mozart's 40th Symphony, yet the dotted rhythm recalls a march, with aspects simultaneously childlike, military and funereal. The opening is riddled with grace notes, suggesting -- appropriately for the film -- an exotic, Hungarian Gypsy origin. The phrases are irregular, and the seemingly wistful opening idea is immediately repeated with an unusual insistence. There is something inscrutable about this work.</p>
        <p>It projects a strangely ominous quality, a component of the film as well. When two characters perform the piece at the beginning, it seems to signify refined upper-middle-class contentment. Yet the paradise of the Sonnenscheins is threatened from inside (a quasi-incestuous love affair, various character flaws) and out (world wars, revolutions, anti-Semitism). Maternal curses abound; china cups break symbolically. Family members change their name from the German-Jewish Sonnenschein to the Hungarian Sors. (Hmm, now whose name does that sound like?) The family frolics, fights and flees for generations, from Franz Joseph's Vienna to Stalinist Budapest, with various progeny -- all played by Ralph Fiennes -- serving as an imperial court judge, an Olympic gold medalist and an interrogator for the Communist Party.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is more music than the Schubert fantasy and its offspring to back all this up. The score brilliantly weaves together many kinds of sounds. The first third of the film is particularly rich in musical variety, reflecting -- as Schubert's work does in microcosm -- the polyglot shimmer of the Hapsburg lands with a dazzling combination of Gypsy bands, Hungarian patriotic music, Strauss waltzes, Jewish liturgical chants and, as a kind of subsidiary theme, a glorious Hungarian love song, ''Spring Wind.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the musical score, there is a subtler blend of sounds. Chimes ring; clocks tick. Indeed, time is a major force in the movie, and the slightly metronomic aspect of the Schubert fantasy suggests that it may also be understood as a symbol of fate. In fact, it is only when the youngest Sonnenschein loses his watch (and fails to learn the piano) that he can begin his move toward freedom. At this point, music teachers, we get the major-key version of Schubert's theme.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the film has a message: to be free, you must be true to who you really are. This is linked to a pervasive distaste for assimilation. (A Hungarian officer says to a Sonnenschein: ''I told you to assimilate. I was wrong.'') Though not itself complex, this mandate has darker, unexplored implications. On one hand, it seems entirely positive: stand up for who you are; honor your traditions; do not give in to changing fashion. On the other hand, in Central Europe and elsewhere, such attitudes have quickly led to collections of armed camps with devastating results.</p>
        <p>But the film, as marvelous as it often is, has no room for such ambiguities. It is, after all, a Hollywood-style epic, ultimately more concerned with family drama and fornication than it is with metaphysical complexity or illuminating the great wash of history. And so, if the untutored cannot really distinguish between the 1953 ''doctors' plot'' in Russia and the 1956 Hungarian revolution, that hardly matters.</p>
        <p>As a result, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the nuances that have been bleached out of history in ''Sunshine'' have their perfect counterpart in the missing measure from Schubert's Fantasy in F minor. In this way, too, the film and the score are compatible, sharing a tone that tends to favor a certain sentimentality over more troubling and painful visions.</p>
        <p>My coda is just the sort of thing the ''industry'' probably expects from ivory-tower types, even those who live and work in Southern California and should know better. We are all aware by now that the movie business is about fame and illusion, but shouldn't Schubert get some credit for the score? Neither the soundtrack album (from BMG/Milan) nor the 15-seconds-of-fame Web zines that have provided reviews of it seem to know that Mr. Jarre's score owes a great debt to a rough contemporary of the first Sonnenschein we meet (who almost immediately gets blown up in the family's distillery): a short, curly-haired composer from the Hapsburg Empire, who had his own problems. (One data base says that the soundtrack ''starts with a piano minuet that quickly develops a Beethoven feel.'')</p>
        <p>I am rooting for Maurice Jarre to win an Oscar for his terrific score. But I hope he shares it with Schubert.</p>
