        <p>That freckle-faced, red-haired orphan girl with a knack for trouble is back.</p>
        <p>No, Little Orphan Annie is not about to star in her own hard-knock reality series. This is Anne of Green Gables fame, who has emerged from the novels of Lucy Maud Montgomery to take on a life of her own in a trilogy, now completed, of made-for-television films.</p>
        <p>Although similarly spunky and carrot-topped, the Canadian Anne opts for romantic books over a scruffy dog, lives on Prince Edward Island rather than Manhattan and finds true love instead of a doting daddy.</p>
        <p>The first of the trilogy, based on the 1908 novel ''Anne of Green Gables,'' was made in 1985. In it, viewers met a scrawny, impulsive girl who, in the words of Marilla, the elderly spinster who takes her in, could ''talk the hind leg off a mule.'' The sequel, ''Anne of Avonlea,'' culled from two of the seven books in the Anne series, was released in 1987.</p>
        <p>Kevin Sullivan, who adapted, produced and directed the first and second films, was surprised when audiences and broadcasters began asking about a trilogy. What happened to Anne and Gilbert? Did they get married?</p>
        <p>''Of course they got married,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''At the end of the sequel they are on a bridge holding hands.''</p>
        <p>But happily ever after isn't that easy when you are dealing with a character like Anne. Mr. Sullivan began to feel the urge to resolve the childhood insecurities that fueled her penchant for disaster. So he produced and wrote, with Laurie Pearson, the last of the trilogy, ''Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story,'' which has its premiere tonight at 9 on Channel 13.</p>
        <p>In the two-part film, directed by Stefan Scaini, Anne is teaching at an orphanage in Halifax and her betrothed, Gilbert Blythe, is studying medicine in New York. Megan Follows, who was 16 when the original was filmed, returns as Anne, along with a few other familiar but matured faces, including Jonathan Crombie as Gilbert and Schuyler Grant as Anne's best friend, Diana Barry.</p>
        <p>''It is a rare opportunity to go back and revisit a role, especially in film or television,'' Ms. Follows said. ''You often leave a role feeling that there is another facet to layer in.''</p>
        <p>And this story had plenty of new paths for Ms. Follows to explore. Though, besides the irrepressible characters, Montgomery's novels had precious little to do with the plot lines.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Sullivan points out, Montgomery's books are episodic and have too many characters to move easily to film, requiring any new production to rely on an original screenplay. The 20-year difference between the time of the books (set in the 1880's) and the films (set in the early 1900's) was another consideration. It meant that just as Anne and Gilbert begin their lives together they are pushed up against a World War I.</p>
        <p>The war served Mr. Sullivan's ideas of how Anne should grow. ''Part of growing up is learning how to love,'' he said, ''learning how to sacrifice, learning that everything isn't in your control.''</p>
        <p>The lessons begins in New York, where Anne is an editor at a publishing company and Gilbert works in a hospital. They both become disillusioned with their jobs, and, once again, return to Avonlea. Feeling that he could do more as a doctor abroad, Gil ships off to Europe, and Anne's reluctance to wait for his return leads her to war-ravaged London, the front lines in France and into the sort of adventure story that the New York publisher was looking for.</p>
        <p>''Anne's journey is about defining home for herself,'' Ms. Follows said. ''About it not being represented as a place, but being defined by her mate and then the addition of a new family member. Ultimately it is a love story. It just takes Anne a while to understand that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sullivan seemed bemused by the extent of the films' success. ''Who would have thought that Anne would become an international icon?'' he said. But the fact that ''Anne of Green Gables'' has been broadcast in more than 120 countries is not surprising, considering that Montgomery's books have been translated into 20 languages.</p>
        <p>About the enduring love for this feisty redhead, Ms. Follows said, ''I think the appeal of the original stories wasn't the ideal setting or the romance of it all, but of the impact that one person could have in the world, given that she had everything going against her.''</p>
