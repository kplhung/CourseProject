        <p>1. Silicon geeks and dot-commers may earn triple-digit billions, but the folks who really have the knack for spending -- the true nouveau riche, our Carringtons of the new Millennium -- are hip-hop impresarios like Puffy Combs (a). No stranger to extravagance, the Puffster knows how to wrap himself in the fabulousness of plush white fur and still walk with a swagger; how to give a girl a token of his affections (the $60,000 Franck Muller watch he reportedly presented to his very own Krystle, Jennifer Lopez); and how to make a memorable exit. Remember the snazzy Lincoln Navigator (b), which Puffy enlisted as an impromptu getaway car after last December's shootout at Manhattan's Club New York? (He still proclaims his innocence.) S.U.V.'s like that are today's celebrity vehicle of choice. For chic wheels of your own, call Romantique Limo, (212) 921-9444. $100 an hour plus gratuity.  2. Over-the-top 80's-style luxury was a keynote at the recent runway shows. Krystle and Alexis wannabes will look drop-dead elegant in this cozy sable vest ($18,500), silk blouse ($1,550) and caramel-and-gold skirt ($2,750). At Fendi, 720 Fifth Avenue.</p>

        <p>3. Just cashed in stock options? Hot-foot it over to Jimmy Choo's for these silver stilettos in rhinestones, satin and kidskin. The new new Manolo for the new new rich, Choo has fans among fashionistas like Elizabeth Hurley and Cate Blanchett. $650 at Jimmy Choo, 645 Fifth Avenue.  4. Daddy left you a bundle? Glitter and be gay in an 18-karat-gold Tiffany necklace and matching bracelet with diamonds set in platinum (a) -- $33,500 and $27,000 respectively -- at Tiffany &amp; Company, 2 East 57th Street. Or choose these bold gold-and-diamond earrings (b). $13,300 at H. Stern, 645 Fifth Avenue.  5. For ''Dynasty'' living Manhattan-style, try the 90th-floor penthouse of the Trump World Tower at United Nations Plaza. This space, with breathtaking views, occupies the top two floors, measures 18,000 square feet and boasts 20-foot-high, floor-to-ceiling glass. ''It's the tallest residential tower in the world,'' says the Donald. ''And these are the largest rooms built in New York since 1929.'' The price? A mere 38 mil. The aerie will be ready by May 2002. Blaine Trump, a sister-in-law, has already expressed interest.  6. Or set sail on the Mediterranean aboard Mouna Ayoub's 245-foot-long yacht, the Phocea, the most luxurious single-hull vessel afloat, with a computer in the V.I.P. stateroom, a gym, a sauna and a beauty salon where guests like Ursula Andress and Jack Nicholson have been known to wash the salt out of their hair. Can't wrangle an invite? Rent the ship for $200,000 from Neil Hornsby at Nigel Burgess Ltd. in London: 011-44-207-766-4300.  7. To repair sea-damaged skin, call for Cr me de la Mer. Invented by a NASA aerospace physicist who suffered severe facial burns when an experiment went awry, it's made from very specially treated sea kelp, vitamins and minerals that may soften your skin; at $1,000 for 16.5 ounces, it'll also stretch your budget. At Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.  8. Hey, big spender: Maybe you can't live like the rich, but you can at least dine like them at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House on Central Park South (a). Although it just opened, there's a three-month wait for the privilege of partaking in either the renowned French chef's tasting menu ($160 per bouche) or his  la carte dinner (around $250). And oenophiles, beware: a good burgundy could up the total to $800 each. Ducasse, however, pampers guests with such fab frissons as handbag stools (b), where ladies can park their $1,000 CJ Yoon satin evening clutches (available at Bergdorf Goodman). Make sure yours</p>
        <p>is stuffed with cash to cover the bill. And bon appetit!</p>
