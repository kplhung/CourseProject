        <p>I ONCE asked John Schlesinger if he would ever return to making the kind of small, authentic English films, like ''A Kind of Loving'' and ''Billy Liar,'' that made his name in the early 60's.</p>
        <p>''Why? We've done all that,'' he growled, speaking for himself and his fellow so-called kitchen sink realists, and we returned to talking about what was then Mr. Schlesinger's latest film, the slick American espionage thriller ''The Falcon and the Snowman.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough. Artists don't grow if they retrace their steps. The kitchen sink, too, is no longer a handy symbol for the social inequities and domestic pressures of British life. Britain has changed irrevocably in the 40 years since Mr. Schlesinger, Lindsay Anderson, Jack Clayton, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson, inspired by the literary example of the Angry Young Men and offended by the bourgeois values of the staid national cinema, made a brief series of socially aware films that depicted regional working-class life in all its grim (and occasionally funny) verisimilitude.</p>
        <p>The welfare state has metamorphosed, by way of Margaret Thatcher's privatization imperatives, into Tony Blair's post-industrial Cool Britannia. Mobile-phone realism, anyone?</p>
        <p>The rhythms of British life, however, do not alter as quickly as the political landscape, and in the last few years several talented directors have emerged with pain-infused realist dramas that get to the heart of working- and middle-class Britain. They include Gary Oldman's ''Nil by Mouth,'' Tim Roth's ''War Zone,'' Carine Adler's ''Under the Skin'' and two that will open here this fall, Lynne Ramsay's ''Ratcatcher'' and Shane Meadows's ''Room for Romeo Brass.'' Another, ''Wonderland,'' directed by Michael Winterbottom, opens on Friday.</p>
        <p>These directors do not belong to any manifesto-issuing group like the Danish Dogma 95 collective with its back-to-basics agenda, or, for that matter, the Free Cinema documentarists of the 50's, whose work led to the kitchen sink movement. Unlike that tireless agitator Ken Loach, they are driven by polemical concerns only in passing. Although Mr. Winterbottom and Mr. Meadows, for example, have shown they are not limited to particular themes, all the films just mentioned are linked by a realist or quasi-realist style and a preoccupation with the psychological legacies of parental abuse or absence, or, as in the case of ''Wonderland,'' parental warfare.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Loach's work has always rooted the political in the personal, and it is impossible to ignore the influence of domestic dramas like his ''Ladybird, Ladybird'' on ''Nil by Mouth'' and ''The War Zone'' (particularly since the actor Ray Winstone portrayed brutal father figures in all three). And there are traces of ''Ladybird, Ladybird'' and earlier Loach films like ''Up the Junction'' and ''Family Life'' in ''Wonderland'' and ''Under the Skin.''</p>
        <p>Whether directly or through osmosis, Mr. Roth and Mr. Oldman are indebted to Mike Leigh and especially Alan Clarke, directors they both worked for as actors. After many years as an eloquent director-for-hire in British television, Mr. Clarke capped his career with a series of pulsating dramas, including ''Scum'' (starring Mr. Winstone and banned by the BBC, which had financed it), ''Made in Britain'' (with Mr. Roth) and ''The Firm'' (with Mr. Oldman), that offered a caustic critique of the British social order. Since Mr. Clarke's death in 1990, his films have grown in critical stature, and he stands alongside Mr. Loach and Mr. Leigh as one of the seminal figures of British social realism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winterbottom's ''Wonderland'' unfolds over a November weekend in contemporary London, which it depicts as a locus of alienation, loneliness and despair. Laurence Coriat, the film's London-based writer, was a psychology student in her native France and, accordingly, her script lent itself to psychological rather than social realism. It focuses on three sisters and their brother, and their codependent parents (Kika Markham and Jack Shepherd), whose wretchedly antagonistic relationship implicitly indicates why their son is estranged and not one of their daughters seems capable of forging a relationship based on trust.</p>
        <p>Of the sisters, the shy cafe waitress Nadia (Gina McKee, who played a similar role in Mr. Leigh's ''Naked'') dates men from the personal ads and ends up being seduced and rejected by one of them; the willfully promiscuous Debbie (Shirley Henderson), a hairdresser, parks her son on her irresponsible ex-husband, who promptly loses him; and the pregnant teacher Molly (Molly Parker) cold-shoulders her live-in boyfriend for quitting his job, causing him to walk out. Their younger brother, Darren (Enzo Cilenti), agonizes over whether to call home as he passes through the city with his girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Thematically, Mr. Winterbottom's films, which also include ''Jude'' and ''Welcome to Sarajevo,'' deal with people who are trapped in some kind of prison, whether psychological or physical; stylistically, they have little in common. In ''Wonderland,'' he adopted a casually observational approach, filming the quotidian routines and mishaps of his characters with a hand-held camera as they struggle through the weekend, making a hash of their attempts to communicate with each other. Mr. Winterbottom was loath to acknowledge specific realist influences on ''Wonderland'' when we spoke in January at the Sundance Film Festival, where the movie had its American premiere.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't consciously trying to emulate 60's kitchen sink realism,'' he said. ''The fact that 'Wonderland's' characters happen to be living mainly in council estates in South London and struggling economically isn't the heart of the film. I was more interested in exploring the emotional connections between people in a family who rarely meet, and in capturing the noise and excitement of London and the exhaustion of trying to keep your head above water in a place where you've got seven million people around you whose lives you don't know. You sit next to them on the tube, live next door to them in a block of flats and walk past them on the street, but you never expect to have any connection with them.''</p>
        <p>Superficially, ''Wonderland'' resembles Mr. Loach's films -- a ''Riff-Raff,'' say, or ''Raining Stones'' -- but a closer examination reveals that its style is heightened above and beyond Loachian documentary realism. Like ''Nil by Mouth'' and ''Under the Skin,''  ''Wonderland'' is carried along by a fly-on-the-wall look, charged with an unsettling lyricism. Scenes of Debbie's son and his dad leaving a soccer match, and in Soho, where Nadia and Molly's boyfriend each gloomily wander, render the metropolis as a threatening human jungle. It is not entirely faceless: Mr. Winterbottom had Sean Bobbitt, his cinematographer, pick out lonely individuals in the crowd, making us wonder about their stories. But he did something Mr. Loach would never do: using time-lapse photography, he turned Soho's hordes into an inhuman tumult moving at warp speed, overlaid by an alternately plaintive and mournful Michael Nyman score.</p>
        <p>''To me, a film's realistic if it somehow expresses something that's truthful,'' Mr. Winterbottom said. ''But I don't think there's an objective way of saying one film is truthful and another isn't. 'Wonderland' is a naturalistic film in most respects. One thing I wanted to do stylistically was have moments in it where we weren't just observing details but somehow trying to evoke a sense of the characters' inner lives, their aspirations and dreams. That's why I used the time-lapse photography and Michael Nyman's score.''</p>
        <p>Lynne Ramsay's ''Ratcatcher'' is set in and around a decrepit housing project and a polluted nearby canal in Glasgow in the 70's; a national refuse workers' strike (also seen in the recent Sex Pistols documentary ''The Filth and the Fury'') has led to an infestation of rats in the neighborhood. In the film's first few minutes, a boy drowns in the canal. The story then follows 12-year-old James (William Eadie), who shoved the boy into the water. James befriends a hapless teenager, Margaret Anne (Leanne Mullen), who is picked on by a local gang, then he feels betrayed when he sees her having sex with her persecutors. James's father is beaten up and takes it out on his wife. James himself jumps into the canal.</p>
        <p>From such human squalor, Ms. Ramsay, who grew up in a similar Glasgow environment, has fashioned a movie that is equal parts realism and impressionism. Unlike Mr. Winterbottom, she sought out and framed details -- the scab on Margaret Anne's knee, her spectacles at the bottom of the canal, James protectively pulling his mother's ripped nylon stocking over her bare toe -- that are stark in their realness but more than three-dimensional. ''I tried to think of the emotional core of every shot,'' Ms. Ramsay said recently. ''I wanted to get details that trigger a memory. A lot of people like the scene in which James looks at Margaret Anne's scab because it's quite sensual and reminds them of when they constantly had scabs on their knees.''</p>
        <p>ALTHOUGH ''Ratcatcher'' often looks and feels like real life, any notion that it is a ''realistic'' film is confused by the fact that it appears to operate on two intersecting planes of reality, the conscious and the unconscious.</p>
        <p>When James follows his sister out of town on a bus, he drifts off to a new housing estate situated among wide fields that might have been photographed in Nebraska: the sequence has the quality of a reverie. Then later, in a Magritte-style scene, James's family carries its furniture through the fields to the estate to claim their little slice of heaven -- but there's a sense that this is only a visualization of James's futile wish for a life that isn't brutish and disease-ridden.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the film, council inspectors visit James's family's untidy flat and deny them a new home -- a typically Loachian intimation of how the working class is habitually betrayed by the authorities who are supposed to help them. The runtish James is also reminiscent of the unloved schoolboy who finds solace in the company of a kestrel in Mr. Loach's ''Kes.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Loach, Ms. Ramsay primarily works with nonprofessional actors. Stylistically, however, the British filmmakers who most affected her were Bill Douglas (''My Childhood,''  ''My Ain Folk''), Mr. Clarke and Nicolas Roeg, while she also credits the influence of the American avant-garde director Maya Deren and such European heavyweights as Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder and Truffaut.</p>
        <p>''People think 'Ratcatcher' is part of the tradition of British social realism because of the working-class world in which it's set,'' she said. ''If it offers an alternative view of British culture compared with most of the films that are made these days, then, yeah, it is connected to that kitchen sink tradition, but I never sat down and said, 'I'm going to make a social realist film.' When I make my films, I go off on a different planet, really.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ramsay, who previously directed highly regarded shorts (''Small Deaths'' and ''Gasman''), added that she did not wish to be thought of as a Scottish filmmaker. The regionalist spirit of the 60's kitchen sink films, however, survives in the work of Shane Meadows, whose grass-roots cinema is based in and around the Midlands -- not that his stories about the vicissitudes of emotionally or economically disenfranchised teenagers and young adults aren't universally applicable. Mr. Meadows's films, both jaunty and poignant, share with Mike Leigh's a fascination for quirks of personality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meadows was about to start work on a Welsh western when a conversation with his writing partner Paul Fraser steered them toward an autobiographical story about a temporary break in their long friendship during adolescence.</p>
        <p>''A Room for Romeo Brass'' depicts a crisis in the life of pugnacious 12-year-old Romeo (Andrew Shim). He not only deserts his next-door-neighbor, Knocks (Ben Marshall), when the latter is hospitalized but, angered by his itinerant father's decision to return home, takes up with the 30-ish misfit, Morel (Paddy Considine), who has been courting his sister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meadows's first feature, the black-and-white ''TwentyFourSeven'' (1997), was shot in an uneasy blend of realist and impressionist styles, but ''Romeo Brass'' returns him to the vibrant naturalism of his short films, ''Small Time'' and ''Where's the Money Ronnie?,'' which were shot on video. Of all the films by new British directors about real-life situations, Mr. Meadows's have the strongest tang of verisimilitude.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Winterbottom and Ms. Ramsay, Mr. Meadows candidly admits he was directly influenced by the Loach-Leigh-Clarke era, which achieved its apotheosis in television drama during the 70's and 80's, a time when the British film industry was enduring one of its periodic slumps.</p>
        <p>''You hear Martin Scorsese talking about the first time he went to see great movies in these huge cinemas in New York,'' Mr. Meadows said, ''but to me a cinema was some seedy place in the back streets of Stoke-on-Trent where you went twice a year at the most to see films like 'Grease.' Except for the likes of 'Chariots of Fire' and 'Absolute Beginners,' there was no cinema culture in England when I was growing up. And yet I would come in from the youth club on  Thursday night and on the telly there would be a film about a pregnant woman and the guy who has come round to read the gas meter and who obviously fancies her, and they'd sit in a room in a block of flats and not talk. And you'd think, 'Who the hell made this?' You wouldn't know if it was a story or a documentary but you'd sit there glued to it.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''The one thing I felt was missing from these incredibly hard-hitting dramas was comedy. They were very real but they seemed to take themselves too seriously, and I remember that although life was tough where I grew up, people's humor came through, and that's what I thought I could bring to my films when I started making them. You see it in the cruel way the two boys treat Morel when they think they can take advantage of him in 'Romeo Brass.' Even if a film's based on reality, it doesn't have to be a depressing state of affairs.''</p>
