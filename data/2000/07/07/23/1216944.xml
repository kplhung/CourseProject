        <p>NORTH FORK BANCORP'S chairman and chief executive, John A. Kanas, returned to his spacious Melville office following a sometimes raucous annual shareholders' meeting of Dime Bancorp, slipped off his jacket and tie and slumped into a chair.</p>
        <p>''Those guys got crushed,'' he said with a trace of a smile, referring to the board of the Dime, parent of Dime Savings Bank, which has been resisting North Fork's takeover attempt since it was launched four months ago. ''The shareholders were really rough on them.''</p>
        <p>North Fork had asked Dime shareholders to vote to ''withhold authority'' from five Dime nominees up for election to the board, and Mr. Kanas announced at the July 14 meeting that by his tally, more than 70 percent of the shareholders had voted with North Fork.</p>
        <p>Dime officials would not confirm the vote, saying independent auditors would count the ballots and the official results would be released on July 28. They also disputed the meaning of the dissenting votes, and the takeover battle seems unlikely to be resolved soon. But Mr. Kanas said his unofficial tally meant that North Fork, perhaps the hardest-charging business on Long Island, was a step closer to winning its hostile bid for the Dime, and with it an entry to the big leagues of the New York banking business.</p>
        <p>If the merger takes place, the combined bank would be the largest in terms of market share in Nassau, Suffolk, Brooklyn and Queens. Currently, Dime is tied for third place with Astoria in those counties -- behind Chase Manhattan and GreenPoint -- and North Fork is No. 8.</p>
        <p>''If you combine them, they leapfrog to No. 1 ,'' said Kevin T. Timmons, a bank analyst at First Albany Corp., a regional brokerage company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanas has had plenty of practice at takeovers. North Fork's decision to go after Dime came days after it completed the acquisition of Reliance Bancorp -- the parent company of Reliance Federal Savings -- on Feb. 18 and JSB Financial -- the parent company of Jamaica Savings -- on Feb. 29.</p>
        <p>Those moves brought to 12 the number of mergers North Fork has completed in the last dozen years. They have transformed what was once a small East End bank into a regional institution with $16 billion in assets. U.S. Banker, a leading industry publication, ranked it No. 1 this year among the nation's bank and thrift companies, based on its average return on equity and its earnings per share growth.</p>
        <p>''They certainly have been one of the most aggressive acquirers in the nation,'' Mr. Timmons said.</p>
        <p>But the Dime is the first to resist North Fork's overture, and it is by far the biggest fish North Fork has tried to swallow, bigger than North Fork itself. North Fork, with 154 branches in Suffolk, Nassau, Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Westchester, Rockland and Fairfield, Conn., has $8.9 billion in deposits and $16 billion in assets. The Dime has fewer branches -- 127 of them scattered among Nassau, Suffolk, the five boroughs, Westchester, Rockland and New Jersey -- but it has $14.3 billion in deposits and total assets of $25 billion.</p>
        <p>At the July 14 Dime shareholders' meeting, Mr. Kanas read from a letter sent to him two years ago by the Dime's C.E.O., Lawrence J. Toal, extolling the virtues of a Dime-North Fork merger, although the talks then did not lead to such a union.</p>
        <p>''A combination of Dime and North Fork,'' Mr. Toal wrote, ''would create the premier regional consumer and business banking franchise in the greater New York area with a nationwide, high-quality mortgage banking and consumer lending distribution capability nationwide.</p>
        <p>''The resulting bank, with a market capitalization in excess of $7 billion, would be the dominant New York area regional consumer/business bank with a reputation of service quality and customer care. The bank would be well positioned to be the major consolidator in the greater New York area, with the objective of becoming a $50 billion plus financial institution in the near future.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanas said nothing has changed in two years to persuade him that the deal is no longer desirable. Mr. Timmons agreed, saying that a combined Dime and North Fork would be ''valuable on an operating basis and as a possible acquisition down the road. If this deal goes through, North Fork will have transformed itself from being a relatively small, local player into being a major force in the New York area.''</p>
        <p>The proposed takeover has attracted the attention of even bigger fish, including FleetBoston Financial Group, which has pledged to take a $250 million stake in a combined Dime-North Fork.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanas said the decision to go after the Dime again was made after investors sent Dime stock plunging from $19 a share to below $12 earlier this year on news of its planned merger with New Jersey-based Hudson United Bank in a deal valued at about $1.3 billion. He noted that North Fork had bought 690,000 shares of Dime stock last year at $19 a share.</p>
        <p>''I said that if investors thought the Hudson deal was worth only $12 a share, I would offer Dime shareholders $17 a share,'' Mr. Kanas said, adding that North Fork had offered to swap each of Dime's 111 million outstanding shares for 0.9302 of its own shares plus $2 in cash per share. At the time, the North Fork bid was valued at $2.3 billion.</p>
        <p>The North Fork announcement April 6 -- just days before Dime shareholders were to meet to approve the Hudson United deal --  prompted the Dime to postpone its shareholders' meeting and to terminate the Hudson United deal on April 28. It also boosted Dime's stock price from $12 to $16, noted James M. Ackor, a bank analyst at Tucker Anthony, a Boston-based investment bank.</p>
        <p>''It's very clear,'' Mr. Ackor said, ''that the emergence of North Fork as a hostile suitor broke up the Hudson United deal, which Dime shareholders were not convinced was a good deal. Arguably, it was a lousy deal for the shareholders of Dime.''</p>
        <p>From the start, Dime officials have refused to meet with Mr. Kanas to discuss his offer. They have insisted that North Fork's projections of benefits from the deal were overly ambitious and that a merger would cause antitrust problems.</p>
        <p>After terminating the Hudson Union deal, Dime conducted what it called ''an exhaustive, two-month-long review of available strategic options, which included a careful analysis of the current merger and acquisitions market for financial institutions, as well as discussions with potential bidders.'' It concluded, it said, that ''a sale of the company now would not optimize stockholder value.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ackor questioned the seriousness of that search, saying he believed that ''if you hang a for-sale sign around a franchise that is believed to be very attractive, there would be parties interested in acquiring it. To say that they have completed a comprehensive evaluation and come up with nothing suggests to me that they didn't try that hard.''</p>
        <p>But Thomas K. Brown, C.E.O. of bankstocks.com, an investment and research company specializing in the financial services industry, said he found it ''inconceivable that Larry Toal would say nobody was interested at the right price'' if it were not true.</p>
        <p>''They did sign confidentiality agreements with several other banks,'' said Mr. Brown, who argued at the shareholders' meeting that the Dime was justified in not pursuing North Fork's offer. ''The primary reason why those other banks elected not to pursue the Dime was that it was the wrong time for them, in the sense that the market is penalizing acquirers today and they feared their stock price would get hammered.''</p>
        <p>A Dime spokeswoman said Mr. Toal and other senior Dime management were unavailable for comment. But she referred to the comments Mr. Brown made during the stockholder's meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown argued that a North Fork acquisition was too risky. He said the Dime is seven times larger than any other deal done by North Fork and three times larger than the cumulative total of all the deals North Fork has done to date.</p>
        <p>''I see this over and over again,'' he said in an interview. ''Management teams who are successful in rolling up small acquisitions say 'let's do a big deal,' and inevitably they fail. They are not the same. They have not proven that they are good at integrating a franchise that is this large on an absolute basis or, more importantly, relative to the size of North Fork.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown said that a $100 billion organization would have a reasonably good chance of successfully integrating a $25 billion business. But North Fork, with $16 billion in assets, ''is trying to take over a $25 billion organization, and the chances of success are fairly small in normal situations. But here we are talking about a hostile situation, and this is where you need the management of the Dime to stick around even more.''</p>
        <p>He added that he believed Dime shareholders withheld their vote from Dime board members out of frustration with Dime's refusal to talk with North Fork.</p>
        <p>''I think Dime could have done a better explanation of why they refused,'' Mr. Brown said. ''You may not agree with their explanation, but they have one.''</p>
        <p>The battle now hinges on control of the Dime's board of directors. Mr. Kanas said the five board members from whom shareholders voted to ''withhold authority'' must stand for election again next year, along with another five of the board's 16 members. Next year, Mr. Kanas promised, he would run his own slate of candidates selected in consultation with Dime's major institutional shareholders. He said he would have run his own slate this year, but the date for filing expired by the time his board decided to seek a merger in late March.</p>
        <p>A Dime spokeswoman said that because the shareholders electing to ''withhold authority'' did not actually vote against the candidates (it was not a ballot option), the five directors -- including Mr. Toal -- had been elected to three-year terms and did not have to stand for re-election next year.</p>
        <p>North Fork responded to that claim by suing the Dime in Delaware, where the bank was incorporated. It asked a court to rule that by their action the shareholders had rejected the Dime's slate and that although the directors may continue to serve on an interim basis, their seats must be filled in new elections no later than next year's annual meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kanas said North Fork has spent about $9 million in its quest for the Dime and that the Dime has spent about $34 million in response, including legal fees to fight it and a $15 million termination fee to Hudson United. He said that based upon what the Dime has promised to pay -- including a 25 percent increase in severance pay for all employees -- the cost of selling it would rise to more than $200 million.</p>
        <p>''Dime has spent a lot of money keeping its shareholders from making money,'' said Mr. Kanas, adding that he would not be deterred. ''We paid a high price for admission to the movie and we're going to stay to see the credits.''</p>
