        <p>The Suffolk County Parks Department has bought a much-disputed 36-acre parcel of land in Stony Brook, blocking a planned housing development.</p>
        <p>The land, Forsythe Meadow, was the property of the Ward Melville Heritage Organization, a local nonprofit historic-preservation group that contracted to sell the land to housing developers, Klein &amp; Eversoll, in 1996.</p>
        <p>In early 1999, public outcry over the sale intensifed when Klein &amp; Eversoll announced a plan to build 40 homes on the site. In April 1999, the Suffolk County Legislature voted to include Forsythe Meadows in its Greenways program, allowing the county to buy the land for preservation.</p>
        <p>Louise Harrison, co-founder of the Coalition to Save Stony Brook Village, which lobbied public officials to save Forsythe Meadows, said the preservation of the land was ''a community effort that demonstrated democracy at work.''</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County executive, Robert Gaffney, said the acquisition was part of the county's ongoing plan to acquire land in more developed communities like Stony Brook and Huntington to balance efforts at land preservation on the East End.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harrison said the fight is not over. The Heritage Organization is still attempting to sell six acres adjacent to Forsythe Meadows to the United States Postal Service for expansion of its Stony Brook branch.</p>
        <p>''That land sits on top of a water table that feeds into Stony Brook Harbor, and runoff from that land affects the health of the harbor,'' Ms. Harrison said.</p>
        <p>The only development that will be allowed in Forsythe Meadows will be nature trails and information kiosks.</p>
