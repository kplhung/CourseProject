        <p>Just when it was supposed to be safe to go back into Democratic waters, the sharks are out again. And it seems only a matter of time before body parts begin washing up on shore.</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine's smashing defeat of Jim Florio in the Senate primary last month was supposed to have put an end to the blood feud between the northern and central New Jersey forces led by State Senators Raymond J. Lesniak and John Lynch, and the South Jersey faction headed by George E. Norcross, the Camden County power broker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norcross, it was said, was through. All that was missing was for someone like Vice President Al Gore to gather the humiliated chieftains together with their vanquishers, pass around a peace pipe, mumble something about the good of the party, and offer a token tribute to the South.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norcross must have been smoking from a different pipe. It turned out that throughout the Senate race, while he was hyperactively engineering Mr. Florio's campaign, and Senator Robert Torricelli was taking a hand in Mr. Corzine's candidacy from behind the scenes, the two had never stopped talking.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, Mr. Torricelli was bursting into the gubernatorial race, and Mr. Norcross, of all people, was at his side, promising to deliver a solid South for the soon-to-be senior senator.</p>
        <p>No one knows yet whether Mr. Torricelli will be able to bully his way to another uncontested primary, or whether Mayor James E. McGreevey of Woodbridge, who believes Mr. Torricelli's talk of a statewide draft movement is merely so much huffing and puffing, will successfully call his bluff. For now, it is safe to say that if their confrontation drags on for too many more weeks, it will be difficult for Mr. Torricelli to maintain the air of invincibility that he seems to prize.</p>
        <p>Their rapidly escalating conflict -- an aide to Mr. Torricelli called it a ''family thing'' -- has caught staff members, allies and fund-raisers in the crossfire. Richard McGrath, Senator Torricelli's able spokesman, had promised to return to work for Mr. McGreevey in September; after delicately fielding calls for both men for two weeks without alienating anyone, he ran for cover, taking a few days off last week. Brad Lawrence, a campaign consultant whose clients include Mr. Corzine, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. McGreevey and Representative Rush Holt, boldly stepped into the fray on Mr. McGreevey's side, lacing into Mr. Torricelli on matters ranging from his vulnerability to his basic electoral clout.</p>
        <p>But what has been most delicious for those lucky enough to be watching this from a safe distance has been to watch old grudges play out, and to speculate about how others will get exorcised, if the Democratic Party gets swept up into a statewide civil war.</p>
        <p>One of the few elected officials whose names Mr. Torricelli brandished as supporting him for governor last week was Representative Frank E. Pallone, the ranking Democrat in Monmouth County. That seemed to make plenty of sense. Mr. Pallone's feud with Mr. Lynch, the de facto boss of Middlesex County, dates back more than a decade, to their days together in the state Senate; in 1992, Mr. Pallone survived a primary challenge from a Assemblyman Bob Smith of Piscataway. And  recently, Mr. Lynch tried to replace Vincent Scudiery, the Monmouth Democratic chairman, with his own ally, only to be defeated 2-1.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. McGreevey concede that Mr. Pallone can give Monmouth County to Mr. Torricelli. But they wonder if he will. ''When Frank Pallone became the only congressman not to endorse Rob Andrews for governor in 1997, he was threatened with the one thing that matters more to him than anything: his congressional seat,'' said a lobbyist backing Mr. McGreevey. ''He talks about how big he is, but the reason he has a safe seat is Middlesex. And all they have to do is move more of his district into Middlesex, and he loses a primary.''</p>
        <p>Representative Robert Menendez would seem to be the most likely congressman to back Mr. McGreevey. After all, he still resents Mr. Torricelli for offering, then withdrawing, his support of Mr. Menendez when the Union City Democrat was hoping for the nomination that Mr. Corzine eventually won. Aides say the two have not talked since then, and barely acknowledge each other in the Capitol corridors. And as a forceful orator who is the highest-ranking Hispanic politician, Mr. Menendez could do much damage to Mr. Torricelli's reputation should he speak out against him nationally.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Torricelli's supporters say Mr. Menendez may be even more eager to get back at Mr. Lesniak, whose influence has soared in Mr. Menendez's base since his law firm hired Mayor Raul Garcia of Union City, a bitter rival of Mr. Menendez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Menendez is widely viewed as a deserving candidate if Mr. Torricelli is elected governor and needs to appoint his successor to the Senate. ''I don't know if he'll pin Torricelli down,'' said one ranking Democratic official, acknowledging Mr. Menendez may not trust any promises the senator makes right now. ''But what's his option if its McGreevey?''</p>
        <p>As for the inscrutable Mr. Norcross, he humbly insists that he has no thirst for revenge at all. ''Revenge is for those that are insecure with themselves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His motivation, then?</p>
        <p>''Winning.''</p>
