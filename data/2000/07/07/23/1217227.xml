        <p>I grew up on Pleasant Avenue in East Harlem, the wise-guy capital of the world.</p>
        <p>I was holding my father's hand on the summer morning when Francis Ford Coppola and James Caan visited the old neighborhood to film a scene for the first ''Godfather'' movie.</p>
        <p>All the guys from the ''old men's club'' were out in their skimpy T-shirts that morning, sipping cappuccino from plastic cups, their diamond pinky rings glaring in the mean sun. Jimmy the Cat. Vito the Bat. Patti Apples. Talk about filming on location.</p>
        <p>In the scene, Sonny Corleone, played by Mr. Caan, kicks the wise out of his wise guy brother-in-law. Casting agents on the set were offering $50 to any kid who wanted to be an extra, asking them to simply play in front of a fire hydrant.</p>
        <p>''Those are all my friends,'' I said. ''Dad, I wanna go.''</p>
        <p>''No,'' my father said flatly.</p>
        <p>Hearing this, a gentleman who had earned the nickname Joey Aggravation rushed over to my dad from the Pleasant Tavern and shrieked, ''C'mon Frankie, let the kid go!''</p>
        <p>''No,'' my dad said again, squeezing my hand. ''You're not a gangster.''</p>
        <p>That's the closest I ever got to being in a movie, especially the kind of movie that romanticized the lifestyles of the kind of people I grew up with, the men and women whose entire lives, it seemed, were played to a Sinatra soundtrack.</p>
        <p>Almost 30 years later, I got in line for another part. I was one of thousands who showed up at Harrison High School today for a much-publicized casting call for those interested in auditioning for parts in the hit HBO series ''The Sopranos,'' which happens to be my favorite.</p>
        <p>With several relatives in tow, I arrived at the high school at 9 a.m. only to find that I wasn't the first early bird.</p>
        <p>Thousands of young, cigar-chomping men in muscle T-shirts and women with tall hairdos and spiked heels were already there, the dizzying smells of perfume and hair spray in the hot air.</p>
        <p>By that time, Lt. Charles Trucillo of the Harrison Police Department estimated, 4,000 or 5,000 people were already in line.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Trucillo said 400 to 500 people had slept in front of the school overnight to improve their odds of successfully dropping off their portfolios.</p>
        <p>Using the power of my connections -- my ID card from The New York Times, where I work as a news assistant -- I broke ranks to negotiate a better deal somewhere up the line.</p>
        <p>Looking for the right place to jump in, I spotted a large man in a silk suit. His name was Lou Roca. Other than the fact that he was wearing handcuffs to the casting call, and handing out business cards with the words ''You Lookin' at Me?'' written in bold letters across the front, he seemed like a harmless guy.</p>
        <p>''You got a problem with me standing here, pal?'' I asked with a sly smile. ''I'm with the press.''</p>
        <p>''Make me an offer I can't refuse,'' said Mr. Roca, who made the trip all the way from New Castle, Del.</p>
        <p>''You can stand here if you get a message to Tony Soprano for me,'' said Mr. Roca, referring to the lead character in the series, played by James Gandolfini. ''Tell him I can help him with his family problems. I can be on the muscle end of the family, the fixer. I can make things go away.''</p>
        <p>By 9:45 a.m., the lines behind me had snaked down and around six city blocks. I thought about my sister Donna, who could play Carmela Soprano's dark-haired sister, waiting way back in line for a chance that might never come.</p>
        <p>I know that feeling, which is why I worked the deal with ''Lou Rocks,'' as Mr. Roca calls himself.</p>
        <p>Just before 10:30, when the doors were scheduled to open, I made my first contact, bumping into Henry Bronchtein, a co-producer and production manager for ''The Sopranos.'' He offered an explanation for the enormous turnout for the hugely popular show, which recently garnered 18 Emmy nominations, about Tony Soprano, who copes with the problems of everyday family life while struggling to maintain his status as a mob boss in the suburbs of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''What happened was, we were going to do a casting call and announce it in a couple of small papers, expecting maybe a thousand people, but then it got picked up by Regis and Howard Stern, and we started to get a lot of phone calls,'' Mr. Bronchtein said.</p>
        <p>''People were calling us, saying they were flying in from other parts of the country, and many of them slept here overnight,'' he said. ''We got a call from a guy from New Mexico who wanted directions to Harrison from Newark Airport.''</p>
        <p>By the time my conversation had ended with Mr. Bronchtein, police officers were saying that the crowds had swelled to nearly 20,000 people. [The police later gave an official crowd estimate of 14,000, a number slightly higher than the population of Harrison.]</p>
        <p>At 10:45, I arrived at the steps of the school's gymnasium, and as I began to head toward the casting directors -- men were in one line, women in another -- I tapped into a few conversations some of my would-be gangster friends were engaging in.</p>
        <p>''Break a leg,'' Joe Oliveto of Roosevelt Island, N.Y., said to another man on his way to meeting a casting director.</p>
        <p>''What?'' asked the man, unsure about Mr. Oliveto's remark. ''You talking to me?''</p>
        <p>As I got closer to my second chance at the big time, I heard a young assistant casting director, Jarred Bryant, ask a bald man with a big belly, 40-ish, ''Are you in the business?''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' said the man, ''I'm in the business.''</p>
        <p>''What have you acted in?'' asked Mr. Bryant.</p>
        <p>''Oh, not that business,'' said the man, smiling wide. ''I'm in the business.''</p>
        <p>Then it was my turn.</p>
        <p>''Any acting experience?''</p>
        <p>''Uh, no,'' I said shyly. ''But almost. Thirty years ago, I . . .''</p>
        <p>''Well, thanks, and maybe we'll give you a call,'' said Mr. Bryant, dropping my 5-by-7 glossy and a brief information form into a large pile.</p>
        <p>Stepping outside, I heard an HBO official shouting into a bullhorn, telling all the men in silk suits, and all the women in high heels and short skirts, that they were closing the doors.</p>
        <p>HBO officials offered those who had missed their chance to see a casting agent an address to mail in their mini-bios.</p>
        <p>I worked my way back through the crowd, and went home.</p>
        <p>I told my wife that if Tony Soprano called, I had a message for him.</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 25, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about a casting call for the HBO television series ''The Sopranos'' misspelled the surname of a co-producer and production manager in some copies. He is Henry Bronchtein, not Brunchtein.</p>
