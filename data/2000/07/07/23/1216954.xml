        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joseph N. Straus's article in Musical Quarterly on the ''myth'' of ''serial 'tyranny' '' hails from the prayer book of the ''numbers-don't-lie'' sect of music scholarship, displaying a quaintly modern faith in empirical methods as capable of uncovering important truths about human activity [''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?'' by Anthony Tommasini, July 9]. I do not share this faith. His piece does succeed, however (and unfortunately), in once again stirring up a barely simmering pot of old gruel: yet another contentious discussion of the 1950's and 60's avant-garde.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joseph N. Straus's article in Musical Quarterly on the ''myth'' of ''serial 'tyranny' '' hails from the prayer book of the ''numbers-don't-lie'' sect of music scholarship, displaying a quaintly modern faith in empirical methods as capable of uncovering important truths about human activity [''Midcentury Serialists: The Bullies or the Besieged?'' by Anthony Tommasini, July 9]. I do not share this faith. His piece does succeed, however (and unfortunately), in once again stirring up a barely simmering pot of old gruel: yet another contentious discussion of the 1950's and 60's avant-garde.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tommasini is quite right to point out that the ill-defined ghost of modernist hegemony probably did as much scary spooking in the 70's (and even early 80's, as I can personally attest) as it did in the 50's and 60's. And it probably haunted more manifestly in the dark corners of ''classrooms . . . and lunch hangouts'' than in the tenure decisions and other brightly lit phenomena that provide observable data for Mr. Straus's calculations.</p>
        <p>But I find the trench warfare imagery Mr. Tommasini uses to be distinctly unprofitable. The hoary culture-as-battlefield metaphor that is so easily deployed in these situations needs to be retired. Its continued use tricks us into expending our (often sadly impoverished) resources on body counts and post-mortems instead of on tilling the defiantly verdant fields of musical activity in this country.</p>
        <p>Surely the precious institutional and intellectual capital of the new music world is better invested in the bracing variety of today's work than in disputing crude characterizations of the lifework of composers active half a century ago.</p>
