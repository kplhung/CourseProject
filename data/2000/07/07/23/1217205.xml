        <p>Uncusto marily, the two former Yankees  both, it happens, coming from Florida -- paid for their own flights, dug into their own pockets for rental cars and lugged their own luggage to the hotel to play in four games for, yes, the Somerset Patriots, an independent team ensconced in the middle of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Both Tim Raines, the outfielder, and Pat Kelly, the second baseman, had been cut from the Yankees and the Angels, respectively, in spring training and, after illness and injuries, it appeared that the sun had sunk on their playing careers.</p>
        <p>Raines, at 40 and a veteran of 21 major league seasons with 4 teams, was sitting home in Lake Mary, Fla., organizing the opening in late summer of the Tim Raines Baseball School in nearby Sanford, when he received a phone call in June from Bob Watson, the former Yankee general manager and now chairman of the selection committee for the United States Olympic baseball team.</p>
        <p>''Tim,'' Watson said, ''do you think you can still play?'</p>
        <p>''Why, yes,'' replied Raines.</p>
        <p>''Well, do you want to play?''</p>
        <p>''Where?''</p>
        <p>''In Bridgewater.''</p>
        <p>''Bridgewater!''</p>
        <p>''With hopes of making the Olympic team.''</p>
        <p>''Oh,'' said Raines.</p>
        <p>Kelly, in Tampa, had received a similar call from Watson, while at home with his wife, Rebecca, who had given birth on March 31, to their first child, Charlotte. ''I was just home playing dad when Bob called,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kelly, at 32 and a primarily fringe nine-year major league player with four teams, had retired from baseball after a last attempt with the Angels last spring, and after a third operation on his right shoulder, the one he uses to throw.</p>
        <p>''Bob knew that Rebecca is from Australia, and that her family still lives in Adelaide,'' Kelly said. ''And since the Olympics are in Sydney this year, he thought I might have a special interest in trying out for the team and going there.'' He laughed, recalling this. ''When I told Rebecca, she said, 'Get that arm going!' ''</p>
        <p>So here he was, before the game last Tuesday evening, in the dugout and wearing the pinstripes of the Somerset Patriots. And Raines, a seven-time All-Star, was nearby. Each was hoping to impress the selection committee, to show not only that they have retained a semblance of their hitting and fielding skills, but that they were also truly dedicated to contributing to the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>''And if I had to come here to do that,'' Raines said, ''I thought it would be worth the try. What an opportunity -- to have a chance at an Olympic gold medal, to go along with my World Series rings. The Olympics were always a dream for me, but making the major leagues was a bigger dream. And I achieved that. And the Olympics were always held during the baseball season, and they were always for amateurs, so there was no chance for me. Now there is. Now everything has changed.''</p>
        <p>Kelly said, ''To be wearing the U.S.A. across your chest, to be representing your country, is an honor. I thought my shoulder would hold up, and so I wanted to give myself a shot at making the team. And it's my last chance to play in an organized setting.''</p>
        <p>Some former big leaguers were not so enthusiastic about having to audition for the Olympic team. Wade Boggs, Jimmy Key and Chili Davis  apparently believed that their resumes were enough to warrant consideration for a spot on the team. They weren't. Terry Steinbach, the catcher, is the only other former major leaguer with legitimate Olympic aspirations. He is playing in an independent league in Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday evening, Watson himself was in the stands at Somerset Baseball Park to observe the two former Yankees, and give himself a better idea of whom to recommend to the selection committee. What Watson saw was a somewhat chubbier-than-normal Raines and a still youthful-looking Kelly, both brimming with enthusiasm. They were playing against good competition -- most of the players in the league have had at least some Class AAA experience, and some of them have played in the majors.</p>
        <p>''This is no hometown beer league,'' said Sparky Lyle, the former Yankee pitcher and manager of the Patriots who, at 56, retains his handlebar mustache, though it is now mostly white. ''Some are young and were on the bubble of making it from college to signing with a major league organization, and some are older and at the end of their rope. But all these guys can play.''</p>
        <p>As a result, the four games would be a legitimate test for both Raines and Kelly, both of whom were coming back from physical problems. Last season, Raines, while playing for Oakland, had contracted lupus, a disease that attacks the body's immune system. The stocky, 5-foot 8-inch Raines had lost 15 pounds and a lot of strength, going down to 170, but has recovered and put back those 15 pounds, and perhaps another 20. The Yankees gave him another look in the spring, but he broke his toe, and that ended his chances.</p>
        <p>Both Raines and Kelly had worked out on their own before coming to New Jersey. ''But hitting off a tee and running sprints,'' Raines said, ''isn't the same thing as live competition.''</p>
        <p>In their first three games, all against the Bridgeport Bluefish, Raines and Kelly had traded off being the designated hitter, as well as serving time in the field. Each was playing his first game in four months. Raines had two hits in eight tries with one run batted in -- one of his hits came on an infield roller that the one-time base-stealing ace beat out, though he appeared winded from the sprint. Kelly was 2 for 9, with 1 run batted in as well. Each had performed adequately at his position in the field.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when guys retire, they shut down,'' said Watson, before last Thursday's game against the Atlantic City Surf. ''And both Raines and Kelly retired. I want to see what their enthusiasm is, how they set up in the field -- if they're in the game -- and how they run and field and hit. I want to see what their bat speed is like, if they've knocked some of the rust off. Right now, there are about 70 candidates for the 24 positions on the Olympic team, plus 6 alternates. For Tim and Pat, their credentials speak for themselves. But they still have to be better than someone else.''</p>
        <p>In last Thursday's game, with Watson watching, Raines had two hits in three at-bats, with a double off the center-field fence that missed being a homer by about a foot. Kelly also went 2 for 3 -- 2 singles -- and threw well but made an error when the ball popped out of his glove on a tag play at second.</p>
        <p>Still, Watson said he was impressed with Raines and Kelly. ''I like what I've seen,'' he said. ''I like their body language. They took up my challenge to play in competition. I feel positive about them.''</p>
        <p>Both Raines, who thinks he may also have a few more major league seasons left, and Kelly, who knows he doesn't, understand that even if they make the Olympic team, they may not even be starting players.</p>
        <p>''The team will be mostly Triple- and Double-A All-Stars,'' said Kelly.</p>
        <p>In the two previous Olympics in which baseball was a medal sport, the United States team consisted only of amateurs and ended up with one bronze medal to show for its efforts.</p>
        <p>''I think the selection committee may be looking for guys like Tim and me for experience, guys who've been in pressure situations -- like the playoffs and World Series,'' added Kelly. ''If we can work with the younger guys, and maybe even just be there for important pinch-hitting, that'll be fine with me.''</p>
        <p>Raines agreed. ''If I'm not selected, I won't feel snubbed,'' he said. ''If it's the end of the road, it's the end of the road.''</p>
