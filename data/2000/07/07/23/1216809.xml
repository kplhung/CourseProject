        <p>SUNNYVALE</p>
        <p>The Rise and Fall</p>
        <p>of a Silicon Valley Family.</p>
        <p>By Jeff Goodell.</p>
        <p>252 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>It's no wonder that Darwinian models of society are so popular these days. Great technological leaps tend to leave many people behind, and citing ''the survival of the fittest'' is still the niftiest guilt-free way to account for those struggling in the wake of change. It's fun to talk about the visionaries, the I.P.O. tycoons, even the average person empowered by the personal computer. But what about those who are ill equipped to hop on the digital express?</p>
        <p>''Sunnyvale,'' Jeff Goodell's affecting memoir, has just these people in mind. Its irony-saturated title alone might tip you off that all hasn't always been well in the California birthplace of the computer revolution, which happens to be Goodell's home turf, too. A seasoned technology journalist, Goodell has now turned his eye on his own beginnings in the land that launched a billion microchips, and it's not always a pretty sight.</p>
        <p>''I loved the word Sunnyvale,'' Goodell writes. ''It was different from the names of towns around us -- like San Jose and Palo Alto and San Francisco, which had a dreamy, old Spanish romance about them. And it was not a name like Silicon Valley, which Sunnyvale was right in the middle of, but which always made me think of breasts and robots.'' Sunnyvale, for Goodell, possessed that eternal optimism that, as his epigraph from Kafka reminds us, is the American trademark. But optimism has a price -- namely, disappointment. The first glimmerings come when Goodell, the oldest of three children, is 19; he watches his family endure a painful divorce. His father, Ray, is a landscaper and a good family man, but his penchant for substituting home improvement projects for real emotional interaction has driven the mother of his children away. She lands a new job at a computer start-up called -- you guessed it -- Apple.</p>
        <p>''Sunnyvale'' isn't, however, about those famous garage-geek prophets Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. It's about people who can't speak their hearts even as they watch the world they know spin away. Though his mother has broken up the family, it's his father whom the young Goodell grows to resent. The man's poor business decisions, and his helplessness in the high-speed economy, are too much for his son to bear. Goodell keeps his distance as Ray -- who is estranged from his own father, a celebrated engineer -- retreats further into his Stone Age faith in home, hearth and earth even as he occupies a grim condo. Meanwhile Goodell does a brief stint at Apple, too -- the company is ''just I.B.M. with long hair,'' he believes -- before setting out for Lake Tahoe to work in the casinos. ''So, basically, you're a Luddite,'' Goodell's boss at Apple, who is soon to be an overnight millionaire, tells him at their goodbye lunch.</p>
        <p>But as his later career would make obvious, it wasn't fear of machines that sent Goodell packing. He needed to escape the stultification, and the heartache, he felt at home, even if home was the epicenter of a brave (and arrogant) new world. After Tahoe, Goodell attends Berkeley and then moves to New York, where he falls in love and discovers his journalistic calling. Escape is not so simple for his younger brother, Jerry, an aspiring musician. Goodell watches his brother self-destruct through drug and alcohol abuse, and he tries to pin down a cause for it: ''Maybe Jerry was doomed by a clump of disfigured receptors deep in his hypothalamus,'' he writes. At another point, he adds: ''He was an old-fashioned romantic and completely at odds with the reigning faith of the world we grew up in, which held that everything can be reduced to the ones and zeroes of computer code.''</p>
        <p>The book's attempt to contrast the cyberutopian ideal of Silicon Valley with the everyday suffering of a single family is occasionally a stretch, but Goodell's story, despite, or maybe because of, its inexorability, is riveting. When sickness and death ravage his universe, Goodell must confront what his hometown has always taught him to ignore. ''It was as if by moving to a town with a deathless name like Sunnyvale, we had somehow found a loophole in life's mortality clause,'' he writes. Then he adds, ''Our days as immortals were over now.''</p>
