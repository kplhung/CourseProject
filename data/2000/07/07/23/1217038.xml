        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for the article on heavy backpacks in middle school (''Taking a Load Off Students' Shoulders,'' July 9). My district makes some accommodations but could make more. The more publicity this issue receives, the more likely schools will act. Another issue is the status of physical education classes in New Jersey. I recently learned that report card grades for gym cannot be pass/ fail -- they must be actual grades, according to state statute. Given that the teacher's evaluation is generally more subjective than in academic areas, it does not seem fair, especially whena student having difficulty in academic subjects is entitled to assistance (longer time to take tests, personal aide in classroom) not available to gym students.</p>
