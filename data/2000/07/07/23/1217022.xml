        <p>The poet Wallace Stevens was perhaps the spiritual granddaddy of site-specific art. Stevens's poem ''I Placed a Jar in Tennessee'' could apply to any space brought aesthetically alive by the right object.</p>
        <p>And round it was, upon a hill.</p>
        <p>It made the slovenly wilderness</p>
        <p>Surround that hill.</p>
        <p>Hartsdale is no wilderness, but a graceless traffic triangle near the train station was transformed last fall by the nearby placement of ''Calypso,'' a large, painted metal sculpture by Leon Smith. The piece was the first in what will be a changing exhibition of sculptures on the strip of lawn known as DeSanti Plaza. The current sculpture, ''Pier Glass,'' a five-foot reinforced cement work by Sarah Haviland of Peekskill, will be on view through Oct. 22. The work, depicting a curled woman with a plexiglass mirror on her back, represents a female Atlas, said Leslie Scheiblberg, who was appointed the site's curator by Paul J. Feiner, the town supervisor of Greenburgh.</p>
        <p>Ms. Scheiblberg, director of Gallery on the Hudson in Irvington, must consider both practical and artistic issues in her work. ''I ran 'Pier Glass' by the police to make sure the mirror wasn't a traffic hazard,'' she said. ''I'd love to use water in a piece, and for that I've called Public Works.''</p>
        <p>She's also eyeing a light post and wondering how to capitalize on the wind blowing down East Hartsdale Avenue.</p>
        <p>What are the criteria for public art? ''The artist has to be a recognized sculptor, and the whole fit has to be conducive to the site,'' Ms. Scheiblberg said. After that, the curator's own intuition and personality take over. ''The work will reflect what I see in that space,'' she said.</p>
