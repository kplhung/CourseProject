        <p>Here's what the critics are saying about Cary Hoffman, the Sinatra interpreter who can be heard every weekend at the Carnegie Club on West 56th Street in Midtown: ''Dead On!'' raves The New York Times.</p>
        <p>''He'll Blow You Away,'' claims New York 1.</p>
        <p>''I like salsa and merengue but he's all right,'' says Antonio Varela, a busboy at the Carnegie.</p>
        <p>Here's what at least one critic thinks of Steve Lippia, a former construction worker turned Sinatra stylist, who recently finished a week at Birdland:</p>
        <p>''He was silly, like an Elvis imitator,'' says Chip Defaa, a music reviewer for The New York Post. ''He didn't even look like the publicity photo. He was fat and short and he wore elevator shoes. Hoffman is better. He's just more sincere.''</p>
        <p>Cary Hoffman arrives to his show with sweat on his brow. It's been 18 solid weeks of standing room only but now these two-bit Sinatra impersonators are starting to crawl out of the walls.</p>
        <p>It's these kind of hacks, Mr. Hoffman says, that make you sweat. They make you work harder. They turn your homage into fromage.</p>
        <p>It's like playing the Catskills.</p>
        <p>''He didn't sound anything like him,'' Mr. Hoffman, 55, says of Mr. Lippia. ''And he dressed like a bum. He was strictly an imitator.''</p>
        <p>You can call Mr. Hoffman Old Four Eyes. Call him anything you want. Just don't call him an impersonator.</p>
        <p>''There is a fine line between the Rubenstein bar mitzvah and art,'' explains the pepper-haired Mr. Hoffman as he sits down for a pre-show Coke. ''I am, I must say with all humility, an artist.''</p>
        <p>There is an earnest quality in his voice and there is true virtuosity in his 15-piece orchestra, which plays the original arrangements of those old Capitol Records songs of the Chairman.</p>
        <p>It has been a long road to the top for Mr. Hoffman, who started with Sinatra records in his Long Island bedroom. He worked his way to crooning gigs in Catskill lounges. He wrote television jingles. He hit the country charts in the late 60's with ''Congratulations'' and ''The Last Person to See Him Alive.'' In 1986, he crossed over into the business side of entertainment by opening the comedy club Stand-Up N.Y. in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But now it's all about the music, Frank's music. To prepare for his show, Mr. Hoffman takes a steam shower, dresses in a starched shirt with studs and a tuxedo, and hums to himself for half an hour.</p>
        <p>The first show begins at 9:30 p.m. It costs $20, and there is a two-drink minimum. He plays to the locked-out-of-Broadway crowd: Japanese, Germans, suburbanites. The orchestra wheezes to life and curious faces from outside stare into the plate glass and then flicker away like ghosts in an old movie.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffman begins by saying something like ''If you're mad at your girl, if you're unhappy when the boat busts loose, you're on Whiskey Rocks Mountain.''</p>
        <p>And he slips neatly into ''I Could Have Danced All Night.''</p>
        <p>Sadly, Cary Hoffman is stuck being Cary Hoffman. But he does sound like Sinatra, and the couples get so close you can smell them. And over in the corner Antonio Varela, the busboy and music critic, is tapping his hands on the bar.</p>
