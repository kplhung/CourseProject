        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Invisible Hand of Uncle Sam'' (On the Contrary, July 2), in which Dan Akst saw the human genome project as just one example of how the federal government has assisted in economic development:</p>
        <p>I agree with Mr. Akst that ''the trick is being sensible, not dogmatic, about which things government can do and which it should leave to business.'' So far, however, the government has not taken up that challenge when it comes to Amtrak, which he suggested should be exposed to competition from private services.</p>
        <p>If we are ever to run more trains, better trains, on the routes that really need them, we should create regional agencies and put service out for competitive bids by private operators.</p>
        <p>My experience, however, is that Washington doesn't want a smart  dialogue on Amtrak. Indeed, status-quo defenders may succeed in pouring billions and billions more dollars into second-rate trains.</p>

        <p>The writer, the author of ''Derailed: What Went Wrong and What to Do About America's Passenger Trains'' (St. Martin's), recently resigned from the Amtrak Reform Council.</p>
