        <p>LEFT to my own devices, I would not have spent my first afternoon in London hanging out with men dressed as nuns.</p>
        <p>But my traveling companions -- two teenage boys -- overruled me and dragged me to the balcony of the Prince Charles Cinema for a showing of ''Sing-A-Long-a Sound of Music.'' Soon I found myself belting out ''Edelweiss'' along with my son, Will Griggs, 14, and his friend, Wyatt Fenner, 15, and cheering the guy in the yodel girl outfit who won the fancy-dress contest at intermission. And while I might have planned an itinerary of ambling through Hyde Park, picking my way through the antiques on Portobello Road and sipping Pimm's Cup at the Ivy in Covent Garden, I had to give in to the boys.</p>
        <p>And giving in to the boys turned out to be a good guiding principle for this trip.</p>
        <p>Our five-day jaunt to London in April was my fifth vacation with teens. Over spring break, while my husband putters in our garden and enjoys the suburban solitude, I usually go off with one or both of our teenage children (my daughter, Cornelia, then age 16, had different vacation dates this year), often with friends or a cousin in tow, to destinations that have also included Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Paris and the Bahamas.</p>
        <p>I always dread these trips and they always turn out great. They have produced some bad sunburns and sore feet but, amazingly, not even a small argument. With school out and many two-career couples trying to plan vacations that will appeal to teenagers, it helps to have a clear-headed view of what works and what doesn't. Today's sophisticated children are used to the stimulation of big cities (we live outside Washington, and my nephew, who sometimes travels with us, lives in New York). And many have travel opportunities that adults would envy. Yes, they are privileged, but they are still teenagers.</p>
        <p>Hearing that I'm about to travel alone with a gaggle of kids, I've had friends look at me with pity and share their favorite ''I took the trip from hormonal hell'' horror story. For example, a colleague told me about arriving with her 14-year-old daughter at the King David  Hotel in Jerusalem with a fabulous swimming pool. When she suggested a swim, her daughter responded that she preferred to retire to her room alone and order room service pizza.</p>
        <p>My nephew, now 21, sulked through much of a family drive through the Irish countryside two years ago and confided to me afterward that he rated a vacation in direct relation to the amount of time he was cooped up in a car with his parents. That's a cautionary note for parents who are planning to pile the teenagers into the S.U.V. this summer for a cross-country trek or a camping trip.</p>
        <p>I can empathize. At 16, on my first trip to Europe, I pretended to sleep during a car trip through the Alps because I wanted to punish my parents for relentlessly pressuring me to register my awe and delight at every sight.</p>
        <p>So I began traveling with my two teenage children with a proper sense of trepidation. But over the years, I've learned that one key to success is carefully mixing what they want to do with what you want to do.</p>
        <p>In London, that meant Tower of London, yes. (Like Queen Elizabeth I, teenagers like gory stuff and outsized diamonds.) British Museum, no. British war rooms, yes. (They've seen enough World War II movies to make Whitehall interesting.) Parliament, no.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, we all got dressed up for high tea at Brown's Hotel. (The boys' version of fancy dress for tea was nice sweaters, no dirty sneakers.) They loved the ritual of pouring the tea through a strainer and pronounced the lumps, Britain's far more interesting version of sugar cubes, ''awesome.'' Will, a piano player himself, enjoyed the Gershwin and Porter tunes played by the hotel's pianist.</p>
        <p>I got to go antiquing, in a manner of speaking, when Will took me vinyl shopping on Camden High Street and I found myself thumbing through long out-of-print 60's  albums at Rhythm Records. Greeting the visages of old friends like Peter Noone (Herman of Herman's Hermits) and Petula Clark (of ''Downtown'' fame), I felt as if I were back on Carnaby Street during my first trip to London in 1969.</p>
        <p>And that, essentially, is the joy of traveling with kids this age. It can re-establish the connections between your life and that of your teenagers, who often do their best to shut out their parents. That is the guiding spirit for the road rules I've developed.</p>
        <p>1. BE SPONTANEOUS. If you have your heart set on your teenagers' seeing every painting in the Louvre, you are  in for mal de mer. In Paris, my daughter, Cornelia, then 15, and her cousin Ted, 14, inhaled the Louvre one evening in less than two hours. They were more interested in the museum shop than the museum. I didn't push.</p>
        <p>Internecine warfare often begins when you are determined that kids see and take in all the classic sights. Instead, give them just a taste and hope that it will inspire them for a lifetime.</p>
        <p>2. THINK KITSCHY. Last year, Cornelia, Will and Ted lobbied hard to go to Atlantis in Nassau. They'd seen Atlantis's many television commercials and loved the look of this kitschy resort, best described as a combination of Disney World and Las Vegas built on a fabulous beach. Actually, two beaches -- a real and a fake.</p>
        <p>I would have much preferred a quieter place, but the three kids loved the elaborate water slides, the bustle of the giant hotel and the casino, where they courted danger and got thrills from trying to pump coins into the slot machines and ogling Michael Jordan, who was at the resort with his kids and hit the gaming tables at night. (When the three tried to use the slots, they were nearly always chased away by the pleasant but firm hotel staff, since anyone gambling must be at least 21.)</p>
        <p>And Atlantis turned out to be a great place for real talks. Every afternoon, I persuaded one of the kids to take a long beach walk, which gave me a chance to catch up on what each of them was up to.</p>
        <p>Tackiness ruled in 1997, when the kids chose Las Vegas as our destination. My two kids each took a friend, whose parents chipped in to cover their expenses. They loved the kitsch, from the fake pyramids at the Luxor to the mock Coney Island of New York, New York. While the amusement park at the MGM Grand occupied an afternoon, they also enjoyed an old-fashioned stage show with the requisite white-suited and sequinned Elvis impersonators.</p>
        <p>I got into the flashy spirit of things by renting a stretch limo (white with purple-tinted windows) for a 45-minute ride down the Strip.</p>
        <p>3. DON'T CHANGE THE SLEEP CYCLE. Teenagers sleep an average of 20 out of 24 hours, or so it seems on vacation. Don't mess with this sleep cycle by planning early excursions. In Paris with Cornelia and Ted in 1998, I let them sleep until noon. I got up early, got coffee and a croissant at a patisserie near our Left Bank hotel, and went for walks and museum visits on my own, or with my sister, who joined us on this trip.</p>
        <p>The teenage metabolism got jump-started later, and they were in a better mood to see Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower. They were enthusiastic about Paris night life, including eating late in nice restaurants. Although they complained a bit about all the walking,  our outings were liberally sprinkled with shopping in trendy boutiques like Agnes B. And Ted, a gifted artist, liked drawing the gargoyles at Notre Dame.,</p>
        <p>4. DON'T BOOK EXPENSIVE SIGHTSEEING EXPEDITIONS. I can't stand the idea of missing a famous landmark if it's in striking distance so, in Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon beckoned. The kids were game, and I spent $600 chartering a plane to fly us over the majestic site. On the flight, air turbulence made one of the kids sick and two others fell asleep; we would have been a lot happier spending the afternoon by the pool.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, the kids didn't recognize enough of the names of the old-time stars like Rita Hayworth and Clark Gable to make a slow ''Homes of the Stars'' bus tour worth an entire afternoon. But they loved the footprints at Mann's Chinese Theater.</p>
        <p>5. BUNK ALONE (IF BUDGET PERMITS). A vacation is not the optimum time to instill order.</p>
        <p>In Paris and Las Vegas, I shared a room with my daughter and her friend. Within a day, the floor was covered in dense layers of clothes, which made me crabby. Not having to keep her room neat was part of the point of a vacation, Cornelia pointed out, something I had agreed to in a weaker moment. Adults in one room, teenagers in another, is best if possible. At Atlantis, where I shared a room with a friend from home, we were all much happier.</p>
        <p>After supervising one eve-of-departure clean-up by the kids, I left a generous tip for the hotel maid to make up for their mess.</p>
        <p>With two 15-year-old males hovering between boyhood and manhood as my London mates, the young gentlemen, as the staff referred to them, had one minor mishap in the room they shared (mine was on another floor). They called me in a panic one night at 11, claiming to have ''mistakenly'' ordered an X-rated movie from the pay movie selections. (After selecting the movie, they probably realized their choice might appear on my bill.) I told them not to worry. Flexibility is good.</p>
        <p>6. A POOL RULES. In Los Angeles, I thought the kids would get a kick out of a cool Art Deco hotel in Santa Monica that I had always liked, the Shangri-La. I was wrong. Their interest in architecture was limited to the hotel's lack of a pool. I conceded defeat gracefully and checked us into a Holiday Inn a few blocks away, where our bland room was poolside. The kids were thrilled.</p>
        <p>In London, where my indulgence to myself was splurging on a lovely hotel, One Aldwych, my first glimpse of the boys came late in the morning, when they would meet me for a workout in the hotel gym. Then we'd all go for a swim in the blue-tiled pool, which played music underwater. The boys thought the pool was ''phat.''</p>
        <p>7. LOOSEN THE LEASH. It's important to find safe opportunities to let teenagers go off by themselves. Will and and his friend Wyatt love the theater. The three of us went to two plays,  then I let them have a night to themselves. I went to dinner with a friend living in London and they went to ''The Lion King'' and had dinner at Orso, a West End restaurant. They had a midnight curfew, which they dutifully observed.</p>
        <p>In Paris, while my sister and I attended a classical music concert, my daughter and her cousin went to a movie on the Champs-Elysees. They loved the independence and the daring sense of exploring on their own.</p>
        <p>8. GET A SWEET CAR. A convertible may cost extra, but if you are driving a lot, teenagers will tolerate the travel if you have a car they like. A CD player can overcome a lot of problems.</p>
        <p>9. THE MORE, THE MERRIER. Teenagers are pack animals. Let them bring friends. Often, other parents are thrilled when their children get an invitation to travel and they expect to help defray the cost. Having pals along makes any trip more fun and actually encourages better, more considerate behavior.</p>
        <p>Above all, these trips have reminded me how much fun it can be to hang out with teenagers. Instead of insisting they be little adults, you can try being a big kid; at least, that's my approach.</p>
