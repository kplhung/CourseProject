        <p>One of golf's oldest sayings is, ''Beware the ailing golfer.'' And through the years, ailing golfers have won championships: Ken Venturi staggering with heat prostration in the 1964 United States Open, and Ben Hogan wobbling on weary legs in the 1950 United States Open after recuperating from injuries in a highway crash.</p>
        <p>But if David Duval, six strokes behind Tiger Woods going into Sunday's final round of the 129th British Open, were to somehow win on the Old Course, he would justify the saying.</p>
        <p>Duval's ailing back was painful enough for him to stand instead of sit throughout his news conference in the media center following his six-under-par 66 in today's third round.</p>
        <p>''Today was the best I've felt all week,'' he said. ''For the most part I played pretty much pain free, but I just tried to do what I was instructed to do, which is not sit very much, and go lay down when I'm done and give myself the best chance to be pain free tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>With a birdie 3 on the 18th hole, Duval finished at 10 under par, which means he will be playing with Woods in Sunday's final pairing.</p>
        <p>''I most definitely wanted to get there,'' he said, referring to the final pairing. ''It will be a circus. It will be exciting. It will be a slugfest, whatever you want to call it. You get to look him in the eye. To get in the last group with undoubtedly the best player in the world right now is an experience you want to have. You're going to need to be there for this week and the P.G.A. Championship and for the next time it comes about.''</p>
        <p>Duval did not sound intimidated by Woods's six-shot lead with 18 holes remaining. ''Even if I'm as much as seven behind, I have a chance because I've won from that far behind before,'' Duval said. ''I'm going to be trying to win my first major championship. He's going to be going for the career Grand Slam. So there is going to be some pressure on both parties.'</p>
        <p>In the 1999 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Duval was seven strokes behind going into the final round but won with a 59 that tied the PGA Tour record. In the 1998 Shell Houston Open, he was six strokes behind and won with a 64.</p>
        <p>''I imagine I would need to shoot 66 again, if not a few better,'' Duval said. ''I feel like I got a lot out of my round today. It's one of the first times in a while where I walked off thinking that's the highest score I could have shot.''</p>
        <p>Needing a birdie on the 18th, Duval watched his tee shot drift toward the white cement out-of-bounds stakes along the street named The Links.</p>
        <p>''But when I walked off the tee and saw it land and saw it did not kick hard right like you would expect and it just fell left,'' Duval said, ''I felt I was getting the breaks I hadn't been getting lately. It was nice to see that again. When I made the birdie putt, I thought, 'I just turned a 6 into a 3.' That's what you need.''</p>
