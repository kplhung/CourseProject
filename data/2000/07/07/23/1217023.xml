        <p>In the article ''Pollution Police, Armed With Fly Rods'' [Westchester section, July 9], Jennifer Post, a state spokeswoman is cited, who claims the reason Westchester stream reclassification is taking such a long time is because it is a complicated and expensive process.</p>

        <p>Also, Ms. Post is presumably aware of the fact that upstate watersheds, which are much more watered, were reclassified years ago.</p>
        <p>One wonders: why the foot-dragging?</p>
        <p>Could it be that some stand to gain in this political procrastination? Perhaps one need look no further than those who continue to pollute our local rivers and streams, and those in the state who make little effort to stop them?</p>
        <p>Is there a connection?</p>
