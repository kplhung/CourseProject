        <p>THE ironies were thick on the ground. ''A. T.&amp; T. is the main corporate sponsor of American Mavericks'' was the sign that hit your eye as you entered Davies Symphony Hall last month. Then you picked up your program and read an essay by Alan Rich, ''No Brands, No Labels, No Boundaries,'' which did little but tack a brand label on the favored elite and reinforce an implicit boundary that enraged advocates of the unfavored many. Their postings clogged classical cyberspace in the weeks leading up to the San Francisco Symphony's American Mavericks festival and all through it. Everybody, it seemed, wanted in to the vaunted pack of loners, the in-group of outsiders, the icons of iconoclasm.</p>
        <p>Michael Tilson Thomas, the orchestra's music director and the gatekeeper of this Studio 54 of the excluded, worked hard to invest the theme with coherence. He carefully explained in a newspaper shortly before the festivities commenced that Elliott Carter, while a ''significant figure'' and ''to be admired,'' was no American Maverick because he was ''Eurocentric'' and ''brainy.'' So was this to be a replay of Philip Rahv's creaky old attempt to classify American writers as redskins and palefaces, Walt Whitmans and Henry Jameses, with no middle ground?</p>
        <p>Even John Adams, in a preconcert interview, invoked this stale bisection, old before he was born, to justify his inclusion among the mavericks. But Mr. Adams (tailed that evening by a PBS camera crew), while a significant figure and to be admired, is by now the very model of mainstream success, having earned his place in the sun by taming the excesses of Minimalism, once a maverick style, and reconciling it with traditional audience expectations.</p>
        <p>And who should turn up in the first program anyway? Milton Babbitt, the very icon of tenured palefacery. Nor, despite Mr. Thomas's anti-intellectual reassurances, did it turn out to be the Un-Carter Festival. Ursula Oppens, here to apply her elbows to Henry Cowell's Piano Concerto (pure-blooded redskin Schlockmaninoff, this), sneaked four recent Carter pieces into a preconcert feature. Pale they did seem. But in the company he kept that night (Cage, Cowell, David Del Tredici, Varese), Mr. Carter was definitely the odd man out. In short, a maverick.</p>
        <p>Well, enough of loophole-poking. For a couple of weeks it was the Bay Area's parlor game of choice, but now we're tired of it. There is more to be said -- seriously -- about the theme and about themes generally; but first some words of thanks are in order. Never in my concertgoing experience had I encountered such a catholic barrage of not-to-be-missed programming: Charles Ives, Morton Feldman, Terry Riley, Carl Ruggles, Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lukas Foss, Meredith Monk, Duke Ellington, George Antheil, Lou Harrison, Steve Reich, Earle Brown, Steven Mackey, Frank Zappa, Conlon Nancarrow and Aaron Copland, to run down the remaining roster of Mr. Thomas's choices in order of first appearance.</p>
        <p>The performances had their ups and downs, but even the downs were mostly good enough, while the ups were amazing. And big summer audiences (40 percent Symphony subscribers and 27 percent first-time attendees, according to the marketing department) lapped it all up. The evening of June 9 will stay forever in my memory for its sheer generosity. After Ruggles's ''Sun-Treader,'' Crawford Seeger's Andante for string orchestra, Mr. Foss's ''Time Cycle'' and three choruses from Ms. Monk's ''Atlas,'' Ives's Fourth Symphony was still to come. And after all that, hundreds of spectators stayed for Mr. Thomas's postconcert discussion with Mr. Foss, Mr. Harrison and Ms. Monk.</p>
        <p>Nor was the conductor's energetic largess his only, or even his most conspicuous, virtue. His energy flagged noticeably, if understandably, during the last week, which was largely given over to an, alas, equivocal showcase for his Miami-based training orchestra, the New World Symphony. With its fatigued maestro at the helm it gave a dullish concert, ending with a downright disengaged reading of Ives's Second Symphony that failed to solve, or even seriously address, the work's notorious balance problems.</p>
        <p>But everywhere else the maestro shone. His technique and his musical scrupulousness are simply beyond praise; in difficult music he is all business, giving beats and cues of impeccable clarity. And like Leonard Bernstein, with whom he is so often (and by now, I believe, justly) compared, he has the gift of vivid shape. The two-siren wail at the climax of Varese's ''Ameriques'' was so expertly judged, and the rest of the performance so admirably paced around it, that it became more than a moment of deafening exuberance (though it was that, too). It fixed the whole piece, in all its abounding detail, in a firm, indelible gestalt.</p>
        <p>Only once did the maestro seem to put himself before the music, when he turned Terry Riley's venerable ''In C'' into a public-relations stunt. Audience members were invited to bring along their instruments and participate in the performance. The predictable clambake was made worse when Mr. Thomas, in an effort to keep everyone amused (or keep himself at the center of things), usurped control over the proceedings, now hushing the parquet to allow the sounds from the balcony through, now running around the hall like Jerry Springer with a stick, to encourage (and comically overconduct) the riffings of individual audience members. Could he really have so misunderstood Mr. Riley's intentions? Or respected them so little?</p>
        <p>A good time was had by all; but the composer, forewarned, had stayed away. In the end the paying customers were cheated. Had they heard a real performance of the piece, its magical impersonal shimmer might have taken hold, and the improbable victory of the ''Minimalist revolution'' -- an avant-garde of harmonious simplicity, neither redskinned nor palefaced, not yet conventionalized for mainstream consumption -- might have been illuminated.</p>
        <p>But if an occasional overreach, or a bit of pandering in the press, is the price of the remarkable trust Mr. Thomas has built up with his audience (and his management), I'm ready to forgive and forget. His freedom to indulge his passionate predilections must be the envy of his peers, and it has redounded enormously to the benefit of the Bay Area's musical life. Put all the kvetching that follows in the perspective of the overriding debt of gratitude one owes for being given so much to think and yammer about.</p>
        <p>The opportunity to think and kvetch is of course the great value -- and the great danger -- of thematic programming. Mr. Thomas acknowledged what he saw as the danger on opening night, when he confessed himself (or affected) to be ''taken aback'' at the intensity with which the Mavericks idea -- just a marketing ploy, after all -- was being debated, implying that we might do better if we just sat back and listened.</p>
        <p>Sorry, Maestro. No can do. Welcome to the world of discourse (or buzz, if you're not an academic). Nobody just sits back and listens. Culture is baggage, and music cannot reach our ears except through a field of interpretation. The difference between a thematic program or festival and an ''ordinary'' concert is that an explicit field of interpretation is being proposed, and we can no more ignore it than we can follow the friendly alchemist's sure-fire recipe for turning lead into gold. (Ready? Just melt it down and stir for three hours without thinking of the word rhinoceros.)</p>
        <p>This time the theme proposed was fraught with volatile issues concerning American identity and the place of the arts in an egalitarian society. The danger is not that thinking about such things distracts our ears from pure sensuous or ''aesthetic'' engagement. Only Kant could ever be that ''disinterested,'' and only on a good day. No, the danger is that once the thinking starts, it cannot be contained. It leads where it will, if we're mentally alive, and not always to the intended celebration.</p>
        <p>Take that wonderful June 9 program. The opening was breathtaking. The timpanist, bestriding the top of an implied pyramid on a riser at the orchestra's rear, whacked out his barbaric yawp at the beginning of Rug gles's ''Sun-Treader'' with marvelously simulated abandon. Mr. Thomas pulled off his patented trick: never had the piece emerged with such expressive force but at the same time such lucidity of structure. And never, for all its redskinned, bear-skinned Americanism, had its line of descent from the majestic opening of Brahms's First Symphony been more robustly proclaimed.</p>
        <p>THE trouble was, that very clarity of structure bred unease by the time the piece was over. It is a sort of rondo, I realized, organized around three insistent returns of that opening tattoo. But by the fourth time around, that insistence, reinforced by the spectacular placement of the drummer, had become annoying. ''Oh, take it in the woods with Robert Bly,'' came unbidden to my mind's lips. And, yes, it even crossed my mind that Brahms might belong there, too. It's rather late in the day to be proclaiming one's Americanness, or one's musicality, with defiant displays of machismo. Never had Ruggles seemed so dated. Ditto Ives. Ditto Varese.</p>
        <p>The program notes were eloquent about the problems Crawford Seeger had to endure in her day because of the American modern-music world's misogyny, and about the impact of Babbittry (George this time, not Milton) on her style. Her Andante, gentle by comparison with ''Sun-Treader'' (as, in all fairness, is some of Ruggles), strongly resembles Samuel Barber's nearly contemporaneous Adagio for Strings. Both works are arrangements of slow movements from string quartets, and both follow a trajectory (at once formal and expressive) from a darkly plaintive low register to a plangent high.</p>
        <p>The difference is that Crawford Seeger's piece was pervasively ''dissonated'' (to take a word from the vocabulary of Charles Seeger, her husband and mentor) in obedience to the norms of maverick manliness, while Barber, a male composer with a solid conservatory education and good connections, was confident enough to withstand the pressure.</p>
        <p>With Toscanini on his side, he didn't need maverick credentials; academic credentials would do. But with the institutional victory of academic modernism after World War II, the shoe went on the other foot. Now it is Barber who stands in the cold, stigmatized as weak, derivative, unoriginal, unadventurous, safe (all euphemisms, of course, for ''sissy''). Mr. Thomas's show may not have been an un-Carter festival, but it certainly was an un-Barber festival.</p>
        <p>It would be rash to assume that Crawford Seeger tailored her style to macho expectations unwillingly. (I remember my mother walking on air after a truck driver leaned out of his cab and shouted, ''Lady, you drive just like a man.'') But the shortness of her career and the paucity of her output raise questions about the stresses she faced. Pushed to one extreme, she bounced (as radical conformists will) all the way to the other, forsaking classical composition for folk-song arranging. Meredith Monk's music, which avoids extremes and finds a place somewhere between classical intricacy and imagined folklore, answered Crawford Seeger's across the decades, hopefully suggesting that now there is room for a feminine perspective in ''serious'' music -- or, even better, that gender perspectives may no longer be all-ruling.</p>
        <p>But what about Ruggles? Was he not warped as well by those gender stresses? His works, too, were lamentably few, as were Varese's. Since the publication of Ives's ''Memos'' in the 1970's, we've known for a documented fact about the toll that male anxiety took on the maverick of all mavericks. The artificiality with which a lot of ''ultramodern'' American music was spiked up -- sometimes, as in Ives's well-known case, retroactively, when performances loomed -- may not have been just a response to an ''inevitable'' historical process. It may also have been a response to a noxious psychological pressure, one that such music, when uncritically celebrated, might continue to exert on its listeners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas put the best face on it. At the postconcert symposium he offered the suggestion that what makes Ives and Ruggles and Crawford Seeger so ''wondrous'' (his favorite word) is that for them dissonance was not ugly but ''affirmative.'' Yes, perhaps, but just what did it affirm? A passage in Leta E. Miller and Fredric Lieberman's excellent new biography of the latter-day maverick Lou Harrison sheds some chilling light on the question.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison began his career as a votary of Ives and Ruggles; but, as we heard in the late works of his that were played at the festival, he made a conscious detour, amounting to a repudiation, from the path of ''affirmative dissonance.'' His biographers associate that swerve with ''a luncheon at Pennsylvania Station in New York at which Ruggles blurted out antiblack and anti-Semitic slurs at the top of his lungs'' to Mr. Harrison's acute discomfiture. I for one am not prepared to assume that all the blurting at the top of his lungs that fills Ruggles's ''Sun-Treader'' is unrelated to the animus that appalled his friends, or that his magnificent artistic creations have played no part in its propagation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas himself furnished a case in point, when he took an especially blustery and embarrassing leaf from Ives's ''Memos'' to lend at least some negative coherence to his festival theme. ''What the mavericks did not do,'' he asserted in the program book, ''was make nice little pieces to fit comfortably into the nice little holes of traditional concert life.'' Doesn't he know that ''nice'' was Ives's code word for effeminate, and that it carried overtones of both misogyny and homophobia? Didn't he feel any hesitation before seconding Ives's and Ruggles's antiquated rhetoric of fear and loathing, one that would in all likelihood have applied to Mr. Thomas himself as it would to any Jewish or gay musician?</p>
        <p>Placing Mr. Harrison alongside his erstwhile mentors, like pitting Ms. Monk against Crawford Seeger, tacitly put the maverick generations in dialogue. That dialogue was most pointed on the touchy subject of technology. The official Mavericks line, as put out in San Francisco, hailed it with unbridled, naive optimism. Technology was the otherwise improbable Milton Babbitt's ticket of admission to maverickhood: he was represented by ''Philomel,'' a virtuoso aria for soprano (sung by Lauren Flanigan -- into her music stand, alas) with a taped accompaniment produced in 1964 on the room-filling RCA Mark II Synthesizer, the techiest medium of its day, with a price tag of $175,000 to prove it.</p>
        <p>Techmania reached its zenith on Antheil night, which featured the San Francisco premiere of the original 1924 version of ''Ballet Mecanique'' with 16 roaring pianolas and a whole kitchen of percussion. It was considered unperformable until last year, when Paul D. Lehrman, then on the faculty of the University of Massachusetts, coded its every note on a computer disk that could be hooked up via MIDI technology to a phalanx of Yamaha Disklaviers. The results were spectacularly loud, all right, and impressively rigorous, but they also exposed the spectacularly uninventive, vapid contents of the score on which all that care had been lavished.</p>
        <p>Antheil would no doubt have claimed in rebuttal that although the performance was powerful enough to overheat and disable two of the Disklaviers, it still did not fulfill his intentions, since, as Mr. Lehrman admitted, even with today's technology Antheil's prescribed tempos remain out of reach. The ''charm of impossibilities,'' as Messaien used to call it, still works its cheap magic. But as any composer (well, any honest composer) will tell you, to be difficult is the easiest thing in the world, and to be impossible takes no more than insouciance. The devoted to-do over Antheil's hoary charlatanry (though it brought us out in droves to hear it) was depressing to behold.</p>
        <p>It was consistent, however, with the negative reception accorded the one Mavericks offering that challenged the decrepit futurist aesthetic. That was ''Hindenburg,'' the first act of ''Three Tales,'' a documentary video opera in progress by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot, which delivered an unsubtle but effective sermon on technology gone wrong.</p>
        <p>The audience hated it. The postconcert discussion was a roast: no bad thing in itself, in fact a refreshing contrast to the perfunctory standing ovations most concerts nowadays elicit. But it was mostly beside the point, as were the fulminations in The San Francisco Chronicle a couple of days later concerning the wordless third scene, a fantasy on the Nibelung motif from Wagner's ''Ring'' that accompanied scenes of zeppelin construction. Mr. Reich was accused of drawing a ''causal link'' between Wagner and the Third Reich.</p>
        <p>HE did no such thing. The subjugation of the Nibelungs was not Wagner's doing, after all, but that of Alberich, the Jew capitalist in Wagner's intended allegory. Mr. Reich's point was complicated and ironic, and it was clear that he had touched a nerve. In so doing, he earned the only reception that matched the vaunted maverick legend of uncomprehending rejection.</p>
        <p>(But of course the ironies do not end there. They never end. Shaking a stick at scientific hubris is not exactly the freshest thing artists can do at the end of the 20th century, especially if their critique of high technology is mediated by state-of-the-art amplification and video equipment.)</p>
        <p>That one brush with controversy made the concluding Copland program seem a bit tame and safe, especially to those of us who had been tantalized by advance publicity promising a rare performance of ''The Lonesome Train'' by Earl Robinson alongside Copland. Trouble in obtaining performance material was officially cited as the reason for the cancellation, as well as the unavailability, I was told by the orchestra's publicist, of a ''name actor'' for the narrator's part.</p>
        <p>But when one recalled that the corny old cantata manages to put a paraphrase of the concluding line of the ''Communist Manifesto'' in Abraham Lincoln's mouth, it was hard to shake the suspicion that it had been dropped for other reasons. Too bad if it was. Like it or not, popular-front Communists (a category that included Copland) were genuine political mavericks in America, and the very best thing this festival could have accomplished would have been to get some neo-conservative critics yelling. As it was, we had a brilliantly guided museum tour, but we heard little evidence, Mr. Reich apart, that any real maverick spirit survives in classical music today.</p>
