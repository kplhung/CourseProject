        <p>ONLINE booksellers have no doubt changed the way books are bought and sold, but modern technology hasn't affected how the Pequot Library runs its annual book-sale extravaganza. The sale, which attracts book dealers from around the country who often wait in line the night before it opens, is run by scores of volunteers and raises enough money to pay for a major share of the library's yearly operating expenses. This all happens without one click of the mouse.</p>
        <p>The century-old library, housed in a stately stone building at 720 Pequot Avenue in Southport, has been holding its book sale since 1961 and it has become an annual event for book lovers. Last year, about 3,000 people attended, bought more than 100,000 books and raised between $90,000 to 100,000 for the library. ''It's the best treasure hunt in the whole world,'' said Shelley Stevenson Hall, a long-term volunteer who oversees the pricing and sorting of more than 5,000 boxes of books.</p>

        <p>ONLINE booksellers have no doubt changed the way books are bought and sold, but modern technology hasn't affected how the Pequot Library runs its annual book-sale extravaganza. The sale, which attracts book dealers from around the country who often wait in line the night before it opens, is run by scores of volunteers and raises enough money to pay for a major share of the library's yearly operating expenses. This all happens without one click of the mouse.</p>
        <p>The century-old library, housed in a stately stone building at 720 Pequot Avenue in Southport, has been holding its book sale since 1961 and it has become an annual event for book lovers. Last year, about 3,000 people attended, bought more than 100,000 books and raised between $90,000 to 100,000 for the library. ''It's the best treasure hunt in the whole world,'' said Shelley Stevenson Hall, a long-term volunteer who oversees the pricing and sorting of more than 5,000 boxes of books.</p>
        <p>And there are indeed treasures. Although the sale takes place in one of Connecticut's most elegant and charming communities, that ambience belies the fact that this is serious business. Last year, for instance, one of Andy Warhol's early books, the rare ''Twenty-Five Cats Named Sam and One Blue Pussy'' that was worth about $3,000 was among the thousands of books offered. With a book such as this, the library will research the book's market price and from that it charges only one-sixth of that amount. But on the first day, the library will double the price of the book. So, if one-sixth of the book's market value is $500, then it's sold for $1,000. Because some book dealers would love to get a peek of what's there before the sale officially begins, the Boy Scouts, along with their scoutmaster, camp out overnight to prevent dealers from sneaking into the tents during the night. Several years ago, a dealer stumbled over a sleeping scout, but there haven't been any problems since, Karl Kery, the scoutmaster, said.</p>
        <p>''It's fun for the boys and they get to perform community service,'' Mr. Kerry said, ''which they need for rank advancement.''</p>
        <p>After people have determined their pecking order, they line up. This year, the sale takes off on at 9 a.m on Friday., with a blast from the town cannon, fired by Arthur Sesselberg, chairman of the book sale committee and a library trustee. With the blast, the early-birds often run down the aisles to where the rare books are kept. The sale ends Tuesday, Aug. 1., at 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I love when Art fires the cannon -- it's like a gold rush,'' said Ruth Anne Baumgartner, coordinator of dozens of volunteer cashiers and salespeople.</p>
        <p>After the first day all remaining rare and special books are sold for half their first-day prices. ''We realize that the book dealers need to make a profit so this is why we do it this way,'' said Mary Freedman, the director of the library. Other rare fines include some valuable first editions, such as works by Henry David Thoreau and A. A. Milne. ''We've had some amazing donations over the years,'' Mr. Sesselberg said.</p>
        <p>The library gets many of the books for the sale from residents, many of whom work in the publishing industry. The also town is home to many wealthy families that have been there for generations, so the books they donate may indeed include first editions, Mr. Sesselberg said.</p>
        <p>There are thousands of books to comb through, and most of the book prices are extremely low. A hard cover sells for an average $2 per book, and paperbacks are priced around 50 cents. While the rock-bottom prices are what lures many buyers, many also come to socialize with friends, said Pegeen Gaherin, a lifelong resident of Westport, one of Southport's neighboring towns. ''It's a big social scene,'' she said. ''Around this time of year, everybody starts talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Maybe that's why so many people volunteer to help out during the sale. The event attracts about 100 volunteers, many of whom have full-time jobs, not to mention families. Ms. Baumgartner, for one, teaches at Fairfield University and Southern Connecticut State University, is a playwright, and is the artistic director of Pequot's Bare Bones Theater.</p>
        <p>''Without the volunteers, the sale wouldn't happen,'' Mrs. Hall said.</p>
        <p>Although the success of the event hinges on the volunteers, it wouldn't work without a well-defined process. Granted, the library has had 39 years to perfect its system, but there are thousands of books that have to be assigned to various categories. And they don't arrive in any order, either.</p>
        <p>The process starts with Jim Crane, a library staff member and one of the few paid workers in the sale. Each morning, he lugs books from the barn in back of the library into the library cellar. ''We have to hire about 14 burly guys to help Jim take the books out for the sale,'' Ms. Freedman said.</p>
        <p>Once in the cellar, the books have to be sorted, priced, boxed and labeled.</p>
        <p>All the books are checked to assure they're in salable condition, as well. There are about 35 categories to which the books can be assigned. The volunteers' interest and knowledge will determine what category they oversee. But because there's some overlap, this can cause debate among the volunteers about which category a book should go in. ''It can get pretty ugly,'' Mr. Sesselberg said.</p>
        <p>It can also get complicated if something breaks down during the process, such as the conveyor belt that brings the books from the cellar to the tents. Then there's the weather.</p>
        <p>Ms. Freedman said she recalled a time when a heavy rain had weighed down the huge canvas tents, so much so, that the seams almost split, which would have doused the books with gallons of water. Fortunately, a local teenager cut a hose in half and siphoned the water off.</p>
        <p>Library officials said they need a good turnout because it's the most important fund-raiser of the year. The library raises 60 percent of its operating expenses through fund-raisers and contributions, while the remainder comes from the town of Fairfield. ''This sale helps pay the salaries, pay the electricity and other bills,'' Ms. Freedman, the library director, said. ''This helps keeps the doors open -- without it, we would have to cut back on library hours and there would be fewer books on the shelves.''</p>
