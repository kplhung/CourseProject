        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Daphne Merkin's review of ''Mockingbird Years'' (June 25) accomplishes more, alas, in five minutes than many ''50-minute hours.'' As a psychoanalyst in private practice, I agree with the reviewer and the witty author, Emily Fox Gordon, that too much of what passes for psychotherapy is essentially a diagnostic process rather than a transformation. To my dismay, fascination with diagnostic processes -- what's wrong, who's to blame, endless descriptions of what the problems are -- is often mistaken for actual treatment.</p>

        <p>Daphne Merkin's review of ''Mockingbird Years'' (June 25) accomplishes more, alas, in five minutes than many ''50-minute hours.'' As a psychoanalyst in private practice, I agree with the reviewer and the witty author, Emily Fox Gordon, that too much of what passes for psychotherapy is essentially a diagnostic process rather than a transformation. To my dismay, fascination with diagnostic processes -- what's wrong, who's to blame, endless descriptions of what the problems are -- is often mistaken for actual treatment.</p>
        <p>Psychoanalysis has long been enamored -- rightfully -- of the discovery techniques that Freud created. But discovery is not change, and no wonder there's a need for the ''closely guarded secret'' behind closed doors; the secret is that, often, so little happens. Real therapy is about creating a brand-new experience of safety, a kind of safety never before experienced in the patient's life. This kind of safety provides the atmosphere for inspired guidance and, for the patient, the courage to attempt new behavior.</p>
