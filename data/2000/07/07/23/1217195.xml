        <p>AUDIENCE. That's the word Steve Phillips used for what he hoped to be granted by Barry Larkin.</p>
        <p>It is a rather grand word, associated more with a pope or perhaps the queen of England than the shortstop of the Cincinnati Reds. But these are unusual times, and millionaire All-Stars have a certain aura all their own.</p>
        <p>Besides, Larkin has a rather more mobile status than either a pontiff or a monarch. He could be talked out of his perch in Cincinnati somewhat more easily than the others from their sites in the Vatican or Buckingham Palace.</p>
        <p>At any rate, Larkin is so desirable that the Mets had a private airplane all gassed up and ready to roll at an airport in New York, just waiting for word that the regal eminence in the Queen City was ready to grant that aforementioned audience.</p>
        <p>The Mets seem to think they need Larkin so badly that, according to Phillips, the two very distant Mets' owners, Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday, would have been willing to put themselves in the same pressurized cabin for hours at a time. Talk about pulling out all the stops.</p>
        <p>The little bags of peanuts were already stocked on Wilpon's plane. (That's a joke about little bags of peanuts; the players' union specifies caviar for audience flights.) The pillows were fluffed; the boarding passes assigned. (Mr. Wilpon, please, way over here. Mr. Doubleday, please, way over there.)</p>
        <p>But then Larkin said it was far too soon in this little courtship dance to encourage an entourage to fly from Atlanta to Cincinnati last night, so the Mets went out and beat the Braves, 4-0, with no field trip afterward. The general manager and cast still have two full days to try to persuade Larkin to come to New York. The silly season continues.</p>
        <p>It is not to baseball's credit that teams divest themselves of established stars toward the end of July. It is contemptuous of the fans who purchased those extremely expensive tickets to have management suddenly say, ''Ha-ha, but Barry Larkin (or Mark McGwire, or David Cone, or Randy Johnson) doesn't play here anymore because we're trying to save money and are giving up on this season, but don't even think of asking for your money back.'' The attendance got trimmed again, as Casey Stengel used to say.</p>
        <p>The attendance is really getting trimmed in tiny-market Cincinnati, which fought its way into a one-game playoff last season. A truly mean person would call this the Curse of Junior, referring to the gloomy miasma of Ken Griffey Jr., who talked his way out of Seattle. Now Edgar Martinez is having a superstar year in Seattle, and the Reds can't discard their expensive stars fast enough, but to dwell on that particular superstar migration would be unkind.</p>
        <p>The Mets have high respect for Larkin. John Franco, a former Red, was willing to fly to Cincinnati last evening for an audience -- Phillips's word again -- and so was Phillips, of course, as well as Bobby Valentine.</p>
        <p>The manager's feelings were difficult to fathom. Valentine knows Larkin from coaching there for most of the 1993 season, and had only good things to say about Larkin, which makes sense, considering he may be managing him in a day or three.</p>
        <p>''Looked good, spoke well, played well,'' was Valentine's memory of Larkin trying to hold things together on ''a team in disarray at best.''</p>
        <p>That was then. Larkin is now 36 and wants a three-year contract. He did not appear in any rush to grant an audience to a contingent trying to soft-soap him into three months of a pennant race in New York.</p>
        <p>The issue is not whether Larkin needs the Mets. The issue is whether the Mets need Larkin. They have Rey Ordonez, a sensational fielder but ghastly offensive player, out for the season with a wrist injury and signed to $16 million over the next three years. The Mets are clearly interested in Alex Rodriguez of Seattle, who is clearly interested in them, if only for the titillation of driving his price even higher.</p>
        <p>And the Mets have Melvin Mora, who is not only a highly classy individual but can also play an adequate shortstop for a contending team.</p>
        <p>Valentine said it is not a matter of ego that he thinks he can win with this team; it is a matter of confidence in the players.</p>
        <p>''If you don't, you should get another job,'' said Valentine, who admitted he has heard some managers say, ''We are not getting it done with this group.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, who has had his differences with Todd Hundley, Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla, seems to like his current team, adding: ''If somebody can come and make you a little better, that's good. But it doesn't make you worse if he doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Balance is a funny thing. With three regular infielders currently out of action, the Mets are getting things done with appealing players like Mora, Lenny Harris and Joe McEwing. Nothing against Barry Larkin, a mature professional, but a residual sense of loyalty and curiosity and fun whispers that the Mets just might be able to win with their current team -- without going through the perhaps even degrading machinations of a charter flight for an audience with a reluctant star.</p>
