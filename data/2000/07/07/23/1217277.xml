        <p>Back in 1964, Mamie Cunningham, then a 22-year-old college student, was one of the black Freedom Democrats from Mississippi who journeyed to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City to challenge the all-white makeup of her state's delegation.

        <p>Back in 1964, Mamie Cunningham, then a 22-year-old college student, was one of the black Freedom Democrats from Mississippi who journeyed to the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City to challenge the all-white makeup of her state's delegation. The challenge caused considerable turmoil, but in the end she was not allowed to be a delegate and was forced to observe the proceedings from the boardwalk outside the convention hall.</p>
        <p>Thirty-six years and a civil rights revolution later, Ms. Cunningham, now a 58-year-old teacher, is still involved in Mississippi politics. In fact, two months ago she was chosen to be a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Alas, it will not happen.</p>
        <p>In the civil rights movement, too, what goes around comes around.</p>
        <p>An Asian-American challenged the makeup of this year's Mississippi delegation, saying that when it came to male delegates, only blacks and whites had been chosen and a slot traditionally reserved for someone of another race had not been filled. Party officials investigated, and while they found no merit in the challenge, they did find that the delegation had two more women than men.</p>
        <p>They made Ms. Cunningham an alternate delegate and gave her delegate slot to a man, a state senator. A delegation out of gender balance, they explained, might not be seated.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be, more or less, an observer again,'' Ms. Cunningham lamented.</p>
