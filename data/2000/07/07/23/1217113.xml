        <p>Michael W Hovey letter responds to July 16 article, on absence of post-cold war arms control policy</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Cold War Lives: In Search of a Missing Link in the Logic of Arms Control'' (Week in Review, July 16), you quote Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona: ''Would we really incinerate every Iraqi because of some action by Saddam Hussein? I'm not sure we would, and I'm not sure we should.''</p>
        <p>I suggest that Senator Kyl visit the cities and atomic bomb museums of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to help him resolve any uncertainty. While stationed at the American Navy base in Sasebo, Japan, I paid several visits to the nearby city of Nagasaki and its bomb museum. Any ideas I had held about the justification for the use of such weapons were quickly swept away by the sickening realization that we killed nearly 75,000 men, women and children in a flash.</p>

        <p>Photos of children burned to a crisp have a way of clearing up lingering doubts about the ''proper'' use of nuclear weapons.</p>
