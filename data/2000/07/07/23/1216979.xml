        <p>WHILE accidents caused by gas leaks in homes are relatively rare, when they do occur they can be devastating. Here are some tips for dealing with gas appliances and equipment in and around your house or apartment.</p>
        <p>''When gas lines and gas appliances are installed and maintained properly, they're not going to be a problem,'' said Ralph DiBiase, the service manager of Public Service Electric and Gas, a utility company based in Newark. ''But when you're dealing with gas, you can never take anything for granted.''</p>
        <p>One way natural gas can pose a potential problem for a homeowner, Mr. DiBiase said,  is when there is a leak or break in the gas pipe buried outside the house.</p>
        <p>''Because gas is lighter than air, it seeks the path of least resistance into the atmosphere,'' he said. ''That means that if there is a leak in the gas line running from the street to the house, and the gas is looking for the path of least resistance, that path might be through a crack in the foundation.''</p>
        <p>Although the chances of an exterior gas leak making its way into the house through the foundation are unlikely under ordinary circumstances, he said, the possibility increases in winter because the frozen ground could prevent the leaking gas from rising  out of the ground and instead force it to migrate toward the foundation.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Mr. DiBiase said, if underground gas lines are left undisturbed, they  are not likely to develop leaks. Unfortunately, they are not always left undisturbed.</p>
        <p>For example, he said, a homeowner or worker digging outside the house -- installing anything from a fence post to a swimming pool -- could strike and damage an underground utility pipe. While most such pipes are buried at least three feet underground to be below the frost line and protected from freeze-thaw cycles, a previous owner could have changed the grading of the land or the pipe could have been buried closer to the surface because of topographical considerations or soil conditions.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. DiBiase said, a homeowner or contractor digging where pipes or power lines may be buried should call the utility companies that service the house to determine exactly where the utilities are located. (Most states have set up a number to take all such calls. In New Jersey it is 800-272-1000, in Connecticut, 800-922-4455, and in New York City and Long Island, 800-272-4480. Elsewhere in New York State the number is 800-962-7962.)</p>
        <p>Ed Yutkowitz, a spokesman for the Keyspan Corporation, the Brooklyn company that provides natural gas service to about 1.6 million homes in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island, said gas lines and appliances inside the house are also potential problems. As a result, he said, all gas appliances should be kept clean and well maintained and should be inspected regularly.</p>
        <p>Ovens should be checked to ensure that all pilot lights are lit and stay lit and that all burners work properly, Mr. Yutkowitz said. Flames on gas appliances should burn blue, not yellow or orange. ''Any color other than blue means that the gas is not burning properly,'' he said, explaining that improper combustion in a gas appliance can produce dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless and potentially deadly gas.</p>
        <p>Homeowners should also be careful when moving stoves and clothes dryers because they are usually connected to the gas supply by what is known as a flex connector. That connector, designed to bend without kinking, can develop leaks if stretched too far or bent too frequently.</p>
        <p>''If the flex hose is old or deteriorated, you might want to have it replaced,'' Mr. Yutkowitz said, adding that Keyspan maintains lists of contractors who can be hired to perform such services.</p>
        <p>Most homeowners, he said, first detect a gas leak by smelling it.  (While natural gas has no odor of its own, a chemical is added to give it its distinct aroma.) Other things can  also indicate a potential gas problem.</p>
        <p>If there is no gas or the pressure is low (indicated by a low flame) at all of a home's gas appliances, that could indicate a leak in the line elsewhere in the house or outside. Another danger sign would be the inability to shut off gas to an appliance or heating unit.</p>
        <p>In either case, and whenever the smell of gas is detected in a house, Mr. Yutkowitz said, the homeowner should immediately leave, being careful not to smoke, light matches or operate any electrical appliances or switches on the way out.</p>
        <p>''If you want to, you can open doors and windows before you leave, but just make sure you avoid doing anything that could create a spark, including picking up the telephone,'' he said, adding that once outside the house the homeowner should use a public telephone or a neighbor's telephone to call 911 and the local utility company. Homeowners should not use a cordless phone to make the call, he said, since that would activate the base unit inside the house.</p>
        <p>Susan Spear, director of education and safety for the National Propane Gas Association, a trade organization based in Lisle, Ill., said similar cautions and procedures should be used with appliances fueled by propane gas. ''Propane is widely used in areas where natural gas is not available,'' she said, explaining that the fuel, derived from natural gas and is stored in liquid form in metal cylinders, also has an odor added to it so that it is recognizable if it leaks.</p>
        <p>Unlike natural gas, however, propane is slightly heavier than air and dissipates more slowly. As a result, Ms. Spear said, if propane leaks from a tank or an appliance, it can accumulate on the floor in combustible concentrations, even in a room that is ventilated.</p>
        <p>''It's not a good idea to use propane above the first floor of a building,'' she said, explaining that if a tank is dropped and the valve is broken or leaks, the gas could escape and drift down stairways to the floors below.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spear added that all propane tanks should be inspected regularly for rust and corrosion and to ensure that their valves are operating properly. Moreover, she said, propane tanks should never be filled to more than 80 percent of their capacity and should always be stored outside.</p>
        <p>Homeowners should also make sure that appliances that are to be used with propane or natural gas have the proper burners installed for the type of fuel being used. For example, Ms. Spear said, a clothes dryer or barbecue grill that is set up to be used with propane fuel cannot simply be attached to a natural gas line without changing the orifice size of the burner.</p>
        <p>''If the orifice size isn't correct, that can potentially lead to high levels of carbon monoxide,'' she said, adding that the conversion, as well as any work on gas lines or appliances, should be done by a professional.</p>
        <p>Robert Bellini, vice president of Varsity Plumbing and Heating in Flushing, agreed. ''Homeowners think that if they can buy something at Home Depot, they can legally install it,'' he said. ''But any time you are working on gas lines or installing new gas equipment or appliances, you need a licensed plumber to do it and he has to take out a permit.''</p>
        <p>And while it is legal for homeowners to replace existing gas appliances themselves, Mr. Bellini said, it is not necessarily wise to do so.</p>
        <p>''Messing around with gas lines is one thing you really don't want a handyman to do,'' he said. ''Even when the handyman is you.''</p>
